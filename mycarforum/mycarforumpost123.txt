Another Hong Kong celebrity has expressed interest in buying Singapore property just a few days after actress Carina Lau announced she is considering it as well, media reports stated.
Andy Lau (pictured), one of Hong Kong's four ‘Heavenly Kings’, said he was thinking of purchasing a home in the city-state.Speaking to the media ahead of the world premiere of his movie ‘Firestorm’, Lau said he only invests in property since he isn’t familiar with other types of investments. This prompted a reporter to ask if he had thought about purchasing a property here, to which he replied that he had planned to do so. But it did not materialise due to the high property prices. The emcee at the press conference then informed him that the government had introduced market cooling measures. Lau then said he hoped the cooling measures will work and that property prices will drop. He also revealed that he had been “following the property scene in Singapore” while his friends had been advising him which properties are good investments.

Looks like Singapore becoming another HK in terms of trajectory of the property market.
 
Even the Chief Executive of HK, Leung Chun-Ying, owns property here. One in River Valley Road, another in Coronation Road West.
 
Info: http://www.ceo.gov.hk/eng/pdf/RI_CE.pdf
(HK senior officials need to declare their financial and other interests and post all of it online)

Coronation Road West mainly bungalows and GCBs.  But then again, he is a "special" foreigner with super VIP status.

SINGAPORE: Many online home rental websites in Singapore include the words "No Indians, no People's Republic of China (PRC)", which is sometimes followed by the word "sorry", leading to increasing rental discrimination in the city.The issue appears more common with less expensive properties and on sites where content is posted directly by users, the Online Citizen reported.The president of the Universal Society of Hinduism (USH), Rajan Zed, has called on Singapore's President Tony Tan and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to put an end to the discrimination, which is becoming a rising menace.The emergence of anti-foreigner sentiments in Singapore has become a major cause of concern, with the government constantly urging the Singaporeans to welcome expatriates and to help them integrate into the city-state's multi-cultural society.One Indian expatriate said his agent told him that many landlords would refuse to rent flats to him because "Indians always cook smelly curries", BBC reported.Charlene, an estate agent, said it was common for landlords not to rent houses to tenants from India or China because such tenants "are not people who are house proud"."Many don't clean weekly, and they do heavy cooking, so dust and oil collect over the months. They may use a lot of spices that release smells people don't like," Charlene added.Singapore is one of the ethnically most diverse nations, consisting mainly of Chinese-origin people along with Malay, Indian and other ethnic groups.
