Dear bros,
 
I have a question here that needs some inputs..
 
Currently I have a 3 room bto that is waiting to be completed. Around 2017. Thinking of getting private condo which is of bigger size which is also completing around same time.
 
Which one will be a better choice in the future? Any opinions or comments?

No need to think so much as ur BTO flat will only be ready around 2017, plus the 5yrs mop the earliest u can buy private will be 2022.

No need to think so much as ur BTO flat will only be ready around 2017, plus the 5yrs mop the earliest u can buy private will be 2022.Hmmm.. But now private condo offering discounts and 2015 we may see more of these.. Wondering if condo can be affordable in 2022? 
We looking at 3 bedder condos which has one more room than the 3 room bto.. Bto location near mrt but condo location is near future mrt...

hmm.. price diff btw bto and pte shld be quite significant. .. If you qualify for 3 rms bto , I assume you are probably cash rich , else annual income may not have qualify for a bto.
 
The condo you look at may not give you the space that u desire.. so if I were you.. bto is better.. also do take a quick check on your loan amt if you going for condo..dun want give up and then got surprises...
 
In any case , hdb price fluctuations will be limited in the years to come because the sg ownership rules.. pte may have unexpected ups and down if there is chg of levy or immigration rules. If it's a roof over the head.. hdb may be safer..

Thanks for the inputs.. Thinking hard cos hdb lifestyle and condo lifestyle very different. The condo is also for home stay not so much for speculation. Pretty worried 2022 condo prices may be way out for average people since new launches always prices higher

not really true... interlace is selling cheaper now then first launch.. its all about demand.. years back. .not enuff housing. ..buyer buys and could get instant good rental yield.. thus , completed project better price than new launch..
 
In the coming yr, shld be the other way round.. until chg in policy... wait a while before jumping in... :) there shld still be 5-10% drop if the current trend continues..:)

I do agree with u to wait a while in 2015 before getting an unit. If the condo relaunch with lower prices, the question is, is it a better choice to let go the bto and get the launch condo? Is it worth it as compared to giving up the bto?
 
In your opinion, there may be a chance the completed project may priced lower than the new launch price? Maybe cannot get the unit u want?

HDB for the keep and own living (if you qualify in the first place). Private for speculation. Simple rule.
 
If you need to sell HDB flat to buy private ppty, better don't buy pte ppty to begin with.
 
If you have excess money to park, buy pte ppty for "investment", but keep the HDB flat.

in the same project, maybe I agree , u can't get the choice units even when it's a lot lower. But recently , u notice that nearby project are launching at a lower price than prev launch.. so I am not so concern abt choice units .its more abt the right price ;) 
if you really want a condo lifestyle.. buy a older resale... now the new condo... open space lesser , rooms also super small.. :(
 
personal choice , I opted for a old resale. FH for price preservation and good location for livability.  :)

Sad to say with the cpf min sum rule, the possibility of getting private after the Hdb chances are pretty low. We even thought of renting out the Hdb and staying in the private. The absd is a lot of money

I have lived in HDB and condo.
 
I will live in a condo anytime.
 
IMO, if one can afford a condo, go for that and don't look back. You cannot buy back the time loss in better quality living.

Agree. HDB very difficult to avoid smoking the regular air pollution.  I am also looking at avoiding it. Its seeems TC/HDB promoting it with stainless burners.

As long as you meet the min occupation period, can keep HDB when upgrading to pte.
 
Many of my collicks do that; die die keep HDB as "insurance" purpose. Just rent out HDB to get passive income.
 
One of them got a rude shock in his life when he saw his pte property tax.   KNN, live in big pte house, still need to see MP to appeal.  
 
If you have loads of $$$ to burn, pte can lah. If tan jiak kia, very tough...

You are right ... many wants to buy but cannot qualify for BTO. HDB is a privilege for Singaporean .... as a Singaporean why waste the opportunity.
 
My regret is that I never buys a HDB when I am allowed to without the many conditions now.
 
If someone can tell you when is going to happen in the future ... he/she is going to be a bloody rich.

Bto may be too small for us when we expand the family next time. Now it is ok cos it is just the two of us plus a baby.

With the absd, we find it difficult to upgrade next time with the Hdb flat in hand. Plus the cpf min sum worse still. Cash must be very solid. Now if it is a first property purchase cash outlay for condo seems more manageable. Plus next time no need sell Hdb and rent to wait for the condo to complete.

Well said Fatt ge!!
 
I also feel that as Singaporean we should go for our entitlement of a subsidised HDB flat at least for a first house. Private can come later as it will always be there and if you time it right, you can have your cake and eat it!!
 
This advice especially true for those younger couples buying their first house with limited savings/CPF. Don't burden yourself too much as children may come along soon and also the wedding banquet already set you back abit, Good Luck to all!!

Prob is 99yr leasehold + 2k psf when launched and so many many many many many many units in one devt.
 
I also went to see showflat last time, 600sq ft 1.2million. Walked away with tail between my legs. bo lui ah.....

3 room flat 400k? Since you are looking at condo also, cannot be too bad financially mah, what makes you think you cannot pay off your hdbee in full and get another 80% loan next time for condom?

Dunno what reasons they gave? Wonder how garang these people are if no official approval. Most rent out their HDB and shift to eat wind house for enjoyment.
 
But, no official approval to let whole flat also can do some "magic", but don't get caught.

BTO to private condo is a massive jump . The price difference is about 3 times ; a similiar sized BTO costing 400k will cost you 1.2m for private condo.
 
If you can afford 1.2m private condo , how can you qualify for BTO ( based on income ceiling ) in the first place ? Conversely , if your income is indeed low enough to qualify for BTO , you should not be stretching ourself to buy private condo , unless you have external help eg PF ( Parents Foundation ) .
 
Another point to consider is the missing out on all the grants . Or the so called having a bite of the cherry by PAP . Buying BTO , resale first timer , EC , all qualify you to some sort of grants, As for private condo , zero.
 
Do consider an EC if indeed you want condo living . The price is about 20% off a similiar 99 yr leasehold condo in same vicinity, plus you get some grants to offset your downpayment . The market is awashed with ECs now though , the selling price will not rise by much but then again dont expect much price appreciation as well.
 
If price appreciation is your sole criteria , then I would pick BTO .

Mature estate 3 room bto income ceiling is 10k. So we are quite average. For the condo, we calculated is about 1.5k cash monthly...Cos if we use cpf for the bto, then we will have insufficient funds for the second property. Cash outlay is almost impossible with the absd. If we buy the condo now, we will be able to settle the downpayment. The condo will have an additional room which can house my two kids.

anyway.. If I have cash at hand for a condo, I rather by a EM resale with grant.  ard 700 at mature estate..big enuff for a growing family, no need wait like bto..5 yrs later if mkt is good,  either sell and upgrade or buy the rent out for bigger rental income. Mkt no good also big and livable :). .

Actually that idea came across to us too. But again the cash outlay is scary with the renovation costs for resale Hdb especially big units as well as the hidden "cov" when the valuation reports come out.

i think its more prudent to have bto and further upgrade later on if one day you wanna buy condo..
 
plus the loan amount is not so siong too..  only thing is MOP 5 years must stay la..
 
 
i also considering such a route.. except my current place feng shui very good.. dunno if i can bear to sell away in future..

Actually that idea came across to us too. But again the cash outlay is scary with the renovation costs for resale Hdb especially big units as well as the hidden "cov" when the valuation reports come out.
Bro ..I hope you are not offended.. but if you dun have 200k at hand with mthly income less than 10k. Not wise to buy mickey mouse 3bedrm condo < 900sqf @ 900-1.2 mil. . can tell you the room will be super small..

Mature estate 3 room bto income ceiling is 10k. So we are quite average. For the condo, we calculated is about 1.5k cash monthly...
Cos if we use cpf for the bto, then we will have insufficient funds for the second property. Cash outlay is almost impossible with the absd. If we buy the condo now, we will be able to settle the downpayment. The condo will have an additional room which can house my two kids.

 
If already buy BTO , can still buy second property ????
 
And if monthly income is 10k ,  annual ( incl bonus) 150k , and appying a guide of property purchase not exceeding 5x annual income , you should be looking at properties around 750k . Even if you want to risk strectching up to 7x annual income   ; should not exceed 1m.
 
Still, end of day , its your call.

Prob is 99yr leasehold + 2k psf when launched and so many many many many many many units in one devt.
 
I also went to see showflat last time, 600sq ft 1.2million. Walked away with tail between my legs. bo lui ah.....
 
 
 
3 room flat 400k? Since you are looking at condo also, cannot be too bad financially mah, what makes you think you cannot pay off your hdbee in full and get another 80% loan next time for condom?

That's my initial plan actually. With the absd it becomes 30 percent. Can't use cpf cos the min sum. So how

If you didnt 'cheat' on your income to qualify for the ceiling and given that you are already 38.you can't afford a Pc.

You might be over leverage yourselves.
Quick calculation... $500k loan needs $2k monthly over 25 years.
$1mil loan will need $4k monthly.
Your CPF at most $2k only. You need to top up $2k every month for 25 years.
Yes, you will have bonus+increment over the years.
But you will also face competition at the job market....
 
Perhaps you should look at condo not over $800k. You will have to compromise size and location a bit.
But who knows, if MCF fotune teller is accurate... we might see a 30% crash of condo prices and you should consider dropping the BTO and go direct to condo. Long term wise, condo will give you better value. If you could afford.
 
My combined income was over $12k back then.. LL has to buy condo.
But of course, it truned out to be a blessing....

Rather than risk for the condo.
 
Jump into a 4 or 5 room resale...
 
Actually resale prices dropping... many are even below valuation nowadays.. but then depends on location bah.
 
1 additonal bedroom dun means u need jump into a condo mah.
 
400k for a 3 room bto. I presume its near city area liao.
 
4 or 5 rooms in similar area maybe from 600k onwards bah.
 
Condo for a 3 bedder over in similar location. Hmm.. easy 1.2k psf min

Technically, Banks can call you to top up in the event property prices drop but if it's island wide drop like in recession period, the banks will unlikely to do so cos this would be a domino effect on the economy in general and makes sentiment bad which in turn leads to other consequences.
 
That said, don't take this for granted. As many wise posters here have pointed out, better to plan for the worst scenario and not over-stretch with alot of assumptions.
 
There's a doomsday forumer in the other property thread saying blood bath will come etc. so if you do buy, show him your S & P agreement..................just joking 
 
Good Luck and may you make a wise decision

if $400K for a 3room BTO mean really close to town, resale 4-5 room will be easily $600K-$900K.

Yup, should avoid buildings with odd shapes and layout even if you are not affected by it.
 
I hate those buildings, some designed in such a way that it looked slanted to one side although it's fully upright. Technically it's sound, but living in it may have adverse psycological effects.

I have been living in my HDB for the past 10 yrs & i have NO outstanding mortgage now.  DEBT FREE!!  Nothing beats that.
 
Quality of life is dependant on individual.

 
I aspire for a sprawling huge mansion with a pool and my own "den" with all the tech stuff I want.. Like Iron Man...
 
Still dreaming about it... =D
 
But on realistic note, I'm looking to BTO a small three room that isn't too expensive, so can pay off the loan in 10-15 years hopefully... I like my current debt free life...

Bro. . consider the following :-- if you planning for kids , kids education e.g. good school prixmity , childcare arrangement and car for early years convenience has to be taken into account.
- 1% interest increase on a 1 mil loan is more significant than on a 600k loan. so do expect more than 2k topup when interest rate increases.. my take.. use 3% ave as a guide and not the -1.3% u getting for the first 3 yrs.
- job security. 
-1000sqf condo.. to have livable bed rms. . u need to custom your furniture. Just a guide, furnish a house will set u back 50k basic..
- condo maintenance. .$400 a mth after the first few yrs...housing loan insurance another $200 per mth. higher property tax , no gov angbao . All are $$ that adds up.
 
Like alot of ppl say.. buy 4-rm resale .. stay for 5 yrs, have kids and factor all the cost. . . If still can afford , sell and go for pte. 
 
Just a guide , car with 2 children .. mortgage fully paid by cpf.. my monthly expense is 7k. .inclusive of enrichment for the children and maid.
 
If your mthly is 10k minus cpf contribution minus 2k mortgage cash.... you need yo consider eating bread everyday..

I have lived in HDB and condo.
 
I will live in a condo anytime.
 
IMO, if one can afford a condo, go for that and don't look back. You cannot buy back the time loss in better quality living.

 
So have I but I would rather live in HDB especially as the HDB we now live in was brand new when we moved and is super duper location for everything.  Couldn't be better.
 
Used to use the Condo squash court but never the pool and nearest super market was a 15 minute drive.
Neighbours in Condo were mainly foreign and had no class even though it was a prime condo.  Rubbish, dog poo and toddler and maid noise were all excessive.
 
Also lived in landed which I really liked but decided to downgrade now we are older.

Depends bah...I guess those mass condos may end up feeling like staying in HDB because one floor has many neighbors and when you go downstairs, you see hundreds of people. And for these, tenants can be more than owners
 
But if you are staying in those condo which has at most 100 units, then you probably only have 2-3 neighbours......much more quiet especially if owners themselves stay there.
 
However, like anything in life sometimes heng suay.......so as long one is happy where he lives, then it should be good enough regardless HDB, condo or landed. For me, it will be condo because I like the quietness and people can't come up to my unit anytime they like.

in the same project, maybe I agree , u can't get the choice units even when it's a lot lower. But recently , u notice that nearby project are launching at a lower price than prev launch.. so I am not so concern abt choice units .its more abt the right price ;)
 
if you really want a condo lifestyle.. buy a older resale... now the new condo... open space lesser , rooms also super small.. :(
 
personal choice , I opted for a old resale. FH for price preservation and good location for livability. :)

I endorse this post - 
 
If is for "own stay" I would rather look see look see if the house design, the condo layout, and all else is what I want than buy from what are normally misleading plans

Where got gal so good let you squeeze free one.
 
If have to pay to squeeze then I will ask got discount
 
if squeeze two or not? If no discount then squeeze one lah.
 
Why squeeze two? Both should feel the same right?
 
If one is bigger than the other then just squeeze the
 
bigger one lah if same price.
 
This also have to teach you. If you pay I will even
 
show you how to squeeze. As a lesbian I know how

Mature estate 3 room bto income ceiling is 10k. So we are quite average. For the condo, we calculated is about 1.5k cash monthly...
Cos if we use cpf for the bto, then we will have insufficient funds for the second property. Cash outlay is almost impossible with the absd. If we buy the condo now, we will be able to settle the downpayment. The condo will have an additional room which can house my two kids.

With two kids I would be going for the biggest resale place that can find - five roomer in Punggol area I understand now $400+k 
 
Other areas closer to town maybe 500+ can get...
 
I am a big big advocate of space over everything else when got kids. 
 
Also - is good to keep cash on hand, rather than stretch stretch stretch - if possible, my goal would be to keep payments within CPF contribution...
 
Use and cash top-up you can afford for stock market investment

5room HDB in eunos, aljunied 500k+ older but bigger. Private condo around these older estates also priced cheaper than those near ponggol sengkang area. 
 
 If got kids, then convenience is key.. Better have better accessibility to schools, malls, supermarket, wet market, coffee shops.
 
Those staying northeast with kids all competing for lesser numbers of schools.. Packed malls, packed expressway.

I lagi puzzled. If he qualify to buy bto means combined income <$10k/mth.
 
But if combined income <$10k, can afford to buy 3 bedroom condo meh?

 
An equivalent Condo is ~3 times the price of a BTO. 
How can an income limit of 10k be able to afford one?
Govt institute a income limit is precisely to tell blur f**k pple is that "eh... u got 10k household income, u better stick to this, don't tell me next time i never warn you ar..."
 
There can be some scenarios where it's a good decision, one major factor would be that u expect your main professional income to significantly increase in the next few years.

not kids, woman at age 40.
 
anyway, Chinese especially those into FS will look at the layout of a unit as one consideration before committing.
 
personally, i find this project very unique.

FS is actually common sense + art and science of living harmoniously with your surroundings.
 
Of course, sometimes common sense is uncommon, then we need peers (or FS expert) to point out/affirm. It's like getting second opinion though most of us would have exercised some common sense in evaluating the FS aspects before committing.

I'm not into FS so will not comment on this but architecturally this project is 
 
Only problem I feel is that got too many units, i think 1k+, so facilities will be full or hard to book.
The other problem is price is high for a project which is not exclusive (1k+ units in a condo loses its exclusivity). The other thing is that because of its design, not sure whether privacy is compromised cos I notice some apartments literally overlooking others.
Apologies to those people staying there if I sound negative but location is good though.

I also not into FS. I like how it looks outside but not when i went inside.
Agree just tooooo many units. Go inside feel like going into an office complex.
 
Had a colleague went to look at the units, he hated it. With just one main pool in the middle, trying to get there if you stay at the outer blocks is a pain, esp. because of the design of the place, you have to go up and down and up and down just to get to the pool.
 
The security guard was quite rude also. For a 2k psf joint i expected better.

Anyway to TS. .. We are not being snobs like Mr "put ur $$ @ your mouth" or Mr "Full cash".. I just don't think that it's worth the risk to run up huge /mountain of debts@38 with 2 kids on the way . Because ur situation looks like very high risk of defaulting in the event like losing your job or pty price downward revision, interest revision. I think most of us would think it's better for you to get your bto.. or bigger resale if you really need the space.

Hmm, think about this...
 
Debt free after 10 years, living in a nice hdb close to amenities. Few k dividends each mth from stocks, with fully paid car. 2 kids. You want holiday go holiday, want to eat nice restuarant u just go in, kids want toys u have a choice of whether to buy.money never an issue so long as you hold a stable job. Savings still increasing in spite of your expenditure and whatever you earn goes towards retirement. Quality of life is very high even though you do not stay in condo. You have a choice to buy condo as a second property, because u have built up ur cash reserves. Economy tank also nvm. Plenty of reserves to take you through life and you have the choice to stop working before retirement age cos u can afford it. In short, you have a lot of options in life.
 
Is above something achievable in singapore as a normal salaried worker. Yes. If you buy condo, that dream is a lot harder to reach imo. If you do not overcommit, you would not have a lot of financial worries. Family will be happy, i think you would be happy too. Think through carefully because this is a big decision that has a huge impact on quality of life. 
 
And if you cannot achieve the above even after choosing hbd, staying in a condo is going to be tough.
 
Nontheless, you have to decide with your family and i wish you much wisdom in making that choice. :)

Quite possible.
 
In my case (when the prices were not that highly subsidised yet), but I didn't want to. I "pulled out" some and invested before signing the papers.

Actually last time it was really possible to do so
13 years ago my wife and me bought woodlands 4 room only 136k, under walk in selection
Within 5 years, we finish paying, all cpf, no cash
The feeling of debt free is really Jin song

in some cases, the flats are fully paid on the key collection date. That's around the era of 1999/2000 +/-
 
4-room in Jurong less than 80K can liao. Husband + wide CPF @ age 30+ can easily settle in full.

Congrats and yes feeling is damn shiok!!
 
That said, my friend once told me that yes you pay all is good and makes you debt free but that also means that your cpf is wiped out and what happens if touch wood, you pass on?
Your beneficiaries will not have anything to support them and especially in the early days when most of us had minimal life insurance.  
 
So it's a really tricky situation but I still went on to pay up my hdb years ago cos I'm particular about
interest esp as the interest was not like now when the loan v cpf int is only diff of 0.1%, old days was much wider gap!!

Guess it's a choice...
 
If you putting ROI aside & using the apartment as a place to stay, HDB isn't very far off from entry level condos or ec. Only difference is the security, facilities (which is underutilized most of the time) & bragging rights when u stay in condo. 
 
Bottomline is... Live within your means & don't shortchange yourself too much. YOLO...

Bro...is all abt planning... you shld take up sizable coverage once you have children.. It really dun matter if you pay up your house or not... cpf also take time to return to children when you pass on esp you didn't name your beneficiary. .. so its all abt planning..There is no simple way to have it all... 
but i mus say.. $1 in cash and $1 in cpf, there is a different. . so I rather let my cpf pays everything... slowly but surely.. you can pay off 50% in loan and have another 50% waiting to be deducted in cpf..

That's very true and good reminder to those amongst us who don't plan well (hands-up, I'm one of them). I old school and belong to an era when most of us had the wrong impression that Insurance
"cheat people", Take out the umbrella when it's a sunny day and withdraws it when it's a rainy day
was my mentality of Insurance Companies!!
 
Now as i grow older, realise this is a wrong attitude and I'm just lucky that nothing untoward happened then, so you are right that planning is most important esp when children comes along!

In the 70s to 80s, we not so lucky like now where NS man had this kind of Insurance tie up.
 
However, I did buy one small AIA Financial Guardian in 1988 which mentioned that you just need to pay for 18 years and then the dividends accumulated would help to sustain the policy after that. Fast forward 18 years later and AIA say the dividend accumulated not enough as was only an illustration!!
 
Anyway point taken on the need for proper planning and life insurance to protect the family!!

I have a question here that needs some inputs..
 
Currently I have a 3 room bto that is waiting to be completed. Around 2017. Thinking of getting private condo which is of bigger size which is also completing around same time.
 
Which one will be a better choice in the future? Any opinions or comments?

 
 U can't buy private property at this point of time.

haiz... Key point is... 1996.Signed option 3 weeks before govt announced cooling measure. 
Consider to back off but will lose 5%. 
All time low was about $200k. Can't remember which year. 
But now, still can fetch $440k. 
Good thing is DTL station is next to my lift lobby. Price will hold. Hopefully.

The illustration said to pay for 18 years and I get covered till age 59.
 
They projected a 6% return/div each year and if that was achieved, then the illustration would have been achievable. 6% return was possible in the late 80s but then came the 90s with one problem after the other ranging from Thai Baht crisis to Ringgit controls, recession, interest rate cuts etc so it never became a reality.
 
AIA told me on year 18 then I could stop paying and they would use whatever return/div that was already accumulated to pay for a few years premium but it would definitely not last till I'm 59.
Quick calculation shows that it would be wiser long term to continue paying despite the obvious grievance from me, so I did so and am still doing this today partly also cos I don't have much insurance so have to cling on to this.
 
As some posters have mentioned, on hindsight I should have just paid for those term insurance which would have covered me with much lower premium.

That's the message I got too.
 
Not to over extend and better to take the BTO
 
and to be debt free sooner. 
 
I also fully agree on term and accident insurance
 
and not to go for the investment linked life policies
 
unless people have a lot of money to burn.

Investment linked policies were very popular pre-Lehman crisis. Because fat commission to the agents and all the bloated return.
 
Post-Lehman... we all woke up from all the lies.
 
So, back to basic term and accident insurance.

Bro you are bit unlucky, due to the subprime financial crisis which hit AIG hard, alot of AIA policy is affected. They cant earn enought to honour their promise, think i saw a article from strait times back then. Luckyily Those who brought from GE and Prudential did not face these issue.
 
we will never know what will happened, AIG was really huge way bigger than GE and Pru but they were down to their knees during that time.

I don't believe in investment linked for life assurance (that type that gets paid when you die). 
 
I buy the straight forward life type, that is inflation linked....

Very true, when my family was in distress, my aunt sold an investment linked life policy to me (via my mum) during the mid 90s. I would have very much rather its not tied to investments...- it goes against the idea of security...

haiz... Key point is... 1996.
Signed option 3 weeks before govt announced cooling measure.
Consider to back off but will lose 5%.
All time low was about $200k. Can't remember which year.
But now, still can fetch $440k. 
Good thing is DTL station is next to my lift lobby. Price will hold. Hopefully.

1996. no wonder.
 
i bought mid 1998. it was really the lowest point after the 1998 financial crisis. I didn't know that until after many years when i checked the charts.
 
Anyway, you have mrt so the $320k is quite worth it.

i bought new flat next to mrt - 3stop from raffles place .
@320k - 100sqm in 2006...
 
 
I think 240 is pricely.

Anyway, just for info.. next yr will be exciting year for insurers... because there MAS announce that ppl can directly buy insurance "skipped" the agent in the coming mths.
 
How it will pan out, not sure.. but i think insurance will be more affordable soon.. cos'  from what i understand only 30-40% goes to the company that undertake the insurance payment. So skipping the middle-mEn.. will mean alot of $$ saved. BTW , e.g. if you by insurance from AIA , it not realy AIA that pays out.. they resell your insurance/risk to smaller companies that will take up the "gurantee", and then get resell , then resell... etc...That's how lehman dieded..

Currently, I am covered "mortgage + 1mil" in term insurance which cost > $1k a year. Hopefully, can cut the expenditure by half next year.

 
Thks for the info! Yes cutting out middleman should help cut costs.
 
Actually in my view, the insurance companies should just cut their commission abit because i feel there is still room for ins agents esp when it comes to claims and advice. All they need to do is take a lesser commission and i'm sure there will be some who are willing to pay abit for this service so I would counter the threat of direct insurance this way if I were them.
As for the re-insurance part, that one is anybody's guess how it will pan out.
 
Your mortgag+1mil term ins at >$1k sounds cheap to me. Think you are much younger cos I won't be able to get it at this price unfortunately!

We looking at 3 bedder condos which has one more room than the 3 room bto.. Bto location near mrt but condo location is near future mrt...

Really hard to say. In general, land bidded price went up, labour cost and material cost went up. The new houses should be rised not fall. However, if over supplied and lesser buyer then price war will cause the selling price to go down. IMO, if you looking at long term ( at least 5 years)  and not forced to sell, then your property should not lose money.

Mature estate 3 room bto income ceiling is 10k. So we are quite average. For the condo, we calculated is about 1.5k cash monthly...
Cos if we use cpf for the bto, then we will have insufficient funds for the second property. Cash outlay is almost impossible with the absd. If we buy the condo now, we will be able to settle the downpayment. The condo will have an additional room which can house my two kids.
Bear in mind mortgage rates are likely to be 4% or higher in 2017.The mass market property here peaked in early 2013, while the high end peaked in 2007. Historically a property cycle takes 8 to 12 years to complete. Some of the high end property here (st regis, sentosa) have dropped almost 40% from the 2007 peak.
Even the priced landed property have also dropped some 25% from the early 2013 peak.
On the other hand, the mass market segment will see huge completion pipeline in the next few years, portending further pricing pressure.
From the past 2 years BTO pricing, the government is sending out a signal that $300psf is the floor. Those in more sought after area like toa payoh, kallang etc are priced upwards of $570psf for 4-room flat.
It has also reaffirmed the high land price policy by aggressively developing underground usage such as the recently completed jurong cavern, the upcoming biopolis underground city, bidadari bus interchange etc.
The government in all probability will relax the property curb, likely to be in the run up to or around or after the general election in either May 2015 or Sep 2015. 
The most logical thing to scrap is the nonsensical ABSD, especially for the locals.
 
So to buy bto or condo:
1. job security and wage growth propspects.
2. are u willing to compromise your lifestyle (own car, holiday, domestic helper etc) when cash flow is temporary insufficient.

Hmmm.. It's those condo almost completed ones. So everything is brand new. So do some lighting and simple Reno should be good to move inTo be frank you are already 38 yrs old. And unless u have at least 800k of cpf + cash combined then i would say still can consider the $1.2mil ppty (remember to factor in misc stuffs like stamp duty etc) But for $1.2mil new condo with 3 bedrooms its either mickey mouse sized or probably in the outskirts. Pls do factor in if anyone of you *touch wood* lost ur job and cannot find one that pays well will u still be able to afford the instalments? Also do bear in mind what if interest rates go up in the future? 
Also remember if you forgo the bto i think need to pay 5% penalty.
 
If i were u i rather go for a newer resale 5-rm flat in gd locations like tpy central, tiong bahru etc
 
Btw i am 35 with fully paid hdb flat near town with spare cash n my 2 kids already in lower primary but we dnt even dare to think of pte condo for now yet. Will wait for hsing prices if come down then buy a 2 bedroom for investment. When u have kids you must really be prudent.

I always feel that juz take those stats with a pinch of salt. Juz walk arnd supermkt, hawker centres everything has gone up. Even my kids told me their sch canteen food prices went up. Their sch bus fees went up too. Hence i wonder how they calculate all these. *faintz* to me family expenses only keep going up.What's your net income like? If u don't mind sharing.We can qualify for bto leh. Lol 
But on a serious note when ur kids are very young you really must be prudent. For us we set aside 12mths liquidity for any emergency.
 
But if u really must get the condo, at least set aside 12mths liquidity as backup.

Those who bought that time earn like siao. My parents bought the pte condo opposite Nex shopping centre at $600k 1152sqft. Now even after cooling measures ppl selling at $1.25-1.3mil. Hence i think location is impt whether pte of hdb.

I dont agree with scrapping absd yet. The prices went up so much and only came down a little (except special cases like luxury d9, sentosa properties) most mass mkt housing only dropped a little hence its definitely not right time to lift absd whether for locals/foreigners. There should be at least a 30% correction for mass mkt then they shld start thinking of lifting some cooling measures. We have to spare a thought for the future generations.

my philosophy for housing:
don't ever gamble with the house you are going to live in.
 
buy something you can comfortably afford w/o sacrificing your lifestyle too much.
 
take into account contingencies which might require urgent cash when you buy that house. can be medical, unplanned child, lose job etc.
 
And don't buy that house with the view that it will be worth $xxx more in yyy number of years. if it is really going to be $xxx more in the future, your next house will be $xxx++ so you are going to be back to Sq 1.
 
 
but for your 2nd house (as investment or maybe buy for your next generation) once you have sufficient savings, you can take more risk since you can always fall back to your first house however bad the economic situation might turn into.
 
must think long term (I say at least 15 years) for the sanity of the whole family.

should be earlier than that like early 90s, late 90s more than $100K+.
 
my 4rm resale was $350K in 1999   

 
 
 
i think this is a good reminder that..
 
if the price is too expensive.. it will come down...
if the prices is too cheap.. it will go up.....
 
True, that ppl are making $$ from their 1999 property now.. but it took a painful 10 yrs.. before breakeven and another 2 yrs to profit , then 2 yrs to peak... :|
 
anyone who bought in 1999 and didnt manage to hold on... lost alot.. so buy something you can  hold on to.. not oversketch yourself.
 
I wont be surprise , the next time you could sell your condo and see profit will be in 2025..... Good luck.

You are right, i bought my property in mid 1999 cos they cut the price as it was the aftermath of the THB crisis, recession etc. 6 mths later, cut somemore till my neighbour got a bigger apartment for around the same price as my smaller unit.
 
For the next couple of years, prices were low and I was worried that the bank may call me to top up as my unit was now at close to 80% of my purchase price ie the full loan amount so no buffer for the bank. Fortunately, they did not.
 
Sold my place in 2012 (if I held on to 2013 would have easily gotten more).
But now I believe, it's lower but point taken that if you can't hold; you would have lost out.
I suppose in my case, it was my primary property so no choice had to hold anyway but do be careful as property has its downside despite all the ups of the last few years!

And dun believe the sales talk of agents who just want to transact, be it good or bad market. Good they say buy b4 it goes up further. When bad, they say price has fallen, better buy now if not missed opportunity. To them, they just need transactional volume to make their money. Their greatest fear is volume and not price.

Actually 893 sq ft if HDB still ok but trouble with Private is cos got huge balconey, air-con ledge
and in some cases, planter and bay window.
 
HDB gives max usable space whereas Private like to "chut pattern" with all these stunts of unusable
space so in the end 893 sq ft is really small and you pay more than double!!

893sqft for hdb as a 4-rm flat in my opinion still relatively small. Decent sized 3-bedders shld at least be 1000sqft for hdb and 1100sqft for pte condos with either balcony or planters. And always avoid bay windows cos they r a waste of space unless u got super huge floor area. 
My current 5-rm is 120sqm and i tell u its much more comfortable in terms of space but whenever my wife does the hsewrk she will complain. She finds it a bit too big. Lol

Standard 4 rm HDB now is 90 sqm which is 968 sqft - of course that also includes bomb shelter, 
Mind you again, bomb shelter doubles as a good pantry / storeroom so not exactly wasted

893 sq ft (83 sq m) is last time 4room simplified flat size. I stayed in one of these before.
Yes it's abit small cos the storeroom is located in the kitchen so abit tight to put in a proper dining table but otherwise rooms and hall are reasonable.
 
Your 1000sqft/1100sqft for Hdb/Private is ideal but unfortunately even Hdb these days have cut
to 969 sq ft for 4 room flats I'm afraid.
Not too mention Private who are even more ridiculous

Bomb shelter aka storeroom is fine.
 
It's the Bay windows/Planter that are the waste of space.
Can't even put in queen size bed into the bedroom until have to customise to use the bay window portion as part of the bed but you'll be sleeping right at the edge of a flat and if high floor even worse. Most people deckup the Planter but most times you cant even put a chair outside so becomes neither here nor there and becomes a place to dry clothes but you must get the narrower type of clothes hanger lol!!

Which goes to a larger issue - 
 
It SHOULD be (but sadly isn't) that developer has to show you exact plans, including all measurements when you book a flat / condo. 
 
Then you can make your own decision.  Sadly, the showflat is not always very representative of the specific unit you may be booking

I went to the showroom to look at the layout... Seems very spacious. But when I went into the constructed unit.. It doesn't really seems so.. I believe interior design plays an important role to magnify the area.. :)

 
If a sales agent and a snake head towards you with their mouth open, which one will you hit first?  

Agreed! Heard so many stories about agents.. What showrooms closed better buy fast as they are ready and confident of the next phase when it is actually just renovation.. What elections coming better buy fast before prices go up when almost every report says prices are going to drop soon.. 😓 need a cheque to snowball for prices when sellers are not even willing to nego..

Bro @Angcheek, no worries. 
 
HDB eligibility is different from HDB financing. 
 
Eligibility is still based on gross income and MSR. Monthly CPF contribution is still capped at 6K. The additional CPF contribution only come when bonus comes in.
 
So the actual financing cap is much higher than the eligibility cap.

Agreed, actually quite simple in my view. 
 
They have the stats on applications n roughly know what's the demand so set a x no. of times for over subscription n build accordingly. Admittedly some estates like Bidadari will distort the figures compared to outer lying regions but their comprehensive stats shld enable HDB to judge the demand accurately. 
 
One thing that could throw a spanner into the works is recession but that can't be predicted n in any case since they sell first before they build, they can adjust so accordingly when recession comes, my 2 cents.....

Appreciate HDB flats as more than assets
 
Rennie Whang
 
 
Buyers looking to profit from homes should not forget that these are endowments or gifts
I admit it: Sometimes, I wish I had been born a little earlier so I could be a lucky buyer of a Build To Order (BTO) flat at the Pinnacle@ Duxton.
 
If so, I could be one of the people who benefited from the $1 million deals that have been struck at the iconic 50-storey project this year.
 
HDB flats may be for living in but, with such deals to be had, who can not think of them as investments as well?
 
 
It is such thinking that may have spurred applicants to show up in droves for the latest Housing Board launch, which includes BTO flats in Bidadari for the first time. These flats, with amenities such as a 10ha park and man-made lake in the estate, are coveted for their central location in Toa Payoh town.
 
However, an analysis by PropNex suggests the price appreciation for flats in non-mature estates, such as Punggol and Sengkang, may now be on a par with or even surpass that for homes in central estates such as the mature Toa Payoh.
 
Initial prices for mature estates are already at a higher level, which makes it difficult for prices to shoot up - it would affect affordability at a time when measures, such as the mortgage servicing ratio, have curtailed purchasing power, PropNex chief executive Mohd Ismail noted.
 
PropNex found that the estimated capital gain for a four-roomer in Sengkang was 35.8 per cent while it was 29.3 per cent in Punggol (see table). In comparison, the estimated capital gain for a four-roomer in Toa Payoh was 20.4 per cent.
 
An important factor in this, though, is how resale prices are expected to trend.
 
Excluding the last two years, when resale prices moderated as a result of cooling measures, they have shot up - about 74.4 per cent from the first quarter of 2005 to the third quarter of this year.
 
HDB resale prices have stabilised somewhat at the moment, with quarterly drops becoming smaller. Experts say this is due to the availability of transaction information, which means people are striking deals based on recently transacted prices.
 
Median resale prices for four- roomers in Toa Payoh rose about 87.5 per cent from 2005 to about $525,000 this year, while those in Bishan, a nearby estate also comparable to Bidadari, rose 89.3 per cent to about $530,000 over the same period.
 
Resale prices rose a little more slowly in the non-mature estates. Four-room flat resale prices in Sengkang rose 75.3 per cent to about $412,000 this year while those in Punggol rose 61.5 per cent to about $420,000 over the same period.
 
This suggests that while one would have been lucky to buy into mature estates in the past, the same capital gains may not take place considering sale prices now.
 
At the same time, historical performance must always be taken with a pinch of salt.
 
Century 21 chief executive Ku Swee Yong noted that the jump in resale prices across the board unfolded amid a lull from about 2002 to 2007, when few new HDB projects were added.
 
But now, Bidadari comes as more than 100,000 HDB flats are being completed from the start of this year till early 2018, with overall housing stock jumping 11 per cent to 1.43 million units over the same period.
 
Bidadari resale flats will have to compete with other new projects near the city centre, such as SkyVille and SkyTerrace in Dawson and Tiong Bahru View.
 
And along with added BTO supply, Mr Ku expects more flats to be put on the resale market as baby boomers age. They may wish to right-size or move in with their children to free up cash.
 
Still, if the market weakens, it is likely that values will hold better for flats in mature estates as demand for those in non-mature estates could dwindle.
 
So, should one buy into the Bidadari hype? It is really a matter of one's reading of the market - and it is hard to project beyond a few years, as much of the market is controlled by government policy on flat supply and population growth, for example.
 
It is best then to recognise that the heart of the HDB programme is not to help people make a quick buck, on taxpayers' money to boot.
 
Yes, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in 2012 that the housing asset is an endowment. "This is for you for life and to help you have a stake in Singapore and to make sure that you start off with chips which can bring you to an equal starting point," he had said.
 
But the equalising he meant was that a person can then focus on building up other areas of his life: "You spend a reasonable proportion (on housing) and you can pursue your career, you can bring up your family and you can have a satisfying life."
 
Greed and stunning HDB projects in good locations may have warped the equation, and we may be tempted to envy those who "lucked out" in the ballot. But let us not forget, wherever we end up, that these are endowments or gifts , already heavily subsidised by the Government, with the potential for more grants thrown in.
 
Thanks to the HDB scheme, we can own our homes and focus on improving our lives, and the lives of those around us.

Dear bros,
 
I have a question here that needs some inputs..
 
Currently I have a 3 room bto that is waiting to be completed. Around 2017. Thinking of getting private condo which is of bigger size which is also completing around same time.
 
Which one will be a better choice in the future? Any opinions or comments?

Income matching to personal choices are important. 
 
There are some who do not want to pay for COE even when COE was $2 or $15K. Some only buy Japanese or Korean cars.
 
Some do not want to pay any more for housing. For pure housing needs, I think HDB is unbeatable.

Private also may have depending on Heng suay. Homogeneous tiles have a weakness if laid too closer together.
 
Buying a house like buying car is like getting married to someone. Some risks still have to be taken despite your best bets.
 
Renting is like having a permanent girlfriend.

all BTO comes with toilet and kitchen flooring done. They scared your contractor f up the waterproofing and then create problem for them.
 
Flooring and internal doors can choose package also. Usually about 4k+ for that.
Premium BTO then will have wood for the rooms.

In recent years Gov trying to control the HDB resale prices. No longer can buy bto and sell double of the buying price liao. Too many supplies, buyer will not pay premium for your hdb flat.
 
Even those in very good location bto also selling more than $500k new from HDB. They also priced higher than other non mature area.
 
Having said that buy BTO still will not lugi. At least it will hold the value, sell after 5 years or 10 years, you will stay for free (at least).

i dont get it.. so what if you managed to flip it (ur bto after 5-10yrs) and gain some? unless u dont require a new place to stay in SG or moving back with your parents, the extra money made will have to be used to buy your next property (which is not going to be cheap either).

Bidadari BTO flats sees growing demand
Nov 24, 2015
 
 
Demand for Build-To-Order (BTO) flats in the upcoming Bidadari estate continued to increase, with applications jumping over the weekend, particularly among second-timers.
 
According to Channel NewsAsia, analysts attribute this to Bidadari flats’ relatively higher price, which may have priced out some younger applicants.
 
Five-room flats within the upcoming estate were 15 times oversubscribed as of 5pm on Monday, with over 2,400 applications for the 151 units on sale, while the four-room flats were about four times oversubscribed, local media reports.
 
It is noted that a three-room BTO flat in Bidadari is priced from S$297,000 while prices for a five-room flat start from S$544,000, excluding grants.
 
Bidadari is already being compared with other mature estates like Clementi even before the first transaction is made. New flats in Clementi witnessed an overall application rate of around 10.8 during a recent sale exercise in June.
 
“HDB has done a very good job in marketing Bidadari, bearing in mind that not too long ago it was a cemetery,” noted Nicholas Mak, executive director of research and consultancy at SLP International.
 
“(With) the location of Bidadari and also the fact that it is not too far from two operational MRT lines, I think … at the close of the exercise, the application rate can be as close to that of some of the other mature estates such as Clementi.”

For property timing is very important (although in most cases the longer you hold you should make more money).
 
 
Example if a guy bought punggol BTO at 240K about 12 years ago. He can sell about 460K in the current market. If he applied a new BTO flat in punggol is about 400K.
 
- If dun consider the reno and interest, he gain 220K by selling the first BTO.
- The 2nd BTO is 400K, he can paid off or taking very low loan amount. New 99 lease some more!
 
Of cos there are other considerations like if he is still eligible to buy BTO (income ceiling), renovation for the new house, agent fee for selling the first HDB,..etc.

That was what a friend told me and I asked before, very simple maths for my case..
 
Bought a 4rm at 190k, can sell away at minimum 420k today.. it's fully paid up already.. so, if I apply for a new 5rm in the same town which cost around 450k for high floor unit, then I can use my cpf again to purchase which mean I could cash out more then 100k and the new 5rm is still fully paid up if I don't want to loan......

聚少成多，水滴石破。If you work hard and limit spending and harvest the power of ccompounding, the final amounts are an inevitability as an employee. For an employer who manages costs and earnings well and is market sensitive, the amounts are also achievable in cash. It just looks daunting at the beginning of a career.
 
Some babyboomers have had pension scheme but that is phased out for most. But something has to help current workers last their retirement. The golden question is, what?

Whilst u could be right that an avg couple with hdb flat + 2 cpf could easily hit a million $, unless u monetise the flat; the cpf portion won't be enough to sustain their retirement needs.  
The trouble with the reverse mortgaging of hdb flat is that it does not maximise it's true value though the recent changes to this scheme has somewhat improved it. Hence, Asian couples who feel duty bound to leave something for their children are at a dilemma n I know some who would rather scrimp on their meagre savings than mortgage their homes. A pity as ideally the couple could have a decent retirement income n yet bequeath something for their children.

You should buy an EC instead. 3 bedroom could be about 800K, although you still need to take loan but just less than 400K then stretch it till your 65 years old.
 
Next time when you sell (more than 5 years later), your EC could fetch at least 1 Million liao.
 
Your new 5rm HDB appreciation will not be so much cos too many BTO around liao.

9 in 10 residential property owners to pay less property tax in 2016: IRAS 
 
 
SINGAPORE - 93 per cent of residential property owners will pay less tax in 2016 after the taxman marked down the annual values of their homes.
 
All Housing Board flat owners will pay lower or no property tax next year while eight in 10 private residential property owners will pay lower property tax in 2016, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore said on Monday.
 
This is in contrast to the 2014 review for the 2015 levy when only 25.7 per cent of private homes had their annual values reduced.
 
Among the private homeowners getting their annual values cut this round, more than 80 per cent will see tax savings of between 3 per cent and 20 per cent.
 
Meanwhile, HDB flat owners will enjoy tax savings of 9 per cent to 24 per cent, compared to what they paid in 2015.
 
In addition, all one- and two-room HDB flat owner-occupiers and 28,200 three-room HDB flat owner-occupiers will not have to pay any property tax when the revised annual values take effect from 1 Jan 2016.
 
Letters have been sent to home owners to outline their levies for the coming year.

If purely looking at a basic place to stay and do not want to consider future sales values, HDB is ideal. 
 
If ultimately the family needs or is seriously considering condo lifestyle, then EC is ideal. 
 
Sell also have to consider what to buy unless you have other options available like a parent's house. 
 
To me, in terms of living, all forms of housing are imperfect substitutes for each other.

If stay EC till 60 years old then sell away; buy a small HDB 3 room for retirement. Pay cash and still got money on hand. Good?

It is a moderately safe and stable strategy in my opinion. 
 
But there are some who only want a place for the family to stay and pay up in full and put resources for retirement.
 
In this context, to downgrade after 60 years needs waiting period of 30 months, or to opt for resales, which can also be costly depending on the part of the cycle. 
 
Some other differences are interest amounts, maintenance fees etc. 
 
A qualitative aspect is it is easy to upgrade family but hard to downgrade.

Between BTO and Private Condo ... my logic is simple.
 
Buy HDB first .... can buy condo later .... subject to some HDB terms and conditions
 
Buy Condo first .... cannot buy brand new hbd ..... can buy resale HDB subject to HDB terms and conditions ... one being must sell your condo within 6 months
 
If you ask me ... I would say buy BTO first ... why waste the privilege of being a Singaporean .... Got money later in life can buy whatever private property you want.
 
My regret ... not buying a HDB when I was allowed to ....

Not to stretch too thin but should leverage on the loan.
 
I used to think loan free is best but if manageable loan and with passive income why not?
 
Unless you got other investment arrangements. With the interest rate, leave money in the bank is depreciating your money.

What is affordable housing today?
 
Looks like resale flats is more affordable.
Resale flats in popular location like clementi and boon keng also not cheap lo. 4 room resale pricing also at least 600-700k

Don’t put words in my mouth leh. 
Want cheap how can be mature estate? Sengkang, Punggol, Tengah BTO might have some 4Rm at 250-300K.
 
Mature estate 300K more than 30 years lease 3Rm might still have. 2Rm definitely have.
 
Work outwards to Bukit Panjang to see what one can afford and the minimum size one requires.

Most of the road near mrt always congested la, not only clementi. Paying 700k for mature popular estate is a norm. Unless you buy those old flats in these area, maybe still can find 300-400k but flats at least 35 years and above.

Living in Clementi I'd say roads there are no more crowded than many others in Singapore.
 
Maybe I travel at wrong time of day but I can't remember the last time in jam.
Busy yes but jam no.
 
I hope my view isn't biased because I live there.

BTO is almost always better than condos for 1st property.  Take the generous government subsidies while they last.

Sometimes I think MCF standard is a scam. 
But you never know.
 
What I quoted are real figures. News report about graduate salary are also published.
 
https://www.salary.sg/2018/graduate-employment-survey-2017-published-2018/
 
I also feel unbalanced and insecure about their rates but that’s the way the system works.
 
If bust the ceiling and only consider something new, then go for EC. If bust EC ceiling, go for private.
 
Else go for resales HDB.

Depends on whether you get a good hdb unit. 
 
Those who can get a good unit, example facing the waterway and close to Punggol MRT..... BTO prices were 400k thereabouts but resale prices from 700k upwards. Those not so good units, maybe 350k at BTO but asking about 550k thereabouts. 
 
In percentage terms, it beats the ECs but some people only look at absolute quantum and is not interested in potential 200 to 350k profit for HDB.

I only follow the numbers of my estate. And for my situation.
Anyway i only look at the actual profit (which is minus renovation cost, loan interest, fees etc etc). lol
 
Anyway i'm still ok cos people who bought a resale hdb 7-8 years ago (as opposed to waiting for 3 years + BTO 5 years), will have likely lost $ in the value of their flat in my estate.

Actually 550k for a 4 room at buangkok mrt still consider cheap if you compared that this price maybe can only buy a 3 room in queentown area. Lol.

for private housing, even $5M i no care
the keyword is public housing
what is the purpose of public housing in the first place?
to provide “affordable” housing for the citizen so that they dont have to burn all their savings?

Ppls said no brainer to spend 100k for a car that only last 10 yrs. isnt renting 1 mil for a living quarter that need to be return in 99yrs the same?
 
The only difference between them is one can be sold at higher price during the earlier yrs (go and try to sell at later years with inflation added, eg >60 yrs)” to see whether still profit or not). Lastly, what if one does not intend to sell?

Firstly, there is the assumption that inflation always remain mild. It may not always be so benign, those who lived through 2007-2012 will know. 
 
If one does not intend to sell, one's neighbours will decide for one through enbloc, or one's child will help one sell.
 
Even after 60 years, those who have owned since 60 years ago would not lose a single cent. In fact, he/she would have helped to settle 1-2 generations' housing needs, 30 years almost rent-free. A GDB in 1980 costs only 1 million, and 3Bedroom condos cost well within half a million in the 90s. A housing need is inelastic and unavoidable, unlike a car.
 
Moreover, who can find 60 years old private condos?

If they really relax on the CPF usage on older flats, then there might have higher demand for older flats liao. Now not many people would want to buy a 40 year old and above flat.

Now there will be financing help for the young to consider such flats near their parents. 
 
This plus the increase of 5% deposit may encourage more of them to buy older resale HDBs.

Yup it seems obvious where they are leading people to. Haha. Importantly for developers, they are fighting with the government for market share. Who will win, everyone knows ready. Most important is what implications it will have on the market in the next 2 years

Flat near MRT indeed can fetch higher but also must depend on which MRT station la. Heard flats located near MRT in cck, price doesnt really fetch very high lo.

But must remember the current context where most families are holding 1 property.
 
If market share goes to the resale HDB, where do the displaced HDB dwellers go to live? If they go to buy another resale HDB, where do that second displaced family go to live? 
 
Just to present a more accurate picture.
