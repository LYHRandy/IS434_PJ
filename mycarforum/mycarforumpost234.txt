confirm, 
 

HDB 2.6metres

condo 3.3
 

am staying in govt.

already my ceiling is significantly shorter (i won't die from it i know)

but y wanna make my already "short" ceiling shorter?
 

valid considerations: lower ceiling, lesser air ventilation.
 
 

of cos, 

one can box up, L-box to get the intended effect of no trunking.

i choose the one with minimal reduction to my air-flow.

anyway, when you look for reno on the floor.
 

see if you can break down the working cost and the tiling cost or not..
 

cause most quoted as a package with a limit of say up to $2.00 per square feet ($2.50 if lucky) price limit on the tiles you can chose.

airfryer not bad but capacity is small. Hold max 6 chicken wings mid joint at any one time only. Put more and the wings will not turn out crisp.
 

Washing is ok. After frying and cooling down, just soak the container and mesh in some soapy water. Wait an hour or so and wash. Whatever stuck will easily come off.

I overhauled my EM, size around 160sqm..rewiring, hacking,grilles,doors, windows etc..

reno alone was $63k i tink..  ..dat oso i outsource some work which i find the main con over charging.
 

Furnishing, lighting, electrical appliances etc..i stopped calculating when it hit near 30k.. 
 

1 regret is using laminate on 1st floor, my children always spill water then always got to monitor & wipe, some areas didnt notice, now bit warping, very ugli.

I am a bit strange but when I was looking for my new place, I was shortlisting those with little to no reno.  I told my ID...whatever reno you see...i want them all tear down.  To me...previous owner's reno is another people's dream....I want a fresh beginning for my house.
 

The housing agents see me also headache..cos when they tell me got reno this and that...I will tell them my consideration is how much it will cost me to tear down the reno....lol

Yes, I do.  The valuation is also much higher than normal.  BUT the reno has to withstand the test of time, meaning, it doesnt look aged with current trends.  So choose your design and materials carefully.  My reno for my previous place was done more than a decade ago and when I sold the place last year, it still looks modern and fresh.

And people complain HDB is expensive......
 

I have a small apartment, but include funitures & TV, around 12K (exclude Kitchen & fridge, tiles, toilet. Those are there when I came). Done over 3 months, few at a time. But there are still some work to be done (little things like curtains & canopy for the balcony, & some painting pictures on the wall). I am guessing, at the end, it will be about 16k. 
 

Reno cost: about 1/2 dozen 200ml Beer. My friend help me in transporting & assemble some furnature, fix the lights, & paint the house. 
 
 

I think the profit margin of these contractor must be enormous in Singapore. 
 

I think contractors in SIngapore is abit like dealers in Singapore. They know we pay a huge money for our car/housing, so they charge 'appropiately' high.

By the way do you guys expected a higher selling price for your place if you done considerable reno?
 

I am a bit strange but when I was looking for my new place, I was shortlisting those with little to no reno.  I told my ID...whatever reno you see...i want them all tear down.  To me...previous owner's reno is another people's dream....I want a fresh beginning for my house.
 

The housing agents see me also headache..cos when they tell me got reno this and that...I will tell them my consideration is how much it will cost me to tear down the reno....lol




it may help in COV to some families (especially PRs) who want a nice place that is in move-in condition.
 

to most young families, its TEAR TEAR TEAR. I WANT MY OWN DESIGN!

Yes, I do.  The valuation is also much higher than normal.  BUT the reno has to withstand the test of time, meaning, it doesnt look aged with current trends.  So choose your design and materials carefully.  My reno for my previous place was done more than a decade ago and when I sold the place last year, it still looks modern and fresh.



 

I guess so...I gave a discount to my buyer becos I done no reno for my current place.

Agree.
 

Simplistic, clean, (boring?) design sells better, usually.
 

Because tear down also cheaper, hehe.

you cannot compare renovation cupboard to those off the shelf carboard. 
 

renovation cupboard are consider fabricated on demand so the price will definitely higher as compare to those off the shelf one size fit all type.
 

there are advantages to both as well as disadvantage to both. so its really our own choice of what we want to spend on.

your renovation should have warranty 1 year min right? 1/2 year only how can they charge you..
 

also $80 per area is how big an area?

But actually, I am very particular about how my house look. But my low cost solution is to not concentrate on fit & finish & high end stuff, to make all the interior sync but rather decoration like flowers, pots & soviners placements. I am going for more country style, so there is no need to sync all the funature to same style., which help save the cost.

I loved the country style since I watch the 2006 film, the Holidays starring Kate Winslet & Jude Law.
 

Except for the Kitchen, which need some professional work, most things for me, I do not need tailor fit. In fact Most bed room, you can buy full sets as well, Double bed, cabinet, side desk etc. 
 

The key for country style is in teh decor. 


 

But I know most Singaporeans prefer modern comtempary style & workng on our own housing interior is not Singaprean thingy. Even if you wanted, its very difficult to source the things you need to do it yourself in Singapore. 
 

I also spoke with another friend & he said he rather spend the money than time. 
 

I think, in the end as long as you are happy with the money spend leh.

my feel is to pull off the country look, you need a big(ger) floor area than what most HDB flats have. that's why most choose modern contemporary.
 

for landed property, aah.. different liao. alot of styles to explore.

Marble should cost a bomb I guess. 
 

When I lived, marble is not popular as it can get too cold at night, especially the winter months. I prefer wooden tile, can be very cheap also. Better heat insulation. 
 

I like carpet also, cheap also, warmer, but hard to clean.

Different strokes, different folks ma.
 

My friend bought his first HDB recently. I went and saw it in it's original condition. Horrendous. So incredibly tacky. The previous owner wanted 'beach' theme.
 

Which involved small LED lights on the ceiling (representing stars, I think), navy blue walls and a useless glass table/cupboard thing filled with shells and sand.

And people complain HDB is expensive......
 

I have a small apartment, but include funitures & TV, around 12K (exclude Kitchen & fridge, tiles, toilet. Those are there when I came). Done over 3 months, few at a time. But there are still some work to be done (little things like curtains & canopy for the balcony, & some painting pictures on the wall). I am guessing, at the end, it will be about 16k. 
 

Reno cost: about 1/2 dozen 200ml Beer. My friend help me in transporting & assemble some furnature, fix the lights, & paint the house. 
 
 

I think the profit margin of these contractor must be enormous in Singapore. 
 

I think contractors in SIngapore is abit like dealers in Singapore. They know we pay a huge money for our car/housing, so they charge 'appropiately' high.

Wall and floor. I think it will be slippery too but in actual case, not too bad.

Good thing about marble is, the floor is complete flat. No trap for water. So, less dirt kena trap.

The water also dried up faster.

How much did you spend on your last major house renovation? 



 

about $265k in 2008

about $80k in 2000
 

nowadays, i feel it's all chop carrot.

the price they quote can easily be 30% cheaper anytime.

contractors / some know as interior designers chop until cannot chop.

they make millions of dollars a year.

can buy everything in cash.

Wall and floor. I think it will be slippery too but in actual case, not too bad.

Good thing about marble is, the floor is complete flat. No trap for water. So, less dirt kena trap.

The water also dried up faster.




wah.. you very brave cause i cannot allow a chance that my house got anything dangerous. maybe i am paranoid.

For sure, certain jobs requires professional craftsmanship. But need craftsmen to paint the wall, or mount the lamp meh?




frankly speaking, how much this two thing cost?
 

dont forget mounting a lamp will require the proper tools. getting those tools that can drill well will set you back by easily another $200. getting leader leh. plus this and that. add up the cost of getting electrician to mount the lamp is cheaper.
 

painting wise can save this one i agree. but lamp dont think you will save much after all the investment. (of course if you got friends to borrow those drill is another issue.)
 

but even that, its likely less than 5% of the total renovation cost.

i've heard from friends that contractors earn alot ... 

eg. landed property renovation they can quote 1.5M- 2M but in fact the cost could be around 500K +only.. 
 

they also can co-broke so split the profits 50-50.. make 500K easily.. then they can buy landed / condos themselves..

its basically an empty house and i brought nothing over from my parents' place. so i think its still ok.
 

my direct neighbour opposite my unit, she is an ID. she spent 120k to do up her 4 room flat.. very nicely done and with alot of gadgetry like fingerprint lock, 24/7 CCTV, wine bar etc. if 120k is her cost, i think for customers like us it will cost 160k upwards.

more than 10 yrs ago , for my bachelor pad, i started using quite a lot of industrial clinical styles.

including lights , switches, doors knobs, glass, steel, metal. etc...  

The Japanese and Germans are the best in this 
 

If you watch the movie Tokyo Raiders (tony Leung, ekin cheng) , you can get some great inspiration.

quite a bit of philip starck designs too.

but since quite many years ago, such designs have been heavily used so no longer that unique any more.

When I bought the house last year, the parquet flooring is around 10 yrs old leow. Other than the usual scratches to the varnish, the wood was still in pretty good condition. So I asked the contractor to sand and repolish them. Now they are good as new and is much cheaper than replacing them.

by right it should be cheaper than the fanciful marble flooring plus false ceiling etc.. 
 

cos more industrial look mah.. suppose to be like warehse bit..  
 

designers will appreciate it more..



 

yes, true. but to bring out the uber cool look you gotta use good fittings, like. switches and door knows and details and lighting.
 

i use Jung brush alloy ones. each switch may cost $70-$150

 compared to plastic ones for $15-$30.
 

also stainless steel items and glass are not cheap.
 

therefore what you save for tiles, you spend for good fittings.
 

well, kind of.

Sometimes, to DIY your own stuff isn't about dollars & cent, but the satisfaction of having a hand in your house. 90% of my furniature are self assembled. There is a joy to say build up a bookshelf from catrons boxes shipped in pieces (or salf transport), & seeing it become a full bookself by your own hand, & populated it with decors from all over the places over time. 
 

Its a little bit like polishing your own car. Every shine is your sweat, its just feel better. But I may be the minority.

I feel in Singapore, we are easily chop because we are so reliant on others, or too lazy to work. Few can say this, "Forget it, I do it myself. "
 

For sure, certain jobs requires professional craftsmanship. But need craftsmen to paint the wall, or mount the lamp meh?



 

we don't all have so much leave to do this s--t.

Yeah , i personally like that style.

better suggest her all the /2 ideas
 

cook less per day /2

reuse/reduce water usage /2  (cos water saving taps will be useless if user never conserve water)

try centralise cooking for 2 area "kitchen" /2 (eg 1 area for heavy cooking, another for preparation only)
 

but 1 thing for sure, 2 fridges is a must (for me) 1 is not not enough

i get your point... 
 

my wife and i painted our own house.. besides saving a fair bit.. the satisfaction is much greater even if certain spots are not so well painted..  
 

but during the process, sometimes its really tiring and curse and swear though 
 

but when all is done, and admire your own piece of work.. its brillant..

That's exactly what we do, two kitchens but only one big fridge and one big wine chiller. It doesn't increase electricity or water for us.
 

Fridge and air-con are definitely the two biggest contributor to power consumption, and getting a new energy saving fridge will help, as well as ceiling fans. We got bigger fridge, and smaller electric bill than with the older smaller fridge. No need Grohe, as long as the toilet and shower have water saving features - two biggest contributor to water consumption. Our water consumption is below national average and we have 4 bathrooms, 2 kitchens.

hmmm, in overseas where supermarkets are where they cant go as often, big deep freezers are common for them to store food and keep for very long time. 
 

but in sg, we go supermarkets at least once a week. unless you will be storing alot frozen foods, a deep freezer wont be useful
 

i find the fridges now, inside comes with more compartments and relatively small compared to older days.
 

for me, 1 fridge nearer kitchen store those more perishable foods, fruits ,vege, meat, left overs, and things need to use more often

freezer - all the frozen meats, fish, lup cheong, etc 
 

the other fridge more for dried food stuff, medicine (cough syrup, etc), eggs, candies, chocs, chinese herbs, juices, drinks, and other junk foods

in freezer, ice creams, frozen precooked/quick to prepare food stuff eg pau, tang yuan, prata, frozen timsum, etc  (just my opinion to try not put them together with frozen raw meats) 
 

chum i almost listed out all things in my fridges liao

Rather, mostly the knives here are overpriced. Buy from Japan or U.S. The so-called R&D goes into the reseller's pocket or import costs.

we don't all have so much leave to do this s--t.
 

if i have so much time, u ask me build my own house i oso ok la ...  




Actually Singapore leave not bad liao, by Asia standard. China is far worst. But of course cannot compare to some other places lah. I know I am lucky to have so much leave.  
 

A house will be difficult. I known someone who spend....wait for it 8 years to build his own house. But he had another house to stay so no biggy. My collegue  said his house was done in 9 months, contactors did most of the exterior work, he did mainly the interior. But his neighbour who DIY 100%, took 4 years!
 

Professional work is of course much faster. But you do not have to do 100% of your home to feel personal. Even small things like decors for the living room, an added mini water feature. Even mounting some nice artwork or family photos on the wall.  
 

Its the whole process, the "journey rather than the distination". You saw something you like on a decor mag. You do some measurement on the area to reno, sterch some pictures, go out to source the items, then put together at home. For sure it would not look nicer than maybe if you ask contactor, but I bet you will like it more.
 

For me, the same view on top of a hill is nicer if I climb up from the bottom than driving to the parking lot, & walk 20 metre.

Speaking of leave, if compare to USA i heard we are living in heaven liao.. heard they only have 7 day leave.
 

Anyway back to topic.. I think getting contractor to do the job, it wont be nice. i tried it before. only Interior design do one is nice. 
 

contractor damned stubborn, tell them to do this, they will do that without telling you. end up i have to sack my contractor for my first house.

The LED will save alot of cost, & they can distribute lights better.
 

But I do not understand why you need 12 hours aircon unless its weekend. Normally, you can cut off at 1-2am when you sleep, If you room is well heat insulated, the cool (or warm air depends on your prespective) can be subtain for quite a while.  Your body temp is also a little lower when you sleep, so you do not really need the aircon IMO.

here is what i do. i fill up a 2000cc bottle and leave it inside the water cistern. that way, i reduce the net water flow everytime i flush. functionally, the reduced water flow works just as well. i never monitor the water bills so i have no idea how much cost savings i have gotten. it has been there for 6 years or more i think.

disagree. the nature of LED lighting is such that they offer high intensity with poorer distribution characteristics as compared to fluorescent bulbs. This makes led lighting to be unsuitable for direct lighting. Unless you incoporate LEDs as diffused lighting source or feature the use of highly efficient reflectors, the radiation pattern tends to be unidirectional rather than omni directional.

i wish i had $$ to spend to renovate my house nice nice and live in it comfortably like a king. Most of your interior design pics are all very nice.
 

My current place was renovated with 53k, plus electical appliances + cheap furniture, another 10 perhaps.. 
 

initial budget was 80+k, then after think think, thought of possibility of renting out the place so no point use nice material..i reduced the budget after that.. and true enough, after living for less than 4 months in empty house (my in laws doent wanna shift in with us as they like their old house, my mom doent stay in SG).. i rented out again.. 
 

wonder when can i stop renting out and do a real nice reno to a place call home and stay. I always felt that i am losing $ when i stay in a place myself.. the stupid Robert Kiyosai theory is always lingering in my head all these years.. I think bottom line is my household income not there yet to enjoy life. Really envy you guys..

initial budget was 80+k, then after think think, thought of possibility of renting out the place so no point use nice material..i reduced the budget after that.. and true enough, after living for less than 4 months in empty house (my in laws doent wanna shift in with us as they like their old house, my mom doent stay in SG).. i rented out again.. 
 

wonder when can i stop renting out and do a real nice reno to a place call home and stay. I always felt that i am losing $ when i stay in a place myself.. the stupid Robert Kiyosai theory is always lingering in my head all these years.. I think bottom line is my household income not there yet to enjoy life. Really envy you guys..



 
 

haha, yes stupid Robert kiyosaki.
 

but if you rent out then where you stay?

you rent out only to rent a cheaper one?

wahh.

dude, in life, there are many things that you simply cannot measure with dollars and cents.

The LED will save alot of cost, & they can distribute lights better.
 

But I do not understand why you need 12 hours aircon unless its weekend. Normally, you can cut off at 1-2am when you sleep, If you room is well heat insulated, the cool (or warm air depends on your prespective) can be subtain for quite a while.  Your body temp is also a little lower when you sleep, so you do not really need the aircon IMO.



 
 

actually its a bad habit to on aircon so long.. waste electricity, also need to apply mosturiser if not skin later very dry..
 

unless the flat facing is west.. which can be very hot at night... if not actually use fan cheaper and should be sufficient..

My wife & kids slp early ard 7-8+, so she will turn on aircon...the aircon will be on till the next day ard 7-8 when we all wake up to go work etc. Best part she turn on ceiling fan too.  .middle of nite i sure wake up.  .its like sleeping in freezer..then i will turn off fan & increase temperature of aircon but wife will turn on fan again when she wake up.
 

I dun like tis habit..now kids cannot slp w/o aircon.  good ting is kids slp with us..juz scared when they grow older, slp in their own room & they want aircon also..then siao liao. 



 

Wow, next time they go camping or NS (if boys), jialet liao leh.
 

Your wife is from Alaska, or Finland, or Siberia? On aircon with fan!

disagree. the nature of LED lighting is such that they offer high intensity with poorer distribution characteristics as compared to fluorescent bulbs. This makes led lighting to be unsuitable for direct lighting. Unless you incoporate LEDs as diffused lighting source or feature the use of highly efficient reflectors, the radiation pattern tends to be unidirectional rather than omni directional.



 

Ok, my bad on LED better distribution, but I really means is that you can put many LEDs in a room (for same power consumption), so the lights are welll spaced instead of from a single source.
 

LEDs lighting are gaining popularity in places like kitchen, where traditional single ceiling lights can be block when you are working by the corner kitchen bench. If you work mainly on the island, then no so much issue. So its better to put multiple LED lights (to be fair, traditional lights will do as well, its more about the position than light type) along the bottom of kitchen cabinet. 
 

LED does usually last longer than traditonal flu. or inc. lights but then again, its harder to find replacement also.

Sometimes, to DIY your own stuff isn't about dollars & cent, but the satisfaction of having a hand in your house. 90% of my furniature are self assembled. There is a joy to say build up a bookshelf from catrons boxes shipped in pieces (or salf transport), & seeing it become a full bookself by your own hand, & populated it with decors from all over the places over time. 
 

Its a little bit like polishing your own car. Every shine is your sweat, its just feel better. But I may be the minority.



 
 

yup... 100% agree.... its just like what i did when i was young, make my own "wall mounted table out of wood plank... its hardwork, its not that presentable, but im proud and satisfied to my work... having to say that, its my only piece of 100% self made furniture till now... maybe when im retired, I will do more but not at the now... lol

Beautiful house does not equate to beautiful home..A happy family does..
 

I remember when I was young, my parents cant even afford tiles in the hdb flat, remembered the cement flooring..seriusli tis not for fashion but can't afford tiles. Later, they buy those rubber floor mats, then my dad DIY cut to fit the floor.house sparcely furnished but we happy. 



 

An upvote for you!
 

I had a similar upbringing, back in the day, we had no aircon, just a ceiling fan and the cold, hard floor, but I really enjoyed sleeping on the cold, hard floor, especially in the afternoons!
 

I still do!

Turning on both the aircon and fan is advisable. You cool down a room quicker, and you don't need to set the thermostat at frigid temperatures. With a fan, setting your aircon to 27 degrees is very comfortable for me.

Regardless of Brand...A good Knife is subjective to the individual...

For me, the weight & balance is the most important factor...
 

Some Knives cost more than others because of Steel Grade, but

mostly because of Balance...

hmmm, in overseas where supermarkets are where they cant go as often, big deep freezers are common for them to store food and keep for very long time. 
 

but in sg, we go supermarkets at least once a week. unless you will be storing alot frozen foods, a deep freezer wont be useful
 

i find the fridges now, inside comes with more compartments and relatively small compared to older days.
 

for me, 1 fridge nearer kitchen store those more perishable foods, fruits ,vege, meat, left overs, and things need to use more often

freezer - all the frozen meats, fish, lup cheong, etc 
 

the other fridge more for dried food stuff, medicine (cough syrup, etc), eggs, candies, chocs, chinese herbs, juices, drinks, and other junk foods

in freezer, ice creams, frozen precooked/quick to prepare food stuff eg pau, tang yuan, prata, frozen timsum, etc  (just my opinion to try not put them together with frozen raw meats) 
 

chum i almost listed out all things in my fridges liao  



 

For me, I'm used to buying things by the Bulk, so I save a little here & there (OK, I'm CHEAP)... 
 

I usually buy like 1 whole Salmon, 1 whole Threadfin, 1 rack Ribs, etc...You get the picture...

& later come home to repack them into daily usage, so a freezer works better for me...

That's exactly what we do, two kitchens but only one big fridge and one big wine chiller. It doesn't increase electricity or water for us.
 

Fridge and air-con are definitely the two biggest contributor to power consumption, and getting a new energy saving fridge will help, as well as ceiling fans. We got bigger fridge, and smaller electric bill than with the older smaller fridge. No need Grohe, as long as the toilet and shower have water saving features - two biggest contributor to water consumption. Our water consumption is below national average and we have 4 bathrooms, 2 kitchens.



 

You are right, the new generation fridges are pretty good...
 

Grohe was having a sale the last time at their showroom, so since we were going to do 5 Bathrooms + Powder + 2 Kitchen...

They gave us a pretty good discount & the whole house is uniform...Well at least that's how my wife convinced me...

in singapore , we have no choice but to measure in dollars and cents.
 

but there are just some things which you dont want to do so.

in this case, it's not that you cant afford to live there, you just want to squeeze more.

but when and where does the squeezing stop?
 

it may be a virtue to be a saver and not a spendthrift for sure. but dont end up a miser.

Balance it out a bit, dude.

You sure or not ? Henckel always got two types, Zwilling (two men) and Z.A. Heckel International (one man), both produced by the same company. They are both inexpensive in the U.S. and Europe, but in China and Singapore, the prices are jacked up for whatever reasons, probably due to the brand culture here.

I'm not too sure about the rest of the world, but the last time when I was in Takashimaya, 

I questioned the difference between the Logos & the sales lady immediately pointed out

the differences to me...
 

J. A. Henckels International logo is 1 guy holding a spear. This is the lower end and mostly made in China.
 

Zwilling J. A. Henckels is the one with the "TWIN". This is the higher end and are manufactured in Germany.

There are a few brands, but mine's from Australia, the cheapest ...you can go to any shop in Balestier & they will show you the

By the way too, too much air con for the kids may cause them to be susceptible to frequent colds and coughs as their resistance levels are not mature yet.

that will bring us to the argument on energy savings and breakeven period. LED lights are not exactly cheap if you buy lots of them.

so if i am not wrong, your bor wanted to use big gas stoves for cooking?   Respect! Big flame cook things tend to be tastier cos got "tia bee"   Furthermore outdoor kitchen means less "la sum" on the grease and oil in the house right?

so if i am not wrong, your bor wanted to use big gas stoves for cooking?   Respect! Big flame cook things tend to be tastier cos got "tia bee"   Furthermore outdoor kitchen means less "la sum" on the grease and oil in the house right?  
 

You are right...The High Heat is Best when cooking Chinese food...

REally?
 

There is a Habonos in suntec for more than 10 yrs already. but that one is not the Habanos Habanos , they just use the name Habanos.

got two ladies inside, try to act knowledgeable but all the knowledge from books. Many years ago, i walk in just to buy butane gas for my lighter.

they started talking talking "teaching"me about cigars.  I just smiled and nodded. One of them is a tomboy type and the other always wears a beret.
 

You mean a new cigar retailer coming up near Carrefour?

The real Habanos from spain? 

cool.  this i must see.

ithink its the "habanos" from the otherside of the mall, moving nearer to carrefourarea which has lower rent......  but if it's the real Habanos opening an outlet, that would be realcool.
