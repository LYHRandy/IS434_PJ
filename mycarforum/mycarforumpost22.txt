Your place dun have pamphlets on these items? Becoz of competition especially hdbs they are littered with these advertisements.
 

A lot of the wrought iron gate have hook on hinges. Just get 2 fit men and they can lift the gate out of the hinges. Whatever super padlock you use will be pointless. So pay attention on what hinges will be used for the gate.

Can. Depending on the material used for the joints of the hinges. Actually a lot of them use mild steel for the joints, they are considered soft and not to mention cheap. Robbers can still easily break it by drilling thru the welds and lift up the entire gate. You say cheap perhaps that's the trade off. 
 

Anyway gates are easy to break. The weak points are the hinges. You can request to use stainless steel joints.

contrary to popular thinking..fire door is used to reduce the spread of fire and smoke from your own unit to other units in the event of fire..it simply means you install to prevent damage to other properties

It work both ways.  If there's a fire at the corridor, the door will prevent the fire and smoke from coming in.  The fire seal at the lipping of the door will expand to seal the gap between the door and frame, preventing smoke from coming in.  SCDF respond very fast here. 
 

There's many ratings for timber fire-rated door, from half hour to two hours.

Got pressure means got something inside. Ya, fire extinguisher is annually inspection item. Not annually replace item. 
 

The CO2 cartridge inside is sealed. No way for gas to escape. Once u activate it, a needle will puncture the cartridge to release the gas. No way to refill, only can change cartridge.

Better give proper lesson hor. Do not touch the nozzle when discharging the CO2. Otherwise ur fingers will stuck to the nozzle due to the freezing temp when CO2 is released.

Look for PSB sticker on the hinge area of the door for fire rated, check ur neighbour's door if not sure. Normally 30 y flats have normal doors be it staircase or where ever, 15 yo flats like mine ave fire rated. Installation of fire rated door is no joke, but do not hv to heck floor, they wil sand down the door if needed to fit your door frame. Ask HDB to recommend their contractor is safer cos they have ready stock of PSB approve fire rated doors at lower price.

How are they related besides the word 'fire'?  
 

One has fire-rating, the other does not.  

One can only prevent fire and smoke from coming in, the other put out fire.



 
 

Both prevent a fire from spreading?

Hi Bros. Can anyone can recommend a good contractor to replace the HDB main door & wrought iron gate? I am looking at a single contractor to do both so there will not be an arguement of mismatch.
 
Not sure if Fire Rated door is needed as my unit is not immediately next to stairways. I read some stating it costs around $1600 each

Which area is the flat in?
 
Our area, HDB just told us that there'll be a polling in Jan to decide whether the residents want to support some free upgrading, which will include changing some main drainage pipe in toilet, rubbish chute, and ceiling repair/patching up.
 
There is even an option to pay a subsidised amount to replace the 2 toilets with waterproofing, as well as i think metal gate. The main door was changed more than 10 yr ago to the fire rated ones.
 
You might want to check whether there will be such scheme coming up soon for the area, and if have, might want to wait instead of spending your own $$ to do now.

Definitely opt for the package to replace two toilets and stuffs. Very worth it considering the affordable price.  
Workmanship, tiling and finishing were surprisingly good for us. On par or better than condo. But of course, depends on the actual contractor handling your job.

Thanks Bro Atrecord. Don't think my area is schedule for upgrading yet. I have received reply from HBD that my door, door frame & even door self closing device must be Fire Rated. Door being "half hour" Fire Rated. All must come with PSB label.

As long as the stairs is within a certain distance to your door (think 2m), fire rated is a requirement so that any burning to your house can be delayed to give enough time for people to escape thru the stairs.
 
Ever asked hdb to confirm for my door and guess what,  the guy just simply refuse and asked to refer to guideline and confirm yourself.  He simply refuse to confirm anything in black and white.

i am not sure if fire rated doors is really a HDB requirement anymore.
 
A couple of years ago, my parent's flat did HIP and one of the optional item is to change the wooden front door. I don't think they are fire rated because it costs only $100+ and it is hollow. My parent's flat is just next to the staircase. IIRC, the HDB HIP contractor said that there is no longer a fire rated front door requirement.

while it is still early days before my in law BTO unit arrives, may I know is there a way to buy ala cart style.
 
Buy door and flooring works separtely rather then have a contractor do the full works as some of the items that the contractor carry may not be to the same liking.
 
I am getting a basic unit without the toilet, kitchen walls and flooring.
 
I suppose many find that an easiest route would be to ask HDB equipe with everything

I didn't know HDB got cater to such things ... AFAIK they give you one standard list to "choose" from only ... and the list is very short.
 
as with most things, one supplier will be able to give you a better price than separate suppliers ... like in the case of my sliding windows ... my reno contractor only charge me half of what individual supplier quoted me !
 
reno is big business and you should go around hunting for the bestest PACKAGE ... I asked about 8 contractors when I did my reno previously.

thanks.
 
My to do list right now is glass partition to separate the kitchen as I did not want to have a brick wall.
 
I also wanted to have a better toilet system.
 
I looking at probably marble floor than ceramic tiles.
 
So I selected the bare basic.

touch wood ... but would you want to consider Perspex instead of glass ??
 
you know ... many cases of even tempered glass shattering for no reason ...
 
my 3rm hdb flat also got no wall between living room and kitchen ... but I cook very little so the smell/smoke is still controllable.
 
I initially wanted to do a sliding wall between but gave up the idea as none of the contractors I approached could do what I wanted.

of course can, but you have to manage each of the contractors yourself, which was what we did for our house reno.

My plan is to have glass sliding door for both toilet and kitchen.
 
My Office contractor has installed the tempered glass partition in the pantry area. Maybe its also installed with a Orange thick sticker and hence the multiple trolley bump from the drinks contractor still intact after 4 years.

No one will bother to check. I see many ppl change the shelter door to plastic/wooden ones. Regulation also says cannot change.Shelters in hdb flat is a joke. Lock oneself inside during a bomb raid is akin to stepping into ones own tomb. What is the odd of a hdb flat standing after a bomb raid?
