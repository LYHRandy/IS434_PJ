Many properties have more than doubled since 2008 period.

Even many properties give discount of 50%, at best go back to the 2008 price levels.

No like salary got increase, those who cannot afford will still find the 50% discount expensive and beyond budget.

Like me...50% discount may be tempting....but then use what to pay for the 30years loan? I can't double my income by doing two shifts in a day.

No lah, me just sprinkle a tiny bit of cold water to wake up a bit of the idea. It is important to plan, be ready and be courageous to act when the time comes...
 

Really no point doing hindsight what-if, if-only etc. Let's all drop such habit and concentrate on timing the next wave. Cheers!

Locals always wait & see. Not decisive, wait until tomorrow.
 

There is always another tomorrow & which tomorrow you are referring to?

If I can confirm that this is old news, I shall remove this thread.  Such rumors are misleading to say the least
