looking at the many recent launches for Thailand property.
 
https://www.icompareloan.com/resources/things-need-know-buying-thailand-property/
 
With so many coup and disruptions from external factors. Is it reasonable to expect that it can only go up from here onwards?
 
I notice the condo sizes is clearly smaller that our shoebox apt. Except that it does not have a bomb shelter. And that sort of remove the dead space.
 
There is no property taxes as well and it comes with a guaranteed yield of 6% per annum for 3 years.
 
Seems quite good IF the thai baht rises after the 3 years of guarantee yield.

Never never never buy those Thailand property launches in Singapore,  they are usually marked up by a lot.  Go to Thailand and buy leftover units from developers. Firstly,  you get to rent out immediately and secondly,  it is usually sold at a huge discount compared to launches abroad.

Never buy from local sales launches - it's 101% rip-off....6% guaranteed yield for 3 years is actually a discount from your own money....add the commission given to local sales agent.....u can imagine how much more you are actually paying....the project that you are interested i think is a low rise development and you need to walk 10 minutes to the main road.....and i also dun think you can see the river.....good luck!

The legal documents can be published in English if you want. The title deeds are in Thai, but you can request for English interpretation. Most important thing is for you to get a good law firm to act for you. 
 
Aussie property rental yield sucks and you will have to pay tax. For Thai properties, I never heard of foreigners actually paying tax for the rental income. You can easily get double the rental yield for Thai properties in comparison to Aussie properties.

while that is true, the capital appreciation maybe muted. Because everything hinge on cost of living as well as the economy.
 
If every now and then , there is a coup , or Red and yellow shirt, you probably best to keep the money in your pocket.
 
The take up rate as well as vacancies rate is really worrying. And hence I am rethinking
 
There was an ad in todays paper for a freehold condo in CBD for a 1400 sqft unit going for under  SGD1,000000 or 30,000,000 baht

Depends which part of Thailand you invest,  not every part of Thailand is investable and Bangkok is facing an oversupply. I would steer clear of Bangkok. As for take up rate, you will be amazed that getting 90% occupancy is a piece of cake for the right location (speaking from personal experience). Just spend more time on tripadvisor and see where travelers like to stay and go to in deciding where you should invest in Thailand.

I suppose in order for captial appreciation to appear, the demand side has to be greater than the supply side.
 
The economy of the country and its investment by external also play a part.
 
Hence, it's quite attractive now with the China and Thai govt in the one belt one rail initiative.
 
Then again, we have heard the hype of Integrated casino and all the property prices in that area would boom.

Recently went to view some Thailand properties at a road show in Singapore, afterwhich we contacted agents and viewed properties while in Bangkok itself. Anyway as what most mentioned the mark on the S'pore roadshow is huge, the smaller the unit the higher the markup.
 
The viewings were mainly for fun, we always doubted how easy it is to rent out the units with so many units on the market. Some will push airbnb but again that is not legal and who will manage all this.

To be honest with you, when you enter into the thai market, it is more of rental play rather than cap gain. The supply is just too huge to think of selling for cap gain, unless of course everybody is looking at the area your unit stands. However, with the right property, you are looking at 10% annual rental yield (tax free).

10% is yield is attractive. 
 
Let hope it don't go into capital depreciation then

With rentals going up all the time in Thailand, very hard for pty prices to depreciate. Just check out what the units are renting for in popular locations n you won't find rentals dipping.

I was checking out some Thai property as well. Actually for a 2br condo at Rama Road in BKK, it is considerably lower than in SG. But then if you compare it against some projects, it a bit too high. 
 
Rental yield is kinda subjective. Wonder how to maintain at 10%. I need to research more.

More importantly is the track record and the size of the developer.
 
And hence, there is the research required to know where and who  and the pitfalls.

If you go with big developers like Sansiri, you may end up with a lacklustre rental yield.

I know of a sg guy who speaks Thai and has a property business there. He does SG clients. Many Singaporean buy property in thailand but the issue to consider is who to appoint to manage your property after you buy.

Thanks Titanium and Hosaybo, gotten help from my Brother friend’s Thai Wife. Didn’t use google translate as I was not able to copy and paste from the pics. I think better not to invest property in a country when one don’t understand the language.

Thailand is highly regulated. So not much worries on the property aspect other then the signing of documents as well as the transfer is quite straightforward.

None of my friends who invest in Thai properties made money. 
Too many new condos sprouting up like weeds so there's oversupply and little actual demand. 
 
Also, maintenance for condos in BKK is atrociously non existent. Condos look worn out after just a few years. 
 
Bank interest rate is veh high compared to rental Yields meaning many investor who take loan will be in negative cash flow - can't see why any investor would want to be. 
 
Oversupply almost ensures you'll never sell for the price you want as new buyers have so many new condos to choose from. Why would they want yours? Unless you sell for a steep discount ie loss.
 
Stay away from Thailand. Politics unstable, people buay song gahmen they change just like that, policy oso can change just like that.

I think it would be good if you contact the real estate agent. You may gain a lot of things from them for free.
