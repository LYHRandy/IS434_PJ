heard the daughter owns Thai Express and the son-in-law owns the Hong Kong cafe?
 

i think the most expensive house should be the one that belongs to 1 of the Prince.

Enter the house from this gate (Road A) and exit the house from another gate (Road B).

He bought the front and back houses.

Very nice, i past by tthe house before. I think vacant for many many donkey years.

Most expensive transacted GCB is 3 Leedon Park at $61.4m. http://sg.news.yahoo.com/bungalow-develope...090000-719.html
 

Still, there are definitely much larger plots in even better locations.
 
 
 

Most expensive overall that I know of is $200m for some rich indonesian lady's backyard. That deal was done 5 years ago. Can probably fetch double the price if sold today.
