Two lose HDB flats for renting them to tourists
09/06/2014on mypaper
 

INCREASINGLY POPULAR: Home-rental websites like Airbnb and Roomorama have become more popular. According to Roomorama, it had some 500 listings for Singapore properties last month, an increase of 30 per cent from last year. (PHOTO: INTERNET)
 
CONSIDER this a warning for those thinking about making a quick buck from renting their homes to short-term visitors.
 
Two home owners have lost their flats after the Housing Board found they had let out their units to tourists.
 
Home-rental websites like Airbnb and Roomorama have become more popular here.
 
The founder of Roomorama, Ms Teo Jia En, told The Straits Times last month that the website had some 500 listings for Singapore properties, which is an increase of 30 per cent from last year.
 
A search on travelmob turned up more than 630 local listings, and another portal, Airbnb, has more than 1,000.
 
But these flout HDB and Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) regulations, which state that when a home (HDB or private) is leased out, it must be for at least six months.
 
Though there have been complaints in the past, and the housing authorities have investigated thousands of cases, this is the first time that HDB has revealed it has taken the step of booting out home owners for the infraction.
 
While the agency would not say when it took back the executive flat in the east, and the four-room flat in the west, it did say that its investigations proved the owners had leased out the flats to multiple tourists for between $25 and $75 per night.
 
It also issued a warning to one more flat owner in the central part of Singapore.
 
According to its spokesman, an errant home owner can also face a financial penalty.
 
The HDB investigated 184 cases of short-term leasing in public flats last year. It investigated 106 cases the year before.
 
A spokesman for the URA, which has oversight over private dwellings, said that in the first four months of this year, it investigated 350 cases of "unauthorised use" of private properties.
 
Last year, it investigated 2,100 such cases, which included instances where home owners turned their apartments into dorms for foreign workers.
 
Private homeowners who flout the six-month minimum rule face a maximum fine of $200,000 and a jail term of up to 12 months.
 
Said the URA spokesman: "Some home owners are turning their homes into boarding houses and leasing rooms out for a couple of days to generate quick income from spaces they can spare."
 
But most other home owners do not want to live among transient strangers, the spokesman added.
 
An HDB spokesman said other residents felt the frequent change of occupants would pose security concerns.

no worry, rentor salah, rentee no salah.
 
Think this issue is quite prevalent both for private and HDB flats.
 
It's matter they want to crack it down hard or not.

If I'm not wrong, losing your flat doesn't mean $0.
 
What HDB does is to return a certain amount (probably valuation) back to the owner's CPF.
 
Correct me if I'm wrong .
 
Another problem is overcrowding due to rental. It's amazing when you see almost half a platoon of different faces go in and out of 1 unit all the time

Why orbigood?
 
AirBnB is a great service, really.. Saves travelers money, as well as allow them to meet new people (hosts).. Recently used it when I was traveling Japan, and our host was amazing..
 
While it's against regulations for HDB, in this case, I think the regulations are crap, and hopefully will be changed. Though I have more chance of winning the CNY 10M hong bao than the regulation has a chance of being changed. =S

The owners should rent out permanently to FWs, and earn a steady stream of income.
Why bend the law to rent out to tourists, if you need income?
 
Now, you lose your hdb flat, this is really or-bi-good.
 
Just apply to rent out to FWs, malaysians, etc. Apply to HDB, and you will get approval.
Steady income coming in, and no foul of laws.
Thats what my parents do, after we move out.
A few hundreds dollars income for a room rental out, to supplement my dad's cleaner job. All happy :)

home stay for free?  i guess those people are doing it for money and too often (probably avoid income tax, you know they dun like this!) 
 
but it is a problem if i see strangers going in and out in my neighborhood.

I assume that HDB do not return the valuation amount.. Cos' is like confiscated.. Should be same as crime such as using HDB flat as betting station or casino bah.
 
Same as if one is to use his car to smuggle eg drugs into the SG and ganna caught. .. I dun think custom will return him the car or pay him some $.

I know a number of HDB owners in CDB area has been reconfiguring the bedroom partition in such a way that it can increase from 3 into 6 air-conditioned bedrooms with a much smaller living room, dining if any at all as a compromise just to optimise the rentable area to tourists. Yet they also live in there with their children. Of course, no privacy .... Is this a way to milk more money out of your only assets or liability? Being creative and business minded gives them substantial steady monthly income.. :)

What to do? Many locals especially those hitting 40's have difficulty finding employment with decent sustainable income. That's the only last resort. Am sure most will not want to compromise on their privacy, but when situation calls for, no choice.

I am sure if your neighbours are doing that day in day out, you won't be so liberal.

Chicken coop is worse. In fact my next door neighbour who's hiding from loan sharks have rented out their entire flat to quite a few foreigners already. So far so good. A Pakistani, an Indian from Punjab region and the latest one, a Serbian guy an his girlfriend. The first 2 were okay but this 3rd guy a rather heavy smoker.

I see, that's not too bad for repossessing.
 
I wonder if HDB will sell at the discounted price

Red Eyes is a nationwide pandemic.
 
Also based on the technicality that only HDB owns the flat.  The so called owner is but a lessee.
 
But of course whether today's prices reflects that of a lessee leasing public housing, that is a seperate matter...

the 10% off valuation is the less jialat part. The brutal part is the COV paid....  back then...

AH HA! Now I found out the neighbour is subletting out his whole flat illegally. He has yet to fulfil his MOP and already renting out his flat. Any bro knows the consequences for this? I'm disgusted by this group of tenants indian/blanga FWs who are very rowdy and litter all over the corridor, staircase and lift lobby. They are turning this place into a slum.
 
Am waiting for turn to see MP at MPS, see whether he can help.

Try calling the police for their rowdy behavior?  Send email to HDB but you must have some valid evidence that the real owner is not staying in the unit.

The rowdy issue really need to take it up to see if it is within allowed framework. Littering definitely no, smoking is not illegal.

Confirm and double confirm the owners not staying here and all 3 rooms are taken up. Have not seen these 2 jokers for almost 1.5 years since they run chicken from the loan sharks.

Really hope they pack up and go, once they start drinking I hate to think what they are capable of, that's why I kept harping on the safety issues at the MPS.

Sometimes i feel that pple complained about not getting bto is not because they do not have a place to stay, but because they cannot profit much from it. Got another who wrote in to complained just because he cannot get a bto in bendemeer area and his parents nor in law do not live near there at all. I feel that garment should not give chance to those over 6 months, and carry out routine checks, or reward anomynously those who report on illegal renting out of homes.

otherwise it does not make sense... most cheats, the corrupt and other hard core criminals get 5 figure fines for their offences.
So cant imagine these renters get massive 6 figure ones

it's a vicious cycle ...
 
build less bto - pent up demand and long waiting time ... people complain
build more bto - resale hdb price drop ... people complain
 
bto price is linked to resale
resale hdb is part of asset enhancement
hdb price cannot fall ... else ... all hell break lose
 
so, what to do?
 
maintain bto supply to a level ... to sustain the demand
need to get more PR ... to buy resale hdb
need to get more new citizen ... to take up bto
 
hearsay, we are riding on a tiger ... we need to continue to cheong ...

All because of money...anyway isnt bto oversupply now? Now the complaints have shifted. In the oast its complain no housing. Now its complain i cannot get the place i want. Maybe in future balloting should have a fee tied to the location. Unwanted areas, fee is free...popular places is $5000. If you get it, no refund. Unsuccessful ballot then will refund.

your idea is exactly govt idea

$5k or even $15k does not matter because everyone is paying for the popular location
the cost is transferred to next buyer
otherwise, we would not end up with bishan & toa payoh million dollar hdb!!!

Already baotoed, went to see MP. Boh pian, the tenants they rent out to are very rowdy and inconsiderate.
 
They think the neighbourhood is a slum somewhere in India, hang their clothes (washed and unwashed)  all over the common corridor, even over my plant rack! sit and smoke along the staircase in a group, shout and make merry till 2-3am on weekends . . drinking I suppose.

Already baotoed, went to see MP. Boh pian, the tenants they rent out to are very rowdy and inconsiderate.
 
They think the neighbourhood is a slum somewhere in India, hang their clothes (washed and unwashed)  all over the common corridor, even over my plant rack! sit and smoke along the staircase in a group, shout and make merry till 2-3am on weekends . . drinking I suppose. Don't feel safe having these FWs around. . . .

You did the right thing bro. Stop these pple from making use of hdb and reducing the chance of other citizens who sincerely need to buy a hdb to stay. I saw many cars that have two carpark kabels. One hdb and one condo. No offence but if they want to sublet, obey the rules. I kudos your effort in stopping them.

Some people buy season parking at their in-law's place (which can be either the HDB or the condo) to chauffeur their children in between.

If they have HDB carpark label (assuming it isn't the one for their office) then I think they are already following the rules and staying in the HDB while renting out the condo.
 
Otherwise why would they be paying for the HDB parking? Condo label can be easily explained because it is most likely FOC.

FYI it is perfectly legal to stay in condo and rent out HDB if you fulfill the MOP

But i saw these cars in those condos i visited bro and they are residents at the condos. So why are they still having the hdb labels? Parents place as suggested? But if only chauffeuring, why want to pay per month?  
I do agree that they can legally sublet out their hdb, but not the whole unit right?

Yes, it is possible. 
 
I have know of someone who owns a condo and a HDB. The condo was bought before the new ruling whereby one can only own HDB or private property but not both.
 
The whole unit was legally rented out.

On the condition that the minimum occupancy period has been satisfied, a HDB owner can rent out his/her HDB flat and stay in his/her private property if he/she is a Singaporean. A non-Singaporean owner of a HDB flat is not allowed to rent out his/her HDB unit. 
 
Owning additional private property units is not a problem.

there are a couple of reasons that owners are permitted to rent out the HDB before 5 years MOP 
 
Working overseas, owning a HDB shophouse with lodgings upstairs etc

A few families here got their gates splashed with paint when ah long runner came to harrass them. I would have been only slightly pissed off if he were apologetic when I asked him about the loan shark and what he was going to help with the cleanup. BUT he still damn guai lan and told us neighbours to go fly kite! Knn . . . This bugger!
Never see him for almost a year or 2. Once he came back to collect some stuff but got locked out by one previous ang mo tenant. Police were called in.

Why not? I also buy my in laws place season parking although I only park 2 hrs/ 5 days a week. But who knows sometimes I need to stay longer? Or sometimes my fil borrow my car. Or I oversea. Save the hassle and just buy season lor.

Previously for most estates have to put parking coupons but sometimes can't say for sure how long one might need to stay. That's why some opt to buy season parking. 
 
Now with all the electronic parking in place I think no need season parking. Pay based on time parked.

Short-term home rentals like Airbnb now illegal, government looking at changes
Linette Heng THE NEW PAPER Tuesday, Feb 7, 2017
 
 

Home-sharing business Airbnb, which set up its regional headquarters in Singapore in 2012, has about 7,000 property listings here as of November 2016.
Photo: AFP
 
It is now illegal for private home owners to lease out their properties for short-term accommodation.
 
An existing Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) guideline against any short-term accommodation of less than six months in private residences was incorporated into the Planning Act after an amendment was passed in Parliament yesterday.
 
The current penalties, whereby private home owners who lease their units for less than six months can be fined up to $200,000 and jailed for up to a year, remain unchanged.
 
Over the past year, URA has seen a 60 per cent rise in complaints about breaches of the rule in private residences, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong told Parliament yesterday.
 
But hope is not lost for those who want to rent their properties on popular home-sharing sites such as Airbnb.
 
The URA is studying the option of a new use class for owners of private residences who wish to engage in short-term rentals, said Mr Wong in his closing speech for the Planning (Amendment) Bill.
 
Such properties would need to be approved for that specific purpose, just like service apartments or hotels, he added.
 
Existing residential buildings would require planning permission for the change of use, and this would be subject to a set of guidelines that URA is currently examining.
 
URA is also looking into a possible reduction in the minimum rental time frame of six months.
 
Mr Wong said: "But whatever adjustments we may make to this minimum period, it is clear that residential homes should not be converted to daily rental of rooms or apartments without appropriate controls."
 
Several MPs, including Nee Soon GRC's Lee Bee Wah and Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC's Saktiandi Supaat, asked for clarity on the Government's stand on home-sharing sites, citing concerns by residents over the lack of privacy and security.
 
Ms Lee said: "I have residents complaining to me about tourists on their floor, moving luggage in and out at odd hours of the day, disturbing their rest."
 
In response, Mr Wong said URA will first work with the managing body of the development that has units with online listings, so that the residents are aware of the rules on short-term stay.
 
If short-term rentals persist and cause disamenities for other home owners, URA will have to step in to enforce.
 
Mr Wong emphasised that the Government sees a role for home-sharing platforms to continue operating in Singapore.
 
Head of Research & Consultancy at SLP International Nicholas Mak said it would be difficult to get approval for short-term rentals from a majority of the residents in any existing condominium.
 
"Perhaps landed properties could be the place for short-term arrangements because the externalities, such as any damage to the common areas, would be borne by the individual owner instead of his neighbours."
 
In response to queries from The New Paper, an Airbnb spokesman said it was "disappointing" the discussion has not moved forward, noting that it has been two years since URA's public consultation on home-sharing.
 
"As written, the Bill lacks the vital details that are so important to the thousands of everyday Singaporeans who take pride in sharing their extra space. Nor is it compatible with Singapore's vision to stay ahead in an age of disruption and innovation."

i think not about noise but rather safety, you will never know.
 
Also seeing unfamiliar faces every other day in and out of the lift may worry some residents. I dun mind if they do it in private apartment within CBD downtown area, but not residential estate in suburb.

actually, if you are active in renting out rooms or units, you will see a lot of people are renting their rooms or units for short team accommodation.
for holidays, short stay etc
 
this is getting out of hands and very common.
 
not being xenophobic, the locals understand this ruling very well and adhere to it.

You will be surprised....a family with quite few pieces of luggage (whilst arrving trying to look for the unit number )/ Singaporeans living in an already crammed apartments nowadays ; trying to cram in all the luggage into lift at one go/or a few times and the door keeps closing/opening (banging) in the wee early or morning hours as it wants to close as other people may want to use the lift & door opening with luggage and other users use disrupted.... just one of the issues; Noise could be another factor too as people from countries with large houses may talk loudly and chairs moving here and there suddenly at late night ; Too many shoes left outside the house could be another issue.....some with little kids will be afraid too, to let the kids play around the common areas or passage way with strangers coming in/out.... anything untoward happens.... blame the govt after that, simple
 
I have done AirBnB in HK and took an apt for 1 week for an exhibition and family outing; the owner of the apt told me to tell me to the security guard that we are friends of so n so and not say we are tourists ; and blended in as a local and the owner told me to take the taxi to the car park lift lobby so that it does not look too obvious to the residents (via main entrance)  if i were to enter with luggage and yes I had to move the dining table/chairs out of the way as the apt was so crammed and the rooms are shocking small; so it might have made noise by some dragging (unintentional )       
 
 
it may not be so bad in landed properties though, maybe. I have stayed in them in Europe/ US /Norway ...  but then once I got fined because i parked on public road on a certain timing of the week which the road cleaning machine comes and they have the power to issue fines/summons  .... appealed to the Authority... no use one.... kenna Euro100/- , had to pay that to the car rental company if not more worse kenna extra processing fees as they have Credit Card details ;

when i was going through the list of airbnb in HK, most of the requirement is keep noise level as low as possible and do not stay in the lobby or outside the unit for too long. I guess airbnb is still not legal in many asian country.

Yes they did mention that in the so called "Contract" too ; What suprised me that the owner of the so called condo was a girl (whom I would say no more than 30 years old) and got such a 1000 sq ft high rise apt in the Tsim Sha Tsui ( it had 3 bedrooms) and was cramped like anything; Only good thing of apt vs hotel was that it had a kitchen

i believe many of these apartment are for investment purpose, not really sharing a 'home'.
 
the one i booked for my kid was actually shared with an expat working in HK, he will rent out the whole unit when the group is more than 2. If only a couple he will rent out one room and he will also stay in.

Most of these over crowding is due to workers holding work permit. I wonder why citizen has to ensure they update their address in the NRIC whilst MOM who issue work permits do not require address to be registered?
 
By simply sorting address you know how many people are staying in a single address.  Also carrying spot checks will enable them to determine is address given is fake.

I think MOM requires employers to update their work permit workers address in the MOM portal now. But whether will employers comply and would MOM check if the address updated  is real then i dont know liao.

I am sure they collect fees for each employee permit. Surely they should do work and be responsible for allowing access. Only know how to collect money har

Actually, most HDB already have Police CCTV to catch Ah Long. I just shudder to think that no one bothers to have a scan ability to pick up such anomalies.
 
The worst part is there has always been an emphasis on Homeland security.
 
The slogan of "not IF but WHEN "it strikes obviously have not caught on for those that live and breath in this space.

Short-term home sharing remains illegal in Singapore; Airbnb disappointed
By NEO RONG WEI
TODAY 
 
SINGAPORE — Short-term rentals offered by platforms such as Airbnb will remain illegal in Singapore, the authorities announced on Wednesday (May 8) after nearly four years of discussions.
 
A minimum stay of three months will continue to apply to private residential properties.
 
Citing an “impasse” on the proposed rules between the poisition of home-sharing platform operators and concerns raised by 1,039 private homeowners surveyed by the authorities, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) said it will not proceed with the regulations.
 
Among the proposals made by the URA last year: A requirement for 80 per cent of owners to consent to short-term rentals in a condominium development, and an annual cap of 90 days for a unit to be used for short-term accommodation.
 
The URA said it is open to reviewing its position, “if and when platform operators demonstrate that they are prepared to adhere to the regulatory framework”.
 
THE SURVEY
 
Producing results of the survey of private homeowners conducted from August to November last year, the URA said the majority felt short-term rentals would have a negative impact on other residents.
 
Nearly seven in 10 felt short-term rentals would raise security concerns in their estate (68 per cent) and result in loss of privacy (67 per cent) for residents
 
More than six in 10 felt short-term occupants could misbehave and cause noise and other disturbances
 
More than half (56 per cent) felt such occupants may damage common facilities
 
About seven in 10 (69 per cent) supported the 80-per-cent threshold for consent in a strata-titled development, and the 90-day annual cap on short-term stays
 
Those surveyed recognised that short-term rentals could provide an income supplement, but only 7 per cent said they intended to let out their homes should short-term rentals be allowed.
 
WHAT AIRBNB, HOMEAWAY AND ANALYSTS SAID
 
Home-sharing platform operators said they would continue to work with the Government, but analysts said the URA’s announcement was no surprise and would provide a fillip to hotels.
 
“The decision is rather unsurprising although it took several years for the government to come to such a decision,” said Ms Christine Li, head of research for Singapore and South-east Asia at real estate services company Cushman and Wakefield.
 
Calling it a “sensible move” to safeguard the interest of residents in private properties, she said their concerns are genuine and arise from the fact that Singapore is one of the most densely populated countries in the world.
 
The Government is not taking the matter lightly, “especially when the beneficiaries of short-term accommodation would be mainly the property investors”.
 
The decision will help to support demand for mid-tier and economy hotels from leisure travellers, said Ms Li.
 
Together with limited growth expected in the supply of hotel rooms in the next few years, it will prop up hotel occupancy and room rates, barring any shock to the global economy, she said.
 
Ms Mich Goh, Airbnb’s head of public policy for South-east Asia, said: “After nearly four years of consultation, it is disappointing that the discussion has not moved forward.”
 
The platform operator remains committed to working with the Government towards a way forward for its community of hosts in Singapore and guests who use Airbnb, she said.
 
In recent years, various governments have allowed short-term rentals and “by sticking with the status quo, Singapore remains the exception”, said Ms Goh.
 
Airbnb said it has tools that help hosts comply with local laws and that it is willing to work with the Government to use or modify the tools to support home-sharing in Singapore.
 
Another operator, HomeAway, said the URA’s decision shows it recognises the complexity of the issue and needs more time to study it.
 
HomeAway stands ready to partner with the Singapore Government to create a sustainable framework that “does not penalise bona fide operators like ourselves and present high barriers to entry that risks driving the industry underground”, said Mr Ang Choo Pin, its senior director of government and corporate affairs in Asia.
 
HomeAway is a representative director for the newly established Japan Association of Vacation Rental, he said.
 
HomeAway has helped lead discussions with the Japanese regulator, culminating in a viable framework to legalise short-term rentals last June, he added.
 
In its statement, the URA said several platform operators felt the proposed rules were overly restrictive and wanted a “lighter touch approach”.
 
“It is understandable that the platform operators would be driven by their commercial imperatives. But it is not tenable for URA to allow a more relaxed regulatory framework that does not address the concerns raised by Singaporeans,” it said.

Saying no is also a form of cooling measure to stop the prices from further escalating. Imagine what your monthly return will be compare to normal renting and you know what is going to happen to the property price.

Depends on quality of tourists and the owner, it could be a nuisance. Some owner really heck care, one unit split into don't know how many small rooms like Hotel 81. But then again, it's the same issue with some long term rentals also.
