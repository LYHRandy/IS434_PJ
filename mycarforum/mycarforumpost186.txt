Power!  





Singapore's skyline is set to welcome its tallest building in 2016 at a site above Tanjong Pagar MRT station.
 

SINGAPORE: Singapore's skyline is set to welcome its tallest building in 2016 at a site above Tanjong Pagar MRT station.
 

Developer GuocoLand said the 67-storey office-cum-residential tower will form part of the upcoming integrated development called the Tanjong Pagar Centre.


 

At 290 metres high, the building will soar above Republic Plaza, One Raffles Place and UOB Plaza One, which are 280 metres tall each.
 
 
 

The Tanjong Pagar Centre will feature TP180 - Singapore's tallest condominium that starts from 180 metres or 50 residential storeys above ground.


 

GuocoLand said this unique feature should appeal to international investors.


 

Group managing director of GuocoLand, Trina Loh said: "We are looking at the investment market, the international market. The product is very important. The product has to be unique in Tanjong Pagar. 


 

"I mean the way we have gone about it, is really - the residential block is above the office. In fact, there are no buildings - residential buildings where it starts 180 metres above ground.


 

"We are very confident our product and the residential component starting at above 180 metres which is really above 50 storeys for residential should command a premium price compared to the area."


 

Currently, a private condominium in the area is going for about S$2,000 per square foot.


 

GuocoLand is looking to put up TP180 for sale in the second half of the year depending on market conditions.


 

TP180 will have some 200 residential units of 1 to 4-bedroom apartments, and 38-storey Grade A Offices - making up 60 per cent of space in the mixed development.
 

GuocoLand said it has yet to confirm an anchor tenant.


 

Research head at Chesterton Suntec, Colin Tan said: "Most of the demand comes from the financial institutions. And I think at the moment, we may not see the light at the end of the tunnel yet. Demand is very uncertain, and because of that, rents may steadily come down."


 

Besides residences and office space, Tanjong Pagar Centre spanning 1.7 million square of floor space will also feature six levels of retail and F&B space linked to the underground Tanjong Pagar MRT station.


 

A luxury business hotel will also be built next to the main tower housing the residences and office space.

I thought there was a height restriction of 280m for CBD areas due to the flight path to Paya Lebar Airbase. Didn't know now can be increased to 290m

I've always thought that the existing tallest 3 buildings @ 280m is something got to do with feng shui.
 

Then again, since going to build a tallest building, why exceed by 10m only.  
 

But I'm impressed that they only need 3yrs to complete this skyscraper

One would expect a better name if one is paying at least 3k psf.  :D
 

But anyway, the developers are never good in naming to begin with.
 

Look at the condos, always XXX regency, XXX heights, XXX cove, XXX green, XXX gardens, XXX lodge etc
 

In the 90s it was french/italian inspired - La XXX, D' XXXX etc Then in recent years, they got lazier and just name it after the building number -  One Amber, One Shenton, Three Three Robin, Martin No 38 etc

Their lowest floor is oredi higher than most top floors. If Tiong bahru can potentially sell at $2000psf, this will easily fetch $3000psf and won't be surprised if that's for the 4-bedders. The 1 bedders may hit $3300-$3500psf.  Suddenly, The Sail looks cheap sia.

Tanjong Pagar is quickly becoming a popular and vibrant destination for swanky boutique hotels, creative office spaces and award-winning celebrity restaurants, according to Savills Singapore.
 

With many new residential projects such as Eon Shenton and Pinnacle@Duxton, the area is expected to overtake Ann Siang Hill and Club Street as a hotspot. Moreover, the nearby port is expected to relocate by 2026 and will be replaced by low-rise, sea fronting homes.

“The main attraction for Tanjong Pagar is its quaint conservation shophouses juxtaposed with modern skyscrapers. It is this meld of contrasts that draws the crowd in - a playground that serves their needs day and night, whether at work, play or even at home,” noted Sulian Tan-Wijaya, Senior Director, Lifestyle and Retail at Savills.
 

The firm was recently appointed to market three adjacent shophouses built in the 1920s. Located at 1A Keong Saik Road, they are near Chinatown, Harbourfront, Clarke Quay and Outram Park MRT stations, and were previously owned by AIA Singapore to house part of its Singapore-based operations till the end of last year.



 

Nice until all the creative houses getting kicked out with the sooper high rentals...

It's only 10M extra, and from the top look down, everything looks damn small..... During heavy thunder storm, might even feel the building shake...

At least Tanjong Pagar Centre is a local name.
 

I never thought that French inspired names were very appropriate for singapore condos.
 

So wannabe, ang moh tua kee. Worse is taxi drivers dunno what the hell you are talking about when you use the correct French pronunciation.
