You live HDB? If it is a condo, don't bother.
 
Their price doesn't include installation (but the same price includes installation for HDB   ).

I have an electric dryer at home and its only useful during the wet season. Most of the time its just sitting on top of the washer collecting dust.

Check it out! Tampines St 23... No piped in gas for the block... No choice... Have to order gas tank.
 
and I don't feel special ... coz end up cannot get free gas machinery ...

Strange is it, considering that public housing should have basic facilities provided like pipe gas which is more efficient and safer than bottled gas being carried all over the place.
 
Gas is cheaper than electricity? If true then why not provide public housing tenants with cheaper alternatives.

u happen to know which is more economical gas vs electric dryer?I have not used an electric dryer before, so couldn’t compare the efficiency. I believe gas dryers run hotter than electric ones, resulting in shorter drying cycles n lesser energy consumption.  
Been using the Rinnai gas dryer for many years. Each drying cycle is normally 40-50mins (depending on the load). My monthly gas bill is between $15-18, which is mainly for the dryer (thrice per week) and boiling water. 
 
Not sure whether this is more economical than electric dryer.
