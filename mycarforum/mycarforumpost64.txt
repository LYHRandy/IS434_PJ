Was planning to get a 5-room BTO this year as my current flat will MOP soon. Was thinking that the new income ceiling came in just nice... until my boss just suddenly gave a pay increment which puts my wife and me just a couple of hundred of dollars over the salary ceiling for BTO. Can I still appeal and has anyone in my circumstances successfully appealed to HDB before?

You can try this route.
1) Get a letter from your MP
2) Submit appeal to HDB via their regular support channel.

Why go through all the hassle writing to HDB, MP, blar blar?
 
Just have a talk with your HR or boss to postpone your increment. Unless your definition of nearing MOP is 12 months down the road.
 
On a more sane note, you can write in to HDB to appeal.

It's quite a lot of $ difference.
My BIL bought a EC in woodlands, that's like high 700k.

Well it worked for me. I think no harm to try. Our reason was that all our parents were retirees and housewives. So we had to support them

Taking consideration of high family commitment and MP letter, that will help in the appeal to HDB.
During the time when I made the appeal, HBD might be well aware of the incoming rule change on the income ceiling.
Hence they allowed me to apply for the HDB BTO then.
 
Also considering the new CPF contribution ceiling raise to 6K, much of your new pay increment is not going into your wallet or OA to fund the house...
Do also consider the monthly maintenance fee (cash).
 
Btw HDB resales levy applies for both EC (launched after 9 Dec 2013) and BTO, depending on the type of your first flat.
http://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/selling-a-flat/additional-information
http://www.phs.sg/list-of-ec-without-resale-levy/
 
Then again, this might be the last time you can get a EC from HDB.
That's my understanding as you have gotten 2 HDB and with grants.
Hence do consider well.
 
 
Cheers.

Thanks for the info. Yup, even with the pay incremement, my take home pay has actually dropped due to the new CPF contribution ceiling. While our income sound high, my wife and I are giving allowances to our parents too. Of course, I believe that savings are important and hence, I'll rather spend less on monthly installments and have some savings to tide over rainy days. 
Have gone to a few EC projects to take a look. Currently, they are not really offering much discounts. Some ECs like Bellewoods are not doing well... less than 40% sold so far. Woodlands resale executive flats are asking for high price....but they are in my options as well.

5~6 years ago, my friend appeal and went through. That was when the ceiling was 8k. He was like a couple of hundred over the ceiling and gave them his monthly expenses saying no $$ to buy EC blah blah blah. I believe he tried more than once. My guess is it might work if you are slightly over. Anything more might not be possible. Honestly, a couple of hundred more per month is not going to change your lifestyle. I hope HDB can be more flexible on this.

Jumbo in woodlands is huge in numbers. The ones that are pricy are the ones that are huge, 170+ to 192 sqm. The executives are more reasonably priced compared to the other estate. 
 
For ec, gotta look at the ones that fall under the old rule which has no resale levy. Else,no point.

Straight away get EC.
If you change your job or get another pay rise, you could missed out EC.
Then your future option will only be re-sale or private.
 
If dual income and both hold middle management post, high chance exceed ceiling for EC.

BTO is meant for the lower-end (60-70%) of the income earners.
 
Let's say your friend earns $200k. HDB uses 70% of that due to variable-income, so it is $140k, or $11,667/mth. Like that still want to fight with people who earn $2,000/mth?
 
But if it is now, the income ceiling is $12,000/mth, so there is no need to appeal.

My case is quite different. I remember mine was slightly under the ceiling. So when choosing the apartment. so we asked the agent if we can secure both the flat and  hle if the income exceeds the ceiling 4 years down the road. We were told there will be no issue since the eligibility is locked down when choosing the flat and not when collecting the keys. 
4 yrs later we were way over the ceiling but had no problem collecting the keys even though we were asked to submit the latest income statement. Maybe your colleagues case is abit too extreme but for most people, this shouldn't be a concern.

If I'm not wrong. The ceiling only applies for new estates. I have relative and Friend who applied for 3 room in mature estates got their flats. I don't think their income is less than 5k and their 3 room is like 4~500k.

I don't understand the ceiling cap for buying BTO. As long as BTO is for you to stay, why ceiling cap? 
 
We have enough land to build for all to stay in BTO if you want to stay. Just make a point that BTO cannot be sold to non citizen or rental. At the price ou are paying, you are already financing the construction cost plus interest.

very good point. if the motto and noble intention of bto is to give sporean a roof over their head
why deprive sporean family who earn above the ceiling to get a bto as long as there are rules to prevent the buyer to exploit
the problem now is bto is a product for speculation and investment
that's why come up with this lame excuse ... if you earn high enough ... go speculate and flip private property
bto ... 1 family 1 unit, mop 10 years, 1st bto = no tax, buy 2nd bto kena tax, etc
why not?

It used to be the case that HDB cannot sublet the whole unit, only rooms back in the old days (90s). Number of rental was also low. Think the rule was changed eventually as the number of foreigners allowed to work here increases. These people need a rooftop and condo is out of reach. I believe it is MBT era which he believed in having HDB as an asset to make money. That changes the whole ball game. To change the rule back to the old scheme is not going to be as easy as said as the implications are high and many are affected. Many of the PRs that is here are also not in the high earning cat (5-6k) region.

This is the reason why so many people must get bto in Bidadari. Cause they have confidence that their flat will be the same as pinnacle and boon keng that 5 years later they can sell at least 1 million.

Hi all
 
I would like to check if you guys know how the process goes if you have exceeded $12,000 ceiling, but you wish to appeal.
 
We are looking to purchase a SOBF flat in a BTO/SOBF exercise, but the HDB portal does not even allow one to proceed with submitting an application if you accurately put in income details that have exceeded the ceiling.
 
Does this mean that we should appeal to HDB immediately after submitting the online application (with a reduced income figure)? Otherwise, we cannot even participate in the exercise which typically ends in 7 days. 
 
Thanks.

there is a reason for setting $12k, if both are fresh graduate and assume both hit combine $12k after working for 3 yrs. then they are in very good position to buy private cos they have 40 yrs ahead.
 
if both are already in mid 30s then mean both have enough saving in cpf (or/and other saving) to put for down for private and take little loan.

The system to determine a lifetime of commitment using a yardstick at a point in time is imperfect. Designed to lock in the duo workforce of a couple over their useful working life.That's how the policy makers have been doing things

Frankly 12k combined income isn't very high  nowadays. 
 
Barely middle income. Only 6k each. Fresh grad can get that amt within 5-6yrs of working
Hmm there are ways but do we really need to go into details as how to beat the income ceiling?  
Converting one monthly income into variable bonus. Either husband or wife quit jib for a year. Convert your permanent vocation into consultant Base. There are many ways to go about it only one need to work out the sum to determine whether economically worthwhile. 
 
Me office boy..seem many around me adopted such approach. Hahaha

Now, a lot of "manager" post also cannot pay $5K.
 
That's why I never look for such job now; concentrate more on "specialist" role.

Income ceiling is reverse discrimination against a citizen.
Direct discrimination, bro.
 
To me, its against our birthright as a citizen of Singapore.

unfortunately, nope!
 
I am referring to those middle/line managerial roles in SME/MNCs. You can argue these are not "real" or "second class" managers, but they are still supervisory/line manager with staff reporting directly to them. Just google Jobstreet/Jobsbank/all the job sites, it starts from 4K onwards niah. Some even have the audacity to put 2.8K and they are people managerial role as per JD.
 
For 4-5K as a manager with reports, jin bohua one... unless you are still young with potential for upward mobility.
 
Once you are 40's, getting nowhere or trying to get back to workforce, it's almost impossible. Better aim at those specialist role.
