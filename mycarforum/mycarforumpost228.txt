tink developer bo pian as competition at punggol too high liao and they prob read the buyer profile/aspiration quite well.
 

but i wouldn't predict any imminent slowdown. prices will moderate but i dun tink it'll fall off the cliff as many are hoping. when that happens, tink we have much bigger sh*t to worry abt.

Chey, it's lucky draw. Not an outright giving out. So the slowdown is not hear yet. 

I still remember back in 2004 when I was shopping for a place, there was this condo called Moonstone Residences, already TOP but only a handful units occupied. Developer was giving out a Nissan Sunny if you buy a unit.
 

Just sharing...

Most of these win-a-car lucky draw only gives you the car. COE, road tax and insurance not included.

COE not included?



 

Most likely not included. 
 

If no money to pay for the COE, then how? Can bank loan be taken for COE? Doesn't sounds like a very good idea to win the car. Just give outright discount on the selling price will be better.

Yes and no. 

As long as cheap credit available, don't expect much downside to property prices.

Actually should give out free cars per unit. Only $100,000 for a normal Jap. Can easily work into the total cost of the condo pricing.

It will be fun to have the entire condo carpark having all same model cars!!

yup. It all depends on the interest rates. I wonder if the government can do something about the interest rates. 
 

Tax 0.2%/year from all oustanding housing loans via income tax?? The quantum should be small as not to kill anyone but the scare itself should correct the property market?
