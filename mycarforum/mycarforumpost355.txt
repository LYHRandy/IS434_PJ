About 10 years ago, together with my dad and mum, I bought a 5 room HDB flat.
My wife was not in the picture during that time of purchase.  At the beginning, I serviced the housing loan with my cpf.  A few years ago, I went back to school to pursue my full-time postgraduate degree. After a while my cpf was completely depleted (as I was on a scholarship and there was no income).  There was a period of time when we had to pay the housing instalments by hard cash.  We are now still paying by hard cash.
 
Upon graduation, I managed to accumulate some cpfs again, but I was looking at the possibility of buying a house with my wife (maybe a few years later) using my newly accumulated cpfs.  I heard that the law has now changed and I could not use cpf to buy a house anymore.  Instead. I have to borrow money from the three banks.  
 
Since I could not make use of my newly accumulated cpfs to pay for my next house with my wife, I am thinking of using all my cpfs to service my current flat with my parents.
 
Comments anyone?  Thanks.

There are 3 names in the list.
In sequence (1) mother (2)myself (3) my father.
 
Does it make a difference, in terms of sequence?
 
My mum was worried that in case if she pass away early, my father could not make good decision in money matters, that was why I was chosen as the second owner in the list.

I just bought a second property and I used CPF.  I think the rule is that as long as you have the minimum sum in your SA/OA, you can use the excess funds to pay for a second property.
 
What I did was to make an e-appointment on the net with CPF board, went to the CPF building and asked all my questions to the CPF officer, including how much of a lump sum I can withdraw for the downpayment and how much I can use monthly for the mortgage.  I suggest you can do that too.

I intend to buy new house with my wife afew years later (not now).
I can arrange to pull out my name from my current flat, if there is a need to (later).
 
I am more concerned with, can I use cpf to pay for next house or must I borrow money from bank (is there a new rule?).  
 
If that were the case, as my cpf has no major use and there is no need to accumulate, I might as well use it to pay my current instalments.

first of all.. as long as you are listed as a owner of your 5rm flat. you cannot own another hdb. 
 
So in order to buy another flat, you need to settle the amt you have already paid out for your parents flat form CPF. CPF requires the other owners , i.e. your mother and your father to "buy" over your share,i.e. deposit the amt back into your cpf before removing your name from ownership. Else, you need to ask for CPF/HDB to give your special exemption, i heard it's quite tough and time-comsuming to do get. Not easy.
 
After you settle with CPF, then according to hdb rules, you can buy another flat that is bigger.. and gt hdb loan, if the flat is smaller, you cant. but you still can use your cpf for your next house.. :( what make you think cannot huh?

you better get all these things settle before you start looking for a place.
 
the easier option is to buy a condo. Then you can do what you want and pay using CPF. But you need cannot take hdb loan lah.

freestylers : i wonder how some couple can buy those new flat in central. 8k topz means, you can only afford a loan of abt 300k to be paid entirely by cpf. Those new 5-rm are priced at 400k by hdb. So weird, they shld review the ceiling soon.

you can loan from hdb or loan from bank.. you can pay using your cpf. :P no one stopping you. :P just note that when you buy a hdb and hdb loan, the entire amt can be deduct frm cpf. For bank loan, depends on the agreement lor.. if they dont do full loan for you, then you need to pay a portion by cash lor ...
 
 
hee hee.. anyway.. old ppl will get very confused... i also very confused when i first bought my flat.. i tot .. i get grant on top of new flat.. later than found out dun have *sigh*

The cpf laws keep on changing. 
I trust the MCF's opinion more than the FAQ from HDB.   
 
Thanks.

1st- your current flat which u paid with ur parents.  
 

You r not allowed to purchase another HDB flat. You have to withdraw your name and place any outstanding under bank loans.  This frees up ur CPF 

which you may not use to pay for your new flat. 
 

But becos you have ur name in the 1st flat. you loses any entitlement for a new flat "subsidy" but ur wife will be able to get her entitlement. 
 

If you intend to buy this flat, all ur CPF $$ will be used but you may be able to loan from CPF. qn I not sure of, best u ask HDB directly.

i believe you are still able to buy a resale flat if both income exceed $8k, correct me if i am wrong.
 
if you get another flat and give up your ownership of the 5-room, and you parent do not have enough cpf to cover the loan (unless you top up for them every month  ), i think it is a problem for you to withdraw. Are you prepare to service 2 loans?

One solution would be, when my single sister turned 35 (soon), she could buy a 3 room hdb flat herself.  Both my parents will stay with her at that time.  I will probably go to US for the time-being.
 
The whole 5 room flat will be rented out.
 
Hopefully upon my return afew years later, I could buy a small condo while the 5-room flat could still be rented out (and let the rental collected self-finance itself).
 
That will solve the problem.

I have the same problem as you. Jrage's answer is correct. See my further comments below:
 
 
Our combined income is > $8k.  Is there any other alternatives I can have?
If you combined income > S$8k, you cannot buy a flat direct from HDB, i.e. you have to buy a resale flat from the market and get a bank loan.
 
 
You mentioned about "loan from hdb".  Are you referring to payment using cpf?
"Loan from HDB" means HDB lends you money, and you are subject to terms & conditions of HDB loan + 2.6% preferential rate. "Loan from bank" means bank lends you money - at their own interest rate and at their terms & conditions. Both HDB and banks allow you to pay using CPF.
However, with your income > $8K, you can neither buy direct from HDB nor get a HDB loan. You can only buy a resale flat from market and get a bank loan. But from what I said before, you can still pay a bank loan using your CPF. 
 
 
So in order to buy another flat, you need to settle the amt you have already paid out for your parents flat form CPF. CPF requires the other owners , i.e. your mother and your father to "buy" over your share,i.e. deposit the amt back into your cpf before removing your name from ownership.
This is the most difficult part. If your parents do not have enough CPF/cash to "buy" over your shares, you may need to fork out cash from your own pocket to pay into your own CPF. This is an alternative if your parents can't "pay" you. But you need to have lots of $$. 
 
 
the easier option is to buy a condo. Then you can do what you want and pay using CPF. But you need cannot take hdb loan lah.
This is what I did. It allows my parents to continue staying in the same house without having to buy over my share. And I can use my CPF to pay the condo. 
 
Hope the above is useful to you!

Thanks C3P0. 
You cleared most of my doubts.
 
I know I can always rely on MCF for a model answer! 
Go to Watefak's profileWatefak2 posts
just want to add that you will need to pay a 5% of the valuation price in cash if you are taking bank loan. As for your sis,she is not restricted to only 3 rm but any model up to 5 rm for HDB loan.Exec can buy but only bank loan.Also her income should not exceed 3K for HDB loan.

Actually, I don't think so. The criteria of combined income <8K is to be eligible for CPF/HDB loan (ie, interest rate pegged at 0.1% more than prevailing CPF rate)
 
Albeniz:
If you are considering a resale flat, why don't you get in touch with a housing agent who can advice you on all questions and concerns as they should be very much in touch with all the policies and changes.

aiya.. if you have a sister .. then things will be easier lor :)
 
you just ask that your sister name to be put in , in replace of your name. And she use her cpf to pay you back..Change the ownership of the hdb from joint-ownership to %. And Ask your mother to write her share to you.
 
 
Scoots /Albeniz: if >8k income can buy, but cannot take hdb loan only. 
 
Freestylers09 : Sorry for the confusion.. ha ha .. i dun know how to explain this..
 
If you buy a flat of value ~ 400k, after 10~20% initial payment, you need to take a loan ard 350k. Over 30 yrs, you need to pay ard 1.4k mthly. if you are taking hdb loan, and the int. is super low at 2.6%.
 
If your combined income is <8k, means that your mthly contribution to ordinary acct is
 <$1.8k@ age b/f 35,<$1.65k @age 35-45 and <$1.5k@ age 45-55..
 
You bearly have anything left every mth...** you need to be very sure that you dun kena retrench within these 30 yrs **

There is no first timer grant or near parents grant for direct application to HDB lah.
These grants are only for resale flats.
