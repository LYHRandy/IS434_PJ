those living in such flats are supposed to be the lower income group. but their carparks are fiiled with altis, sunny, civic, latio and even an occassional mercs/bmw. hard to find a lot at 8pm on a normal weekday. cars must have been so cheap that even those living in such flats can afford it.

there are people who buy tiny pigeon hole condos at high price. for those who have the $$ but see no point in paying for nice compound, can get resale 3-rm for fraction of the cost and spend a few tens of thousands to reno until even nicer than condo.
 

different strokes for different folks lah. don't assume everyone in 3-rm bought it direct from HDB and thus has combined household income below 3k.

the 3k income is the basic criteria for a 3 room flat. i guess times have really changed. the poor are no longer living in 3 rooms. the real poor are those who live in bigger flats, own a car, and struggle to pay the housing and car loan every month.

just a question. If their household combine is NOT under 3k, then how do they manage to buy direct?
 

I also want to know. My pay is high, but I want a 3 room also so that I can stay there and rent out my condo.

Car is symbol of status, 3rm flat is NOT.
 

You can show to everyone you are successful with your flashy, fast and loud car, 
 

but you can't do that with your houses (even it is at district 9 or 10).

I normally seen more "high class " cars in 4,5 or executive room flats....
 

Nowadays, the car park lots are all filled with cars but generally Korean or Jap make.
 

Cars are essential transport mode thus many own one. 
 

Even the so called poor has the ability to own an OPC....So i don't think its an issue for cars.
 

Its either people want or don't want buy. Not people too poor or etc.....

1) The owners of those 3-room flats may be low income earners, but their kids could be grads earning lots of $$$$$$.
 

2) If you observe, u will realise Hdb don't put all 3-rm flats in one area (less the super old estates). If there's a block of 3-rm flats there will be 4 & 5-rms and even EA, EM right next to it, sharing the same carpark. Those build in recent years even have studio, 3,4,5-rm flats all built into the same block. You can't be sure who owns those cars, right?
 

This is to prevent an area from becoming a "slum", if u know what i mean. Our neighboring countries have this problem.

May I ask the location where you made the observation?  Not surprising, resale 3 rm flats in central area are selling north of $300k, that's more than the $ I bought my flats at.  I'm driving a Volvo.
 

I do also see luxury cars (SLK, 911, 7 series, S-Class) on overnight parking coupon in my HDB carpark occasionally, OT at mistress'   place?

yes it is true
 

there are many living from pay check to pay check but on the "outside" looks very kilat with big house big car
 

i know a neighbour who lives in the old kallang airport living frugally but owns several shop houses in lavender 
 

to each his own
 

nobody really questions the ministers asset as by right being civil servants they have to declare
 

i just cannot understand how come our president earns 3 millions dollars a year without a need to hold any responsibility to make any major decision for the country

or for that matter ministers who performed poorly still earns 2-3 million dollars a year while the rest of us are still quarrelling about a few hundred here and there for our salary
 
 

who did we get into this deep s h i t
 

at the end of the day, to each his own, and happiness is definited differently for different people

since we all have only 1 life to live, some believe in LIVING NOW rather than retirement comes as then we may be too old to show off to our friends

why not?  I don't see your logic.
 

I buy a 3-room flat and I can rent out my condo. The rental from the condo probably could pay off my monthly 3 room HDB mortgage plus some change. The spare  change can be plough back to pay the mortgage of the condo. 
 

Most people with high salaries does this. This is how they own several properties but they would stay at the HDB while renting out all the privates. The rental yield from the privates is enough the pay off all their properties and they basically work for fun.

Err.....then if really high salary what do you do?
 

Just put all the money in the bank? 
 

Or keep buying private? That's of course is possible, but if we can leverage on the cheaper HDB to make more, why not?
 

When did you see a  high salary earner would ever be satisfied with whatever he is earning?
 

Most of my colleagues who probably earn more than me are staying in HDB while renting out all their condos. And this is also why you may see some big cars in the HDB carparks.

2 fallacies here:
 

1. Assuming a person's income based ont he car her/she drives

2. Assuming a person's wealth by the type of housing he/she stays in
 

Put those 2 together: This statement doesn't hold up much

Whether a person is lame or not got nothing to do with whether he is rich or not.  

WB does it not becos, it can save him that few thousand dollars worth of rent. 

But becos of sentimental reasons.
 

If you dont understand the difference, then you may never understand the difference. 

I hope you understand, for your own good sake 
 

Plenty of folks like you in forums, use single minority exceptions as basis of their arguments without understanding the truth behind.

Common. 
 

Anyway, why should you be so affected by what i think is lame?  

Or did you get pricked when i mentioned that you opinion of high salary is actually not high?

If so, i apologised that that remark made you feel small.

Usually housing agents and insurance agents?? Care to share your insight on this?



 
 

Nope.
 

The millionaires living in HDB flats are majority, people in their older years, people who have done a lifetime of work concientiously and are usually retired or semi-retired.  People who have saved hard and invested fairly and have brought up their kids to adulthood in the honest Singaporean way.
 

That said, they are usually not true millionaires in the effective sense of the word.

They may have a paid up hdb and net worth of more than $1mil but usually less than $2mil.

oic....I thought of housing agents and insurance agents as I have came across quite a few of them very well to do and staying in hdb flat and so wonder if it is a common trend. I once read somewhere that one of ERA's top agent is also staying in hdb flat (can't rem the name)..

Staying in private houses doesn't mean you have to own an expensive car leh.
 

There are people driving a taxi only.Thought saw one in Siglap,one in Chestnut area. 
 

Similarly the logic that 3 room HDB dwellers shoud not be owning cars also doesn't stand.

Yeah , my 3 room neighbors here drive mostly premium contis, plenty of Mercies , Bimmers, Audis, etc..and the odd handful of supercars.  

Japanese and Korean cars also have, but much lesser.



 

Are you talking about 3 bedroom condo unit?

I agreed with you.  types of flat does not really reflect a person or family financial accurately compare to 10 or 20 yr ago.

As the saying goes: it's not how much you earn, but how much you save.
 

There are a lot of millionaires living in HDB flats. They are often referred as 'Crouching Tigers, Hidden Dragons' - unwilling to flaunt their wealth with material purchases.



 

Agree, looking at the thousands of households who benefited financially from the last en-bloc fever in 07/08, and assuming they want to take it easy their choice is very clear, choose HDB flats in central location D1-12.

the garment shld start to relook at how subsidies are allocated to each type of HDB unit.
 

currently, those 1 or 3 room flat gets the most subsidies and 5 room and above, always gets the lowest.
 

we all know that ppl staying in smaller units doesn't mean they belong to low income group, and yet they are enjoying the higher subsidies. 
 

isn't something is wrong? 
 

I used to be one of the examples.....

Hrrr....all resale flats dont have income ceiling restrictions mah. At most dont qualify for HDB loan lor. Still got bank loan mah.
 

I just heard a ex-classmate of mine stay in a 3-room flat and rent out thier condo unit. 
 

Die-hard DINKS, so house size is not a problem for them. They just wana max thier income capacity and retire early. 
 

Btw, they both drive and own thier own car.
