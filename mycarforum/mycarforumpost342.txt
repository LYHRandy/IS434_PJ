you need to ask yourself what's yr risk profile bro?  If not for investment, just to stay... it's OK to buy at current level.  on the short term (next few years), looking at the economic indicators, global vs domestic  the trend is on the upside till 2009-2010.  Beyond that 2010, it's pure crystal ball...........by the way, if u intend to stay....no issue.

But you have you seen the condo prices in the area whereby you wanted to buy a flat? Chances are that it will be extra 70-90% more for an equally sized condo in a suburban area. If in prime areas, prices as be as much as 300% more!
 
Not to forget, if you are getting loan on private properties, your interest rate will be very much higher than HDB's.

hdb cov is ridiculous.
 
e.g. west side, 5 room unit.  valuation 320k.  cov 40k. so u pay like 360k.
downpayment = 5% + cov = 16k + 40k = 56k
reno = 40k (hdb normally not so nice so u gotta spend more on reno)
total cash = 96k
 
3 bedroom condo 500k at valuation.
downpayment = 5% = 25k
reno = 10k (find a good condition condo, normally juz need touch up)
total cash = 35k
 
so which is better?  condo la cos cash is king.

Yes bro, my math same as yours. My only hold back is, HDB pay up full with little cash left yet condo will come with a loan but with more cash on hand. In long term, I really wonder the condo value will become like what.

3 bedroom condo (assumed to be 1200sq ft) at 500K? That will be in a super ulu location + old leasehold condo. Then if thats the case, a 5 room HDB flat in that area will cost around 280K.
 
With current prices, even a 2 bedroom leasehold condo in jurong west area is going for >500K.

bank interest shouldn't be an issue here. sine he's considering condo, his income is probably higher than the income ceiling for HDB loan and so even if he buys HDB he also need to go for bank loan and not the HDB loan.

On the super high side now for condos. Only old condos with large land area and possible plot upgrades can have enblock potential, so I think upside is limited.
 
Years back, I was faced with the same question, I went for a fully paid resale flat. On hindsight, its better as I do not have to worry during the slump years and live a stress free life. 
 
If I had gotten a condo, its still about breakeven now or slightly higher, same as HDB, in terms of appreciation.
 
Not sure about the future though, it could go either way.

many who have make their money from property boom in 1990's also commented propery being a 10 yrs cycle and many are selling their investment instead of buying at this current period.
 
Most new/less than 5 yrs condos have in fact gone up above 50 percent in value making it very tough for first timer to buy. But my personal feel is that this time round, we might not be as vulnerable as compared to the last downtrend being continuous hit by  finiancial crisis in asia, sept 11, iraq wars and sars. At least ahead of us is our IR projects and our aim to increase populations, i feel such factor can probably stablised our property in the event of crisis.

For property, we have to look at economic of the country, the bulk of foreign investor, financial sector life cycle. it only take one factor such as sept 11 as you mentioned to add or minus a few years to the cycle. 
 
Without the SARs, we would have bloom 1-2 years earlier

The answer is simple. Even millionaires do not pay up their flat one shot. Because interest rate on housing loans are low compared to say current returns in the markets. And it will go lower when FED continues to lower the interest rates. When that happens, market returns will go even higher.
 
So why would you want to fully pay up, when that money can be use to make far more returns?

By paying up fully, you are spending "today's" money. If you take a loan, you'll be paying with "tomorrow's" money, which will probably be worth less.
 
Just think back to 20 years ago. A 3-rm condo could be had for $300,000. But $300,000 was big money then. If you had taken a 20 year loan, you'd just about finish paying it now. But what you are paying as installment for your condo now, is about the same as that others pay in installment for a HDB bought recently.
 
Sorry if I'm not being very coherent (after lunch, lah).

A 20-year-old condo is a 20-year-old condo.
 
A $300K HDB flat bought recently can be a brand new DBSS flat build by private developer that is almost same standard as new condos and definately higher standard than a 20-year-old condo.
 
So cannot compare like this.

No, what I'm saying is, if you take a loan, the installment amount you may now, say "$1,000" will become peanuts 18-20 years later, because of inflation, higher wages, time value of money etc.
 
Hence, the comparison between the 20 yr-old condo and the new HDB.
Both their installemnts could well be the same at this point.

Just an update, I got a 3 room flat with top up of only $6k cash above valuation!!! Seller sure bang hard table. In case you all want to know why, initial agreed selling price is $192k based on estimated valuation of about $170k. 3 days after signing the agreement, the actual valuation came out to be $185k!!! In resale market, selling $25k above valuation is a norm which means this flat could have sell for $210k!!! Current market is going from crazy to mad especially 3 rooms and 4 rooms flat.
 
One piece of advise here, most...I said most of the housing agents are jerks! That is why I sold off my 4 room flat without any agent. It saves me about $10k of commission. You all should try marketing your own flat, it does not take too much time, you have control over everything, might even be fun to screw up those buyer's agents.

Underutilized 4 room flat, so I sold it. Downgrade into 3 room so that I can pay off using CPF and in this case, plus a top up of $6k cash. 
 
For your info, no matter where the flat is located does not matters, my observation is as long as they are high floor, they will fetch high valuation.

so that amt spend is on cash as last I check, renovation loan is not cheap. and the amount could be as high as 100k.. but the norm would be 40k?
 
as for monthly maintenance fee, don't you have to pay to town council on a monthly basis? how about car parking? how much would you have to pay if you have 2 car? 
 
I'm not saying that HDB is not good but we need to look beyond

not all condos charges extra, but it is still the decision of the MC. so if you have a F-up MC, you are kinda screwed.   
 
Especially condos which have a smaller footprint...

So majority wise, they don't charge extra. 
 
anyway, that's not the point. 
 
The point is that after taking into account of carparking for one car and the maintenance fee, it doesn't cost much to stay in a normal condo compared to HDB.

well, 180 is pretty cheap. coz my hdb conservancy should be around 200-300...

 Buying any type of housing now is crazy. If u have no urgent need for one, I suggest that u wait.
 
Guys, I would like to ask some of the expert here...
 
Is it advisable to buy a new HDB flat now??? Notice the price went up a bit as compare to 1-2 yrs ago...but not as much as resale flats.
 
Any comment on a new $350K 90sqm 4room flat at Toa Payoh as compared to a new $260K 130sqm exec flat at CCK, Bt Panjang or Jurong west? Or even Exec Mansionatte at west area around $320K...
 
% room at west area are around $200-$230K for new.
 
Which will you guys choose???

I am agree with you, I am stay in Condo even not fully flagged one. Second car is free but thrid car need to pay this is to prevent some unscrouplous people who takes advantage parking their relatives car in the estate to save paying season parking (some people can be tight *ss). I am still serving my loan, once a while I have thought why I am not taking HDB which I can fully paid with my DP. But when I am thinking about conviniences and cleanlines I never regret my decision.

it depends largely on your area of ops, meaning where are your workplace and others staying in the flat, where your parents staying at, mid-term plans.
 
say the workplaces and parents are located near central area, it would be more advisable to go for TPY. however, if you are planning for children (assuming married), you got to consider if you want to upgrade after 5 years (which is quite reasonable because your child/children should be below 5 and can share room).
 
if not central, the $260k exec flat would be preferred over the $320k one.
 
for me, i would choose TPY (however depends on which level, facing and few other factors).

I have seen Parkview, acceptable as I got 2 daughters. But again, can't be jobless else sleep on the street liao..
 
Even if u buy HDB on commercial loan & default they will also repo? If u lose job, you can rent our ur condo freely to service ur loan. Condo maintainance is really worth it esp if u have 2 cars  .

condos also charge you extra when you have 2 cars la. and especially if you have F-up management committee, you are basically paying huge sums of money to be screwed.
Not all condos will charge extra for 2nd car la, so far have not heard on a friend or colleague condo charge extra for 2nd car.  Unless like what you said F-up management committe, but I would call them "money minded".
 
This is called thinking like pay & pay  . Anyway at the end of the day $ in condo goes to sinking fund to pay for upkeep of condo. In HDB, goes to pay salaries

A condo may not be expensive if you take into account of the amount you spend on renovation for a bare HDB vs a condo that have their flooring, kitchen, bathrooms, etc done up. 
 
just the air con alone can be worth up to 10k. 
 
You buy cheap for HDB and don't have to fork out cash for the flat but when it come to renovation, if you are not cash rich, try asking what is the going rate for renovation loan. 
 
Thus HDB is not really a cheap option as well. 
 
 
Thus, enjoy your home when you can afford it. Don't look back and think if you are going to be better off with HDB.

$10k for aircon? Too much... a system 4 jap-brand aircon cost me only $4k 6 yrs ago. it should be cheaper now.
 
$100k to do up a 5-rm hdb will give u a very comfy home. so with less than $500k, one can stay very comfortably in a 5 rm flat. whereas in a condo, $500k can maybe buy you a studio apartment.
 
and i pay $67 in C&C and another $90 for car park, less than $200 a mth. The newer estate are pretty better managed and kept clean at all times, with playground, running tracks and exercise corners and badminton/basket ball court just below the flats and some with basement carpark with lifts straight up to the flats. Exception is no swimming pool, tennis courts, bbq pits.
 
the newer hdb estate has definitely improved a lot with more amenities.

Yes that is correct. But please do not go to Ah Huat Coffee Shop, order the $1.50 Chicken rice and start to whine that the chicken rice at Chatterbox looks nicer. Also for those who already tar pau Chatterbox Chicken Rice dont get pissed when overhearing someone at Ah Huat Coffee Shop remark that he is an idiot to buy chicken rice at Chatterbox cos it's so expensive. 

When you buy Chatterbox chicken rice you not only buy chicken rice but you buy quality, environment and status. When you eat the chicken rice at Ah Huat Coffee Shop you dont get the same quality. So - bottom line: the extra cost you pay are often including intangibles and not for pure chicken rice per-se. 

So as long as at the end of the day you feel shiok and stim ... you have made the right choice. No point calculating, inflation factor, floting interest potential etc.... remember - end of the day Shiok & Stim ...

if it was me
 
i would buy the best location HDB that my money can buy
 
 
why
 
hdb is a subsidize housing (suppose to be)
when your family salary increased you may not be qualified to buy
hdb is a fail safe living because no body is going to kick you out unlike privte property when you cant pay up your mortgage
once you pay up for your hdb it becomes an asset and not liability
the property market comes in cycle, you are young and you can wait
if you buy hdb you dont have to service loan and use extra cash for investment and grwo your money
time is essential for investment especially if you are young

Buy a resale HDB and top up a few Ks of cash over valuation to fully own it. 
then buy a pte and stay there, renting the HDB out at 1.5k to 2k and use it to service the Pte pty loan which could be 3-4k a month.

i can answer ur question cos i did juz tat, bot in the same area, about 100m walk away.
 
1.  when u drive home, u get a friendly wave from the security guard as u drive through the entrance, instead of having to take small lanes leading to a mscp
2.  carpark is spanking clean and new looking, whereas mscp was dark and dirty, with smaller sized lot
3.  can park anywhere, no worries about vandals, lorries or trucks that will give u dents
4.  take lift to ground floor.  mscp need to take stairs that is sometimes stinking with urine
5.  short walk to block.  mscp longer walk
6.  dun need to look at where u step.  hdb grass area have lots of dog sxxt!
7.  oh i left my cashcard in car.  condo safe so is ok.  mscp... no cashcard oso kena breakeven cos they steal coupon and wat not
8.  did i mention i can park 3 cars free?  hdb need to pay $90/car!  my condo monthly fees is $260 all in (incl sinking fund)!  comes with security, very good cleaners, unlike hdb banglas, full facilities (incl air con lounge, sauna room, gym, pools, tennis courts, mahjong room, etc)
9.  when u walk from carpark to unit, the feel is totally different, plus lifts always in clean and good condition.  hdb?  urine, dog sxxt, graffiti, etc.
10. sold hdb at 230k and bot condo at 525k.  hdb now 280k, condo now 688k.  all within 3 years!
 
so there!  and the list goes on (e.g. no corridor windows so very private!, etc so many more things!!!!!!!!!).  u gotta live in a well managed condo to appreciate the difference.  it certainly made a great difference for me and overall, improved my quality of life cos when i reach home, i feel so relaxed and happy.

This only true if you take loan from HDB, if resale and funding from the bank it's the same with private......if defaulted.
 
Further:
 
CPF loan is pegged at 0.1% above what you should be earning if it was left in the Ordinary Account. But if you were to sell your flat, you have to pay back into CPF the amount that you have taken out, PLUS the interest it should have earned. Indirectly, once a person takes on a CPF housing loan, he is also taking on the responsibility from the government to earn the 2.5%, as well as to give the government 0.1% in the process.

Most likely no.... you might say yes because u are saying what society trained u to say.

on a serious note, hdb do boot u out if u can't svc yr loan.  recently, my sis's mil had to "force sell" her hdb to open market cos nvr svc loan for few mths. 
 

fyi, not sure whether still applicable or not.  if yr OA kosong, can use SA to svc yr loan.  but if u sell yr pigeon hole, got to repay the monies fm SA then OA.

whats the diff between Condo and HDB flat if they are in the same area. side by side. 
If want to buy a condo, buy in exclusive area. 
Otherwise dont waste money.
It's all about improving one's living environment.
Many buy for the sake of saying, "i live in a condo!"   
 
Singaporeans will be Singaporeans.  
I know becos i'm Singaporean too, except without the herd instinct, 
Lastly and very importantly, dont chew more than you can bite, it WILL choke you.

 
 
Agree with you. there's the typical Singaporean that bite more than they can chew so that they can say they live in a condo but then, staying in a condo is not just about location alone.

I fully paid my hdb loan in 4 yrs. Till today, I never have the urgency to buy a condo. People need to realize that condo is not the ultimate. Savings enough to retire comfortably is.

what's yr take on such behaviour?  cos their argument if i don't recall wrongly was "they also pay maintenance fees and what not".  but, i remember if there's any increase in the general maintenance of a condo, it will be passed onto all the residents right?

You can't stay in condo and rent out HDB, it's not allowed according to HDB rules based on what I last checked. You can only stay in HDB and rent out the condo.   If can, please let me know as I was looking along this line.

 
 
eh. you can rent out your flat but not the whole place..

Bro...just another pointer to build on your idea   Apparently, apart from urea, your "dragon", "horse" or "bird" oso produces a mixture equivalent to the birds-nest in terms of poly-peptide or amino acid value. You can give that recipe a try oso   It might be famous with the locals cos aside from its nutritional application, one can oso use it as a "cum facial"

Lets put it in another light.If tonight u dio toto and have 10 million dollars deposited into your account. Will u still stay in your HDB and Drive a cheap Jipunese car?
Most likely no.... you might say yes because u are saying what society trained u to say.
 
Everybody does what they wish as they like...
that's perfectly fine..
 
what's sad are those people who dont have 10 million dollars trying to justify that they are better off not having that 10 million because they dont as a matter of fact...
 
errr anyone get it yet?

Maybe the condo can start an ERP gantry on those that want to shower in common bathroom.

hdb is a fail safe living because no body is going to kick you out unlike privte property when you cant pay up your mortgage   
 
I think you also need to be more responsible with your suggestions as well. 
 
Are you very the sure HDB don't take back your flat when you can't service the loan? They have not done it doesn't means they will not do it.

 
  Yah, they have not done it doesn't mean they won't do it...but bro, I believe its often the last last last resort...
 
ya.. when they up the ERP gantry and adjust the price, it's also the last last resort. 
 
and you think the bank is not using it as a last resort when someone cannot service a loan?

I see. Anyway i dunno whats the reason. Abt 6 mths ago, i ballot for clementi new flat, price range from 300k to 400k plus. Now the latest bi monthly sale, its selling price increase 480k for a ground floor unit. Its like increase quite a lot despite its the same flat. If its in a resale mkt, i can understand but dunno why HDB inflate the price further by so much within 6 mths.

Ok back to the topic...
 
My humble opinion is it depends on what is your aim. Whether it is for investment or for residing. Once this is determined, it is easier to make a choice between the 2  
 
Having said the above, there are also many other factors that may turn your consideration this or that way, such as location, price and tenure (99 yr lease or freehold), etc...
 
Thus, the question cannot be answered in a simple sweeping statement as some put up, some put down...hence, there are bound to be different opinions justifying their ups and downs

3.  can park anywhere, no worries about vandals, lorries or trucks that will give u dents
 
My car just kenna scratched by dunno who parking in my condo car park.
 
Although mine is EC... so maybe not "condo" enough ??? :)
 
Anyway, the carpark still feel SLIGHTLY safer than normal hdb carpark.
 
The thing about housing loan.... it is really stressing, for me at least. Especially when you keep seeing the interest rate shoot up, you are basically at the mercy of the banks... DON'T expect the rate to remain at what you signed up for in the beginning. Great relief for me when I cleared my housing loan. I really really don't want to take a big loan again.

Mine's a new "condoms-minium" development called the "Hot rider"   It has multiple studs along it's exterior that resembles the tenticles of an octopus   Needless to say its function is to stick onto the "habitat" or individual "unit" for more contact and feel  
 
Makes the inhabitants feel "high" even though he may be residing on "low floors"

i can answer ur question cos i did juz tat, bot in the same area, about 100m walk away. 
1.  when u drive home, u get a friendly wave from the security guard as u drive through the entrance, instead of having to take small lanes leading to a mscp
2.  carpark is spanking clean and new looking, whereas mscp was dark and dirty, with smaller sized lot
3.  can park anywhere, no worries about vandals, lorries or trucks that will give u dents
4.  take lift to ground floor.  mscp need to take stairs that is sometimes stinking with urine
5.  short walk to block.  mscp longer walk
6.  dun need to look at where u step.  hdb grass area have lots of dog sxxt!
7.  oh i left my cashcard in car.  condo safe so is ok.  mscp... no cashcard oso kena breakeven cos they steal coupon and wat not
8.  did i mention i can park 3 cars free?  hdb need to pay $90/car!  my condo monthly fees is $260 all in (incl sinking fund)!  comes with security, very good cleaners, unlike hdb banglas, full facilities (incl air con lounge, sauna room, gym, pools, tennis courts, mahjong room, etc)
9.  when u walk from carpark to unit, the feel is totally different, plus lifts always in clean and good condition.  hdb?  urine, dog sxxt, graffiti, etc.
10. sold hdb at 230k and bot condo at 525k.  hdb now 280k, condo now 688k.  all within 3 years!
 
so there!  and the list goes on (e.g. no corridor windows so very private!, etc so many more things!!!!!!!!!).  u gotta live in a well managed condo to appreciate the difference.  it certainly made a great difference for me and overall, improved my quality of life cos when i reach home, i feel so relaxed and happy.

 
 
Fair enough reasons Arowana.  very acceptable, sensible opinions
 
Here's mine in more details:-
 
8 years ago, I was looking at bigger Condos outside district 9, 10, 11.
Then it struck me, that getting a Condo outside those areas means I still have to drive 40mins to work, pass by boring scenery and "not so pleasant" environment.  
 
I know I might offend people if I say this but please read with an open mind what i may say next.
 
A $2mil condo comes with $2mil type neighbors and environment and a $500k condo will come with $500k type neighbors.  The choice for me is similar to the following:  Buy a new $100k Toyota Camry or a much much older Porsche taking all else equal. nothing wrong with Camry, but I would pick the Porsche.  
 
Buying a property is not only about location. It is both Location and Site (environment around the development).
A simple example, is Geylang.  The location is actually good but the site may not be, depending on how one views it. heh heh.
 
 
So in the end, I paid the same price I would have if I had bot a 2000sf 99 year Condo outskirts, for an almost equally big but old freehold property (not a condo) at the edge of D9. also Spent some good money to renovate it.
 
For me, the ease of travel, the great neighborhood and the buzzy exciting feeling of closeness to Orchard in itself is already worth every cent.  I'm not commenting on the value of that property now though.
 
I'm glad you are enjoying your place.  I know i have a bad habit of not writing very long and detailed posts so may often get misunderstood.  But this is what i actually mean...
 
phheewww, very time consuming to type so much....sweat...

Throttle2, 
 
glad to hear you made the right choice.  edge of d9 means u can sell now at very good profits!!!  
 
actually there are a lot of considerations when getting a property and it is all based on individual preferences and comfort.
 
on hindsight, i should have gone for central or east cos they appreciate faster or even get 2 units but then again, hindsight is always 20-20.  but as i had to make sure im comfortable with the financial commitment, outskirts condo was my only option since im lacking cash for major reno and needed bigger space more than anything else.

I would advise that for 650k condo you should put DP 20% cash..maybe 10-20% CPF. So u loan only 60%-70%, which means 390k-450k loan if payable over 20 years monthly instalment is about 2.4k, of which if say u & ur spouse earn more than 4 k each, the CPF contribution is 1.8k, so cash outlay is ard $600 a month. The idea is to pay faster so less interest incurred and you wont hit the CPF withdrawal limit.

Another consideration is the salary ceiling for CPF contribution now is $4500 nia. Inclusive of employers portion, you get maximum only $1552.5 of which only 0.6667 goes towards your ordinary account ($1035). Therefore, assuming both husband and wife 's salary more than 4.5K or more, the maximum combined OA funds per month is about $2070. The rest got to top up using cash!

One thing I am still puzzled till now. Are we allowed to stay in a Condo, but at the same time own a HDB flat, assuming the latter is being rented out. There seems to be many cases like these around. I thought this is not allowed by HDB?

u should not look straight to condo or even resale.  buy new hdb!  if lack funds, get ulu place one.  after 5 years, can sell at the right time and move on to condo.  easier said than done but can be done, provided one takes action early.  i see lots of young folks like to whine about cost yet when ask them apply for new units at jurong, all shout and scream but same time, whine and whine about not able to afford a place of their own cos they want mature estate!
 
lots of ways to work out wat u want.  i graduated with almost $12k study loan, no parents to fall back to cos im the only person here in sinkieland, applied for the cheapest and shortest q hdb unit and moved on from there.  im happy with where i am now but if i were to juz whine and whine 12 years ago, i will probably still be renting a room.

I have been through the cycle of house hunting too to settle down. While I understand and sympathise with the people that are getting married and waiting for a flat, I agree with your point that it is one matter if there is simply insufficient flats to meet demand and another completely different story to meet demands of people who want to stay in certain preferred estates. Crude side of reality: If one still want to choose, pay the price (resale) or count on your good fortune during balloting.

You are right, only $50k annual should not get condo.  but HDB defintely can.
One must be willing to prioritise his targets.
 
Do you own a car?  and how much are you a slave to your car?
Maybe you should drop the car then you'll feel more at ease buying a flat.

Below is what I pulled of HDB website, which means still cannot.
 
 
If you sublet your rooms to subtenants, you and your family must continue to stay in the flat with the subtenants during the period of subletting.
 
Locking up one room and subletting the remaining ones while you and your family stay elsewhere is deemed as unauthorised subletting of the whole flat. HDB may take action against you for the infringement by compulsorily acquiring the flat under the Housing & Development Act. 
 
eh. you can rent out your flat but not the whole place..

Your CPF withdrawal limit for your property is fixed at about 110-130% of your purchase price. Hence after u hit the withdrawal limit you have to service your loan purely with cash. Some people dont care & take out high % or 30 year loans, but they will hit this limit later. Well some ppl dont think so far & plan to sale their place down the road anyway. Often in a 25 year loan the total repayment is double your initial loan amount so a 60% loan is safe cos you r not likely to hit the CPF withdrawal milit later.

Just to share
 
i am 31 this yr, got married at 25 which is 6 yrs ago. Apply for a Punggol flat then, at that time there is lots of "unwanted" flats. Within 2-3 mths got my keys cause i had chosen those unwanted unit. So i got my 5 room flat on a low floor for 202K. Lived in it for about 5 yrs until oneday i cant stand punggol. Thought it was a happening place, 6 yrs on the area is still undeveloped and with those F16 flying everyday it had become unbearable for me.
 
However we rented out our place for $2300 a mth. Do u know how much ROI is that? 13.6% returns! where to find? So currently i am paying $1740 in 100% cash towards the monthly installment for my flat, still have about 4 years left to clear my housing loans. After clearing my flat i will start to look for a condo for investment and rental for old age.
I will probably never gonna stay in a condo ever. 
 
Curently i rent a 3rm flat in marine parade for $1100. A 3rm flat in marine parade will cost about 300-380k now depending on location n if it is facing the sea..... however the rental for a 3rm will never exceed that of a 5 rm. 
 
My advice to you is to get a 5rm or bigger HBD flat directly from HDB. Rent it out if u don't like the area n stay somewhere else.
 
I have friends staying in Condos and they are paying crazy installments. borrowing 500k on 4% interest alone will kill u. interest alone P.A is about 20K. Stretch that to 30yrs loan u might be paying 600k in interest.

Are condo prices on the high or low side currently? Need advise from anyone, thanks.
 
if it was me
 
i would buy the best location HDB that my money can buy
 
 
why
 
hdb is a subsidize housing (suppose to be)
when your family salary increased you may not be qualified to buy
hdb is a fail safe living because no body is going to kick you out unlike privte property when you cant pay up your mortgage
once you pay up for your hdb it becomes an asset and not liability
the property market comes in cycle, you are young and you can wait
if you buy hdb you dont have to service loan and use extra cash for investment and grwo your money
time is essential for investment especially if you are young
 
Something depressing for you to read:

One thing I am still puzzled till now. Are we allowed to stay in a Condo, but at the same time own a HDB flat, assuming the latter is being rented out. There seems to be many cases like these around. I thought this is not allowed by HDB?
 
Yes it can be done.  As long as your HDB fulfill the requirement HDB has before you rent it out. It does not matter how many other private properties you have.

the HDB rulling is stil NO, even you fulfil the requirement of HDB, as long as you own HDB and private property(ies), you will need to stay in HDB and rent out private property. but who cares???

I fully paid my hdb loan in 4 yrs. Till today, I never have the urgency to buy a condo. People need to realize that condo is not the ultimate. Savings enough to retire comfortably is.
 
Sometimes pple buy condo is to use it as a hedge against inflation. You can save $500K cash now. 30 years down the road, $500K might not be even able to get you a 2 room flat.

I always maintain, HDB should close shop. Cheap public housing is in the past. A simple analogy, if private taxi companies does not come in, do u all think we gonna have blue sonatas running around?  It's F.U.B.A.R
