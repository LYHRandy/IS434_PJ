Less than 1k per month (much cheaper than rental) and able to use CPF + 40k grant for first timers. Looks pretty affordable to me but I'm sure some people are going to start complaining about the location.

These flats are pretty big ~ 120 sq m. That is like the size of a point blk 5 room. I thought most 4 rooms are approx 90 to 100 sq m (for the older generation ones) while the new ones are between 80 to 90+ sq m.

Haha, I don't think we need the ST to tell us that these are not prime locations. Look at the estates they are in - Jurong West, woodlands, sembawang. I don't think it is fair to say they are about 30 years old from the list you posted. The newest (sembawang) is only 8 years old and the oldest is only 22 years.
 

That said, we cannot discount the possiblity that the information is biased since they only show "some" resale transactions below $300k. These could have been outliers. One thing it does prove is that there are cheap flats to be had if one is willing to ignore the location and search for bargains.

I was just passing a comment on the sizes that's all. Know that it's a cut and paste.
 

Anyway, my estate's 4 room can sell for way higher based on the pamphlets I received in my junk mail. And mine is an old estate with smaller 4 rooms vs the data up there.
 

I guess this mantra is true: Location, location and location.

1st...those 120 sqm n abv r not 4 rm. 2nd, the transacted price may b affordable, but it's the cov that is putting off a lot of young buyers...incl me. i'm looking for a flat now, n it's impossible. where on earth can a young couple get 10-20k cash??? n after buying, still need to take reno loan.
 

the prices r no doubt reasonable, if only they do away with the cov.

COV isn't the fault of the government, the buyers or the sellers. COV is the fault of the valuers who seem to consistently undervalue flats leading to the high COV transactions you see.



 

Although we can technically attribute COV as the fault of the valuers, I feel that greedy sellers and stupid buyers that willingly offer so-called "high COV" and hence setting a precedence should also share the blame.  But this is just solely my opinion.
 

For example:

A typical seller will be asking for say $500k or $50k above valuation, whichever is higher. So if the actual valuation is say $440k, the seller will be looking to sell for $500k which means $60k COV. But if the valuation is raised up to $460k, then the seller may be willing to settle for $50k COV and sell at $510k.
 

On the above example, we can blame the higher COV on lower valuation given by the valuer. But my point is that even when valuation has gone up, the seller will usually stick to their guns and ask for the same amount of COV and not adjust it downwards. And the seller has every right to try to make as much profit as possible.
 

Which brings me to my 2nd point that stupid buyers that agree to these ridiculous COV too readily and hence setting a precedence. This is very blatant during the 2007 enbloc craze where the enbloc owners that fell into a pot of gold and started offering crazy COV when they downsize to HDB. 
 

This will only stop when buyers start to put their foot down and refuse to pay such high COV to sellers. Unfortunately you still get people that spoil the market and by spoiling the market, they are also making it tougher for their future generation to own a flat....

n where did they get the cash?they loan! n on top of that...they took ANOTHER loan of IIRC abt $20k+ for reno. how idiotic is that! these r the kind of ppl, along with those already cash rich, who willingly pay high cov n spoiling the market for everyone else!

govt say must have COV. so its here to stay.



 

More correct to say is that COV is not to be banned. Let market forces decide how far COV can possibly go.
 

Ultimately, when all propective buyers reject a unit with 100K COV, the seller will need to lower it unless he/she decides not to sell... same rationale applies for 50K COV.... 30k COV... 10k COV...
 

Even a unit trying to sell at valuation and but the highest offer that it could fetch is 20K below valuation, seller will have to decide between that and no sale ah

over 120+ sqm for 4A highly unlikely laa.... So far the biggest I've seen is 111 sqm.



 

Not sure what's the unit size, the table shows block 625, he stays 623. It's certainly the biggest 4 room I've seen. Living room is a big square. Maybe it's a typo not 120+ sqm.
 

Saying about sembawang, I seriously hate this place. Want to buy things, eat nice food or go for bank services got to travel to yishun/woodlands. Bus service sux big time, most pathetic bus interchange ever. Peak hours take mrt from town, always terminate at yishun.

I think the high COV is the fault of housing agents !
 

they and their ads always claim to help sellers "sell your house at xxxxx COV guaranteed! or we buy your house! " WTF

then, these agents will go and tell all the buyers that the "market price" at least must prepare to pay xxxxx COV , or else dont think of buying !

If you read my very wordy post carefully, I distinctively mentioned that ....the seller has every right to try to make as much profit as possible.



 

Oops, just trying to get in a different point of view...

Apologise for not reading properly :)
 

Me not agent...

Me not selling...

Me not buying...
 

But when agent ask me if i wanna sell, i tell him 80k COV.

Reason: Dun want to sell, unless someone really offer this type of $$
 

So far someone offer 60k, ask to view, i say no...

Look like you got wrong illustration of Agents. The Guaranteed sell they give TC at 90% of Valuation. Note it is 90% valuation not 90% of market price hor.

4'A' unit I think. My uncle's 4'A' in Yishun is same size or even bigger (to me) than my block's 5 room in Sembawang. Those whole block is 4 room, corridor units are typical 4 room and corner unit is 4'A'.




 4A unit is 105 Sqm. they look as big as the current 5 room because they can knock down the store room lah... most will knock down the store room anyway.

I also agree that high cov is bec of sucker agents.

My COV was $20k
 

The agent told my mom and sis that got people offer 18k cov and owner asking 20k.

In the end my mom and sis "buay lun" and told the agent ok 20k sign immediately.   [thumbsdown] 
 

My original offer for COV only $8k max. In the end gonna pay 20k!!!   [sweatdrop]

You think they got alot of money from the 20K COV meh?? at most will be 200 to 400 extra only. The agent is just doing his job to tell you what is the offer given at that point of time. if you think its not worth the price, all you have to do is just reject the offer. if not, dont complain. 

Anyway the agent salary is base on % of the whole hse selling price and not base on COV of the house selling price. If they can close their deal at valuation price, they will be very happy. You think they want to stuck in a flat that need to advertise for 4 to 5 months before they can get the sales meh??
 

I wonder if you never get the deal and realise that the agent did not tell you someone offer 18K COV how will you feel.

If there is an offer of 18k COV on the table, which seller in the right mind will even want to consider your 8k? It is either you up it, or you back out. Both decisions are ultimately your decision (as a buyer alone). Like that also can push blame to agent?? Sounds like taiji leh.

Asking and transacted price is different. I can spend 40$ to put an advertisement in the papers asking for 2 mil for a HDB. 1 mil + COV!

is it the stupidity of buyers that lead to this COV thing?



 

Buyers are not stupid unless they pay above the market price. If 50k COV is the market price, then how can they be stupid? (demand meets supply)
 

If you're complaining about housing prices in general and not COV, then the fault would lie primarily with the government who might not be releasing enough land(policy failure) and allowing the population to grow more opulent (definitely not policy failure here!)

If their complain is on housing price then reasonable. problem is, their complain also on the location of flats release. If government tomorrow suddenly say got 10,000 HDB flat release around woodlands, Sambawang and Jurong. i can ensure you the same group of ppl will still complain why all in out skirt region. I think government should stop producing flat at mature estate for 5 years and only buiild and develop in the outskirt then we can see clearly that the problem does not lie in the pricing of flat or the government but the mentallity of the ppl.

Heard from someone, they base it off current resale market price and then reduce the price by a few XXK.
