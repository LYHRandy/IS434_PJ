From your qns, the lowest property price is at $1.5M for a cash/cpf payment of $600k... probably most of the MCFers here who's into property investment go for smaller units so are outside your range

I got the same sentiment as u too... why despite the high property prices, they're still being snapped up... perhaps these pple are rich from the $$$ they've made in earlier investment(buying a few houses during the last financial crisis) & now sitting on huge profit after selling them... or they beg/borrow from the parents/relatives ???
 
Likewise, is so common these days to see all the mercs, beemers, jag on the roads... we're so left behind

As mentioned, this thread is under Property Buzz for a reason.Its becos i keep on hearing folks say Singaporeans very rich, everyone buying properties like nobodys business.
 
And If that is the case, it is senseless to start at $50k or $100k or $200k.
Better start at $500k up.
 
So perhaps the normal Singaporean or MCFer is not as rich as i have heard
Foreigners who can come here are the rich ones?
I dont know you guys tell me.
 
It has nothing to do with me being out of touch.
Cos i sure aint out of touch
I think i am too in touch, thats the problem
 
 
Thanks

Assuming double-degree family.
 
Monthly CPF 1000 x 12 months (exclude bonus) x 10 years x 2 (husband and wife) = 240k
Monthly CPF 1000 x 12 months (exclude bonus) x 20 years x 2 (husband and wife) = 480k
 
If you have less cash than CPF, you are probably a spender.   500k is therefore very achievable with savings and bonuses set aside over 10-20 years on a husband and wife basis.  CPF pays for first HDB flat so savings can buy 2nd private property with 50% down.

20yrs of salary at a flat rate of current?    Cool!
 
Ok so on avareage every 45yr old couple should be able to afford a $1mil condo as second property.
Now who is there and who is not there?

cash more important or investment that generate returns more important?
 
there was 1 point i'm 90% cash with 10% investment (blue chip stock only)
kena suan sibei jialat by so called "financial professional"
my cash value was eroding day-by-day
 
of course the discussion was to diversify my cash to bond/stock & investment like reit/property and insurance
so, was it bias view or professional view? lol
 
anyway, i do like the professionnal idea of keeping cashflow for 24-36 months ... in case of lose job or whatever
 
at the end of the day, not having $500k cash does not mean one is in bad shape
if you seek professional view and telling him you got $500k cash idling in the bank ... mostly will 
 
they will tell you all kind of grandpa grandma story to make your $$$ work harder instead of idling in the bank ... lol

Fully agreed but....Thats another discussion altogether.
 
Of course if have cash $500k lying around, must have also other investments lying elsewhere.
Not forgetting, if have cash and can allow it to drp value for the sake of waiting for opportunity, thats power man!

I should not be in this thread as I not doing business, so how much can a salaried man earn?
 
But I see flaw in your request as some might not have much cash but have a $2mil stock and share portfolio and properties that have risen in values and enjoying excellent passive rental income, while others might just  have $2mil cash lying around but living in a simple HDB house.
 
So if you want to see true picture, MUST put everything on the table including cash, stock/shares, potential property earning based on current market price, rental income, potential inheritance if any.
 
Then you can see how rich the people are. Cash alone is not true indicative of one's worth in total.

Oh yes most certainly. 
I am simplifying things for easy discussion and polling. Not talking networth here
Just talking about pure immediate disposable liquidity.
If stuck in some assets and not liquid enough how to hoot property?
 
And why cant people have $20mil in marketable securities yet have $5mil as opportunity war chest?
 
$2mil in stock and shares portfolio? I thought most Singaporeans have that?  
Either that or $2mil cash and HDB...?

 You have surrounded yourself with people of same status. You have come to think that certain level of wealth is normal. You are doing things that 95% of us will not do, and that is flaunting your wealth so blatantly.  Thank goodness you are not a politician, else the country can only go downhill from now with your level of out-of-touchness. Really.

I can only say let us stop wasting time in this thread. It can only get worse from here. 
 
Tell me who would divulge their TRUE net worth in public? Unless that person is dying to let the world know how rich he is. I for one am not giving that person more respect just because he is more loaded.
 
Come on, even you started the thread you also dont want to put a true figure down. Perhaps the figure you put is correct, just short of putting down a few zeroes, but i am not going to speculate. Have a nice weekend. Cheers.

My opinion is not.

It really depends on what you mean by normal Singaporeans. If you are referring to anyone that you can just point to in the street, I doubt many will have the means to pay for a $1m property in full without any form of leverage i.e. with cash only.
 
In fact, $1m in cold hard cash would be beyond the reach of most Singaporeans besides the top 10% of the adult Singaporean population in terms of material wealth. 
 
There was an ST article last year where it was reported there are only about 3,000 plus Singaporeans with net worth of SGD $30m and above. This is not a very large number of people compared to the size of the population.
 
If I were to hazard a guess, the liquidity that the adult Singaporean population may have can be summarised as:
 
Top 0.1%: More than $10m cash
 
Top 1%: More than $5m cash
 
Top 5%: More than $3m cash
 
Top 10%: More than $1m cash
 
Top 20%: More than $500k cash
 
Top 30%: More than $200k cash
 
With leverage of between 2x to 5x from loan facilities, about 20% to 30% of adult Singaporeans should be able to purchase a $1m property.
 
If you are talking about a $2m property, that number should fall to about 10% to 20% of adult Singaporeans.
 
The responses to your survey have summarised what it was meant to achieve in the first place i.e. underscore the point that in the event of a situation where prices fall and interest rates rise to make financing non-viable, the fast-falling prices cannot be supported (or even slowed down significantly) by just Singaporeans only.
 
 
Looks like the myth or mystery cannot be clarified.Are normal Singaporeans really rich? Can they really buy properties as though going to supermarket? Do they have the cash to splash?My opinion is not.Heartlander what say you?

Maybe i rephrase the topic question a bit so that the sensitive ones wont feel so upset.
 
If property drops 20% , who in MCF will and can buy an investment property of at least $1.5mil, taking all cooling measures remain status quo.

 
I think many has mis-interpreted your first thread. I believe you are asking how much does one willing to fork out to buy a property now that price has start to soften. And NOT how much cash does MCF'er have in its piggy.

Looks like the myth or mystery cannot be clarified.
 
Are normal Singaporeans really rich? Can they really buy properties as though going to supermarket? Do they have the cash to splash?
 
My opinion is not.
Heartlander what say you?

Sorry my circle of friends and relatives are really heartlander type, hardly got $1mil in cash to splurge one. If you always spend your weekends in country clubs, then different story lah.

My simple question is - is not one a sub-set of another?

I know your intention is good, but we all know not many will contribute and put true figures down. Simply put, the well-off ones will worry about being labelled hao lian, while the poorer ones will risk being look-down. Agree or not?

I would get one. Either drop of price with existing CM, or removal of ABSS. Which of these 2 happening, would buy liao.

That's why I say...
 
All these Singaporeans kow peh kow bu about high private property prices.
 
When the prices drop, they got money to buy or not?  If bank don't want to lend, lagi no money to buy lah!
 
So all this kow peh kow bu is pointless.  Price go up, no money to buy, price go down, lagi no money to buy cos the bank dun wan to lend in times of economic crisis.
 
Now that HDB COV drop to negative and valuations will soon follow.  Those hoping to upgrade to private property, who are usually the same ones who complained private properties too high priced because they want to buy cheap cheap, I ask you whether now you feel SONG BOH?   [laugh] 
 
btw, to stay on topic of this thread, all the cash I have is about $8,888 lah.... enough to buy one second hand Rolex Submariner!   :D

When is it coming? If drop too drastic maybe buy share first.. Just liquidate some more share holding last week.. Left very little still in market. Now waiting and waiting.
 
District 11. Around 1.8 to 2.. Can't afford more as can't stomach too much loan

Would like to think so, but seemed that many sub 1m property taken up, even ulu-er plc like geylang. So stretching their limits since property can appreciate?

$1800 total cpf contribution or just into ordinary account? 
fixed pay + variable commission? Got cap one.
 
If fixed pay.. even if earning 100k per month, only 5k got cpf..

$1800 = max cpf contribution for monthly salary (exclude bonus)
 
self = 20% x $5000 (cap) = $1000
employer = 16% x $5000 (cap) = $800
 
another saying, work 2 years ... salary is way above $5000 liao
hence, another 2 years ... salary is no $20k no talk la

Told T2 son not to show off their father wealth online by commenting this guy 
 
 
http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/singaporeseen/this-urban-jungle/man-boasts-that-20000-is-half-his-monthly-salary-and-gets-rebuked-by-spore
 
 
Man boasts that $20,000 is half his monthly salary -- and gets slammed by S'pore millionaire a.k.a T2
 

A man who boasted about how $20,000 was only just half of his monthly salary on Facebook has received flak from netizens -- including the son of a Singaporean millionaire.
The man's comment was made in response to a news report about a new law, in which travellers will be required to make a declaration if the money they carry in or out of Singapore exceeds S$20,000 from Sep 1 onwards.
"My half month salary", he had written about the sum of money.
His comment, in turn, drew criticism from other users who felt that he was unnecessarily flaunting his wealth in public.
One such user was apparently the son of a Singaporean multi-millionaire.
Stomper Joe had came across the Facebook thread in question and alerted Stomp to it. He wrote:
"This arrogant Singaporean has gotten the attention of many Singaporeans online after making a cocky comment online.
"His comment came under heavy criticism, even by one of Singapore's "Rich Kids". He is a patriotic Singaporean and the son of a multi-millionaire, known for his patriotic comments on Instagram".
Pointing out that there will always be someone richer than you, the millionaire's son said:
"I'm laughing simply because you think it's impressive to earn $20K a month.
"Rich people don't publicise their salaries online."

Don't have much at home, honestly... cos money at home won't earn any interest, no matter how low the interest is now.
Don't believe all the banks will be down at the same time, though can't deny that there may be a chance if the telecom is down and it affect the ATMs 
When the telecom network is down, no online transactions, no ATMs, banks can't work, guess the richest ppl will also become "poor" for that short frame of time

Roughly 1-2kg I think Haha don't really know the weight. A few boxes which I intend to keep for my future generation.
 
Coz I find them lesser and lesser and also gone are marbles and open fields for playing soccer or just running around. Used to spend time catching grass hoppers,  tadpoles ,spiders and many more. Now kids only know candy crush like games and Facebook on their sorry life's on every minute event.
 
Kids nowadays only know android iPad iPhone etc etc,  soon they will be asking why are people burning paper?  
 
In which soon the Japanese and the Europeans would be burning their hell notes the same way Zimbabwe did. The risk of fiak currency is too high currently.

Household expenditure (S$)


[sINGAPORE] Households in Singapore are earning more than they are spending, a new government survey released on Thursday has found.
The latest Household Expenditure Survey (HES) by the Department of Statistics (DOS) also found that average monthly household incomes have gone up across the board, with the bottom 20 per cent of families registering the largest gains.
This survey, the 10th in Singapore's history, is carried out every five years. For this latest report, the national statistical authority interviewed 8,575 Singaporean and permanent resident households from October 2012 to September 2013.
The results showed that the average monthly household income from all sources was S$10,503, up from S$8,105 in the previous survey five years ago.
This is an increase of 5.3 per cent per annum in nominal terms; the rise outpaced inflation, which averaged 3.1 per cent a year between 2008 and 2013.
The DOS' figures do not account for inflation.
Households in the bottom fifth enjoyed the largest income growth. Their average income grew by 6.6 per cent a year over the last five years to S$2,022, while those in the top fifth grew their incomes at a rate of just 4.7 per cent a year.
Across housing types, those in HDB flats experienced higher annual income growth (5.2 per cent) between 2007/08 and 2012/13; those living in condominiums and apartments had increases of 3.6 per cent, and those in landed homes, 4.2 per cent.
Income from employment accounted for 79 per cent of total household income from all sources. Business income contributed 11 per cent, and income from non-work sources such as rental and investments, 10 per cent.
The average amount spent by households was S$4,724 last year, compared to S$3,809 five years ago. This worked out to an annual increase of 4.4 per cent.
The DOS attributed this increase partly to households consuming better quality and higher-end products and services.
Housing, food and transport accounted for the largest shares of household expenditure across the income groups. Collectively, they made up 65 per cent of monthly household expenditure on average, up from 64 per cent in 2007/08 and 61 per cent in 2002/03.
Households here are spending more when it comes to eating out. While meals at hawker centres and food courts continued to make up the bulk of their expenses in this category, the DOS found that the share of spending in restaurants, cafes and pubs has crept up over the last decade.
The average expenditure on transport also rose, from S$700 a month in 2007/08 to S$810 in 2012/13. This came mainly from higher expenses on flights and private transport. The cost of taking public transport went up slightly over this period, from S$160 to S$170.
The survey also pointed to an improvement in standards of living in Singapore; more households now own consumer goods such as mobile phones, LCD television sets and personal computers.
The first HES was undertaken in 1956/57 and covered only the urban area in Singapore. The second survey, which was country- wide, was done in 1972/73. Since then, the HES has been carried out every five years.
The results are used for expenditure and income studies, as well as to update the weighting pattern and the basket of goods and services for the compilation of the Consumer Price Index.

Average S'porean household now earning $10K: survey 
 

Sep 19, 2014
 
Singaporean households are now earning and spending more compared to five years ago, according to new findings from the Department of Statistics’ household expenditure survey.
The average monthly household income in 2012/2013 was $10,500, and households spent an average of $4,720 a month on goods and services during the period.
Comparatively, the average Singaporean household earned $8,110 and spent $3,810 on a monthly basis in 2007/2008.
The study found that household income had climbed faster than household expenditure over the period, with average monthly household income rising by 5.3 percent per annum while the average household expenditure rose by a lower 4.4 percent per annum.
Households across all income groups recorded income growth over this period. Those in the lowest to middle income brackets saw income levels increase by 6.1 to 6.6 percent per annum, while households in the lowest 20 percent also experienced significantly faster income growth between 2007/2008 and 2012/2013 than in the earlier five-year period from 2002/2003 to 2007/2008.
Across housing types, households living in HDB flats reported higher annual income growth of 5.2 percent during the period, compared to those in condominiums and other apartments (3.6 percent) and landed properties (4.2 percent).
Housing, food and transport accounted for the largest shares of household expenditure for all income groups in 2012/2013. Collectively, they contributed to 65 percent of monthly household expenditure on average, up from 64 percent in 2007/2008 and 61 percent in 2002/2003.
The survey’s findings were drawn from 11,050 households between October 2012 and September 2013.
The full report can be accessed here.

知足常乐 my friend. If you are contented with that amt of cash and live within your means, you will be happier than those with $10m cash and messed up families staying in large houses and driving expensive cars.. I know of ppl who are wealthy but damn stingy.. Dun even contribute to charity or worth causes. I know of below average income people who contribute their time to volunteer at aged homes and buy foodstuff on regular basis for the old folks.. These ppl I respect. Money is always secondary. Most impt is to have a happy and contented family, then u will be truly happy..

IMHO all this talk about the average singaporean being rich is mostly propaganda.  Most of the govt generated stats base their wealth calculations to include the house and CPF.  As we all know Singapore is now the most expensive city in the world so if you count the home and CPF the results are very misleading.
 
The government also likes to repeat GDP/GNP growth again and again but very little of this "growth" translates into actual benefits for the guys on the street. So wtf if GDP?GNP go up 5%? Do I get a 5% pay hike? No.  Instead I see MRT, ERP, School Fees etc all go up.  I dont need an economics degree to see this.
 
The valuations also do not take into account the massive cost of buying and owning a house and car, daily ERP, COE and other hidden taxes. 
 
Once you factor all the above in and do a real inflation and real income adjusted review,  the real picture is quite somber. 
 
But at least they got one thing right, we dont have enough to retire on.  By "We" I mean us, the average singaporeans.  Infact the local spin media contradict themselves daily.  On the one hand they tell us how "wealthy" we are but on the other hand they say we dont have enough in our CPF to retire on and dont trust us with managing our own retirement money.  And then they tell us to make even more babies when there is not enough CPF for own retirement?  Hello if i cant even feed myself and safe fer retirement how am i going to support another mouth?

Thank you for contributing to this exercise.
It can help everyone gauge if they should buy properties or not.
No fool proof, so use information at your own risk, hor....heh

The bank people also ask such question.

Thank you for that clarification sir.  I was always under the delusion and misconception that how much I can give is directly correlated and dependant on how much I have in the first place.
 
The simple logic being that I cannot give what I do not have, and I cannot give more than what I own.
 
But I now realise that I was wrong, that I have sinned, that I am bad and shallow and have "bad values"
 
I seek the kind forgiveness of the bros here for the errors in my way.
 
Agree. It's not abt how much u have... It's how much u give..

There was a HKG news recently of an birrionaire was celebrating his 50th Birthday and was on the stage for the champagne popping event. The champagne popped and the cork hit him on his head and he fell down. 
Long story short, he died.
It's a sad story for a man who made Birrions but didn't get a chance to enjoy it. 
 
What good for a man to gain the whole world but forfeits his soul?
 
Health is wealth.
Family union is happiness
Money in the bank is not yours until you spend it.
Be wise to spend your money, it is confirmed blessed to give than to receive.

Giving can be in many forms, to your family or strangers, people in need and is not only in monetary terms. it can come it the form of free tuition to children from low income families. Giving can be time spent with your parents / grandparents, spending time with them bring them out for a good meal, help extended to your neighbors in fixing a broken pipes or to sibling to look after their young kids... 
 
Live within your means and give within your means. A healthy body is much more important than a healthy bank account. I have a friend who has many properties and watches but is down with cancer and final stage... very say for him...

exactly, i say and i say again ONLY FOR MYSELF here:. 
 
i have a limited lifespan, after a renal transplant.  How am I to calibrate how much savings I should ahve?  ALthough i have made my will into a sort of trust fund after I go, why should i live like a beggar in order to fulfil the needs of others after I go?
 
Of course, i do not live foolishly and lavishly, but i'm LIVING MY LIFE. i have a decent car, club, etc, and i am living and enjoying my life with my loved ones.  That said, i am single and yes, although i am attached, how much longer do i have.  I do have savings, but not like what @throttle2 has which is $700k.  
 
Point i am making is plan, but not to the extent of living the life of a pauper.  Also not to go the extent of being heavily in debt.  Strike a balance, tht is key

Average household income says NOTHING. What if there are 2 families cramming in the flat because they cannot afford their own flat?
 
Show us the per-capita income by dwelling type, that's the real deal.

How much are S'poreans saving?
A lot, it seems, with savings rates of 33% to 69% as per latest data. But about 25 percentage points is probably due to CPF

After crunching the numbers, the typical household probably saves S$1,500 in cash every month, while the above-average household by income can put about S$3,000 in the bank.



How Singapore earns and spends


ONE of the regular messages from this column on managing one's personal finances is to track one's expenses religiously.
That is, to painstakingly catalogue how much of your money goes into food, transport, clothing, healthcare and so on. But have you ever wondered how the entire nation spends?
A treasure trove of data was published last Thursday when the Department of Statistics released the results of its latest Household Expenditure Survey, held once every five years.
What are its implications for the investor?
The data can prove useful in benchmarking yourself against the population to see where you stand in saving and spending.
The survey ranked households according to how much they earn and dissected their expenditures accordingly.
From the charts, one can see that the lowest fifth of households spends more than what they earn. That puts them in a deficit every month. The other four fifths of households are in surplus every month.
Interestingly, this group is increasingly spending a smaller chunk of their income over time. By implication, they are saving more over time. Similarly, the deficit of the lowest fifth of households as a proportion of their income is narrowing over time.
We can calculate a "savings rate" based on how much is left over after spending, as a proportion of one's original income.
For example, in 2002-3, the fifth of households that is second from the bottom, the 21st to 40th percentiles, saved 20 per cent of their income. In 2012-3, they were saving about a third.
The top fifth of households saved 63 per cent of their income in 2002-3. In 2012-3, they were saving a whopping 69 per cent.
Even the 41st-60th percentile, a group that is solidly middle class, appear to be saving 44 per cent of their income every month.
The numbers are puzzling, given the vociferous complaints about how Singapore has become a much more expensive place to live in.
Are expenditures understated?
The survey looks extremely rigorous. It covered over 8,000 households in Singapore, and spanned over a year to ensure spending patterns during festivals and holidays were captured. Mortgage payments and renovation expenses were also included. Ad-hoc spending on big-ticket items like holidays, weddings and funerals were also included to minimise under-reporting of expenditure. The latest survey even included a section on spending on Internet purchases.
However, non-consumption expenditure such as loan principal repayments, income taxes, and the purchase of houses - a major distortional figure - were not included.
Income taxes are not significant for most of the population except for the highest earners. So the top fifth of the population probably save less than they appear to.
Are income numbers giving a wrong impression then? These include employer Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions to give a fairer reflection of what constitutes income.
Money in the CPF, however, is not perceived to hold the same value as money in the bank because there are restrictions on how one can spend that money. Let's say that we just want to figure out how much money is going into the bank every month, excluding money going into CPF accounts. Once we exclude employer CPF contributions from our definition of "savings", savings rates fall to 24 per cent to 43 per cent for the middle three-fifths of the population.
We then take out employee CPF contributions, which can be up to 20 per cent of one's income. If we assume that the maximum 20 per cent is put into CPF, we are left with more modest savings rates of 9 to 28 per cent for the middle three-fifths.
In other words, if your household belongs to the middle three-fifths of the population by income and the household saves anywhere from 10 to 30 per cent of its total income in cash, it is saving at a rate comparable to its peers.
In essence, enforced CPF contributions probably contribute another 25 percentage points to one's savings rate.
After crunching the numbers, the typical household probably saves S$1,500 in cash every month, while the above-average household by income can put about S$3,000 in the bank. Money for the top fifth of households, meanwhile, is probably piling up at the rate of about S$10,000 a month.
For the rest of the population, the CPF system is helping them save a considerable amount of money - equal to or more than what they can leave in a bank.
Most people will probably not see their bank balances grow at the same rate as CPF's, leading to worries about not making ends meet and angst about how much money is locked away in the provident fund.
But seen from the outside - with Americans typically having personal savings rates of just 5 per cent - Singaporeans aren't doing too badly on the savings front.

Interesting Story today - it quickly reminds me only to judge myself and not others when comparing wealth.
 
The "poor" looking road sweeper or toilet cleaner or table wiper may be richer than me. Just because they don't have private banking services doesn't mean they don't have plenty of money. There are many whom I know drive expensive cars and stay in private properties (bungalow), but have hardly any asset but lots of debt. Of course, there are those who are truly rich and flaunt their wealth around.
 
 
Being cynical, look if everything was to go to plans, the tour guide would have been $40million in wealth
 
 
The bottom line of the story is:
it doesn't matter what you do, you can be rich too if you plan.
 
 
A toilet cleaner's key to richesMonday, September 22, 2014 {C}		As prices of small and medium-size homes soar, real estate experts fear an eventual crash. But a top manager of a leading developer believes prices may still rise another 5 percent.
The subject also came up when I was having tea with relatives. We were saying there were scarcely any urban homes left below HK$3 million these days, when the plainly dressed couple sitting on the other side of our shared table joined in the conversation.
They said they had just bought a flat of 300 square feet at HK$2.8 million in Sham Shui Po for their son. Why then would ordinary folk like this couple take the bold move of making a purchase when experts are apprehensive?
They told us they had actually made big money from property investments, netting HK$3 million from a Sai Kung property two years ago. And as they were not first-time buyers, they had to pay double duty.
They further revealed that they also owned two units in an old Tsim Sha Tsui residential block, one of which was bought from Fook Lam Moon founder Chui Fuk-chuen.
They then received an offer from someone who said he represented Henry Ng Chun-for, then chairman of Henry Group Holdings, to acquire the building.
The representative booked a room at a restaurant in the vicinity and invited flat owners to tea every day in order to convince them to sell. The owners gladly enjoyed his treat, but none were interested in parting with their properties including the couple as they intended to hold their units.
The coupl
    
e couldn't hide their joy when talking about having bought properties cheaply. From what I could gather, they owned at least four.
When they bought their first one, the husband was a house painter, while the wife was a janitor, responsible for cleaning toilets.
They leverage on income from one property to finance the next acquisition, reaping a fortune over the years. Now they have a diverse portfolio of real estate, stocks and foreign exchange, but they still go to work every day, happy to keep busy. Siu Sai-wo is publisher of Sing Tao Daily

Giving can be in many forms, to your family or strangers, people in need and is not only in monetary terms. it can come it the form of free tuition to children from low income families. Giving can be time spent with your parents / grandparents, spending time with them bring them out for a good meal, help extended to your neighbors in fixing a broken pipes or to sibling to look after their young kids... 
 
Live within your means and give within your means. A healthy body is much more important than a healthy bank account. I have a friend who has many properties and watches but is down with cancer and final stage... very say for him...

 
Its always the case.
 
People who are rich don't have the health to spend it.
 
People who are healthy like me don't have any money to spend.
 
Maybe we need more cooperation in life.
 
People with lots of money and no health to spend it should
 
just pass it to healthy people like me to help spend it for them.
 
Giving can be in many forms and this is one way I can help give.

It's always having cash the more the merrier.. 
 
I'm not rich like a lot of folks here.. Still in debt with housing loan.. My TDSR is around 20%..  My current savings should be able to last 10 years of current expenses for current lifestyle.
 
Working hard like everyone else but at least not struggling for survival and no longer stressed by $$.. 
 
The big part is bec the only depreciating asset I have is my really cheap small car.. So it's not a pain at all.. And another bigger expenses are children preschool which I can easily downgrade if need be.
 
Like most guys, I wanted to drive a nice car but just not there yet to spurge on a swanky 200-300k car.. Anyway life is short, so in the next 1-2 years after I set aside funds for sons' overseas education fee, it's time to just heck care and buy the 10 year lifespan machine in Singapore

Nowadays having mistress can take loan ah? How many years? Whats the interest is? This loan very high risk cos if big wife finds out, the person will go penniless how to payback the loan??

I think its terribly vulgar asking how much cash a person has.
 
Its like asking how much is your salary.
 
But if people really want to know then
 
I keep about $50 cash in my wallet.
 
 

 
I also feel it's terribly vulgar to ask what you keep in your wallet.
 
Except in your case, people would be wondering...
 
...how many condoms do you keep in there?

That's the beauty of being a lesbian
 
we never use those evil things.
 
Those things are so evil I heard in some faiths
 
its a sin to use them and I can well respect that.
 
As a courtesy to the tread title I better stick to the vulgar topic
 
of money and not the divine topic of procreation although
 
procreation is far more interesting.
