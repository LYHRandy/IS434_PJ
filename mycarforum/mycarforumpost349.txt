Afternoon sun?
You wouldn't want your house to be an oven.
Actually,i don't really know. Public transport and shops in abundance would be a plus!

view during day lor... wat to look for? 
 

surrounding.. bad neighhorhood? littering problem? type of neighbors? 
 

afternoon sun direction. 
 

littering problem will also affect ur cloth drying. 
 

dog poo poo or dirty lifts r really no-no, ah loong newsletters, new paint patches, etc. 
 

neighbors, kaypoh ones not so bad, kuai lan ones u may face problem like everitt road.

Dun ever look for a flat which is very inconvenient like very quiet type in term of got to walk very far to find & search for foods when u r hungry. Actually, it is up to individual as some ppls will prefer quieter environment & surroundings while some ppls like to find & search for places whereby it is convenient whereby when u go downstairs of the flat, u can find some shops for groceries & coffeeshop.

Almost buy a EM HDB 5 years ago until I went for the 2nd viewing and it was raining heavily.
 
The rain water splash on the front wooden door until the living room area was completely wet. From there onwards, I look for flat with the corridor a distance from the front door.

In addition to checking of orientation, looking for leaks, ah long harassment records, neighbour etc, get the FEEL when you go viewing. Enter the house and get your 6th sense to FEEL how comfortable you are or the other way round!

This one very important - make sure no heavy vehicle carpark nearby. 
 
Some of those lorries and school buses start their day really early. And they end their day really late sometimes.
 
I'm sure you don't want the roar of big CC engines to disturb your sleep every night and dawn.

just to share,
 
1. look at the paint of the main doors or windows, whether repainted, redone like new? a symton that ah long came before. sometime they tell you they paint just to give a new fresh look, if this case look into the new look inside the house also.
 
2. any person in the family passed away recently for the seller? this may affect the buying decision also. look at the family photos if you are viewing inside. if no old folks still can happening spots their belonging, best have discussion among buyers.
 
3. look around the area or neighbours unit. see got the same symton like new "door paints", this may affect your decision also.
 
others quite normal like amenties, transportation etc come in later.
 
just to share. no flaming. tips from housing agent.

1.Dont listen to whatever agent says..esp crap like last offer xxx,if u want offer xxxx to close,"move in condition"-which turns out like pig sty.
 
2.Don't rush to buy,go view around..i have viewed countless houses till now havnt buy  since staying long term,makesure it satisfies all ur requirements.
 
3.If really like,arrange for another viewing..bring frds,family along..they might see thing you might not.
 
4.If can,wait la..now market overheated,govt oso say.wait till they impose more measures to cool down market.
 
5.Ur budget..dont overstretch urself..
 
good luck..got more 2 say la.from my experiences but share these with u nw.

normally i hear from ppl is they view at diff timings of the day
 
afternoon (sunset time) to see if the unit will be affected
night time to check out for surroundings and environment (quiet? noise level? too dark?)
 
the others to consider includes stuff like condition of the house
- wall (cracks? insect trails?)
- ceiling (wet patches? falling off of dried 'flakes'?)
- water pipes (leaks?)
- the units beside ur viewing if have 
- exterior area outside the flat
 
etc etc etc......
 
 
u planning to re furnish the place?

i don't really look at condition of the resale house, its will be at least of a certain age and many stuff will just wear off and of cause highly that new owner gonna renovate the place and change all wires, pipes and stuff.. a lot of things can be hidden one and most of the time agent will not know its condition..
