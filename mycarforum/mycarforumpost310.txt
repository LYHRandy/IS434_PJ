watch out for the lock in period and penalties and don t focus on just the rate, i have friends whose rates have increased up to 6.5 and southwards while still in their lock in period. 
 
i rather pay middle rate interest and have the option to change should the bank decide to fark with me....then i can tell them to up yours and refinance.

Can anyone advise what is the likely chance of loan approval if a person is jobless at the point of application?
 

Is "having a job" all that matters? 

Or do they take a holistic view on yr financial credibility etc.... ?
 

Appreciate those who works in banks and are in the know of the subject matter give valuable advice. 
 

Thanks!

financial credibility means nothing to the banks .... all they want is proof that you have income to repay your loan ......
 

history is just that .... history ..... get it ?

nowadays,banks are very stringent in loan.but if you have security for them (eg a fully paid-up real property),maybe still got chance.the best is to approach the bank loan officer if you are really sincere in the loan,difficult for fellow Bros here to tell u.good luck!

Thanks to all who have replied. I am hoping that if the loan amount is not large, maybe still got chance, for i have a steady income for the past 5 years (CPF statement). 
 

Is toying with the idea of resigning because very unhappy working in current workplace but may need to apply for a hdb loan in the next few or several months.
 

But i have enough savings to service the monthly instalment for next few years even if not working.
 

Is there any successful cases here though?
 

:-p

Actually my constraint is that in the next several months i won't be able to form a family nucleus yet, so cannot buy flat = apply loan first also no use...
 

But i am really mentally drained from my current job and i really need a break... 
 

if i can, i surely get loan approved first then burn the bridge..

They are looking at steady income.. the saving you have are for show.. it's like borrowing money to put in bank to show you got money. unless the saving is in the same bank and that is being pledged as collateral
 
 

anyway, how much of saving are you talking about vs the loan amt? care to share?

What is your balance loan amount? How much do you have in your CPF?

If your balance loan is not high, did you think of your CPF?

The housing specialist told me i pledged also no use. The amt cannot be used to service the loan. I have not find a flat yet so i have no numbers to provide.
 

But as a really rough estimate, the saving i have is about 3/5 of the loan amt?

I have not devise my strategy yet on how much cash to throw in and how much CPF to put in. No idea on loan amount, but should be 100k or more.

Ya, now i am looking for flat now. I may throw earlier, as long as i still have my last month pay slip for loan application. Really, the payslip is everything to the bank, no payslip, 0 chance, like wat other bros said in here.
 

The housing specialist is empathised enuff to say maybe got 10 - 20 % chance though...

Bank won't care if you have $$ in yr bank account. The $$ in bank can be gone by next day. They can't tell if the $$ is not yrs as well.

Actually i thought we can just apply for the loan first without declaring the property that you intend to purchase. But have to find a house within 1 month upon loan approval.
 

But again, it is only 1 month...

how do you plan to repay the loan?

if you have ways to repay it, then let the bank know. I think that is what bank needed to approve a loan.

Sony and Snowbell,
 

I spoke to UOB. They can do a loan approval in principle, sorry if i got it wrong i can't remember what it is called. I am surprised too. But i didnt ask further on how much to loan when i have not even found a flat etc... because after the loan is approved, i have to find a flat in 1 month which is quite impossible unless i am really lucky.
 

Unless that fellow smoke me, which i see no reason for him to do so...
 

Something new yah? I am taken aback too...

I have mentioned earlier that i intend to use my saving to pay the instalment. It can last me for a few years. But the bank said this is not part of their regulation. I asked if i am able to sort-of draft an agreement with the bank to set aside this amount of saving to pay for the housing instalment and they said again - no. This is like pledging, but still - no.
 

I think they are really cautious.

OCBC last time have this online service for you to check on your loan eligibility.. and that is what they called in principle approval. 
 

anyway, in  conclusion, check with the bank. MCF is a car forum, not a bank forum or even a bank.
