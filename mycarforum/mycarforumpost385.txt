People living in the north of Singapore are sicker at a younger age.
In the north and central areas of Singapore, 20 per cent of public healthcare patients account for 84 per cent of healthcare expenditure.
But patients in the north are, on average, six years younger than those in the central areas.
The mean age among "top users" - the top 20 per cent of patients who account for the highest healthcare usage - is 44.4 years in central areas but 38.2 years in the north.
This came as an unpleasant surprise to Professor Philip Choo, group chief executive officer of the National Healthcare Group (NHG).
NHG used to look after the central region of Singapore, overseeing public healthcare institutions including Tan Tock Seng Hospital and the National Skin Centre.
 
 
When public healthcare was reconfigured into three clusters two years ago, NHG took on the north as well, overseeing institutions like Khoo Teck Puat and Yishun Community Hospital. 
The local population under NHG care grew by 50 per cent from one million to more than 1.5 million people.
When public healthcare was reconfigured into three clusters two years ago, the local population under NHG care grew by 50 per cent from one million to more than 1.5 million people.
That was when Prof Choo discovered that healthcare usage appeared high in the north even though the general population there was younger.

I wonder how the south compares.. aren’t there ports and such?
I actually thought the central area might be the best. Reservoirs and the Bukit Timah area..

nobody ask why?
is it because population in the north are generally younger? or,
majority in the north are  of a specific race , as a result, their health is influence by their diet or lifestyle?
any study and correlation in air quality? 
what else  ?

It could just be the population there is younger, and the ppl there prefer to use public healthcare instead of the private GPs. 
 
I stay in the West, and i cannot remember when was the last time any of my family members visited a polyclinic. Is always the private GP near our home, and very urgent at night is 24 hrs A&E. But how often do one use the 24hrs A&E? 
 
They sld at least compare it against the 2 other clusters as well I think, and good to check on the visiting rate to GPs of the other clusters as well. 
 
I think its not a fair statement to say those living in the north are less healthy base on one record alone.

There is a direction call South-West...     
 
I dont know if ang moh got further break it down, but the Chinese has 西南偏西 (south-west closer west)，西南偏南 (south-west closer south). 
 
So it is not exactly 4 zones only...

Living in the north does make one’s body generates more siao Now, with the body generating so much siao, and no where for the siao to go, it can only go north - siao Chong nao
When it becums severe enough, the guy will becum siao Lang and start looking for poor innnocent pussies in Yishun to vent all their siaoness
 
Knowing the dangers of living in the north 
I have learnt the art of expelling siao regularly in order to maintain a delicate balance of siao and no siao
 
You see: with so much siao that I have to regularly expel, how can I not dee the siao a bit

further down to jurong and tuas yes there are many heavy industries. 
 
move in to Bukit batok vicinity they are building the brickland (don't know what green estate). give them 10 years that place will be like punggol and seng Kang. if I didn't hear wrongly kranji stretch (industrial park) will be develope onto another mega estate as well.

I think most of the heavy industry already moved out of singapore, nearest will be JB. The only 'heavy' types are ship building, container,  etc. These not much polluting compared to paint and chemical manufacturing type.

West coast stretch looks like not bad, but traffic there quite high on the west coast highway le?! Pandan garden area seems too near to the industrial area. Stay there always can smell the bread smell.

It's a small area that makes for good living..
I hinted it to someone who was asking recently, but kenna labelled agent and had to spoon fed..
 
But there are areas which are quiet, well connected by train, roads and buses, near Vivo and a hawker centre, food places and around 13-1400 psf... YMMV... 
 
But if you want new, then it's going to be 18-1900 psf... 
Good air, good 'wind-water' too.. (Kent Ridge Hill behind you, and the sea in front)..

Actually not only the north but just generally at the edges of singapore especially where there are industrials (B2) or shipping ports. Just avoid these 2 types and also make sure your area have tons of tall trees. More trees surrounding means less people also, which in turn generate lesser heat. more trees also cool the area.
