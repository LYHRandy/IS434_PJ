"...the size of new HDB flats today is still very comfortable"
 

This woman is either living in the woods or delusional...
 

So we are heading the way HK is presently doing now?
 

Whatever happen to the Swiss standard of living our beloved ESM promised during his term as PM?
 

Does Swiss folks live in small little pigeon holes? 
 

If our dear govt continue to build smaller and smaller flats, I guess by the time my kids are applying flats with their spouses in the near future, it may cost them each S$1m to buy a new 4-room unit of 50sqm...

HDB is right to build smaller flats  

Published on Dec 8, 2011 
 

I AM dismayed by the reactions criticising shrinking HDB flat sizes ('New flats' by Mr Yip Wai Hong on Nov 15; 'Little space' by Ms Karen Lee, 'S'pore can do better than Hong Kong' by Madam Tham Pui Ying and 'Why smaller isn't the way to go' by Ms Lim Wan Keng; all Nov 29). 
 

The small size of current HDB flats is one reason cited by couples for refusing to have more children and for their poor quality of life. 
 

Previous generations did not link the size of their flats with having the number of children they wanted.
 

Even living in a one-room HDB flat did not deter couples from having more than three children. 
 

It is unfortunate if the size of a flat now determines the size of a family.
 

There is also a sad trend that fewer married couples want to live with their parents. 
 

It does not make economic sense to build bigger flats when the family unit is shrinking. 
 

Having said that, the size of new HDB flats today is still very comfortable. 
 

As Housing Board figures have shown, the floor space per person is higher. HDB flats are also equipped with good sanitation, amenities and infrastructure. 
 

When it comes to improving the quality of life, Singaporeans should look into bonding with their families and neighbours, and creating a better living environment. 
 

Unless the trend of shrinking family units can be reversed, Singaporeans should not complain about shrinking flat sizes.

In a shrunken unit, quality of life is indeed lowered. The rooms in new flats are small and when a double bed and wardrobe is put in, the room is only left with walking space, a table can't even be put in. Kids also need a bigger area to move around and play in the house and their own privacy when they grow up. Smaller unit is only good from 2 points of views - easier to clean and more money for the gov.
 

HDB is trying to benefit from this. In the past, you can see mega carparks that take up a lot of land and some walking distance away from the blocks in mature estates. Now, the land allocated for carparks are smaller and MSCPs are built, almost beside the blocks. Blocks are also built higher, so why can't they remain the same size? Not forgetting, blocks are now spaced more closely than in the past.

The irony is that whilst the govt justify for smaller unit size in hdb, they come down on shoebox development. If the govt does it, it's worth paying high prices and cosy up in small spaces. If the private developers do it, it's unethical and price points do not represent the market condition... So hdb is right in that people have shrinking need for space due to lower birth but shoebox is not the way in private development? Or govt is saying everyone is to buy the smaller size hdb flat and leave the private property to the rich and elite few who needs lots more space even with the same headcount or less.

Shoebox units exists because the developer bought the land that is too small to build normal sized units.

I agree with her view points esp the 1-Room still can have 3 kids.

Don't blame the space, its a choice.  If you blame everything else for not having babies, its not the environment, its the couple's prioriity and mindset.

The thing I don't agree is Age-De-Bee if reduce the size should reduce the PRICE.

To compound the issue, a House Shelter(HS) is built in each flat, taking up considerable space.
 

The solution - build a common HS outside the flats ie. making use of the staircases...

On the contrary, mkt works the other way round...the smaller the size the more expensive will be psf..so if can squeeze more money out of psf, why build big hse? This is the way those smart civil servants r thinking...their KPI esp those managing rev is to squeeze out more money to justify their presence n that they hv did their job well..if Smaller flats = smaller family..then HDB shld consider building bigger flats to encourage bigger family... 
 

There is no correlation between the size of the flat n family size... it is rather a preference and affordability... want to talk last time...during kampong time...ppl have a big patio space...so if u want quality...then make sure u give sporean a big patio or a back yard...   which is impossible......dream on....

Smaller doesn't mean cheaper? Smaller simply means material cost is cheaper per unit, hence more profit margin. 
 

So which part of HDB is right to build smaller flats?

When it comes to improving the quality of life, Singaporeans should look into bonding with their families and neighbours, and creating a better living environment.(   with our quotas system everyone is self-centered,what you expect?)

Do not mix philosophy with economics. In determining what is affordable and reasonable the last thing we want to bring in is 有情饮水饱 kind of argument. Hdb flats are getting smaller yet more expensive. If it's not affordable how to have other perspectives such as family? So go back to higher pay but govt wants to keep cost low so as to be competitive. Yet ministers' pay is in millions are climbing. End up they need to up all the revenue in direct and indirect taxes. So you save little and you can't afford a lot of things including kids. Btw, why still collect Erp in evening when you want people to go home to procreate? Perhaps the end result is best represented by Geylang's glory... Tonnes of rubber disposed each day... Millions of sperm died instead of becoming Singaporeans... We simply love PAP! Well done! Collect your millions pls.

Better still: 
 

Straits Time  + HDB policy?...How innovative government's propaganda can get?
 

Smaller HDB apartment?  I foresee this is the side-effect of Singapore population getting out-of-control.
 

We now see gov going around acquiring lands in the name of expressway, road buildings  etc etc (removal of Brownhill Cemetery to Rochor Centre).. in the expense of Singaporean history, living standard and even the size of their public apartment.

How small is small?
 

If we take HK's space standard eg masterbed room (not the highend but average pte condos) and use it here, we get: after putting in a double bed (with two sides butt against the wall), we could just about squeeze ourselves on the other 'free' sides to move around the room, forget about dressing table n desk.....  
 

Living/dining room: one small size 2 or 3 seater sofa, one 3/4 seat dinning stable, and that's all.
 

Kitchen: you put two persons in there, now more shoulder room left.
 

HDB has not reached HK standard yet, but likely to do so coz they do not say they wont.
 

More good years to come!!!
 

There are other ways to put 6-7m on this island, pigoen-hole HDB is not the only one. Eg more 40-50 sty flats and this will double the number of HDB flats. Should be enough to accommodate 6-7m population. Bigger question: do we really need more than 6-7m population? Is the dog chasing its tail?

The top brass don't feel and see it why would they do something about it other than lip service. They either drive or get ferry from point to point. Public transport system to them is a blueprint and some huge numbers that is deemed as they have done their job and next to levying more to regulate they do not have any better ideas. They live in big houses and a hdb 3 room flat is at best the size of their maid's room. To them, they only look at the big numbers in hdb 5, 4, 3 rooms they built, why would they bother about how much privacy space you need to play catching when you procreate? You make it mandatory for transport minister, smrt and bus service ceo to travel by public transport during their term you might get better result. You make mnd, hdb and even ura chief stay in new 3room flat during their tenure in office and see what happens to public housing. When the sh!t hits the fence you will see real improvement to the lives of the voters that gave them their million dollar salary. The govt employs a large portion of workforce. Wanna solve transport issue? Change public service office hours to 10am to 7pm and you take out a large portion of commuters out of peak hours. Wanna solve housing issue to make it more affordable and more spacious? Ask SLA to give the land free to hdb, that is afterall left pocket right pocket, and cost of housing drops 30%. Build higher and bigger units with the new budget and you get affordable and bigger size units. They are scholars, don't take them Harvard degrees to see the solutions. But why are they not doing it? Cos housing is tied to cpf, you go figure why they want to drain your cpf via housing. As for peak hour jam, why solve it with a stroke of the pen when you can justify Erp charges that adds to their millio dollar salary. Cheers...

The land of Singapore keep increasing through land reclaimation, and don't forget, older flats build on vast land plots are forced to tear down with more blocks squeezed in and higher up in the sky. 
 

If you have noticed also, the height of new flats are lower (about 30 cm)  than older flats. So, imagine how much materials they have saved and how many more levels more they have built taking into consideration of urban planning and flight restrictions.

Is this good for the society? are these KPI sustainable?
 

Any recourse?



 

Hmmm....u wan to talk abt KPI...generally it depends on r u a farmer or scholar..if u farmer then u will go all way out to prove ur worth but if u scholar...it would be the midas effect...
 

As for whether is it good for the society..it can only be determined thru GE...will hv to wait for the next few 5 yrs to conclude this but this trend is irreversible...
 

For all corporate world...KPI will only be adjusted under special circumstances...usually KPI is heading north rather than south but it also depends on how u wld like to define KPIs... Spore is run like an inc so KPI wld generally be wealth growing...for the past decade or so..i hv been hearing this over n over again...like a broken recorder... without KPI...then ppl lack in direction..guess sporeans r trained to be goal getters..if u cant get it..u r out of the race..this is reality... 
 

Any recourse? Wat recourse do u want? Take out whatever in our coffer, open up and share genuinely w the public?   Believe everyone is looking forward to that day.....but dream only lah...

As for peak hour jam, why solve it with a stroke of the pen when you can justify Erp charges that adds to their millio dollar salary. Cheers...




Truly Lip Service....... 
 

note: not just the chiefs, but those who are involved in decisions making, 2-3 levels below the chiefs, most likely are not living in HDB 3/4 room flats............

Hmmm....u wan to talk abt KPI...generally it depends on r u a farmer or scholar..if u farmer then u will go all way out to prove ur worth but if u scholar...it would be the midas effect...
 

As for whether is it good for the society..it can only be determined thru GE...will hv to wait for the next few 5 yrs to conclude this but this trend is irreversible...
 

For all corporate world...KPI will only be adjusted under special circumstances...usually KPI is heading north rather than south but it also depends on how u wld like to define KPIs... Spore is run like an inc so KPI wld generally be wealth growing...for the past decade or so..i hv been hearing this over n over again...like a broken recorder... without KPI...then ppl lack in direction..guess sporeans r trained to be goal getters..if u cant get it..u r out of the race..this is reality... 



Any recourse? Wat recourse do u want? Take out whatever in our coffer, open up and share genuinely w the public?   Believe everyone is looking forward to that day.....but dream only lah... 




Next GE

"...the size of new HDB flats today is still very comfortable"
 

This woman is either living in the woods or delusional...
 

So we are heading the way HK is presently doing now?
 

Whatever happen to the Swiss standard of living our beloved ESM promised during his term as PM?
 

Does Swiss folks live in small little pigeon holes? 
 

If our dear govt continue to build smaller and smaller flats, I guess by the time my kids are applying flats with their spouses in the near future, it may cost them each S$1m to buy a new 4-room unit of 50sqm...

HDB is right to build smaller flats  

Published on Dec 8, 2011 
 

I AM dismayed by the reactions criticising shrinking HDB flat sizes ('New flats' by Mr Yip Wai Hong on Nov 15; 'Little space' by Ms Karen Lee, 'S'pore can do better than Hong Kong' by Madam Tham Pui Ying and 'Why smaller isn't the way to go' by Ms Lim Wan Keng; all Nov 29). 
 

The small size of current HDB flats is one reason cited by couples for refusing to have more children and for their poor quality of life. 
 

Previous generations did not link the size of their flats with having the number of children they wanted.
 

Even living in a one-room HDB flat did not deter couples from having more than three children. 
 

It is unfortunate if the size of a flat now determines the size of a family.
 

There is also a sad trend that fewer married couples want to live with their parents. 
 

It does not make economic sense to build bigger flats when the family unit is shrinking. 
 

Having said that, the size of new HDB flats today is still very comfortable. 
 

As Housing Board figures have shown, the floor space per person is higher. HDB flats are also equipped with good sanitation, amenities and infrastructure. 
 

When it comes to improving the quality of life, Singaporeans should look into bonding with their families and neighbours, and creating a better living environment. 
 

Unless the trend of shrinking family units can be reversed, Singaporeans should not complain about shrinking flat sizes.

The top brass don't feel and see it why would they do something about it other than lip service. They either drive or get ferry from point to point. Public transport system to them is a blueprint and some huge numbers that is deemed as they have done their job and next to levying more to regulate they do not have any better ideas. They live in big houses and a hdb 3 room flat is at best the size of their maid's room. To them, they only look at the big numbers in hdb 5, 4, 3 rooms they built, why would they bother about how much privacy space you need to play catching when you procreate? You make it mandatory for transport minister, smrt and bus service ceo to travel by public transport during their term you might get better result. You make mnd, hdb and even ura chief stay in new 3room flat during their tenure in office and see what happens to public housing. When the sh!t hits the fence you will see real improvement to the lives of the voters that gave them their million dollar salary. The govt employs a large portion of workforce. Wanna solve transport issue? Change public service office hours to 10am to 7pm and you take out a large portion of commuters out of peak hours. Wanna solve housing issue to make it more affordable and more spacious? Ask SLA to give the land free to hdb, that is afterall left pocket right pocket, and cost of housing drops 30%. Build higher and bigger units with the new budget and you get affordable and bigger size units. They are scholars, don't take them Harvard degrees to see the solutions. But why are they not doing it? Cos housing is tied to cpf, you go figure why they want to drain your cpf via housing. As for peak hour jam, why solve it with a stroke of the pen when you can justify Erp charges that adds to their millio dollar salary. Cheers...

im really curious to know.
 

how small is a HK flat?



 

Public housing:

Public Rental Housing (called Estates) have flats usually 20-60 sqm, but a small number of flats are even 8 sqm (internal floor area).

Home Ownership Scheme (usually called Courts) have flats usually 30-60 sqm but a small number of flats are 19 sqm (saleable floor area).

Private Sector Participation Scheme (usually called Garden or Terrace) have flats usually 35-70 sqm (saleable floor area).

Tenants Purchase Scheme are usually 20-65 sqm, but a small number of flats are even 8 sqm (which floor area?).

I agree with her view points esp the 1-Room still can have 3 kids.

Don't blame the space, its a choice.  If you blame everything else for not having babies, its not the environment, its the couple's prioriity and mindset.

The thing I don't agree is Age-De-Bee if reduce the size should reduce the PRICE.



 

i'm pretty certain you are single and not married

anybody with children will know that children need space to run around and parents need the space for themselves and some alone time without the children running around
 

your children will not want to run in circles and if there isn't enough space for children to run around they'll come disturbing you day and night

actually, there's truth in what this woman wrote. no point building 1300 sqft 5-room flats for 3-member families if govt see that is going to be the trend.
 

so the way to resolve this issue is to be transparent about HDB profits. nobody wants to be paying more for less when there's no other viable alternative.

For this Mdm Koh Siok Hwee, perhaps she should reveal what kinda of house she's currently living in before she make such comments... Best is for this type of ppl to live the talk rather than talk the c_ck..
