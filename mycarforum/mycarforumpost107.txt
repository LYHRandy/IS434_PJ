High debt-GDP ratio could hurt in face of global slowdown

Bylivia yap 
 

THE rapid rise in household debt here, coming amid the uncertainty of global financial markets, has been red-flagged. 
 

Kelvin Tay, the regional chief investment officer for the Southern Asia-Pacific for UBS Wealth Management, said the high household debt levels, coupled with high property prices, could make Singapore vulnerable to a rise in unemployment, a reduction in incomes and asset deflation if a slowdown in global economic markets happens.
 

Singapore's household debt - total consumer loans of Domestic Banking Units - stood at 279 per cent of the total gross domestic product in the first quarter of this year, up from 177 per cent in the corresponding quarter in 2007.
 

The 279 per cent figure is even higher than the 198 per cent recorded in the first quarter of 2009, after the 2008 financial crisis. 
 

Mr Tay said 80 per cent of household debt here is made up of mortgages, which, coupled with the climb in property prices since 2009, explains why household debt as a percentage of GDP shot up so sharply from 2007.
 

He said: "With (household debt) at such significant levels, it will be difficult for the government or policy makers to stimulate demand to offset the sluggish exports we are currently experiencing."
 

This has been worsened by panic selling of risk assets, such as US high yield and Asian local currency bonds, since the US Federal Reserve's indication last week that it might start tapering its bond-buying programme later this year. 
 

Mr Tay said a rise in US treasury yields usually leads to a rise in Singapore government bond yields. As the USD is a major component in the basket of currencies used to manage the SGD, interest rates here usually follow the trends of USD interest rates. 
 

"Given the sharp rise in credit growth over the last few years, I would not be surprised if an increase in interest rates is followed by deterioration in the loans portfolio of banks and other financial institutions; this would in turn lead to a tightening of credit supply and a higher cost of financing for credit in general."
 

He still believes the Asian market will continue growing, despite the impending halt of liquidity from the Fed. He rejects the notion that this could lead to a repeat of the Asian financial crisis "because the circumstances of both the global economy and, more importantly, the Asian economies, are now very different from 1994". 
 

Mr Tay said the Asian economies, excluding Japan, have strong fundamentals, with total foreign exchange reserves comprising more than half the world's GDP (52 per cent), much higher than in 1994 (23.6 per cent). Corporate balance sheets are similarly healthy, and although the net debt-to-equity ratio increased to 26.1 per cent from 18.3 per cent after the Lehman Brothers' crisis in 2008, this is still well below the 41.8 per cent in 1994, when the Fed began to raise interest rates. 
 

Despite a relatively sharp rise in debt over the past few years, the gross debt-to-GDP ratio for Asian economies excluding Japan averaged 46.4 per cent, with GDP growth for this year and the next likely to average 6.3 per cent. This is well above the 3 per cent growth rate for the world.
 

Mr Tay said: "In short, the Asian story not only remains intact, but is also more attractively valued than before. 
 

"Compared to the years just before the Asian financial crisis, Asia excluding Japan has significantly more FX reserves, lower net debt-to-equity levels and sovereign debt levels and healthy growth rates."

Everyone not staying in private properties have dept. The HDB loan already stretch 20 ~ 25 years payment and luckily, we can use our CPF loan payment.
 

Those staying in private properties, well ..... they have a higher loan thats all for they want status and comfort living.

I think HDB got insurance called 'Homeshield'. Like the owner passed away, the next of kin (usually wife or husband) need not pay for the rest of the loan....

y r we surprised at such news considering our mortgage rates haave been at record lows for 4yrs, DESPITE SG property being on a bullrun for 4yrs in a row. Its like feeding more n more oil to a fire which doesnt need extra fuel already.
 

Clearly any level headed investor can see this anomaly n be ready if things go haywire.
 

US treasuries n high yield junk debt has been crashing alot recently, in other words financing cost is rising & given SG banks get most liquidity from US banks, i agree w this article's other that rising rates shld b coming. In fact to me asia will be screwed as a result of this, & USA save themselves coz they dont care wat happens to us. They only care for themselves. If asian garmens mismanage QE effects, its no matter to them

SG where got fixed long term one? Most 3yrs fixed no? Also, go read the T&Cs, dont b surprised they can increase in "special" conditions.
 

anyway all we need to is that SIBOR mortgage has been "flat" for 4yrs but prop prices up 4yrs in a row. Nuff said.

Prop prices going up is not just down to SIBOR,
 

the increase in population might have just a little something to do with it.
 

Property prices rising is due to the imbalance of supply and demand.

Well , debt levels are high , very simple one lah , how many here can claim he bought his car/property via cash? Out 10 maybe u find 1 or 2. The rest would fall into those in debt. With the prices of property at unreasonable amounts , it is just a matter of time . Imagine an EC can easily fetch you a 1+ million and over if you are in the penthouse even if you are at ulu places like pasir ris. I am not sure if i can find as many to be able to earn 15k and above every month on average to be able to afford those million dollar houses with money to spare.
 

Not to mention the high amounts of debt due to credit cards and loose credit given by the bank , i even had sale personals calling me for loans and stuff and i am pretty sure many have some debt here and there. As the market slows , there are bound to be many unable to furfil their debt obligations and these are the people which will increase our Debt to gdp .

Enjoy now pay later....everyone is in debt just that how big or small....

Big debts are those dabbling in property, business, investments...

Those with no debt are probably not married, no cars, no house
 

Best is to only have one credit card as it is easy to spend but difficult to pay back....

To be fair, being in debt is not unique to Singapore. Although things like Housing & Cars are very expensive in Singapore, comparatively, but in other countries, on top of much higher taxes, people tends to buy more or bigger stuff. 
 

For instance, cars are dead cheap in US of A, but they tends to spend money buy higher spec/end cars, & they buy a few. Also they may spend a lot of money on their house, add this & that that can cost a lot. I know someone who have a swimming pool with beer taps. 
 

In Germany, the price of a typical 4-5 room HDB, you can get a a proper well insulated, quality house with garage & garden (out of the main cities). Guess what, they buy these houses (instead of cheap apartment), so they are same debt level as Sinagpore (give or take). 30 years loans are also not unusual. In Germany, its not uncommon for people to buy 'Fair weather cars, bikes, quadbikes etc' that only to be used in warmer weather, which is maybe 4 months of the year.  
 

But to be fair again, same debt level, but  what you get for the money is different! But there are plus points in Singapore, being considerablely safe, accessible (do not have to travel far for anything), as well as all year summer (if you like warm weather), & cheap 

domestic helpers.
 

But then again, you can say people in debt in other nation are often by lifestyle choice, but we can certainly spend less on otehr things, & Singaporeans, as well as many east Asia, are known to be big spenders of branded goods, clotehs & gadgets.

uh oh.... i/r going up anytime soon?  
 

High debt-GDP ratio could hurt in face of global slowdown

Bylivia yap 
 

THE rapid rise in household debt here, coming amid the uncertainty of global financial markets, has been red-flagged. 
 

Kelvin Tay, the regional chief investment officer for the Southern Asia-Pacific for UBS Wealth Management, said the high household debt levels, coupled with high property prices, could make Singapore vulnerable to a rise in unemployment, a reduction in incomes and asset deflation if a slowdown in global economic markets happens.
 

Singapore's household debt - total consumer loans of Domestic Banking Units - stood at 279 per cent of the total gross domestic product in the first quarter of this year, up from 177 per cent in the corresponding quarter in 2007.
 

The 279 per cent figure is even higher than the 198 per cent recorded in the first quarter of 2009, after the 2008 financial crisis. 
 

Mr Tay said 80 per cent of household debt here is made up of mortgages, which, coupled with the climb in property prices since 2009, explains why household debt as a percentage of GDP shot up so sharply from 2007.
 

He said: "With (household debt) at such significant levels, it will be difficult for the government or policy makers to stimulate demand to offset the sluggish exports we are currently experiencing."
 

This has been worsened by panic selling of risk assets, such as US high yield and Asian local currency bonds, since the US Federal Reserve's indication last week that it might start tapering its bond-buying programme later this year. 
 

Mr Tay said a rise in US treasury yields usually leads to a rise in Singapore government bond yields. As the USD is a major component in the basket of currencies used to manage the SGD, interest rates here usually follow the trends of USD interest rates. 
 

"Given the sharp rise in credit growth over the last few years, I would not be surprised if an increase in interest rates is followed by deterioration in the loans portfolio of banks and other financial institutions; this would in turn lead to a tightening of credit supply and a higher cost of financing for credit in general."
 

He still believes the Asian market will continue growing, despite the impending halt of liquidity from the Fed. He rejects the notion that this could lead to a repeat of the Asian financial crisis "because the circumstances of both the global economy and, more importantly, the Asian economies, are now very different from 1994". 
 

Mr Tay said the Asian economies, excluding Japan, have strong fundamentals, with total foreign exchange reserves comprising more than half the world's GDP (52 per cent), much higher than in 1994 (23.6 per cent). Corporate balance sheets are similarly healthy, and although the net debt-to-equity ratio increased to 26.1 per cent from 18.3 per cent after the Lehman Brothers' crisis in 2008, this is still well below the 41.8 per cent in 1994, when the Fed began to raise interest rates. 
 

Despite a relatively sharp rise in debt over the past few years, the gross debt-to-GDP ratio for Asian economies excluding Japan averaged 46.4 per cent, with GDP growth for this year and the next likely to average 6.3 per cent. This is well above the 3 per cent growth rate for the world.
 

Mr Tay said: "In short, the Asian story not only remains intact, but is also more attractively valued than before. 
 

"Compared to the years just before the Asian financial crisis, Asia excluding Japan has significantly more FX reserves, lower net debt-to-equity levels and sovereign debt levels and healthy growth rates."



 
 

pretty amateur piece of work.    To gauge the financial well being of of the household, the important thing to look at is net worth, aka asset minus debt. Yes, Singapore household debt has been increased a lot to S$200 billion. But, Singapore household has an asset of 1.4 trillion. Debt to asset ratio has been pretty stable over past 10 years at 16%.

in a recession, your asset value drops like a rock
 

so what happens to your debt to asset ratio?
 

and banks only look at your debt repayment ability.  
 

if your asset value drops lower than your debt
 

you are in trouble.

Well , debt levels are high , very simple one lah , how many here can claim he bought his car/property via cash? Out 10 maybe u find 1 or 2. The rest would fall into those in debt. With the prices of property at unreasonable amounts , it is just a matter of time . Imagine an EC can easily fetch you a 1+ million and over if you are in the penthouse even if you are at ulu places like pasir ris. I am not sure if i can find as many to be able to earn 15k and above every month on average to be able to afford those million dollar houses with money to spare.
 

Not to mention the high amounts of debt due to credit cards and loose credit given by the bank , i even had sale personals calling me for loans and stuff and i am pretty sure many have some debt here and there. As the market slows , there are bound to be many unable to furfil their debt obligations and these are the people which will increase our Debt to gdp .



 

Probably out of 100 maybe 1 or 2, mate , not out of 10.

There will be no crash or fire sale in Singapore.
 

If COE crash tomorrow, I will buy a new.
 

If property crash tomorrow, I will buy a bigger place.
 

If stock crash tomorrow, I will load up.
 

I have been hearing about the crash is coming for the last 3 years
 

and everyone that said it is wrong. Off course no one has come here 
 

and admitted it. But as they say Success has many fathers but 
 

failure is illegitimate.

I am saying the rise is house prices in Sg is not due to speculation
 

but a genuine increase in demand due to the rise in the population.
 

People coming here need a place to stay whether they rent or buy.
 

A crash is caused when people buy things they do not need and have no use 
 

in the hope of selling it to another fool at a higher price.
 

The rise in the price of homes and cars is a real demand and 
 

a crash is only possible in a speculative environment.
 

The only thing that can pull the prices of home down
 

is stop the inflow of people or create an oversupply.

I shant comment on the work becos i didnt read it in its completeness but let me share with you something.
 

Loans unless paid off can never become smaller.

Assets unless being traded up will never become bigger.

In a negative situation especially, you think debt and asset values remain the same, moving in one direction hand in hand?
 


 

My not so intelligent brain tells me that the loans with interest rate raises will increase and asset values with lesser demand will move opposite direction.

Not saying that it will crash but i put my money where my mouth is instead of just plain talking.
 

Cheers

By the time we reach 6.9m
 

everything will be so damn expensive
 

that even if price came down 20% - 30%
 

it will have gone up 200% - 300%.
 

Its like an S class now $439,000 
 

even if it came down $30,000
 

and you can buy it for $409,000
 

would you buy it and tell everyone
 

you got a bargain?

hahah u know y they did QE anot? Coz central bankers know that given enough inflation generated by QE, debt will remain constant but asset will nominally increase, so print enuff $ suddenly gearing reduce alot.
 

The US have got 1 part of QE right, but to get it completely right, they have to stop their debt increase. That is more political than anything.

hmmm... i dun defer.. but i believe that most ppl earn enough to stay in hdb only or OCR condo that cost less than 700psf. 

The demand for mid or high-end condo may not be there. 

The place where i stay.. after TOP for 3 yrs, there are still 10% unsold units. Even though the prices has increase 30%. The current rental income hardly cover the installment of the 1st buyer with the increasing spread, let alone adding in the maintenance and pty tax cost. Even though nearby, there are newer projects asking for higher psf... i suspect the prices to fall at least 20% in the next 2 yrs... when the mkt demand for rental goes down, follow by the demand for purchase. This is my observation of the mkt now.
 

I believed that OCR(leasehold)  will stablized at 600-700psf , RCR(freehold) ard 1000psf and CCR (freehold) ard 1400psf...

if the buying now is in anticipation of the 6.9m population target and not for own stay
 

wouldn't that fit your definition of speculation?
 

btw in a recession, population increase may not be forthcoming

i'm in a horizon hill fb group..actually for residents to share info but also got some agents inside also.

one guy has also commented that sales is faster and better in new than pre-owned.
 

think i mentioned earlier.. pre-owned price may even be cheaper than new. i was offered one for a few tens cheaper, and that was 1 plus year back.

Is it the norm to calculate debt vs 3 mths of GDP or 6mth or 12 mths GDP? 
 

Each option will result in different headline figure but the most spectacular headline will be using 3 mth GDP.

Is it me or did anyone noticed that the word "monitor" seems to be a popular word to be used by government and authorities ? This news article is one example, they have stastic that household debt is not improving. Its not the 1st time they use the word monitor on the household debt. Do the government want to mointor till it goes out of control or go in situation where the problem is too big then start to do something drastic about it? Remember to make policy changes it takes time, need to debate in Parliament, draft bills, etc. turnaround time is at least 6 months. Do they think they have enough time to reverse the situiation when it goes out of control? I rather they start early implement drasic measures to reverse the situation now, rising consumer debt is not new and its been propping up in the news for many years and is getting worst. Not now then when? Wait till its too late to do something about it?

"Monitor" gives you the impression that someone is doing something.
But he is not.
 
When all hell break loose, he wakes up and then he says he was monitoring but he can't control the situation.

top down approach ... even the ground activity has adopted the "monitor" syndrome
 
when you drive on the road ... if you see any road works or contruction ... 1 person do + 3 person monitor ...

Monitor means kwa heei (see show) as like computer monitor can kwa blue heei too.
 
Honestly, besides 'monitor', I doubt there's better way for them to reply, not when we are all inside the square box. Thought it's a SOP cookie cutter response be it from public or private establishments.
 
I never see response like "We have taken action already".

NS taught us guys a lot of things, so even in two short years, we grow by more than that, if we paid attention.. =D
 
Haha... But the best lesson is still "do and don't get caught"....
 
acting busy is actually harder than actual working u know.. lol
 
Yeah, agreed 100%... But work too hard will get more work, so act busy is for long term gains...

Monitor means eye power. It is preferred over "supervise" because supervise entails some work, which may increase productivity, which is an absolute no-no if you don't want to be accused of spoiling market.
