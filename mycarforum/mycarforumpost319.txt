UP for ballot sale on Friday: 992 Housing Board flats in various districts. 
 

The flats in Ang Mo Kio, Kallang/Whampoa, Queenstown, Jurong West and The Pinnacle @ Duxton, TP@D, are surpluses from the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS).  
 

They comprise studio Apartments (SAs) in Ang Mo Kio, three-room to five-room flats in Kallang/Whampoa, Queenstown and Jurong West, as well as S1 and 111 units of S2 flats in TP@D. 
 

Units from TP@D, Singapore's first iconic 50-storey public housing project, range from S$457,000 to S$555,000 for S1 flats and S$545,000 to S$646,000 for S2 flats. The development boasts an internationally award-winning design, with sky bridges linking its seven tower blocks and sky gardens at the 26th and 50th storeys and plug-ins like planters, balconies, bay windows and extended bays. 
 

HDB sells new flats at a discount to the market, with the prices of these flats lower than the resale flats in the vicinity.  For example, resale prices of four-room flats at Cantonment Close, Tanjong Pagar and Jalan Membina range from S$465,000 to S$560,000, while that of 5-room flats range from S$593,000 to S$670,000. 
 

Buyers looking for more affordable options can consider the flats at Jurong West, where prices of three-room and four-room flats range from S$142,000 to S$160,000 and S$213,000 to S$253,000 respectively. 

Buyers who do not find a flat of their choice in this exercise can consider applying for a new flat under the Build-to-Order (BTO) exercises in future. The BTO is the mainstay of HDB's new flat supply. 

Alternatively, they can also consider buying a resale flat. Eligible first-timers enjoy CPF Housing Grant of up to S$40,000 to buy a resale flat.

your colleague should be able to buy but he might need to scrimp and save and he cannot afford to lose his job else he needs to pay instalments by cash which could be a burden eventually. So must really think thrice before committing to a long term purchase item.

i wonder whether its entrapment or what... at such a high price, as some bros mentioned, combined 8k how to afford? loan 30 years and work their butts off? 

come recession, tio pok no job/pay cut, wanna downgrade also cannot.. cos the valuation would be lesser than what they paid, and don't forget the resale levy (assuming 5 room, its at $45k.. discussed in another thread), stamp duty and dunno what nots. 

nowadays hdb don't give out loans but banks do right? don't pay loan kenna evict notice how? 
 

tio tard..sell cannot, dont sell also cannot... jump off the flat

ya.. take for example. 

my place in sengkang 6yrs ago bought for about 220k, top unit, downstair got lrt, coffeeshop, clinic, childcare and other provision shops.. sport complex nearby, 15 min walk to compass point and 1 to 5 min walk to good schools 

even resale (based on some neighbors/agent) only worth about 380k 
 

now at fernvale residence (jun bto), with hdb 'subsidy', they are selling from 293k to 365k? i dont understand.. 

inflation within these couple of years cause the price to shoot so much (even i compare my top unit 220k with their bottom unit, assuming cheapest at 293k, already 33% more!) 
 

no offence meant to bros who booked it

For this type of selling price, how do a couple with income of 8K afford it? 
 
we just calculated - with less than 8k total, we don't need to fork out any cash. of course that's maxing out CPF. 
 
hold for five years then see how.
 
wish us luck!

Historically, prices of properties have never come down, now with a 5.5% "population" growth, you should get a property ASAP, even if the market nosedives, you sell low, buy low.

Unless one owns 2 properties, its very hard to make money from market fluctuations. 
 
Dun understand one of the computation stated in papers though. If the flat costs $600K, and loan at 2.6% (HDB loan) is extended to 30 years, monthly installment is about $2400 per mth. How did they end up with $3K per mth?  Somemore, people will down 20% 1st payment so the mthly payment should also come down correspondingly.

Heng I bought my S2 unit at about $380K back in end 2003. Everyone was so pessimistic with my purchase price back then. They were saying that I just need to top up say 100K to get a good condo or buy a normal 5 rm at $200K+. Good that I stand by my decision.  
 
Properties should appreciate in the long run... if you are willing to hold. Even in today's price I should say.

I am looking at 2009/2010 when lots of private development TOP.
 
If the economy maintain half-dead, there will be good buys when speculators will dump their investments before TOP.
 
My other option is to sit out till 2013 when I can again re-apply for the HDB loan (unless the rule changes).
 
My advantage is that I am in no hurry to buy a flat. Given the gap of private and public housing is smaller, it makes more sense to buy private.
 
I am not a guru in property, that's just the options I have at the moment.

If you waiting for market to drop, then you must look at pte property, it is showing signs of cracking as many TOP units coming on line this year and 2010 and speculators may not have holding power, many developers with current projects also shaking as banks also get jittery, I went to a launch last saturday and the small developer was giving big discounts to clear stock but he has only sold 3 units out of 18 in the past 1 month and has a schedule to meet when the construction starts and the payments start kicking in and interest starts building up, pretty scary. 
 
HDB market, sellers can expect strong holding power as rental restrictions have eased substantially, even if there are owners in trouble with jobs, they can easily rent out their units and stay at the parent's homes and collect rent and wait for good prices before selling and as one poster has said, the sub prime conditions of the US may not apply here, as HDBs are financed through CPF and not unsecured loans.

spot on!
 
I see it as a buyer's market from now till 2010. Personally I feel its still too early to go in now.
 
The only reason why I feel they are originally holding all those unsold HDB flat was hoping to make more profit when the economy is flourishing. The sub-prime and now credit crunch must've spoiled their plan so now quickly dish all out before they had to lelong again like 5yrs ago.

SK and Punggol got potential... The masterplan is to develop into a recreational area. The sports hall/swimming pool is already up and a couple of more parks are under development currently. It is now served by 3 expressways (TPE/KPE/CTE) which means it's no longer as ulu as before.
 
I think i got my exec flat at about the same time u backed out. $258k for mid floors... it was too good to let it go.

Call your real estate agent friends, or make some RE agent friends. RE agents have big chances to make money from property, just imagine, if the property comes out for sale in the classifieds how many parties have rejected it as a good deal. 
 
1) Agents themselves 
2) Their friends and relatives 
3) Their clients or business associates 
4) other agents in the network
 
So really not worth buying already. I usually buy and sell properties from network only deals.

at an average inflation rate of 5% per year, it's about 34% inflation in total (very crudely speaking). the 220k in 2002 is worth 294k today.
 
his 220K is top unit...
currently the 294K is bottom unit..
 
as a rule of thumb, every floor up is at least 1k increase.
 
so should be 220k compared with 365k assuming both top floor units.
 
crazy price for basic housing...

well as i said, it's a very crude calculation, but i think it is fair for property prices (private or public) to increase as a result of inflation and increasing costs.
 
i may be wrong, but i think also you have to look at the broader picture. as the years go by, your pay increase. 6 years ago, you were earning $Y, now you'd be earning $(Y x 1.34 + extra). 
 
our parents bought flats for $9k, it's mighty loads of money in their time. don't tell me we expect prices to stay that low today? i think we need to start accepting certain dynamics of the economy.
 
furthermore, there's no such thing as government giving you free money (in the form of greater subsidies). the more subsidies they give, they more they'll tax you and i think that'll make ever more people unhappy. so in reality, it's no thanks to the greedy few who try to make a quick dollar - they are the ones pushing prices up.

I had been thru several bear and bull periods and one observation I had is,
sometimes people in the bull period, tends to forget how the bear look like.
 
I had friends got retrenched, can't secure a job that pays equally well, can't service their housing loan, end up bankrupt, sell house......
 
Well, a forum is still a forum afterall.
 
At the end of the day, he/she still make his/her final decision, no one is going to stop him/her.

Just my 2 cents to this thread, & I am not saying about you.
