Husband and wife agree to a divorce of convenience
 
A husband and wife in Singapore had apparently agreed to divorce — just so that they can each own a HDB flat.
 
This was after they figured marriage is just a status, and by divorcing, they can unlock their Central Provident Fund monies in a different way.
 

Wife bought another flat under singles scheme
 
The couple originally bought a HDB flat together when they got married. It was paid for using the husband’s CPF.
 
The husband is now a cab driver. He is likely to be 54 this year, or somewhere in his mid-fifties.
 
He claims he cannot withdraw his CPF money by next year because it does not meet the Minimum Sum, or Retirement Sum, which is the minimum amount of money needed in your CPF account when you turn 55 before withdrawals can be made.
 
The wife too will not be able to withdraw any CPF money in a few years’ time, since she also does not meet the minimum sum.
 
The plan
 
Husband and wife then divorced. On paper.
 
But they are obviously still very much together.
 
This frees up the wife to buy a HDB flat of her own as a single under the Single Singapore Citizen (SSC) scheme.
 
She is able to get a housing grant for the flat as a second-timer single Singapore citizen applicant.
 
She can pay for it with her CPF — which otherwise would be locked in once she turns 55.
The man now owns the first flat as a single.
 
Rental income
 
Since he has lived in the house for longer than the five-year Minimum Occupation Period, he is able to rent it out.
 
The husband then proceeds to live with his now ex-wife in the new flat, while both enjoy the passive income from the rental of the first matrimonial flat — said to be about $2,500 monthly.

If this is indeed true I don't know what measures the government will take to prevent more couples from following this path.
 
But can the government even intervene us from playing with this loop hole in the system?

no real names 
 
90% fake news.
 
good story from writer
 
if you can only afford a 1 mil loan as a couple even if you divorce 
 
as a single person you can only afford half of 1 mil which is 50% 
 
 
if you think that by divorce you can get 1 mil loan each
 
then it's time for you to go back primary school and learn maths

the story could be true and it is possible, common in HK and China, nothing can stop a 抢钱夫妻  
 
the question is how old is she and i believe single can only buy resale flat. How much loan can she take at age 50?
 
then why the wife so stupid and let the man keep the original flat? why not she keep it and let him buy another flat loan under his name?  can she guarantee the husband won't find another woman after he collect his cpf at 55

the hint is in the story already isnt it... the wife's CPF was not utilised in paying for the 1st flat... ie... her CPF is sufficient to buy from HDB with no actual loan...

if she cannot meet the minimum sum of say $200K, how to buy a flat with $200K? not to mentioned only the OA portion.

Even divorced also need 3 years separation first right?
 
So if the man is already 54, and needed his CPF to "buy over" his wife share of the house upon divorce, then this method will not fly since by the time he finally divorce he is already way pass 55.

A typical Singapore divorce, if it is mutual, amicable and uncontested, takes approximately 4 months. The hearing will be conducted within the Family Justice Courts' Simplified Uncontested Divorce Process.

The report says her CPF don't have a lot of money.
 
But never reported her bank got no money hor.
 
Maybe she used whatever CPF, plus take cheque book go HDB buy also can right? Could be a part-time clerk, but full-time investor of shares or property so the bank account is fat fat one...

this story is about a silver-age couple.
 
so what will happen when the younger married couples read this ??
 
life planning 101:
1. find a partner
2. get married
3. buy house
3a. if want children, have the kids first.
4. get divorced
5. one will keep the house as a single
6. the other will buy another house as a single.
7. rent out one of the flats.
8. live happily ever after.

China got many patterns hor.
 
What you're talking about is getting land to build house.
 
But if wanna buy ready-built property, then chinese govt introduced laws to curb speculations and inflation long ago. Each family can only buy one. So a married couple will also divorce on paper so that both husband and wife can buy one each. Then sell and make tons of money.
 
I've always been amazed at China's devt. When i was a kid 40-45 yr ago, my parents and grandparents would pool a bit of $$ together to send back to China relatives when they wrote letter over to say need to buy TV (and later, fridge, washing machine, etc.). Then later it would be to build a house. And whenever any of my parents/uncles/aunties/grandparents went to visit, they will also collect all the old clothes that everyone here is no longer wearing, then bring back and my China relatives would be elated...
 
Fast forward 45 yr, now they (my cousins and nieces/nephews, no longer my uncle) all got house got cars got biz... I think cars bigger than mine. House is confirmed many times bigger as i think everyone got 3-storey house...
 
Wonder how come money came so easy for them in just one generation.
 
And how come for us so difficult to find job, buy house buy car???

same here ... every year will get letters from china ... and every letter starts with well wishes which will the progress to need money for this and that. But now my dad is sick and does not bother with them anymore ... we also have so-called property in china ... but I am prepared to let it go.
 
present rural china is like SG 30 years ago ... so now they are starting to develop and things will start to improve for them, esp now that the Chinese govt is going to develop Hainan island ... everything is looking up for them !
 
as for one family one house I dunno that part ... is it for like China HDB ? meaning govt subsidized housing ?
 
coz my wife's school mate in Hainan just sold her beauty business and bought two condo units there ... shuttling between her old house and one condo unit .... and then renting out the other condo unit.
 
this trip had made me think ... did I hamper my wife's progress ? would she had been better off if she did not marry me and stayed in Hainan and have a better life like all her friends I met ...

ok, i won't profess to claim i know china policy well. What i said was based on what i heard from my chinese friends (ex-colleague) and relatives.
 
One possibility is the curbs could be targeted at certain cities only (where prices skyrocketed), or for certain fixed period only (like our cooling measures).
 
Not govt housing, i think. Think it's condos.
 
Your relatives still asking for $$? My father said that when they (him and my grandma) went to a city, Xinhui, some 35-40 yr ago, my whole clan of Chinese relatives (my father had one brother and one uncle there), walked (dunno how many hours) from a town to the city to meet them. Then in the hotel room, basically stripped it bare (of bulbs, towels, crockery), before the hotel alerted my father, who asked them to put everything back... Can imagine how tough life was for them then...
 
But now my cousins' children also grow up liao, one of them became grandfather at 45 year old... When my father goes back, got take photo go restaurant the table can seat >20 pax, with lots of food... A bit yaya papaya liao, according to my dad...
 
Heard something like all those who remain in the town (and never moved out to the city), were given land by the govt, and they somehow got money to build either houses to stay or shops to rent out. So now all getting by quite ok. In fact, my eldest cousin who went out to the city in the early days, hoping to find a better job, has been trying to get his 户口 back to the town to get land from govt... but so far no success...

same for my wife ... she is still not applying pink ic as she heard her hometown maybe got "enbloc" ... so she hanging on for a while first..
 
like I said, now my father sick ... he does not even watch tv, less read letters ...
 
anyway, I think my relatives in Hainan are also doing much better than us now ... since it boomed in the last 3 years or so.
 
my mom's grand nephew also got married 2 years back ... and the pics are similar to those on the internet where you see the bride is practically lugging gold around on their body during the ceremony ...
 
but weird thing is my mom still think that Hainan is still in the 90s' where the ppl are poor .... LOL !!

By communist law, all land and property belongs to the CCP so people can only "buy" up to 70-year lease. It's a bit crazy for the sky-rocketing prices even for very old units as they are not freehold property in China. We are also seeing a similar trend here with HDB and 99-year leasehold property. There is a "traditional" mentality that the gahmen will "take care" of them when the lease expires.

you China expert also right, so ask you  :
 
when you said 70-yr lease, is that referring to the condos over there?
 
What about those ancestral homes in the villages/towns? Those i thought are freehold or for life? Or govt will take back too?

I no expert. Blow water only. Technically, all land is owned by CCP. You better consult a lawyer whether you have right of use and what kind of rights to your ancestral home. Agricultural land are also more restrictive than urban land, but has been a lucrative business for people in power with the know-how.

If a couple is planning for an uncontested div, its esier to use point 2 - Unreasonable Behaviour.
 
Wife can allege that hubby's insatiable desire for MMF, his 100GB porn collection, his passion to post insta pics in wife's underwear, are grounds for unreasonable behaviour.

I no expert. Blow water only. Technically, all land is owned by CCP. You better consult a lawyer whether you have right of use and what kind of rights to your ancestral home. Agricultural land are also more restrictive than urban land, but has been a lucrative business for people in power with the know-how.  
 
No lah, not intending to do anything to my ancestral homes.
 
But my mother's side, the house in the village has been vacant and is in disrepair state. Heard my mother said her parents passed away when she was around 30, and they were in KL. My mother was also born in selangor, meaning that my maternal grandparents would have left their village 80+ yr ago at least. But govt never did anything to it, as other houses in the neighbourhood are still been occupied.
 
As for my father's side, my grandpa's ancestral home was quite run down in the past, but my late granduncle (my late grandpa's younger brother) had helped to lock it up and do a bit of maintenance in the past - after my father got his siblings to pool some money to touch up the house a bit so that it's not v v run down. That was >10 yr ago.
 
And CCP, at least the local govt, had spent some money to renovate the house and turned it into a mini museum （故居）last year. I've been there twice in the past, but not since this mini museum conversion...
We've no plans for it anyhow...

Matter of time even if it is fictional now.
Or rather, cases go unreported or publicised.

Your grandpa must be quite famous. The village should have a local chief who is also the village party secretary of some sorts, I think he has the authority to do whatever to the village homes.
 
The trend now in many villages across China is to convert them into "high value villages". This is one of Xi's big achievements from his days as provincial secretary. The villagers become shareholders of the "joint-venture". Where the scenery is nice, they may build farm stay resorts like Cameron Highlands. If not, they could be redeveloped into some industrial village. If suay, the industries can be highly pollutive.
 
If nothing happens, the village is too far or there's no value add. Also not bad, at least can still see your ancestral home the way it is.

If this is indeed true I don't know what measures the government will take to prevent more couples from following this path.
 
But can the government even intervene us from playing with this loop hole in the system?

 
This has been happening for awhile already.

My grandpa was a (poor) nobody lah. But he went around SEA to solicit donations to fight the Japs during WW2, which was no mean feat during a period when people were struggling to fill their stomach. Uneducated and a nobody, he even sold off a newborn son to a childless couple to contribute to the anti-Japs funds. That's why i still have cousins in China (that uncle has passed on), as that childless couple went back to China after WW2.
 
Some scholars and provincial govt people somehow found out about it in the last ~10+ yr, so my grandpa was honoured.
 
In case it's of interest, here's a link (in Chinese) on it
http://www.ladpf.cn/detail_16483887.htm
 
 
 
The ancestral home used to be quite secluded, but ~20 yr ago that village was chosen to house some people who were displaced by the flooding of the 3 Gorges, and a school was built nearby, i was told. Anyway, since noone has been staying there, so also not a concern...

Fake news. If it is true, HDB may have confiscated one of the plats if it is discovered. 

 
https://mothership.sg/2018/05/married-couple-divorced-buy-hdb-flat-as-single/?nlarticleid=11561273
 
Husband and wife agree to a divorce of convenience
 
A husband and wife in Singapore had apparently agreed to divorce — just so that they can each own a HDB flat.
 
This was after they figured marriage is just a status, and by divorcing, they can unlock their Central Provident Fund monies in a different way.
 

Wife bought another flat under singles scheme
 
The couple originally bought a HDB flat together when they got married. It was paid for using the husband’s CPF.
 
The husband is now a cab driver. He is likely to be 54 this year, or somewhere in his mid-fifties.
 
He claims he cannot withdraw his CPF money by next year because it does not meet the Minimum Sum, or Retirement Sum, which is the minimum amount of money needed in your CPF account when you turn 55 before withdrawals can be made.
 
The wife too will not be able to withdraw any CPF money in a few years’ time, since she also does not meet the minimum sum.
 
The plan
 
Husband and wife then divorced. On paper.
 
But they are obviously still very much together.
 
This frees up the wife to buy a HDB flat of her own as a single under the Single Singapore Citizen (SSC) scheme.
 
She is able to get a housing grant for the flat as a second-timer single Singapore citizen applicant.
 
She can pay for it with her CPF — which otherwise would be locked in once she turns 55.
The man now owns the first flat as a single.
 
Rental income
 
Since he has lived in the house for longer than the five-year Minimum Occupation Period, he is able to rent it out.
 
The husband then proceeds to live with his now ex-wife in the new flat, while both enjoy the passive income from the rental of the first matrimonial flat — said to be about $2,500 monthly.

It is more than avoiding ABSD. A couple canot own more than 1 HDB flat even if one is willing to pay for ABSD. By going through a so call divorce process would allow them to buy a HDB each. Assuming they pay 500k for a HDB, by renting for 2,400 a month would mean they get 6% return of their investment, this is better than OA interest rate and yet get instant withdrawal of insterest instead of being locked in by CPF till 55 year old.
If they take up a loan and use CPF OA to pay for installment,  they get even better deal because OA will get them better interest rate return than interest rate of bank loan.

SINGAPORE: The Housing and Development Board (HDB) will remove its three-year time-bar policy for divorcees to buy subsidised flats, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong announced in Parliament on Tuesday (Mar 6).
Speaking during his ministry’s Committee of Supply debate, Mr Wong noted that some MPs have asked if the Government can help divorcees make a smoother housing transition, for the benefit of their children.

after less wedding costs,  honeymoon costs , car loan,  hdb loan,  study loan, renovation loan,  already in big debt
the balance income after monthly loan payment and expenses only enough to support 1 child
cant even afford maid or other luxury

same for my wife ... she is still not applying pink ic as she heard her hometown maybe got "enbloc" ... so she hanging on for a while first..
 
like I said, now my father sick ... he does not even watch tv, less read letters ...
 
anyway, I think my relatives in Hainan are also doing much better than us now ... since it boomed in the last 3 years or so.
 
my mom's grand nephew also got married 2 years back ... and the pics are similar to those on the internet where you see the bride is practically lugging gold around on their body during the ceremony ...
 
but weird thing is my mom still think that Hainan is still in the 90s' where the ppl are poor .... LOL !!

 
   Bro Ysc3,
 
I think we are in the same boat, Heard the letter-writing regularly, my late dad kept sending money monthly and built my younger uncle a house, which thy didn't have the money to maintain, becomes depilated throughout the years.
 
So sick of their La-Kopi session over dinner gossiping on how to squeeze monies from the fourth generation, thy all think we have it better than them, Now we should ask them to return the money favour . . .  I can complain cant afford new car, coz COE too high, crazy rising cost of living, min. Chay peng is $3.00/, MRT always breaks down, plus all the trains smell bad coz full of other races combines, Highways still jammed despite paying ERP to get-in . . .
