hmm... Do you think there is a possiblity that there may be a big commerical pty market crash next yr?
 

Many SME business I know is facing crisis. Given the higher rental cost , operating cost as well as manpower shortage...
 

Do you think there is a likelihood that many small business will fold soon. Causing many commerical properties to be "out of rent".

well... it is possible but the govt can play a merry-go-round system.

the old ones will either close or move to elsewhere, the new ones will come in.

the govt will make a good balance by attracting more investors to invest in SG, just that sectors might change. eg. from engineering to services, etc.
 

we are now in one quarter crisis and this might bring forward to Q1'13. if so, SG will face technical recession any time soon.

based on my understanding, next year, perhaps Q2'13, there might be a recovery but not a full recovery. it is better than crisis though.
 

SG is not a good place to start businesses which required lots of manpower which we are lacking of.

SG should be a place to invest on services and any other sectors which required less manpower and yet we are able to provide better infrastructural.

we are heading to the wrong path since many years back. it is now up to the govt to decide a U-turn else the people will continue to suffer. : p

anything is possible.

one possible way is to demolish the commercial buildings and make condominiums or shopping malls or any other potential investments.

trust me, with such situation, our govt will step in because it involved profits.

Yeah, definitely buying more stuff online.  Saves the hassle and time of travelling to the shops and braving the crowds, plus generally cheaper.  Means more time to do other things.

it's the shopping malls that i am thinking will probably "die" ... commercial rent for shopping malls has increase quite alot recently esp those in the OCR.. 

As some bros here mentioned, it's cheaper to buy off the internet. 
 

With most ppl paying off their mortgages, how much is left to spend at these malls ? Couple with the workers crunch.. i wonder how long some businesses going to survives..
 

demolish and build commerical building require time.. it's like steering a ship.. will the government make the u-turn early and fast enough ?

i find this weird too, but our govt keeps building more shopping malls.
 

if you look at it, before the malls are built, nearly all shops were booked.

basically, this country is in a mess if you asked me.

the weirdest thing is that, the current ones giving up their shops, there will be new ones filling in the gap. we are just asking for it.

the govt just sit back, look at the final report and comment, "we are still under control".

One thing for sure. Many businessmen are over leverage, same as many house owners.

The citizens debt is simply too big to fail.

When a crash do come, the Singapore will be gone!

I don't think the current gov will ever allow even a slight dip. The repercussion of a depressed citizens will lead to depressed support for the gov.

There is very low chance the gov will do nothing to prop up the commercial or private properties.

The stakes are too high for Singapore to ever slip into recession or depression.

I am quite confident the good times will stay good, at worst just a slow positive growth. Crash is impossible as this world has too much money floating around in recent times.

Another tranche of hot money may be coming to save the fiscal cliff soon.

The near terms, properties will still HUAT!!!

Agree, a crash will always come unexpectedly. If everyone is expecting it, it will not happen because we would have avoided it.

Which one of you here are servicing a car loan a house loan that takes up around 30-50% of your gross salary - the thinking is that is OK to take a loan nowadays but we're all spending future money. Correct me if my perception is wrong but there seems to be more money being loaned/borrowed than there is physical money. Sooner or later it would come to a grinding halt when the guy at the end of the line actually wants to see some paper money but all he gets from his debtor is a, "look for my debtor", who has to "look for MY debtor" until he gets to the other end of the line and finds that there is no money there... its a simplistic point of view I have. Sorry, I am no finance or stocks/shares expert....

commercial got office, retail. Retail looks shaky as rents are very high. but retail also make money cos of human traffic. 
 

office seems a good bet cos like never enough, esp in the central area. 
 

Industrial looks affordable. as usual, it's all about holding power. 
 

recently, i viewed a light industrial. inside plenty of packed clothes. think doing online biz.

On the other hand, the stock of office space decreased by 22,000 sq m (nett) in 3rd Quarter 2012. As a result, the island-wide vacancy rate of office space as at the end of 3rd Quarter 2012 decreased to 9.7%, from 10.9% as at the end of 2nd Quarter 2012 (see Annexes A-5 & E-1).

Then very soon we'll see the GST-free limit reduced from the current $400. On the contary, the cap should be adjusted higher to cater for inflation.
 

Not surprising, when Stinktel starts seeing a decline in profits for IDD and phone lines, they start to cut the cap on mobile data plans to earn from there, instead of upgrading the infrastructure to provide faster speeds for more content access. Let's see in 2 yrs time the network is less congested with the data cap.
 

Till then, they'll definitely justify with a lame reason to restrict how much we can buy in overseas. Remember increase GST to help the poor in justification to increase GST?

Yes, this will come... it's the matter of when, not if.... However, even then, it's mostly still cheaper....

Doubt they'll decrease rent. Take a look at some malls managed by the REITs, they rather leave it empty than to lower the rent.
 

Kopitiam Square at Sengkang is one good example. The location is good, yet the number of stalls in operation is only around 50%.

Buyers snap up units at Alexandra Central
 

99-year leasehold commercial devt attracts overwhelming interest
 
 
 

ALMOST every unit of a mixed development launched in Alexandra yesterday has been snapped up - a stark sign that buyers are turning to commercial property in the wake of new cooling measures.

Only one of the 115 strata retail units released remained unsold as at 9pm yesterday after a dramatic day of sales that caught even the developer by surprise.

It was estimated that at least 20 buyers on average were competing for each unit at the 99-year leasehold Alexandra Central, while a shop space on the third storey had as many as 155 interested buyers submitting blank cheques for a ballot.

"I had strong confidence in the project but didn't expect it to do so well," said Chip Eng Seng group chief executive Raymond Chia.

The units were sold at between $4,000 and $8,000 per sq ft, said a spokesman from CEL Development, Chip Eng Seng's property arm.

Alexandra Central is next to Ikea and on the site of the former Safra building in Alexandra Road. CEL Development paid $189 million, or $789 psf per plot ratio, for the 85,517 sq ft site in 2011.

The project includes 31 food and beverage retail units and 85 shop units. The largest shop unit in the project was not launched for sale yesterday.

Mr Chia said Alexandra Central received an unexpectedly high level of interest when it was opened for preview over the weekend.

"We initially planned a soft launch on Wednesday but because the response was so overwhelming we decided to bring it forward to Monday," Mr Chia added.

When The Straits Times visited the showflat yesterday afternoon, it was packed with agents and buyers, some of whom had been there as early as 9am.

Some were genuine end-users hoping to secure shop space before prices rose further, while others said they were interested in investing in commercial property.

Mr Simon Chye, 55, who runs snack shop business Hello Food, bought a 667 sq ft F&B retail unit on the first floor for around $4,538,000.

Mr Chye, who plans to open an outlet in Alexandra Central, said in Mandarin that he wanted to buy shop space now as prices were rising, and thought the project had a good location.

Investors were drawn to the project because of the recent cooling measures imposed on the residential and industrial sectors.

Madam Zheng Fuying, 48, said in Mandarin that she was interested in investing in commercial space as it was the only segment of the market untouched by the new cooling measures.

She added that she wanted to buy shop space as a long-term investment because retail space was getting more expensive but the market was not yet overheated.

Alexandra Central will include a 450-room hotel managed by Park Hotel Group. Construction is expected to be completed by June 2016.

You are right. Rental cost can always be adjusted according to market condition. No crash, just yet. The most worrying one, are those individual started to lost their jobs. This will normal follow by delay of loan repayments of their private properties. And there it goes, fire sales. I just wait of that depress period to come, after sold a local property in late 2011.
