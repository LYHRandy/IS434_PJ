Bros,
I notice that there's usually no PUB aka City Gas which is piped into landed?
That means that heaters, and some dryers etc can only be electric.
I am used to gas for cooking, for heaters and I wonder if anyone has added City Gas to their homes?
 
I did email them, and they quoted a few thousand just to get a connection:
 
 

 
Please be advised there is a minimum connection fee of $4,700/- (excluding GST) regardless of whether there is a gas main along the road outside the property.
 
Should there be no gas mains available along the road outside the property, the laying cost for gas mains will be determined and quoted by Power Gas based on their proposed incoming route.
Upon receiving customers’ confirmation on their interests, City Gas will refer the request to Power Gas and they would need approximately 14 days to revert on the availability of gas mains and actual cost of supplying gas to the premise.
 
On top of this, customers would need to engage a Licensed Gas Service Worker (LGSW) to design and submit the gas plan to City Gas for approval before the installation work.
The list of LGSWs available can be found via the following link:
 
https://elise.ema.gov.sg/elise/findworkerservlet?Operation=GetOffer&Item=GS&selectedType=OFFERG

 
 
Is it worth the hassle? 
 
Thanks bros

Congrats on your upgrade  
 
For dryer, I reckon you won't be able to tell the difference with one of the high efficiency heat pump models.
For heater, I'm afraid there is no easy answer. Instant heaters mostly have very lousy throughput and storage heaters usually take some time to heat up  
Cooking is easy too - just call for someone to deliver the gas canister to you lor.

Thanks, but I haven't bought anything... I used to live in my dad's landed, and for years we never had City Gas, which leads me to wonder why..

The piping work is expensive. Get 2 canisters for cooking, deposit is like 20 or so.

You should tell them you are interested and ask them to quote for the remaining just for kicks.

throughput = ??
 
if water pressure, get an instant heater with electric pump ... I have that for my HDB flat ... works ok.

$35 a tank of gas ... and then every 5 years pay another $90 to replace the regulator valve.

$4700. can pay for many cans of gas! also if you enjoy chinese cooking. LPG gas has more heat capacity that City Gas. makes for a stronger flame and thus "wok hei" when you do stir frying.
 
anyway forget about heat pump dryer. more hassle and any savings. been there done that. besides in a landed just air dry la. no shortage or space to hang clothes, why bother with a dryer?

Any idea if there is addition charges for 3 storey walk up for canister?

If we use cylinders to power heaters and for cooking, I wonder how long do they last? Get those huge tall ones that we find in coffee shops perhaps?

I would rather go for solar panel installation. Although it will cost more to install the energy is free and it's a lot safer. How often do you cook and for how many individuals? You can use it for your water heater, induction cooking stove and even lightings. Got excess power can even sell to electric company.

That may be true, but how does one increase the water pressure? Electric heaters tend to give a slower flow..

Replacement is easy too so I wouldn't get a big one.
That may be true, but how does one increase the water pressure? Electric heaters tend to give a slower flow..That's what I mentioned earlier and some bro said that this can be solved if you buy a heater with a built-in pump. 
Gotta try to know if the pressure is what you want.

And you compare solar power being safer than gas become it should instead be compared to electrical power.

Already have it.
 
I'm talking about both solar and electric power, they are indeed safer dan using those LPG gas tanks.

my bad. maybe read more about it when i have time but quite pointless when I don't stay in landed  
 
So one should instead just focus on comparing the ROI of solar against electrical power.

Solar power installation in Singapore is over priced (like many other products and services).  Financially it doesn't make sense as the payback is something like 15 or 20 years.  To me any thing that doesn't pay back in 3 to 5 years is not worth considering.

15-20 year payback period is okay but must also consider the other risks. Just off the top off my head:
 
1. will the system last 15 years? repair cost considered? cost of changing the storage batteries included?
2. will the house last 15 years?
3. Will the system be supplanted by new and better technologies? Any potential for upgrade?
4. What's the assumptions used for cost of electricity in the future? Are they correct?
5. 15 year investment - opportunity cost for those funds being considered?

mai la. long ROI is a no no in Singapore. the only ones who can take long ROI is the government themselves. their prata flipping these days leaves much to be desired.

$4,700 can probably buy you 5 years worth of portable gas.
 
I was reading induction cooking, about how it was useful for those who cannot use gas for some reasons.
 
For gas heating of water for shower/bath, I also heard some negatives.
 
Overall, imo I'd not pay that connection fee.
There's nothing much to gain.

Nope, it is not worth it to bear the cost of laying gas pipes from the gate to the house if the developer has not included gas into the design. I use canisters purely for cooking.
 
For hot water, I have rooftop solar panels with built-in hot water storage tank. Pressure is ok. However it takes awhile for the warm water to reach the bathrooms below, so there is water wastage. Also there is added maintenance cost to clean the panels, repair rusted pipes and frame. A water pump is necessary for 3-storey houses or high-ceiling houses in order to get water to the roof-top heater and storage tank. Solar heater is still worth it if you have many members in the house, and roof access for maintenance is easy.
 
Another forgotten aspect of mounting anything on the roof is the increased likelihood of water leaks. If there is any hole between pipe and roof covers, rain water will follow the pipe down. The end result is a slow drip and water stain on the false ceilings below.

I wish aircon makers would just add a water tank so the hot air will heat up the water for the shower.
 
All that hot air is really wasted but air con men not smart.

Some smart retailer instead of complaining retail no business, retail no business please bring it in. 
People instead of buying aircon and shower heater can buy just one and save on their monthly bills.
 
Retailers really no imagination only know how to say retail poor.

anyway, some off these guys very easy going ... like the guy who changed my regulator valve yesterday ... told him we did not have $90 cash at home ... he just fixed the thing and told us to call him when we got the money and he will come and collect !!

So is anyone feeding their gas heaters via tanks?
What brand of heaters do you use?
If I get a home, using solar will be a nice idea. 
My dream place will have a nice stream running through it and a meadow around.. saw that in a milkmaid commercial when I was a kid :)
The kids built a dam in it with rocks
 
Anyone recall that?

I can't change the title, but a solar based heater looks very interesting..
Is anyone using it ?
Given that our country is blessed with so much sun (and rain), it seems like a good way to go green. Save a few bucks for my car's petrol too...

my mom goes through one 14kg canister of gas in one month on average. this is with daily cooking of lunch + dinner.
