have stayed in 2 condos so far..as far as i know, the amount of maintenance paid is tagged to your unit size, total amount of units in the development etc etc..

the previous condo i stayed in, maintenance is $300 per mth for a 3+1 unit...the current one, is about the same, but it's 4+1 unit..
 

anyway, i used the facilities quite often..so to me, it's ok

Contribution made comprises of Management Fund (To cater to Operating Expenses of Condo) and Sinking Fund (To meet capital expenditure, Contribution start from First AGM). The amount of contribution payable is based on the Share Value allocated to the respective unit. The larger unit within the condo will have a higher share value. 
 

It is important to look at the status of the Management Fund and Sinking Fund when considering a purchase. A low contribution rate / lower than computed contribution to the Sinking Fund may hint that the Management Corporation will have to impose a levy to made up for any shortfall to fund a capital expenditure (ie: repainting) when the work is due. 
 

MF & SF for an estate of 100-200 units can be in the range of $125 psv/mth

MF & SF for an estate of 200-500 units can be in the range of $75 - $100 psv/mth

The amount of contribution is also much dependance on the type of facilities in the estate. Some facilities / fixtures such as extensive water feature, full air-con lobby, unique facade / high ceiling may hint high maintenance cost or maintenance problem... ...

i stay in one of the condo along upp bt timah..from the cars at the basement carpark, i think quite alot are well to do also...but surprisingly, they are quite friendly once you open up to them..
 

just now, i went down to wash my car..after about 5 mins, 2 other owners joined me at the washing bay and started washing their cars, 1 is driving a lexus RX350 while the other a BMW 3-series..because our tap needs to have the tap keys to turn on, naturally, since i was there first, i used my tap key..they politely asked for my permission before proceeding to use my tap key to fill their buckets with water..and we end up chatting while washing our cars..
 

anyway, if you want to find uncomplicated environment..best is go and retire up north in a kampung..kampung life is still the best..

IMO, very worthy especially when it is also a freehold.

In high rise living, there are many more households and many more different types of people that you will have to cross paths with, like it or not.

As we understand , people do not think alike, some are sincere, geniune while others are rude, self centered and haughty.

However, the chance or possibility of snobbish people in condos is very high becos to begin with, many people today simply clamor to stay in Condos to show that they have made it (despite paying through their noses).

In such a situation, it is difficult to find the condo environment uncomplicated, easy, neighborly and humble cos it's just one big rat-race boiling in there.

It's sadly the same everywhere whether in HDB or private apartments. There are all sorts of characters, considerate, nasty, snobs, Ah Bengs (tattos)even in condos. The lifts at my place got scratched and repainted so many times that they have installed cameras on all lifts. Only then, has the habit stopped.
 

The maintenance fees are paid every quarter (3mths) in advance. At least I dun get strange people knocking at my doors anymore.

Actually, staying in condos has it's plus points. The best of which is sheltered parking with security guards patrolling & 24hr CCTV so you can feel perfectly safe about parking your car there. Another plus is the privacy of the grounds on which the condo is built, can hang-out with friends (provided we're not too noisy!) without fear of the police coming to conduct spotchecks and accusing us of illegal gatherings and what not!   
 

Don't worry about the rude or nonchalent neighbours, Singapore is always lidat one!! Just mind your own business and heck-care the rest, you'll be much less stressed!

Rude neighbors everywhr also have. Even at landed properties. Remember Everitt road? 
 

In fact, I like condo facilities. I've always fancied the idea of going for a swim late at night/in the morning as well as working out in a nice gym after work.
 

Used to always go to my uncle's condo to use the facilities (he always ask me to use it on behalf of him as he does not touch them   )

Not sure how much is the HDB town council fees these days...but if you add in the sheltered carpark fee (~$90) especially if you have 2 cars per household....the difference is much less signficant...
 

 the extra paid can easily go into accounting for the increased security and gym/swimming pool/bbq pits/tennis courts at the doorstep....
 

imagine wake up early morning just pop into the gum for a morning run/workout before going to work.......save on the gym membership (if u are not too picky on equipments and view)......
 

imagine on a hot sweltering day you just change into your swimming gear and go for a dip in the pool.....
 

imagine your friends gathering can be held at the BBQ pits near to the comfort of your home.....save the transport of food and epuipment...after BBQ everyone can adjourn to your home to wash-up and relax.....
 

for those who never enjoyed such benefit will still think to themselves that they don't need these as they have been in HDB setting all their lives........but once you have enjoyed it.....even if you are a lazy slob...you will be more inclined to go running/swimming due to the new found convenience....
 

intangible benefit will be a healthier you.... (subject to individual's health motivation)

Condo plus point only if you have more than 1 car cause you recover part of maintenance fee paid. But minus point is you cant find food outlets and other amenities unless condo is within HDB estates. In condo you dont get and get lesser gahman handouts.
 

Maintenance fee for condo with keep rising in time to come especially manpower cost and other maintenance cost as there is no economy of scale.
 

In condo I dont know what to do when I want to throw my mattress. In HDB I called TC and it will be disposed FOC.

No la, condo also has its perks la.
 

Landed is not all good also:
 

- Rats & insect problem

- Things lost cannot find (too big)

- Always climb up & down (high chance to fall and for old folks...   )

- Easy to kena break ins

- When roof leaks or wall crack (gotta fork out lots of money from own pocket to get contractors to rectify it)

- No sports or recreation facilities (only a handful of cluster housing has it)

- Usually not very convenient for pple who dun drive. 

- Visitors during festivities hard to find carpark.

My condo maint fees is only $150/mth, allow to park one car(2nd car only pay $10) park one or more bikes no problem. got one convenient store in the condo itself. Provide free shutter to MRT/interchange/Shopping mall.

If want to throw mattress, just call the condo cleaner...is that easy!

I think it's more likely the wannabes that are snobbish, those that "think" they are rich, think they have "made it", think they are better.
 

My friend told me when he moving into a resale cheapo suburban condo, he ordered furniture from Ikea, so the Ikea lorry came for delivery, and some kaypo residents just stand by the side and comment loudly about my friend "How can they buy furniture from Ikea? Stay condo still buy Ikea furniture!!??"

I think it's more likely the wannabes that are snobbish, those that "think" they are rich, think they have "made it", think they are better.
 

My friend told me when he moving into a resale cheapo suburban condo, he ordered furniture from Ikea, so the Ikea lorry came for delivery, and some kaypo residents just stand by the side and comment loudly about my friend "How can they buy furniture from Ikea? Stay condo still buy Ikea furniture!!??"
 

Is Ikea too cheapo for condo stayers?????



 

Ikea ok what.

I stay in condo - lots of stuff from Ikea and VHive - cheap and good.

Yah, standard ikea stuff is not great but I usually do not buy the cheapest Ikea pieces.  
 

The better ones (that cost a little more but still relatively affordable) are pretty good.  Got a heavy duty book shelf, very solid construction and I put all my large and heavy coffee table books on it - still very solid after 10 years.

I been to one condo situated at orchard there, worth a few millions dollar per unit, not those condo for the masses. Ppl there very friendly lei, very surprise, i take the lift or waiting for lift they will smile at me etc.... I tot they all rich ppl will be proud and look down on ppl. This is my one time experience there, maybe i heng kena the humble one.



 
 

actually you thought wrongly, dude.

it's usually the opposite.

and it's not just about friendliness, it's a lot about grace.
 

Many HDB owners generally lack grace,  

when they upgrade to mass market condos, they bring this lack of grace along.

go to any mass market condo and you will realise this.

Must be selective at Ikea.

I bot some side drawers.

Good quality wrapped laminate.

$300 for a small side drawer (a normal standard one would be $99)
 

But I was impressed with the quality nonetheless so I grabbed 2 small ones and a bigger one

total $12XX++. (Note that this is about 3 times the price of usual Ikea cheap laminate furniture)
 

I went back to fix them up and realise that each piece was engraved with "made in Italy" and the drawer slides were are branded from Blume , "made in Austria".

So Ikea does sell quality stuff, buyer just need to be selective.  very selective.

It's strange..but perhaps is was as expected.
 

Everyone talked about almost everything that can be found in condos but not FTs!
 

Especially FTs of a certain race...who can't adopt a 'modern' sanitized way of living in a 'higher classed living environment!
 

I read ( with much amusement as well as cringe) in a few blogs of ppl who...to put it rather 'nicely' mention the 'unmentionable aspects' of these suppposedly FTs who bring their ways and culture into common communal spaces...especially at the swimming pool area ..much to the disgust of all who would appreciate a lesser display of such behaviour or none at all!
 

Of course, I guess  only certain condos that are being invaded by such FTs in recent times have had 'such an impact' on some ppl here.  ....
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

================================================================

Ppl tell you almost everything but leave the most important out...so that you can get the 'first hand' taste of what the most important part is and draw your own conclusion, as to whether that part is of the most importance to you!

same sentiment here.  Foreigners usually quite freindly, but not the PRC.  Then again, not many PRC at my place.  cleaners and guards  .  That day when I came home, the guard even update me that they changed the light at my corridor.
 

when staying in hdb, everyone avoid eye contact...when in lift, it was an awkward silence, everyone trying to focus at his/her shoes or the level indicator.

Condo charges are only worth it if
 

you have 1 or more cars in your family

cos HDB is $70 per car? So if have 2 cars

in your family thats $140 already.
 

Better if u use the gym, pool, jacuzzi etc

cos gym is 60 - 80 a month? If 2 adults 

in your home use can save $120 - 160?
 

Best if u use the bbq and function hall once a month

each then u actually start saving money!
 

I pay $280 a month and never use the pool, gym, bbq, hall etc

and just have 1 car so not worth it for me!
 

But not everything can be calculated in money!

no wonder i see them having the "brightest of all" and/or misaligned headlight
 
 

at times, staying in condo is not just about face.. 
 

and neither are those staying in HDB the happiest of all.. some paid dunno how much COV just to buy a HDB.. 
 

to them, it's all about getting a bigger share of govt handout or thinking it's the safest pty investment.. 
 

anyway, each have their own home.

bro.. its not about face, its about security.
 

ask yourself, how much do you trust our MAN IN BLUE to come to your rescue when someone rob you??
 

i work the london hours, and over my 3 yrs of working this hours, i have 4 colleagues all almost got molested and raped when they are walking up/taking lift in HDB flats. And mind you, all of them dropped off the cab just right underneath their block.
 

I am looking to move into a condo too and its not about face at all. At least if my daughter or wife come home late, the taxi will drive them into the condo, thus reducing the risk of being molest and i can sleep with a peace of mind.
 

paying more for security, i find it very worthwhile, considering that our IR is going to open soon and we will be expecting to see a steep increase in robbery cases.

Buying private property is an investment compare with buying car is an expense.  It is a good investment by utilizing your cpf and a bit of cash if you can afford it.  When retire, you can sell off the private property and move back to HDB and still have a good saving.  Security is a secondary issue as not everyone facing security problem when staying in HDB flat.  I stay in a landed and there is no security guard like condo, but I never lock my car at home for the past 10 years and without any issue.  We always leave all the doors open during day time.

what Dumb said doesn't relate in terms of security. what i meant for security is that my wifey and daughter will be safe when coming home late and not leaving 8 fish tank outside the house. The molester or rapist dun rape the fishes!!

It is important to take safety precaution regardless you are staying in condo or HDB.  If someone in the family is coming back late at night, someone should go to downstair or bus stop to wait for her.
 

Singapore is still much safer than many other countries.  I was posted to NY for 2 years previously, no body want to work after 7pm and even the subway station is not safe.

I didn't go to JB that often, only once in a while go there for shopping during weekend.  So far haven't encounter any problem (touch wood).  But I experienced several unhappy occassions in NY city.  Once was taking a taxi from a shopping centre back to my service apartment.  The taxi stop at a side road about 100m away from the apartment and demand me to pay US$100 instead of US$15 for the taxi fare.
 

There are many streets/parks in NY city is almost out of bound after 7pm, e.g. 42nd street, central parks, and one of the residential area north of central park.
 

Some companies there operate their own mini-bus to fetch employee who leave after 7pm to the nearest subway station even if it is just about 5 to 10mins walk.
 

I should say NY in the day time is enjoyable and full of life but not at night in certain area.

The best perks in my opinion are the condo guards...the guards are pretty strict in my condo which is a big plus point for me...
 

Was staying in HDB for over 30 yrs...honestly speaking there is a difference.

my post is not targeted at you. 
 

it's for those who are lulled into complacency by the false sense of security simply because "nothing happened to them even if they are leaving their doors wide open at night"......
 

I'm all for the added security of the condos...... at the very least I feel safer for my wife to return home after parking her car at the carpark late at night after her all girls' outing 

this is compared to when we stayed in HDB some years back....I made it a point to go down to the void deck just to wait for her even though she drives...

agree with you on this....it's like buying insurance... 
 

if nothing happens, those who never buy insurance will say " see, I'm smart because I am sure I will not get this disease or accident"

quite true, but hdb also quite safe, if not safer than condo.



 

How is that true? HDB safer than condo? Perhaps you'll like to illustrate?

Some bought in the previous peak, esp 99 leashold condo has barely recovered, without counting interest cost.



 

So what about those bought at previous low and sitting on/taken monstrous profits?

Good that you hav a fully paid up executive/maisonette flat. 
 

Unfortunately, your money in CPF is making a loss (below the inflation rate).

In fact, thats one very good point about condos. Security & more privacy. Esp for families who have children/ladies coming home late at night.

my post is not targeted at you. 
 

it's for those who are lulled into complacency by the false sense of security simply because "nothing happened to them even if they are leaving their doors wide open at night"......
 

I'm all for the added security of the condos...... at the very least I feel safer for my wife to return home after parking her car at the carpark late at night after her all girls' outing 

this is compared to when we stayed in HDB some years back....I made it a point to go down to the void deck just to wait for her even though she drives...



 

Hehe good for you bro 
 

I did the same last time when I was staying at HBD...made it a point too to go down void deck when my wife was out with gfs and driving back at night.
 

Now feel safer for her to come up herself unless it's really late at night

Even condo can have theft, it was shown in the recent crime watch and was committed by one of the resident.

I have also heard of theft cases from security guards. 

For the swimming pool, is there any lifeguard? I usually went to SAFRA and there's always lifeguard around

Still got to be mindful whether staying in HDB or condo

Sometimes its more like bo pian have to buy condo...

Several years back when looking for house, realised that we did not qualify for new flat/EC. 

Have to buy resale flat. 

Decent locations HDB selling about 500K-600K+ or more with cash top up above valuation, some more 20+ years old and need to spend another 100K to do up. 
 

Its simply a no brainer to spend 300K-400K more and get a  3 year + private condo, with minimal reno needed at a decent location. 
 

Old landed in poorer locations within reach but it is another 200K for extensive reno. 

I was advised that reno cost to minimise as it is very hard to factor in reno cost when selling, cos reno is very subjective. 

Also, the maintenence of a landed is much higher, first hand experience when i was staying with my grandma. 
 

Roof spoilt? 25K. 

Pipes leaking? Knock up floors to repair/replace. 10K

Sliding gate spoil? 5K

Repaint house? 8K
 

I guess you really need to be willing to pay as and when things crop up. Guess only guys like you can pay for all these w/o blinking. Got to be really comfortable for nice landed. Not at that level yet, dun dare wear the big hat.

Condos also have crime, but its lesser or more difficult for someone who wants to commit crime to do it in a condo.
 

Reason simple. HDB is easier target.

Living in condo is not so much about safe or not safe. It's about quality of the environment.
 

Condo usually have managing agent/ security guard who cares about communual property and neigbour behavior.
 

For example, there are lower chances of:
 

Rowdy youths/ drunks / Maid Romeos hanging ard the communual areas at nite.

Neighbours who excessively hog the common corridors with plants/shoe racks

Indiscriminate parking
 

Basically, such behaviour is less tolerated, and there is someone who will be there to tackle the issue almost immediately.

On the flip side, it means that there are a lot more restrictions as well.... And you can be certain to receive a love letter from the mgmt or visit from the security guard when u flout the rules....   
 

But i do admit a lot of these rules are meant to create a more secure, safe and pleasant living environment for the residents. But still you do get people that think it is their birth right to hang their underwear along the balcony for the world to see....

I keep cash so that I can strike should I want to 

I accept the cost of holding cash becos i understand that everything has its price

but when I do strike, I make sure I beat inflation by decades.

look at the number of sellers and units available.

look at the amount of properties out for rental
 

People rush to buy only to sell. 

Like touts outside a cinema in the 80s who actually dont want to see the show but buy up the tickets so that they can sell at higher price.
 

Stuff them, I say.

Think not only condos have inconsiderate neighbours lah, everywhere also sure have one lah! Usually just report to security and make sure security follows up. Lidat, can still maintain annonymity and let the security be the 'pai lang'     ! Haha!




talking about inconsiderate neighbours. 

i'm effin pissed off with my front neighbour.
 

he is so effin thick skinned he always park in front of my gate.

so whenever me, my parents or my bro wanna leave the house we have to ding dong his door bell and ask him to move away. 

i scolded him(lol 20 yo girl scolding 50+ yo uncle) to be more considerate and that there's alot of parking space further up infront. 
 

he just shrugged his shoulders and said 'ok lor'. 

than next day his pattern come back again.

one week have to ding dong his door bell more than 10 times. 

whole family and neighbour also damn pissed off.
 

got once i effin angry already so i just press open the auto gate with his car blocking the way. 

quite funny to see the gate trying to push the car away.

not sure if there were any scratches and i dont effin care.  
 

he is one f'uckin idiot and he always anyhow park his car here and there. 

my left side neighbour also always kena. 

he only has one car and he refuses to park in his own carpark. 

siao one!

 "so much" or "so less" is relative. once u understand this, then there isn't the question of worth it or not. e.g. those soccer stars that earn millions of dollars per year, buys a few hundred thousand dollar 3rd or 4th car for his maid to buy gocery, to him would be still "cheap".  but for me, u tell me a landed freehold 3 storey bungalow in namily selling 300k and ask me to buy, i would still find it expensive.  

so as much as i want to be more culture, more grace, more security, more relax and clean environment... .... next life bah.. ha..ha..

Park infront of your gate?..again and again and again?
 

You staying in landed?.... and you keep on 'resolving' your problems with your neighbour this way?
 

You must be an idiot in life..no offence there.
 

Must be a screwed up product of the Pappy educational system to have produced someone like you.
 

You get kicked around with your rights violated and yet you tolerated it but just keep on cow peh, cow bu all over the island for everyone to know except resolving the problem ..once and for all!
 

No wonder the Pappy can keep all the Sinkies in line.
 

So simple to govern when the Sinkies's mindset is already hampered by their will to voiced up and do something about their personal rights being violated.

Good that you hav a fully paid up executive/maisonette flat. 
 

Unfortunately, your money in CPF is making a loss (below the inflation rate).



 

Whatever the case, the money will grow by at least 10k every year. In 10 years it will be at least 112k and 180k in 15 years.
 

If I were to dumped that together with the sale of my hdb, I can only buy a budget leasehold condo of about 900k of same size. From experience, the price condo may go and down and in 10 to 15 years time, the price will be back to square one if your are lucky. Ask those who bought in the previous peak of 1995/1996. Some are still below water, not counting the amount of interest incurred.

If you can't equate what the issue is ( please read again and again and again....) about what I mentioned is the REAL underlying cause ( although there are other 'contributing factors to it)...

if you have low risk appetite....keeping your $$ in CPF is one of the ways....
 

But you will not get any richer than what the CPF board thinks you should be getting....
 

Yes there is definitely high/low swings in the property prices...given that you can quote the example of the 1995/1996 peak...you should be equipped to enter the property market with a clearer mind than those who forgot about it totally...

Not to say that is a bad idea. But how about putting say maybe 300K into a 500+K 2 bedder <1000sqft suburb condo? The rental will yield more than 2% per annum.
 

Of course there are risk involve as in all investment. There is no such things as gurantee. If you want gurantee, perhaps keeping your money in CPF is the best thing. At least still better than the banks.

The net rent yield of 2% or so indicates that the price of of unit is already on the high side. What's more, besides cost near peak and rental also high. When one or both give way as they will according to history, you will up lorry for several years and if you have no holding power when times are bad, that's it. And when good time returns, you may be back to square one as leasehold suburb units have limited potential as they age. Dont expect enbloc in the future as all new developments have max plot ratio and they are as condensed as HDB.

True, now the price is too hight. Like a bubble. After the bubble burst, might be a good time to think abt investing ur monies in CPF.
 

In fact, my family is looking for a piece of commercial property early this year, but things took a sudden turn and there is a bull run in the property market. Now prices r scary and thus, decide to hold back for the time being. We also have an exec flat that is paid up and we choose not to sell it and put the $ back to CPF. 
 

Been renting out for the past few years and the yield is averaging 5.5% per annum.
