Some frens has suggested to sell and cash out the earning from the 09 /10 units that were purchase.
 
The quantum gain is 300 to 900 K
 
Then stay with parent / rent and look for distress sales
 
My thoughts is can sell, but the TDSR is preventing from buying again based on the loan limit and the age as well as the interest rate.
 
And like some who missed out on the earlier period, the rental of 2.5K to 3.5K for 2 years could have being made for better use to service the loan with the assumsion that the property may appreciate further
 
For me, if I were to sell, I would most likely drop back to HDB and have a nice nest egg for early retirement ...
 
But as the rule is , if you have private, you cannot buy HDB and the gains tax is a killer if you have sold in years before 2000.

Be it renting a whole unit or just room, the monthly amount that you have paid for the rental enough to pay for a house instalment or made for better use in other things. That's why I always feel rental is good for short term but not long term.

can get complicated. the family member may want to imposed on you to hire a maid for the parent as well as bring her for her quarterly medical visit to the hospital as well as pay for the bill ( now got pioneer card so not too bad ) and also make sure that when go on holiday, need to schedule a person for her normal routine.

Saying based on hindsight is easy. There are plenty here overnight become gurus claiming they know just to boost their ego.
 
Others in self denial , claims they know,  often attacking whatever i say. Time and time again only to eat their words,  one example would be light bringer , which claim that nothing will happen back in November when I mentioned hot funds outflow,  only to make a big hooha on dated GDP data telling the whole world of what he knows. Ang mor damn good but inside nothing. Plenty of those people in the corporate world.
 
They are always those which claim they know yet they don't,  emboldened by the power of Google.

I get the feeling that most of us don't like the idea of renting a place to stay in Singapore. Why pay rent and not own the place? We are helping the landlord pay his mortgage on the property!
However, a question then is what if we were to buy our home only to find out that we bought it at a price too high? That has happened to many people before, I am sure. Then, in such an instance, the person who chose to rent instead of buying would have done better.How not to pay a price too high? 

I am sure that there are many things to consider but there is a nice little rule that can make it easier for us to make a decision on whether to rent or to buy."Rule of 15" says that if we could buy a home at a price that is 15 times or less the annual rent a similar property would fetch in the area, it makes more sense to buy than to rent.So, if a two bedroom condominium is selling for $1.5m and the gross annual rent a similar property in the same area is $60k, it makes more sense to rent than to buy. Annual rent of $60k x 15 years = $900k.We can also use this simple rule of thumb to help decide if we would like to put up a property for sale.If we look at it in terms of rental yield, this rule is basically saying that if the gross rental yield of a property is 6.66% or higher, it makes sense to buy and if it is lower, it makes sense to rent.For a while now, we see people buying real estate in Singapore and being quite happy with rental yields of 2+% to 3+%. This is acceptable really only because of the abnormally low interest rate environment. It won't last.The "Rule of 15" is a rough gauge but it is a sensible one as it suggests that a 6.66% gross yield, whether we are owner occupiers or real estate investors, is what we should be looking for to survive more normalised (i.e. higher) interest rates in future. Definitely, it does not take in all factors which are necessary for consideration but it is a nice preliminary check on whether we should buy or rent a home.

It makes more sense to buy than rent when the country is growing and expanding economically. This provides upside for property prices since more people coming into the country to work creates competition for supply. 
 
When the country's economy has plateaued and is struggling to continue growing, and people are leaving the country for greener pastures, this presents downside for property prices through waning demand. It then makes more sense to rent than buy.

So many financial experts saying buy when he price is low.
 
I have one very teeny weeny little question for these financial gurus
 
giving free advice in papers and on blogs.
 
When is it low?
 
I remember one financial editor in a big paper
 
buying his condo in 1996 just before the Asian Financial Crisis.
 
A few year later he wrote in his newspaper.
 
He felt he made the right decision as he liked the place he bought.
 
Some people really say things to make themselves feel better.
 
I am sure he will like the place even more if he paid a much lower
 
price for it.

yeah, the economy still doing very good.
 
Prices are still firm and going sideway of 1 % every month up some months down some months compared to 09 /10 where it have gone up by 30 to 40 %
 
Sibor is going up. Some months down. This month will see if the Fed will raise
 
A much better question would be if we should switch to fixed rate instead of sibor and which bank
 
I went with Stand chart as ease of switching. But heard for Citibank, there is no fees for switching multiple times.

If got money, and you like, buy lah. 
 
The FinanceMinister already said recently that prices are high and CM will not be lifted
 
You heard radio say CM will be lifted? 
I also heard the boy riding skate scooter in the park say CM will be lifted.
You want to believe?

yawns ,when coe at btm it will be a good time to buy car but where is the btm , for one which needs a car absolutely , it is anytime.
 
For those which is not in a hurry to buy car , can take their time.
 
And for those buying a spare car , they can wait for the ones no in a hurry to offload their cars before buying.
 
 
 
--------------------------
 
No massive bankruptcy , personally CM is here to stay if the garmen wants a stable government , i have run many models , all points out that a regulated property market is more sustainable than one which lets market forces come in and goes off causing the local residents to pay for the massive churning.
 
Anyway , letting the prices drop slowly would be better , it is slowly moving down but all we need is another jolt to let prices drop a little sharper and your future generations will thank you for it.
 
It is more than documented that the main cost of living in Singapore is housing and basic needs like food and electricity and water.
 
A high rental is the reason why hawker and coffeeshop food is not cheap , a drop in property prices and rental would indirectly reduce the cost and it is likely to point to a cheaper cost of food.
 
A cheaper flat would mean i have more accessible funds to have children and take care of their daily needs , more money to take care of your elderly parents(less taxing on garmen) and generally a better place for all to stay.

The asset enhancement policy of yore has been a double-edged sword. It has provided a strong source of retirement funds for the older generation but, at the same time, has been causing financial stress for young couples starting their own families.
 
This has been the dilemma faced by the government. Press down too hard on residential property prices (particularly HDB flat prices) and you unsettle the nest eggs of many a retiree. Let prices appreciate and the younger generation is discouraged from buying their own residences, consequently negatively impacting procreation and our Total Fertility Rate.
 
The government has been rolling out new schemes to provide alternative retirement funding for the older generation. The Silver Housing Bonus and Lease Buyback Scheme are two examples of initiatives that have been popping up to wean the population off their intense dependence on their primary residences doubling up as retirement nest-eggs.
 
Post-LKY, it would seem that keeping residential property prices at bay is no longer just a short-term or even mid-term direction change - it has become a long-term goal that has become viable and achievable with the new initiatives kicking in.
 
What does this bode for residential properties here in the long-term?
 
With weakening emphasis on the asset enhancement policy, the government has much more incentive to push for stable property prices that keep pace with inflation (or even head south at certain checkpoints) instead of allowing prices to grow at the same phenomenal rates of yesteryear.
 
Young couples get to purchase housing that are affordable, motivating them to set up families sooner than later. This improves our birth rates and eventually reduces our dependence on imported workers.
 
Coupled with strong economic benefits of a population that spends within its means through the imposition of mechanisms such as TDSR and MSR (two of the most powerful tools within the cooling measure toolbox), it would seem that the days of insanely unsustainable residential property price increases may be over.

4 RM Flat brought in Punngol 300k (2015) from HDB can only sell back to HDB
 
Example yr 2030 you decided to sell your flat and HDB is offering buyer 400k for punngol, you will cash out at 400k.

In my opinion , a 108sqm unit at that kind of (neither here nor there) location is worth only $1250psf max max today.
 
Anything more is "gian png" 
Good luck to those who pay $1500-1600 psf for the mickey mouse units.

Personally worrying about retirement is always a problem if we do not wish to slip in the entitlement policy which govern the "democratic" nations in the west. Many are burdened by debt by entitlement programs like pensions and inconceivable tax reductions and stuff. Many win votes with promise of further "entitlements" which they cannot back away from and our country is slowly moving toward this model.
 
If you want retirement to be smoother , first be open on the losses on the various failed investment on financial institution and be transparent on how much losses you have actually made , not push the ball forward and delay the entitlement of the CPF rightful entitlement. I can afford f**k ups in investments and they make clear about it and i can make additional savings to cover that loss than to push the ball further down and risk and a total meltdown via various taxation schemes to "try" make it back.
 
-------------------------------------
 
I have seen many ponzi schemes behaving non transparent , though i do not suggest that our CPF is one but one will be suspicious when:
 
1. I will need to set aside a minimum of $161,000 as of now and growing each year when our wage isn't growing according to inflation. Personally i would think , for 161,000 it is rather ridiculous as this is as good as a the average networth of 3 individuals in the western world. That's not including the other assets like our own personal savings and properties.Yes , annuities are good way to protect the future but if my money is in "an investment" shouldn't transparency be a priority? I do not need a statement to tell me what you invested this year but at least 2 years ago should be fair.
 
2. For those retirees which have built the nation , when the government claims they made X% over the year , yet not entitled to reap the benefits of their "initial" investments still having to "toll" after their effective working years.

3.  If you have at least $60,000 in your Retirement Account at 65, you will be placed on CPF LIFE.  Why should i need someone to decide for me when i reach 65 , if i decide to take my money , should it be my entitlement ? In one way , i do agree of a paternal way where the garmen should take care of us but in another way , why should they decide on everything and not give us an option to totally opt out. If we decide to "opt" out then how? It is not like i have never paid taxes like GST , ERP and basic income tax. Why can't i decide on how my money is being spent? 
 
4. No guarantee with their heads on the chopping board when screw ups happen , one example , if the MRT screw up , why can't our garmen take funds from the "provisional" funds to close up partially a few stations at a time to fix it and provide bus services for those lines to link up. As long as we are informed early , we can  make plans for it. You mean our country don't even have the "budget" to do such things? So where is the 50% of what our finance minister claims set aside used for over the years?
 
 
I might sound damning , but the more i analyze , the more worrying i am on where my life savings go to. Though i have made plans for those savings to be gone but i am worried for those people which might not be prepared when eventually the ones responsible take their bags and go and still collect a fat pay check over the years , one e.g Saw Phaik Hwa. Do she even need to take MRT ?

 
 
 
4 RM Flat brought in Punngol 300k (2015) from HDB can only sell back to HDB
 
Example yr 2030 you decided to sell your flat and HDB is offering buyer 400k for punngol, you will cash out at 400k.

 
so no COVs and no agent fees? Will it create unhappiness for those which paid more on higher levels ?
 
Personally i see a problem over the long term but it is not my problem come 2030 and beyond , in the event where the seller refuses to sell for such a price and sit on it and enters a personal agreement. It will become messy especially with crooked agents all over. Anyway , good that you bring it up.

It's an interesting question why the Govt keeps delaying the CPF payout even though it obviously has the funds to pay each individual the sum accumulated. It's not a simple matter as losses and therefore the need to top up the loss by withholding funds, aka Ponzi fund.
 
My thoughts at this juncture (not verified) are that this is tied to dynamic issues like ageing population. The primary problem is the largest group by proportion (baby boomers) reaching retirement age. The issue is two-fold. First, the retirees means a large proportion of workers exiting the workforce, and result in further strain on the already tight labour market, and a resultant drop in GDP if the numbers are not replenished. Second, their healthcare costs (part of which are dealt with by the Pioneer package) means a greater stress (tax burden) on every individual non-retiree worker to support the retirees as a whole. 
 
The simple solution is to temporarily increase the foreign workforce to sustain the group until a time when the numbers start to drop (say maybe when the Gen X retires) before reduction of foreign workforce. But we all know how accepting thee population is about this strategy.
 
Delaying the impending retirement age and CPF payout for the baby boomers is a means to keep as many of them working for as long as possible to evade the problems of the largest group by proportion retiring. My two cents only.
 
 

 
Personally worrying about retirement is always a problem if we do not wish to slip in the entitlement policy which govern the "democratic" nations in the west. Many are burdened by debt by entitlement programs like pensions and inconceivable tax reductions and stuff. Many win votes with promise of further "entitlements" which they cannot back away from and our country is slowly moving toward this model.
 
If you want retirement to be smoother , first be open on the losses on the various failed investment on financial institution and be transparent on how much losses you have actually made , not push the ball forward and delay the entitlement of the CPF rightful entitlement. I can afford f**k ups in investments and they make clear about it and i can make additional savings to cover that loss than to push the ball further down and risk and a total meltdown via various taxation schemes to "try" make it back.
 
-------------------------------------
 
I have seen many ponzi schemes behaving non transparent , though i do not suggest that our CPF is one but one will be suspicious when:
 
1. I will need to set aside a minimum of $161,000 as of now and growing each year when our wage isn't growing according to inflation. Personally i would think , for 161,000 it is rather ridiculous as this is as good as a the average networth of 3 individuals in the western world. That's not including the other assets like our own personal savings and properties.Yes , annuities are good way to protect the future but if my money is in "an investment" shouldn't transparency be a priority? I do not need a statement to tell me what you invested this year but at least 2 years ago should be fair.
 
2. For those retirees which have built the nation , when the government claims they made X% over the year , yet not entitled to reap the benefits of their "initial" investments still having to "toll" after their effective working years. I cite an example , a person with an initial amount of 1k and a subsequent monthly deposit of 250 with just 5% compounding would have made the investment worth on 25years : 152358.71.

Yes i do agree of an aging population of the baby boomers would represent a large chunk, but if we keep looking at the aging part and not looking towards adding more babies , won't the aging population be eternally a problem? We can't forever depend on foreign workers to "fill" in the gaps as they are many in this category which doesn't pay tax too.
 
By increasing the competitiveness of a lower cost of maintaining a business via lower rentals cost and lower wages yet a relatively highly skilled workforce is more important than making a few agents happy. There is a reasonable amount of engineers getting out of jobs simply because most of those jobs has being outsource out of singapore due to rapid rental increase and higher wage demands.
 
Reason again higher property prices and greater greed. Again not realistic expectations with no fundamental backing and myopic projects by our leadership in failure to bring in more jobs.
 
Mind you , we aren't attracting top talents , many top bankers have moved on to other pastures where Facta doesn't hinder whatever you do. As for the medical pharmacies and related industries , they aren't here yet.Even so , many sgporeans are complaining their jobs are being taken away from them. So how? Your solution on covering the medical or the tax burden might come to nothing since most middle class pay next to nothing for taxes other than the typical GST , ERPs etc.
 
To me , the baby boomers are equiped with probably more surivival skills since they are the ones which were born just after the war and when the country had almost next to nothing. If they need to work , they will work regardless what the legal retirement age is. Most of them are realistic in their expectations unlike the strawberry gen and below. Many can make do with whatever they lay their hands on and they are likely the generation which i worry least about.
 
To me , delay cpf payout and setting the official retirement age is two seperate issues , who is stopping anyone from working after you get your payout? It is an individual choice right? IF they think their payout isn't enough or savings isn't enough , regardless whether if you reached your retirement age or not , they will still need to work to survive. Am i right ?
 
 
Back the the issue on rent or sell, i believe our HDBs is a lease hold which means we are "rentïng" it from HDB. It is not a freehold if i am not wrong. So unless everyone here is staying in a landed freehold else the question actually is quite mentally challenging to answer. As for selling , you guys are too late behind the curve. Peak prices were almost 2 years ago when we are crying fowl.

Certainly we can't depend on foreign influx to continually plug in gaps. This should be a transient feature until we can stabilise the situation. At the same time, we must boost our birth rate. But note that babies also do not contribute to GDP or pay taxes directly. They take 20-25 years before they help to contribute directly to GDP and/or sustain tax burden.
 
If we cannot attract the top tier talents, we must attract the second tier from the top. This is beneficial both from economic points of view and in terms of our long term gene pool as a population.
 
And in the meantime, we cannot ask the seniors to leave our country. We must ensure the best quality of life possible for each of them despite their paying lower taxes and overall medical burdens. With seniors and juniors out of the equation in GDP and tax paying, who will be the ones who must work much harder (be much more productive), as well as pay much more taxes, while they pay for the living expenditures of the seniors and the juniors?
 
Your question is about withholding CPF so let's just stay on the issues directly associated. I am sure there are the responsible baby boomers that work as long as they can, but two issues persist. There is a huge group that chooses not to work if they can afford not to. I have seen relatives strike a couple hundred thousands 4D and tried to retire, gamble away their time and money, and end up empty-handed. Some other groups as well who will let their children take care of them, which is not bad, but like I mentioned, result in the removal of a large number of workers from all strata in an already strained labour market.
 
At a personal level, I prefer to withdraw all my CPF when I can, but I fully understand the Govt's point of view.
 
Whether to sell and rent largely depends on individual situations and their personal circumstances. We are in no position to judge for others. They will have to do the Math themselves - it's too complicated to discuss fruitfully here.

1. Now , i would like to correct on the boosting of babies. Child and childcare related industries is a booming business in the same way elder health care would be as our population grows old. In a certain way , the more chidren we have, the more they contribute to the GDP in terms of jobs creation and investments. It is also documentated that most people with children tend of have a high saving to income ratio than a single or couple without children. This in turn creates more opportunities for future growth than a pure consuption based  economy.
 
As for our baby boomers which are mostly engineering trained(due to rapid industrialization) and production related industries grow old , keeping them in working condition yet no job availiable doesn't make sense unless they are willing to go for a job redesign/retraining. Else there are limited things they can do. I am not suggesting them to move out , they can still keep their place here but i would think they can consider the cost of living elsewhere. It is likely to be a better alternative in terms of quality of life as compared to living here where basic cost of living is increasing.
 
-----------------------------------------------
 
2. As for the part about not attracting top tiered talents, I have seem countless examples of so called foreign imports (students  graduating from scholarships) bursting in flames when shit hits the fans , it is always the ones which served NS or locally born ladies which puts in effort and self initial to solve problems and have enough grit to grind it out.
 
These (sub standard) paper chasers are highly likely the be the ones hiding and pushing arrows all over. All being said, i would think if we cannot attract the top talents , then it would be better to focus on developing your own "top" talents rather than to waste them in official post like ARMY or NAVY or even A-star. Let these people fight it out in the real corporate world. There are many intelligent children in singapore ,many are wasted in local programs which don't maximise their talents as our garmen only looks out and never look inwards.
 
----------------------------------------------------
 
3. As for my question on CPF , you have yet to answer my question. As you stated , you have seen people waste their windfall gains , it is a personal choice. Did you benefit from their windfall ? If the answer is no , then why do you have the need to be responsible for his sorry plight. Now i did mention, the issue is the money is not the garmen's in the first place so how the person wants to use it , is not of their concern .
 
Whether or not that fellow decides to work or not after he gets his money also doesn't really depends on how much money he or her have. I stopped "working" early this year and went on sabbatical, i am in my 30s , i do have enough to survive til i die. But does it mean i will no longer work in the future? The answer is no , i will have to work if circumstances require me to.
 
If you think the garmen needs to even decide everything for them , then why don't they also decide on what food they should eat and drink and who to f**k and not give them a choice? So that they can live healthier. This to me is still crap.
 
As for the math ,let's just assume i have done enough math and modeling to know what i am doing.

I can only congratulate you for your very high SES to begin with. You are looking at the other side of the coin I am staring at.
 
1. My point is by all means encourage domestic growth via babies. But if purely dependent on babies plus letting the population age and retire without increasing foreign workforce, it means we will have to depend hugely on the shoulders of those within working age to shoulder all the working hours plus taxes. It just means everyone else who has to work has to work more hours and pay more taxes. It's as simple as that. Call it employment or GNI per capita if GDP does not cut it for you.
 
Most of the baby boomers I know and refer to are those earning between 1-2K per month. The moment they stop working, the Govt and their working families will have to shoulder all their expenses. You can say if they squander away everything, let them! Yes, but do read the GE2015 thread to see how pictures of homeless people who looked as if they lost everything are posted online to say that the Govt does not care for them.
 
2. This is dependent on the industry you refer to. Again, I am referring to a broad spectrum of jobs and not just scholar type. We need all more people, in service industries especially and some specialised industries for which we lack the specialty currently (my opinion). Without them supporting your so-called intelligent children, many possibilities become cut off. 
 
3. Some of these people who squander away everything are my relatives and they just come borrowing nonstop even after you stated your stand. You admit that you have to work if circumstances in future require you to. Supposing you do not even have the income to stop working, or there is no parental support, would you actually have stopped working? Would you have checked that another job avails before you jumped over? And supposing they are out of the industry for years, would there be a job that they fit and they like in the future?
 
I know also because I have had the thought before, but I have had to keep running the hamster wheel because the choice never really existed for me. At least not yet.
 
So there. I congratulate you for having the choice and taking it.

Yup I agree that the Govt should stop over-babying the old folks.
Give them their CPF, if they should lose it all to sweet talking china girls or the casino and left to loiter in the streets and parks, arrest them and lock them up!  Fine their children too for not taking care of them in that process.  
 
Muayhahahaha......
 
 
Those who think it is so simple, must think again.
The key is to find the balance.
And it is a difficult delicate one.

So many financial experts saying buy when he price is low.
 
I have one very teeny weeny little question for these financial gurus
 
giving free advice in papers and on blogs.
 
When is it low?
 
I remember one financial editor in a big paper
 
buying his condo in 1996 just before the Asian Financial Crisis.
 
A few year later he wrote in his newspaper.
 
He felt he made the right decision as he liked the place he bought.
 
Some people really say things to make themselves feel better.
 
I am sure he will like the place even more if he paid a much lower
 
price for it.
 
 

 
LOL
 
just like what i hear from some iskandar investors
 
cannot rent just treat it as holiday home lor
 
after staying for 2 times, they haven't been back since
 
now they only know how to    Najib

After your worded attempt I know roughly where you stand in terms of debating rationally, haha ok I can stoop to your level as you simply cannot look a little forward on what notion I am trying to say and taking it selectively. As for SES , there is 147 acronyms on this , given my limited iq , i only know a korean pop band and social economic status. So assuming it is the latter, i will answer you simply , a bowl of prawn mee made of pork ribs is 3 bucks in a hawker centre while a bowl of ramen made from pork ribs cost easily 20 bucks for that same bowl depends on the lifestyle of the individual. Many here know my background , i have no need to explain on this.
 
On looking on both side of the coin , i have already explored both side in fact even the ones in between.
 
I cite an example : Our forefathers which had many children and do you think the financial burden on them was light coming out of war and many lose their husbands,brothers ,fathers? Did they whine like you? GDP works in many ways , spending it on the old is unrecoverable expenses which reaps no rewards , Singapore has already proven that investing in your future generation will reap better benefits. They also proved that if one worked hard enough, they would have accumulated enough to last them a lifetime.
 
I didn't suggested that they shouldn't work after they gotten back their cpf. I am asking who determines what age they should work to? The person decides his or her own fate. Your way of saying it is, if you keep them in the work force by withholding their life savings will reduce the burden of the children? What is wrong with taking care of your parents or anyone which taken care of you when you are young?
 
Imagine if your children is going to tell you to work til 75 and above in the future since they cannot afford to pay for your expenses , you ok ah? While people failed to plan for more children in the same way, it is an economic choice they made so why is others made to pay for it? You mean in other countries in Asean they pay for it your old age? If not , i don't see how your reference is even correct in the first place.
 
By the way , results for the recent GE has already proven , Singaporeans are pussies , while they complain alot online and attend rallies and show their "support". When it comes to voting , the end results are clear. So your first point is gone. As for homeless people , i think you are really myopic in your views , Singapore is not utopia , you should try to go overseas probably even to Indonesia or Vietnam to see what it means to be homeless and helpless. Again proven you have not being well heeled and well informed to debate me on this.
 
LKT spent a whole lifetime trying to change the entitlement mentality of developed worlds while keeping its core efficiency in the capitalist model and I have done a fair amount of research in its economic effects and negativity of a overly paternalistic state.
 
Just look at Venezuela,knowing your standard I know I am wasting my time as you behave exactly like those scholars which talk a lot of alien language but get nothing done and hope nothing happens and push it to the next fellow.
 
I have clearly mentioned about the willingness on job redesign and retraining .As for industry and whatever you say depends on , then please clearly state to me the ratio of your so called claims on the various industres before you counter me. Are those the majority? If you cannot , then it is just another baseless assumption yet again.
 
As for borrowing , unless you are the kind of showoff that tells the whole world how much you have? Else why do people go to you to borrow money? That said if you have made enough effort helping them then why bother if you can't lend them any further. Judging on what you said , it is likely you are just trying push your responsibilities away. To me , it is a little selfish on your thinking but i am sure you are not the only one thinking this way.
 
 

I can only congratulate you for your very high SES to begin with. You are looking at the other side of the coin I am staring at.
 
1. My point is by all means encourage domestic growth via babies. But if purely dependent on babies plus letting the population age and retire without increasing foreign workforce, it means we will have to depend hugely on the shoulders of those within working age to shoulder all the working hours plus taxes. It just means everyone else who has to work has to work more hours and pay more taxes. It's as simple as that. Call it employment or GNI per capita if GDP does not cut it for you.
 
Most of the baby boomers I know and refer to are those earning between 1-2K per month. The moment they stop working, the Govt and their working families will have to shoulder all their expenses. You can say if they squander away everything, let them! Yes, but do read the GE2015 thread to see how pictures of homeless people who looked as if they lost everything are posted online to say that the Govt does not care for them.
 
2. This is dependent on the industry you refer to. Again, I am referring to a broad spectrum of jobs and not just scholar type. We need all more people, in service industries especially and some specialised industries for which we lack the specialty currently (my opinion). Without them supporting your so-called intelligent children, many possibilities become cut off. 
 
3. Some of these people who squander away everything are my relatives and they just come borrowing nonstop even after you stated your stand. You admit that you have to work if circumstances in future require you to. Supposing you do not even have the income to stop working, or there is no parental support, would you actually have stopped working? Would you have checked that another job avails before you jumped over? And supposing they are out of the industry for years, would there be a job that they fit and they like in the future?
 
I know also because I have had the thought before, but I have had to keep running the hamster wheel because the choice never really existed for me. At least not yet.
 
So there. I congratulate you for having the choice and taking it.

There is no intention to debate rationally or otherwise. Merely pointing out my observations. 
 
I can't say I speak for majority but even the minority matters. Why I concluded on the SES level is because nobody behaves like that in your social circle - they are capable of self check. Not mine.
 
For the record, not only do some of us have dependants above and below, we cannot afford to take a step off the racing wheel not because of pork rib noodles, but because of health care, insurance, childcare costs etc which constitutes bulk of expenses, not counting transport and enrichment. 
 
That's why I still congratulate you for having the luxury to take a step back. Not in jest, just a different world we live in.

Gov rental flat can be as cheap as 30 plus a month. I see a fair share of ppl taking advantage of gov help and choose to stay at home and practical do nothing. To me we are not helping them, but creating a slow death situation. 
 
If cpf is given back to all at 55 we will see these group of people increasing, definetly not the entire population will squander their money away, but definitely a small percentage will.

Agree on whatever you said but then again you do not know how hard i worked to achieve that and merely focus on the end result.
 
I had my fair share of relatives/friends with gambling/vices debts , fact is you won't be able to help them unless they help themselves. One fact , if i lend them money to gamble away i might as well use it to gamble myself but if it is for sickness or really not enough , i will always go out of my way to make it happen for them. In fact , i have paid off medical bills for strangers before just not long ago while i was traveling and doing volunteer work.
 
Health care , child care and any other cost is a varable fixed cost , which can be controlled. For insurance , medical insurance is the single most important factor which can be paid using medisave and nothing from cash.I have not recieved any "enrichment" programs , but does it mean i did worse than my peers? Again personal choice , don't blame it on others.
 
Again goes back to the fact similar to the noodles you eat and how much you willing to pay for it.

Health care is a fixed cost until you or loved ones get seriously sick. Childcare cost is a fixed one too that goes up every year. The cost situation can't be perfectly controlled. 
 
Not just relatives, some army friends also behave that way. If we can be assured that no one will take advantage of early CPF withdrawals, I think Govt might have stuck to it. Even a 5% failure and 1 person sleeping on the street is not really acceptable for most Singaporeans. 
 
I am sorry to have prejudged your situation. If just focus on pork noodles and no dependants I think I can probably retire now too.

Failure to set aside for them is a personal choice, if you can afford to buy a car, go for a family travel, then afford to waste your time reading and debating with me, then I find it little reason that you will not have enough for your loved ones in the event they are sick or any other extra ordinary factors which might affect.Again, what makes you think I do not have dependants, by merely staying with my parents would meant I don't ? Dude, don't be so limited in your reasoning, the problems you have most of us have , just only see how you going to sort it out.
 
Child care expenses drop the moment you send them to primary school , unless you are those kiasu parent which don't wanna spend time to educate your child and just hand the responsiblity to others so that you have an easy way out. Else it is unlikely to see an increase in cost.I agree whatever you have highlighted are realistic problems but in one way solvable as long as proper budget is set aside but if you wanna complain that because my loved ones is sick and I have do not have spare money due to expenses on my own wants thus now it is a burden for me to bear those and blame it on the garmen leave the problem for them to solve , then it is not going to be fair either way.

I have excluded non absolute essentials in the previous post. 
 
Medical cover is not 100% from CPF. I think main breadwinners can see my viewpoints clearly about childcare and insurance. Just these two can make me work another 10 to 15 years.
 
We are from vastly different situations - this I am absolutely sure.

I certainly agree we might be facing different situations and thus we see things from a different view. It is just how we make best of our situations and not blame push the blame to others.
 
Sorry my insurance bill runs in thousands every year too, but most of the time it will still not be 100% , this is how agents wants to make you think. We can discuss this on a seperate thread but this to me is still a controllable cost.
 
Childcare slightly lesser due to garmen subsidy as i am jobless to them. To me the early years have a variable cost in the providers , a pap childcare would be different from non government childcare and as i mentioned cost has increase to due inflation in rental and wage cost. An child care centre rental can go above 80k per month in certain areas and this will inevitably be transfered to the parents.
 
Thats is my reason why a drop in cost of rental and property prices will benefit us as a whole over the long run.
 
That said , still doesn't justify them withholding my cpf. All you need to do is to adjust the retirement age to a flexible where people can decide at 62 or 55.
 
 
I have included some cut out from a website on the cost.
 
In Singapore, there is no standard fee structure for kindergartens. Each kindergarten will charge parents differently; even for kindergartens under the same name such PCF kindergartens, monthly fee will vary from branch to branch. In this article, we try to show readers a typical fee structure of kindergartens in Singapore.
Please be informed that you can use your child's Child Development Account to pay for your child's school fee.
 
1. Monthly Fee
Nursery: Lowest monthly fee is $48 at some PCF kindergartens. Highest monthly fee is $1800; median monthly fee is $180, and average monthly fee is $232.
PCF Kindergartens charge a monthly fee that range from $48 to $210.
 
Kindergarten 1: Lowest monthly fee is $74.9 at some PCF kindergartens. Highest monthly fee is $1800; median monthly fee is at $180 and average monthly fee is at $249. PCF Kindergartens' monthly fee ranges from $74.9 to $350.
PCF Kindergartens charge a monthly fee that can range from $74.9 to $350.
 
Kindergarten 2: Lowest monthly fee is $74.9 at some PCF kindergartens. Highest monthly fee is $1800; median monthly fee is $180 and average monthly fee is $250.
PCF Kindergartens charge a monthly fee that can range from $74.9 to $350.
 
Note: PCF Kindergartens have a different monthly fee for Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Foreigners. For example, in one PCF kindergarten in the north, monthly fee for Kindergarten 1 and 2 for Singapore Citizens is $160, permanent residents need to pay $172 and foreigner $220.
 
2. Registration Fee
Almost all kindergarten will charge a registration fee which may range from $15 to more than $60
.
3. Uniform Fee
All kindergartens will also require students to pay for the school uniforms.
One set of uniform may cost $15 per set at some PCF kindergarten. Other kindergartens usually charge higher.
PE attire is also needed and it is usually cheaper. It is about $10 at some PCF kindergartens.
 
4. Material or Book Fees
Students are also required to pay for the study material such as reading books, workbooks or other study materials that are used in the kindergarten.
 
5. Miscellaneous fee
Miscellaneous fee may cover insurance or stationery used during the lessons. It is usually collected two times in a year.
At some PCF kindergarten, this amount may be at about $70. Exact amount will vary from kindergarten to kindergarten.
 
6. Deposit
Kindergarten operators may ask you to pay a deposit when you enroll your child into the kindergarten. Amount may vary from kindergarten to kindergarten.
 
7. Enrichment Program
Some kindergartens offer enrichment programs which parents need to pay in order for their children to join these optional programs

my childcare increase $50 a year... but in a way this is offset with the cheaper milk powder and less pampers used as a child get older..
 
other than that.... I dunno what other increase there are........besides the monthly fee... still got other thing to pay for childcare?
 
I do agree with CH_CO... if everyone makes some afford to keep some money for rainy day rather than splurge on luxury items like car, holidays, eating at restaurants, changing of latest handphone, etc... actually Singapore is very liveable...
 
PS: I dunno what you all discussing about.... retirement , poor people or what....

Sorry we have deviated from topic. The current question is, with the amount you have saved, do you think you can choose to stop working for a period of time until you think it is necessary to start again?

i chao ah beng arguing in a hawker centre leh. Simi scholar , my england so bad i need to use a whole paragraph to explain simple things which i probably use 1 sentense.
 
Boh lui mai pua , ai pua mai kai si , su liaoz kao peh kao bu zho si mi.
 
As for properties , i will not sell the home i am staying at regardless the price unless i kana emblocked.
 
But as for properties i own , i have no issues selling them if prices are good and if i think price trends are going to continue to detriorate against my favor and so much that even rental income will not cover then i will get out too.
 
As for selling my primary residence in view of a lower price , personally i find it silly as it is a gamble with no timeline , unless you can tell me u zhun zhun tell me the projected price of the property u are looking for and there will confirm be a seller for you.
 
Even so , for the waiting time , you will be paying rental cost probably in the range of 3-7% of the property price. Let's say if you sold at 2013 and waited til 2016 to buy , the cost of waiting can range up from 9%~21% depending on location.
 
If the market only tanks by 30~50% on the optimistic view how much potentially are you going to profit from it? Do your own calculations.

Depends on your expenses(X) , price in alot of allowance(A) for (inflation + rainy day) and multiple by 2 to the projected years(Y) you might be alive.
 
(X+A) * Y * 2 = Amount
 
If any part of the equation changes , then considerations can be made. Or if one becomes too bored at home , he can also continue to work. It is always an choice given to the individual.

To be honest, not pushing any blame. 
 
We work for the kind of lifestyle we aim for amidst the pressures and expectations surrounding. 
 
I am happy to work but the choice to stop work and look / queue / wait for a childcare space in a PCF childcare somewhere far away, shouldering the medical expenses etc just feels too daunting. I am sorry for appearing that I blame anyone. I don't. I am just emphasising that the insecurity keeps most people going on, and it's still beneficial to the economy by retaining every additional working person.

I have piece of small advice. If you have only one property and you and your family live in it, don't think of selling and buying back later to big some gain. 
 
If your are rich and can afford more than one properties, you can flip them they way you wish. There will always be new high in my opinion. Singapore is  tiny dot, there is no way for property to go downwards forever. Today prices are way too high but it will be the low of tomorrow and future.
