Cannot tahan our own HDB....MBT juz mentions that HDB remained affordable; indicating statistic shows that pricing of HDB is line with household income.
 
I somehow sympathise our younger generation. They are forced to buy expensive flats and yet our govt agency is singing bird song and asking them to "buy within their means".
 
_______________________________
 
 
SINGAPORE : The Housing and Development Board (HDB) will continue to keep tabs on flat owners who default on their HDB mortgage payments. 
 
It stressed that long term measures to help these owners manage their mortgage payment is the best solution, and that compulsory acquisition of the flat is a last resort. 
 
As of October 2008, some 33,000 flat owners owed HDB arrears of three months or more. They make up less than 8 per cent of the 420,000 households with outstanding HDB loans. 
 
Giving this update in Parliament on Tuesday, Parliamentary Secretary for National Development Mohamad Maliki Osman said home owners should buy within their means. 
 
But he recognised that there are some who are affected by the economic downturn and one option for them is to downgrade to a smaller unit. 
 
More 2 and 3-room HDB flats will be coming on stream next year to cope with the growing demand for smaller flats. 
 
Dr Maliki also said heavily subsidised rental flats should be given to those who are in dire need. - CNA /ls

How to buy within their means..3 room flat oso cost nearly $300K or more if in good location.
 
Its HDB fault in allowing valuation in open market to shoot p so high,so at least give them an opportunity to raise their selling price.
 
I always feel that HDB should not allow cash over valuation. Flat already valued by "licensed" valuers..its the flat value already..

everything in sg is priced at the highest amount to stop people from over consumption.
petrol at price that deter you from driving more than you have to.
public transport fares priced at more than you want to travel an additional trip.
hospital bills at more than you can stay an additional half day.
housing price at more than you can have spare cash to renovate.
car price at more than you can pay off at the end of 10 years.
 
whats new.

Anyway, do you guys expect HDB prices to fall next year? I suppose when resale prices start to dip, hdb would have to adjust accordingly for the new flat prices? Question is... will they start to hold back releases of 4/5 rms flats in prime locations since those are their money trees?

...I always feel that HDB should not allow cash over valuation. Flat already valued by "licensed" valuers..its the flat value already..There is nothing wrong in cash over valuation....it's a sensible way to trade....especially if there is more than 1 potential buyer. Seller will sell to whoever can pay the highest. 
I feel the problems lies with both HDB and buyers. I feel HDB should really provide near-to cost housing. Buyers on the other hand also have to work out their budget well and factor in a possible lost of income and other expensese, etc...

300k huh.....Some of the flats are Park Central or Duxton cost about 500k or 600k. And HDB capped the salary limit of buyers to 8k. How do these buyers pay a flat worth 500k to 600k with a maximum salary of 8k? 
 
Impliedly, you are making these buyers to continue working until they die.

I think many ppl wanted to get a 3-room flat but at some point of time there were no new 3rm available for sale, only 4~5rm. Like kenna forced to upgrade.
 
Now they say ppl should buy within their means  . For this economic downturn it shows us the true colours of u-know-who. I wonder how about the numbers on those who took bank loans.

If I have a chance to voice my qns to MBT at the parliament, I would like to know his definition on "affordable" and his basis of justifying the public housing to go in line with household income.
 
Even our health minister KBW was speaking about mean testing, saying that the mean testing is a complex exercise to siphon patients whom do not qualify for Ward C subsidy.
 
I do not advocate mean testing for ppl buying public housing; I only think MBT is giving a lame excuse.

i understand DBSS flat is better quality than 'standard' HDB flat but is it necessarily  expensive (ie: 3x the price) ? the world is progressing and improving, better product does not mean higher cost right ?
 
compare current computer vs 3 years ago. 
compare current car vs 3 years ago. 
compare current electronic goods (ie: plasma tv, fridge, cooker, etc) vs 3 years ago
 
all the above current items are far more complex and equipped with tons of added functions but do their price 3x more expensive than previous one ? it is almost the same price or even cheaper.

I agree. That is the stupid thing about the 8K salary cap. Y can't they just lift the salary cap based on each 100K? Eg... flats <=400K, 8K cap. >400, 9K cap. >500, 10K cap.
 
In this way, they would make it fair for all.

Resale market is a different issue. It is between willing buyer and seller. The market force determines the final price.
 
New public housing is a completely different thing. In the past, ppl make $$ selling their 5 years-old HDB and "upgraded". Then the same ppl will apply for another new HDB and enjoy the "2nd bite of the cherry". Govt is not very happy about ppl making $$ and leave govt with many unsold flats during the last downturn. Many regulation have put in place to curb this.
 
That will explain our great leaders with expensive flats to make ppl slave for 30 years.

If HDB is really very affordable, you would not be monitoring bi-weekly COE price, would you?
 
But again if you are eyeing the $2m condo in downtown, surely $300k is very affordable.

in this case selling at a loss (300k), still need to pay resale levy 40k(for 4rm flat) to HDB ?
if still need to pay resale levy 40k, then loss become 55k + 40k = 95k....
 
so this still call subsidize flat ?  
 
maybe can call suicide flat

He likes to paint a beautiful picture..... 
Think he think he is still talking to pple from the 80s?
 
Why should 2-3 rm flat be built in the prime district (300k )? Since they are for family who is downgrading or facing financial difficulties, it should be as cheap as possible...location is NOT their main concern...$$$ is.
 
As in ST today "Our public housing, that are PRICED below market rate, is affordable as avg owner use less than a quarter of their monthly household income for their mortage which is below international benchmark of 30%."
 
 
Based on what statistic ? 
Who conducted and work out the statistic? 
Are we comparing apple to apple ? 
International benchmark is based on our pigeon hole (now becoming more like for sparrow only coz pigeon is fatter  ) vs landed property used in the internataionl benchmark
How much is your salary here and in other country for doing the same thing , Is the international benchmark a FAIR one?
 
Please please talk sense..and back up "the medicine" you are selling...Dun simply grab some statistic that seems and sounds very favourable to you and your point that you are trying to make. Pple will recognise and respect leader who shows empathy to their followers not someone who think that they are a good leader (to their bossess)

Sometime do not know what they are digressing.. the things mentioned mean nothing in short. This is especially true for thoose couple getting married. No priority given and yet encourage to marriage, born baby. buy flat have to ballot and pay $10 for 'lucky draw'. Often, the demand exceed the supply and its difficult to be allocated a flat. Even if you succeed also depend on your queue no. If you queue no is those at the back, you will have no chance of choosing you preferred flat. Buy resale is madness. Have to fork up cash upfront. Instead of giving priority to newly wed couple, they tell you to opt for 'lucky draw'. When all things came to naught, they will tell you to choose those far far areas where it is quote inconvenience. The price tag also not cheap..

Go private my friend. Sever ties with HDB. That's the best.
 
Back in 2004, I was so fed-up with HDB that I told myself that even if I had a penny left, I will spend it on a private than HDB. You will be surprised that when driven to the wall (actually HDB drove me to the wall, went to see MP somemore but no use), somehow you will find ways to get a private.
 
Many people think private is too expensive. But with proper financial budgeting and especially if you have a spouse to help out (I am alone), it is not impossible as long your expectations are realistic. Some of the older private units are not that bad, or talk to the bank if they have any foreclosures coming out. Cut back some of your expenses if neccessary and everyone can get out of this HDB stuff.
 
Take action. I have seen complains from high conservancy fees, parking fees, HDB inflexible rules, etc, etc. You guys have a choice. Get out of the vicious cycle and go private.

Guess the point is that, Town council makes money and loses them on Lehmen brothers is ok instead of giving it back by lowing the fees.
 

Lowering the CPF has actually reducing your pay, through the years, you get even less through cuts of CPF.
 

As for the heavily subsidised flat, in my view is doubtful, have a look at the price of the land purchased and the quality of the HDB compared to the private sector.
 

After all said, in my view, again, it is a perceived image that HDB is cheap.

Cannot tahan our own HDB....MBT juz mentions that HDB remained affordable; indicating statistic shows that pricing of HDB is line with household income. 
I somehow sympathise our younger generation. They are forced to buy expensive flats and yet our govt agency is singing bird song and asking them to "buy within their means".

 
 
dude, sometimes, before we blame others, we gotta look at ourselves first.
 
Many people cannot afford 5 room flats or even 4 room flats but they die die want to buy and leverage putting their finances at high risk.  "abusing" the system knowing that receivership does not take HDB flats.  and at the same time, what this does is push prices up.
 
 
Our younger generation is forced to buy expensive flats partly becos the older generation played the market and caused prices to go up.
 
However I do agree that the ceiling of $8k is bullcrap,  it should be raised at least to $12k in today's world.
 
 
At least people can enjoy govt grants and subsidies.
I have never been able to buy a new HDB even though I wanted to and still want to.
Isnt it a right of being a singaporean?
Thats why I say, the middle class are the worst hit.
We earn enough not to take from others and we also earn enough to give to others 
So we only give and never take........ how leh?

assuming after buy 355k... and suay suay after 5yrs, the resale value is only 300k... and then want to sell this to buy another direct flat from HDB... 
in this case selling at a loss (300k), still need to pay resale levy 40k(for 4rm flat) to HDB ?

 
In most cases if resale value drop, the owner will ask for more cash to make up the loss ...

To obtain bank loan for private properties, the interest rate is quite substantial and not easy matters.Furthermore, due to unforeseen circumstances that you default payment, the bank will repossessed the properties. no joking manner... Though there is comprain for HDB miscellaneous matters, majority still go for HDB flat even for those owner switching to private property . They will still keep it just in case.

Read the "Today" newspaper. Mah say it take 300K to build a flat in Sengkang but HDB is selling to the people at 200K only, 100K cheaper already. 
I wonder how the 300K comes from? Where's the figure? Someone got to make Mah release the figure.

 
Mah is senile liao... He dreams of winning toto 300k every nite, hence he figure
 
Example
1 block of flat 18 storey 
1 storey 10 unit
1 block = 17 floor x 10 unit
170 unit @300k =51 million / block
 
Like that..think I better go register a Con truction Con perny liao...

i think it's damn obvious. just that they try to milk the pple while they can. haven't received the strong slap in the face at elections yet.
 
pple really have no choice. unless they are rich enuff to afford condo or can stay with their parents in older, large flats, landed or whatever.. HDB has a monopoly, and they show us who's in control here

How do these buyers pay a flat worth 500k to 600k with a maximum salary of 8k?  
Impliedly, you are making these buyers to continue working until they die.

 
they are also trying to entrap pple into under declaring their income 
 
that's another way to get around it, if u think about it. 
 
the other way (only for self-employed) is to become a cabby for a year, or bum around. but still need certain level of income otherwise they won't give u a HDB loan. also LPPL

Come to think of ur opinion.... u are quite right... the younger generation now has to suffer due to the market being "exploited" by the previous generation.
 
But most of the younger generation do benefit in other forms... parents get cold hard cash to send their kids to universities, wedding expenses covered by parents, etc... 
 
So the younger generation are now left to find their own calling. Hell, no one taught the older gen to play the HDB like they did

as a certain Dr Chee pointed out (the guy dissed by public and PAP alike), CPF is meant for RETIREMENT.
 
if you use your CPF to pay for your flat, you just blew a large amount of your "retirement" savings . sadly, this holds for most of us. i will be in this category too. but then again, my flat is kinda special deal

i'm damn lucky my spouse and i are realistic and practical and think on same wavelength on this issue. book 3 rm flat when we officially have no income. mature estate, under 100k
 
but thinking of upgrading HDB is damn sian looking at the prices. private may be the way to go if we can afford. could also act as an investment (by renting out the unit, not speculating).
 
honestly, smaller flat got many perks (too bad for those who really need the space). s&c is cheaper. so got a bit of saving in the long run. am also happy with my open air carpark cos i save $30 a month liao. balls to my car paintwork

HDB market subsidy, actually in itself i wun complain. but the thing is that it will kinda chase the prices upwards. pple will sell their resale flats higher to try to make more profit, HDB will then jack up their prices to reflect the market sentiment. of course, given the economy, resale prices may fall... even faster than hdb prices

No blaming game. For discussion purpose and killing my time in the forum.
 
Yes, those had their 2nd bite or even 3rd bite of the cherry resulted the current policies imposed. Some of us will really have us to be blamed and I have no doubt about that too.
 
However, let's put in different prospective, if the public housing has be driven to P&L, then public housing should be completely free market; just like HK or US. Then every buyer is responsible for their decision. There are economy cycle where people can pick up good deals. Whether younger generation will buy inexpensive or expensive flat will solely depend on their fiancial intelligence.
 
With less than 8% household late with their payment, the ministry need to speak about helping - lower price 2-rm flat - so noble! The adgenda of providing a roof above the head and profit driven organistion are two different set of management.

The build and design one leh....at boon keng....750k is reasonable for HDB ? for god sake....its after all a HDB....and they selling it like a private apartment !!
 

I wonder how much resale price would be next time....1 million for HDB ?
 

Resale price 300K 400K is depending on location....if its good...then price higher. Since 1st hand owner would have bought it cheaper. My Bt Batok flat when new was 189K (5 room) just a few months back....1 floor above me deal 350K....so tidy profit for the owner....when pple got cash in hand....they tend to be braver to buy more expensive.
 

Arrears HDB not worried...cos they know that when they sell....they can recover the amount....its only when they breach the "you sell also not enuff to pay back" then they start to worry. I wonder why HDB dun give out loan to applicants of their new flats anymore....

Under our current housing policy, to be fair to HDB, those DBSS are premium flat. Someone ever commented that DBSS is a fast-track way to get into public housing aka pay more for shorter waiting queue.
 
Ppl are consistantly finding ways to make $$. Philosophically this is not wrong. HDB only conveniently provide the platform in the past and now they are taking away.

This is quite true.. With such a capped limit i wonder how this buyer is going to  to service the loan, It is totally senseless.. Time for them to wake up 
 
It is quite difficult for them to wake up if they still believe and rely on their own perceived world of their own and wanting to win in all situations and circumstances. It is like continually to drink black cough drop even when your cough is completely healed.

Though there is comprain for HDB miscellaneous matters, majority still go for HDB flat even for those owner switching to private property . They will still keep it just in case.
 
The interest rate have many to choose from. You need to do some homework to think if a variable rate or a fix rate is good for you. I recently just did a refinance on a variable rate, no lock-in period. 
 
If one can afford a HDB and then buy another private, then of course that's the best because the HDB can be rented out.
 
As for the default payment part, buy only within you (and your spouse) means. Normally the payment is via CPF and your CPF OA should be able to make that payment for at least one -two years if you happen to lose your job now. If cash part has to come in, then you are not buying within your means.
 
Choose your interest rate wisely, choose one that is within your means and you should be able to see out your loan.

Impliedly, you are making these buyers to continue working until they die.
 
 
MBT not only clever, he also very far sighted.
 
Youngster who need purchased flat this days was from families that strongly only produce 1 or 2 child. Some of them their parents is either about to or had withdrawed their CPF fat fat saving.So what you guess??
 
By selling at rediculous price, these parents usually will pump in cash to help their kids to buy flats. Now you can see the whole picture??
 
Money flow out from CPF will make U-turn back to their pocket again.

He likes to paint a beautiful picture..... Think he think he is still talking to pple from the 80s?
 
Why should 2-3 rm flat be built in the prime district (300k )? Since they are for family who is downgrading or facing financial difficulties, it should be as cheap as possible...location is NOT their main concern...$$$ is.
 
As in ST today "Our public housing, that are PRICED below market rate, is affordable as avg owner use less than a quarter of their monthly household income for their mortage which is below international benchmark of 30%."
 
 
Based on what statistic ? 
Who conducted and work out the statistic? 
Are we comparing apple to apple ? 
International benchmark is based on our pigeon hole (now becoming more like for sparrow only coz pigeon is fatter  ) vs landed property used in the internataionl benchmark
How much is your salary here and in other country for doing the same thing , Is the international benchmark a FAIR one?
 
Please please talk sense..and back up "the medicine" you are selling...Dun simply grab some statistic that seems and sounds very favourable to you and your point that you are trying to make. Pple will recognise and respect leader who shows empathy to their followers not someone who think that they are a good leader (to their bossess)

 
I have to say 1st, i agree that flats are priced too high.
 
And I was shocked when a new bedok 4rm flar cost 400+k. But i was even more shocked when i realised people are willing to pay for it. Same goes for those 600k+ flats.
 
Why 2-3rm flat built in prime district? Because there are people willing to pay for it thus when you say people care more about $$$ rather than location is wrong.
 
what the ST say is not entirely false, because the flats are really cheaper than market rate, market = resale flats.
 
As long as people are willing to pay, i dun think we can complain. Want to make a stand? Dun buy HDB lor.... Which is why i decided not to buy yet.

affordable cos can use CPF? wad the FARK?  

as a certain Dr Chee pointed out (the guy dissed by public and PAP alike), CPF is meant for RETIREMENT. 
 

if you use your CPF to pay for your flat, you just blew a large amount of your "retirement" savings . sadly, this holds for most of us. i will be in this category too. but then again, my flat is kinda special deal 
 

the only way to retrieve your retirement savings is to sell the house and live on the street, or retire in batam. oh. then no conflict. cos Mr Khaw ask us to retire in Batam. 
 

maybe the education system has failed. cos it failed to make some of us stupid enuff to see thru their shenanigans 

 

one thing hor.. just keeping cpf there will cause the money there to erode away by inflation, and our gahmen is not prepared to give higher interest rate to overcome this. i won't say using it for housing/investments is bad..just have to open eye big big before committing the money 
 

one way, which some of my friends do, is to get themselves an alternative, ie. quit.  

get a pr in another country first, after a few years if they are ok with the foreign lifestyle, withdraw their cpf which then it really become theirs.. 

if not suitable, can always come back..don't return that pink ic yet. 
 

years back, my ex-colleague quitted (not cos of money, but for their autistic child) to australia. liked it so much that they stayed there, got citizenship and withdrew their cpf, used it to buy a 2nd house to collect rent and for income tax rebate. 

now living quite a comfy lifestyle, despite being 2nd class (ie. asian) in angmoh country. 

btw, they told me their house/lands are true freehold, and the gahmen cannot take it away as they suka suka deem fit.. (unlike sg.. just give a lame reason then 'buy' from the owner at 'market' price) 
 

hahaha.. u also remember our mr khaw's comment about retiring batam.. it gives me the impression like, shove the lao-eh, who cannot work and no contribution to economy and all ship to batam to die..

yes i agree. if they want to build 'cheap' 2-3 rm flats, they should not do it in prime districts.. affordability is the main concern for people who downgrade.  

of course, if their intended audience isn't those downgraders, then its justified..

I know its a premium....I think its ready to move in kind with min reno required. But say a normal flat in Boon Keng....300k (sell off HDB price) and then you spend 100k on reno (which I dun think the premium flats got 100K worth of reno)....all in still 400K nia.
 

Remember....there is no facilities to begin with....so the extra for what ?
 

if I gonna pay that much....I rather pay a little more and get a condo instead.

solve the problem... shut down the HDB.. privatise all current HDB.. let all flats be traded on the open market..
 
keep a select few rental flats as government housing.. rest privatise...
 
problem solved.. only in singapore must a government provide housing.. i dont see why market forces cant take care of it in a developed country like singapore..
 
it's by far the best solution.. ppl wont kow peh as if prices rise, it's the fault of the people.. government will also be able to focus on other more important things..
 
current hdb prices are not just gahmen fault.. ppl owe hdb cos they bought expensive flats.. this price is determined by your fellow singaporean seller.. so why blame anyone else but ourselves... and if we didnt allow price fluctuation and COV, ppl wont sell.. and newly weds like me and my wife wouldnt  be able to buy our flat cos nobody would sell!!!

you will see another sub prime in singapore...
 
because alot of singaporean dunno how to think for themselves. they are spending money just like the yanks.
 
using 90% of you CPF to pay for housing for 30 years is just crazy..... 
 
contrubution drop as you age. and what about retirement?
 
even if we manage to avoid sub prime mess, there will be retirement issues in 20-30 years time. social problem again

750k is really way too much for any hdb flats la..    they only treat people like carrots head and chop only..  
 
750k is a crazy price but there are carrots willing to be chopped. So if sh*t happens, this people should not complain that it is unaffordable in the 1st place.
 
There are 5 rm flats going for 200+k but at places like pasir ris.....
 
ya sh!t happens.. now the big sh!t really happened liao.. with the times outside so bad.. how would any of the new buyers take it?

either way we are screwed.
in US, they give loans to those that cannot afford to buy house and have poor credit rating.
in sgp, they put a cap on what income can buy what price hdb and make you pay too much for what you can't afford also.
 
gahmen or private, both screw the citizen for a small roof over the head.

assuming after buy 355k... and suay suay after 5yrs, the resale value is only 300k... and then want to sell this to buy another direct flat from HDB... 
in this case selling at a loss (300k), still need to pay resale levy 40k(for 4rm flat) to HDB ?
if still need to pay resale levy 40k, then loss become 55k + 40k = 95k....
 
so this still call subsidize flat ?  
 
maybe can call suicide flat 

 
tat is why HDB must do "market based pricing" to support HDB prices mah...... Actually, this reminds me of the question, is God & Devil actually the same guy?

As of October 2008, some 33,000 flat owners owed HDB arrears of three months or more. They make up less than 8 per cent of the 420,000 households with outstanding HDB loans.
 
good luck to the 8% as I dun think anyone can help them  ....
 
Last evening news, MP adviced them to downgrade the flat.
 
  , what if already in 3rm or smaller, downgrade to sleep in park, wait kena fined $200

there's no difference.. there they owe the banks.. here they owe the government.. is there a difference?
 
what they need to do is to privatise and then have stringent rules on the provision of loans.. singaporeans are getting too needy for their own good...

to me, the layman, yes there is a difference. You owe banks, 3mths-6mths default they repossessed your flat irregardless of reason. HDB maybe 6mths, 12mths or even longer depending on circumstances.

I will not agree. For 1 very simple reason, what i have now, everything was thru property, go up we sell, go down we countinue to stay. Nothing else.

Maybe, but there is a loan quantum as well as some requirements. This are the steps in place to prevent this. Some may slip thru but i think majority will not.
 
The problem is not the affordability of the flat only, a person goes into debts usually because of a sumation of various things. Usually, car, credit card bills, gambling.

Nah... the real sh*t has not hit us yet... wait till next yr ba..... hopefully i can find a good bargain, as for those new buyers, there are 2 grps, 1 group that is serious in getting a home, these pple will not be affected because theyu have done their sums. the 2nd grp are speculators, they can't blame anyone can they?

pls lar, you want buy 355k flat, is your own decision, no one force you.
 
And if you cant afford the 95k then dun change. Why must allow you to change? especially if you can't afford it? then like that everyone can change flats as often as they change underwear liao...

That's bovine excrement! How to downgrade?
 
I was living in 5 room flat, to downgrade, there are various costs involved with buying resale flat from the open market:
 
1.   Price above valuation of the flat - can be $10k - $15k nowadays
2.   5% of the valuation - banks only loan up to 95% of valuation, the 5% has to be in cold hard cash
3.   Borrow from banks - HDB don't loan to downgraders anymore, and no more preferntial interest rate of 2.6%, bank rates is around 3+%
 
If I buy a new flat from HDB, then I would be subjected to resale levy of $45K, because my 5 room flat was bought new from HDB.

consider the fact that u NEED NOT downgrade (i assume la, and that is a good thing!). but for those who MUST downgrade, they have to go thru the conditions u stated. that's something new to me 
 
i'm glad i start small. can stay put or upgrade. if wanna downgrade is really impossible.

...the gahmen acquire (actually is almost as good as robbing) part of their garden to expand the road. 
wanna guess how much they were paid for the land? 
$1? My relative kenna years ago. Not only part of the land were taken away from them for $1...their property value also dropped by a lot.

I agree. That is the stupid thing about the 8K salary cap. Y can't they just lift the salary cap based on each 100K? Eg... flats <=400K, 8K cap. >400, 9K cap. >500, 10K cap. 
In this way, they would make it fair for all.
