each person got two chances to buy NEW HDB flat.

Must think far far ahead and use the two chance "wisely" to maximise your profit. 
 

Dont be so gian peng to get the 2-roomer. When come to re-sale for 2-roomer, you will have a hard time to sell.

Is basically saying, if you still single by 35, then just concede defeat and admit you gonna be single the rest of your life.
 

Why don't they make it easier for younger singles to buy flats? Like I mentioned before, if you already have a secure roof over your head, easier to go out and find partner and don't need worry so much about settling down.
 

It doesn't have to be new flats even. Govt can give one off grants to young first timers to buy resale.

Dont know singles now should happy or not happy, since they only allowed to buy 2 room flat. And there are 2 sizes, 35sqm and 45 sqm. When i look at the 45sqm floor plan, i already find the flat quite small le, wonder how about the 35sqm?! Wonder where they will build these 2 room flat for singles?
 

2 room actually quite cosy and easy to maintain for single, esp those who doesnt earn high pay. Only one thing no good is, you have no space for friends to come over at your house for overnight stay.

Agreed, if resale market dont have cov or the cov is only $2-3K, maybe singles still can afford to buy resale flat. I find not easy for one person to buy resale flat, unless you are very cash rich or earn very high salary. 
 

Actually 2 room flat consider not bad la, at least it is a brand new flat and not like those over 10-20 years or more 3 room.

Then singles very sway since govt always 'target' them. Altough now they allow them to buy BTO, but they 'cut off' their extra income by only allow to buy 2 room BTO, since there is no extra room to rent out. Unless they allow them to rent out the whole unit?

Welp there goes my hope. I was waiting for the "BTO for Singles" announcement but don't qualify because of salary. I was hoping they'd limit it to 3-room flats instead and keep the current income requirements.

Not sure why, but when i read most of the post so far on this matter, it seems that most pple are not getting the story right.
 

This new policy from HDB is meant to help singles who have financial difficulties to get a flat. Meaning it is for single who earn less than $5k a month. Yes, its 2-rm, it's mickey mouse, but it should be sufficient considering the financial constraints that they have.
 

However, it does not mean singles cannot buy 4-5rm flats for rental income or whatever. If the single is cash rich, doesn't matter whether he/she earns  less or more than 5k a month, he/she can always buy a resale 4-5rm  flat. No one says single must stuck with a mickey mouse flat.
 

Meaning the new policy is an available option. It is not a restriction.
 

Hopefully this is clear . And I think the new policy is fair, otherwise pple will say singles will compete with families for new 4-rm or 5-rm making needy families harder to get a flat fast. Or why bother to get married when singles already can buy a new 4-rm or 5-rm.

haha ...i dont think the single did not understand the policy

it's just they also want to buy 4/5 room HDB to rent out room and resell because everyone talk about how much they made  when their HDB sold at $800k-$1,000,000 bought at $400k-$500k
 

seriously, when a couple or single ... they are just buyer. future profit at resell definitely is in their mind when they buy their 1st flat. HDB is a money making machine is in everyone mind.
 

now then minister says want to revisit the purpose and objective of HDB ... but for the longest time HDB is a money making machine.

I don't really agree with that policy. To me house is house. Main purpose is to stay.
 

If you expect your house to generate you double profits in quick time, then I think something's been fundamentally wrong with this country. In the end resale market becomes out of bounds to all but the richest people.

Agree.

HDB is for public housing.

Public housing is meant to satisfy the basic needs of the citizens, especially the not-so-well-to-do.
 

If people want to make money, please do it on private housing and condominiums.

i think the main concern here is that the floor plan for 2 room is most likely same as the studio unit...
 

studio unit is to sell to older citizen for occupancy of only 30 Years...that already price @ abt 100~160K...
 

so what can we expect the price for this 2 room unit for single??

will they also limit 2-room to 30 Year... expect by then they will more to another studio unit and be milked again??

It's not easy to administer that, as singles are put through balloting system to acquire such units; in direct competition with lower income families. 
 

Unless, its like what some said here about Single Village thingy; whereby the whole estate is built to accomodate singles only.
 

Well, if they decide to put singles in unfair housing allotment as such, then they are drawing more wrath from the singles; as we all know that they have always advocated that subsidized HDB is meant for famili nuclei only.....

Seems like having more opposition in parliment is working. Of course, the recent anti govt sentiment on the ground also put a strong point to PAP.......YOU are our SERVANT! Not the other way!



 

Agree in general, but if change the word "Give" to "sell" will be more approriate right?

Not everyone is looking at getting a place to flip it for profit down the road. I personally just want an affordable 3-room that i can pay of in a reasonable amount of time and then not have to worry about a mortgage anymore.
 

I don't quite understand the 5k income cap on the singles BTO scheme, since it's by balloting and not bidding so it's not like someone earning over 5k is going to beat out someone earning below 5k just because he/she has deeper pockets (unless this cap will also apply to the resale market in the future). A married couple with only one person working doesn't get capped.

The 5k income cap is BS to me too. Well, the main reason is that they are not willing to build sufficient supply for the Singles group, hence, they have to put in some clauses to curb demand rather than to improve on supply. Of course they will tell us that " We are still encouraging singles to get married and that's why we resort to this measure". Craps

I think reason being lots of singles around.
 

Those have more monies can buy resale.
 

This to protect poorer singles.
 

Actually i support encouraging marrying even u are in the fourties.

There are still lot of resale 3 room flats in Singapore asking for <$300K.

Of cos the locations of these <300k resale 3 rooms flats is not very ideal. 
 

I don't know whether is this consider affordable or not. 
 

Unless you are expecting to get a new HDB 3 room <200k and 

without the 5k income cap, then maybe you are asking for too much. 
 

There are still many Singles Singaporeans out there whose salary is <$5000 when 

they are age 35 yrs and older. 
 

Although I still don't agree with many of our garment policies,

I think the singles BTO scheme targetting this group of pple

is in the right direction from our garment.

A quick  question:
 

What happen if a guy is 35 years old but he is earning $6k?

If he quits his job and intentionally downgrade his earning to $4.9k (for a short period) to apply, would he be successful?

Kbw got say he s gonna sell bto at 30% cheaper

I suspect he is going to launch a special type of bto, cheap one but major restriction: cannot sell open mkt, cannot rent out, strictly self stay, then sell, can only sell back to govt at purchase price
 

In this way, he will satisfy those who want to self stay one, no make profits type

Question is who will buy? Is there real demand for this?

I think maybe he run a few batches, so got takers or not, if no much demand, scrap lor
 

But I suspect, the mainstream bto will still be available

When I was a small kid during the 70s, I used to stay in the 1-room and 2-room flats in the redhill area.
 

My impression was, the housing was poorly ventilated with neighbors residing on opposite side of the common corridor.  The smell of urine and faeces would sometimes fill the stagnant air.  
 

The room could get stuffy at times.  My experience staying in such building was not so pleasant.  I hope they have a much improved version in the newly-built ones.

It's not easy to administer that, as singles are put through balloting system to acquire such units; in direct competition with lower income families. 
 

Unless, its like what some said here about Single Village thingy; whereby the whole estate is built to accomodate singles only.
 

Well, if they decide to put singles in unfair housing allotment as such, then they are drawing more wrath from the singles; as we all know that they have always advocated that subsidized HDB is meant for famili nuclei only.....



 

Singles village is a good idea

It is like last time ntu nus hall

Got orientation camp, got block supper, got all kind of activities

Soon sure got couple hit on, becum preggy, git baby, then upgrade to 5 room lor

If a person buys the 2-room flat (meant for single) when he is 35 and then subsequently gets married when he is 37, does he need to sell away the flat?
 

Assuming the above newly-married couples are not so well to do, can they have the option to remain in their (2) respective flats?

without the 5k income cap, then maybe you are asking for too much.



 

From my browsing of property ads online, there aren't that many 3-room flats on the resale market available for under 300k and usually the "under 300k" is valuation price only. From a conversation with a property agent (who is also a family friend) most sellers are asking at least 20-30k COV for 3-room flats. Personally i feel that 200-250k is a more ideal price range, but we all know our property market has gone bananas in the last 4 years.
 

Of course if there are any recommendations for listings i'd be more than willing to check them out. Remote and quiet locations would be preferable. I was planning on serious shopping in the next few months but have decided to hold off until later in the year. From the developments in the past few weeks it seems that there are some changes in government planning and policies, so i think it'd be better to sit on the fence for a little while longer.

In NTU, the rooms are co-shared. Want to stay in Single room must clock more ECA points. And if caught hanky panky in the room....room get confiscated.
 

So this is not a path KBW can consider.

An article in yesterday newspaper says that the reason why they cap at $5000 for singles to apply for the 2 room BTO flat, because about 80% of the singles who are eligible to buy the BTO flat earns $5000 and below. So it means almost every singles here are eligible to buy the BTO flat.

To me, I think the 5K is a crowd control mechanism.... The availability is still very limited.... So what happen, when 1000 fella wants to vie for 200 units? gahmen starts profiling who's more eligible....

New estate in West will be Tengah Estate, it is still a forest at the moment. Probably we can see some construction work carrry out by 2014. Heard that the estate is as big as AMK estate.  From PIE (KJE) - Bukit Batok Road - Brickland

Also heard that there is possbility (but not very high) that they may extend the estate to Sungei Tengah, the area where have many fish farms and vegi farms. I hope they keep the area, please don't make further damage to our nature by building flats and sell to those FT, PRs and NC. 
 

HDB should include 2-room BTO in this area and I will be the first to chiong for it. Compare to Punggol and Sengkang, this non-mature estate is really a godforsaken place. Wonder how many interested to stay there?

You interested to stay in Tengah, Sungei Tengah area?  Even they have plans to build the 2 room BTO flat for singles there, by the time the flat ready the person should be 50 year old liao!  Also if you compare Sungei Tengah area with sengkang, surely sengkang score better, in terms of amenity and the surrounding area. Although they still group sengkang as non mature estate.

I believe they would not build only 2 room flat in one area/sector. Most probably they should build the block mixture of 2 and 3 room flat.

the reason very simple mah.. HDB launch by batches. next launch only Seng kang have 2 room. so if want other area might want to wait.
 
 

BTW, i notice, HDB no longer post their planned launch liao. last time we can see 2 to 3 launch ahead of where the location they want to launch. now cannot see liao.

Agreed, they should launch in sengkang first, then see how is the demand, then later launch in other areas. But since they can only build in non mature area, you tell me how many current estate is group under non mature?

Two-room flat for $10,000
Tessa Wong MyPaper Thursday, Mar 27, 2014
 
SINGAPORE - Up for grabs: A two-room flat in Sembawang that costs just $10,000, with housing grants.
 
With the Housing Board's latest Build-To-Order flat launch, experts say this has set the lowest price for a flat in recent memory.
 
The HDB yesterday launched 3,497 new flats in the non-mature towns of Sembawang, Sengkang and Yishun.
 
The price of two-room flats at the EastLace@Canberra and EastCrown@Canberra projects starts from $10,000 with housing grants, and $70,000 without grants.
 
Only one flat boasts of this price, but others can be had for a few hundred dollars more.
 
The HDB said yesterday that that one flat is the lowest priced two-roomer offered since 2011, when the Special CPF Housing Grant (SHG) of $20,000 was introduced.
 
Experts told MyPaper that this is one of the lowest prices set for a BTO flat in many years.
 
"It is really unprecedented," said PropNex chief executive Mohamed Ismail Gafoor.
 
The HDB appears to have been offering smaller flats at lower prices in recent years. In the previous BTO launch in January, a two-room flat in Woodlands Glen was going for $13,000 with grants and $73,000 without grants.
 
The two-room EastLace and EastCrown flats are not the cheapest in terms of overall price - in June 2010, a two-room flat at Rivervale Arc went for $68,000. But overall housing grants were also lower at that time, as the SHG did not exist then.
 
First-timer households can now enjoy up to $60,000 in housing grants, comprising of the SHG and the Additional CPF Housing Grant of $40,000.
 
ERA's key executive officer, Mr Eugene Lim, pointed out that one reason for the low price of these flats is their smaller size.
 
In terms of internal floor area, the flats come in two sizes - 36 sq m and 45 sq m. Two-room flats are usually bigger than 40 sq m, said Mr Lim.
 
Nevertheless, the overall price is lower and this shows the Government is "trying to keep the quantum affordable, especially for low-income families," he said.
 
Several noted that the downward trend for small-flat prices comes as construction and labour costs have gone up in recent years.
 
"The smaller the flat is, the greater the subsidy the Government seems to give in the pricing," said Mr Ismail, who added that the delinking of new flat pricing from resale flat prices in 2011 has also played a part.
 
All this is part of the recent push by the Government to provide more for the poor.
 
"It's all part of the increased social welfare that the Government is giving to Singaporeans, even though welfare remains a dirty word," said SLP International research head Nicholas Mak.
