Buy flat just to get married? Then the marriage is for all the wrong reasons... And all other countries with lower housing prices and no such age limits gone case also becos they all won't get married goin by your logic.

lBillionaire Bhupendra Kumar Modi (pictured) has urged Singapore's government to lower its 35-year-old ruling for singles to buy HDB flats, highlighting that it affects the country's birth rate, Bloomberg reported.
 

Modi, who became a Singapore citizen in 2012, said lowering the age requirement to 25-years-old will encourage singles to pursue relationships and marry earlier, which in turn will boost the population and workforce.
 

The Chairman of Spice Group plans to put forth this suggestion to the government through his Global Citizens Forum, which he set up this year to support youths around the world.
 

"Most of the girls and boys these days would like to have sex before they marry," he said. "There are no virgin marriages."




How would it help to boost more marriage? I don't understand his logic...

Why now 35 than can buy flat as single. 

If everyone can classified as single at 25 than why those still want marriage since they already got a flat at 25. 

35 is becos u are considered not so attractive liao and so u are eligible to buy flat as single. 

How many % of us singaporean actually get married after 35?

For many of my friends, getting a HDB was a big factor when considering marriage. I asked a few of my friends why get married so early, they told me if wait any longer, the price of HDB will keep going up.

You see ahh, what I feel is, wouldn't it be considered an asset if a guy already has his own flat? Like, you know ... the guy is already matured and ready enough to wanna settle down, hence went to get his own flat instead of still living with parents, or spending his money on other "foolish" hobbies? (Talking about the average Singaporean guy only la ofc, not someone atas who can buy condo etc etc).
 

On paper, I feel like someone who already has his own property would have higher chances of scoring a chick (preferably a chick who intends to settle down la), compared to one who doesn't.

Agree, while marriage shouldn't be about getting a flat, the current policy certainly does steer alot of young couples in that direction, as another mcfer has just pointed out.

Yup, in a way your theory is also correct, if the guy has intentions to settle down later, by using his single flat to his advantage...

Look, in many countries people move out of their parents house at 18-20. That's when they truly become an adult, and are forced to grow up and be independent in order to support their adult lifestyle. This includes maintaining house and etc.
 

I know Singapore land scarce and not possible for everyone to get their own personal place, but at least give us the options.
 

If singles are allowed easier access to buying house:
 

- Young people won't be so spoiled, everything go back to mum and dad. You keep your own house, clean dirty pay bills all your own responsibility.

- And yes, it definitely makes things easier for developing relationships. Like it or not Singaporean girls very practical one. Let's not even talk about sex and privacy. Being able to maintain your own place shows what kind of person you are, whether you are sloppy or responsible. More importantly, it is definitely an incentive to settle down and start a family, and not have to think about where and when to get your own flat (because you already have one). People can just freely go out and get married without so much worries.

I think people getting married to buy flats are doing it for all the wrong reasons.

People should get married for the right reasons like having kids.
 

I got married to have kids. I got married when the condom broke.

Anyway just bcos we like to pretend people dun have sex before mariage

doesn't mean they are not! I myself had sex before marriage and that why

I was late going to the ROM. 
 

It was very embarassing with the future in laws waiting there.

Anyway if we allows 25 year olds to have their own place, they will be going at it like

rabbits and one day when the condom breaks, they will end up getting married and the

gov will be very happy.

exactly...
 

people need to learn the art of thinking with the big head more than thinking with the small head
 

this will give rise to a happier society with less hurt souls among us
 
 

singaporeans have been happy and successful due to our strong values.... however it is fading away due to the influence of western, indian, chinese culture etc
 

now he will say that it is ok to have premarital sex.... but can you guys see what will happen in the long run? just look at thailand
 

having sex is a norm there. look at the divorce rate. look at the number of broken families. look at the abortion rate.
 
 

at the rate we are going i can assure singaporeans one thing..... it is going to be a sad and hurtful society simply due to the lack of responsibility
 

look around you... look at all the depressed people around you
 

good luck sillyporeans
 
 

i will continue to take care of my wonderful gf and keep the trust of my in laws.... i love the overflowing trust the whole family has on one another....i have no reason to break this trust we all share due to little perks....  i love the fact that both our parents brought us up very well.... we will definitely take care of our parents till the end.... we will teach our children good values.... we love animals... and it goes on and on
 

don't want to brag but LIFE can really be SUPER AWESOME when you think with your big head
 

and the trust your loved ones have in you is priceless  
 

this is why people like the prataman, even with his billions, will never attain this high level of happiness....

i think pre marital sex has nothing to do with the original concept of HDB ownership.
 

HDB was originally created so that people will own their own homes and feel ownership and pride over their small pigeon hole. It will reduce slums and poorly maintained estates (government rental units which u can see in HK/malaysia).

And also to promote a family unit of at least 2 adults, that is why HDB was created and still have the anti-singles <35 policy.
 

Honestly, even with all the downsides of reducing fertility among young couples and dragging out the getting married process. I still think the current policy makes sense. Singles should still be allowed to buy only later than couples.

actually the only issue with the old system is supply. If you have a semi completed BTO with units available, then those getting married can buy these flats with a slower lag time.
 

Solving the problem is not say just say solve problem A and don't anticipate problem B. All solutions create another problem.

16 applications from singles for every two-room flat on offer
Published on Jul 31, 2013	

By Daryl Chin
 

Barely a day after the latest Build-To-Order (BTO) launch and there were already about 16 applications from singles for every two-room flat on offer.
 

The latest figures, posted on the Housing Board's website at 2pm on Wednesday, showed that the 231 units in Sengkang were more popular than the units on offer in Yishun.
 

A total of 519 two-room flats were launched with up to a third being set aside specifically for singles. This is the first time singles are able to bid for brand new public flats. Previously they were restricted to the resale market.
 

Analysts said the latest figures reflected the attractiveness of the latest offering in terms of pricing and grants given. PropNex chief executive Mr Mohamed Ismail said: "It seems clear from the latest launch that the Government is recognising that singles are important contributors to society." The exercise closes on Aug 5.

Depends how old is the single lo, usually if the person is working as manager level, should earn $5k or even more. And also those working shift, gross per month might also close to that amount.
 

But looks like the response from the single is quite good? Although 2 room flat consider not a popular flat in every BTO, as you can still find many left-over 2 room flat from previous BTO.

I believe many people are doing that, nobody will know lo. So how would HDB knows? Unless someone reported to HDB. I know some people rent the whole unit and then sub-let the room to others.

Civil servant Fiona Tan, a 42-year-old single currently living in a rental flat in Queenstown, is interested in the latest launch of two-room Housing Board flats, as the new grants that are being offered make them attractive. -- ST PHOTO: JOYCE FANG
 


LOW-INCOME singles looking for their first new Housing Board flat will now be able to get up to $30,000 in extra subsidy if they apply on their own. 

The grants double to $60,000 if two or more singles apply together, pushing a two-room flat's price to as low as $16,000.
 

This was one of the tweaks HDB announced yesterday during a milestone launch of 4,079 Build-To-Order flats in Sengkang, Yishun and Bukit Merah.
 

Previously, singles could buy only resale flats.
 

But with this launch, first- timer singles aged 35 and up, with a monthly income of $5,000 or less can, for the first time, apply for a new two-room flat in non-mature estates.
 

HDB may relax its policy even further. National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan told The Straits Times that offering two-roomers was just "a start", and bigger flats may be available to singles in the future.
 

For now, up to a third of the 519 two-roomers which have been made available in Sengkang and Yishun will be reserved for singles. Coming in 35 sq m and 45 sq m sizes, they are priced between $76,000 and $133,000.
 

Singles who apply on their own, however, will have to pay an extra $15,000 on top of the selling price, but the money will be returned as a $15,000 grant if they get married later.
 

To ensure low-income families are not squeezed out of these new two-roomers, their qualifying income ceiling has been raised from $2,000 to $5,000.
 

But the biggest tweak announced yesterday was HDB extending two grant schemes to singles in order to help them own their first home.
 

Singles who earn up to $2,500 and apply on their own can get an Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) of up to $20,000. Those who take home $1,125 a month or less get a Special CPF Housing Grant of $10,000.
 

The numbers are doubled for those applying under the Joint Singles Scheme, which means a new two-roomer in Yishun can be bought for as low as $16,000.
 

In comparison, the price tag of a four-room unit in a mature estate such as Bukit Merah starts from $430,000 with grants.
 

Low-income singles can also avail themselves of the AHG when they buy five-room or smaller resale flats.
 

Another change which kicked in was to keep first-timers who marry someone who had bought a flat in the past, for instance a divorcee, in the priority queue.
 

Previously, these couples would have been considered second-timers, and have a tougher time getting a new unit. Now they will be treated as first-timers, for whom the bulk of new flats are reserved.
 

The effect of all these changes, said ERA Realty's key executive officer Eugene Lim, could see more turn away from the resale market. "Singles and second-timers will find it easier to apply for new flats. Coupled with cooling measures earlier and a ramp-up of new flat supply, this could lead to less demand on the resale market."

Agreed. But those who earned between $2500 to $5000, at least now can buy a brand new flat at much lower price as comapred to resale flat. Even dont have grants, the price still much more cheaper than resale flat.

The court heard that Looi had on 2 April 2005 made a false entry when he filed his income tax returns. He stated that he had earned a net profit of S$6,080, when the actual amount was S$199,960.
 

Looi under—declared again in 2006. This time, he stated that net profit earned was S$18,204, when the amount was in fact S$236,140.
 

As a result, the amount of tax evaded in both instances came up to S$65,396.
 



 

Woah, sell curry puff also got 200k profit a year. Not bad leh..

Why now 35 than can buy flat as single. 

If everyone can classified as single at 25 than why those still want marriage since they already got a flat at 25. 

35 is becos u are considered not so attractive liao and so u are eligible to buy flat as single. 

How many % of us singaporean actually get married after 35?



 

About the attractiveness: Actually men become more valuable and attractive as they age. Think women the opposite e.g. machiam depreciating asset. Dun   me pls.

Manager as the name implies typically is a head of department managing a team but Nowadays got a lot of managers who are individual contributors.  So  dont know who the heck he's managing. 
 

Pay scale varies quite a bit across industries but typical mnc manager easily 6-10k

If both singles are staying at ajoining units and if they happen to hit it off and get married, can the adjoining units be combined into one? (2 x 2room = 1 x 4rm hdb?)

About the attractiveness: Actually men become more valuable and attractive as they age. Think women the opposite e.g. machiam depreciating asset. Dun   me pls.



 

This I agree, but also must see whether the Man's financial status got up or not. If never up, also not so valuable. 
 




Manager as the name implies typically is a head of department managing a team but Nowadays got a lot of managers who are individual contributors.  So  dont know who the heck he's managing. 
 

Pay scale varies quite a bit across industries but typical mnc manager easily 6-10k



 

 Some managers manage computer systems only leh. Considered manager? IDK.. Hahaha.. 
 

Give me a cleaner rank, but C-suite pay, instead of a nice title and crappy pay..

How to up status instantly:

Work as a petrol kiosk pump attendant say you work in Oil and Gas

Work as a taxi driver say you work as Private Transportation Specialist 

any others?

wow......... 27 times oversubscribed as of yesterday!! probably jump to 50 times by closing date.
 

the interview show on tv raise a concern about more single not getting married and chose to live together. Example bf/gf both apply for the 2-room flat, they live in one unit and let the other unit vacant (if they dun want to risk been confiscated) and wait for value to appreciate.

Dont think 2 room flat the value can appreciate much la. 2 room flat is not really popular in the resale market due to the small size.
 

What you mean 27 times oversubscribed as of yesterday? You mean the total number of single people submitted for the application?

Agreed, usually when you are given a manager title, you will be also given allowances like car and hp.  Maybe your title is only assistant manager. I have one vendor, last time her title is senior executive but recently changed to assistant manager, and i noticed that she behave and talk differently now.

I think $16K maybe refer to the smaller 2 room flat, 35sqm not the 45sqm. Also could be refer to flat located on the 2nd to 3rd storey only. If you want to get high floor, dont think the price is $16K even after all the grants.

I think some prob just hoot cos its cheap-ish and they eligible to buy. I would too if i could. but i too young. 10 more years to go.
 

I would take down the bedroom / living room wall and put up a louvered partition.
 

The neighborhood might be shady tho considering the demography of residents.

Confirmed sufficient and confy for one person to stay. That's why last time 2 room flat not popular cause they dont allow single to buy lo. I guess now 2 room flat should be high demand.

the actual price is around $100,000 to $120,000 if you make $4,999 per month.  
 

i dun think a lot can qualified for the $16K lah, stop using $16K like it is really that cheap

The neighborhood might be shady tho considering the demography of residents.

the actual price is around $100,000 to $120,000 if you make $4,999 per month.  
 

i dun think a lot can qualified for the $16K lah, stop using $16K like it is really that cheap  




But still cheaper than resale flat.  One resale flat cheapest still need to pay at least $300,000!

I think the pay for the McD manager should have at least $3K or more?



 

Don't know leh, never work there before.. Only got friends worked as front line staff.. $5/hr or something. 
 




sorry u male/shemale?  if latter, porker looking  [laugh]



 

Boss, I 8=====D one leh. Serve NS properly, got gf. Definitely not the latter la.. But if you hiring servant, I Q 1 ok! Haha 
 




This type is like co-habitation. Won't last long one...some years later they get bored of each other will just spilt, cos there is no legal bonding and obligation between them.



 

You make it sound bad. If a married couple (no kids), get bored of each other, lost love, should they also endure for the rest of their life? Doesn't seem right to me leh.

It's all well and good, but i don't think it is wise for people to expect to cash out on these 2-room units in the future after MOP. 
 

The demand for 2-room units on the open market is not very high as it is, and getting financing (if you don't qualify for hdb loan) is not easy. From my recent experience, local banks currently do not give loans for 2-room hdb units (only 3-room and up) and after much searching i managed to find out that hong leong finance was still offering loans and applied to them. 
 

Apparently the other interested buyers for the same unit also had difficulties getting financing and some were in the process of appealing to hdb for financing when i managed to secure my loan.

Actually 2 room flat all along not that difficult to get even need ballot. I think only starts from this 2 room BTO flat then become so popular due to singles now also can buy. 
 

But i feel that since it is the first BTO flat which singles allowed to buy, think most singles no matter whether they need the flat or not, all will just apply for fun and try their luck. This could be the reason of having slim chance of getting and deprive those singles who genuinely really need the flat, and not apply for the sake of applying.

I guess this is the main reason why the 2 room BTO flat so difficult to get, cause many singles get the flat for fun. And they are not in real need for the flat.

Lol, right to buy a flat or need to buy a flat is different.   I believe many single may not have the need to buy a flat since most are staying with parents. But i guess many people esp the singles between 35 to around 40 plus maybe the group of people who prefer to stay alone and want to have a flat of their own?!    As initially the purpose of 2 room flat is to help those low income familes/people to able to buy a flat. But some people might think singles who is earning between $3k to $5k is not consider low income people?!

To get HDB loan for resale flat as a single, there is an income cap of 5k. Anything above that and you have to take bank loan, the problem is finding a bank willing to loan for 2-room HDB flats.
 

So not so easy for singles to buy resale 2-room units and I believe couples would rather go for 3-room flats at least. Also the lower income singles would have issues getting resale flats due to the required cash outlay involved.

In this case, no wonder many singles would opt for the BTO 2 room flat, since the income cap is 5k which singles are eligible to get HDB loan.

I also dun know why HDB allow BTO for single flats. BTO should be for families. There should be enough resale flats for singles to buy in the open markets. I am also worried this would further encourage them to stay single (especially those < 40yo) and never bother to find a mate!  
 

Perhaps its due to the govt trying to pleased the singles population before the next GE ?!?!

I think enough flats to go around for 2 room flat la, just look at the left-over from the previous BTO for 2 room flat you know not many people buy. More likely not enough for 3 room and 4 room to go around.
 

If new citizens need to serve NS before they can apply BTO, then the new citizens will protest that you are discriminating them?! And if they are able to get citizens, they should be allowed to get the same rights and benefits as the rest?!

Cause all along the singles are "protesting" that govt treat them differently and like 3rd class citizen. So maybe govt scare they will lose votes from these group of people, that's why now they allow singles to buy BTO but 2 room only. At least it show that the govt is listening and doing something.

I think they are now trying to build more BTO flats, regardless which type of flat. But think they only allocated certain percentage for singles on the BTO flats. So in the end still depends on your luck and not all singles will benefit from this new ruling.

there are many singles in blue collar jobs.

The govt needs to protect them.
 

How can someone earning 1-2k and single afford a flat then in current prices. I think the 2 room policy is important for social stability as well looking after the less socially mobile.

I believe this is the pupose of building 2 room flat in the first place. Allow those low income single like those who are earning $1.5k below to able to own a flat. But the new ruling now allow single who is earning up to $5k also can buy a new flat, dont know will it affect the chance of those low income group of people getting the flat?

honestly for that group of people, chances of them getting married is slim. If their parents has no house (some staying in rented flat), then it would be an upcoming social problem.

personally i don't see anything wrong with allowing singles to purchase 2rm flats..thats called being an inclusive society..most sinkies eschew buying 2rm flats anyway..thats why the HDB seldom build 2rm flats but instead build more studio apartments(same size as 2rm flats but lease is 30years instead of 99)..those singles who remained singles mostly decided not to get married anyway..especially those who are in theirs 40s-50s..u'll be surprised many are actually applying for this BTO

Not only 40s-50s are applying for this BTO, any singles who is 35 and above who earn $5k below will try their luck on this BTO. Anyway, just need to pay $10 to strike.

I just felt that BTO should be built for those who are married and have families. By giving some BTO to the singles, then those who have families, or going to establish a family soon, will have a even longer queue to get their keys.

Like this, then can also say what real need does a couple have to live away from parents? If single can live with parents, couple can also live with either parents, best thing is that the parents can be baby sitters when the couple goes to work. Sometimes, people just need space away from others, no matter how much you care about them or love them. Singles are no different mah.

71 applications from singles for each Sengkang two-room flat
Published on Aug 05, 2013	
 

By Charissa Yong
 

Demand from singles for Sengkang flats continued strong on Monday - the last day for applications for the Build-To-Order application exercise.
 

There are 71.3 singles applying for each Sengkang flat on offer, according to the latest Housing Board (HDB) figures on Monday morning. HDB also received nearly 34 applications for every two-room flat in Yishun.
 

This is the first time singles aged 35 and over can apply for new HDB flats. Up to 30 per cent of the 519 two-room units on offer in Sengkang and Yishun are reserved for them.
 

Overall figures show 50 applications from singles for every two-room flat. The exercise, which started on July 30, closes at midnight on Monday.

precisely, since couple also have no reason to live away from their parents, why is single given that need?? 
 

okay enough of mudslinging, there is a reason why they called it setting up a new family. if the couple is does not have a place of their own, how can you call that setting up a new family.
 

plus for your info, a lot of parents now a day are not willing to look after the children for you anymore. so dont think parents will definitely look after. a lot of ppl had their relationship with their parents turn sour because of this.

so many single above 35!!
 

71 applications from singles for each Sengkang two-room flat

Published on Aug 05, 2013	
 

By Charissa Yong
 

Demand from singles for Sengkang flats continued strong on Monday - the last day for applications for the Build-To-Order application exercise.
 

There are 71.3 singles applying for each Sengkang flat on offer, according to the latest Housing Board (HDB) figures on Monday morning. HDB also received nearly 34 applications for every two-room flat in Yishun.
 

This is the first time singles aged 35 and over can apply for new HDB flats. Up to 30 per cent of the 519 two-room units on offer in Sengkang and Yishun are reserved for them.
 

Overall figures show 50 applications from singles for every two-room flat. The exercise, which started on July 30, closes at midnight on Monday.




Meaning total application received is 71 or every unit there are 71 person competing? 30 per cent of the 519 two-room units on offer in Sengkang and Yishun are reserved for them, so total unit for each location only have about 78 unit of 2 room flat given to singles?   If yes, then the number quite little lo.
 

I am also quite surprise there are so many singles above 35 all interested and waiting to buy BTO flat? Even the flat is a small 2 room flat? Looks like those who applied for this BTO is like buying TOTO!

Watched the yesterday news, total application for the singles 2 room flat received is over 8000 for the 2 locations!   Imagine the total amount that HDB profit from the singles application alone, each application pay $10!   Thinking where all these application money they earned goes to?

why not? The grant given were quite generous, and buy one for rental income is not a bad idea.
 

Many of these guys could be still living with their parents, so use their 2 room for rental income.
 

If I am single above 35, I would queue for one too. It's no brainer.

i assume you are saying after 8 years ie: 3 years to build + 5 years MOP

8 years from now, the hdb supply could be abundant in the market and rental is not that rosy but still a good passive income 
 

the so called sibei generous $60k subsidy is really targeted to low incomer. those eligible has nothing to shout about ... above 35, single, and earning low (below $2k) 

at least a good helping hand to help them to get their own flat instead of renting or staying with parent

Funny thing is, authorities curb private developers from building too many shoeboxes apartment despite the red hot demand. Say too many shoeboxes  not healthy, blah, blah, blah.
 

Then the authorities themselves start introducing their own shoeboxes via 2 room flats.
 

Sometimes I dunno who to believe.

I am sure some couples would have already think of that. If both are above 35 now, they will surely go get one each and after that, get married next day.
 

It's great to be single!

No wonder can received over 8000 application?! Cause if everyone think like that, the number of people apply will be double and triple!  Even the person doesnt really need the 2 room flat.

But i believe there are many singles who earned above $2k or even close to $5k also submit the application for this 2 room BTO. So it will lesser the chance of those really low earners and need a flat! Cause the lesser the people apply, the more chance you will get. Imagine now the total application is over 8000, how to compete? Unless your luck is damn good.

Ever since they bring back the 2 room flat, this flat is never popular in every BTO and there are many left-over. But i think after this round of BTO, guess there should not have any flats left! But looking at this singles BTO, really worry how govt going to cope with the target of 6.9 million people here?! They still want to increase the population here?! Even the flats now is not enough for their own people, wonder how to give to foreigners/PRs/new citizens?!

We must remember Parents are not our slave and they dont own us anything.



 

Coz people need their own space mah. Whether single or couple (married). Anyway, not to be racist, but from my own observations (no statistics or whatever), a lot of Malay families stay together in one big extended family, so would you call that not setting up a family? 
 

I do agree that parents don't owe their kids anything, other than the initial obligation of raising them. It's just an if / then answer.

problem is..how do you check and enforce?
 

Again, if 2 singles who owns this flat got married, you can't possibly force them to stay apart right?
 

Also if a single got married later, his spouse can't stay with him/her because the flat is meant for only 1?

when many see $16k like sibei cheap ... die die must buy 

but to get the $60K grant ... you have nothing to shout about for earning < $2k
 




But i believe there are many singles who earned above $2k or even close to $5k also submit the application for this 2 room BTO.

I think the $16,000 is only one of the reason, other reasons contributing also have like the overall price even dont have much grants still cheaper than a resale 3 room flat, buy BTO no need to pay COV and many people still prefer a brand new flat than used flat, and this is the very first time HDB allowed singles to buy BTO flat. Which is why it attracted so many people to apply.

Why do studio units for seniors cost so much more than BTO flats for singles? 

Forum
 

SINGAPORE - There has been high demand for the newly launched Build-To-Order two-room Housing Board flats for singles.
 

Buyers are entitled to various housing grants, which can lower the price of such flats to about $50,000. For singles who apply jointly, the net price is even lower, at about $16,000.
 

Hence, the flat may be viewed as a good long-term investment for eventual resale or rental.
 

In contrast, the price of a similar studio apartment for seniors aged above 55 is about $90,000.
 

The studio apartment comes with wardrobes, kitchen cabinets and flooring, but it is still difficult to comprehend why there is such a big price difference. Studio apartments are also on a 30-year lease, and owners are not allowed to rent out or resell the units.
 

Some seniors are unemployed and may have financial difficulty in purchasing a studio apartment. The price of such units should be reviewed.
 

Can the HDB also enlighten us on the price differential between a new two-room flat and a studio apartment?

Didnt know that you are not allowed to apply for studio apt if you have used up your two chance buying new flat?  Thought most people usually will used up the two chance buying new flat?! I thought you can apply for the studio apt if you are 55 years old and above?!

No choice, you either have to be super low income or super high income group of people here would enjoy most. If you are middle income and not low nor high, then you suffer most.

i only found out about this when i was thinking of applying for the multi-gen flat with my parents.   unless of course there is a separate ruling for those pure studio apartment.
 

also the buy back scheme is flawed not very good too. 
 

IIRC, the buy back scheme, you need to be staying in 3 room flat all your life.. and i think also must be the first flat that you had ever buy.

i think most of these are SG men with foreign wives

if we can allow singles to buy 2 room btos, dont see why we are not allowing SG men with foreign wives to buy 2 room btos



 
 

what if they have kids and the rules still dun allow them to apply for bigger flat? you going to see 4-5 people in the unit.

what if they have kids and the rules still dun allow them to apply for bigger flat? you going to see 4-5 people in the unit.



 

BTO is one of the core pillars and privilege of SG citizenship

if we start allowing foreigners to buy BTOs, then whats the worth of citizenship and how do we deal with the disgrunted voters?

in fact, we should not offer new citizens BTOs as they have take on the responsibilities of citixzenship (National Service) before they are allowed any privileges, but that is another related issue

already, we are bending backwards to meet the needs of singles who are "left out" in this fast moving society

hdb must have received many request asking whether 1/2 SG marrage can apply for single flat. if on their own merits, these SG men can apply for these singles flat, they should be allowed to apply for these 2 room btos

how to ask a female new citizen to do NS?
 

to become a new citizen, these people have already show commitment and contribute to the country one way or another and in years to come. Try asking a 60 years old with no money apply for citizenship you think they will grant him?

I think, actually can get easily if not choosy. See always got leftover flats. If want high floor, close to amenities, mature estate, close to city, then difficult lah.
 

If just want a roof over the head, sure can get easily. Like my fren. He just want a roof. Walk-in n get left over flat. 1st application and got it.

it's good that they allow these ppl to apply for a flat lah..
 

the young and low-income SG that married foreigner wife is a group that need to be taken care . If the SG spouse pass away, the kids and foreigner widow will not have a place to stay if they dont own a flat which comes with mortgage insurance naturally. 

Its good that the government take care of these under-privilege group.
 
 

Tell you hor.. not many sg gal will married man that could only afford a 2-room flat one lah..

50-70 singles to fight for 1 unit

another 50-70 projects with 2-bedder still can be sold out

this is how serious the backlog of housing to meet current (not future 2030 hor) demands?

HUAT AH !!!



 

Funny thing is, authorities curb private developers from building too many shoeboxes apartment despite the red hot demand. Say too many shoeboxes  not healthy, blah, blah, blah.
 

Then the authorities themselves start introducing their own shoeboxes via 2 room flats.
 

Sometimes I dunno who to believe.

71 applications from singles for each Sengkang two-room flat

Published on Aug 05, 2013
 

By Charissa Yong
 

Demand from singles for Sengkang flats continued strong on Monday - the last day for applications for the Build-To-Order application exercise.
 

There are 71.3 singles applying for each Sengkang flat on offer, according to the latest Housing Board (HDB) figures on Monday morning. HDB also received nearly 34 applications for every two-room flat in Yishun.
 

This is the first time singles aged 35 and over can apply for new HDB flats. Up to 30 per cent of the 519 two-room units on offer in Sengkang and Yishun are reserved for them.
 

Overall figures show 50 applications from singles for every two-room flat. The exercise, which started on July 30, closes at midnight on Monday.




Seriously, how many % of these bunch of ppl are seriously buying it to stay? I dare to say majority will just rent or meant for investment purpose.

Cause the price of a BTO 2 room flat is 'cheap', so i believe many singles can afford buying without having to pay super long term house loan, and yet they have a house of their own. Many just buy for the sake of buying, whether it is for own stay, rent out or investment.

Actually now they allow singles to buy 2 room BTO still ok la, cause 2 room flat still not very popular with other group of people, like married couple/families. Overall might still have lots of leftover. If they allow singles to buy BTO 3 room or bigger flat then maybe would upset the system.

Not OK leh. By doing so, the supply of BTO flats for married couples (some with children) becomes lesser. These are actually the group of people who needs a BTO flat more than anyone else. Cos the land area is fixed, so need to allocate 1-2 blocks for 2 room, then there be less blocks to built for 3/4/5 rooms. 
 

The old system is actually, more appropriate.

Though whether they open the application for singles to apply for 2 room flat or not, the total number of units of 2 room flats built already fixed?! They just now allocated additional percentage for singles to apply under the same number of 2 room flats offered in BTO?! So if married couples/families want a 2 room flat, then maybe they will get affected cause lesser chance?!

It is not about lesser chance, rather it is about lesser supply of 3-5 room flats.
 

Couples/families won't go for 2 room flats, especially if they have children.

Yes, why waste time building flat for ppl who don't have a dying need to own a house on their own instead of focusing on the ppl in real needs to have a roof for their family.

This is the first policy that I am not happy about coming from KBw.

Bro..singles or married are all Singaporeans. Electorates also consist of singles and married.
 

To me, all are Singaporeans, and we should consider both singles and married needs fairly. So I guess the best balance is to restrict singles to smaller BTO flats. Furthermore, they define singles as above 35...and quite honestly not many guys at the age of 35 and above still want to be seen staying with their parents or still renting a flat outside. Everybody has a right to feel proud owning their own house, albeit a mickey mouse one.
 

Let's not be all too self centered. Sometimes we need to sacrifice a little for a bigger good.

True is, they do not really need the flat.

Why should the venue be open up to them to invest at the expense of those buying a flat primary to stay in.

He's the biggest contributor to the housing woes today.
 

1. Change from build and sell model to BTO model.

2. Allowing private property owners to buy a resale HDB flat.

3. Allowing HDB upgraders who have bought private property, to live in their private property while renting out their flat.

Singles and couples/ families/ elderly etc etc,  as long as they are Singaporeans should be allowed to buy a hdb flat.  Before one becomes a couple,  one is a single.  And whether single or couple,  down the road,  all become elderly.  There should not be a discrimination that just because one is a single,  his/ her needs are less important or urgent or must be the one who stay with parents or siblings to become unpaid "maid" or " care giver" per se.
 

The BTO  for singles is timely and overdue.  Give them a choice and dun assume their needs are easy or unimportant. 
 

 Safe ride

 Cheers

Aiyoh bro.....who are we to say if they need the flat or not? If the guys are seen by women  not owning any house by 35, they may just be single for the rest of their lives!   
 

Anyway, the authorities can't analyse into individual needs la, they only make policies based on holistic fairness and lifestyle trend

Lol, only singles are rushing to buy 2 room flat. Other then that there is not much demand for 2 room flat. News reported just now that the demand for 2 room flats application from singles for this round of BTO still remains very strong and high!

Not OK leh. By doing so, the supply of BTO flats for married couples (some with children) becomes lesser. These are actually the group of people who needs a BTO flat more than anyone else. Cos the land area is fixed, so need to allocate 1-2 blocks for 2 room, then there be less blocks to built for 3/4/5 rooms. 
 

The old system is actually, more appropriate.



 

With the ramp up in BTO flats the last three years, the demand for BTO flats for married couples has more or less been met. 
 

There are many BTOs now that is seeing application of less than one applicant per flat. 
 

The problem was never demand. It was pegging the bto price to resale market and artificially raising costs for couples. 
 

Yes, couples need a flat. But do they need it more? Most of them are not even married. 
 

A roof under one's head is a basic need. If they meet the income criteria, sell it to them although I think age 30 is more reasonable. Dun ask me why. I just think 35 is tooooo long to wait.

Dont think 2 room will become new norm la, overall the size of the flat is too small, dont think it is enough for families. Maybe 3 room flat should become a new norm, at least 3 room flat have 2 bedrooms.

as long as there are ppl buying they will build. 
 

last time 3 room was the norm until not many ppl want 3 room and most go for 4 room. there was a time that it was impossible to buy a 3 room BTO or walk in selection because the trend was 4 room and up. then not many ppl take excutive apartment, we also see that dying. leaving us with only 5 room.
 

its not difficult to see the trend where by we will see lots of 2 room until the demand dry out. but by then you will have a lot in the market that should had been build at 3 room or above size.

Could be right, the trend now should build lots and lots of 2 room flats due to super high demand from the singles. This demand should need to take few more years before the demand from singles are stabilize a bit.
 

Went to have a quick check on the total application received for the Sep BTO, the application for 2 room flat all exceeded the total number of units available! Except for sembawang and woodlands. But i believe by the time the application closed, even ulu places like sembawang and woodlands also same as the rest.

Exactly.
 

Seriously, I like the policies of MBT. He is firm in his decision and does not bow down easily from public pressure.
 

Seriously, if there are NO restrictions for singles to buy any kind of flat, I believe singles will also apply for 3-5 room BTO flats!!!



 

MBT? U like him? He screwed up the housing price inflation until so high now...it is not abt allowing singles to buy HDB, look at the base of the problem. The government already marked up the land price until beyond the sky and of course.. when u sell high, pple like us have to buy high. The problems become worse when MBT start to "outsource" the HDB to private developers and allow them to fix the pricing... Lastly.. MBT had overjudged the supply and demand market. 
 

He did not build enough to cater for the market and thus more demand less supply.. and what do u think it will happen? The prices will jump no matter what... MBT.... pui..Everywhere he goes... the prices will jump.. good for him but bad for common people like us

Buy 2 room BTO is one thing, if they wanna cash out later on and sell won't be so easy.
 

Buyers for resale 2-room flats are limited, most people would rather top up abit more and/or look for a less "expensive" area and get a 3-room instead, unless the budget is really tight (but if budget is tight then go for BTO lor).
 

Couples - Unless they don't intend to have kids and willing to live in 2-room (not many are)

Singles over 35 - Depending on income, <5k go for BTO, >5k go for 2 room resale or larger (getting financing for 2-room resale not easy, local banks don't lend)

Elderly - There are other options for elderly, eg. studio units

Dont think there is any limitation in resales market.
 

what they can actually do is, buy the 2 room first. 5 years later they buy condo. then rent out the 2 room.

2 room those who can buy likely pay in full liao since its not really that expensive.

Resale 2-room units are not that cheap bro, at least 250-300k.
 

If these buyers can afford to splash out full cash like that, why go through such convoluted means to get only a 2-room flat and deal with MOP etc. How many people with that kind of liquidity would consider living in a <500 sqft 1-bedroom flat?

that is the price of a 3 room lah. until recently then we have 2 room flat in BTO.

I'm not talking about BTO bro, i'm talking about current 2-room flats on the resale market.
 

What i'm saying is that:
 

1. if the singles rushing for the new "cheap" 2-room BTO units are hoping to sell and cash out after their MOP, they are going to find that selling and cashing out is not going to be as easy as they think (limited buyers)
 

2. if they are thinking about earning rental income after MOP, how many of them can afford a condo after MOP? these are people at least 35 years old and earning under 5k a month, not exactly a target audience for condo sales (excluding the occasional exception to the norm). Unless they go back to square one and move back in with parents/family members.

Despite the ramp up in the past few years, there's still a demand for BTO flats for married/families. 
 

I think it is more of a supply problem.
 

Comparing a couple and a single, the former needs a flat more than the latter. If the couple is not married, they would have to ROM within 6 months after getting the keys. If not, flat is forfeited.
 

Age 35 is actually a reasonable gauge because most people get married in late 20s to early 30s....Once >35 then it seems more certain that person would become a single...

Agreed, dont think there will be high demand for 2 room resale flat. When people buy resale flat at least will consider to buy 3 room or bigger if can afford. Even if you are refering to BTO flats, if hdb allow singles to buy 3 room or bigger flat, do you think the demand for 2 room flat would still be so high?!  Cause now singles have no other choice to choose, that's why the singles push up the demand for 2 room flat until so high.

Lol, i know la. But now i am talking about the BTO flats lo.  The sudden increased on the demand of 2 room flat all comes with the new ruling that allow singles to buy lo. Eversince hdb brings back 2 room BTO flat, there is not much demand for this type of flat what. You can see the number of units that were leftover from previous BTO. That's why hdb released all these units in this round of BTO. Something like clearing stock while the demand is still high. If not i guess their 2 room flat only have ghost stay.

The reason why those 39 bucks phone are not that sellable is because they are not a smart phone, just a basic feature phone. In today's world, not many can live without a smartphone.

There are people that buy resale 2-rooms, just that the market is small.
 

The singles 2-room BTOs are for people above 35 and earning less than 5k a month. How many of these people you think can afford to buy a 2-room resale flat costing at least 270-280k and support it on their income and cpf contribution as a single? 
 

Remember Singapore's median gross monthly income is around 3k, so in the rush of eligible singles cheonging for the BTOs, not everyone is earning close to the ceiling. There will be people earning anywhere from 2 to 3 to 4k as well. You think they can afford a close-to-300k resale flat?
 

These are the people still living with their parents or renting a room by themselves. Are some trying their luck since it's relatively cheap? Sure. But you can't say all are applying just because it's cheap and they gian png to make money off these BTOs, there are people who genuinely want a little place of their own but just flat out could not afford anything before this.

This is a better More clear explanation. 
 

For those income just below 5k. The bto is really very cheap. Their cpf can actually pay off the whole flat after the grant.

Can I know which expensive phone has no resale value? 
 

Many people actually buy phones with a mindset that when their telco contract is up, or they anytime want to upgrade, they can sell it off at a "good" price. Isn't this a kind of investment plan too?
 

Yes, the $39 phone is not a smartphone, so nobody wants it. So if you buy it, you are stuck with it forever. You just answered your own question!

Yes perhaps that is true for those earning close to the income ceiling, and i think it's great.
 

Wouldn't it be nice if a married couple could pay off at least a 4-room BTO flat with their combined cpf+grants?

Yes perhaps that is true for those earning close to the income ceiling, and i think it's great.
 

Wouldn't it be nice if a married couple could pay off at least a 4-room BTO flat with their combined cpf+grants?




That is why I say, the policy is flawed. Because single can pay off the flat faster than couple who have twice the income.

This is a better More clear explanation. 
 

For those income just below 5k. The bto is really very cheap. Their cpf can actually pay off the whole flat after the grant.




For people earning around 3k per month, how much will they have in their cpf account by 35 year old which can use to pay off the flat? Cause only ordinary account can use to pay off house loan.

Count in the grant bro. That is why I say not balance. On the whole a single have more grant per person compare to a couple.

Single have more grant also could be fair, cause only one person earn and one person support the house loan lo. Couple have double income.

Double income does not mean more money. 
 

A couple will have double the expenses to pay. And if have children, even higher the expenses.

If 1 person need 1k when single. 2 person need 2k when they become couple.

They don't suddenly become need 1.5k to live nia.
 

Double income also still 2 person. Divide by 2 still same single income.

Agreed, double income doesnt equal to more money. But if refer to buying a house, i feel double income is easier and may able to buy more expensive flat. Cause the price of the house is the same regardless one person paid or two person paid.

Resale flat prices dip for first time since 2009: Q3 flash estimates 

Tuesday, Oct 01, 2013

Daryl Chin

The Straits Times

SINGAPORE - Resale flat prices have dipped for the first time since the start of 2009 going by estimates by the Housing Board (HDB).
 

Get the full story from The Straits Times.
 

Here is the press release from HDB:
 

HDB's flash estimate of the 3rd Quarter 2013 Resale Price Index (RPI) is 205.1, a decline of 0.7 per cent over 2nd Quarter 2013. This is the first decline since 1Q 2009.
 

The RPI provides information on the general price movements in the public residential resale market.
 

The transacted prices of individual flats (by block and flat type) can be found on HDB's website.
 

The RPI for the full quarter and more detailed public housing data for 3rd Quarter 2013 will be released on 25 October 2013.
 

Upcoming Sales Launches 4 HDB is on track to launch 25,000 Build-To-Order (BTO) flats in 2013. To date, HDB had offered 20,161 flats under the BTO exercises and 4,455 balance flats.
 

In Nov 2013, HDB will offer about 4,950 BTO flats in Bukit Batok, Hougang, Jurong West, Sembawang and Woodlands. Concurrently, a n additional supply of about 3,000 flats will be offered in a Sale of Balance Flats exercise. More information on the BTO flats for offer in Nov 2013 is available on the HDB InfoWEB.
 

The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has also released flash estimates for the private residential property index.
 

As for private residential property, URA's flash estimates showed the private residential property index rose 0.8 points to 216.2 points from Q2 to Q3 this year.
 

In the core central region, prices fell 0.5 per cent, more than the 0.2 per cent decline in the previous quarter.
 

Prices in rest of central region decreased for the first time since Q1 2012 by 1.1 per cent.
 

Outside of the central region, prices increased by 2.1 per cent in Q3 2013, which is lower than the 3.8 per cent increase in the previous quarter.
 

Here is the press release from URA:
 

URA RELEASES FLASH 3RD QUARTER 2013 PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY PRICE INDEX
 

The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) released the flash estimate of the price index for private residential property for 3rd Quarter 2013 today.
 

Overall, the private residential property index rose 0.8 points from 215.4 points in 2nd Quarter 2013 to 216.2 points in 3rd Quarter 2013. This represents a moderate increase of 0.4 per cent, compared to the 1.0 per cent increase in the previous quarter.
 

Prices of non-landed private residential properti es in both Core Central Region and Rest of Central Region declined in 3rd Quarter 2013.
 

In Core Central Region, prices fell 0.5 per cent, more than the 0.2 per cent decline in the previous quarter. Prices in Rest of Central Region decreased for the first time since 1st Quarter 2012, by 1.1 per cent, compared with the 0.2 per cent increase in the previous quarter.
 

In Outside Central Region, prices increased by 2.1 per cent in 3rd Quarter 2013, which is lower than the 3.8 per cent increase in the previous quarter.
 

The flash estimates are compiled based on transaction prices given in caveats lodged during the first ten weeks of the quarter supplemen ted by survey data on new units sold by developers in the first two months of the quarter.
 

The statistics will be updated 4 weeks later when URA releases the full real estate statistics for 3rd Quarter 2013, which captures more data on the caveats lodged and the take-up of new projects.
 

Past data have shown that the difference between the quarterly price changes indicated by the flash estimate and the actual price changes could be significant when the change is small.
 

 The public is advised to interpret the flash estimates with caution.

Yeah price of flat pay per person is the same. But 1 person buy flat have more grant pay per person compare to 2 ppl buy flat. You say fair or not??

Fair la, cause only 1 person paying for the flat lo, so must have more grant.   Example like you buy $300K flat, whether single or couple still pay same price. But the single has to pay the whole $300K himself, whereas couple can share the burden of the flat.

I see liao, those so called ulu places for a resale 3 room flat still fetch $300K and more, not much difference from the rest. Unless you tell me the price for the flat at these ulu places is below $300K, then i say cheap.

Though couple can share the burden of the flat, but the profit of selling in future must be share by both. Single taking more grant but can keep all the profits of selling the flat.

I agree with Joseph22 on the grant.
 

combine income never even hit 6k/mth that time but not eligible for any grant.
 

assuming each individual earns 3k..
 

then if that single earns 3k and apply 2 room flat, he got grants.. nnb where got fair!! shouldn't they encourage people to build family and make babies!!
 

btw, those that flock to buy the 2 rooms flat, I think they will suffer in the end unless they stay single for life..
 

1 bedroom apartment, hard to sell coz resale price not worth for young singles. Too small for family. rent out then you stay where!

when the time comes you want to get married, this 1 bedroom apartment hard to shake off hand..

unless you say want to sell to those rich singles, but if they can afford resale 2 room flat, might as well go buy resale 3 room or condo....

god bless those that applied...

That's exactly what I've been saying. Resale market for 2-rm flats has a smaller target market compared to 3-rm and above, plus financing not so easy to get also (if you don't qualify for hdb loan). Those who apply to have a roof over their heads, great for them wish them all the best. Those who cheong who think can make money and cash out after MOP, might realise that it's not as easy to sell as they think.
 

But then again by the time the flats are built and the MOP cleared, already how many years down the road. For all you know we already sunk into the sea because of flooding by then or gone through nuclear or zombie apocalypse. Or our population blown past the 7 million mark (which is about the same as zombie apocalypse if you ask me).

True to some extend, i never find 2 room flat got much resale value lo. Who want to buy a 1 bedroom hdb flat? Esp now hdb allow singles to buy BTO, i guess many singles would rather try for the BTO than buy a resale 2 room flat down the road. Unless the resale price for the 2 room flat is dirt cheap. 
 

So i wonder how many singles who applied for the 2 room BTO now is genuinely want to own a house, rather than thinking to profit from the house after 5 years?!   Anyway, nobody can predict what will happen in future? Maybe hdb ruling change again by allowing singles to buy 3 room flat? Then those who bought a 2 room flat now really 'lose money'.

Actually they should allow new born babies ( Sg Citizen ) to buy a COE to Future BTO flat . This will remove their worry and secure a flat for their new born at tody price . Right now top worry for young parent not giving babies is kids not able to afford HDB flat in future .

 Zero COV transactions on the rise: SRX by Lip Kwok Wai and Olivia Siong POSTED: 06 Oct 2013 21:07


The number of resale flats that have been sold without a cash premium (cash-over-valuation or COV) in July and August has exceeded the numbers seen in the first and second quarters of 2013.
 
- CNA/acSINGAPORE: The number of resale flats that have been sold without a cash premium (cash-over-valuation or COV) in July and August has exceeded the numbers seen in the first and second quarters of 2013.
 
According to the Singapore Real Estate Exchange (SRX), there were 111 zero COV transactions in the third quarter, excluding September -- that is almost triple the number seen in the first quarter of this year (38 zero COV transactions). There were 77 of such transactions in the second quarter.
 
SRX data also showed that four-room resale flats saw the most number of zero COV transactions from January to August out of all the flat types -- with 82 cases recorded. There were 67 three-room flats and 57 five-room units transacted at zero COV during the same period.
 
Property analysts said the increase is a sign that measures like the total debt servicing ratio are taking effect.
While SRX did not reveal the number of resale flats sold below valuation, some property analysts expect there to be more of such cases in at least the next two quarters.
 
Ku Swee Yong, CEO of International Property Advisor, said: "We'll definitely see in the next two quarters at least, more and more cases of negative COVs. And when negative COV transaction data adds up, then the authorities will be adjusting the value, and so valuations will start to go down.
 
"When valuations start to go down, then Cash-Over-Valuations being negative will actually be reduced. So 12 months from today, I believe overall market COV may turn out to be plus minus zero, but with the value trending down by five to 10 per cent."
