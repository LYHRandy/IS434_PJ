Er, the last transaction in Oct for a 1,647 sqft unit was 1,809psf. Other earlier units were transacted from 15++ to 17++psf. People still like this project due to the site size and the location.

My ex-neighbor flipped Seaview ie bought at launch and released it just before TOP and made at least $200k+. Those days no seller's stamp duty and he bought a freehold condo at Thomson Road instead, damn lucky cos he siam this issue and made a quick buck instead

Don't know why the author claims that some buyer can't even sell at 1000 psf....
 
I will surely buy at 1000 psf if market price is 1600.

To be fair.. i was wondering about that also... (afterall.. a disc of 40% off mkt last traded) surely will get buyers..  
 
but.. have a property agent friend who pointed out.. you will never know until you go down a take a look at the exact condition of the unit.. (tho at the back of my head.. still think also cant be so bad rite??) 
 
anyways..  sharing info!

one of my relatives owns a place here. i hate coming to this condo .. worse than a prison camp. so many rules. heck, cant even park overnight .. want to visit my relative - first they must call the unit, if person dont answer in time ... well you LLST wait there in the car until they get notification to let you in.
 
but the quality is as crappy as they say ... the sinks in the toilet - most of the handles have come loose also ... the build quality is pretty shit ... and my relative is the type to take care of the place ... everytime also got flies keep coming up the rubbish chute ...

they make me go by the back from East Coast Rd..meaning you have to turn one big round to get in from the back.

This is a major problem in Singapore.
 
All or most contracts are sub sub sub sub etc etc all the subbing going to the lowest bidder.
No wonder quality is so poor.
 
We owned a condo in Tanjong Rhu at one time.
As far as I know every unit had to have the water piping in the false ceiling replaced because it was poor standard and leaks were developing everywhere.
 
We had the architects around to inspect and comment and hopefully stand the cost of repair.
 
Yeah right.
 
We had the piping replaced and sold the unit.

People are very hard to please .... and I sympathize with the council and the security ... If never call, some residents will complain why never call .... the owner could be sharing intimate moments and do not want any visitors ... whereas some will say so troublesome why everytime have to call....
 
My take ... please respect the house rules of any projects. If anyone kpkb and argue with the security .... it just shows a lack of class.

If this condo comes to $1000 level all the other neighbouring condos will get affected also by some pecentage points especially during current poor market sentiment, but ........ really $1,000 psf is over exaggerated for a fairly new condo; Maybe this $0.99 kongsi got some kind of agenda on this condo; Many new condo's have such teething problems always initially

It says right there.
 
One resident claimed that he was struggling to sell at around $1,000 per square foot (remember, the original price was around $1,600 per square foot). However, his prospective buyer ran into problems with the bank, which refused to grant the loan due to the Seaview’s pending legal issues.

So there you are then. If you really wanted to buy that turd, you'd better do it with FULL CASHTM.

Almost anything involves multi parties to built something.
 
A car maker has many smaller vendor that supplies them parts - i.e. Delphi, Bosch, VDO etc. It is almost like if there is any problem with the car, the responsibility lies with the parts maker and the car maker has zero responsibility.

I trust that MND will step in to set some guidelines for future disputes.
 
Singapore property market quality regulation, the good work accumulated over the years, must not be marred by a few black sheep. Any legal provision for shoddy work will ultimately have the covers blown. This is especially when safety is compromised in any way.

Something else bugs me about this curious case.
 
Firstly, the issues mentioned by the blog, although showcases very poor workmanship and materials used, appears to be mostly easily rectifiable by management funds. Things like planks and pool tiles and doors that are not fitting should have been made known in the first year during the warranty period. The rooftop structure is much trickier and deserves urgent attention. But even then, it should not be as costly as 32 million to rectify? Of course, not an expert here.
 
How do the units look? Is the internal finishing up to standard? Other than the pipe blockage and smell (which is hard to verify unless one is a resident), how come there are no complain about the internal finishing? No supporting pictures of such shoddy work in the units?
 
Then of course there is a claim of selling at 1KPSF which was unsuccessful, which many of us agree is improbable and exaggerated, and not supported by recent caveats.
 
I think there is much more than meets the eye for this case.

Boh Ko Leng leh.. if my car still under warranty, then any parts failed I'll drive back to AD to ge them replace FOC since still under warranty ma... I should not be chasing Hella myself if the horn is not working right?
 
But if after warranty, then is ka ki settle lo... unless is gross manufacturing defect, then the car manufacturer will do mass recall to rectify the mfg problem...
 
Seems like the 1 yr warranty finish liao, but the Seaview still has problems.. and the developer not willing to do "mass recall" to rectify the manufacturing/design defects... so the buyers LLST... sibei suay...

I believe you can outsource function but you cannot outsource liability/accountability. The question is who has the deeper pockets to enforce it in a court of law. Similarly to manufacturer, wholesalers, retailer, distributor etc etc. Liability falls all of them at once. Of course it is useless if the retailer is just a small SME.
 
Base on caveats lodged, either greater fools coming in or there is a knowledge discrepancy somewhere.

Maybe the 1k psf is ground floor PES unit. Those not representative of actual price.
 
I have friends staying at sea view and have been there a couple of times visiting. Think its a pretty nice place actually.
 
If regular unit going for 1k psf, its definitely a steal.

The developer preserve one of the old villa beside Seaview hotel and convert into recreational area I think. according to the Lim's family, this villa got many years of history.

There are units that still have seaview depending on the blocks and facing of the units. 
 
So may be they should market as units will have "natural and silver sea views"
 
But bec silversea height is high, units directly facing it have their views blocked. 
 
At the other end units need to clear Cot Az and Parkway to get the seaview. 
 
Before Silversea was built, blocks 29, 31 have truly beautiful full frontal seaview and the sunrise/sunset just sitting on a chair at balcony/sitting room  was an amazing experience. 
 
Actually just their swim pool view is already quite amazing
 
From what I heard now, the parking problem is much better, just $30 for a second parking lot compared to >$100 previously
 
Multiple exits from the condo and once MRT is up, residents there would really enjoy even greater convenience

tbh, unless you stay in Sentosa those type, SG sea view is nothing much to crow about, just see lots of container ships. I stayed at Laguna Park for a few months rental, ok la, sea view quite nice, very very windy. But also all your metal stuff start to corrode and rust very fast, my guitar strings sit there a few weeks all gone case liao... Also lots of dust and sand gets blown in during the day time. It also gets very sunny.

But also all your metal stuff start to corrode and rust very fast, my guitar strings sit there a few weeks all gone case liao... Also lots of dust and sand gets blown in during the day time. It also gets very sunny. 
 
Wow!  Envy you!

Wow. Didn't realise canals has this side effect. Always thought it was just seaside.
 
I also will not stay next to highway with lots of industrial vehicles.

it depends on the plating done to the materials also bah.
Those faceplates or connectors their plating is thin, so i think the oxidation process is worse.
 
Won't spoil the electronics, just that it makes it look awful. Lol very low resale value for my hifi and computer parts.
benefit is that it's more cooling even though that area is not particularly windy.

ha it's a big enough longkang that it can actually be a small river by sg standards lol.

There are quite a lot of nice peaceful areas actually even among HDB heartlands.
 
Personally i only dislike major roads/junctions and also the west cos there is a lot of industrial vehicles going around there. Both noisy and dangerous for small kids.

I actually have no interest in high rise unblocked view. 
My sister has quite a decent view currently at her condo.
 
I prefer low rise, quiet areas.

my parents' place at Bedok North pt block, 24th floor can see all the way across to east coast and have sea view in the distance. Quite noisy though because at a major junction, noise seems to travel up.
 
my place now facing a power-substation and many trees around , no issues. I like staying on the ground. 
 
 
I think everyone has their own preference and the only way to find out is to stay in them or maybe through experience in airbnb overseas.

That's nice, one of those few blocks with sea view 
 
I have been staying low floor as i have a phobia for heights, my head goes spinning and my legs turn jelly when i look down though high floor is breezy with nice view
 
I hate the occasional mozzies though

Actually I was wondering about this...
 
Is there higher incidence of dengue for landed areas and low floor units compared to units living above a certain floor?
 
Higher incidence as in persons infected per 1000 persons for example.
 
Landed houses got mosquito problems......

Plus one. Somemore got old flats and some BTOs. If you can find the right unit, you can have a view of both Mount Faber and Keppel Bay/Sentosa.

Yeah, that's funny.
Now everyone has to sue the worker doing the actual work.
While the company just back, collect money and relax.

Mer Vue is probably the lame ass name used by WL when they set up a PLC for the Si Vue project.
 
If you have ever read the board erected outside the condo sites, you'll see the developer uses a PLC for their projects.

Basically just don't bother buying new launches. Better to buy resale, at least you know what you're paying for.

yup, developers typically set up single purpose vehicles for projects, one SPV, one project.
