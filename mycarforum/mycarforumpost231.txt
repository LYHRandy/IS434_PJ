anyone kenah this scenario before ?
 

my downstairs neighbor sold his flat abotu 2 months back and the new occupants just moved in.
 

prior to moving in, the new occupants did some renovation works.
 

last week, after the officially moved in for 3 weeks, a HDB officer came to my house and told us that the flat downstairs is complaining that water from our unit is leaking into their toilets from the ceilings !! the officer even told us she was given a VIDEO of the water seeping through the ceiling !!
 

now the HDB officer "offer" us to settle the leaking issue based on the standard HDB absorb 50% and the two owners (upstairs and downstairs) split the balance 50% half/half.
 

I managed to get in touch with the previous occupant and asked them if they ever had any leakage issues when they were staying there and they told me that for the past 20 years, no issue at all !!
 

now the new occupant move in and did renovation works, the ceiling start to leak ?? I am saying that their renovation contractor did a lousy job and caused the ceiling to be compromised and now we, on the upper floor have to pay for their incompetency !!
 

anyone encounter this and did not pay for the rectifications ?

if it is a structural wear, HDB usually will bear some of the charges, even the occupant downstair has to bear some too.
 

i also complaint the water leak from occupant upstair, after complaining few time plus HDB check and seeing MP, finally they fixed the problem but we still bear about $100+ of the work.

likely your renovator didnt do a good job at the beginning. previous neighbour probably didnt bother to complain.

why so negative ?? already said that i called up the previous occupant and asked them if they ever had any leaking issues and they said no.
 

if they did not bother, then they wud have just shot me down when i called them since they no longer staying downstairs.

actually, have a colleague who had the same problem; new occupant downstairs did reno and then after move in, complain about water leakage. Ended up paying $5xx for the works. Was "threatened" that if dun do now, if anything serious happen in the future, he will have to pay 100% by himself.
 

but another colleague's cousin simply refused to pay a single cent at all.

Then get the previous owner to be your witness lor. Call up the HDB officer and tell him that. IMO, at the end of the day, you will still end up having to foot the cost of repair.

Previous owner "A" will not know water leak as previous owner "B" (living a floor below) did not complain.
 

You call "A", he/she will not acknowledge this issue.
 

New owner below notice this problem only when their contractor highlighted it...
 

Pretty common, as old owner did not bother about the paint getting damp. 
 


 

When you try to re-paint, scrap the old paint, then problem starts to be more obvious, re-paint also no use as 1-2 years will re-occur like the above pic.

from my impression, the water proofing layer, sealant and gouting are mainly applied on the flooring of the unit above. i don't suppose such water anti seepage features are so rigorously applied on the ceiling of the unit below.
 

i think it is natural for you to feel aggrieved due to the circumstantial nature of the incident but the fact is the incriminating layer is within your purview so you cannot discount this fact.

Asked HDB a few years and until today still not able to reply: Water leaks intermitently with and without rain from beams and slabs at the void decks. How long can such buildings be safe?

Unequal repairs, shared costs... 

Published on May 2, 2012 
 

FOR the past few years, I have had to put up with spalling concrete on the ceiling and walls of my flat, because the HDB and the previous town council each claimed the other was responsible.
 

In 2010, I had concrete falling from the toilet of my master bedroom, because the person living above my flat did not maintain his unit. I was told that we had to split the cost of repairs.
 

Sadly, the repairs were unequally distributed. The resident above got brand-new tiles for the floor, while I got only a paint job, excluding the plastering that left a gap on my ceiling which the HDB refused to fix.
 

Last month, that is, less than two years after the repairs, my ceiling leaked again because of air-conditioning problems originating from the same resident's premises. 
 

Last week, I received a letter from the HDB saying: 'There is no more ceiling leak at your master bedroom, as such, the matter is treated as closed.'
 

Who is going to pay for the plastering and painting now, since the HDB has stated that I and my upstairs neighbour have to split the cost?
 

There has to be an independent body to mediate in such cases. For ground-floor residents like me to have to bear the cost of leakage originating elsewhere is unfair.

complain to town council and HDB. they will get to the renovator directly. they will settle, if not HDB will void their renovation license and black list them.
 

at least that was what the renovator whom we complain tell us.

very long. all things got holes inside and water can seep through. that is why when we renovate toilet and kitchen, we need to apply anti leak sealant before laying the tiles mah.

generally it's oxidation of the steel bars inside concrete that leads to gaps n leaking.

most likely your waterproofing had worn off.

i am also having problems with the top unit , water is dripping from the ceiling.

now i had also called the HDB to check with the top unit on their waterproofing.

usually the bottom do renovation does not include hacking of ceiling, the dripping will become 

obvious after a new coat of paint is added.

Had the same issue, only I'm the flat below. 

My neighbor upstairs had water seeping into my flat's toilet below, this was happening 

for sometime, HDB came and check and said it wasn't spalling concrete, finally 

last year when I wanted to do a complete reno of the two toilets, 

had HDB come in again to take a look and they agreed it was really spalling concrete

after all. Both, up and down had to pay 50% of the cost, neighbor upstairs had their toilet

flooring hacked out and redone by a HDB approved contractor, all done now. 

No such thing as no need pay, below do reno will not effect the ceiling one. 

I wasn't happy as well, having to pay, then again, I don't have a choice do I?

Take it as paying far lesser for a toilet floor changeover.

The water proofing is a membrane the placed above the concrete floor below the tiles. The membrane is supposed to be water proof on its own. The concrete floor slab if well constructed would also be water proof. Unless during the renovation your neighbour hacked the floor slab and punctured through your waterproofing ( the concrete slab is at least 100mm thick) its unlikely that the renovation caused it.

The water proofing comes with a 10 year warranty from handover to HDB. 
 

And spalling concrete is caused by corrosion of the rebar. Once it rusts it expands, causing the cobcrete to spall. Should not happen to flats less than 20 yrs because HDB started galvanising rebars in toilets 20 years ago. 
 

With the galvanised toilet rebars, the toilets may now leek without spalling

water sipping down is likelihoon the waterproofing work is giving way after certain years..common unless it is major like dripping non stop. Normally happened in old falt with at least 15 years... New flat can only see moist patch.....
