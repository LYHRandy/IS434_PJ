first property downpayment 20% and loan 80%.
 

1% option money to be utlized against the 20% downpayment.  meaning 1%, 19% (2 weeks later to exercise option) and 80% bank loan.  need to also pay stamp duty at time of exercise option stamp duty = PP*3%-5400
 

get a bank to work out your instalment and give in-principle approval so that there is no shock that you cannot borrow that much after you put the option money.  the instalment can be covered by cpf or cash provided your cpf has that amount of money.  in the long term, your cpf withdrawn cannot be more than 120% valuation of your property.

say if i have enough money in my cpf to pay off the 20%, can i use full cpf instead of taking out cash?

also i've read some sites saying that for singaporeans able to take 90% loan

if i am not wrong, 90% case is history already.
 

yes, downpayment can use cpf.  but if i didn't remember wrongly at least 5% must be in cash.
 

means 5% cash+ 15% cpf + stamp duty in cpf

 i think regarding the 1st 20%, 5% need be in cash, the 15% cn be cash or cpf. cpf need to have half min sum i.e. 131k/2 = 65k and any above can be use to pay ur private housing.
 

or this half min sum rule apply only 2nd property purchase

You need to pay 20% cash upfront first, irregardless of how much you have in CPF.  the 20% compromises of 5% cash (cannot use CPF) + 15% pay Cash first then later claim back from your CPF account.  
 

So while in theory you only pay 5% cash, you need on hand 20% cash ready.

the minimum cash requirement now is 10% and the other 10% can be by CPF and 80% by loan. The cash requirement to 10% was part of the cooling measures. Last time can take 90% loan with 5% cash. Hope this helps

5% le......next few forumer post also confirm is 5%
 

actually i rather they revert to good old days of 20% cash way back in 2000 than the current rules.
 

current rules also try to make it more difficult to finance the purchase btu the diference is that current rules allow low cash and much more cpf element.  cpf should be used more for retirement than buying an overpriced house.
 

this runs counter to their grand reason of allowing cpf for retirement.

Still need 20% cash upfront.  Pay first before you claim back from CPF.

a decent condo like parc oasis is already over 1 million! didn't expect it to jump so much at all
 

will i be able to take a bank loan to offset the initial 5%

the 5% is payable upfront right?

Omg, sure, banks can give you credit at 16.88% for unsecured credit, but if you need to even borrow for the 5%, then I think you should just go for a DBSS like me

5% + (3%-$5400) cash
 

If buy FEO project will be even more, about additional +4% cash and the stamp duty cannot use CPF.

Let say 1mil condo.
 

1% option fee so $10k cash

Then once u exercise your option, you gotta pay another:

4% in cash so $40k cash

And 15% can use cpf if you have enough so $150k from cpf ordinary acct
 

So in all u have paid $50k cash and $150k from cpf OA
 

Stamp duty

3% of purchase price - $5.4k 

You can use cpf provided it has not been wiped out. Else it is cash. 

So $24.6k cash/cpf 
 

Legal fees

Your bank can cover a certain amount but it usually costs $2k-ish if it's a very straight forward deal

Usually can be covered by bank fully
 

Then also have to spend some renovation money like: paint, wallpaper, lights, fridge, washing machine, curtains, tv, bed, sofa, dinning table, chairs, whatever 
 

Not forgetting house warming!

I just checked with my RM
 

FEO likes to give vouchers etc. Banks will nett off the vouchers or rebates and Give u a loan based on the nett purchase price so u have to pay more cash upfront. 
 

Not just FEO, according to my RM.a lot of developers are doing this but end up lawyers didn't check until disbursement.

Yes 

Very famous case is wxxdsvixxe 28

Already TOP then now a lot of banks calling up their customers now. All have to claw back the amount in cash because it was stated in the LO the buyers MUST declare any Vouchers or rebates received.
 

If u ask me, the agent, banker are both at fault. Even buyer too; many a times don't ask carefully and thought everything will be settled just like that.
 

Caveat emptor.

This is mandatory under MAS632, the problem is that it is relatively new, and there were different intepretations of the rule and some people are very innovative to get around it, but now MAS is coming hard after the banks and all the banks have to comply.

Word of advice. Previously before the new ruling, people can always refinance their current mortgage loan when there are lower attractive interest rates offered by other banks. But now for bros who have a high home loan rate and are thinking of refinancing it, you have to be aware that the 35 year cap on loan tenure will kick in so you will actually end up paying more per month than what you are paying now..

Condominiums, or condos as people refer to them as, offer all the benefits of living in apartments with all the advantages of home ownership. No yard work is needed. However, there are a few serious condominium downsides an individual should have in mind before purchasing.   Heads up!



 

the drawbacks were for condos buyers in San Francisco. Singapore context is very different..
