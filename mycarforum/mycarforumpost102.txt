All these changes should have been done long time ago! 
 

Fro example:
 

Permanent residents who own a HDB flat will also not be allowed to sublet their entire flat.
 

Permanent residents who own a HDB flat must sell their flat within six months of purchasing a private residential property in Singapore.

lock one room trick is actually illegal and HDB can repossess the flat. 
 

So how does HDB enforce, all singaporeans help out lah. Report them to HDB lor. see they dare or not.

I'm not sure if this is good or bad luck. I just got a queue number in Nov's BTO for a 4 room at Ghim Moh. 
 

HDB has already fixed the prices and I don't think they will be adjusting it. If current resale prices fall substantially (10-20 percent), what incentive do I have to choose my flat in late Feb? 
 

I wonder how many people from this BTO will be declining to choose a flat and instead look towards the resale market.

me in similiar position. Disgusted with the "pro-family" policy that discriminates against single citizens but opens up doors (literally) for PRs. Even resale flat prices have climbed to such heights it makes affordability an real issue for singles (being single income.... ) 
 

for the past 3 years, ppty prices increased at a higher rate than my income &  savings rate. How to afford?  
 

a few of my peers (who are also single and <35 yo) decided to plunge into the private ppty mkt in 2011/12 due to fears of unaffordability in the near future. But they had to max out loans, risking over-leveraging themselves, hoping for job stability (but in the face of a gloomy global economy??) and low interest rates. I have no wish to expose myself to that risk.
 

IMO they will not allow singles to buy BTOs as that is inflationary in nature. Might be hard to swallow. They wld rather "encourage" guys n gals to plunge into rushed marriages and risk runaway brides   (reference the other thread on runaway brides)
 

I hope to be able to afford a place i can call "home" in Johor/msia before prices there escalate to dizzying heights too. Seems the state of johor is alrdy looking into foreign demand pushing up prices... pricing locals out of the mkt.      Maybe have to look further north...

the dream was to rent out the HDB cos it fetches the best rental yield for residential at the moment. I won't say dream burst. Just see whether u want to pay 10% stamp duty. 
 

imo, if the govt is serious, HDB should only be for occupiers, not rentals, as the priority has always been to give affordable housing to Sporeans, not as rental space for FT. 
 

but govt is like that, a lot of times things are for show. This is the latest show.

What makes them think CM7 is enough?
 





 

u must understand cooling measure is not freezing measure. Why would the govt cut down the amount of fees, taxes from property? They wouldn't. But it's to just ensure when crisis comes, there won't be a steep fall in property prices. 
 

This measure does not really affect private property owners. All it takes is a few thousand bucks to register the property under one person's name. As Chrispie pointed out, the ones affected most are current HDB owners who have to sell before they can buy private. So many who bought BTO in 2008, as much as they want to keep for rental, bopian unless pay 10% stamp duty. Well, see who willing lor. Don't be surprised, Sporeans buy property like buy rice sometimes. 
 

The other group affected are developers. Cos many who buy new launches tend to presently own a home. Even if they have money, they will seriously consider paying that extra 10%.
 

at the end of the day, there's only one winner. That's how smart our govt is at making money

IMO they will not allow singles to buy BTOs as that is inflationary in nature. Might be hard to swallow. They wld rather "encourage" guys n gals to plunge into rushed marriages and risk runaway brides   (reference the other thread on runaway brides)
 

I hope to be able to afford a place i can call "home" in Johor/msia before prices there escalate to dizzying heights too. Seems the state of johor is alrdy looking into foreign demand pushing up prices... pricing locals out of the mkt.      Maybe have to look further north...



 

your friends made the right decision as long as they can go back to parents home in the event they lose their job. they can simply rent out their private property to cover loan. anyway, property is a long term plan and it's still one of the best investments as long as don't speculate.

the dream was to rent out the HDB cos it fetches the best rental yield for residential at the moment. I won't say dream burst. Just see whether u want to pay 10% stamp duty. 
 

imo, if the govt is serious, HDB should only be for occupiers, not rentals, as the priority has always been to give affordable housing to Sporeans, not as rental space for FT. 
 

but govt is like that, a lot of times things are for show. This is the latest show.



 

they serious until rent out all the blocks targeted for SERS...
 

like that can earn money faster. You ask them to stop renting? hehe

* rich property investors will not hold back with the ABSD increase.

* HDB up-grader not affected. But their flat need to sell off, meaning a steady supply of HDB flats. So i guess HDB flats prices should stablize.

* First time HDB buyer no affected. In fact, there should be more options and available units now.
 

I personally favor such ruling. It should curb those pte owner taking huge loan for their second pte housing. If this continue, we could face what the americans are suffering today.

me in similiar position. Disgusted with the "pro-family" policy that discriminates against single citizens but opens up doors (literally) for PRs. Even resale flat prices have climbed to such heights it makes affordability an real issue for singles (being single income.... ) 
 

for the past 3 years, ppty prices increased at a higher rate than my income &  savings rate. How to afford?  
 

a few of my peers (who are also single and <35 yo) decided to plunge into the private ppty mkt in 2011/12 due to fears of unaffordability in the near future. But they had to max out loans, risking over-leveraging themselves, hoping for job stability (but in the face of a gloomy global economy??) and low interest rates. I have no wish to expose myself to that risk.
 

IMO they will not allow singles to buy BTOs as that is inflationary in nature. Might be hard to swallow. They wld rather "encourage" guys n gals to plunge into rushed marriages and risk runaway brides   (reference the other thread on runaway brides)

imo, the cooling measures won't work or rather, it makes things worse for the majority of Sporeans. Here's why.
 

1. Ban on PR sublet

This is such a typical policy. Blame the PRs. Yea right, there are so many PRs subletting and therefore, so many flats are locked in rental, creating a resale supply issue. My logic tells me there should be way more Sporeans subletting HDBs than PRs. Of course, are there stats to show the number of PRs subletting compared to Sporeans? 
 

2. Still no policy on COV. 

Give me a break. Govt want to cool prices and quell speculation. One of the most amazing things about public housing is there's no check on how much cash an owner can ask for and a buyer who's willing to pay. If a HDB owner asks for 100k COV and the buyer is willing, it will be 100k, 200k and so on. Cool prices and there's no cap on COV or removal of COV altogether??? Ironically, private market functions better with no COV and reflects market sentiment better. With COV, HDB will always be a cash cow.
 

3. No cake for the middle class

Add on ABSD only lets the rich party more and locking the middle class out of enjoying dual property ownership. Better still, govt earns more stamp duties now. 
 

On your points, what makes HDB prices skyrocket is not a supply issue. It's COV. Have u not read the papers of 200k COVs? Was it due to a supply issue? govt is always like that. Things somehow tend to look so good until we all know what it really means.

As Chrispie pointed out, the ones affected most are current HDB owners who have to sell before they can buy private. So many who bought BTO in 2008, as much as they want to keep for rental, bopian unless pay 10% stamp duty. Well, see who willing lor. Don't be surprised, Sporeans buy property like buy rice sometimes.



 

i did not see any mention that HDB owners can't buy 2nd property and keep the HDB?

Just that there is a ABSD which applies to all 2nd property buyers.
 

Do you all know something that i don't?

to slow down the escalating hdb resale price, perhaps limit the COV to say 10% of valuation (since valuation already fluctuate according to market value) or impose heavy levy on COV.

HDB price increase is due to supply and pte properties hike. Otherwise, why would KBW need to pacify all by releasing more land for HDB?
 

With the new measure and new leases of HDB flats, this is the way to go. First timer and upgrader are the one left behind during this property hype.

Then again, it probably came too late. Nothing is really affordable for this groupies now.

COV is on willing buyer willing seller basic. You can't do anything to it. If you cap it, buyer just pay the seller using under-table way. Then, seller will sell his flat to buyer who give the most undeclared under table money.

like some say impose penalty for those who deal under table, even of some manage to escape, at least no one dare to announce publicly of the record breaking COV, and the other owners would not compete to up the COV.

if one spouse is new citizen and the other is PR consider as PR family or citizen family?
 

Should be citizen right?



 
 

here's the info:
 

6) However, ABSD relief will be provided for joint purchases by married couples with at least one Singaporean spouse (i.e. a married couple with        a Singaporean spouse and PR / foreigner spouse). Such purchases will not be subject to ABSD, as long as both spouses do not own any other property at the time of purchase. This relief facilitates their purchase of a matrimonial home, and puts them in the same position as a married couple with both Singaporean spouses who are purchasing their first residential property.
 

7) ABSD relief will also be provided to eligible married couples with at least one Singaporean spouse, who have purchased a second private residential property and will dispose their existing residential property.
 

(i) The ABSD paid will be refunded if these Singaporean married couples dispose their first property within six months of the purchase of the second property, if the latter property is a completed unit.
 

(ii) If the second property is an uncompleted unit, the refund will be given if the first property is disposed within six months of the Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) or Certificate of Statutory Completion (CSC) date of the second property, whichever is earlier.
 

(iii) These Singaporean couples must also not acquire any other residential property before the disposal of the first residential property, if they wish to avail themselves of the refund on ABSD paid on the second property.

Can buy private but pay 3% BSD + 7% ABSD as it is consider 2nd residential property
 

Since HDB fully paid up, the LTV limit remains 80%, or 60% if the loan tenure exceeds 30 years or the loan period extends beyond the borrower

Our interest rates are closely tied with that of the US interest rates. As long as the US interest rates are kept low.... Singapore will follow suit. But this may not be the case coming next year 2014, where it is expected to creep up slowly as the US economy recovery gains momentum. Even the FED Reserves has hinted that it will not be introducing any QEIII measures.
 

The current US periodic economic data bear testament that its  economy is on the right track (ranging from US consumer data, employment benefits, unemployment rates, housing price) to recover.
 

Coupled with these latest round of cooling measure, the upward price trend in the local property market will be muted in the coming few years,  especially when interest rates rise- those mortgages with floating interest rates will be hit hard..

Still tricky. Geylang might be a better risk, at least near city.

yah man, soft launch was brought forward after the CM announcement, my neighbour have to rush out to SF and quickly contact all his buyers that have signed PP form to go down immediately to sign OTP    heard he work until very very late  



 

It's amazing that most ppl still think that prices will move upwards after the latest CM and that the latest absd will be perm for a long long.
 

Have they ignore the fact that 1) government also say that this is only temp. 2)  after they buy they are locked in for 4 yrs  3) upside for property will be limited given the latest measure. 4) rental yield of property bought at current level rarely cover the cost i.e. rental < instal + pty tax + agent fee + income tax. 
 

Sorry.. but i think these ppl that spend their night at the showflat. maybe walking into a death-trap, if bubble burst within the next 4 yrs. they will be screwed. ** note: most if not all, are buying their 2/3th unit.

Our interest rates are closely tied with that of the US interest rates. As long as the US interest rates are kept low.... Singapore will follow suit. But this may not be the case coming next year 2014, where it is expected to creep up slowly as the US economy recovery gains momentum. Even the FED Reserves has hinted that it will not be introducing any QEIII measures.
 

The current US periodic economic data bear testament that its  economy is on the right track (ranging from US consumer data, employment benefits, unemployment rates, housing price) to recover.
 

Coupled with these latest round of cooling measure, the upward price trend in the local property market will be muted in the coming few years,  especially when interest rates rise- those mortgages with floating interest rates will be hit hard.. 
 

let's wait n c



 

Next 2-3 years will be a perfect storm for sg property
 

1) Lower influx of foreigner/PR->lower demand for property

2) Top of 30-40K unit per year->increase in supply

3) start of the interest raising cycle in US-increase the holding cost of property

Next 2-3 years will be a perfect storm for sg property

1) Lower influx of foreigner/PR->lower demand for property not true, population still increasing. Gov is now saying that if they dun let FT come, the econ tank.. then everyone die together.

2) Top of 30-40K unit per year->increase in supply big numbers.. but still not enuff to cover the shortfall / new family/ FT/FW

3) start of the interest raising cycle in US-increase the holding cost of propertyUnlikely, since US data is still not very healthy



 

Aniway.. the only fear now is that econ really tank... if world econ continue to get worse, i dun see how sg can escape totally. when that happens, interest rate high or low will not be a issue. Now interest rate so low, still US housing mkt is weak.. EU pty mkt also..
 

So just watch for big company to start calling for help.... mkt will correct itself..

buy new launch is capital gain cos zero rental for now. whether bubble burst or not depends on govt, who i think won't allow it to burst. US economy is picking so it can benefit our economy. Govt CM is not to burst bubble, but to limit growth. 
 

my guess is those who buy are not sudden buyers, but wanted to buy for some time but waiting for price to come down. 
 

in property there are 3 possibilities- rise, flat, fall. 
 

u bet on fall, u r taking a bet against 66.6%. yr odds of losing are higher.

these are not sudden buyers.. but irrational buyers....
 

say.. mkt flat, rental at this price hardly cover cost, on top of that you are subjected to 4 yrs lock-in.

the odds of gaining ,by rushing in now, is actually 33% only not 66%... i.e. only if prices rise and does not include the scenerio if it is flat.
 

Also not forgetting that if the mkt really fall, the measure may be lifted.

i don't understand when ppl link housing to interest rates as the main factor. while it's not wrong, the main factor is the economy. even for a one mil home, a rise to 3% is just a couple of hundreds, which in good days (likely to be so since US is on the rise), most owners can tahan. but lose job, give u zero percent interest also cannot tahan. cos in a bad economy, rental will also be difficult to get. so bring on the rise of US.

Please think again..remember these are not 1st pty owners since 1pty owner is not affected.....

 if mkt flat.. what you do with the unit ? sell.. you lose your stamp duty and bank charges and legal charges .. if you rent out.. cost is higher than yield...

btw, i need to add u don't bet for the next 4 yrs. that's not a fundamental in property investment. 
 

Raffles came 200 years ago and he certainly didn't think in 4 years, SG will be super rich. 
 

the fundamental would be to hold for rental, rise or flat. tats what i would do. Property and inflation go hand in hand. if 10 years later flat, then not too bad la. at least my bowl of noodles will cost the same. but thats very unlikely.
 

& the question i pose to u is if u have 200k now, what u do? Put in bank? If don't believe in property fine, but pls do something with it cos being risk averse gets u nowhere.

it is not whether or not you can tahan lah....
 

It is whether it make sense to HOLD on to your property. When the interest rates rise, the rental is not enough to even cover the interest from the bank loan. Every month you are losing money. Even if you got plently of money, you will still sell.
 

Worse, everyone can see this so everyone is rushing to sell before the price fall. Simple logic. If prices is falling, even if you have money you will not keep it.
 

If prices is rising, even if you have NO MONEY, you will beg/borrow to buy it.

I think the restrict on the use of CPF on property with less than 60 year lease and the mortgage ratio will come down hard of the expensive EM. It will def shrink the pool of buyers for this type of hdb. And prices will moderate when seller are more desperate than buyers.

I certainly beg to differ.  

Doing nothing now doesnt mean always doing nothing.

Keeping liquidity to enable opportunistic strikes is certainly not a bad option.
 

Doing nothing ensures that your losses are limited.  

That in itself is a strategy which allows you to then concentrate doing other things as long as you hv accepted the limited losses.
 

Just becos you dont want to not do nothing and then go and anyhow do something, now THAT is the worst option.

High gearing n low rates boost returns, in other words a quite safe low cash yield asset becomes higher risk due to gearing used on it, therefore one should treat this asset as higher risk than if bought w all cash. To assume property is always stable coz it's lower risk than stock mkt is a mistake when it has high gearing applied. Depending on gearing amount, it cld b equal or higher risk than stock mkt.

this is stock market mentality. property is about holding power. not disagreeing with u. but interest rates, while impt, are not as critical as a good economy.



 

The significance of interest rate cannot be under-stressed. 
 

Interest rates in Singapore are dictated by the trend of US interest rates. It is no secret that US Federal Reserves  has a long history of adjusting interest rate to arrest any runaway or hyper inflation that may drag the US economy into recession.  You will notice that our MAS has never utilized the level of our  interest rates as one of the property cooling measures. 
 

Historically, there is an inverse relationship between rising interest rate and overall economy.  Rising interest rates dampens investment, consumption, company bottom-line, share market, property market etc. while it can also moderate inflation and exchange rates. 
 

This is a chicken and egg issue. Yes, the health of the property market is dependent on a good economy.  However, the appropriate level of interest is one of the few key factors that is vital to a sustainable growing economy. Any unfavorable interest rates can quickly turn any good economy into bad and eventually dragging the property market. 
 

Those who may not seem to be over-commit financially now may find themselves in hot soups during bad times or prolonged periods of high interests rates.

The runaway increases in our  property prices over the last few years are not adequately supported by fundamentals.  
 

The poor economy showing coupled with rising property prices is already first such symptoms which many people obviously chosen to ignore and jump onto the band-wagon. 
 

A property bubble is already in the making. I understand that most people (especially recent property purchasers for investment) are still in a state of denial. 
 

The next issue over the next couple of years is whether the unsustainable property market will have a soft or hard landing.

Its hard to tell cos we just dunno what kind of ppl are buying property. Maybe they are just well off, especially the bigger units n those more central areas. My guess is thrs just too many rich ppl in sg.

PR should not be allowed to buy HDB.  If they buy they should give an undertaking that by certain time frame say 5 years they must be a citizen. If they sell the HDB house before becoming citizen they must given back the difference to government who in turn should donoate to charity

property investment is for long term

knee jerk reaction does not affect property investor but flipper and overleverage speculator
 

let's say a $1M property drop 10% = $900k , drop 15% = $850k

but, if the properry is hold for 8-10 years, the price probably $1.5M-$2M in view of spore land scarce and the sibei huge aspiration of people to buy property
 

just look around, 10+ years ago hdb price vs today price ...

there is no way to get back 10+ years ago price ... it is a one-way traffic

was reading from another forum.. some guy bought a overpriced hdb ard in 1999.. until now only breakeven.. if count in interest, still in the red. 

At the end of the day. muz buy with eyes open and not rush in. 
 

I think there is simply too much hype abit SK/Punggol.. just like Bishan/CCK , 10 yrs back. Seriously, i really dun think that ppl that rush in on Friday will be rewarded.

Actually, the ppl that queued to buy is not very clever either.. If they wait 2-3 mths, you will probably gett a better price with the developer.. Ard the 5-6th mth after a new measure, then mkt chong again.
 

Aniway, although i dun see any reason for pty mkt to crash given that demand is still very high...

But it's quite scary to see ppl rushing in , even when such harsh measure are put in place. * be fearful when everyone is greedy*.

i guess this time round.. higher downpayment and lower loan to valuation ... really kill alot of speculators. With the current low rental yield, i dun really see any upside if there is no capital appreciation for SK/Punggol units.
 

aniway, not all property recovers from a cooling measure. Personally, i think this time OCR/HDB will be the hard-hit. CCR/RCR shld just be remain as it is...if hot $$ come also will hit CCR/RCR... the OCR/HDB pricing now is a bubble..

I think this new team in white are moving in the right direction. Understand the they cannot just stop PRs from buying open market like that. So they do this a baby step at a time, and eventually they will disallow the PRs from owning even a open market HDB. They baby steps of squeezing the PRs gradually out of HDB, also to avoid a sudden correction in the market. More gradual tightening to come, also partially to address citizens disagreement of HDB to be own by PRs and others.

Strong liquidity is about to reach it's high. This really makes me scary in the next few years about property market here. It turning soon and we do not know when the turn for the worst to come.  Interest rate may set to normalize sooner than few years' time. Just a caution note for those, who have their loans of 50% or more to their salaries. Is almost without any buffers, when one lost a job or health turn for the worst.

they chiong to siam measure. developer give discount? if they are too poor, they probably will. Companies like Far East will hold until doomsday. 
 

If the govt think the cooling measures will make the developers bite, they better have awarded bids to poor developers. In the end, the ones who are able to hold will simply tell u give them the price or they won't even think of selling. so the cooling measure is good in a way where it separates the able buyers from the phony ones. & of cos, the rich keep getting richer again. 
 

no govt will want its citizens to be too rich. imagine everyone rich who do dirty work. It's the survival of the fittest here.

stating that total property loans given out by banks are 
 

less than half of total value of property value transacted in 2012
 

which means many people bought with cash

Buyers in Singapore may be strong buyers with tons of $$$. However, most of them have only one  motive;  profit maximization. Yes, they may have relatively strong holding powers. However, in a prolonged economy downturn, pessimism and erosion of confidence are very real.  Just remember that there is an opportunity cost for each dollar you saved or invested.
 

When they realize their ROI is a fallacy.... I bet that they will cash out from the market especially when the rental market starts to slump and invest in alternative products/markets. This is especially so institutional investors, they can  move their monies around the globe in seconds. 
 

Currently, everybody in the property market is singing the same song as though the property price will never fall. This is a real danger. Everybody is rushing in herds to purchasing as though $1M suburbs condominium like the annual Singapore sales. 
 

Currently, the property is currently like a bull share market, the fact that our government came up with 9 rounds of cooling measures within last 3 years (i.e. 2009) is already a good sign that the Government is extremely concerned about the property frenzy this time round. They are just short of labeling this property market as a property bubble. 
 

Remember during the 1997 financial crisis? properties prices in Thailand and Hong Kong experienced similar unprecedented surges before they fell off the cliff the next moment. 
 

I believe that Singapore has not really experienced so much of "negative equity"  in the past  when the outstanding mortgages are exceed the property values. How could this be possible? Do a search online and it happens in Hong Kong. And when if it really happens here, suicide rates and divorce rates will go up. Those with HDB loans will still be safe while those investors with bank loans will be in a precarious state.
 

Likewise, any prices increase not supported by fundamental are not sustainable. Asset inflation due to speculation like what we experience currently in Singapore does not add REAL value to our Economy. 
 

As someone here rightly points out that this year or next year will be a perfect storm - high COE price, high property price, strong SGD dollar but poor economy outlook, increased interest rates.

this is stock market mentality. property is about holding power. not disagreeing with u. but interest rates, while impt, are not as critical as a good economy.



 

From investor point of view, the only difference between stock and property is liquidity. The so called "holding power" is just like bury your head into the sand when you property price go down and pretend nothing has happened.
 

Pro make their investment based on return per year. Amateur self-console themselves by having "holding power" when thing goes wrong.
 

There is no ultimate sure win asset class in investment. It is all about timing and stays inside your circle of competence.

I completely agree!
 

However the the housing price is supported by fundamentals.
 

The population increased from 3.2 mil to 5.41 mil and
 

the supply of housing has not kept pace.
 

Isn't an increase in demand and a lack of supply fundamentals?
 

A lot people says the price rise is due to speculation.
 

What is speculation? I buy something I have no use for like
 

a tulip flower for $100 hoping it will go up to $120 or $130 
 

and then sell it. However if no one continues the bubble, the
 

price falls to 50 cents a tulip cos that the real price.
 

A tulip we can do without but housing the 5.41 mil we cannot do without!
 

Along with transport and food so expect the prices of all these to go up more.
 

And expect the share price of transport companies and food companies to go up too.

I completely agree!
 

However the the housing price is supported by fundamentals.
 

The population increased from 3.2 mil to 5.41 mil and
 

the supply of housing has not kept pace.
 

Isn't an increase in demand and a lack of supply fundamentals?
 

A lot people says the price rise is due to speculation.
 

What is speculation? I buy something I have no use for like
 

a tulip flower for $100 hoping it will go up to $120 or $130 
 

and then sell it. However if no one continues the bubble, the
 

price falls to 50 cents a tulip cos that the real price.
 

A tulip we can do without but housing the 5.41 mil we cannot do without!
 

Along with transport and food so expect the prices of all these to go up more.

U r looking at historical data. Have u tried forecasting forward supply demand? Before n after GE2011 have totally diff FT policies

wake up! those people got rich by selling you their development. You won't see CDL holds billion dollar of houses for investment.




Then i assume they hold millions of dollars in property. Which also means we should hold some properties within our means. Thanks for the wake up call.

This cooling measure looked fierce compare to the previous ones.
 

 Over regulating a free market may not be a good thing. But not regulating at all will cost you votes.
 

The issue will come when there is a downturn and the authorities could not unwind the measures fast enough.  The consequences can be disastrous when that happens.
 

Downturn cycles often come suddenly and fast, and nobody can predict what would happen next. Should we unwind the measures now or should we wait.? Like a man who has lost money in his stocks, he will often be in dilemma whether to wait for it to rebound or should he just cut loss. Make the wrong choice, and live to regret the consequences.
 

So  I hope the regulators have a set of formula ready telling them when and how fast to unwind when a downturn hits. They didn't do very well in 97.

From investor point of view, the only difference between stock and property is liquidity. The so called "holding power" is just like bury your head into the sand when you property price go down and pretend nothing has happened.
 

Pro make their investment based on return per year. Amateur self-console themselves by having "holding power" when thing goes wrong.
 

There is no ultimate sure win asset class in investment. It is all about timing and stays inside your circle of competence.




no stock and property is different in singapore. in other countries they are about the same but in sg, land scarcity make property a different investment as it will aprreciate along the time, especially when economy is good. Its just a matter of holding power, if u can hold that property for 10 years, then u can make a profit by  then

that extra fund will eventually benefit u as u dont need to loan more and pay more interest. except for the ABSD, i find the the LTV of new cooling measure is much more realistic as it will prevent tom dick harry to get 2nd property which hike the price up unless they got more cash in hand

not just in SG but in many cramp cities in the world. Prices hardly come down or if so, just slight dips at best.

yah higher LTV at least will make people to borrow less and when in econ downturn, people will not have much worry to pay their mortgages. 
 

think one day they should suggest 40% LTV for 2nd property and min cash 30-40%. Same to car plus no loan for COE

Ultimately if the downturn comes and unwinding the measures cannot stop the price slide... what does it show??? It shows that the property market is way over priced and the correction is not because of the CM.
 

Thus either way, it is better err on the safe side and pile up the CM harder. I think CM1, CM2, CM3, CM4, CM5, CM6 has shown that previously, the government is has really been too cautious.

historical data is important especially if u look long term. And long term, property has NEVER been on a downward trend. Will a bowl of noodles cost the same 10, 20, 30 years from now? What makes a bowl of noodles more expensive? I can assure you property is one of the reasons. That's why the experts keep saying property is the best hedge against inflation. 
 

Now, there's really no point arguing who's right who's wrong. I believe the advocates of property are not saying just go and buy any property with or without the means. The advocates are saying long term, property is a good investment. 
 

Like what Andy Ong from ERC taught about property. He said you can only learn from those richer than you. He also said many Sporeans will be burnt by property for investing blindly. Listen to the gurus. If you have money, put it on a good location. When you make, share your success story here. When you don't make, but make 30 years later, it's still a make.

Lot of opinions but the two schools of thought are clear.

People who are invested in property justifying why prices will be maintained and grow over long term.

People who want to buy and missed the boat earlier giving reasons why prices will fall.

Same story every time we have cooling measures or some economic disaster happening. 
 

But govt can only do so much till global interest rates are so low and world is flooded with easy liquidity. Key factor will be when the Fed starts incoreasing interest rates. And they have clearly stated that it will only happen once unemployment rate falls to 6.5%. According to forecasts that might take 3-5 years.
 

I believe the new measures will not impact the first time buyers who have enough cash (or support from parents) including PRs.

But people who are looking to invest in 2nd or 3rd property will have to rethink of other investment options in short term. 

Rentals wil stay high and with low interest rates there will be no pressure on existing owners to sell property at a lower rate.

I read in today's papers on some interviewed... they will wait to see if price drop to the level they think it is good to buy. If prove drop and bounce back, miss the boat again they will complain again. 
 

And after buying, I am sure they hope price will not fall further. If price continue to drop, knn sure complain again. 
 

Better still ask garman draw out the property price forecast chart in the next few years for all of us to plan our purchases.

I certainly beg to differ.  

Doing nothing now doesnt mean always doing nothing.

Keeping liquidity to enable opportunistic strikes is certainly not a bad option.
 

Doing nothing ensures that your losses are limited.  

That in itself is a strategy which allows you to then concentrate doing other things as long as you hv accepted the limited losses.
 

Just becos you dont want to not do nothing and then go and anyhow do something, now THAT is the worst option.

imo, the cooling measures won't work or rather, it makes things worse for the majority of Sporeans. Here's why.
 

1. Ban on PR sublet

This is such a typical policy. Blame the PRs. Yea right, there are so many PRs subletting and therefore, so many flats are locked in rental, creating a resale supply issue. My logic tells me there should be way more Sporeans subletting HDBs than PRs. Of course, are there stats to show the number of PRs subletting compared to Sporeans? 



In reply , Singaporean profit from rental what is wrong , some singaporeans are fighting for lower wages jobs and foreigners are forcing our lesser educated out of jobs , the only way to get income is by subletting, we singaporeans are protecting the country not PRs ,to me we benefit from it it is no problem , This place is Singapore and rentals income should remain in Singapore. The only people kpkb are only the PRs and property agents.
 
 
 
 

2. Still no policy on COV. 

Give me a break. Govt want to cool prices and quell speculation. One of the most amazing things about public housing is there's no check on how much cash an owner can ask for and a buyer who's willing to pay. If a HDB owner asks for 100k COV and the buyer is willing, it will be 100k, 200k and so on. Cool prices and there's no cap on COV or removal of COV altogether??? Ironically, private market functions better with no COV and reflects market sentiment better. With COV, HDB will always be a cash cow.
 

Cov is a subjective thingy , willing buyer willing seller , doesn't affect the housing pricing that much unless it is a foreigner flushed with cash trying to spoil the market.
 
 

3. No cake for the middle class

Add on ABSD only lets the rich party more and locking the middle class out of enjoying dual property ownership. Better still, govt earns more stamp duties now. 
 

On your points, what makes HDB prices skyrocket is not a supply issue. It's COV. Have u not read the papers of 200k COVs? Was it due to a supply issue? govt is always like that. Things somehow tend to look so good until we all know what it really means.
 
 

Actually if the garmen totally disallow PRs from buying public housing or they will be slap with a ruling that prevent them from profiting from a sale , there won't be a supply issue. The issue only occurred when. By the way , the high COVs are caused by PRs, while u claim that others don't read the papers , my dear friend , i think you are only talking about one side of the picture.

So easy to talk on paper , try doing it before you talk . If cannot do it , talk more also useless . Yes economy mismanagement , so any bright ideas on how to improve ? Write into the PAP or HDB or to Mr Khaw.

no need to argue ... rich always 'eat' the sandwich class for breakfast, lunch and dinner be it sporean or PR

buy condo before it is officially launch and sell to you at a premium

buy private and hold on to the hdb for rental

buy the largest ec penthouse under their son/daughter name

25% downpayment or 50% LTV affects the sandwich class more than richie ...

no garmen manages 100% well lah, just some better than others. The problem being garmen is jumping d gun. Many property analysts say garmen shld have done these measures 1 year ago, but as garmen its v dangerous to jump d gun in case it backfires on them, therefore theres always a lagging effect to their policies because they will delay n deliberate etc etc n confirm plus chop first before making any moves, coz aside from economic performance, garmen policies affect asset prices d most.

btw, i need to add u don't bet for the next 4 yrs. that's not a fundamental in property investment. 
 

Raffles came 200 years ago and he certainly didn't think in 4 years, SG will be super rich. 
 

the fundamental would be to hold for rental, rise or flat. tats what i would do. Property and inflation go hand in hand. if 10 years later flat, then not too bad la. at least my bowl of noodles will cost the same. but thats very unlikely.
 

& the question i pose to u is if u have 200k now, what u do? Put in bank? If don't believe in property fine, but pls do something with it cos being risk averse gets u nowhere.



 
 

For me , 200k is best kept in cash at this present time .
 

1. You don't know when you will lose your job . It comes in handy. 
 

2. Market economy isn't really doing well , a matter of time before things start crashing , either by policy or by force. I prefer by policy at least it is controlled. Lesser people die. Don't come and c--k and bull story with me , i am in the credit department , don't come and talk those economic thingy with me i know better than u. The banks has being coming up with preventive measure since mid last year.
 

3. to me , 200k at this present juncture is peanuts , u can't even buy a sportcar. So to me , it is best in cash waiting for things to go drop back to a cheap price , to me markets rise markets fall . if it doesn't fall , so be it. YOU WON'T LOSE A CENT. You can continue to save up another 200k. I am risk adverse and i believe in buying things at the right price , am i made poorer? I doubt so. 
 

4. Since when inflation and property comes hand in hand , it is the perceived demand which is fueling inflation of property prices. Look at Spain , US and even Ireland , after growing for a few years , now they are at prices 10~15 years ago. By the way , even china is having problems with property. You don't even know what dirty laundry they have.

For garmen to do things , not like some kids here or some auntie talking in the market. You want to pass a ruling , you need to go through alot of people. Some of them are rich and are probably affected by the current ruling. Not so easy one.
 

I just wanted to highlight some of the potential issues from a case study i did some time back on US , where people just bankrolled their property and "flipping". The banks know that sooner or later something is going to happen but to them they are only thinking about maximising their pockets so they max leveraged everything. Look what is the end result. Everyone is made poorer when the song runs out.
 

In sg , it is not different if garment don't step it. I would rather let the garmen be too early to stamp out potential problems than to wait for crap to happen. Yes , they will be unhappy people but if you wait til the thing topples , not only you have unhappy people , you would have people out of jobs and it would affect a whole chain of other businesses. So sometimes , some people talk based on their own selfish wants. It doesn't help the economy.

they chiong to siam measure. developer give discount? if they are too poor, they probably will. Companies like Far East will hold until doomsday. 
 

If the govt think the cooling measures will make the developers bite, they better have awarded bids to poor developers. In the end, the ones who are able to hold will simply tell u give them the price or they won't even think of selling. so the cooling measure is good in a way where it separates the able buyers from the phony ones. & of cos, the rich keep getting richer again. 
 

no govt will want its citizens to be too rich. imagine everyone rich who do dirty work. It's the survival of the fittest here.



 

How are you so sure? Are you rich? How can you benefit from the present ruling if you are rich? Or are you from the banks knowing what the loans will affect the properties companies and what will they do? The rich stay rich , this i agree , they will make mistakes at times and fall off. The cooling measures is good in preventing the wannabe speculators which are helping to fuel the inflation of properties here. 
 

The rich are happily sitting at the back waiting to offload their investments since they don't need the money. In fact i have already known of a few rich which has offloaded quite an amount of their properties and are at the side enjoying life as it is. Irregardless what they do , they know when to buy and what to buy. You can't stop them , you can either follow or just stay at the side. Survival of the fittest? By the way , the dirty work are rarely being done by locals.
 

I am witch hunting but this fellow is talking nonsense.

I said , invest at the right price and probably at the right time. 
 

My view is now it is not a good time to buy property . I would rather keep my money in the bank. Just an example , if one intends to buy a property thinking that they are able to "make" money using their 200k and i am assuming 2nd property, given current conditions. 
 

They would probably be needing to come out with at least 30% cash and with 200k what kind of investments are you going to talk about? A peanut single bedroom apartment? What would the rental yields be for this kind of peanut apartments? What kind of risk are you intending to put one into by committing into such places which cost anything lesser than 400k some time back.
 

Any decent property would require at least 1.4mil and based on your 200k you will still need to "borrow" . So tell me how are you going to bank roll the extra money ? Borrow and put yourself at more risk? 
 

Maybe you can show me using 200k what you can invest in and we can discuss on it.

i did say there are other options besides property. There's stocks, overseas property, funds etc. 
 

As for property, i won't go as far as to say there is no single property that is a good investment now. Yes, one can be burnt by buying blindly, in fact anything can be burnt if no research is done. The 200k is just a figure sum and certainly not meant to say the only channel for that is property.

Dude downgrading , it would have meant , someone is buying their landed from them. So at the end of the day , someone buying that landed from them either upgraded or suddenly became rich enough to buy from them. So there is a cause and effect here , money remains in singapore. As for bishan , it cost closed to 1mil back in the 90s, many til now are still sitting on paper losses, til now still 1mil plus nia pricing in inflation , actually ok mah.
 

By the way , i am just asking how many times can one "profit" from it? For locals , the money remains in Singapore, i don't see what is the problem . For foreigners , they buy and speculate , at the end of the day , the money moves elsewhere when markets here turns stale , there is alot of difference here.

Again , stocks and overseas properties elsewhere doesn't have anything to do here. So it is kinda of out of point. To me , when one is proposing a number only to say it is a figure sum is akin to not taking responsibility on whatever bs he has mentioned and eating back on his words.

You are wrong, new hdbs are still quite affordable in the less matured areas. So what kind of crap are you talking about being hard to buy a hdb. If you are telling me you wanna buy a specific place , of course you need to pay. This one is not a legit point here.

taking responsibility? woah...this is only a forum for airing our views. no money earned. my view is there are financial instruments for investments if one is not into property. if u think i cannot mention this in this topic, let the mods know.

You ask me for an opinion i gave you one , when i ask you for yours , you tell me something else.  Anyway , for me i am doing my fair bit to inform the people about the misconcept on property and the potential problems they may run into.

I'm not sure if this is good or bad luck. I just got a queue number in Nov's BTO for a 4 room at Ghim Moh. 
 

HDB has already fixed the prices and I don't think they will be adjusting it. If current resale prices fall substantially (10-20 percent), what incentive do I have to choose my flat in late Feb? 
 

I wonder how many people from this BTO will be declining to choose a flat and instead look towards the resale market.



 

go for it man! new 4-room flat at below 500k, mature estate and within walking distance to Bouna Vista MRT leh.. don't tio gong tao by the new cooling measures haha

Yeah , back fire when they give the free trial and end up taking the lousy side of the deal. Should have being , PR for limited years not renewable(e.g 5 years) either take up citizenship or return. The problem is they have being giving free trials with unlimited expiry. 
 

As for public housing , they should be this way , stamp duty gao gao for PRs and non Singaporeans. To prevent them from profiting from it. Want to enjoy benefit , be a Singaporean and contribute. 
 

The problem arises when , they wanna earn the tax of these people by opening the PR to public housing and laxing on the entry only to tighten it recently when they found many abusing the structure.

Shortsighted. 
 

If you think this is a good policy, then you offer a five year work permit or similar.  And make "PR" harder to get. 
 

Take a look at the word, it is permanent residency,  not 5 year right of domicile or anything else like that. 
 

Not saying it is neccessarily a bad idea to make permanent residency harder to get - I think that would be good, I am saying you don't give permanent residency and then take it away five years later - you choose carefully in the first place.

1. first pty, that you will be staying in, choose something where you think of worst case scenarios. Make sure u still have a roof over your head when things crashing and you can wait it out.
 

2. for subsequent ones, make sure u know when to exit, be it profit or loss. And you have means to hold it out to the exit point.
 

then i think you will be ok lah..

Based on my limited knowledge , PRs should be limited to a certain type of property and to me if that resident isn't economically productive , why give similar entitlements to them without having the same lablities ? If it would be me , I would still stick the idea of 5 year permanent residency which can or cannot be renewable , judge based on whether if that person is worth to keep.
 

Tighter measure should be in place in selection of these PRs and I still stick to my stand that PRs are just a temporary status and shouldn't be permanent . In many countries , their PR status aren't permanent as well. Maybe they should change the wording permanent residence to permitable residence. The word permanent seems to give the idea of the wrong thing they think they are entitled to.

then why ask PR to go NS?



 

FYI, only 2nd gen male PRs and many run road without serving. There are plenty of PRs who did not serve NS and are owning HDB properties. Would you appreciate the ruling being changed so that only PRs who served are allowed to own HDB ppties and when they do, they get the closer to privileges as Singaporeans as right now?

go take your enjoy life lah knn whole day think of property stress your brain only. I dont have any mortgage now, so feel relax doing my daily work. For property investment to stress until like that not healthy. Take a break, settle your loans, life is more than making $.
 

It is the mortgage loans that stress people, not so much the property itself.

The problem is the loan only 30% of income for monthly payment and d/p 50%.




means he's not cash rich enough to buy even discount more also he can't afford.

tats y in the end, some couples make hasty decisions and try for bto. every policy got pros and cons. valuation should be enough to let ppl play play also. like private homes. just value it and ppl play play after that.

some mortgages can be good as it can work for u. but if too heavily dependent on rental, then it's too scary as when times are bad, u can't really lower rent to attract tenants.

Timing the market is a gamble. 
 

Do it right and you reap the reward. Do it wrongly and you will be stuck w/o a house.
 

The latest set of measures is quite targeted towards Singaporeans who are planning to buy their second property. Looks like the aim is to free up the supply for first timers. Looking at the way ECs are snapped up and BTOs are oversubscribed, it's pretty obvious there's a lot of pent-up demand which has not been met.
 

Anyway, it's still early days to see how this new CM will pan out. Around 3-4 months down the road should give a clearer indication on how successful it is. For those hoping for a crash, I'm sorry to say this is not the intention of MAS. Their goal is to slow down the price rise and redistribute the demand/supply. Crashing the market is both an economic and political suicide. Cos if MAS really want to bring down the property price fast, there is no better way then to implement capital gain tax.

Got already: 4years of SSD is even worse than capital gains bro, its gross value tax, not even capital gains. 
 

Next wld b commercial/retail as that sector no SSD yet hehehe
 

anyway for long term investors, this chart is telling. Best time to buy? When yields expand, same way to approach REITs/dividend stocks.

I certainly beg to differ.  

Doing nothing now doesnt mean always doing nothing.

Keeping liquidity to enable opportunistic strikes is certainly not a bad option.
 

Doing nothing ensures that your losses are limited.  

That in itself is a strategy which allows you to then concentrate doing other things as long as you hv accepted the limited losses.
 

Just becos you dont want to not do nothing and then go and anyhow do something, now THAT is the worst option.
 





 

Agree. Taking time into consideration. Doing nothing is a strategic decision by itself.

I'm not sure if this is good or bad luck. I just got a queue number in Nov's BTO for a 4 room at Ghim Moh. 

HDB has already fixed the prices and I don't think they will be adjusting it. If current resale prices fall substantially (10-20 percent), what incentive do I have to choose my flat in late Feb? 

I wonder how many people from this BTO will be declining to choose a flat and instead look towards the resale market.



 

Since you are getting a BTO, i assume you have no other properties and this is will be your residence.
 

I think first and foremost question you need to answer is why are you moving? 

1) moving because you want a better pty ? in terms of location , age of the flat. 

Then GM is great, with the new mall nearby and mrt by the doorstep. And it's brand new!!!! 
 

2) profit ? HDB is at risk of policy changes. If you looking at profit from HDB, you just need to be aware of that. If 1 day, government say cannot sell to PR, or cannot rent out.. HDB may or may not maintain the current price. That one no one can tell you. You will probably be better off getting a EC or a PC if you hope for profiteering. 
 

If you dun have enuff for a EC or PC, i think you just stick to getting the GM if you can afford it.

Doesn't matter EC or not. 
 

As long as you exercise the OTP for your next property before selling your current one, then the ABSD applies. But you can apply to have it refunded  once you sell your existing place. If you wanna avoid paying the ABSD, then you have to sell your current place first before getting the next. But this could prove to be a problem for those projects which are still in construction.
 

The only concession is that the buyer of EC is not subjected to the stricter LTV requirements.
 

Details can be seen below in the press release from MAS.

Haha brother!  Let the bank account/wallet do the talking!
 

Ok l say my short piece then I leave:
 

After investing in the property market for almost a decade (still NOTHING compared to the lao jiaos who have been buying and selling for 50 years), I have concluded that ALL the professional property analysts and experts on this subject, no matter how many qualifications or how glowing their CVs are, are just talking cork half of the time and are just making a living publishing their nonsense.  They are what we called in the army, "Tan Jiak" one.
 

The fact is NOBODY can accurately predict which direction it will go and how long, and we can only make educated guesses based on the information we have got.  Whoever has the more useful information and interpretes it the best way, wins.  And then you have market sentiment, the wildcard that renders the best and most logical analyses useless.
 

But take note that even certain big global property investment funds also lost big on Singapore property, as well as Asian property in general.  And they have access to the best and fastest information.  So we think we are the farking experts here on this forum?

I've worked for both small and large property funds in the past. And we didn't have the best and latest info. No one does. No firm can collate such info in real time, real estate is a very complicated sector with too many sub-markets & factors to analyze.
 

I agree all "experts" are tan jiak (or at least 99% of them). Those in property investment who made money by "timing the market" and claim that they can do it all the time is BS. Only the hardcore real estate ppl who can work a lousy piece of real estate into something of value are the ones who can grind out good returns year in year out.
 

I had my fair share of luck by blindly entering the mkt at the "right" time and made close to a billion for my company. Our investors all thought we were genius. Then after that, i also lost several millions when mkt turned south. 
 

cooling measures are wayang. Too many factors beyond the govt's control. And those that are within their control, they only choose to implement half past six measures. But can't blame them, real estate is large source of income for country and also cannot anyhow offend the developers.

Cash is king.must always keep some. Then can invest the rest in stocks, property etc. The way I see it now, buyers won't buy unless owner giv 7% discount. So we will c whether owner desperate to sell. Usually wen lose job or cannot rent, they will b desperate.

But take note that even certain big global property investment funds also lost big on Singapore property, as well as Asian property in general.  And they have access to the best and fastest information.  So we think we are the farking experts here on this forum?
 

Just take everything with a pinch of salt.



 

the same applies to any other investment vehicle
 

in the end, everything is down to luck
 

random walk...anyone?

"And those that are within their control, they only choose to implement half past six measures." 
 

could you elaborate more about this ? thanks



 

ignoring global factors (QE1,2,3, low int rates, flight to quality etc), one of the major driver for SG residential is the lack of supply. That's 99% govt's fault as they control 90% of SG's land (but that's another story for another day).
 

Instead of implementing weak measures like stamp duty, releasing more GLS sites, etc, (which just contribute more to the coffers), they should prevent a runaway in prices of HDB resale which was exploding due to the supply issue.
 

In short, BTOs should be priced at a much lower price as what they have done in the past. This will incentivise couples to wait for BTOs instead of fighting it out for a resale unit and thus pushing up the COV and subsequently the price very quickly.
 

when resale HDB prices are curbed, there will be less demand for entry level private housing and those silly mickey mouse units. This will then lead to a cooling of the private housing mkt.
 

That;s my opinion. I may be off the mark.
 

But of course, other measures like ownership restrictions rules does help a little in the sense that it will not make the bubble bigger but they dun deflate it (if it's even possible).

Just my views on properties in Singapore,

Public housing in Singapore are extremely well build and planned for. I think everybody have to give HDB credit for that. The very fact that it is so well build and planned even PRs are dying to buy them. I had stay at several asian countries before and also in the uk during my uni times. Their lowest level of housing is unacceptable by singapore standards. Just look at our new flats and the environment surrounding it. It is clean, bright and well equiped. 
 

SCV points, Telephone lines, water & gas supply, daily clearing of rubblish, Monthly maintainance of public space like washing of common areas and mulit - storey carparks, efficency of town councils...... .
 

So my questions is why the hell would some people pay double for a condo in singapore??? If it is in China or south east asia i would understand, maybe because the difference is too much between public and private housing. But in Singapore except for the security guard, the pool and walls surrounding the condo. i really dont see that much difference in the flats itself.
 

My place in the most ulu part of north east singapore can be bought for abot 550k-600k but the same size unit with balconey cost 1mil++ to purchase.

400k-500k more for pools & securities? All the c--k and bull developers, agents and some wifes trying to drill into our brain. I would not want to swim in some pools where i can just stand and the water is at my tummy or some funny atas shaped pools where i swim 30 meters than have to u-turn. If i want to swim the pool must be at least 2.5 meters and have to be olympic size.
 

Then again about security, I have been parking my car,van and bike at my HDB carpark, not once it had been broken into or vandalise for the past 11 years. My unit is at the second floor, my windows don't have grilles and my windows are opened all the time including sleeping time for the past 11 yrs. 

Nothing happened so far, me and my wife are still breathing, we had not been murdered or raped. 
 

So why the hell people buy condos if they are not super rich and even worst some save and spend so little to be a happier person just to buy a condo when a HDB is enough?
 

It all boils down to pressures from the Government, developer, agents, peers and sometimes unreasonable other halves. Upgrade is the word they always use.

I've worked for both small and large property funds in the past. And we didn't have the best and latest info. No one does. No firm can collate such info in real time, real estate is a very complicated sector with too many sub-markets & factors to analyze.
 

I agree all "experts" are tan jiak (or at least 99% of them). Those in property investment who made money by "timing the market" and claim that they can do it all the time is BS. Only the hardcore real estate ppl who can work a lousy piece of real estate into something of value are the ones who can grind out good returns year in year out.
 

I had my fair share of luck by blindly entering the mkt at the "right" time and made close to a billion for my company. Our investors all thought we were genius. Then after that, i also lost several millions when mkt turned south. 
 

cooling measures are wayang. Too many factors beyond the govt's control. And those that are within their control, they only choose to implement half past six measures. But can't blame them, real estate is large source of income for country and also cannot anyhow offend the developers.



 
 

wow you made a billion for your company?

they must pay you at least $10mil for that.

Well done.

imo, the cooling measures won't work or rather, it makes things worse for the majority of Sporeans. Here's why.
 

1. Ban on PR sublet

This is such a typical policy. Blame the PRs. Yea right, there are so many PRs subletting and therefore, so many flats are locked in rental, creating a resale supply issue. My logic tells me there should be way more Sporeans subletting HDBs than PRs. Of course, are there stats to show the number of PRs subletting compared to Sporeans? 
 

2. Still no policy on COV. 

Give me a break. Govt want to cool prices and quell speculation. One of the most amazing things about public housing is there's no check on how much cash an owner can ask for and a buyer who's willing to pay. If a HDB owner asks for 100k COV and the buyer is willing, it will be 100k, 200k and so on. Cool prices and there's no cap on COV or removal of COV altogether??? Ironically, private market functions better with no COV and reflects market sentiment better. With COV, HDB will always be a cash cow.
 

3. No cake for the middle class

Add on ABSD only lets the rich party more and locking the middle class out of enjoying dual property ownership. Better still, govt earns more stamp duties now. 
 

On your points, what makes HDB prices skyrocket is not a supply issue. It's COV. Have u not read the papers of 200k COVs? Was it due to a supply issue? govt is always like that. Things somehow tend to look so good until we all know what it really means.



 

i kind of agree with you there are still many flaws with the new cooling measures and they looked to me increasingly like vote-buying measures by hitting hard on the pr.  actually the subletting thingy confirmed more singaporeans doing so than the pr.  but they don't want to risk upsettign singaporeans especially with punggole BE around the corner.
 

by going soft on HDB property and particularly citizens with HDB property, this cooling meausure will only divert buyers from private to HDB and also drive up rental demand, tbereby still benefitting  the citizens but may yet add to the increase in HDB resale prices again.

Haha, he's also salaried employee, just that he gets a promote for making beyond the target return.
 

So why would he give out ang pows? He already not bad, give us bonus and increments (at company's expense of course).
 

BTW, Invested most of his $10m. Saved some to buy a new car, new house, reno and some gadgets.

Cash is king.must always keep some. Then can invest the rest in stocks, property etc. The way I see it now, buyers won't buy unless owner giv 7% discount. So we will c whether owner desperate to sell. Usually wen lose job or cannot rent, they will b desperate.



 

The thing is, with our inflation, your $1m cash in bank 3 years ago is roughly worth $850k (very rough estimates, inflation 5% yearly for past 3 years). I know that with high property costs, rental yield is low and there are alternatives available (property stocks for one). But even after you sell your apartment, where are you going to park your cash? 
 

With the cooling measures, it is becoming difficult to own a second property. If you sell your second property today, you might not be able to afford one in the future without having to pay all the ABSD etc. In Singapore, for now, both unemployment and interest rates are low, so there are little incentives to sell.
 

Anyway, that's just my 2cents. The market is so complex and there are so many factors, and that is before we consider China/Asia's property markets, USD $40b QE3 etc etc. Personally I feel these measures target the middle classes who are trying to escape the rat race with passive income + potential capital gains. So those affected, time to buck up and work harder

Actually with 1m in cash, if you still have a postive outlook, just look for a 2m apartment lor..

50% down, ok what. If your monthly family income is at least 20K, i feel this trade is ok. 

IF you have a positive outlook or just buying a place to stay. 
 

Nothing exotic, but still got things within reach.

precisely - capital appreciation is a function of rental income.  the dumb scholars can't even get such simple concept beyond their thick brains.  their cooling measures so far looks like disconcerted fire fighting that cancels out each other.  when the focus is on hdb, the flame is fanned towards private.  when the focus is on private, the flame is fanned in the direction of HDB.
 

when hdb price high, whack hdb demand.  when pte price high, whack private demand.  they fail to see the connected demands for these 2 and neither do they see the connections of rental income to price of property.

kind of agree with u. it's the high resale which makes first timers consider private. after all, 50k cov might as well pay 1% for pte. smaller space but nowadays couple don't have kids so they don't care.

u can't really blame the developers and agents. They are businessmen and they will of course promote their products, just like how an Apple salesman will sell to u what is essentially premium when the functions are the same.
 

Our ministers earn a lot of money and are very rich. so the public will likewise follow such examples, at least 60% will more or less. 
 

I'll not comment on preference for swimming pool and stuff. to each his own. a rolex or a casio, it's entirely up to u. part of the reason ppl splurge on homes is the payment is through cpf, which cannot be touched except the ones who invest using it and is known to lose money. so many folks don't feel the stress of home ownership. Investment is a different matter cos use cash. so those who invest with little downpayment have more reason to be worried.

Both with the same logic , why are ppl spending so much to $$ to renovate their home, when they just need a simple fitting. 
 

Man shld be aspired to be better. and sometimes.. symbolical better..

If you dun move forward, you will be left behind...not only you but you and your family...

i kind of agree with you there are still many flaws with the new cooling measures and they looked to me increasingly like vote-buying measures by hitting hard on the pr.  actually the subletting thingy confirmed more singaporeans doing so than the pr.  but they don't want to risk upsettign singaporeans especially with punggole BE around the corner.
 

by going soft on HDB property and particularly citizens with HDB property, this cooling meausure will only divert buyers from private to HDB and also drive up rental demand, tbereby still benefitting  the citizens but may yet add to the increase in HDB resale prices again.



 

when one gap closes, another one opens. As for punggol, there may be those who have already finished paying their hdb and were looking to buy pte and rent out their hdb for solid rental yield. that dream may now harder to realise. so in a sense, it may backfire cos it's punggol.

So if one has private properties but i have yet to get a hdb coz not 35 yet how? I cannot buy hdb even if i quit my job and post zero income but i have cash to pay in full? How?

government say want to open up to PR to work here yet they whack PR hard on this one.  first pte property also kena stamp duty so they are forcing PR towards hdb.  then hdb prices go up later citizens blame pr again?  but it is citizens hoarding lion share of pte and renting it out while buying their pte property.  why whack the pr for transgressions of the citizens?

only way is to sell off pte or take your name out of pte. if the pte is shared with spouse or partner, the partner will have to buy over your share. once your name is out, you're clear to buy resale. wait 30 months, yr clear to apply bto provided you and spouse let go pte 30 mths earlier.

iskandar properties are not dirt cheap too, but cheaper. i checked out one apartment near the harbour is about 400k sgd, size about 1200sft. still alright but it used to be cheaper. i can totally understand y peter is investing there. 
 

something tells me the cooling measure is about politics. timing too precise. if it's GE, WP hard to get Aljunied. but since it's punggol, it may work against miw.

no la, i mean generally there's always complain about rising HDB prices and the policymaker makes the convenient move of targeting PR.  but they want to open up to PR to work here as well.  so are they pushing them to rent or buy HDB?
 

if they buy hdb, people will complain they drive up hdb prices.  if they rent, short term effect on ppty price is nto visible but long term you are sure more citizens will hog on to hdb flat and don't sell.
 

so the way the policy is shaped has effect of making things go one round of full cycle.

Hmm , guess i think i am stuck to my parents for the moment. Anyway for pte , i don't think i will be selling anytime soon , all on lease for 1+ years. I guess , 30 months is a long wait.

Scramble to beat the clock
 

Published on Jan 12, 2013
 
 

BUYERS rushed to showflats that either opened early or kept running late into the night to allow people to beat the deadline for new cooling measures that kicked in at midnight.
 

The hottest ticket in town seemed to be the showflat of La Fiesta, a development that was not due to launch until Tuesday.
 

Hundreds of potential buyers - and jostling agents - flocked to the flat in Sengkang last night, queuing to get inside to beat the midnight deadline.
 

Sales manager Julia Lee was spotted outside the showflat discussing her options with her husband, while her agent was queuing for them to get in.
 

The couple are looking at buying a second property for investment.
 

There were also many agents on the phone talking about potential price appreciation, appearing to convince more clients to come down while groups of people stood around outside, apparently trying to make a decision.
 

Other developers, including Far East Organization and MCC Land, kept their showflats open till late while agents tried to convince prospective buyers to close deals.

Discounts draw the crowds at Tampines showroom
 

Published on Jan 14, 2013
 
 

THE latest round of cooling measures did little to dampen the spirits of buyers at Q Bay Residences at Tampines, who were lured by attractive discounts on offer.
 

Although it is slated to launch only this Saturday, hundreds of people turned up yesterday at the showroom for the 630-unit project, which is a joint venture by Frasers Centrepoint, Far East Organization and Sekisui House.
 

Engineer Marcus Chin, 29, said he decided to drop by after a message from his agent promised a 22 per cent discount as part of a "pre-launch offer and stamp duty discount".
 

"It is quite a boon to get a discount, particularly if the latest measures don't affect me much," said the would-be first-time buyer.
 

Last Friday, the Government moved to curb speculation and foreign investor demand in a wide swathe of measures, but left first-timers largely untouched.
 

A spokesman for Frasers Centrepoint said it received more than 300 registrations of interest.
 

It was previously reported that agents quoted prices for the units at around $1,050 per sq ft, but some told The Straits Times yesterday on condition of anonymity that they could be priced even lower.
 

Those looking to invest, like human resource director Jessie Quah, were rather resigned.
 

She has to stump up 25 per cent in cash, up from 10 per cent previously, is restricted to borrowing less, and has to pay a 7 per cent additional buyer's stamp duty.
 

"I'm scaling down my expectations. Hopefully I can snag a decent place that I can rent out to supplement my retirement income in future," said the 51-year-old.
 

But Bangladesh national Shehabul Alam was undeterred. The orthopaedic surgeon was looking at a 517 sq ft one-bedroom unit for investment.
 

The additional stamp duty he pays for a second property has gone up from 10 to 15 per cent.
 

"Singapore is safe, has good laws and a stable economy. I believe my investment would be able to see some returns," he said.

Actually with 1m in cash, if you still have a postive outlook, just look for a 2m apartment lor..

50% down, ok what. If your monthly family income is at least 20K, i feel this trade is ok. 

IF you have a positive outlook or just buying a place to stay. 
 

Nothing exotic, but still got things within reach.




if monthly income about 5k, can purchased 2m property with 50% dp?

wat is scary is how reliant our economy is on property for growth:
 

Property cooling measures have a lot of teeth: DBS CEO
 

"He warned that as a result, the Singapore economy could grow at the lower end of its 1-3 per cent forecast for 2013."
 

but this shld b no surprise to anyone. Looking at past few quarters GDP #s, 1 of best performing sector is property, construction etc.... so garmen has been just watching this entire sector inflate for the past year until too many pple complain then come out w all the harsh measures... how desperate are they on property for growth? I believe if they did these measures 1 yr ago we wld confirm b in recession now.
 

N this is not even a global recession. If it is, i thk the whole mkt collapse since we cannot even take 5-7% price decline.

Johor to restrict foreign property buyers
 

In an effort to tackle rising housing costs in Johor, the state government will soon review the conditions and procedures for foreigners to own properties within the state, particularly in Iskandar Malaysia.
 

The State Economic Planning Unit (UPEN) is looking for ways to tighten rules on foreign ownership, said Housing, Arts, Culture & Heritage Committee Chairman Datuk Ahmad Zahri Jamil in a Bernama report. 
 

He noted that housing prices in the state are rising beyond the means of local residents.
 

"The price of property is determined by the market force. However, the prices also reflect on demand and supply or just because of extreme speculation. So, we have to conduct a detailed study.

Have always thought that for properties , its not about when you buy but WHEN YOU SELL ?? Who cares if the market drop 20 - 30 % or more , most to most , hold on to it la . Sooner or later , prices will recover . Just have to wait for it . 
 

Also been hearing people asking , what happens if you lose your jobs or whatever . If you are so unsure about your job status , then i think you need to take a good look at yourself again . Are you so redundant to your company or your trade / industry that if you were to lose your present job , you cannot find another job in your industry ?? If that is the case , then you seriously needs to work harder or smarter .
 

Opportunities do not drop from the sky !! You need to fight or work towards it !!

u r right and wrong also. if u got loads of spare cash, crisis time u can pay your instalment if no rental or lose job. companies like Far east hold hold hold properties, sars, 911, u name it they hold it but they can afford to hold. 
 

is this the case for many sporeans? in today's economy, no one can claim to be immune from retrenchment, except maybe our civil servants. we can just be more confident or less confident about it. 
 

so the idea is buy only when u can really afford it, a high dp and cash reserves of 2-3 years in times of zero rental.

Isn't that the way it should be  ?? You only buy things when you have money . Not enough money then work / save harder then buy .
 

Why are you so worried about today's economy and feeling so unsecure about your job if you are valuable to your company ? If you have always been performing and is able to add vaule to your company or your trade , so what if you are retrenched ?? You will be able to find another good job with similar salary if you are good . If you are just cruising along in your company , then even when the economy is booming , you will be made redundant in any company sooner or later .     
 

Of course i am not as rich or well off as forumers here who owns many properties or only buy cars in cash or whatsoever , i feel that i have done not too badly in life even though i do not have much paper qualification ( not even O levels ) .

Johor may double floor price for foreign buyers 

Minimum price may be raised to RM1 million in bid to cool property prices, says official
 
 

IN A BID to rein in prices because of the growing interest in Iskandar Malaysia, Johor is mulling a doubling of the floor price for properties bought by foreigners in the state to RM1 million (S$404,240) from RM500,000 at present. If implemented, Singaporeans as the largest group of foreign buyers would be the most affected by the tightening of such guidelines.
 

Local government, housing, arts, culture and heritage committee chairman Ahmad Zahri Jamil revealed that the state economic planning unit is looking into the matter and would make a decision on the matter later this year.
 

"We are concerned about the spiralling house prices in the state, especially in Iskandar Malaysia," the Star daily yesterday reported Mr Ahmad as saying. "One waterfront project with 500 units was fully taken up with just 30 per cent of the project completed," he observed.
 

If Johor opts to raise the price floor, it would be the second state after Penang to do so. Last year, the Penang state government increased the threshold to RM1 million for apartments on the island acquired by foreigners, and double that amount for landed property.
 

However a property consultant does not think such a move would aid local purchasers. On the contrary he believes it could result in a "pull-up effect" for Malaysian buyers.
 

KGV-Lambert Smith Hampton (Johor) executive director Samuel Tan said foreigners keen on Iskandar would not be deterred, especially since their currencies tend to be far stronger than the ringgit. Also, Malaysian real estate is still considerably cheaper than Singapore's.
 

Moreover, he thinks developers will just adjust prices upwards to meet the criteria. "If I am selling a semi-D at RM700,000 I will just increase the price to RM1 million."
 

Instead, he suggests a two-tier taxation system, foreigners paying more through higher real property gains tax or stamp duties.
 

Now that it is closer to a tipping point, foreign interest in Johor and Iskandar in particular is definitely on the rise. At the same time, measures by Singapore to cool its market have also pushed some of its citizens and expatriates to consider Malaysia's southern-most state.
 

In the past year, property prices in Johor have seen a noticeable surge. For example, new service apartments were priced at about RM400 psf two years ago, but more recent launches retail at RM900 to over RM1,000 psf.
 

A lot of the foreign interest is in greenfield areas such as Nusajaya and Medini - both precincts do not have a quota restriction on foreign buyers of a development whereas a 30 per cent limit applies in other parts of the state.
 

According to Mr Tan, Singaporeans easily make up half the buyers in some recent service apartment launches. "Some developers are even launching in Singapore before Malaysia although I think it should be the reverse," he observed.
 

Brownfield areas including Tebrau are also in demand, especially among Singaporeans already familiar with the surrounding infrastructure.

the thing is many are buying on minimum dp (20% and 30 year loans), without much cash in the bank after doing so. i believe in mortgage working for u but there's a limit and some fundamentals to follow too.

think the hike in iskandar will spill to other parts of johor too eventually. 
 

iskandar is actually quite ex now, still not too late to go in but i think soon, it won't be too attractive anymore. for those who want to retire in johor, it's especially impt to buy a home there.

true if aim retirement, JB is best. near to sg and relatives. anytime can go back sg.
 

so its more feasible for us now to buy iskandar property than in sg?




imo, no brainer. 
 

for sg, it's not just that the price is high. but with the cooling measures, the price won't go up. so u r buying at a pretty high chance of it falling. im not saying it will fall all the time but there are just too many reasons not to go into SG property unless one is full of money. 
 

the middle class sporeans shd consider iskandar. one mid size apartment or landed can be around 400k - 600k sgd. Don't expect the price to rise immediately cos Johor is full of land. but at least, u don't have to break the bank to buy it. 
 

personally, im more in kl. i still believe in cramp cities. but as im not retiring in jb, iskandar is not my goal. best part msia can defer payment till top. 
 

also note msia property tax is very high. think it's 30%. as long as not looking for a quick buck, msia seems pretty good.

My Personal take on 7th Property cooling measures...
 

It kills many Singaporean chances of owning a 2nd property and prices will stay flat unlikely fall!! YES will not fall much til 2015 and depend on Ben Bernake. of course my personal take can be BS and wrong.
 

Now all Singapore only got 1 free chance to own a property and better dun joint name with spouse or family members.
 

1) for people with 2, 3 or more property, before you sell remember the reinvestment risk you inheirt! 7% or 10% plus downpayment 50% or 60% depend the number of property you own. 
 

Thus translate in order for me to sell my 2nd or 3rd property, I need to sell you 1st time owner HIGHER!! to cover my reinvestment risk! As long as interest rate is low most property owner will hold and rent out cause no change in thier monthly repayment. population still increase, supply demand in a small island
 

remember prior to 2012 many people downpayment is own 20% for 2nd property and loan 80% Leverage   this are smart people having good debt!
 

now if I sell my 2nd property, not only I need to pay 7% extra but also down payment 50% thus total outlay 57%!! you siao arh??
 
 

2) lets compare SG vs HK since both cities/country demo closes. 26 Oct 2012 HK already increase property tax on foreigner "targeting Chinese National" and company 15% same as Singapore now, any impact on HK property prices??? FLAT didnt really drop and HK have a record transaction PSF last 3 mth.
 

HK 30% government housing 70% private vs Singapore 80% HDB 20% private! density per kilometer SQ SG more dense! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sover...ulation_density

with a higher HDB population, mean SG property market should be more stable than HK as HDB mean shelter (by right), yet HK orice didnt really fall....
 

3) All 7 cooling measures policy    and no owners will wish to see their property devalue (old vs young)   , what should be done is HDB!! HDB mission is to build affordable housing for SG citizen, but I feel HDB lost thier vision since 10  years ago after HDB got stuck with 30,000 HDB in late ninties early 2000 and come out with some Asset enhancement policy make Singaporean richer with HDB. to me only enhance private property owner who own 2 or more properties.
 

During GE 2011 people ask why is HDB so expensive?? "HDB pegged to land price thus the cost to bulid HDB increase" HDB do not profit.
 

Let take a look at Pinnacles @ Duxton as an example since this is the best of the best HDB. 1st balloting cause $350k to $451k depend on size and floor level. (thus this should mean the range $350k to $451k will cover the cost)
 

then why (left over due to race ratio 1st batch only appro. 91%to 92%  taken up, 5 years too long people give up etc) 2nd balloting units at $500k to $650k and last year remaining unsold 20+ units goes for 700k+??? don't $400k++ cover cost liao?? should flat release to 1st time owner price stay?? instead of moving inline with market? 
 

because of HDB release at such high price, what signal it send to market?? resales at Everton, Queentown and Tiong Bahru start to sell at $1mm!!!!
 

Private property see liao, if HDB sell $1mm why must I sell $1mm?? I will sell $1.5mm or more!!
 

Thus if HDB release brand new HDB at such high price, private property unlikely drop much....
 

Again let me stress this can be a full load of BS dun quote me

u r right and wrong also. if u got loads of spare cash, crisis time u can pay your instalment if no rental or lose job. companies like Far east hold hold hold properties, sars, 911, u name it they hold it but they can afford to hold. 
 

is this the case for many sporeans? in today's economy, no one can claim to be immune from retrenchment, except maybe our civil servants. we can just be more confident or less confident about it. 
 

so the idea is buy only when u can really afford it, a high dp and cash reserves of 2-3 years in times of zero rental.



 

I agree with Hubwee, your attitude is your altitude which many pple just complain (negative kill)  but dun see things positively and work smarter than harder or self reflection for improvement.

u make some valid points but it's also important to note once economy goes bad, ppl start losing jobs, FT go home as economy in their lands pick up, those stuck with huge home loans will suffer. one thing leads to another and home prices will start falling. 
 

A property expert said recently many Sporeans will be burnt by purchasing mass market condos, herd mentality.

last time maybe but nowadays, the developers are solid. Setia is one of them. Setia builds some of our condos here too. 
 

i really cant rem the property tax except it's not cheap. 
 

just to give u an indication. the developers for iskandar bought the land i heard at very low psf. they are making fat profits so they won't short change the consumers.

but before all this dissappear (depend on the cries of Singaporean), why would I be in a hurry to sell or why should I sell down my property?? cause there won't be much changes to my installment as long as interests rate dun shoot up, that say till 2015 depend on USA ben as I have mention. why would I want to take reinvestment risk cause dunno when?? why won't I wait? 
 

cause there is a need for every generation to own properties and population still increasing as mention by our minister no stopping yet.........
 

again I can be BS   just my view

government say want to open up to PR to work here yet they whack PR hard on this one.  first pte property also kena stamp duty so they are forcing PR towards hdb.  then hdb prices go up later citizens blame pr again?  but it is citizens hoarding lion share of pte and renting it out while buying their pte property.  why whack the pr for transgressions of the citizens?



 

SC like to make FT the scapegoat. COE high their fault, property high also their fault.

quality is one thing, the biggest RISK is the future plan is not executed

a lot of the selling points for JB properties including iskandar is the next phase and the next phase how great it "will be"

if the next phase is not happening or fall short of expectation, the price that you paid is already priced in
 

i went to JB last week and happen to see a big banner of JB WATERFRONT CITY ...

artist impression for the plan was sibei tok kong ... sibei powderful

in reality it is a rusted banner with poles now

Have always thought that for properties , its not about when you buy but WHEN YOU SELL ?? Who cares if the market drop 20 - 30 % or more , most to most , hold on to it la . Sooner or later , prices will recover . Just have to wait for it . 
 

Also been hearing people asking , what happens if you lose your jobs or whatever . If you are so unsure about your job status , then i think you need to take a good look at yourself again . Are you so redundant to your company or your trade / industry that if you were to lose your present job , you cannot find another job in your industry ?? If that is the case , then you seriously needs to work harder or smarter .
 

Opportunities do not drop from the sky !! You need to fight or work towards it !! 
 

my 2 cents ....



 

It's true if it the property is for your own occupation. But if it's for investment, most ppl will sell at a loss to cut loss. Sell at 20% loss but maybe can buy back at another 20% discount if mkt worsen right?
 

As for jobs when there is a massive retrenchment, it doesnt matter how well u perform, everyone is fair game. In my previous company, i've seen them firing the better employee and retaining the lousier one. For reasons other than work ability.
 

Only safe employment is self-employment (or civil service).

Yes, most ppl will be able to hold on and continuing servicing their condos. But just a 20% who can't will mean 6,000 households will suffer (assuming 30,000 condos were sold in the last 2 yrs at the crazy prices)

but, the local private property market need "upgraders" ... upgraders = sell hdb ... so must sell sky high in order to buy $2M Sky Habitat
 

first timer and upgrader ... one want to buy low, one want to sell high ... problem

if new hdb and bto supply is sufficient and new PR drop ... upgrader also cannot sell their hdb sky high ... if they cannot sell sky high ... they cannot afford $2M Sky Habitat

everyone is in the food chain ... see who eat who only

Yay... although so far those that had invested in JB has been reaping profit.. i just worry that of high % of SG investment.. if MY government siao siao again.. say $$ invested in MY cannot be taken out, just like the asian crisis , when all the $$ in stock are frozen.. then our $$ will vaporise overnight. 

MY has not been very retail-investor friendly. Remember, we play a different game from the big boys.. they buy buildings to rent out as hotels/hospital/commerical activities.
 

I would rather go for AU/EU/US.. for the matter of discussion, i rather buy Shanghai.

thats y all investments have their risk. the question is can u absorb that risk? as JB properties are cheap, it's possible for most Sporeans to go there. lose, they can swallow. no one can be 100% sure but the risk are minimised if u go for projects which are build by reputable developers. 
 

Let's take Raffles as an example. He saw what ppl did not see. SG was only a fishing village but he saw location, good harbor etc. Nearer to home, City Square in Kitchener Rd, being near Mustafa, ppl used to laugh at those who bought there. The value has gone up almost 300% since TOP. 
 

Im not saying SG cannot buy property. But the cash needed is very high, with or without the cooling measures, plus added risks too like shoebox units. That's y Peter is crossing over too. He doesn't need to as he's super rich. But u know when Peter eyes something, it's worth a 2nd look.

Im not saying SG cannot buy property. But the cash needed is very high, with or without the cooling measures, plus added risks too like shoebox units. That's y Peter is crossing over too. He doesn't need to as he's super rich. But u know when Peter eyes something, it's worth a 2nd look.



 

Actually JB is very very high risk, if Sultan of Johor go crazy, he may just call for a stop to all development in Iskandan. Look at Malacca.. last time so powerful..everyone there is moving out to the bigger city to work.

At the end of the day, Malaysia so big.. they can afford to abandon the projects even with excellent location etc. 
 

Raffles dun have malacca. Malacca is control by the dutch...

400K-600K SGD is way too expansive at JB's standard. You can a freehold double storey terrace house at location much closer to town at SGD100K

Iskandar is just an ulu and over hyped place.

my relatives in KL everytime i talk to them, it seems crime is getting worse there. Apparently many selling their landed prop there coz too many robbery n burglary. Now if wanna buy in MY, must b gated community at least. Even gated projects arent 100% theft proof.
 

I have relatives in PJ n KL, is really bad there, some robbers blatantly bang main door down n polis nowhere to b seen. So only condoes or gated, no detached landed unless u hire private guards... Some robbers will even boast that they have robbed many houses n nothing stopping them
 

Also the upcoming GE2013 is v key, if opposition pakatan win, turmoil liao.,.. garmen changes are big n dramatic events.

high risk, high returns. thats the name of the game in investment. if u don't want risk, put money in the bank. 
 

SG was controlled in a silent way by the Dutch too. The British managed to strike a deal with them to take SG.

for the first time, i agree with you...

Look there is someone trying to sell a house in the forum.. lelong very long also no takers...

Maybe his prices is not attractive , maybe he is not aggressive to sell..but the end of the story is.. it only count as profit until you realised it.

So what if psf for the area rose by x%.. until you find the buyer that is willing to pay.. then it's consider profit.

Yes, most ppl will be able to hold on and continuing servicing their condos. But just a 20% who can't will mean 6,000 households will suffer (assuming 30,000 condos were sold in the last 2 yrs at the crazy prices)



 

To this 20% figure, add another 20% of buyers who are priced out of market. 

Supply increase 20%, demand decrease 20%. 
 

In the very long term(>20 years) , as long as you are confident about Singapore, buying property should not be an issue. 

Buying with that view, on 50% d/p. I think we are safe. 

But in the short term(<5 years)?

Not so confident.

depends how you see it
 

if you take a high loan that you may not be able to afford if there is a downturn or rental falls or i/r increase, etc then it is possible you may lose everything even though property value is not $0
 

i doubt you can say a person that put 50% dp is looking at high risk high gain... people looking at high risk high gain is looking to purchase as many properties as possible with a certain amount of money, i.e as much leverage as possible

Why not ? Some people loan beyond means. Under circumstances, you are forced to sell below cost or take over by the bank, and the bank will not be so kind to refund your interests of course. It's not yours unless it's fully paid up. The property won't be sold for $0, but you won't get to keep the property or the money. To you, you have $0, and it still cost you interests.

Today's properties are so artificially inflated. Same goes to our COE prices. This is a real concern for those to buy properties at this price. I believe many did not take into downside situations. It have been so emotional and blind by the fact that, geman will continue to support inflated prices. When comes to global events, that is so much the german can do. The rest, one just have to ensure ones finance. You can sell a car easily, when times are so bad. But you cannot just liquidate your property over night at right price, when you are caught in a bad situation.

I sold my local one in late 201, knowing the yields of local properties are so depressed. While still holding the Malaysia property, that yielded 13% to-date. For course, if you are buying into Malaysia now, the price is just as inflated. But not as bad as compare to Singapore and Hong Kong.

The traditional problem with property investment has been that, because of its very nature, most people are putting all their eggs in one basket. 
 

The "average" investor, in reality can normally only afford to get a second house - if something goes bad with that house, then they are in serious problems.  Whether that bad thing be bad tenants, poor maintenance or something else. 
 

Of course, property is often the most popular investment as well because it is the least volatile.

And further, by its very nature, once property starts to fall, buyers tend to wait - not really the same for cars and other durables.

Is no longer a hedging factor. This same goes to those who bought into gold, few years back and thought it as a store-value. End up got burn, when the gold price came down last year. Of course, the market market boom may take longer then ones, predicts the fall, due many unsustainable factors. By the time one realize, this is what you had just mentioned.

yeah, but the value prescribed to a location changes over time.
 

Eg: Sail@marina launched cheaply as it was untested residential area. No one knew if there was a demand for 1,000 + units in CBD.

Citylights - centrally located but thought to be lousy location too

Punggol - thought to be dumping site of all BTOs. Super far from all places. But now it is the premiere waterfront town (whatever that means)

Bishan - cemetery and burial place. But now probably the most expensive HDB town in SG.

If the MC and condo manager (usually an outsourced employee of a building management company) are on-the-ball, fix and maintain everything as they should, age should not matter one bit.
 

I currently live in a 21 year old condo and everything, tennis courts, swimming pool, lobby, wall cladding, common toilets and showers, car parks, sewerage, leaks, paint weathering, electrical system of building, had been fixed as soon as problems cropped up and everything is currently in tip top condition.
 

So if the condo you view is in a really bad condition, somebody is not doing his job and it will be a condo to avoid.

Singles to be allowed to buy new HDB flats this year: Khaw
Posted: 14 January 2013 2217 hrs
 

SINGAPORE: The National Development Ministry (MND) aims to implement its policy of allowing singles to buy new Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats for owner-occupation this year, said its Minister Khaw Boon Wan on Monday.
 

In a written reply to a question in Parliament, Mr Khaw said MND is "finalising" its policy. Currently, singles cannot buy new flats from HDB by themselves. They can, however, buy a resale flat if they are at least 35 years old.
 

Over the past decade, 18,000 singles aged between 35 and 40 bought HDB resale flats. Of these, 3,800 singles - or 21 per cent - got married subsequently, said Mr Khaw.
 

In a separate parliamentary reply, Mr Khaw said the minimum age of 35 for singles to buy new flats "supports our promotion of marriage and parenthood".
 

"We will be revising our policies to allow singles to buy new HDB flats with certain restrictions. However, there are no plans to lower the minimum age, as marriage rates are highest between the ages of 25 and 34," he added.

Yea that is good advice.

The management of a property is just as important as the quality of tenancy and the standard of the physical building.

A poorly managed property is never be a good one

A good property is never poorly managed.

then at 36 chop chop get marry ... move in to private condo and these 2 units are treated as "lexus" studio for rental and purchased under "corolla" price

the best is all "single" units must sell back to hdb else it would be another tool to flip property or single units cannot be sublet ... must sell sell sell

someone ask, buy single unit at 35, then got married at 36 want to buy bigger flat ... mop 5 years for single unit? this mean 5 years cannot marry until 40? lolz

rich papa will buy 1 unit under son name (not married yet) & 1 unit under daughter (not married yet).

then at 36 chop chop get marry ... move in to private condo and these 2 units are treated as "lexus" studio for rental and purchased under "corolla" price

the best is all "single" units must sell back to hdb else it would be another tool to flip property or single units cannot be sublet ... must sell sell sell

someone ask, buy single unit at 35, then got married at 36 want to buy bigger flat ... mop 5 years for single unit? this mean 5 years cannot marry until 40? lolz



 

who say need to? just rent out lor

if anyone cannot believe that prices can drop 20%, then better not buy now. This isnt a bear mkt n we r nowhere near the bottom so chances of falling is higher than not. Want to confirm minimum downside then wait for a big recession then buy. Buy now better have extra cash ready in case.

Depends loh.
 

If the valuation of your place went up and after the fall of 20% is still more than your outstanding loan, then no call.

iskandar can be considered a higher risk side due to nothing really taking place there now. Peter Lim is going in as a developer so you can take the cue from there according to your ability. don't bite more than you can chew.

if someone is looking for alternative housing,  it should be fine 
 

if it's for investment, then it's hard to call I guess but with the relatively low prices when compared to sg,  it may jolly well be worth a gamble

In all investments whether is property or stocks, there is a life-cycle. Property life-cycle tend to be longer than many have thought. Whereas, stocks cycle are shorter. As long as one dun over leverage that's fine. If really a margin call for those bought high, that'e the concern. I believe most are buy on margin, as compare to stocks.

Of course not to that extend. This is just too extreme. This time turn is a different situation and is artificially created. Neither one should underestimate the new ruling. Normally a downturn of property market pattern is similar to a stock market, but the cycle of a property market could be as longer as 10 years before it turns. The start of downturn is normally gradual regress. When comes to middle of downtrend, the curve becomes sharper. That's where many will start rush for exit. 

As long, as one still has a job that fine. This actual feel may not within this year or next. It's takes a few years to feel the impact.

He also have a fair share of getting burn in a number of investments. So that shows, a long time investor can also get burnt. But in a control manner.

I would expect that the big danger is not margin calls, but rather failure to pay mortgage. 
 

Once the market starts to go bad, maybe interest rates go up, you can see the value of the house dropping day by day and want to get out.  But in a dropping market, who wants to buy?  So people get stuck. 
 

Add in that maybe tenancy demand goes down, or rent goes down, suddenly the cash flow to support the mortgage isn't there. 
 

Then further, as the development progresses, then you have to start paying more on the mortgage, where you may well have had enough cash to supplement for 3-4 years, or until TOP, suddenly the market is dropping, you still need to add cash to the mortgage but your reserves are depleted - then what?  You try to sell, and sell quickly because you don't have cash to support the higher mortgage, but how?  Market is dropping, no one wants to buy - so you drop price - and it just becomes a self reinforcing cycle.

i believe majority of local property "investor" especially upper-middle-class not the super rich type that buy sentosa cove, marina bay area or GCB falls under the below scenario

upgrader is not investor ... they just sell hdb and upgrade to condo and sign on for the next 25-30 years loan

price correction + interest rate rise = double whammy
 

property 1 = hdb = fully paid = sublet

property 2 = condo = live in = LTV = 80%

property 3 = condo (probably shoebox) = investment = LTV = 60%
 

property 0 = live with parent / in-law

property 1 = hdb = sublet (fully paid is best, else property 2&3 LTV will be lower)

property 2 = condo = investment = LTV = 80%

property 3 = condo = investment = LTV = 60%



 

Wah scary so much loans.

If lose the job, risk losing car losing house, losing face and eating grass
 

Actually its not too different from running a business.

The ones that continue to expand too quickly too soon on borrowed money cant go a long way.

They may get ahead first but if they are not wise enough to stop and think, confirm go down.

Slow and steady does finally win the game.

I learnt this since 2yrs old.

actually..the recently spike in the buying signal hoarding...

I think CM8 has to start addressing that ... 
 

Actually, government shld force the 4-5% vacant unit out into the mkt. Their policy shld be target on these units.

These are ready units...so it shld "soften" the tight housing mkt. 

They could either lower rental property tax or slap vacant owners with a big fine.
 

Also they shld mkt the buyers of new development to start to finance fully the unit when they pick up the unit. They have to service the intended borrowed amt. e.g. if you intent to buy a 1 mil unit, you start to pay 2000-3000 per mth after you acquire.. Then it will be a real test if you have the abilities to finance the loan when there is no rental. Also prevent hoarding...

CMs just prolong the bull mkt in a v slow way, IMO. If there was no CMs, the mkt wld have jumped 30-40% n crashed v hard by now, so instead of big price moves, which means good upside for timing investors, we have a slow n steady uptrend... boring n unattractive, which is exactly wat garmen wants to do, make property not attractive for investment anymore.

Not hard to predict - they will stab each other in the back, as soon as the market starts to slide, then buyers have more incentive to wait. So it depends on who has the biggest balls I guess.

Most of the flippers are infact property agents. They grab the units first and release the remaining to public. All thanks to them that artificially inflated the demand and prices. I believe oversupply already kicks in, and will be worsen over the next few years. If prices start sliding from now and over 10% over the next 12 mths, those flippers can kiss goodbye to their profit. Ho seh!

yeah.. the mkt is under gong tao liao.. everyone  think the mkt will not drop at all... just that not enuff $$ to pay the levy here and there... 
 

i dun think oversupply will kill the mkt or the interest rate..

It's when ppl realised that they put in 4k mthly... but return is only 3k  or worse cannot rent out.. then ppl will start to rush to exit.. then the big crash will come when everyone under gong tao again.. that the mkt will never pick up again.

interest rate low .. you still need to pay 3k for a 1.2 mil unit.. if you cannt rent out, effective you are bleeding.. 
 

its not a matter of yield....... if you bleeding 3k a mth, will you continue to hold? put in the bank, you dun see blood.. just inflation sucking you slowly..
 

Imagine, you earn 20k, every mth you lose 3k for "nothing" ... you will let go to realised your profit .. no matter what..

If the MC and condo manager (usually an outsourced employee of a building management company) are on-the-ball, fix and maintain everything as they should, age should not matter one bit.
 

I currently live in a 21 year old condo and everything, tennis courts, swimming pool, lobby, wall cladding, common toilets and showers, car parks, sewerage, leaks, paint weathering, electrical system of building, had been fixed as soon as problems cropped up and everything is currently in tip top condition.
 

So if the condo you view is in a really bad condition, somebody is not doing his job and it will be a condo to avoid.

Most of the flippers are infact property agents. They grab the units first and release the remaining to public. All thanks to them that artificially inflated the demand and prices. I believe oversupply already kicks in, and will be worsen over the next few years. If prices start sliding from now and over 10% over the next 12 mths, those flippers can kiss goodbye to their profit.



 

One of the more incisive and sincere comments i feel in such property threads.
 

The Kubler Ross model or the  5 emotional stages of grief are:

denial; anger; bargaining; depression; and, acceptance
 

The following graph was shown when they introduced CM6.


 

The policy makers do know something but didn't want to be too blunt.

interest rate low .. you still need to pay 3k for a 1.2 mil unit.. if you cannt rent out, effective you are bleeding.. 
 

its not a matter of yield....... if you bleeding 3k a mth, will you continue to hold? put in the bank, you dun see blood.. just inflation sucking you slowly..
 

Imagine, you earn 20k, every mth you lose 3k for "nothing" ... you will let go to realised your profit .. no matter what..



 

That scenario is unlikely for now. No takers at 3k then lower asking rent to 2.5k. Still no takers then i'm sure 2k will do the trick. Then only bleed $1k a mth, that's a small price to pay for expected 50% capital appreciation over the next 5 yrs. 
 

1.2m is probably 3-bedder suburban condo. A master leasee can rent it at 2k and lease out the other 2 rooms at $800 to $1,000 each. Nowadays HDB rooms are already asking for $600 - $800 depending on location. Demand is there.
 

If pocket not so deep then buy a shoebox at $800k. Monthly debt service prob under $2k. Easy to find tenants.

1.2m condo .. rent add up $3.5k... then no need to pay pty tax.. it's almost $200 a mth, then you have $300-400 maintance  + sinking fund, on top of that your rental is taxable! how abt agent fee and vacant period. .. you under gong tao liao.. 
 

So even if you rent out at $3.5k , you hardly cover your cost.
 
 

 IF everyone under gong tao to sell, believe no one will hold. Capital appreciate will only happen in the next cycle.

i just talking abt simple ROI.. you pay so much mortgage/fee/tax... and your expected income..
 

Once the ROI does not make sense.. some ppl will start to sell while it still look goods... other will follow... and then everyone will be selling.....
 

same now.. cos' ROI was good.. so some buy and make $$.. other follows.. then now everyone wants a rental income..

U forget that ppl dun consider CPF $$ as own $$. Use it to pay for bank loan not heartache at all... 
 

So if monthly debt service is $3k and can use $2k from CPF to pay, then cash outlay is only $1k a mth. Adding on all the maintenance, taxes etc prob about $2k. So rent out at $2k can cover liao right?  
 

nowadays cycles are only 5 yrs so very fast come one... dun worry. Moreover, Bernanke will continue to keep interest rates low for a loooooong time to come.

The current rental market is from 2.5 ~ 4.5 % yield. There are abundant professionals working in Jurong and CBD which till require a roof, personally in my company here there are already 100 of this so called FT or professional staying in some condo somewhere. So like what forumer Wyfitms said the rental may just dip a little to 2~3% yield when they can't find better paying tenant. 

Now for those rich man - earning between 2~3% yield in property or put your $ in Singapore blue chip company earning 4~5% yield but at the same time still losing capital gain due to inflation of 5%. 

The choice was obvious people will choose Property in the past. With this measure maybe it will cause a knee jerk. 
 

But something is still telling me that the 700 billions the Japanese government releasing to the market will still eventually come here as the safest market. 

Now where the money can go now ?

I would expect that the big danger is not margin calls, but rather failure to pay mortgage. 
 

Once the market starts to go bad, maybe interest rates go up, you can see the value of the house dropping day by day and want to get out.  But in a dropping market, who wants to buy?  So people get stuck. 
 

Add in that maybe tenancy demand goes down, or rent goes down, suddenly the cash flow to support the mortgage isn't there. 
 

Then further, as the development progresses, then you have to start paying more on the mortgage, where you may well have had enough cash to supplement for 3-4 years, or until TOP, suddenly the market is dropping, you still need to add cash to the mortgage but your reserves are depleted - then what?  You try to sell, and sell quickly because you don't have cash to support the higher mortgage, but how?  Market is dropping, no one wants to buy - so you drop price - and it just becomes a self reinforcing cycle.




When the market is dropping, if yr cash rich, pls buy.

Well , the moral of this whole thing is liquidity. It's a double-edged sword. It can inflate asset prices, it can also deflate asset prices. what we are facing now, is there is too much of liquidity, that will eventually create problems led to over investments. The way I see it, as a beginning of the overly supply of properties that will filter down to 1 - 3 years down the road. Could be painful.

I do not think you are familiar with how such sites and agents operate. 30% of the ads are duplicates , another 40% "fishing" ads where they pretend to have a unit for sale/rent and only 30% will be genuine ads. Give a few agts who advertise a call and you will figure out how they operate.

Let's assume smelly smelly 40% are genuine ads lah, that will still give a large number of sellers. Just assume if you are one of the seller, you will be competing with tens and hundreds of them on sale.

wun cool down. it'll crash the mkt.
 

Govt will be sad. Revenue all gone.



 

That's why it is called cooling measure and not crashing measure. Every step is calculated and timed swee swee to achieve a soft landing and not hard landing. But too bad market very stubborn and keep defying Newton's Law, tiam tiam kee.

Let's assume smelly smelly 40% are genuine ads lah, that will still give a large number of sellers. Just assume if you are one of the seller, you will be competing with tens and hundreds of them on sale.
 

Spottiswoode - 241 (96)

Centro Residences - 93 (37)

Estuary - 681 (272)

Scala - 241 (96)



 

i'd take only 1/2 or 1/3 of those numbers. not every seller gives exclusives so multiple agents advertise the exact same property, and ive noticed an interesting trend where agents advertise properties they arent supposed to, find the client, and then co-broke with the actual agent.

Not interested to test. Cos there is no reason for panic selling now, low interest rate plus good employment market are holding on the prices. But let's wait and see lah, let it slowly unfold.

The way mbt worded them in Jan 15, 2011 is still classic and it hinted how those scholars in mnd approach cm, i guess.

"calibrated", "targeted" and "pre-emptive".

U forget that ppl dun consider CPF $$ as own $$. Use it to pay for bank loan not heartache at all... 
 

So if monthly debt service is $3k and can use $2k from CPF to pay, then cash outlay is only $1k a mth. Adding on all the maintenance, taxes etc prob about $2k. So rent out at $2k can cover liao right?  
 

nowadays cycles are only 5 yrs so very fast come one... dun worry. Moreover, Bernanke will continue to keep interest rates low for a loooooong time to come.  




If ppl dont care about cpf money as their own, can they allow the government to lower the interest rate in cpf???
 

Bernanke is forced to tie with IMF,you are right that interest rate will not drop in near term because they want cheap money to flow to countries where the supdr rich want to go. Today Singapore, tomorrow other countries. Now we are enjoying because of strong alliance with the super rich. If ASEAN fallout, singapore will be doom, these rich f**k will leav, and singapore stock,properties will be stagnant like in japan.
 

Think about it in a macro view, is singapore really strong to last  that long.....i keep my money in a sfae place, certainly not in properties and stock here. There are many great whites out there to prey on the middle class.

OCR AND RCR hdb even all the way to sengkang, bishan, tampinese, tao payoh, amk, clementi, jurong east, etc

yeah.. the mkt is under gong tao liao.. everyone  think the mkt will not drop at all... just that not enuff $$ to pay the levy here and there... 
 

i dun think oversupply will kill the mkt or the interest rate..

It's when ppl realised that they put in 4k mthly... but return is only 3k  or worse cannot rent out.. then ppl will start to rush to exit.. then the big crash will come when everyone under gong tao again.. that the mkt will never pick up again. 
 

Just see london for example... interest rate never pick up, supply is  tight but still not many dare to buy...



 

The psychology of a bubble is such that when everyone thinks it will not drop not matter what.

Thats when it will actually crash. 
 

When people are not sure about the market, thats when it will go up.

Notice there are a lot of people still think price will hold, or even go up. 
 

However, i know of people with multiple units selling now, in very prime areas and already 10-20% lower than initial purchase price. 

3000psf now selling 2.4k-2.7k psf. 

However, the condition for that price is not to lodge caveats, so they can continue to dispose of their units at decent prices. 

The condition is written into the contracts. 
 

You think these guys are overextended that's why they sell? 

All i can say is, you are wrong. They are not overextended at all. Loan is only about 30-50%. 
 

To them, the going looks bad, cut now, lose a few million. 

Take the money look for some other investment, or business to buy. 

Better than money stuck for very looong time, no return and possibly a bigger paper loss. 
 

To these guys, property in Singapore is a view, a bet, an investment. Nothing more nothing less. 

I really hope its not indicative, and it is a few isolated cases, but i will be talking to a few more friends to find out. 

If its not isolated, then the hot money is coming out of property, and we all need to brace for impact.

prime rentals have already gone down. those who wana cut loss may be bought recently? cos if bought in 08-09, they made quite a bit. 
 

even before cooling measure, i thought property in SG not good to invest unless one holds a very long term outlook.

The current rental market is from 2.5 ~ 4.5 % yield. There are abundant professionals working in Jurong and CBD which till require a roof, personally in my company here there are already 100 of this so called FT or professional staying in some condo somewhere. So like what forumer Wyfitms said the rental may just dip a little to 2~3% yield when they can't find better paying tenant. 

Now for those rich man - earning between 2~3% yield in property or put your $ in Singapore blue chip company earning 4~5% yield but at the same time still losing capital gain due to inflation of 5%. 

The choice was obvious people will choose Property in the past. With this measure maybe it will cause a knee jerk. 
 

But something is still telling me that the 700 billions the Japanese government releasing to the market will still eventually come here as the safest market. 

Now where the money can go now ?  



 

if SG property?? buy those around liang court

looks like more properties being withdrawn more than anything else. i've been eyeing a few places for my own use (and this is my first place) and suddenly a lot of the agents said the owners have withdrawn from sale .. *sigh*
 

not sure if the measures are helping that much, since supply seems to be somewhat decreasing.



 

like I mention in my earlier posting... guess the same. As long as interests low, got job owner will stop selling this even 7th cooling measures prices unlike to dip much, more likely to stay flat.
 

as for economic crisis, no need cooling measures everything will crash not only property. 4/1/2 years ago already a good example.

if they want crash, which i refer to panic selling, all they need to do is increase interest rate to 4%. majority next day firesale cos rental cannot cover. 
 

but the fact they come up with so many pages here and there tells me they don't want a crash. looks like they are working really hard, very typical of civil service. can use highway but choose to drive through the streets to the same destination.

yup im aware. however thats a double edged sword. hypothetically, if the market continued on a down trend, some may be forced to sell low..
 

lol, anyway, pipe dream for 1st time buyers like me lah 



 

you dun own anything, my advise is just buy something you like for own stay dun really need to time the market cause small island huge population, 10 years cycle you should still be ok. always must have at least 1 property especially we a major chinese city long the market, cause when market run..... very fast can also no return. look at chinese around the world, 99% will wanna be land lord is in the culture unlike ang moh can be cool abt renting. many HKer made fortune from property too. just look at SG property evey 10 years cycle... wont really kill if u owner occup
 

I have colleague who sold their property in end 2010 think property too high will drop 15% to 20%..... since then till now? renting a place $5k per mth equal to $120k spend on rent liao...... if property stay flat or drop by a bit only double whammy    each month no property more $5k gone and all this would have gone to housing loan.
 

truth is also there are many chinese national still cant really speak English and not used to western life, thus choice of cities out of China is Singapore and Hong Kong...... and these pple got $$$ to throw

Yes they are afraid of bubble, so trying to stop the surge. If bubble burst they have to pick up the pieces. Most will look for MP.  
 

If it is because of CM7 and not due to economy, the property market crashes now.... Better still like some here say, people start jumping....  They have more troubles to pick up. Got so stupid meh.

so as i mentioned before in previous post, it prolongs the bull run at slower rate. Wat this does is instead of a natural boom bust cycle, it drags more n more pple into property, then when it really crashes due to another global crisis, alot more than expected are hurt. 
 

By right if no CMs, we wld have gone up super high and crashed hard by now, but all the CMs simply prevented, instead no crash but keep creeping up.
 

So lets say in 3-4yrs time another 3-4yrs of record sales, then comes the global crisis, guess how many affected? ALot! 
 

Well thats how things are, every economic cycle is same same but different

From the cross island line, any idea whether the construction will cut into the nature reserves (Bukit Timah to Sin Ming)?
 

That may be a big no no for environmental or (gasp!) fengshui reasons.
 

2030 is still quite a distant dream and changes/ technology may evolve along the way but still quite a daring proposal, nonetheless.

The prime segment (>3,000 psf) has been doing badly since 2008 until now. Super low volume compared to 2006-2007 where hundreds of units were sold. So not surprising that ppl are selling at loss.
 
 

What has done well and will continue to do well are the segment where total quantum is below $1.5m. This segment will continue to hold well and absolute while price will not go up much from here, area will shrink thus translating into higher psf price. All thanks to our wonder and brilliant MND who is pushing HDB prices towards new record high.
 

I think those with the ability to invest $10m or more in a single condo unit in SG would have more attractive investment choices outside of SG.

Can you don't lodged a caveat? Thought it's a must to lodge a caveat or at least that is what a reliable lawyer would do for you. Never heard of someone not lodging a caveat before, could you elaborate?

I'm a noob so if that ia true, does it mean we can't see their sales transactions and so the true picture of that development is not revealed?

yes, iirc you dont need to lodge caveat if you *really* trust the seller. 
 

i've seen a few deals go through before with no caveat lodged. (either that, or the caveat system was not updated correctly?)
 

edit: but i believe for new projects must always lodge caveat to prevent the scenario you are describing ...

Yes can don't lodge.

To your last question, yes. So open your eyes wide wide when doing a trade. 
 

Tha range of tricks in the market to gain an advantage is mind boggling. 

Moreover, this is completely legal. 

Caveat is a voluntary process.

SINGAPORE: Q Bay Residences at Tampines is the first private residential project to be launched since the latest round of property cooling measures kicked in last weekend. 
 

To attract buyers, the developer is offering discounts of up to 22 per cent. 
 

Market experts said Q Bay Residences will be a test of home buyers' appetite for new developments
 

The 630-unit project, which is a joint venture by Frasers Centrepoint, Far East Organization and Sekisui House. 
 

It will be launched at an average selling price of S$985 per square foot after all discounts this Saturday.
 

This is below the price of most other new suburban launches out in the market for more than S$1,000 per square foot. 
 

The developers of Q Bay Residences said about 550 to 600 buyers put in cheques for pre-booking but about 100 withdrew after the cooling measures were announced.
 

The developer said many are likely to be third and fourth-time property buyers but they are hoping that the project's location in Tampines will entice buyers. 
 

Q Bay Residences is the first private condominium project to be launched in Tampines in the last two years.
 

Cheang Kok Kheong, chief executive officer of development & property at Frasers Centrepoint Limited, said: "In Tampines, there has not been many condominiums over the last eight years. There is sort of a pent up demand, people that have been upgrading, have to move on to places like Woodlands and Punggol. But now, the people who own HDB flats are able to continue living in Tampines at Q Bay."
 

Meanwhile, analysts noted that developers should now be targeting first-time property buyers and pricing is key.
 

Chris Koh, director of Chris International, said: "It's good that they didn't cross the S$1,000 psf barrier mark, because if they do, it may scare many people off. By keeping it below S$1,000 psf, it looks more attractive.
 

"There's very little comparison because we don't have many developments in that area, but we also know of developments in suburban areas, 99 year leases, that sell at S$1,200 psf. On top of that, it's the discount that will make people bite. We're talking about a 15 per cent and an absorption of the Additional Buyer Stamp Duty up to seven per cent."
 

Experts said the Q Bay Residences project will be a test bed for the market. 
 

Developers are expected to continue with their launches if the sales volumes for the project is healthy.
 

Q Bay Residences is expected to be completed in May 2017.

From the cross island line, any idea whether the construction will cut into the nature reserves (Bukit Timah to Sin Ming)?
 

That may be a big no no for environmental or (gasp!) fengshui reasons.
 

2030 is still quite a distant dream and changes/ technology may evolve along the way but still quite a daring proposal, nonetheless.

SINGAPORE: Q Bay Residences at Tampines is the first private residential project to be launched since the latest round of property cooling measures kicked in last weekend. 
 

To attract buyers, the developer is offering discounts of up to 22 per cent. 
 

Market experts said Q Bay Residences will be a test of home buyers' appetite for new developments
 

The 630-unit project, which is a joint venture by Frasers Centrepoint, Far East Organization and Sekisui House. 
 

It will be launched at an average selling price of S$985 per square foot after all discounts this Saturday.
 

This is below the price of most other new suburban launches out in the market for more than S$1,000 per square foot. 
 

The developers of Q Bay Residences said about 550 to 600 buyers put in cheques for pre-booking but about 100 withdrew after the cooling measures were announced.
 

The developer said many are likely to be third and fourth-time property buyers but they are hoping that the project's location in Tampines will entice buyers.

if target audience is HDB dwellers, it will be tough. cos even if they can pay ABSD now and claim refund later, the loan limit will be 50%. unlike private, where homes can have single owner, HDB is mainly dual owners with no possibility of making it single owner. i'm not saying HDB owners are not cash rich but that's like almost asking 500k in cash. i feel HDB owners thinking of upgrading will now be looking at used condos or top ones.
 

although developer should be targeting first timers, i don't think they had that in mind when bidding.

you dun own anything, my advise is just buy something you like for own stay dun really need to time the market cause small island huge population, 10 years cycle you should still be ok. always must have at least 1 property especially we a major chinese city long the market, cause when market run..... very fast can also no return. look at chinese around the world, 99% will wanna be land lord is in the culture unlike ang moh can be cool abt renting. many HKer made fortune from property too. just look at SG property evey 10 years cycle... wont really kill if u owner occup
 

I have colleague who sold their property in end 2010 think property too high will drop 15% to 20%..... since then till now? renting a place $5k per mth equal to $120k spend on rent liao...... if property stay flat or drop by a bit only double whammy    each month no property more $5k gone and all this would have gone to housing loan.
 

truth is also there are many chinese national still cant really speak English and not used to western life, thus choice of cities out of China is Singapore and Hong Kong...... and these pple got $$$ to throw




I agree with you 100%

Singaporeans are top London buyers

 

Singaporeans were the number one overseas buyers of new-build London property in 2012.
 

New research from Knight Frank revealed that buyers from the city-state accounted for 23 percent of all transactions in the sector, only marginally behind the 27 percent of purchases made by UK nationals.
 

Buyers from Hong Kong made up 16 percent of all new-build purchases, while those from China (five percent) and Malaysia (four percent) made up the top five nationalities.
 

Overseas buyers purchased new-build property in London worth some

those who got millions in pocket ... can go shopping

those who bought before cooling measure and can hold ... don't even care what's going on ... hold until cows come home ... besides the property still under development

those who bought in 2009 (lehman collapse) and now the unit is TOP or soon ... even with CM7 sold at 7%-10% discount still can make 80%-100% profit (ie: buy at $700k sell at $1.2M)

i believe theres more than enough rental supply. 
 

plenty of condos flooding the market. but PRs now will also look to rent than buy. so in short, measures were meant to stabilise the market, not crash it. at least now, those who bought condos can have an easier time finding tenants, unlike before CM.

err... CM mainly affects the buyer. So u need to ask yourself how you are affected. Honestly, I don't see it affecting the seller that much unless the number of prospective sellers for his place is greatly reduced. Then he might be tempted to reduct his price. Afterall, the sale price is based on several factors, eg: location, age, distance to amenities, LH/FH etc. Not just CM.
 

Of course if the seller is in a hurry to sell because he needs the funds for his next property, then you can cut loh. As to how much, I don't know. Look at the prices of recently transacted prices and from there, you make a gauge. But since the measure was only launched recently, there might not be any precedence for you to follow.

i think now investors won't sell. those with more than 1 property won't sell cos if sell, buy next one kena CM. 
 

so the only way seller will sell is two things- good price or job security.
 

buyer also won't buy cos think price will drop. so it's just psychological. Ultimate goal of CM is just to reduce volume. For those investing, as long as u can afford, can still buy.

I'm a noob so if that ia true, does it mean we can't see their sales transactions and so the true picture of that development is not revealed?

According to my study done on the property investment in Singapore over the last 6 months, I recently acquired a condo for the investment purpose and now come to know about the new property cooling measures. In this case luck has surely not been on my part. Though, I just wouldn't regret buying the condo as its located in Buona Vista which I feel is one of the better places in Singapore and also for the fact that have got a really good property deal through Property Guru.

Bro, we just don't know when it crashes. May not be 2015. Crashes happen only when most are caught unaware. If everyone knows, the market will correct itself and there will be no crash. So the danger is, we dun know when.



 

yes, mkt crash only happen when everywhere everybody buy and buy. aunty uncle take 110% loan all whack. 
 

currently STI only 3200 not even peak at 3800.. everybody buy becoz scared next CM will price them out. all worried US might crash, europe might crash. there is too much worry everywhere, too much $$ waiting for CM to be lifted to enter mkt. 
 

price will not crash, slight correction maybe. you need years of euphoria (remember 2007/2008 when there was no fear in the mkt)... to crash a high mkt.

on word for singapore property 
 

HUAT !!!!!!!!!!!!
 

those who can sublet hdb ... rental goes up

those who got millions in pocket ... can go shopping

those who bought before cooling measure and can hold ... don't even care what's going on ... hold until cows come home ... besides the property still under development

those who bought in 2009 (lehman collapse) and now the unit is TOP or soon ... even with CM7 sold at 7%-10% discount still can make 80%-100% profit (ie: buy at $700k sell at $1.2M)



 

Of course, still can. The musical chair games is still bright and lively.   Lets see who's the last before the music stops. Still can Huat!!! Hurry, while stocks lasted.

Not directly - but anything that makes a property less "desirable" to buy of course affects sellers...
 

Maybe also, some of the sellers will become buyers once their unit sold.  Maybe those that are PR, or already own property will be caught in the new buyer controls, making their next property more expensive?  So they hold off on selling first?

Yeah, wouldn't expect individual resellers to move so soon (it's only been one week) - but the developers have moved, most mass market drop their prices already. 
 

After a while, we'll see which side is more "determined" - buyers or sellers.  I hope it is buyers - wanna see a bit of a drop....

yup.... if developer can successfully bring the figure for Jan to a decent number.. like ~ 1k units per mth.. Then, they will up their price again. 

If they cannot get the number up to 1k in the next few mths, then, you will see resale seller trying to sell lower to take cover. 
 

Aniway.. many units going to top soon.. Some hdb owners will realised that it's not that simple to get tenants and rent out their excess property.. IF they get the yield that they are expecting, then mkt will hold.. if they dun, you will see them selling liao.

TOP is normally when another payment comes due also right?  So mortgages will go up.  Would assume that conservancy / monthly maintenance charges start at TOP also, so costs go up again. 
 

So cash flow may start to be an issue. 
 

If volume this month not good, then people may start dropping price - once price starts to slide, then you will be adding in those that are scared of losing value - don't need to sell, but scared of big drop. 
 

Still have to wait and see I guess.  From what I hear at the moment, the developer market is still maintaining volume, if not price.

Some 105 units were sold over two days compared to more than 210 at Friday

i really dislike propertyguru filtering system... not very well thought up...



 

I feedback to them before. When I do filter, 90% are new launches.
 

I told them whether can the filtering give a choice of new launches and resale. If I want to only look at resale, I really don't want 90% that appears are new launches.
 

They didn't reply me.....but I understand that their "clients" are agents, not consumers like us. So their filtering has to be favourable to their "clients". And most of their clients are pushing for new launches.

New launch can still filter out by using the built finish year. But what you cannot filter out is EC. They shd also implement options to "not show" XYZ or ABC condos.
 


Apparently, bad weather contributed to the dip in sales. A source told PropertyGuru: “The rain was a factor earlier and more sales are still coming in.”

This guy can join PAP.

now any transaction < $1000 aka $985 for Q Bay ... developer shout sibei cheap liao
 

why anything below $1000 psf is considered cheap ?

near $1000 psf for suburban condo like Q Bay with no MRT, no shopping mall and sibei far demand for $1000 psf?

yesterday, went down to the village@pasir panjong..

My gosh.. they are asking for 1600psf for the freehold 2bdrm. (i.e. $1.38mil)
 

I really wonder how long the mkt going to hold up if everyone is just buying to "park" their $$. 2bdrm rental is only ard 4k.. hardly even cover mthly instalment.
 

think now freehold near mrt is ard $1800psf liao.. Just 6 mths back, $1.2k psf still can get king albert park.

Hi bros,
 

i am considering 2 properties.
 

The first in The Peak@Balmeg which TOP around 2011. 

And the 2nd one is the Village@Pasir Panjang which is still being sold by developers.
 

Village is more expensive but new. I am leaning towards more to the peak coz the average psf is around 1400.
 

Hope to get some comments on which will be a better buy.
 

I am looking at 3 bedroom for own stay

All are out to make money direct or indirect, bro. Things that should look at ,are average income growth, number of FTs and FWs flow and economic data. These are more real than the so call guru or whatever website created to direct the market with self interest. Those in the game, are mainly the agents, property developers and the website owner.     Just be careful and not get suck into the tunnel of so call wealth creator.

tats y only buy when u can afford to. the govt's cooling measure ensures that. ppl gotta fork out 50% dp for the next home. doesn't mean cannot buy, but buy with prudence. good times, bad times, there's always room for investment, even overseas.

Just curious. if you inherit a house, will kenna stamp duty? Assuming one already got a house to his name. For what i understand, as long as names are added to the title deed, kenna new stamp duty.. How about inheritance?



 

In the past, yes. Inheritance was subjected to tax. But laws have changed. :) It was speculated that the laws changed to cater to those with powerful connections. The inheritance related tax had caused some happiness among the powerful and elite. :)

Bro, government earn more revenue.. from developers mainly. Last time $1mil property IRAS makes the 3% stamp duty.. now developer sell the property at discount at 900k, but government collect stamp duty at 3%+ ABSD of 5-15% from a 900k sale.. MND very smart. They know developer margins is 20+-30%.. make developer earn lesser to reduce their funding interest cost only mah

Read an article in todays paper that claimed the govt wants to bring down price, rather than just slow down the rate of growth - the analyst claimed that if price don't come down this time, govt still has a sledge hammer that they can take out. 
 

So be warned hor!

I don't believe these analysts.
 

Like today, CNA got an article saying the prioritisation scheme of BTO flats for parents with a kid under 16 yo should lower the COVs since demand would be directed to BTO sales from the resale market. 
 

I don't see how it would happen
 

1) The scheme would just direct those without kids under 16 from the BTO to resale

2) Also, BTO takes 3-4 yrs to complete. Some parents might not be able to wait so long so they rather stick with resale.

3) There is still a lot of pent-up demand which the current supply is not able to meet.
 

For COV to drop, you need to tweak the demand and supply.  What I see instead is simply a reshuffling the buyers between BTO and resale. This is not tweaking the demand. As for the supply, enough said.

White Paper 'to benefit property, transport'
 

Published on Jan 21, 2013
 
 

THE Singapore Population White Paper due to be released by the Government later this month will spell good news for construction firms, DBS Vickers has said in a new report.
 

In the longer term, companies in the transport, property and health-care sectors will also benefit from issues likely to be raised in the paper, it said.
 

Analysts from the brokerage wrote in a report last Friday that they expect the Government to revise upwards Singapore's population planning parameter from 6.5million to seven million.
 

"We continue to see long-term benefits accruing to domestic- driven sectors, particularly public transport, property and health care," they said.
 

"There will be a need for infrastructure to cater to a larger population, so we expect the construction sector to benefit as well."
 

With the high growth in ridership and gripes about crowded trains, one key focus would likely be on further development of the transport infrastructure to prepare for a larger population, they added.
 

But while the long-term projection for rail ridership growth will bode well for SMRT, this may be outweighed by near-term cost challenges such as staff, repair and maintenance expenses, they said.
 

Instead, they prefer ComfortDelGro for its stable growth profile, and have reiterated a "buy" call on the stock.
 

The construction industry will benefit from continued infrastructure spending, they said.
 

"While we are positive on construction demand as a whole, we are more bullish on building resource providers as opposed to contractors."
 

Contractors are operating in a lower-margin, higher-cost environment, they said, while building resource firms will likely enjoy higher sale prices, as demand for resources outstrips supply.
 

Their top stock picks for the sector are Tat Hong and Pan United, and they also have "buy" calls on Yong Nam, Tiong Seng and OKP.
 

Property developers will benefit too as the Government appears set to ramp up housing supply, the analysts said.
 

"These would include those with large landbanks such as City Developments and Bukit Sembawang."
 

Developers which tap more frequently into the government land sale programme for land parcels, such as CapitaLand, Keppel Land, UOL, Wing Tai and Ho Bee as well as smaller developer-cum-construction companies, will also benefit, they added.
 

Given that there has been continued focus on population growth and ageing, the analysts said the Government will likely introduce more incentives to encourage Singaporeans to marry and have children.
 

"One potential beneficiary we see is CordLife Group, which provides cord blood stem banking," they said.
 

"Assuming there is added incentive for procreation, we expect to see a further perk-up in birth rates from 2014, which could benefit CordLife."

210 units sold in a day at new condo
 

Buyers drawn by discount offered by developers to offset cooling measures
 

Published on Jan 19, 2013
 
 

JUST one week after the latest round of tough property cooling measures, more than 210 homes were sold yesterday at a new Tampines condominium.
 

Buyers at a preview of the 630-unit Q Bay Residences were attracted by a discount of 5 to 7 per cent offered by the developers to help offset the measures.
 

By noon, the showflat in Tampines Avenue 1 was crowded with hundreds of buyers jostling to get in on the action despite the harsh new curbs, such as higher stamp duty and a need for some buyers to stump up more cash upfront.
 

Q Bay, developed by Frasers Centrepoint, Far East Organization and Sekisui House, is the first private residential project to be launched after the measures.
 

The most popular units were suites. The project's buyers were mainly first-timers intending to live there, said Mr Cheang Kok Kheong, chief executive of Frasers Centrepoint Homes.
 

Average prices were lowered to $985 per sq ft (psf) from $1,050 psf as the developers offered discounts of 5 per cent to 7 per cent to cushion the impact of the additional buyer's stamp duty.
 

Buyers whom The Straits Times spoke to included first-timers, singles and investors who had paid off the mortgages on their existing homes. Many were drawn by the discounts and were largely unaffected by the measures.
 

Madam Maria Samuel, 55, purchased a five-bedroom apartment. She had been looking for a second home for some time and is unaffected by the measures as the loan for her current home in Flora Road has already been paid off.
 

"I was told that prices might fall a bit due to the measures but real estate is a good investment and it's the safest... It is a retirement home for us and we do not intend to take a large loan.
 

"The developer is also absorbing the stamp duty so there is already a price discount there."
 

Civil servant Clement Ng, 30, a first-time home buyer, is buying a unit as an investment as the area has good access to good schools. He paid about $514,000 for a 527 sq ft one-bedroom unit or $976 psf. "I thought about waiting but... a reputable developer will try to keep prices as high as possible. It's very unlikely they will bid for a land site and sell it at a loss.
 

"It is a bold move for me but as a first-time buyer, I see the measures as an opportunity instead to come in and get the benefits. It is clear that there are uncertainties ahead, but I just have to ensure that I buy what I can pay for."
 

A 25-year-old buyer, who declined to disclose his name, picked up two apartments at Q Bay yesterday - one for himself and another for his sister. He said their parents will be assisting them with the investment.
 

But some developers are more cautious as they assess the impact of the seventh and most extensive round of measures to date.
 

The launch of Tuan Sing Holdings' Sennett Residence in Potong Pasir will be delayed till the end of next month from its original January launch owing to the measures, said its chief financial officer Chong Chou Yuen. "We're ready but we want to wait and see, and give buyers some time to get used to the measures. We haven't finalised any stamp duty discounts yet and are still considering them."

Speculators may turn to commercial property
 

Analysts expect heightened interest after curbs on industrial sector
 

Published on Jan 19, 2013
 

BUYER interest in commercial property is growing in the wake of last week's cooling measures, which included curbs on red-hot industrial property.
 

Experts said commercial property, as yet untouched by any of the seven rounds of cooling measures, could become the new target segment of speculators.
 

All eyes are now on upcoming launches of office and retail space, which analysts said could be oversubscribed.
 

The industrial cooling measures consist of a seller's stamp duty, imposed for the first time on the sector.
 

It ranges from 5 to 15 per cent and applies to industrial property or land sold within three years of purchase.
 

This is meant to dampen speculative activity in the industrial segment, where prices have doubled over the past three years.
 

But analysts suggested this was like plugging a leak only to have another spring up.
 

"I'm worried about the impact on the commercial segment," said Mr Roy Chong, head of business space at PropNex.
 

He noted that when the Government capped industrial leases at 30 years in a bid to make them more affordable for genuine industrialists, prices of 60-year leasehold industrial properties shot up.
 

This time round, the seller's stamp duty for industrial property could drive speculative activity into other sectors, notably commercial and retail, analysts said.
 

"Investors would most likely turn to commercial, retail, and possibly shophouses, for which the authorities have not imposed any cooling measures," said Mr Tan Boon Leong, executive director of industrial services at Colliers International.
 

The heightened interest could result in sellers of commercial or retail space raising their asking prices by between 5 and 10 per cent, Mr Tan said.
 

SLP International research director Nicholas Mak told The Straits Times his agency had received more enquiries over the past week about resale commercial units, though there was no indication yet on whether that would translate into real demand.
 

Knight Frank senior manager Alice Tan noted that prices of strata offices are holding firm in spite of the softer rental market.
 

This can be seen in the healthy take-up rate of strata offices in launches such as PS100 in Tanjong Pagar, Paya Lebar Square and the upcoming SBF Center in Robinson Road, Ms Tan said.
 

Consultants said the level of buyer interest in the launch of SBF Center as well as that of upcoming Alexandra Central will be a good indicator of whether demand has shifted towards the commercial segment.
 

SBF Center, developed by Far East Organization, is next to Capital Tower and is expected to launch early next month.
 

Alexandra Central is a 99-year leasehold mixed development by Chip Eng Seng, located next to Ikea on Alexandra Road. It is expected to launch within the next few weeks.
 

Chip Eng Seng's property development and investment arm CEL Development paid $189 million for the 85,517 sq ft site in December 2011. This works out to $789 psf per plot ratio.
 

The strata shop units at Alexandra Central are likely to be $5,000 to $7,000 psf while strata office units at SBF Center are likely to go for $2,400 psf or above, according to The Edge magazine.
 

Overall, DWG senior manager Lee Sze Teck expects strata office space prices to climb as much as 10 per cent this year, though he said the prices of retail space could remain flat due to uncertain market conditions.

Buyers snap up units at Alexandra Central
 

99-year leasehold commercial devt attracts overwhelming interest
 
 



ALMOST every unit of a mixed development launched in Alexandra yesterday has been snapped up - a stark sign that buyers are turning to commercial property in the wake of new cooling measures.

Only one of the 115 strata retail units released remained unsold as at 9pm yesterday after a dramatic day of sales that caught even the developer by surprise.

It was estimated that at least 20 buyers on average were competing for each unit at the 99-year leasehold Alexandra Central, while a shop space on the third storey had as many as 155 interested buyers submitting blank cheques for a ballot.

"I had strong confidence in the project but didn't expect it to do so well," said Chip Eng Seng group chief executive Raymond Chia.

The units were sold at between $4,000 and $8,000 per sq ft, said a spokesman from CEL Development, Chip Eng Seng's property arm.

Alexandra Central is next to Ikea and on the site of the former Safra building in Alexandra Road. CEL Development paid $189 million, or $789 psf per plot ratio, for the 85,517 sq ft site in 2011.

The project includes 31 food and beverage retail units and 85 shop units. The largest shop unit in the project was not launched for sale yesterday.

Mr Chia said Alexandra Central received an unexpectedly high level of interest when it was opened for preview over the weekend.

"We initially planned a soft launch on Wednesday but because the response was so overwhelming we decided to bring it forward to Monday," Mr Chia added.

When The Straits Times visited the showflat yesterday afternoon, it was packed with agents and buyers, some of whom had been there as early as 9am.

Some were genuine end-users hoping to secure shop space before prices rose further, while others said they were interested in investing in commercial property.

Mr Simon Chye, 55, who runs snack shop business Hello Food, bought a 667 sq ft F&B retail unit on the first floor for around $4,538,000.

Mr Chye, who plans to open an outlet in Alexandra Central, said in Mandarin that he wanted to buy shop space now as prices were rising, and thought the project had a good location.

Investors were drawn to the project because of the recent cooling measures imposed on the residential and industrial sectors.

Madam Zheng Fuying, 48, said in Mandarin that she was interested in investing in commercial space as it was the only segment of the market untouched by the new cooling measures.

She added that she wanted to buy shop space as a long-term investment because retail space was getting more expensive but the market was not yet overheated.

Alexandra Central will include a 450-room hotel managed by Park Hotel Group. Construction is expected to be completed by June 2016.

Some question i would like to post to the ones here.
 

1. Property cooling measures is never only dealing with the demand and supply. If the banks cannot lend so much money on those property , how would people have enough money to "roll" their properties.
 

2. If you mean the rich are filled with cash and the rich becomes richer , then property taxes for private property should be increase in the same manner of how income tax via different tiers. Stamp duty should also be much higher for properties above a certain price.
 

3. The main issue about the rising property prices is partially due to the impression of many that they have not much to "invest" to hedge off again inflation , why not the government come out with a bond which matches the inflation in singapore?
 
 

4. How can the current cooling measure improve the lifes of the people below the median income? I don't see how those measure can improve their lifes.

Haha money come in is trapped if the garmen knows how to deal with it, thats why i mention about have a proportional tax or stamp duty on properties above a certain valuation and this can be revised via inflation numbers , the excess money can be used to issue "inflation proof" bonds. <-- maybe we can set aside some amounts of our cpf to be placed in this fund.
 
 

It is a win win thingy.

Your points sound like the following to me:
 

1. Close the market. No more free market.

2. Please spoonfeed the less rich. 

3. Please spoonfeed everyone.

4. Current spoonfeeding not enough. Can you do more?

read this bond proposal before by some local consultant, but so far nothing. US got TIP, Treasury Inflation Protected security.
 

well for every bull mkt, sentiment aka impression is wat drives pple to pay higher n higher. I say let the mkt run up until cannot take it anymore n then the crash will sure come just a matter of time. Those who play stocks will know exactly wat im saying.

1. No , if the percentage is greatly improved , the chances of a property bubble bursting from "speculation" is greatly reduced since the % loan given is lower , chances are risk is reduced. It is still a free market , but housing shouldn't be something which should be a free market especially if you were to include public housing. If you want to do investment , do keep public housing out of it.
 

2. Distribution of wealth to a certain extend should always be the notion in any successful country to keep everyone happy and this in turns move the country forward.
 

3. Win win , only losers are speculators spoil the market here and runs with the profits. This is to protect our people which are stuck here.
 

4. Why not? Improve our education level , create more business opportunities , free up intellect concepts and invest in intellectual development.

actually , it created quite alot of problems which lead our country to do something and thus contributing to our current COE and property prices. Thats said , SG is a net exporting country and US is a net consumer country.

Read an article in todays paper that claimed the govt wants to bring down price, rather than just slow down the rate of growth - the analyst claimed that if price don't come down this time, govt still has a sledge hammer that they can take out. 
 

So be warned hor!




Wahahaha
 

After 7 CMs, still don't take out sledgehammer....don't have say don't have. or rather wayang say wayang lah.

after that he offer to me $55k below asking price. i didn't respond.
 

next time he send me sms say unit send for option to purchase liao.

U may not want it at 55k discount. But there are many eager buyers out there desperate to park their money and get into this whole get rich quick game

bro, if u were the seller, wld u let go at 200k below?



 
 

no la, his asking price was too high anyway.  $200k is not exactly the reduction i asked for.  let me illustrate
 

there were 2 similar units last done 1.01m (3rd floor) and 1.1m (17th floor).  his asking is also 1.1m, so he is trying to ask for a high price despite being on floor closer to the 3rd floor unit.  a fair price for his unit would be say 1m without any CM7.
 

so i reasoned to him with CM7, sales will be slow moving.  so perhaps his seller can lower price to secure a firm buyer rather than wait a few months for his 1.1m which might never happened.  it is an opportunity to test if this is a desperate seller for which i have to admit i was hoping to pick up things on the cheap due to Cm7.

i know there are some buyers willing to do so.
 

i was just hoping that i am the only buyer there at such strategic time and hoping he was an eager seller.
 

to be fair, CM5 i saw some properties offloaded on the cheap.  so that's not to say my offer is unrealistic.  just need a little luck.

haha true.....this agent i dealt with also someone green.  his stand keep wavering when i talk to him.  but there are probably many other agents trying to sell this unit too.
 

my suspicion is that it is not his skills that sold the unit.  it is jsut that one buyer quite anxious to beat the CM7 stamp duty he quickly agree to the price without much research so he can backdate the option and hence avoid paying the ABSD.

Calm down. Calm down. You guys are taking the assumption as fact.
 

New Citizen. Who is eligible to become a new citizen. There is a filtering process by the goverment. You think those earning less than $2k can get citizen?

So far, the new citizen I know, are mostly professional. They.... don't really need the priority. Of course, they might get some benefits now.
 

So, this policy, I think is targeting the real poor Singaporean, who has been renting HDB flats from the goverment. It can also be those who got married young, but no money to buy flat and 'temporary' staying with parents until their children already grown up.

They are the group, who missed the opportunity to make money from surging housing price.
 

If my assumption is correct, then, the goverment is doing the right thing.

The problem is, the policy maker does not want the property market to crash. At the same time to appreciate and keep asset prices low. How to do it??? It's already known fact, a artificially inflated.  The snowball is so huge and there is no turning back. So the asset prices of property in Singapore is in a dangerous level. We just need a "Black Swan" event to trigger the house of cards to collapse. There are some leading indications of late property market boom. Make no mistakes, the game is still hot and may take a few of years. Is not a matter of housing cost. As long as one can service the loans, the game goes well.

Interest Rates Will Spike This Year: Soros
 

The Freezing measure may be coming... ha ha ha .. are you ready ?
 


There will be a dramatic rise in interest rates as soon as there are clear signs the U.S. economy is picking up, billionaire financier George Soros told CNBC.  

Soros said that the U.S. needs to reestablish growth to help shrink its debt pile and that the Federal Reserve's policy of buying U.S. debt, is the right one since it doesn't add to the net amount of debt outstanding. "It's about as close to a free lunch as you can get," he said. 
 

But there is a risk, Soros warned, "Once the economy gets going, then interest rates are going to take a big leap."

It doesn't need high unemployment to confirm. Current economic environment is unique and artificially created y policies implementation. Tightening of FT/FW have created high employment rate. The current economic environment is in danger. Once the interest rate revert, it is interesting to see how this pan out to be. When interest rate starts to escalate, is a signal of further tightening and peaking of the economy.

Whatever BOR it comes from, all banks round the world are closely knitted. Tell me which bank in the world, leave money on the table.? Once the is a slightest chance of hiking rate, banks will take the opportunity to earning more profits. The interest rate hike, may comes earlier than 2015. 

The moral of the story, is not to work of banks. But let banks work of you.

Hmm... can some one help me do this maths...
 

if the gov say.. will be getting 30k PR + 15K new citizens SG per year from now to 2020..
 

So every year ave , 45k / 4 = 11.25k new pr and new citizen families , then another 25k new newly weds... So every year there is 36.25k new families eligible for HDB.
 
 

7 yrs to 2020 = 7 x 36.25k = 253k families... how come they only build 70k hdbs until 2020 ? If i assume that the 45k are working adults and add in single 35yr old adults.. then the hdb numbers is even more serverly under built ?

Hmm... can some one help me do this maths...
 

if the gov say.. will be getting 30k PR + 15K new citizens SG per year from now to 2020..
 

So every year ave , 45k / 4 = 11.25k new pr and new citizen families , then another 25k new newly weds... So every year there is 36.25k new families eligible for HDB.
 
 

7 yrs to 2020 = 7 x 36.25k = 253k families... how come they only build 70k hdbs until 2020 ? If i assume that the 45k are working adults and add in single 35yr old adults.. then the hdb numbers is even more serverly under built ? 
 

did i undestand wrongly or what?

According to my study done on the property investment in Singapore over the last 6 months, I recently acquired a condo for the investment purpose and now come to know about the new property cooling measures. In this case luck has surely not been on my part. Though, I just wouldn't regret buying the condo as its located in Buona Vista which I feel is one of the better places in Singapore and also for the fact that have got a really good property deal through Property Guru.

actually only took them 2 weekends to move all the 1200 plus psf units, but those are barely breakeven.  They are barely at the 1000 unit mark for the whole development, and unless they also bring the prices down for the units at the higher level, it looks like those can barely move.   
 

who say developer bid high for land wont lose money

Finally, the show-stopper is coming...
 

Source: REUTERS
 

SINGAPORE, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Singapore's central bank is expected to scrap its U.S. dollar-linked interbank lending rate, according to a banker with knowledge of regulators' reviews into the setting of interest rates following the Libor rate rigging scandal.
 

The Monetary Authority of Singapore ordered members of the Association of Banks in Singapore in July to review how they set their benchmark interbank lending rates, focusing on the Singapore interbank offer rate (Sibor) and the Swap Offer Rate (SOR).
 

The order came after U.S. and UK authorities uncovered widespread manipulation of the London interbank lending rate (Libor).
 

The banker said, in a text message exchange with Reuters, that as a result of those reviews the abolition of the U.S. dollar Sibor was "likely".
 

The MAS provided no new comment on the matter when contacted by Reuters. In December, the regulator said the reviews were ongoing and it was premature to speculate on their outcomes.
 

U.S. dollar Sibor is a measure of the cost of borrowing U.S. dollars in the Singapore interbank market, and is used to price loans made by Singapore banks in U.S. dollars. Banks can use alternatives, like the U.S. dollar Libor rate.
 

The more significant market in Singapore is the Singapore dollar Sibor, which is used as the reference price for many commercial and home loans in the city-state.
 

The MAS probe was extended in late September when the regulator said banks must also look at how rates for non-deliverable foreign exchange forwards are set.
 

Reuters reported last month that bank reviews found that NDF rates had been manipulated as well.
 

Singapore's probe was similar to those launched by other regulators across the globe following last year's Libor scandal, when U.S. and UK authorities unveiled widespread rigging of the London interbank rate, a benchmark used to price more than $500 trillion worth of contracts from derivatives to mortgage rates to credit cards.
 

U.S. and UK regulators have fined three banks to date - RBS, Barclays and UBS - a total of $2.6 billion for allowing traders to manipulate Libor interbank rates.
 

Bloomberg reported earlier on Monday that Singapore's central bank was considering ending the city-state's U.S. dollar-linked interbank lending rate. Citing an anonymous source, the report said members of the Singapore Foreign Exchange Market Committee in a Jan. 22 meeting examined the proposal during a discussion of MAS's review of benchmark rates.
 

The group may instead use the U.S. dollar London interbank offered rate, the article said, with changes expected by June.
 

Thomson Reuters, parent company of Reuters News, acts as the agent for the Association of Banks in Singapore, collecting and calculating the rates. (Reporting by Rachel Armstrong; Additional reporting by Elzio Barreto and Kevin Lim; Editing by Michael Flaherty and Simon Cameron-Moore)

but you'll lose transparency. banks don't disclose COF so you'll be going in blind.
 

however, with the libor scandal, "transparency" wont really help much will it?
 

interestingly enough ... saw a place and made an offer ... owner said if he didnt get his exact price, he wont sell. today got a call from the agent .. owner suddenly willing to drop price by about 6-7% if can produce cheque. and i only saw the place last week lol ...

I think the CM is causing the price to go up!
 

We had so many CMs and the price keeps going higher.
 

Last time no CM and the price didn't go so high.
 

If someone said they will restrict the supply of rice tomorrow,
 

everyone will go and stock up. The stock up will result in the shortage.
 

Then the price of rice will go up.
 

So maybe if we removed all CM the price might fall
 

as everyone that wants to buy can do so as there
 

are now no more restrictions.

History has shown our prop mkt crashes when 1) rates jump a lot 2) global recession. If u look at 2007-2008, it was only obvious a big collapse wld happen much closer to Lehman, I think just after Washington mutual n aig crash. What I mean is a bull run can last a lot longer than we think before the big decline

actually really scary 

if you take a step back
 

majority of people earn less than 3K

but most cars are generally more than 100k

hdb already touch 1mil
 

public transport and taxi so expensive
 

where is there money left to spend
 

i really feel sorry for the chickens in geylang
 

but i really dislike property agents (most) 

i have never come across one that have not carrot me before
 

why even with all the exams and criteria

still turn out agents like that
 

the second group i dislike are 

insurance agents

they hound you until your pants drop

but after you buy from them 

they are no where to be seen

until they got something new to offer
 
 

am i the only one feeling this way

May I know the song title please  
 




actually really scary 

if you take a step back
 

majority of people earn less than 3K

but most cars are generally more than 100k

hdb already touch 1mil
 

public transport and taxi so expensive
 

where is there money left to spend
 

i really feel sorry for the chickens in geylang
 

but i really dislike property agents (most) 

i have never come across one that have not carrot me before
 

why even with all the exams and criteria

still turn out agents like that
 

the second group i dislike are 

insurance agents

they hound you until your pants drop

but after you buy from them 

they are no where to be seen

until they got something new to offer
 
 

am i the only one feeling this way

Maybe it's not to kill it but to prevent it from getting to hot and then burst. 
 

If there is a way to allow much slower price hikes, ideally more or less matching the national income/salary growth rate, thus avoiding the boom and bust cycle as much as possible, we can then see a more stable property market, some call it a healthy and "sustainable" market.

Yeah, one way is to cut off the upward push. By pressing HDB prices down, private properties will suffer as there will be lesser upgrader.

mr khaw said price reduction in bto but also "protect" interest of existing owners ..
 

thus i suspect that there will be terms and conditions attached for bto in future.
 

1. longer mop? 7 to 10 yrs mop before you can do anything with your flat?
 

2. Higher resale levy if sell the bto unit
 

3. restrict PR ownership in someways? like one chance to buy bto compare to 2 for citizens? 
 

maybe other measures....gov is very creative and daring nowadays so who knows?

protection for existing owners can only go so far.
 

U cannot expect and landing without hurting certain grps of buyers... especially when they are buying at the peak of the mkt.

personal opinion only:-
 

in the long run, rate of property hikes (especially public housing) should more or less match the rate of national average income growth rate (especialy for salaried workers)
 

the figures you have put above have to be compared with the salaries of target buyers of these flats. i am not sure how ah khaw arrived at these figures, and also whether he tried to relate the prices to salaries. I hope he did though.

Yaa. Those days, we have so empty flat around when the property market cashed. I can even take time to choose the best location. 
 

Today, those policy makers know by continuing building, the market with be over supply. So by countering this effect, they pump in another 2mil to sustain the value and move higher.

i dun know why.. but everywhere is hyping that rental for pte will go up if there is more restriction on hdb..in the future
 

but the budget just impose a weighty rule that will make rental go down i.e. landlord can no longer claim exemption for pty tax due to vancancy.. and also the hefty increase in pty tax.
 

Together with more condo TOP , i will see more landlord succumb to lower rent now.. instead of letting the unit go vacant.

In 1998, bought a five room flat $280k . Back than, our combined salaries were $11k. So it works out to be :
 

$11k x 12 x 4 = $528, worked out to be 1.8 times . But now, one need 4 years? Wah! Very tough.  



 

$11k cannot buy from HDB direct.
 

you bought resale is it?

u obviously dont know the market well. 
 

FT not buying due to extra stamp duties (its outright penalty no joke),all private landlord mark up to cover extra tax. FTs Lan Lan pay higher rental lor. 
 

If Rent HDB, max 1.5 years only, no facilities and its 'public' housing , not atas.
 

So many ang mo / indians taking up mid to high position. (they simply cannot find work in their home country) Busloads or trainloads even of them actually.

??? landed also not stable lah. I think landed went up by more than 100%... so if the rest fall, landed also fall....
 

you think who can afford 3million for landed? It is those people who sold their condos for 2million...



 

but the fall is never as steep as the rest due to lack of supply.

can...provided finish the min occupation period. but best to buy pte and rent out HDB. better buy HDB before some silly new rule that stop HDB ppl from buying PTE without selling comes out. Many HDB owners have benefited greatly from keeping the super high rental yield for HDB while staying in nice pte home. Decide fast! kena 7% absd just pay up.

We cannot underestimate the pain of structuring are intensifying. Especially the employment are closely link to property value. The excess demand will ease and in inflationary pressures weaken. With the gov toying on HDB resell back to to HDB, that is really the trigger point asset price deep correction. So goes to the mass market private ones may follow suit. Aside, we are seeing more SMEs are in the process of moving out or shutting. If the global economy does not bounce back strongly, the intense restructuring could actually turn deflection. That add pressure to reduce costs will intensify, forcing wages, rental and other local input costs to fail as they did in 2001.

Landed is the purple line. Rose the fastest during the last cycle (96/97) and also crashed the most.
 

Now, once again, it has risen the fastest... so the crash will be...

As a landlord, i dun see how it is possible  to cover instalment by rent if you buy now (resale/just top).  With the increasing property tax as well as the absd, it looks unattractive to getting a new unit now.
 

Many developer are "struck" with unsold units.. that soon they will need to start to pay penalty..

Almost 30% of the condo ( top 2011)  that i am staying is currently unoccupied. Owners of these units will start to lower their rental demand with the increasing cost of holding empty unit. 
 

I see that developer will be dunking their their unsold units soon.. while pte owners selling off their TOPS units to max their return. Chances is there will be less ppl renting in the next few mths.. as they have acquired their own units over the last 3 mths.. Many locals that have sold their flats/pte and renting to wait for the price correction have bought their new home..Foreigner at the sideline also decided to jump in liao.
 

And more vacant units will be under the pressure to be rent out at a lower rent...
 

Let's see how it turns...

i think need to see the objective of purchase... if the objective is to "make" $$ , investment.. i think its probably time to cash out liao.. if for own stay... then. anytime is good time..

do you know alot of private properties are usually bought by foreigners ...IN CASH. 
 

just to relate you a story.. I was invited to a pre launch at Sennett residence.  Beside me was a indon lady.. I overheard their conversation...
 

Prospect: I hear recently got cooling measures ah

Agent: Yes, about loan % and foreigners must pay more stamp duty

Prospect: Oh issit why like that ah.

Agent: Er... Mdm, you PR ?

Prospect: No.

Agent: Oh so you are kinda affected...how much loan will you be keen ?

Prospect: Aiya so troublesome ... give me this 2 room and 3 room unit. I pay CASH .

Agent: Sure ,sure .. lets have a seat there .
 
 

There you have it . 
 

Ask your friendly next door agent if the property market has cooled.. I bet NOT. Its not so frantic but prices have not and I think will not crash. Short correction yes but not to extent of dumping.  Singapore remains one of the safest place to park money (long term). The rich appreciates that , the poor complain of high cost/standard of living.
 

Even looking at local context, most salaried hdb folks, work and work,end of the day, most would want a 'better' environment to enjoy ..same applies to car . Hence its always a big pool of ready buyers .
 

Singapore being a small island, no country side,no scenery...people are in a constant rat race. Sometimes alot will be sucked into the devilish route of upgrading upgrading. When you stay in a vast country,more relaxing cos hear no evil, see no evil.  NOT Singapore.

my agent fren say mkt confirm has slowed especially resale. New sales still ok due to progressive payment nature so no need to take loan upfront. Resale because have to loan or pay on total prop value is much slower. Another fren of mine who owns multiple properties here also admits seeing cracks in pricing n price disparities, in other words only specific projects r doing well, others seem to either b flat or even dropped in price.

Developers will not dump. Ask Far east to lower prices ? Fat chance  they can afford to leave it empty or rent out. 
 

Why SC global wanna delist ? To turn private , so SC does not need to be pressured to answer to board by le long the uber high properties. 
 

Singapore really got a lot of rich people. Some one posted a drink bill of 60k. I was treated to a dinner , 6 pax. Bill came to 40k. (thats some dude i year salary)

If you did that, you will be going exactly to the plan the Govt has for Singaporeans.
 

Their plan: Singapore is only for the rich to live, the poor and middle class please live outside singapore but still remain Singaporeans to contribute to our coffers. Retirees please fxxx off also.
 

Iskandar region is just the beginning of that plan.
 

They are envisioning a future in which all the low level Singaporeans and PRs/FW live in surrounding areas and make a 2 hour commute to earn their living in Singapore.  I wouldn't be surprised if the MRT system extends to Iskandar region. It will be like Greater London, Tokyo, and New Jersey/New York.
 

That's why "Singapore is not a country", not in the conventional sense.

i rem the fund which bot the block at balmoral n flipped for abt 500psf profit quickly is really good.  ahedge fund linked to lien family... then others such as roxy pacific n fragrance also good momentum players.
 

just watch d next big crash, all the big boys no balls again, then the real players come out n get good deals.

seriously.. these hdb flats buyers has holding power.. they could fork out 200-300k downpayment without selling their current place to "finance"..Worse come worse they sell their hdb if there is downturn... they will never never sell at lost for both properties. 
 

However, as mentioned rental is a totally different issue.. landlord very much want to cover the expenses by rental. dun want to pay a 1 k of maintenace fee , property tax and loan interest and get back nothing each mth.

not as simple as it seems..
 

i worked for both the 'big boys' and the boutique ones.
 

There are many reasons why the big boys seem to always copy cat and miss the boat. We had many astute and seasoned guys on the team, but there are many backroom politics involved which caused dismal results. Then again, we also scored a few big ones that made crazy amt of money.
 

the ones i respect are those who are low profiled and dun try to play the flipping tricks. They work the asset hard and create value out of nothing.

thats wat i mean their size is their limitation, to much approvals required n even worse if the top rank approvers  r generals n scholars w zero biz experience lol... tats y small guys can act fast.
 

work hard create value requires alot of time n $$, something most small guys dun have the mandate or pleasure to. They strike, make $ n run.

creating value will make your business sustainable. You need that if u plan to raise more money in future. It's harder to attract money nowadays
 

strike and run is usually for the part timers.. those with spare cash in their balance sheets or those tempted by the easy money in the mkt.

do u thk theyre owning or renting the hdb flats, while waiting for the new condos to complete?



 
 

with the exception of those that bought EC.. i believe most are waiting to see how the the mkt goes..

I believe most of them will want to keep both properties..
 

Whether they sell their HDB, depends largely on the real estate condition when it tops... Some buy 2nd pty because they need an address for their children pri 1 enrollment , so there are many factors..
 

but 1 thing for sure.. they have cash/cpf of closed to 300k to put downpayment and no problem with loan approval...

think so.. unless there is major change in the hdb rental.. then i will see many selling their hdb.. because of depreciating value. 

Most ppl plans to rent out 1, and use the rental to offset their pte instalments. By doing so, they own 2 fully paid pty after x years.. as part of their retirement plan. 

For these ppl, its very long term planning.. unless pty drop by alot or unemployed for > 1 yr.. they wont be selling anytime.. 
 

i even heard at least 2 cases, hdb and pte impending to rent out..

while ownself rent to stay near pri registeration school..

yup. because of the "cooling measure" that private property owners cannot buy HDB, I think NOBODY will sell HDB after buying condo. 
 

If you look at it, that cooling measure actually did more harm than good. Ever since that measure came up, HDB resale price went up even more. I mean it is common sense right. I think the number of private property owners looking to buy HDB is much less than those HDB owners looking to buy private property. All you did is to reduce the supply far more than the demand...
 

I think they should change the HDB rental rules after implementing the above measure to encourage more HDB owners to sell of their HDB after upgrading to private. 
 

If you look at the policy it is TOTALLY illogical. Why can't a private property owner buy a resale HDB??? The ONLY reason I can see is that private property owners should not take up resale HDB (public housing) as they can afford other housing. But if you take the above reason, then there is no way you should allow a HDB owner who has bought private property to keep their HDB as the reason applies to them too.

well for now supply doesnt meet demand, but next few yrs when the record new hdb flats TOP, this big chunk of pple currently renting private or resale hdb flats will move into their new hdb flats, or sell their private apt since cant own both at same time. Then combine that w the record new condos TOPing also at same time, PLUS the new foreign worker restrictions n white paper reducing population growth rate to abt half of what it was last 10yrs, is combo of events which nobody knows how itll turn out...

When the new hdb flats top, you probably will have more resale HDB supply BUT to introduce the CM of disallowing private property owners to buy HDB is just plain stupid.
 

All it did was to add oil to fire...

garmen revealed recnetly that majority of new launch mass mkt buyers r HDB address. 
 

My question is: do these buyers sell/move out of their existing HDB flats when their new condos TOP, or flip the condo before TOP/CSC n stay back in their HDB flat?




Brother.. This hdb address thing may not be reflective lah.. Example, I do not have hdb flat but my nric address is a hdb address because it's my father in law address... So for past properties I buy, will always reflect as buyer with hdb address.. Aka hdb upgrader.. I'm sure alot of buyer in SG also like in my case.

 bro,  when hdb tops,  none of the owner has pte to sell hecause.. none of the owns a pte apt 30 mth before they ballot... and cannot acquire while waiting.... ha ha ha......
 
 

And bro, many ppl has no problems servicing installments for a long long time without rental. Like holding on to a underperformed stock... some ppl will just hold on until the next up cycle...rather than sellijg at a loss.

Hdb is meant for general middle low income public which make of majority, but to link with open mkt which is volatile n they include pte ppty n land ppty will only push Hdb price higher.

Affordability is the key to next young generation who just start up family, impact is for long term.

Looks like no immediate solution to bring down the price but only to keep cooling the market.

but khaw first mooted the idea of future sale of resale HDB back to HDB at cost plus basis, i thought they finally summoned all the courage to do what's right but unpleasant.
 

then yesterday he did a u-turn, saying any changes will affect only new buyers.  this will create two segments of distinctly different HDB market.
 

cost-plus priced HDB for the poor and market-driven priced HDB for the not-poor-but-act-poor class.
 

it seems like the second group can have the cake and eat it too unless they stretch the MOP for the second group to more than the cursory 5 years for them to be allowed to buy private property.

Landed is the purple line. Rose the fastest during the last cycle (96/97) and also crashed the most.
 

Now, once again, it has risen the fastest... so the crash will be...



 

96-97 population much smaller, financing of those homes were also a breeze. The conditions for a spectacular crash were different compared to today.

i agree. no pte owners with HDB will ever sell the HDB with this silly rule. Talk about squeezing supply. Tats y always see the results of the cooling measure rather than the intention of the cooling measure. U judge the intention by the results, not what is declared in the press.

many recent hdb owners will be screwed big time cos the moment that happens, hdb prices will barely grow and there goes the retirement of these jokers who paid high prices for their hdb using cpf.

yep.....that's why someone wrote in to say since khaw's announcement on sunday, she has been having sleepless nights.  we have discussed many times before the flawed hdb policy seemingly like drugs given to hdb owners to make them feel high.  if you take away the drugs from them, they will have withdrawal symptom.
 

but does it really make sense to have 2 HDB markets?

New private home sales fall sharply in February
 

SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes in Singapore fell sharply in February, due to the Lunar New Year holidays, fewer launches and the government's latest round of cooling measures.
 

However, analysts said it is still too early to gauge the effectiveness of the cooling measures introduced earlier this year.
 

According to data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority, 708 new units were sold during the month, down by almost 65 percent from January's 2,016 units.

Buyer that buys later  will suffer more when the prices are artifically suppressed by policies 
 

The longer a buyer waits, the more rules he is subjected to .. higher MOP , lower LTV , more absd , assd etc etc .. cannot buy car .. cannot buy that. 
 

Look at it.. those that has bought their resale flat earlier had enjoyed shorter MOP.

Those that bought their pte earlier can sell within 4 yrs without MOP.. Loan were easier and interest rate (Spread) is lower.. and legal fee waiver.
 

I only can say.. if you need a house.. please go and buy.. instead of waiting.. if the prices really come down in the next 3 yrs.. it probably due to policies.. bubble collapsing... not yet.

Rather than a drop in home sales, financial would be more effective in dropping the home prices as home owners want to sell their property but nobody wanna buy, sure price drop but a drop in home sales foesnt guarantee much price drop cos owner still hold onto the property.

Rather than a drop in home sales, financial would be more effective in dropping the home prices as home owners want to sell their property but nobody wanna buy, sure price drop but a drop in home sales foesnt guarantee much price drop cos owner still hold onto the property. Anyway i was just kiddin, a financial crisis will make me starve to death too lol




Want to sell n need to sell r very different. If ppl dun need to sell, dun expect price drops.

So true, as long as employment holds up along with the current low rates, resale prices are to unlikely to fall. Pressure is mainly on new launches where developers need to clear inventories (SC Global is quite an exception though).
 

Recent measures only curbed the rising prices and sales; a real good measure would be one that brings house prices down to its knees just like the Cat B COE.

I think Mr B will be more interested to buy a second property, and not selling off the existing condo.

many sub-mkts are now priced crazily.. all signs of mkt imbalance and bubble brewing.
 

As for Dleedon, my own view is that they have broke even already so can afford to let go the remaining (and also harder to sell) units at a lower psf to quickly clear the stock.
 

I dun think they will be selling those units with good views for 12xx psf.

those are actually pretty ok units. my friends and my immediate family went to look.

But the large unit size and overall quantum didn't make sense for a DINK couple.

Once US unemployment go below 6.5%, there will be interest rate adjustment. Thats the only measure that will work, provided the rate hike is significant.

New private home sales fall sharply in February
 

SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes in Singapore fell sharply in February, due to the Lunar New Year holidays, fewer launches and the government's latest round of cooling measures.
 

However, analysts said it is still too early to gauge the effectiveness of the cooling measures introduced earlier this year.
 

According to data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority, 708 new units were sold during the month, down by almost 65 percent from January's 2,016 units.
 

..................
 

http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/sin...1260177/1/.html



 

708 units is still a very good number .
 

wait till the volume is below 300 for a few months in a row then can declare mkt slump haha

just dun be a fool.. to exit the mkt too earlier.. and force to enter into the mkt.. too late...
 

I think that what happened to alot of ppl...

they sell and rent....waiting for the mkt to crash...
 

Wait wait wait... until they realised that if they dun enter the mkt..they are running out of cash for rent/cov/downpayment/legal fee/agent fee...
 

The mkt now is artificially suppressed... there is not genuine reasons for the mkt to sell... like a bursting pipes, you will see small transactions but higher prices . 
 

It's still a seller mkt..so... those at the sideline.. dun be caught to buy at the peak. most likely in a 2 yrs time.. by then prices may have rose for another 10-20% due to the supply shortage... When it come down.. maybe 30%... those that bought last yr.. will still be smiling :)

our banks are in a strong position. hard to see a crash coming unlike in the old days where financing was pretty loose. the folks buying now really have the money.

I think HK follow US rates too.
 

But their government is more creative. I think they got the banks to increase their spread by implementing some more regulations on the banks.
 

Singapore government just waits for US rates to increase. That I think is dangerous. If US Rates increase causes a crash, it is very hard to cushion it.
 

It is better to try to increase not voluntarily so that we have some leeway if it crashes or prevent prices from going too high

as reported by the news, majority of the buyers are "investors" and i believe these property are not purchased for living in
 

$1M = $500K + $70K ABSD

$1.2M = $600K + $84K ABSD
 

assuming these are mature buyers at the age of at least 40 which means can only take 25 years loan to the max age of 65
 

their pocket is really really deep ... don't play play

After reading this... if MAS enforces this, I think those people relying on rental income can forget about any refinancing.
 

Example, if currently you rent your place out for 2k/month, your monthly installment is 2k/month so you happy right? Bank also loan you money, everyone happy.
 

With this new ruling, rental income is calulated based on 30% discount... so it ends up to be $1.4k. Of these $1.4k, you can only use 60% to finance your loan. That is like 0.84k. So they bank can only loan you up to 0.84k/monthly repayment.... Furthermore, you have to use medium term interest rate 3.5% to calculate repayment...
 

Anyway, the policy looks good. On second look, it will not affect the normal property owners much if they are not heavily leveraged. 60% of the income is quite high. 
 

Basically to sustain a 6k housing loan, your income needs to be 10k which is not too bad.
 

But if you are heavily leveraged with 12k/month housing loan (based on 3.5% interest rate..), your income needs to be 20k and rental income is reduced by 30%.

3.5% is used to compute loan amount and it is not the actual mortgage rate. This rule is meant for preventing buyers from over extending themselves.

that was history, now is AT LEAST 3.5%: point 6 from M@S announcement page: http://www.mas.gov.sg/news-and-publication...erty-loans.aspx
 

"6   The methodology for computing the TDSR will be standardised.  FIs will be required to:
 

take into account the monthly repayment for the property loan that the borrower is applying for plus the monthly repayments on all other outstanding property and non-property debt obligations of the borrower;

apply a specified medium-term interest rate or the prevailing market interest rate, whichever is higher, to the property loan that the borrower is applying for when calculating the TDSR;
 

3.5% for housing loans and 4.5% for non-residential property loans."

that was history, now is AT LEAST 3.5%: point 6 from M@S announcement page: http://www.mas.gov.sg/news-and-publication...erty-loans.aspx
 

"6   The methodology for computing the TDSR will be standardised.  FIs will be required to:
 

take into account the monthly repayment for the property loan that the borrower is applying for plus the monthly repayments on all other outstanding property and non-property debt obligations of the borrower;

apply a specified medium-term interest rate or the prevailing market interest rate, whichever is higher, to the property loan that the borrower is applying for when calculating the TDSR;
 

3.5% for housing loans and 4.5% for non-residential property loans."



 

methodology for computing the TDSR
 

NOT actual interest rate
 

comprehension fail

"apply a specified medium-term interest rate or the prevailing market interest rate, whichever is higher", in this case it says 3.5% for housing loans, so must apply minimum 3.5% right? 
 

u mean the methodology allows it 2 b below 3.5%? isnt that the current situation? then wat does this news mean?

In the computation of loan amount, 3.5% interest rate is used. The monthly repayment with 3.5% interest cannot exceed 60% of income. It has nothing to do with current interest rates.

ok understand now but the effect is d same coz it means d borrower cannot stretch out like last time liao. THis means bigger units may b affected again n MM or small units still can play...

people who use rental income to finance their housing loan lor.
 

A lot of people what. You think how people buy 2nd/3rd properties now??? interest rates are so low that it is a no brainer if the bank is willing to lend you.
 

Imagine your rental is 2k/month and loan repayment is 2k/month. Good deal right? at the end of 30 years, the house is yours. 
 

but now MAS basically outlawed such arrangement...

it is not to restrict pple from buying although the indirect effect has a discourage element. Those ABSD and raising LTV ratio are the ones that directly restrict pple from buying.
 

This one is to restrict pple from over leveraging. 
 

Many people are able to afford few properties at same time because they only pay the downpayment, and some uses rental to offset the loan. Also some uses "refinancing" on their current properties to get more cash to buy the next property.
 

With these rule, it is hard to leverage the bank money to buy few properties at the same time even if you can immediately rent out the moment you bought it.

This is still flawed. A conservative borrower could actually be penalized more as a result. Say he takes a short term loan for the car 1-2 years instead of the 5 (or longer if before the Feb measures), then the % is higher for him even though the exposure is shorter.

Yap. Bec client also has 40mil of commercial assets. 
 

Before this cooling measure, the 40-50% DSR is a good practice guideline for monthly income not exceeding 8k and low asset, low savings group. Its a different story for millionaire. Now its a black and white regulation so different story and game plan now. This new cooling measure not to curp the average Joe, but the well heeled to 2% who is rich and report low income.

J Gateway 734 units fully sold on preview day.



 

Jurong is a district with very few condos or private housing.

In recent years the prices of HdBs have also gone up quite a fair bit.

So it is very natural for these people who already have a life in that district to be going for a new condo in that same area so that their lives may continue with the least disturbance.

Another group is buying on the hype of rental yields near amenities and a new commercial hub, Yawn......
 

Prices are $1400 to 1800psf for a project with less then 10% of units being truly family size.

This means that the quantum of each unit is very within reach of the low end condo segment buyer.

The only people who are truly happy and in a nice position are the housing agents and developer 
 

Will the prices go up and people make money?  Sure there will always be some just as there will be some who will be begging the agents to return them their deposit in the next week or so.

Now the only loan i have left is an 80k car loan, which doesn't make sense to repay cos of the repayment penalties.

Comfortable yes. Rich? No.  Maybe 20m can consider rich.  Just right place right time.

 U have to remember that just 6 years ago(2006-2007) a suburban condo could be bought for $400- $500 psf. 

That was also the time when the financial industry was doing v well. So front line chaps like us were literally rolling in the dough. 25 year old 3rd year RMs were making 300k -400k a year. When I first started, the bank paid us 1% commission of the 4 %to 5% charged on unit trust sales.
 

Also because of  the restrictions that we faced if we were to invest the financial markets(my wife is a Corp M&A lawyer) almost no chioce but to buy property with the bonuses. My  first property was bought at a price of 500+ k. Which was sold last year for almost 1.2m. Which in my view is a completely ridiculous amount for a place which is 45mins from the CBD.

FFF rates shld increase 1Q14 IMO, n SG prop prices will continue their upward march as positive economic sentiment overwhelm funding concerns.
 

Give it awhile more until SIBOR is 3+% & pple continue buying at even higher prices at those rates, then i guess we r closer 2 d peak. Notice im not even mentioning d huge supply of units for rent next 3-4yrs. So if im right d perfect storm shld happen at d tail end of 3-4yrs time :)

$500k to $1.2mil , thats a great trade!

A guy in late 30s want to buy a 1M condo in suburban area. His pay is 5k after CPF. Downpayment 50% as 2nd property
 

assuming he taking 20 years loan, have an existing 80k hdb loan and 70k car loan, will the bank approve this guy? 
 

Taking into consideration that he wont sell his HDB



 
 
 

NOPE 
 
 

I can tell you and i am from cleaning services.
 

But a crook credit guy may let it slip through....guess who gets killed first when it screws.

Sibor is bound to increase should US rates start , chances are market are probably facing a correction in the upcoming months and it is likely to curb those poor from speculating but it doesn't make much of a diff to those who can pay in cash.




Thats only partially true. It will curb speculation from the man in the street, but even the rich will not buy or will wait on te sidelines if there is a negative expectation on prices. They can afford to pay doesn't mean they want to lose money.

In the long run, expectation of property prices is positive due to inflation. If you have millions in the bank and nothing to do with it, using it to buy property is your best bet against inflation. Look at what is happening in China today. BTW, the China home loan rate is more than 7%.

damn right u mnetion gold. by right if inflation was a big near term concern then gold shld chiong like mad now, but instead its crashed 30% recently. Thats coz gold was pushed up by central banks getting farked by falling US$, now that US$ is gona trend up all d central bankers r dumping. Look at SGDUSD, last yr 1.22 now 1.27, thats where d $$ went to.
 

Then u ask how come sg property still so damn far up? coz most property here r privately owned for own stay so no reason to dump. To me sg property also shot up coz of US$ crash, but instead of crashing so fast like gold, itll a long slog of a secular bear, which maybe in 6yrs time when analysts look at the URA PPI, only theyll say d actual secular property bear started around now.

From observing my clients, getting rich is really about riding the cycle, at least when investing. 

It really is "buying when everyone less is selling and selling when everyone is buying" like Warren Buffet. 
 

Sounds easy , but it goes against the base herd instinct that all of us have, that safety in numbers feeling. 

Probably left over from our evolutionary past, where it probably WAS safety in numbers. 
 

One of my clients loaded up on millions of various SG shares at the height of the Lehman crisis. OCBC at $5+, Suntec at $0.55 the list go on. 

I place trades i also scared. Even persuaded him to buy less.  

I bought so much that my dealers called me up to make sure i keyed the right trade. 

Obviously he's the one laughing to the bank now.

Totally agreed. You are definitely in the market to see the trends. 

US Fed already warned about turning off the taps of liquidity. 

Just a warning only market lost 10-15%.  

If actually turn off, not sure whats going to happen. 
 

The govt measures curb liquidity artificially. 

Like a dam trying to stem a tidal wave, sure still overflow one. 

What if the wave recedes? And the dam not removed fast enough?

From sea suddenly become desert?

I scared. Wait

Comfortable yes. Rich? No.  Maybe 20m can consider rich.  Just right place right time.

 U have to remember that just 6 years ago(2006-2007) a suburban condo could be bought for $400- $500 psf. 

That was also the time when the financial industry was doing v well. So front line chaps like us were literally rolling in the dough. 25 year old 3rd year RMs were making 300k -400k a year. When I first started, the bank paid us 1% commission of the 4 %to 5% charged on unit trust sales.
 

Also because of  the restrictions that we faced if we were to invest the financial markets(my wife is a Corp M&A lawyer) almost no chioce but to buy property with the bonuses. My  first property was bought at a price of 500+ k. Which was sold last year for almost 1.2m. Which in my view is a completely ridiculous amount for a place which is 45mins from the CBD.



 

25 year old RM can pull in 30M to 40M a year consistently on unit trust sales? 
 

possible with some powerful connections I guess...
 

unless poly grad or female or FT, 25 year old male university grad how to have 3 year experience?

You should ask , how much of those client he sold to actually made money.  
 

That said , i know of traders getting as much as 30% of aum/profits year after year. i know it is higher at prop shops but those money dont last

LOL. No need to believe me. Just ask around anyone who is in the industry. 

You don't really need 'powerful' connection to do 3m sales a month.  

Just hard work. 
 

In fact, for some, 3M sales volume just barely meet target only.

I think maybe you guys misunderstood?

3M per month refers to sales volume, not revenue..

3M  volume a month is only 150K volume per day, which is basically about 3 customers with 50K each?

Thats why i say its just hard work. 
 

Last time 3M can get 150K revenue. 

Now with internet portals, 3M only 60K-90K revenue, or even less. 

And for me 3M is only 30K revenue,  but i require a certain trade size from clients ..
 

I understand even the lowest ranked PFC nowadays revenue target start at 40K-50K

If purely only UT, 60-90K just pass only lei. 

For the more senior ones, its complete fail..

Yesterday ST while reporting the cooling measures also commented that it will have an effect on new sales and investors might have to buy overseas. Should we care whether investors cannot buy here? That there will be outflow of SGD to other countries? Personally I don't care, how many houses do we need? 1 house to stay should be enough. If you buy more, you drive up the price. If you want to invest, go overseas or invest in something else. Housing is basis need and our children should be able to afford one with reasonable price when they start working. I hope the govt can get the policy and priority right. Give us affordable housing.

The strength of SGD will weaken. Cos people, sell SGD buy other currency to invest. 

Or foreign investor stop buying SGD to invest in our houses. 
 

Meaning you go holiday, buy imported things, could be more expensive, but good for economy, because we get cheaper (relatively), in terms of salary etc.   

But FX too many other factors to consider.

Yeah this reminds me of a personal story which happened quite a long while ago.  
 

Was in some private function and was introduced to some friends of friends.

So we were chatting and invariably the job topic came up and one of the girls no more than 25yrs of age proudly presented herself as a Banker.   So we talked a bit and realised what she meant was she is a salesgirl in a bank and not a banker.   In the course of that evening i probably spoke to more than half a dozen of "bankers"
 

The moral of this story is that in today's world titles and positions are so blatantly used, the value of having one has greatly diminished.  Your neighborhood friendly table wiper, i remain.

Thats very true.
 

Everytime a bank sales consultant introduce me to a new bank product,
 

I always ask them if they bought any themslves and they always say no.
 

I feel so sad these people are only destined to only be poor sales people

To be fair, not all people know how to invest or have the knowledge or experience to invest. 
 

Some want to invest but do not have much capital so buy those unit trust or ILP from insurance company or banks.  
 

And what makes them so sure that they invest themselves will sure make $ ?? Some maybe is those low risk type, so go for safe option. 
 

So there are many combinations of why people do certain things that normal people don't understand, but what matter the most is these people know what they are doing can already.

Khaw Boon Wan: New rules on property loans "quite permanent"
 

The tougher rules on home loan financing are expected to be permanent and are a "structural measure" to ensure a more stable property market, Minister for National Development Khaw Boon Wan said on Sunday.
 

"So it's not really a cooling measure as such, but it's a measure which will be quite permanent," said Mr Khaw on the sidelines of the launch of the Sembawang GRC Memory Project at Fuchun Community Club. "It's a structural measure which is good to ensure a more stable property market.
 

"The current low interest rates are not sustainable, and we worry that people buy beyond their means."
 

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced on Friday that banks have to use a standardised set of guidelines to assess property buyers' ability to borrow. Banks will not be able to approve a loan if the monthly repayments of a buyer's total debt obligations exceed 60 per cent of his gross monthly income

Khaw Boon Wan: New rules on property loans "quite permanent"
 

The tougher rules on home loan financing are expected to be permanent and are a "structural measure" to ensure a more stable property market, Minister for National Development Khaw Boon Wan said on Sunday.
 

"So it's not really a cooling measure as such, but it's a measure which will be quite permanent," said Mr Khaw on the sidelines of the launch of the Sembawang GRC Memory Project at Fuchun Community Club. "It's a structural measure which is good to ensure a more stable property market.
 

"The current low interest rates are not sustainable, and we worry that people buy beyond their means."
 

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced on Friday that banks have to use a standardised set of guidelines to assess property buyers' ability to borrow. Banks will not be able to approve a loan if the monthly repayments of a buyer's total debt obligations exceed 60 per cent of his gross monthly income

I will never get to own a second property in my life



 

You can always buy your 2nd property in other countries.
 

Why do you have to restrict yourself to Singapore?

Yeah this reminds me of a personal story which happened quite a long while ago.  
 

Was in some private function and was introduced to some friends of friends.

So we were chatting and invariably the job topic came up and one of the girls no more than 25yrs of age proudly presented herself as a Banker.   So we talked a bit and realised what she meant was she is a salesgirl in a bank and not a banker.   In the course of that evening i probably spoke to more than half a dozen of "bankers"
 

The moral of this story is that in today's world titles and positions are so blatantly used, the value of having one has greatly diminished.  Your neighborhood friendly table wiper, i remain.

30% of Net Profit before Tax or Income?
 

No banks pay that kind of % to prop traders.. only hedge funds do due to its structure.
 

maybe you are talking about 20 years ago..back in 90's, maybe...



 

Not sure why you are asking net profit or income , it is always after cost , tax is dependent on the structure in which each organization is different?  Dude , typical star traders are earning those amounts 20~30% depending on port size and track record . Now most banks are downsizing their own trading departments or reducing them so many switched to hedge funds.
 

Even a junior trader might be earning 10~15% depending.
 

Back in the 90s it is up to 50% on some cases.

Thats very true.

Everytime a bank sales consultant introduce me to a new bank product,

I always ask them if they bought any themslves and they always say no.

I feel so sad these people are only destined to only be poor sales people

and not multi-millionaire investors as they do not have any foresight to see

how wondeful these new financial products are.

To be fair, not all people know how to invest or have the knowledge or experience to invest. 
 

Some want to invest but do not have much capital so buy those unit trust or ILP from insurance company or banks.  
 

And what makes them so sure that they invest themselves will sure make $ ?? Some maybe is those low risk type, so go for safe option. 
 

So there are many combinations of why people do certain things that normal people don't understand, but what matter the most is these people know what they are doing can already.



 

5 years ago, uncle was queuing at the bank to renew the fixed deposit
 

got 1 pretty xmm banker came and talked to uncle
 

she said she had a product like fixed deposit but got insurance and guaranteed paid higher interest 
 

so uncle put the money supposedly for fixed deposit with the xmm banker since banks will never cheat uncle money
 

but now uncle go and withdraw the money, uncle doesn't know why it is lesser than the original amount
 

so uncle called the bank but they told uncle the xmm banker was promoted and no longer working there
 

they said will recommend another banker to advise uncle
 

this time another xmm banker called and said uncle should buy another product
 

this product guaranteed won't lose money, but interest maybe a bit lower
 

so uncle put all of the reduced amount of money into this new product
 

5 years later uncle should be able to get back all the money

Those young people are the ones taking over crap due to the fact that their predecessors did plenty of bad and they are continuing with the crap in order to join their ranks. I would say karma would eventually fall upon those which sell unscrupulously to those which trust them with their hard earned money. 
 

That said , those that are genuinely good and take care of their clients would get richer than those crooked ones eventually and by a high margin as reputation and results show. The "hardworking" ones would always have the pie early in their years , i doubt they are doing as well as time goes . 
 

Smug? Just ask them what is their investment track record year on year , many of these so called bankers can't trade or invest for s--t. Less to say analyze the market and advise their clients accordingly. If you can't make money from your own investments what makes one think he is able to give good advice?

Don't what/ how to invest so buy ILPs?
 

Thats a screwed-up reason to buy into an ILP and let the insurance companies leech on your investment funds every year. 
 

The only thing you can be sure of abt ILP or even participating whole life policy is the insurance company will charge you the fee every fxxking single year regardless if the money in your ILP or participating whole life policy made any real returns after accounting for inflation.
 

But those who keep insisting they don't know but don't want to learn...deserve getting ripped off.

Hahaha , nah some very SL one , i will do my part to wake their idea. No difficult to dig info from them , since that is my job nature. Ask a simple question , they recommend me to buy something highly so how much of their fortune did they invest in? The next question is , is that all they have?? If the product is so good how come they have so less money???

If they cannot approve 1c of the bank's monies to be loaned or decide the interest rate the customer is to be charged, what kind of banker are they?

As compared to buying ILP i rather put my money in cpf special account . Tax reduction plus high compounding interest.  You basically double your money within 20 years and if you include the consistent amounts you add to it. Basically i find it hard to find investments which can match. Problem is only whether if you can survive to see the lights of it.

By the way, never ask a "banker" whether their product is the best, instead look up the other banks to compare what they offer , due diligence is important , falling for one's showmanship would only result in investments which are likely to fail.
 

Anyway back to property . Looking forward , though property prices are unlikely to drop sharply but it is likely that there won't be much liquidity in the secondary markets as the ones holding on to their properties are unlikely to sell them. Unless one or two of the things below happen 
 

1. Sharp hikes in interest (sibor rates)

2. Economic downturn resulting to mass corrections in multi asset classes

3. Sudden withdrawals of foreign investments from Singapore

4. War

5. Over supply of properties due to various reasons ( bankrupted developers/investors etc )

I don't believe Boonie is so caring. They just don't want so many ppl to buy property and sit on their rentals.
 

if they really don't want ppl to buy beyond their means, then make property cheaper la! why invite 6.9mil to keep raising prices? Politician talk...but anyway, ppl tend to believe it. 
 

btw, u still can own 2nd property, just not in SG

hahaha i have d answer for u: Singapore Dollar. It all leads back to how its set.
 

Currently its too strong, so to reduce its value, they cant have high CPI, so they keep COE n prop prices in check so they can adjust Sing Dollar to boost exports, which is like sh!t now...

Naive answer , the reason why property markets is at such high prices due to speculative investors , how do you in a free market reduce prices? I believe , the current measure is good as it forces people to buy within their means and should markets correct itself , there would be lesser tragedies and if you think that is not caring , please come out with a better measure rather that shoot off without any better ideas. In the event of a property collapse , the banks would eventually run of money to lend and bussinessman are likely to suffer. Keeping liquidity would meant keeping everyone employed. If it was up to me , I would have suggested another enforced saving of 10% for every 10% reduction to the maximum % of debt repayment. 
 

Say all politician talk , I don't see how caring you are by shooting off. As for the 6.9mil it is used to increase to generate more income to cover their arses for the series of failed investments they made in recent years . If one actually bothers to keep a record of what they write on papers , the losses would probably be in the access of 100 bil and they have being busy selling other assets which they have held for decades to "cover" for it. It is just a matter of time before they run out of assets to sell and before that happens they will need more income to smoothen their failures . I might be wrong , let just hope we have a well balanced government which probably has two equally capable parties which are able to keep our country transparent and yet work together to a better future.
 

To the ruling party , my suggestion is start thinking of how to work in a two party state , people are not impressed with what and how things are being handled and our current leaders are deem to be too engrossed in petty cat fights to be planning our future. No plans to tap on each others talents and abilities and not try to work together to improve singapore , there is no way a leader or the party that has No clear 10 year or 20 years forecast be able to impress me irregardless what they say , I cant seem to know why do we need these amount of people if not for the reasons I state

The 4 year seller stamp duties prevent speculation. Ppl are investing rathet than speculating. As for a solution, a population reduction is a good first step. It will make this place more livable too. Btw, appreciate if u can leave personal flaming out of this.

Dude , I don't see how you aren't going personal by calling one first by names and second claims he is uncaring without substantiating your claims and yet refuses others to question you on it claiming it is flaming. Why the double standards ? I would also appreciate you do what you say first .
 

For the credit point of view I don't see how the stamp duty is enough to curb speculatation for something which was meant as a basic necessity , 4 years isn't a long time for many fund managers and speculators alike , while you claim reduce population yet insist on rental , I don't really see how it tallies if everyone here has a roof of their own who is goin rent from who? By the way , who is going to pay for the overly paid property agents who job is to get clients to "flip" their property to enrich themselves ?
 

Now that this measure is here , I don't see how this is going to be bad ? If there is cap to how much one can afford a house what makes you think a FT would be able to afford the same property without any income ?  It would also limit the appeal for foreigners to come into Singapore solely for investment and it is likely the ones which intends to stay would be contributing to our economy one way or another.

I feel what KBW said is correct. 
 

It is to protect people interest and also economy
 

Look at what happen in year 2008 recession on housing market .
 


  

4.45mins to 5.15mins 
 

Some sort of similar, so SG lesson learn from US to prevent moral hazard. 
 

Imagine too many people over-borrow and earn $ through rental and what happen when too much supply and low demand when market decline?? 
 

It will crash the whole property market and it not only affect property but also whole financial initiation if too much $ is lend to people who over-borrow to buy many property ( a lot will default on payment when their rental income is not enough to cover for the rise in interest rate, suddenly no rental income due to bad economy, lose job etc. ) . 
 

Although I feel it is still a bit too late to put brakes on it as it should have been done a lot earlier. But well it's still not too late to save a lot more people who was thinking to earn $ through over-borrow to buy property and earn $ through rental or waiting for property to appreciate and sell off at even higher price.

TO sum up, property now is a rich man game, those who does not have much capital, better live by their own means and just don't join in the rich man game as when market crash, rich or super rich people will not be that much affected as they still got lots of $$, but for those who do not have that much cash?? By than they want blame government ?? Cannot be right?? As they made decision to chiong with the rich man game hoping to get rich also. Well, some maybe able to tide the wave and get rich, but some maybe unlucky and end up sink into even deeper debt.

Personally if it was up to me , I would have recommended to up the stamp duty to at least 20% on sold price of PRs buying Hdb on permanent basis or the stamp duty being the difference between what they paid for and what they sold. Reason being , if pr can hold their pr for so long might as well become a citizen .
 

Since this suggestion solely aimed at PR which come here to flip properties .

try telling that to d asian millionaires in 1996 n theyll tell u sky will never fall on their heads. So many millionaires became bankrupt during asian financial crisis.
 

Now that nobody is even talking abt an asian crisis proves to me that complacency is building up. As to when another big crash happens nobody knows, just b diversified to capture up n downside.
 

Poor guys become rich if they have discipline. Even rich can become poor, if they mismanage newly created wealth.

yes, the govt may legislate that all private residential to be purchased with cash only. This is to prevent prices from creeping back up
 
meanwhile HDB will ramp up supply of new flats to 50,000 a year from 2015 to 2020
 
combine this with oil crisis, eurozone fiscal issues and china credit bubble, we will expect to see a drop in price of 18% before 2017

Ok can , haha . Just remind the many here which likes to point fingers without thinking that there is at least another 3 pointing back back them.
 
I just don't like it when they claim they did this this and this when their post states the obvious opposite. There is the a difference in changing of stance and claiming what they did when didn't.

 
just like what Prata Keynes said
 
when my information changes, i alter my conclusions

https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/built-more-hdb-flats-pm-lee-055357915--sector.html
 
In a recent television interview, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said one of his greatest regrets in his ten years as Prime Minister involves Singapores public housing.
 
 
"In retrospect, it's easy to say that we should have been building up our infrastructure a lot faster; that we should have got our trains running; that we should have got our HDB flats built more, he said.
 
 
"At that time, we thought we were doing the right thing, pacing it, measuring it out, building it when we needed it and not spending resources until we needed to spend them. It turned out that things didn't pan out the way we expected and I think in the future, we have to plan in future less conservatively, and try to be less precise in our prognostications.
 
 
From 2011 to 2013, HDB ramped up its building programme to build an average of 26,000 new HDB flats per year, and the 2014 BTO flat supply plan showed HDB started to transit to a more sustainable phase.

I have been posting a a few warnings between 2011 to 2012, the property market about to correct. But many replied no worries, becasue of the 6.9mil magic word. I have sold my CityLights around end 2011, and there's where the peak was. So, now it finally happened and is just the start. So... finally those who had shot me down earlier and go ahead the buying have now caught. 
 
So now, I will wait for the te market to meaningfully corrected, before I start investing with this cash-pile.

I dunno the peak or not peak but i exited quite early in 2013 and missing the "peak" but i have no regrets as i made money.
 
I only think it this way , i realised my profits and sit on them as cash , whatever that happens on the market has nothing to do with me. Being many years in credit makes me realise that money goes in cycles same for investments. One just need to observe and study the trend.
 
I will only start buying when everyone here is bleedly money and when defaults are at the heights where even the banks are crying foul. Not yet , at least 1~2 more years before it happens , meanwhile i continue to troll here.
 
Plenty of shifters here. (or is it shitters) They randomly read things and suddenly tell the world they have done this this and this as if they know everything and done everything right only to eat their own words.

If they sold in 2012 it was the peak.
 
If they sold in 2013 it was the peak.

Or do you mean market peaked at end 2011
 
Your gap from end 2011 to 2014 is kinda wide leh.....even considering the lag in physical market price movements

I think what they are trying to say is when they sell their property, they are selling at the right time and at highest or near to highest price at that point of time? 
 
Peak or no peak, if you buy at near peak and sell at peak, can also self-praise abit? Haha

Peak or no peak, if you sell your extra house, it should be fine. Some sell and start renting house since 2011 and now shoudl pay out 100k to rental and still waiting for market to correct. That why you see alot of the want house price to fall 50% if not cannot cover the rental lost.

Good timing bro, congrats... any chance you give us a heads up when the trough is about to be hit ?  Thanks!

 
Bro, I am no guru of properties, but sample common sense for making money in all investments that I follow closely. First, scanning for red flags :
 
1. Record-breaking prices
2. Chasing prices rising beyond their affordability so they buy a property .
3. Owner Occupiers buying lower price quantum units at high PSFs due to perceived “affordability”. (This refer to Shoebox homes)
4. Speculators bank on prices rising at the same rate as in the past.
5. Properties have negative cash flows and low rental yields.
6. Net Rental Yields are below the inflation rate.
7. Professional investors stay out of the market. Owner-occupiers and speculative investors remain core buyers.
8. Property cooling measures are implemented to curb further property price increases.
 
The point 8 is the most important one, that one have to watch of. If you are looking to buy property for investment , here is my 2 cents :
 
1. Buyers are unwilling to buy and force prices down further.
2. Significant double-digit decline in prices.
3. Match property market against rental yield. After deduction of all maintenance, tax ,loans and etc, and still gain positive yield.
4. Removal of property cooling measures.
5. Peaking interest rates and start to fall.
6. Not many mention buying property which is now considered a stupid thing to do.
7. The lower end of the market plummets due to lack of interest.
8. Repossessions are gaining momentum.
 
As mentioned, I not clever in timing the market. You just have to leave some money on the table. You will never know who is the next greater fools. Besides the CityLights, I have also sold my Malaysia property for RM1.43mil last year, which I bought it for only RM362k 7 years ago.
 
Hope this help you and the rest. Patience is the key to all investments. Meantime, I will wait while the cash put into other better investments which have beaten down.

Bro, just leave some money for greater fools. The peak I mentioned is general. When everyone is not aware, there is peak or new peak. The peak is just an indication of prices about to fall. The bull market can go longer. I am not guru in property investments, I just don't know when is the last train.

To all,
I am not try to prove that I right on this. All you need is to look out of red flags, which were pretty obvious for the last few years. One more red flag, Cheap money for too long. This means interest rate will only move up. For those who had caught in this cycle, do buffer enough to service loans that may hit 4% to 5% interest rate for the next few years. Every 0.5% increase is a big thing for big ticket item like this.
 
P/S : For those who are interested, do look back my previous posted in 2012 on property.  Let those old posts say it all.

Peak or no peak, if you sell your extra house, it should be fine. Some sell and start renting house since 2011 and now shoudl pay out 100k to rental and still waiting for market to correct. That why you see alot of the want house price to fall 50% if not cannot cover the rental lost.Dont play with primary residence.  If want to play must also be more zhun lahThose who sold primary residence in 2011 only to rent have gotten it wrong.

In the past, buying a house is purely for a place to stay. Nowadays due to propaganda that buying property is a good investment tool that people now overlooks the fundamentals. A lot people just want to listen to positive words and reject what is negative. However,  the truth is often those negative words or things are the most truth as compared to those who always project positive feedback/words that want to cover up what is negative. 
 
Remember what causes the 2008 economic crisis? I keep emphasise on this on this forum and to the government to make sure people always remember this and not to repeat the same mistake USA does. It's very scary you know that piror to big crash in 2007/2008, those so call experts still say it's under control and it's only contain in the sub-prime market. They talk until so positive that USA will not face so deep recession... But look what happened after that? Somewhat this is what I am afraid of seeing it to repeat here in Sg. We seems to be moving into this denial direction. Forget about banks and financial institutions, no matter market good or bad, they only will project positive image and paint a very rosey picture. They will never tell the truth, some worst, don't even know thuderstorm is coming. The banks main focus is KPI, so much so that they may neglect on fundemdals. Government also quite slow to implement policies, as we know sometimes for policy is pass through need at least 6 months duration. Just look at the jover chew at sim lim case. The government already admit it that it may take sometime for them to make changes to the policy. Its a joke man, I do hope that government to always remember, banks are there only for 1 thing KPI because of cheap $, they are drown by cheap $.  Like I mentioned before if government never step in on tdsr,  I think today property prices maybe much higher or tge bubble already burst. Do banks care about fundemdals?  No! If they do why they keep lowing their lending standard,  lucky government step in and thus they no choice.  It's really very sad that banks here never learn the lesson on what cause the 2008 financial crisis and were to repeat here in Sg. 
 
Though now is much under control due to government step in a lot to stop banks from being reckless, the crash is still unavoidable as sg economy is very much affected by global economy. Recently more and more bad news are appearing, we need to gear for big impact.

Hopefully would like to see that in future, the selection critical for banks CEO is to have very strong economic fundamentals and dare to point out negative things and sharp to differentiate between what is being perceive as a positive image but actually things are not that good. To me we need people like Peter schiff, Jim Rogers, those that have very deep economic fundamentals and not afraid to say negative things that people do not like to hear but that's the truth. If not singapire future will be ruined by lack of strong economic fundamentals on the banks.

Just listen to him. He sum up things so well in just 3 minutes and have so good economic fundamentals. Do we have such people in our government? Not much, perhaps lky,lsl,tharman.. The rest?? Just listen to the way the rest speak, some are just darn bad that includes those in opposition party. They don't understand economic fundamentals at all. If our leader only less then 50% fully understand economic fundamentals, how will they going to implement good polices that will benefit singapore in the long run? Do financial institutions' CEOS have strong economic fundamentals?

Those who sold primary residence in 2011 only to rent have gotten it wrong.

 
sold in 2011 wrong?
 
so your reading is that prices will not drop to 2011 levels anytime soon?

i'd say the thunderstorm is not so much of SG compared to the kinda crap ppl buy in JB, Camdodia, Yangon etc etc.. and to certain extent, even UK, australia, Japan
 
NOne of these are regulated by MAS
 
In the past that was fine as only usually wealthy ppl buy such properties. These past 2-3 yrs, many mom and pop have purchased such condo with their life savings.. so... i dont know what to say  

while driving this morning ... listen to radio ... and all the analyst agree that "hot money" will be flowing to asia because only asia can generate "high returns" now ... huat ah!!!
 
 

 
wow after 2008 flow to asia
 
then flight to safety in 2012 cos asia over value
 
then now back again to asia?
 
wonder when will hot money just evaporate to outer space cos no where else in the world to invest in

as an outsider he can say what he wants
 
but if he is in the game, he won't be saying the same things anymore
 
just like people here complain about govt policies and have many good ideas to change them to improve citizens' lives
 
but they would gladly take up the minister salary and be a yes man if they are given the opportunity

What he said is partially true, but he looks at Europe in isolation.  Cheaper Euro means making European labours more competitive and thus more export for European (gaining market shares from Asia, US etc),
 
Of course the Europeans have to work harder to maintain same standard of living (no more long 2-month summer vacation, no more 30 hrs work week), to buy the same basket of goods.  Life has been overly good for them.
 
And QE has proven to work for the US, the Europeans are just copying an US idea.
 
Hot money may flow to US instead of coming to Asia though, as USD will continue to strengthen and it is the only bright spark in the world economy at this moment.
 
Long USD/Short Euro anyone?

Forget to add not all leaders are bad. There are some is good like LSS, he keep emphasise on certain issues that make good economic sense but always been shoot down by general public. Its very difficult when people do not see how it would actually benefit the general public in long run. One of it is the salary restructure programme that he keep pushing for greater work efficiency then just setting miminum wages. People just do not see it and thought he talking rubbish, but setting miminum wages will cause higher unemployment in long run. People just do not see it that way sad.

Yewheng. That's very wise insight and is real.
 
Singapore household debt to GDP is now 77.2% (All time high). This is alraming !! Previously is US, and now it swings back to Asia. This falls back to MAS policy on tightening. They know things are about to go very wrong. This is the biggest red flag.
This is not just Singapore. Is now , an Asia problem. As Yewheng mentioned, gear up for the worst. It's really a bad news for the next few years.

Almost all forum are talking a gov this and gov that. That's common. But there are many opportunities to captialize and make money , rather the complaining. We live in a capitalistic society. So make full use of it. There is money to be made if you follow closely those policies made. This are all publicly avaliable information. Don't hope the world will change for our good. One can action to realise it.

"Millionaires" ?   Sure .......most households are anyway.
Go to MarkLi's profileMarkLi1 post
Hello Guys, I think this seminar could help you with the cooling measure. I mean we will be having our free seminar about Real Estate Agents who want to be top producers in the industry.
 
Last 2 Jan 2014, Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (PDPA) implemented the Do Not Call (DNC) provisions, which generally prohibit organizations from sending out certain marketing messages to Singapore telephone numbers. This includes mobile, fixed-line, and residential and business numbers which are registered with the DNC Registry.
 
However, while this provision poses a challenge to property agents that are looking to exhaust all possible methods in order to acquire leads, it is still possible to flourish in the Singapore real estate market as a property agent—you just need the right tools to work around with.
 
Utilizing technology for the benefit of your career in real estate is a matter of being open to new trends in marketing, especially that of the digital kind. Potentials clients are, more often than not, searching for property projects and listings online, which is where your visibility is highly crucial. The agents’ websites and social media platforms, such as Facebook and LinkedIn, are the most relevant digital tools that these cream of the crop agents are using. Believe it or not, top agents of 2014 have been using this technique to reach the height of their careers.
 
Basically, for existing students, the Free Agent Training Website will be held on April 6,8 and 10.
For interested students, they can avail the FREE Training Session on the 30th of March.
 
For both events, they need to register first by contacting us at 6423-0155 or emailing us at sales@youfirstdigital.com
 
 

 
 
Hope to see you there guys!

	No subletting of HDB industrial properties from June 1

AsiaOneMonday, Mar 30, 2015

SINGAPORE - From June 1 this year, new and existing tenants of Housing and Development Board (HDB) industrial properties will not be allowed to sublet their industrial properties, the HDB said in a statement on Monday.
Tenants with existing approved subletting arrangements will be allowed to renew their subletting agreements up to Dec 31, 2017. This is to give them time to make business adjustments.
Thereafter, they will not be allowed to sublet their properties.
HDB said the revised policy will better support industrialists in operating their core business by promoting more responsible and productive use of scarce industrial land.
HDB also added that tenants who are currently subletting their premises to their wholly-owned subsidiaries or related companies will not be affected by this policy revision, and may continue their subletting arrangement.
HDB manages close to 12,000 industrial properties island-wide, including workshops, warehouses and factories. About 98 per cent are rented out on one-, two- or three-year term tenancies.
Currently, tenants of HDB industrial properties are allowed to sublet up to 50 per cent of their factory floor space.
About 380 tenants, or about 3 per cent, of the total number of tenants, are currently subletting space in their industrial properties.

Hard to believe HDB came out with a rule just to target this 3%. How much space do they own anyway? 30%?

pre-emptive... with the economy slowdown, many SME will face over capacity and other business challenges, and will likely to sublease out for additional income, mostly to non-industrial users.
 
HDB may want to take back those units, maybe to lease to newer businesses.

So it have been ahile since my last post on early this year. Let's see how the property market fair today. Just a slight correction of around 5 - 7% from peak. It is still high compare as most most Property Loan/household income still range from 45% - 70%. That does not even include other personal or car loan. A meaningful correction should be aleast 15 - 25%.
 
Here there is amountain of cash after I sold 2 properties back in late 2011 and mid 2012.  awaiting for an opportunistic buy. Still have time wait.

Dear Throttle, as mentioned on my previous post. One just have to leave some money on the table for better fools. I don't know when the property market is about to correct. For sure, the past few years of tightning policies are already a RED flag to me. Besides this, after the 2011 GE, ppl already making hell lots of noise on immigration policies. If you look the real mirrors, there are tons of RED flags telling investors to be careful. And I have wrote that before in 2012.
The mountain of cash from the 2 divested properties, can buy city fringe 3 rooms condo and a 2 rooms outer core region in local pricwe of today. These divestment have surpassed my equity investments by 1.5 times.
 
The moral of this story is, you never knows the peak. If all knows the peak, there will be no peak.
