I got my condo unit renovated, and i water proof the whole house (unit below me requested). After installing oak plank in the bed room. the oak plank warp! when they remove the solid plan. it found water drop on the surface of the cement floor. That is to say. the moisture unable to escape as it was trap between water proof and timber floor.
 

I even let the cement floor cure 3 weeks before i install! 1.5 weeks after 2nd installation. it start to warp again! :(
 

tis was a pre finish oak floor and need not lacquer again. any expert out there can help? 
 

does letting the cement floor cure a longer time then install again will help?... or....
 

install it. let it warp and sand down to re-lacquer again to solve the problem. ....Since I cant and no way i can remove the water proof under the cement floor.

Oak is not a tropical wood, and it's only natural that it behaves differently compared to tropical woods like teak. 
 

Sounds like u are using the oak wood on level 1 of a landed property?
 

The ground is moist, and overtime moisture will penetrate through the concrete slab. 

This is not uncommon, that's why.. have to use materials that has high resisteance to moisture absorption.

You water-proof your house???
 

That means water/moisture cannot enter and cannot escape from your house also!

Possible to have water seeping to the floor from wall, window, ceiling, etc? Water can travel quite far and from the most 'unlikely' places.

High chance its from the water seepage since you mentioned its extensive.

Engineered wood (Pergo) installation includes a plastic sheet layover before installation of the timber planks so perhaps you can explore that option. Real wood parquet floor is always a b i t c h to maintain. Cannot be too wet. Scratches easily. Must polish and buff periodically. Damn pain in the a s s.

2 possibilities:
 

i) water seepage thru the external walls into the floor (this one jialat liao....)

ii) the parquet not properly cured (assuming u switch on a/c and dry air can accelerate the warping)
 

solution: sell the place.

Same concept lah. Parquet is real wood as well.

Long planks are more susceptible to warping. Either you change to short ones or to engineered wood

The real problem is not with the length of timber...but possible water seepage. So try getting to the root cause...which may not be easy.

long planks are more prone to warping. 
 

but honestly, u gotta fix the root of the problem. even if u somehow solve the timber floor warping, water seepage problem still there and moisture will find other ways to escape. land up the house may could get mouldy and u could land up wif other heath associated problems.

dehumidifier will not solve the root cause but slow down the issue. sometime water can seep in through wall during rainy day or even condensation due to aircon from the lower floor. To solve these type of issue which technically cannot be solved will be to use tiles instead of laminate or wood. 
 

on slightly colder weather or when the unit below blast their aircon, you may see condensation on the tile flooring.

Wood flooring moves around with moisture.  Unavoidable really.  And it moves around the growth rings which is why trees/trunks are cut in a particular way to make planks.  Also why longer planks more susceptible to warping compared to smaller planks.
 

It could be a case of too much moisture in the wood, or not enough.

it is possible that there is water seeping into your floor from some other source, perhaps even some other unit.  cos your whole floor is waterproofed, the water might have pooled underneath.  this wouldnt be the first time im hearing of it.

Sigh... So.... if really want to have timber floor plank.
 

1. small hack current cement bed to allow a marine ply of 12mm. let the marine to take the hit from the moisture below? so my timber floor may not affected. will it work? (just talked to my contractor and he suggested that.)
 

2. re-hack the floor where the timber floor is to bedroom. remove the water proof. screed new cement bed. let it cure like for 2 weeks. before new timber goes in. I really like the oak floor. :(
 

if all options fail and the above 2 options will kick in.

moist is not good for health and fengshui, you either redo the whole flooring or move to another room   [:/]

Floorboards expand when its humid and contract when its dry. The key to maintaining wooden flooring is to ensure a consistent level of humidity. This is not easy so the next best step is to minimise the fluctuations.
 

If you regularly turn on your aircon, do remember to open the window the next day to air the room. Some people turn on their aircon at high settings and seldom open the windows for external ventilation regularly. This would mean the air inside the house/room would be drier than what's outside. So when the environment is suddenly subjected to a change in humidity, the floor boards will warp over time.
 

As for the water found on the cement, where did you find it? Is it near the external walls? If yes, it might be from water seepage from rain. If no, then it could be condensation loh. The goal is now is to find the water source, fix that and then maintain consistent humidity.

I bought this to clean up the air in my hse.... buy one if u fear health issues....
 

If u observed condensation, it may not necessary be water seepage but aircon below ur neighbour place blasted at full power or it was blasting at the ceiling...sometimes u hv some weird neighbours that do that...  
 

U cannot prevent wood from expanding due to our local weather... I had this problem, found condensation on my floor, water seeping from external wall, mould eaters running all over my ceilings n walls.... water seepage was resolved w damage of cos.... 
 

Brought in Pest control and air quality expert.... Pest said no solution...air quality will tell u buy dehumidifier.... At the end, I can tell u still cannot solve the problem...jus open window air ur house when u r around.... I got to give up my aquarium....bcos this is one of the cause as well....
 

If it is not a seepage, get a dehumidifer n  a air purifier....I think this novita air purifier is currently one of the best I hv seen....I turn it on 24/7 and it is quite compact n coverage up to 1200 sqft if i didnt remember wrongly...
