Just want to gather feedback about the sequence of the AGM agenda.
 
The AGM I attend, usually the Proposed budget and monthly contributions is approved before the election of the incoming council members. Is this logical, or should the elections be conducted before the proposed budget is discussed?
 
If the approved budget is unusually low, then any incoming council member will have a very hard time operating with a tight budget. This is a major deterent to be a council member. But if the elections are conducted as the first few items of the agenda, then the incoming council members will take on more "ownership" of the proposed budget debate. Isn't this more of  a logical sequence?
 
Care to share any insights on the best MCST AGM sequence?

I was on the MCST 
 
I don't think it matters
 
Unless you can tell me that the incoming council has get time to meet and create a budget before presenting it - no matter what, they will have to work with what's given. 
 
In any case - it's always a challenge to get people to stand for MCST council.

Is the approved budget at MCST even binding in the first place? Not all quotations will be in before AGM and for many of them the final prices could be way higher few months down the road. Should the MC then call EOGMs for every single item where there is no choice but for the budget to be increased , failing which no security guards , no cleaners , etc. Of course not. Treat the budget approved as a guide and do not fear it being exceeded down the road as long as can justify increase at next AGM, if questioned.
my MCST full of shiet ppl
MCSTs are mostly filled up with self-interested individuals or those that need to boost their egos.

My mcst has a lot of hu lan par ..... most of them are there with their own agenda.
 
Unless something drastic ... I usually cant be bothered
 
Ts .....if u want to know more about mcst i suggest that you read up the act and you  will know your rights as a SP. The mc also cannot do anything they want but they have to follow the guidelines stipulated in the act.

From the proposed budget, the MA proposed the contributiion amt per share value. Some SP say too high and eventually was passed at a reduced rate. 
 
Anyone with a common sense will know that come tail end of the year, the mcst will hv cashflow problems. Good luck to the incoming council members. MCST dont hv credit facilities. 
 
I later found out why some SP wanted a low contribution. They were planning to sell their investment property very soon.
 
But in other Condo AGM, do elections come before the budget discussions?

Usually elections are after budget discussions but no strict rule on this.
 
If Maintenance Funds run short, can take from Sinking Fund (if got enough) or call for EOGM to ask for lump sum deduction. If still do not want to approve if no more money to operate  then stop cleaners, remove security guards and I bet they will approve any sum overnight.
 
People are generally short sighted and self-centered. You will be surprised with the kind of people staying in condos. AGMs serve as  is a good wake up call on the kind of neighbours you have.

First & Foremost, Building Maintenance & Strata Management Act is silent on the sequence of the Agenda Items. It is rather common for the Agenda on Contribution Rate for Management & Sinking Fund to be in the first few Items after review of the Audited Report for the last FY.
However should most SPs are agreeable, they can requested at the General Meeting for that Agenda Items to be delay till after election of Council.

There is a basis to determine the contribution rate based on the forecast of contract sum (varies depending on requirements for various services), repairs & replacement for the forthcoming year. However, I must share that different group of SPs may share different opinions on the figure due to their own interest and most do not bother about the big picture. 
 
In event that the Management Fund Contribution Rate approved is lower, it us deem as a deficit budget and any deficit in that FY will be funded out from the Accumulated Management Fund. You cannot utilise Fund from the Accumulated Sinking Fund.
 
Strictly speaking, the MC should work within the approved budget but the practical approach will be to treat that as a deficit budget and handle any eventual deficit as described above.
 
In my opinion, it is important to ensure that the approved budget is sufficient to ensure proper upkeep & maintenance. Neglect in upkeep & maintenance can result in the development end up in a 'run-down' stage and eventually depreciation in property image & value.
Management Council, SPs and MA need to act in accordance with Building Maintenance & Strata Management Act, not anyhow they like. If acting in conflict can be an offence.

A budget is a guideline. Along the way, there will be unexpected expenses. E.g falling tree branches, burst pipes, pool pumps failing prematurely, security company withdrawing and new tenders quote higher prices. The MCST using their collective skills will have to manage the incidents using resources and skills available within the MCST. Do not expect the Managing Agent to be of much help as the condo manager is usually inexperienced.
 
The most important part of the AGM is the previous year's expenses and what huge expenses are expected to be made this year E.g. lifts replacement or repainting. Then see if the Sinking Fund and  Management Fund balance/excess/contributions can cover the expected spend. If NO, then increase in conservancy is logical. Do not veto increase, otherwise there will not be enough funds to maintain and the condo gets run down very quickly, losing its value and ability to find new owners.
 
Lastly, if you are a lawyer, engineer, architect, horticulturist, your skills will always help the MCST do a better job. Volunter to join the MCST. It is a thankless job, but if no one wants to do it, the MA will take easy way out and the estate will run out of funds or be badly maintained.

I stayed in a mixed development and 90% of the council members are from the commercial side....every year AGM, the group nominate and second each others and prevent other from joining as council members.  How to break them up?

1. You need to get enough non-commercial SPs to attend, or if they cannot attend, they pass their voting rights to you. The more share value votes you can gather the better.
 
2. At AGM, when chairman suggests number of seats in the next council (usually odd number), speak out that the composition of the Coincil should reflect same mix of the estate based on shared value. Usually the residential share-value will outnumber the commercial share-value. But it is hard to get residential SP to join Council, so unless more step forward, the commercial side will dominate MCST.
 
3. If there are more nominations than seats, a vote will be called. Candidates with most votes get into the Council. Use your own and additional nominated voting rights to vote for non-commercial SPs willing to stand, so that they get more votes and a place in MCST

Thanks everyone for your inputs.
 
From my own experience with various MCSTs, I observed a common trend.
 
The ones who talk a lot, are the clueless ones, who wanna be seen as a decision maker.
 
The professional ones.. business owners, lawyers, accountants, will not volunteer their expertise because it seems like this is a worthless cause, and they have better things to do than to debate with clueless people. 
 
The MA will usually proposed a balanced budget, but somehow.. the buffer will always get removed, till even the minimum balance in bank account also not covered. end up start owing cleaners, SP service, pool contractor, once every three months. If any SP pays late.. the situation even more dire.
 
Even when told there is a requirement to paint every 5 years, and the sinking fund have to slowly build up to fund the cyclical maintenance, the sinking fund was voted to its minimum, with the rationale.. when the time comes.. then call for special levy.
 
To see such a situation is disturbing. I realise that in today's world.. to be fiscally irresponsible is perfectly acceptable. There seem to be no minimum standards for common sense.
 
This is one area.. I think the Town Councils structure have done a better job.

Generally, those condos where the majority of residents are owner occupiers will be better maintained as the owners take a long term view of funds needed vs maintenance and running expenses.
 
Those condos where mostly tenanted or bought for investment, the owners will vote down any spending or conservancy increases. To maximise their rental profits while waiting for capital appreciation, to sell their unit.
 
The progressive wage model for guards and gardeners are  examples where costs will increase year by year. If conservancy is not increased, be prepared for security lapses and plants dying. If the condo is mainly tenanted, the owners don't care about these things or even form a Council. The condo quickly falls into disrepair. The owner-occupiers will move out due to bad behaviour of tenants and deterioriating environment.

I have witnessed where  a hefty increase in monthly maintenance fees of $120 a month is approved without even a single dissenting vote  in a Dist 11 condo (50% of units leased out) and yet in a suburban condo an hour is spent arguing over  $8 a  month increase with motion not being passed in the end. Depends very much on the quality  of residents staying in that condo which correlates to the location/value of the condo.

These self centred investors fail to realise that a badly maintained condo due to restricted funds will affect the value of their investments.
 
Hardworking and motivated councils are also in a difficult situation as they face a scenario today where rapidly increasing costs still result in poorer service standards by the vendors. Security & cleaning costs for a condo have increased by 50-70% over the past 3-4 years but the quality of guards / cleaners has declined due to severe manpower shortage. Condos are at a mercy of security firms as they know the next replacement will be no better or worst than the one being replaced. They are forced to accept lower standards at increasing cost. Ironically the progressive wage model for guards benefits Malaysians more than Singaporeans as almost 70% of the security guards today are Malaysians. In fact for my condo it is 90%

Another disturbing trend which I noticed in my constituency, at least,  is that the Neighbourhood Committees members are muscling their way into condo Management Councils where they stay as it makes it easier for them to promote the agenda of the NCs with little dissension. I am not sure they are acting on some central directive or only the particular NC in my area has adopted this modus operandi. The NC under which my condo is, oversees a few condos  and most of the NC members are also members of the Management Councils in their respective condos.
In my condo they have been creating a lot of havoc over the years. Instead of bringing communities together they have been splitting them up.
Another phenomenon is that a particular expat community has gained majority control of the council in my condo and understand this is common in other condos as well. Some of them join just so that they can organise some functions for their own community using MCST funds. The ones to be blamed for letting this happen is the apathetic locals who never bother to attend AGMs or get more involved in councils (let others do the messy job) but only turn up when their Maintenance Fund is to be increased.

Fully agree. So far my condo has bucked this trend by keeping the same local or malaysian guards and cleaners for almost ten years. Contractors change, but the staff remain. We built into the new contract that the existing staff must be employed by the new contractor with wages and leave specified. We pay a bit more, but get quality, trustworthiness, and no need to re-train. The new contractor likes the arrangement as then they do not need to source for additonal manpower which is in short supply. The ground staff are happy to stay even though their increment is small as workig conditions are good. It takes effort by the Council to be on top of things, and make effort to connect with ground staff. Cannot depend on the MA to do this as MA is appointed year to year.

So far no NC has tried to get into the condo I live in.  But then, my whole constituency is politically apathetic. Even when MP asks to visit condo, he gets turned down.
 
The MCST is a democracy in that issues are voted upon when there is disagreement within the MCST. Majority wins. As you say, if only more  qualified locals are willing to step into the MCST, and stop being apathetic, and complainers things will be better.  With a diverse council, any group with an agenda will find it harder to skew MCST spending towards the interests of their group. 
 
In other words, join the MCST if you care about the place where you live. You will be surprised how much wastage there is with condo money not being wisely spent. And the MA always takes the easy way out as they are paid a fixed sum regadless how little they work.

All parties have a parts to play to ensure that the development is well managed. That starts from all residents, council, down to the MA as well as all ground crew.
I opinion that it a long term partnership engaging all parties that will work things out.

With more condos here, the authorities should do something about Managing Agent (MA) managing these properties. BCA should licence them and ensure a certified manager is assigned. Many MA themselves are not even familiar with BASMA and run the estate like a privately owned company. They simply try to please th council members, in particular the chairman.

It is the Council who appoints and approves the Managing Agent and their annual fees. In addition, the Council approves the salaries, bonus and increments of any on-site staff employed under MA. Of course the MA will listen to the Council since it is both their boss and customer. A good MA will advice the Council what can be done under the Strata Titles Act, procedure to follow in case of disputes or bad debts, and manage projects done by contractors e.g. repairs to critical infrastructure. 
 
If you think your estate can be better run with limited funds, volunteer to be a Council member and be active. The less paid to the MA, the more funds there are to improve and run the estate. If give free hand to MA, they will likely to take easy way out and spend for thier own convenience.

Yes I know MA are appointed by council selected via AGM. Unfortunately, many MA compete for job and they under quote each other. Once on board, they run it like no rules governing it and just try to please council members in order to stay in contract.
 
Many estates ran into problem because of poor advice by MA trying to please the council members. They think getting into council means you can do whatever you like. Wait till they face lawsuit and have to be accountable for their decision. Even if they buy insurance, they are not covered.
 
A qualified MA is therefore necessary. BCA needs to review this and like all professional QP, ensure MA are certified and person assigned knows the BASMA when discharging their duties. It is not merely just about cleaning the pool and maintaining the lights.
 
This is one of problem buying into a condo and not able to enjoy your purchase. Owners should be there to approve proposal and budget and not to think of how to run it. Let professional runs it.

MCST is very similar to pte ltd companies. Companies are registered with ACRA and governed by the Comapanies Act, which ACRA almost never enforces. Instead, It relies on organisations such as auditors and CAD to ensure governance.
 
Similarly, MCST is governed by the BASMA but BCA rarely enforces. It's the govt's policy to be light handed in enforcement, relying instead on individuals, trade associations and the CAD/CPIB to ensure some form of governance.
 
There is no best answer to this issue, it's just that this GOVT has adopted this approach.
 
Therefore in such an operating environment, SPs have to play a bigger role, shoot more arrows, report CAD/CPIB more often to keep things in check. The trade associations are formed by traders so dun expect much from them. Consumers have to band together and be a guilan voice, like mothership.sg ... smrt feedback etc. Wanna band together and take on big business?
 
Lets be real.. in Sg society.. telling a blantant lie in public .. is not a criminal offence. Cheating is also not an offense without evidence that is admissible in court. And Sg society don't require marketing ppl to give statutory declarations on every thing they say, nor is AGM minutes of meeting have to be rational. It's not criminal for the MCST to enjoy $20/cup of coffees during council meetings.  
 
Therefore, my view is that.. public shaming is necessary these days. Anyone passionate about this?

BMSMA do have provision on declaration of interest. There are in fact quite some other govern in the ACT to provide guidance on proper management and maintenance of estate.
 
In fact some expenses require AGM mandate. Ex includes recreational activities. Council refreshment should also be properly managed. Encountered situation of council placing order for where where food drink even meal at restaurant...
 
However, I do agree that there are some individual that maybe acting for their own interest in one manner or another. Or out to take advantage. Of the opinion that volunteering as a Council should be from the heart to serve for the betterment of the estate and not for self interest.
I do agree at times public shaming do have its magic. However, if not handle properly may have legal implications.
If no choice but to resort to that approach, suggest blur out certain details (ie face)

It seems like there are bad impression on MA here. However just like any other trade, there are the good n bad one...
 
Engage the more reputable one, accredited by professional body such as SISV APFM. Ensure the HQ representative are able to communicate n understand ur needs. That more important than the site staff although some feel site staff more important. I opinion that HQ staff tend to stay longer with the company rather than site staff turnover in this current market with insufficient site staff.
 
Still I feel it a partnership between SP Council & MA to ensure things work out well. If not the option of self manage is there but there have to be selfless council who is willing to commit the time and manage things objectively...

BMSMA has a lot of provisions but is there a policeman who enforces it? If a section is breached, its still a costly civil suit to get defendant to comply. Furthermore, high chance the defendant will be using mcst funds for legal expenses. SG society needs a less costly social policing option. In other countries, its call culture.

Need some advise on this,
 
My MCST recently proposed a allocation of parking lot schedule, attached was the allocation already and request to vote yes or no, no vote means they decide for you, there are definitely something going on here as
 
1. Best lots are allocated to the Mcst chairman (he owns a few units)
2. This wasn't mentioned on the previous Agm and now its raised as a ad hoc decision to be made
3. Owners are given a 10 day period to respond (else managing corporation decide for you)
4. No mention how the allocation was done though from the lopsidedness its obvious
 
Problem is its a small development and several units as I know are owned by a company which as I heard don't participate much in any such concerns thought personally its seems they are railroading this to the benefit of some.
 
I've raised concerns to the MCST but it might still be voted thru, is there any legal recourse that can be taken on such cases? Not sue them but challenging them on the approach taken?
 
MCST claims its common law for such allocation to take place.
 
Cheers

Exclusive use by-laws Apart from the by-laws governing the behaviour of owners and residents, the MC can also make by-laws that give owners exclusive use of the common property for certain duration. Example With the support of an ordinary resolution, the MC can grant an owner exclusive use of part of the common property for less than a year. With a special resolution, the owner may be given exclusive use for a period of more than a year but less than three years. A 90% resolution is required to grant exclusive use for periods longer than three years. Exclusive use include the rental of a kiosk on common property or designated car parking lots for owners. [sECTION 33]

https://www.bca.gov.sg/bmsm/others/strata_living.pdf

 
3. Owners are given a 10 day period to respond (else managing corporation decide for you)
 

A motion to be decided by an ordinary resolution requires at least 14 days’ notice before the meeting. All other motions require notices of at least 21 days. The various types of resolutions [sECTION 2] and their applications are listed in a table at the end of this chapter.

May I share further that Carpark Lots are technically Common Property of the Management Corporation and Management Council are empower to manage them just like any other parts of Common Property. 
 
In line with common practice, Carpark Lots are on first come first serve basis. It is not within the power of Management Council to allocate exclusive use of the Carpark unless Resolution table & approve at a General Meeting. 
 
In specific as whether Ordinary / Special Resolution, will need to review S32 & S33 of BMSMA concurrently.

Have been asking the MA to replace a fire-rated door at the common area as it is rotten. But despite numerous reminders to him and even going to the annual meeting, door still not changed.
 
What else can I do? Report to BCA?
 
Thanks.

then prepared to get a fine from SCDF as they will likely check other areas to make sure the estate complies with fire safety. in the end the fine will come from your MCST funds and ultimately its your money lor. your management council bo chap?

The decision to replace lies with the council. If item is not on the approved budget, the MA also cant act on it. 
 
Report to authorities.. confirm end up more $$ spent by the mcst as authorities will demand that a registered inspector be appointed to carry out the inspection. U guys must love paying consultant fees.

I think there are some things which the MC and MA has to act upon whether or not there is a budget allocated (assuming the account has money la).
 
Safety is one of them.

That is not true, the approved budget is usually not so granular but there are certain types of expenditure which requires approval by SPs during an AGM or EOGM.

The approved budget i was refering to is between the MC and the MA. Typically, changing a blown bulb .. the MA does not need to seek MC approval, but non recurring high cost items like a fire door typically requires a MC decision. 
 
The point i am trying to make.. usually is the MC who is dragging their feet, not the MA.

Much depend on the SOP, Spending Matrix and empowerment given to the MA. 
 
In most cases, such expenses are within spending limit and authority of MA. However, do come across some cases where Council intervene and stop the work on pretext of cost saving, does not warrant a replacement yet or even some cases request 4/5 quotes...
 
However, there are also some MAs who really sit on things. 
 
Suggust you engage with the HQ or Management Team of the MA.
