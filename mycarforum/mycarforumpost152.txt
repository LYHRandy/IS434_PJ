I used to think that location and freehold are some of the more impt factors that increase the value of a condo.
 

But now after seeing such high prices for some 99 year old condos in OCR makes me wonder what makes a condo valuable. Furthermore these condos are not exactly very near MRT.
 

Could it be age? New condos always more expensive than older ones (even 2 year old). Like cars?
 

What estates in OCR are expensive? I certainly wouldnt want to stay in areas like Eunos, Geylang or Bedok.

Singapore is land-scarce.

Economics 101 on demand and supply will dictate.

- CCR, prime land is more scarce

- FH title is more scarce

- Landed property is more scarce
 

More and more outskirts, OCR, non-prime, 99LH condos being built.

Many can have access and the means to buy them.
 

CCR, prime, FH, landed would thus continue to appreciate in value, as whatever available land left on this tiny island is being utilized to build even more mass market condos and HDB flats ... and as our population continues to grow toward 6.5 million. 

With an almost-constant, non-growing supply of such prime landed MUKIMs, the demand for such would relatively be ever increasing - since more and more people would be aspiring to own prime FH land assets that have literally been frozen in time!

i understand but what i dont understand why are new 99LH condos in OCR that are relative near to MRT more expensive than FH condo in equally good location?
 

i can only guess its due to age.

My take on this is that the greedy developers can continue to bid very high to amass their land banks and to that end, ask for any crazy price that they must have, to realize a decent ROI.

In the recent Sky Habitat example, they sure can ask for prices even higher than say FH setups in D.11.

If there are no takers, then they are screwed and will have to lower their price.

But it's just too bad that there were indeed buyers who were willing to buy at such market-unrealistic prices.
 

But wait!

Are you sure that they are all bona fide buyers?

Not proxy buyers hired by developer, who will lapse the options on purpose?

The option money is not stamp-dutied.

But the option money retained by the developer could really be theirs, to begin with!

Who knows?

This is a great psychological game to hype up the market.

Better than any media advertisement!

Even got one fella book 2 units, then view the showrooms.

But was it his money? And just look at what it did to the masses deliberating to buy, held back only by the high prices?

In the frenzy, it's a "you hesitate and other people will snatch the unit from you" hysteria was built up.
 

Give this some thought. If I'm a developer desperate to generate demand hype, recycling option money would be the most effective, zero-cost advertisement. Paying proxys to form long queues is pass

but if, in a few months time, we start to see all the caveats lodged, then how do we explain this phenomenon?
 

my guess is that these buyers are real buyers...hence this all puzzles me




When I went to see The Luma at Grange Road, the developer was asking for $3,000psf and claimed that most units sold, left a few only.

I walked away since I did not like the external facade design and $3000psf was IMHO too high for the Grange/Devonshire locale, at that time.
 

Now, about 3 years later, I know better.

They couldn't sell ... only managed 18 units, out of 35 (or wad it 55?).

So my gut feeling was right after all.
 

They actually lied low for a while and are now re-launching ... after 3 fcuking years!!!

To answer this question, we need to look at people's mentality when it comes to investment.
 

Look at the stock market. HP, a nearly 100 year old establishment with many years of financial profits and proven products  is now worth roughly 50 billion in market cap. Facebook, on the other hand, has not even proven a history of revenue profit, but is demanding the same 50 billion in market cap when it goes IPO next month.
 

Why is investors paying so much for Facebook when most don't even know if it can last the next 10 years?
 

The answer is sentiments. Property like stocks, thrives on sentiments and hence often not rational.
 

I often look at developers like the fund managers. Having deep pockets, they can drive up prices, create sentiments and news. The fund managers, are the same...having deep pockets, they can move the market and driving the herds to buy that stock. Developers have agents to help them spread the news. The fund managers have analyst to help them do the same.
 

So it goes back to you as the investor. Are you going to buy based on sentiments, because everyone is saying sure will make money when TOP? Or are you going to evaluate the correct price and fundamentals before you make your purchase? And whether you are buying to rent or own stay does influence that decision as well.

Idle cpf and Money

people work and earn money. they want their cpf and money to grow. inflation is 5%. cpf rate and bank interest is less than 5%. somemore cpf wait long long than can taste the fruit. so must as well ultilise the cpf and idle money in the bank to buy house? peoblem is there are quite a number of people who has a substaintial amount of cash and cpf just like you and me. all of us dont like to see them idling around in the account......
 

Limited supply + demand from tenants 

land is in short supply. so people buy house and rent to foreigners who are coming in 25,000 per yr intake. even if dont rent out, still can enjoy a spanking new house.

Factor 1 : Buyers of pte condo now falls into 2 grp.

1) naive investors who are buying to sell in 4 yrs time or rent out of some "unexpected rental" yield..... these grp will look for newly launch, and generally smaller units. 

>> rental yield, that day i met with a stupid agent.. told me a particle unit could be rent out for 3.5k.. the fact is another bigger unit in the same dev is only just rented for 3k.. i dun know how she got the cheek to say 3.5k. 

>> when i was at bartley resident, the agent told me that the 2 bedrm can be rent out for 4.5k.. hmm... seriously overstated. 

2) buyer for own stay. These grp of buyer generally prefer newer condo
 

Factor 2: Low transactions on older condo.

1) monkey see , monkey do.. when alot of ppl is buying into the estate.. more ppl will buy.

2) low transaction , means valuation stay flat

Alot of older condo ,esp those at CCR, have very low transaction because owner are staying. Even if they rent out, they dun really want to sell unless they dont have holding power or other better investment alternative. 

3) very old FH are likely to enbloc... Buyers will stay way from them because of the 4 yr stamp fees.. they may be force to sell to pay stamp fee if it enbloc.

Who is the developer? According to my condo-guru friend, most developer are able to break even if they manage to sell one third of the total apartments. If the market is not good, they will withhold the sales and relaunch it when the market demands it. This will prevent the value of the apartments from going south. 
 

Till now, I'm still quite puzzled why so many ppl are buying condos? Some of my friends with combined income of slightly over 10k bought or are looking for those mass market condo where they are surrounded by HDB flats. Are they really value for $$$?

 if the FH hse u have is a landed then that is another matter.....for landed hse, FH is a true gauge of its worth because the next buyer can redevelop the hse when he takes over the FH title but for a 30, 40 yrs old condo, you cant redevelop the condo urself...you can only hope for en-bloc and not all enbloc are successful or the price you want....so location, tenure, size of condo land, plot, height ratio is still the best overall reference....

Both very risky.. 

1) there is alot new development in that area, so rental may be a problem soon.

2) rental yield low, ocr give you a better yield  

3) new development vs old development , price difference too great..  i see some older development going for 1300psf only. the 2 you mention is going for 1800-2k psf.. i find the diff is too big.. given that all are freehold.

I am looking at mansion@evelyn now.. but development quite old :(

The market is already contracting. The Q1 Index should show a price reversal and a deeper reversal in Q2.

Private home resales spring back to life
 

Updated: 20120426 BT - Kalpana Rashiwala
 

[sINGAPORE] After going into deep freeze since the additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) was introduced on Dec 8, resale transactions of completed private homes snapped back to life in March. The recovery was partly disguised amid the first quarter figures, weighed down by dismal volumes in January and February.
 

In fact, Savills Singapore's analysis shows that resale volumes for March have recovered to levels seen before the ABSD kicked in. The turnaround was sudden, as the resale market had remained jittery even while buyers were returning to property launches in the first two months of the year.
 

However, since March, agents say that some of the eye-popping per square foot (psf) prices achieved at new launches have helped to jumpstart interest in the secondary market for completed properties, where prices look more attractive.
 

Savills' analysis of URA Realis caveats data shows 1,142 resale deals for private homes (excluding ECs and en bloc sales) done in March - double the 565 caveats for February and more than three times January's volume of 314 transactions. The March number also exceeds December's volume of 776 and November's 981.
 

"Given that the average monthly resale volume for 2011 was 1,166 transactions, the March numbers show that resale volumes have recovered back to pre-ABSD levels," said Savills Singapore research head Alan Cheong.
 

The March 2012 resale volume is still 23 per cent below the 1,480 caveats lodged in March 2011.
 

The final tally for March 2012 could rise as more caveats stream in over the next few weeks. Savills' analysis, based on caveats captured by URA Realis as at April 24, also showed 332 resale transactions being done so far this month.
 

Savills commented: "The pace of resales in April is still healthy. Agents are still conducting frequent viewings and enquiries. Barring any new property cooling measures or external shocks, resales should remain robust for the next few months - given the current low interest rate environment, liquidity and increasing population scenario, among other factors."
 

The weak performance in the first two months dragged down the volume of resale deals of private homes for Q1 this year to 2,021, a decline of nearly 25 per cent from 2,688 in the preceding quarter and a year-on-year drop of 42.3 per cent from 3,503 units in Q1 2011.
 

"When the ABSD was imposed on Dec 8, 2011, new home sales practically froze in the following weeks. Subsequent to the successful launch of Watertown and Parc Rosewood in January, resale buyers took a while to fully absorb the fact that the property market still has legs. Only in March did they put pen to paper," said Mr Cheong.
 

Agents report that high prices achieved for 99-year leasehold suburban launches like Watertown in Punggol (with median prices of about $1,340 psf in February and March) and Sky Habitat in Bishan, which marked a new record for the suburban condo market based on an average price said to be about $1,650 psf after taking into account the initial 3 per cent discount given to all buyers - have helped to stir interest in the resale market and in projects launched earlier that are still being marketed by developers.
 

Archipelago, a five-storey, 99-year condo facing Bedok Reservoir Park, is going at about $1,000 psf on average.
 

Compared to Sky Habitat, resale prices for some completed freehold properties in the prime districts would appear attractive to some buyers, say agents. For example, a 990 sq ft ground floor unit at One Jervois changed hands for $1,515 psf (reflecting an absolute price of $1.5 million) in March, while a 947 sq ft unit on the third floor of Jervois Regency sold for $1,361 psf (about $1.29 million) in April.
 

A 12th floor unit of 2,250 sq ft at Residences@ Evelyn changed hands at $1,609 psf in March, while a 2,508-sq ft fourth floor unit at Chelsea Gardens at Walshe Road sold for $3.8 million, which works out to $1,515 psf.
 

David Neubronner, director of residential project sales, Jones Lang LaSalle, said: "Completed freehold properties at Meyer Road and in Districts 10 and 11 priced at $1,500-1,600 psf represent good values for owner occupiers."
 

Although psf prices are higher for new launches, absolute price quantums are generally bigger for older completed projects as units are mostly larger.
 

"Buyers of resale properties may be a different group than those buying in the primary market; they could be better heeled," suggests an agent.
 

Credo Real Estate executive director (residential) Manjit Gill says the company has seen an increase in enquiries and requests for viewings of completed properties in the resale market, particularly those in the vicinity of new launches.
 

"While psf prices are lower in the resale market, buyers would have to make full payment of the purchase price upon completion of sale (usually in three months) whereas if they buy a unit from a developer in a newly launched project, progress payments can stretch over the three years or more that it takes to complete the project," he adds. Lower psf prices in the resale market may also be due to the age of the project and its facilities.

[sINGAPORE] After going into deep freeze since the additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) was introduced on Dec 8, resale transactions of completed private homes snapped back to life in March. The recovery was partly disguised amid the first quarter figures, weighed down by dismal volumes in January and February.

 

Rubberpad, a few rules when you are studying properties.
 
 

1) Resale volume and new sales volume do not mean anything. Overall prices do not depend on volume. Fact is, volume is always a case of selective reporting because it is easy to sensationalize.

2) Never take analyst/agents report seriously when comes to investment be it stock or property. I wouldn't even waste my time reading one. To me these reports are garbage.

3) Do your own study by examining the figures from the URA site, STI indices and more importantly, the stock performance of the developers. These numbers do not lie.
 

Like a stock bubble before it burst, there will always be a spike in volume and a run-up of prices. Everybody wants to get in so that they don't miss the boat. But the smart ones are already cashing out and standing by the sideline.

depends on your investment horizon.
 

Long term it is a buy. To me, Apple is cheap even at this price.
 

Heck, even the whole Tech sector in US is cheap.
 

The banking sector is even cheaper.

I wouldn't buy this stock for long term, unless you want to bet on some short term reversal play.
 

A stock like this will take a long time to recover....if it ever recover.
 

I hope you didn't hold onto large losses due to the rapid fall.
 

BTW, don't ask me anymore on stocks advice.

I'm not surprised by the sudden spike in sales.
 

The buying momentum hasn't really gone away. It merely removed the aspirant buyer. I mean, look at the high hurdles today wif ABSD, SSD, 40% d/p, no DPS and many s'poreans can still buy. Meaning, the mkt is driven by those who could reallli afford to buy wif little risks to the banking system. Plus, IMF reported that the world economy is poised for growth, the risk of a china hard landing has dissipated, euro banks survived the stress tests, US economy showing signs of recovery, stubbornly high inflation rates wif equally high oil and commodity prices, professor study say we need 25000 new immigrants/year, etc, etc. If anything, i tink next month we'll see even higher sales numbers. 
 

Same like COE, sales at MB & BMW macam fish market liddat despite high prices. Those who could afford not affected and onli weeded out those who were looking at cheaper cars.

I used to think that location and freehold are some of the more impt factors that increase the value of a condo.
 

But now after seeing such high prices for some 99 year old condos in OCR makes me wonder what makes a condo valuable. Furthermore these condos are not exactly very near MRT.
 

Could it be age? New condos always more expensive than older ones (even 2 year old). Like cars?
 

What estates in OCR are expensive? I certainly wouldnt want to stay in areas like Eunos, Geylang or Bedok.

Reported 2 days ago...
 

Is the sheer number of new properties, resale properties and public housing options simply too mind-boggling for the home buyer? It seems so for some, as seen by the number of buyers returning their units in March, thus forfeiting their option fee. What could be the reasons? Buyers of 107 new private homes had a change of heart last month and returned their units to developers. The numbers, contained in a report from Goldman Sachs, show that even in a hot market, some people get cold feet. The same report also stated that 100 homes were returned the month before. That means these buyers have paid an option fee but have chosen not to exercise the option and go ahead to complete the purchase. When someone buys a new condominium, they put down an initial option fee of 5 per cent to

If bus driver also can get a 16% increment, I dun see any reason why we are not getting 20% this year.

seems to be the case now.
 

i was shopping for a unit in particular development.
 

the transacted prices showed all high floor units sold only and between 905k - 980k
 

so recently i made offer for high floor unit 950k got rejected.  think the other buyer eyeing this unit got rejected as well and went to buy a 3rd floor unit 960k........crazy le, no low floor sold the last 4 months and this buyer snap up a 3rd floor at 960k? another case of blind optiism or panic buying.

there's a slight lag in the ura caveat prices or sometimes there's no caveats lodged. so, units may hv been transacted at higher prices or prices may hv moved when u made the offer.

In this current climate where unemployment rate is low, economy doing fairly ok, interest rates at record lows, there is no compulsion by home-owners to sell their units lower when they can afford to hold. ABSD... a deterrence but not effective enough. Prices moderate yes, but not enough to make home prices come down. Not to mention all the hot money flying around in the world.The only time it will it when all of the above kicks in. 
 

Perhaps its time to raise interest rates

Hi,
 
 
If you are about to buy a condo then you are opting the perfect investment options. The foremost benefit of owning a condo is that it reduces the overall expenditures.
 
 
 

 
In what ways?

seriously, many colleague said the same thing after they commit a condo
ah Q thinking that regardless the condo is over-priced, just take it as long term investment and "force saving" ... 
5,10, 15 years later .... 99.99999% the property price will not lower than what is bought today
just like today property price will never return to 10-15 years ago

Not necessary, I still see people spending on big ticket items, not much changes to their previous lifestyle.

Been observing this trend too. Maybe it could be due to the rental it can fetch.
 
Assuming both the FH and LH99 condo are located in the same location, the newer condo is likely to fetch a higher rental regardless if it is a LH or FH. Price of condo is largely affected by the rental it can fetch.

i understand but what i dont understand why are new 99LH condos in OCR that are relative near to MRT more expensive than FH condo in equally good location?
 
i can only guess its due to age.

 
Agree.

but if, in a few months time, we start to see all the caveats lodged, then how do we explain this phenomenon?
 
my guess is that these buyers are real buyers...hence this all puzzles me

 
Perhaps it could be those <1 million 1 or 2 bedder condo that sells well in the OCR. 
 
Looking at the starting pay for fresh grads to be around 3-4K nowadays, a young couple in their late 20s can easily buy a 2 bedroom OCR condo in the range of 600-800K, if they manage they manage their money well.

My first property more than 10 years ago was a hdb 5 room flat that's 300+k in a mature estate with 5k cov.. That time everybody rushing to buy smaller 3 room and 4 room flat with 20+-40k cov. First thing I did was to rent out 3 rooms while I stay in 1 room when me n wife combined income is very little.. over years we work and save the rental... 
 
Then in 2009 sell the flat and moved on to the next 2 property and 1 of them is a 1700sqft old apartment that super cheap and another 1500sqft old condo that's relatively cheap as everyone is rushing to showflat and snapping up new n more expensive units. 
 
sold the old apartment in less than 2 years n make almost 70% in return.. 
 
I viewed almost 30 units of hdb when I buy the flat, and viewed almost 60units of private property.. cost if burning many weekends just doing viewing. In 2013 only viewed DUO residence and kicking myself for not buying bec think too much into ABSS.
 
Nowadays a lot of people very rich, buy big ticket items like property only view less than 10 units.
 
I agree totally with Porker that property is still about location.. 
 
Nowadays most people buy a sub urban condo from developer at 1200psf all kanna chop by developer.. if those hillview or woodlands condo buy at 1200psf now, and can sell 1400psf in 5 years time, a 1800 psf at OCR can easily offload at 2100-2200psf... That making 200more psf in the future.
Lots of property that's cheaper than New launches.. 
 
if buy a new launch at tanah merah for 1200psf, and existing older 5-6year old condo around there also sell 1200-1300psf... Then the existing condo can fetch a rental of 2.5-3.5% rental, and after 4 years, the total rental collected would reduce the entire property purchase to 1000-1100psf even if they are 5-6years older.
