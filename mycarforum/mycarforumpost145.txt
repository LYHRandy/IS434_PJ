The tender for a private housing site at Tampines Avenue 10 attracted 10 bids at the close yesterday, with developers unfazed by the new loan curbs imposed by the central bank late last month. 

The 99-year leasehold site, released from the Confirmed List of the Government Land Sales programme, drew a top bid of S$289.7 million from MCC Land, or about S$562.01 per sq foot per plot ratio, the Urban Redevelopment Authority said. Sitting on about 184,094 sq ft of land that can be developed to a maximum gross floor area of 515,472 sq ft, the site can yield 530 homes.
 

Ms Christine Li, Head of Research and Consultancy at real estate agency OrangeTee, said the top bid was “very bullish” despite the new Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) framework. Under the TDSR, the total debt obligations of the mortgagor cannot exceed 60 per cent of his gross income, new loan repayments are calculated based on a medium-term interest rate of 3.5 per cent or the prevailing rate if the latter is higher, and guarantors will be brought in as co-borrowers.
 

Ms Li noted that MCC Land’s bid was “34 per cent higher than the adjacent site sold in May 2012, where Q Bay is located. In terms of number of bidders that participated in the tender, it’s a vast improvement from the Q Bay site, where only three bidders participated.”
 

“The bids could be encouraged by the sell-out of J Gateway as well as the announcement to make Tampines North ... a bustling new town in the coming years,” she added.

cannot afford PC can go EC 

but EC price also trailing behind very closely

i always heard the sales mentioned 30% cheaper ... nabei where is the word cheap come from?

tax payer money is used to fund buyer to buy $700K-$800K executive condo? simi logic???

not forgetting the larger units and penthouses that cost $1M and above

SINGAPORE — Demand for executive condominiums (ECs) has remained buoyant, with another such private-public housing development receiving a robust response at its opening weekend. 

The 380-unit Lush Acres in Sengkang by City Developments was oversubscribed by about 1.6 times as of Sunday, the developer said yesterday.
 

The announcement followed the launch a week earlier of Ecopolitan in Punggol by Qingjian Realty, which received more than 1,000 applications for its 512 units.
 

Analysts TODAY spoke to said the rising cost of private homes has contributed to the popularity of the relatively more affordable ECs.
 

Data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority has shown growing sales of ECs in recent months, peaking at 457 units in May before moderating to 313 last month.
 

“When prices of mass market condominiums go beyond a certain level, ECs become a good option for people to upgrade their houses at an affordable price,” said Mr Nicholas Mak, Executive Director for Research and Consultancy at SLP International Property Consultants.
 

“ECs have the features of condominiums and typically are priced at S$700 to S$800 per square foot, which is about 30 per cent cheaper than private condominiums,” he said.
 

ECs can also enjoy capital appreciation as attractive as that of a private residence, according to Ms Christine Li, Head of Research and Consultancy at property firm OrangeTee.
 

“The price gap between mass market private property and the EC has widened, which makes ECs a better choice. From what we see with ECs that were launched in the 1990s, when they turned private after 10 years, their value can be as close as 5 per cent to a mass market condo,” she said.
 

She added that, with the prices of mass market private residences or those in the suburban areas not likely to decline in the near future, the appetite for the hybrid private-public homes will continue to be strong.
 

“The land cost for mass market private condos has gone up by 30 to 40 per cent in one year … and if you work out the figures, you can see that the price of new launches will not go below S$1,000 per square foot,” Miss Li said.
 

Three more EC developments are in the pipeline and will be launched by the end of this year. They are Sea Horizon in Pasir Ris, Waterwoods in Punggol and SkyPark Residences in Sembawang.
 

Another two sites were sold under the Government Land Sales programme in May, but the winning developers are only allowed to launch units for sale 15 months from the date of award of the sites, or after the physical completion of foundation work, whichever is earlier.

tax payer money is used to fund buyer to buy condo at a discount (so to speak) and then allow them to make a HUGE profit after enjoying the discount (5 years sell to PR, 10 years sell to foreigner)

EC is a very good tool to control reales HDB price

you see ah: most buyer of EC are 2nd timer

they have to sell their flat 6 months after TOP

let say 1 EC got 60% 2nd timer and 1 EC got 400 unit, so 2nd timer is 240 units

so when 1 EC TOP, 240 resale hdb are released into the market

viola!!! HDB resale price is somewhat controlled  
 

At the same time, when people buy EC, they also have to pay Govt for the land cost (now is about $300psf)

Govt earn $300 and can somewhat control reslae price

it is the land that the Govt get revenue from (in this case(

they purpousely stop building jumbo, EA, EM so that people who want bigger house are forced to buy EC (cheapest alternative) 
 

so in this way, Govt can raise some revenue and yet can control resale price abit

First timer buy EC, get $30k CPF grant in lieu of a BTO, i tink it's fair.
 

But upgrader make $$ from BTO and yet get to buy EC without resale levy?......Now, that's a GIGANTIC loophole that unker khaw needs to pay attention to instead of tempering and messing up the private property market which receives ZERO subsidies from the gahmen.

3. last but not least ... household income <$12K big deal ... and ec is priced at $700k-$800k and larger units close to $1M targeting these buyers ... simi logic? i wonder what is their TDSR

actually, was it considered fund?? since a biding took place, unless you mean that bidding with a lower building cost in mind is consider fund. 
 

i thought 2nd timer cannot take grant???
 

because citizen are complaining that house hold income between 8K ~12K is suffereing because cannot buy HDB flat and not money to buy condo???

And pay more doesn't necessarily mean better quality, esp for lower-end condo where it's more price sensitive and the design & finishes are pretty much std. U pay more becoz developer overpaid for the land and pass it on the willing buyers.

http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10321p.nsf/w/...EC?OpenDocument
 
Overview
Executive Condominiums (EC) were introduced to cater to Singaporeans, especially young graduates and professionals who can afford more than an HDB flat but find private property to be out of their reach. ECs are comparable in design and facilities to private condominiums as they are developed and sold by the private developers.
 
Executive Condominium (EC) owners who have occupied their EC and met the 5-year minimum occupation period (MOP) can sell their EC in the open market. The 5-year MOP is computed from the date of issuance of Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) in respect of each EC. 
 
http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10321p.nsf/w/...en?OpenDocument
 
After the 5-year MOP, from 6th to 10th year, EC can be sold in the open market to those who can meet the following eligibility conditions. 
 
Citizenship 
Family Nucleus 
CPF Housing Grant 

From 11th year, all restrictions will be lifted. Foreigners and corporate bodies can buy ECs in the open market from 11th year of the EC project.
 
not hearsay it is true after 10 years they are sold like normal condo 
 
http://news.xin.msn.com/en/singapore/artic...entid=251457791
 The last Executive Condominium, or EC, development launch for the year in Singapore ended on a high... at a record 2.05 million dollars! [\quote]  
 
http://news.xin.msn.com/en/property/storyv...entid=251220743
 
A recently sold penthouse in Heron Bay executive condominium was priced at a record $1.77 million. But here's the catch: Under Housing and Development Board (HDB) rules, executive condominium buyers cannot exceed a monthly household income of $12,000[\quote] 
does this price look affordable to COMBINEd income of not more than $12K ...even upgraders sold their BTO etc also hard to afford this kind of price

wah.. even DBSS they didnt do QA check... very  bad.

i think it is because they haven't release enuf yet 
 

u ask HDB to pre built another 200,000 flats like the ghost town in jurong last time, u see if price fall or not




but that is time also coincide with the financial crisis mah. so its really hard to say its because of 200K unit release or because of financial crisis. 
 

althought yeah.. i am waiting for them to build ghost town again. price is really our of hand now.

these hdb owners and supposedly low-income owner are pampered silly by our public housing policy.  when pte ppty market run away, they hit it hard.  almost like trying to achieve social equity by bringing the higher net worth people down to comparable levels with hdb owners



 

Wonder if those BTO owners need to dispose of their flat b4 signing the S&P and enjoy a lower 20% DP wif no ABSD? If get to keep their BTO until TOP and yet get away without 40% DP and no ABSD, i tink unker khaw realli need to wake up.

for upgrade to EC I am not sure.
 

but for my friend who was thinking about upgrading to pte condo, cannot escape the ABSD.  he checked and found out ABSD refund can only happen if he downgrading from condo to hdb.  maybe someone can shed some light on this?
 

all the property policies are quite poorly thought out.

its even worse now becoz home equity has become political, as in if they dont support HDB prices, next erection they will get blamed by vote against them.

anyway many of these people are not really low income.  they just start low because they are young and few years later they will be laughing their way to the bank when their income goes up and yet they have huge gains from subsidised public housing.
 

and then some of them gets huge part of the purchase price of EC or even HDB paid by their parents

Everyone are frustrated with the policies lah..
 

Miss the boat :super frustrated and scare.. cos no house stay. 
 

Those who just sold pty : frustrated becase the bullrun show no sign of slowing down.. though alot of CM come announce. J Gateway still sell until ling ling long long. And if they buy replacement now, will kena ABSD... if not their only pty.

Those who just bought : frustrated becase alot of CM. SSD stopping them to sell to cash out.
 

Those that has cash : cannot buy cos buy kena ABSD.. dun know will make back or not..

Those that has less cash : cannot buy because 50% DP + ABSD..
 

Those with pty , thinking of selling : dun know what to do because..some ppl say this .. some ppl say that...
 

Tell me who is not frustrated ?

history repeats itself

the more people talk about crash ... there is no crash

the more people talk about huat ah ... higher go higher ... everything skyrocketed (past tense hor) ... crash comes overnight like lehman brothers ... by midnight must go back company dabao
 

if greece, portugal, spain, italy all can survive in ICU ... singapore is in disneyland ... all systems go



 

the waiting shld be too long... now everyone is shouting huat now.. while sales for subsale is slow.
 

Many top already no tenant... once vacancy rate goes up to 10%.. then.. 3 mths later.. shld be "buyer's" mkt liao.

this is true in other country but not in singapore

the holding power is sibei strong

empty unit just left it empty for 2-3 years to flip especially for surburb private condo and mickey mouse unit
 

by saying holding power is sibei strong referring to govt/mas statement that there isn't many people "over gearing on loan" hence no issue

hmm... yeah holding power is strong.. but hor... many ppl wont want to pay 4-5k to maintain a empty unit. Even the tablewiper also cashing out... (4-5k refer to pty tax, mantance , mortgage insurance ) . Having said that prices may not come down. Just that more ppl will be selling as they wait for the next tenant... 
 

ppl are holding 2-3 yrs.. because of nearby condo are selling hot hot at higher price.. once reality sets in, that is too many empty units. Buyer will stop snapping new development.. and you will see some ppl start to panick liao...
 

4 yrs back.. subsale super hot because buy already immediate got rental income.. you see now.. subsale not moving liao... something is brewing...
 
 

BTW , 1 qtr vacancy rate went down instead of going up.. *sigh*.. hopefully we see better 2nd qtr.

soon will 2014 liao, then another 3yrs is 2017, 10yr anniversary of 2007 mkt top. Rem wad happened in 1997 too.
 

Lets put it this way, based on $$ flow, there is still too much doubt in global economic recovery, still too much $ in bonds n cash. In order for a big crash, we need to see more $$ put to riskier asset such as stocks etc. Property isnt considered as risky. This 4yr property bull run is synonymous w d bond bullrun, coz pple got lots of $$ duno where to put so all go property or bonds.
 

D recent bond selloff is indication of early stage stock mkt n risky asset bull run IMO. Alot of $$ moving out of bonds yielding 2-4% into higher return growth assets instead.
 

SG property has been overbought ahead of fundamentals but it wont face as much outflow as bonds as its slightly less rate sensitive due to its capital gain angle, in fact to me its just gona plateau or inch up <1% each qtr for next few yrs.
 

Until the $$ which left bonds have moved into riskier assets, its hard 2 see global crash due to amt of $$ in bonds n cash. 
 

Outlier is china slowing down to 5% GDP p.a. growth rate n god knows how that affects us. Just b ready for anything.
 

Disclaimer: i used 2 b a banker, n am glad im not anymore. Finally can think freely n lead a "carefree" life, so im just sharing my thoughts from experience. :)

depending on situation, i find property more risky. stock drop just sell. if lose job, depends got willing buyer for property. i agree property is great investment but wallet must be deep enough.

Agree. As the saying goes: Be careful what u wish for.



 

Will come one , cracks are starting to happen. As people over extend themselves , it is just a matter of time before pop goes the bubble.
 

As demand for retail property slows , people will soon be unable to repay their loans. The over supply will topple the demand in the matter of half to 1 and half years.
 

Those that are currently buying are almost the last ones on board as we are going to go through a series of higher interest rates , the lower pay high risk takers will soon be out of the race , reason being many that are around over stretched and many will not be able to find demand for their 2nd hand properties. Once these people are out of the picture , the supply will outflow.
 

Since everyone is going for 1st hand , tell me who is buying the 2nd hand ones? If so do you think this bull run is sustainable ? By what? Ask yourself a simple question who is going to buy from someone which has bought a property at an inflated price with relations to rental and demands a premium on top of whatever they have bought ? It is just a matter of time. 
 

With our EDB running out of new ideas of how to bring more investments into singapore , it is just a matter of time before jobs dry up. And idoits are still demanding for FW to go elsewhere making our competitiveness even worse. Once people starts losing their jobs , it won't be long before this happens.
 

Bank sales staff are slowly feeling the pinch of lower demands in loans , property agents are slowly feeling it while sitting on a couple themselves ,  even normal office workers can't keep up with the increasing rates. So who is going crack first? This would probably the first of many economic downtimes the strawberries are going to see. Bucket up .

in spore context, i don't think there are many cases of over extending or stretching on loans
 

oversupply? yes and no

i do feel there is a scenario of over supply but time and time again i have been proved wrong when new project sold out and EC oversubscribed. literally demand > supply, that's FACT
 

interest rate goes up. yes, that is for sure. unless it goes up to 5%-7% etc. now is at record low of 1-2% and another 1-2% i think the loan quantum and servicing is not affected badly
 

in terms of FDI slowdown and jobs dried up ... that's a big question and there is always a "magical hand" to interfere the market
 

like i said ... USA and EU is in ICU and SPORE is in disneyland

if spore gone into coma in icu, usa and eu can go to hell liao ... because they certainly cannot survive the high interest rates

I only know of one fellow in HWZ who has been predicting about property crash for the last 2 years. He was good confident, rude and arrogant about his claims that he got CSI out. 
 

Pics were splashed. 

Name revealed

Details of company revealed.

His activities on dating web sites were revealed. 

His seek help thread on some medical website for anal fistula-fissure (aka piles) were exposed too!  
 

Haha, when it comes to property, it's a sensitive topic.

ENLARGECAPTION 

SINGAPORE: Demand for new private homes in Singapore surged nearly 54 per cent on-month in August, after the sharp decline seen in July.
 

According to latest figures from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), 742 new private homes were sold last month, compared to the 482 units transacted in July.
 

The best-selling project in August was The Tembusu at Tampines Road with 218 units sold.
 

Including executive condominiums (EC), a total of 1,468 new homes were sold in August, with ECs accounting for nearly half of August's sales.
 

The most popular EC projects were Ecopolitan at Punggol with 335 units sold and Lush Acres at Sengkang, selling 311 units.

I only know of one fellow in HWZ who has been predicting about property crash for the last 2 years. He was good confident, rude and arrogant about his claims that he got CSI out. 
 

Pics were splashed. 

Name revealed

Details of company revealed.

His activities on dating web sites were revealed. 

His seek help thread on some medical website for anal fistula-fissure (aka piles) were exposed too!  
 

Haha, when it comes to property, it's a sensitive topic.

100,000 homes to hit market from now till 2016!!!



 

Did you realised that the article mentioned that the house they bought is to be left empty..

Actually quite a lot of friends, i know just left their SK/Punggol bto empty after they gotten their keys.
 

Before kids, they left it empty because farther from work place than their parent's place. After kids, cannot move because need someone to take care of the children..

just some interesting view of the matter. Chinese ,in general, strongly believe in owning a "roof" over their head.. or at least on paper.  
 

Even if they live with their in-laws, they also want some property under their name.  

MOP is the reason why didnt rent out.. but some i know dont want to rent out because dun want ppl to spoil their reno. They just leave it there as a holiday home.. go there during wkends. In any case, their home loan are paid by cpf.. so they also dun bother. 
 

Another grp that is hogging up the supply, are the SC with oz pr, i know of friends who applied BTO so that they can "use" their CPF that are left in SG.

Demand for new private homes in Singapore surged nearly 54 per cent on-month in August, after the sharp decline seen in July.

ENLARGECAPTION 

SINGAPORE: Demand for new private homes in Singapore surged nearly 54 per cent on-month in August, after the sharp decline seen in July.
 

According to latest figures from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), 742 new private homes were sold last month, compared to the 482 units transacted in July.
 

The best-selling project in August was The Tembusu at Tampines Road with 218 units sold.
 

Including executive condominiums (EC), a total of 1,468 new homes were sold in August, with ECs accounting for nearly half of August's sales.
 

The most popular EC projects were Ecopolitan at Punggol with 335 units sold and Lush Acres at Sengkang, selling 311 units. 
 

- CNA/gn



 
 

all these "sales figure" news are just noises.
 

If that month has few launches, naturally, sales figures will drop. If that month has many new launches, sales figures will naturally goes up.
 

What is more accurate as a measurement is the sales rate or "take-up rate". If that month has a total of 1000 new launch units and 250 were sold, then sales rate is 25%.  Not surprisingly, the sales rate were never released as news.

Yup , numbers as we know can be used to present a certain scope .

Never just read a set of numbers or worse still one number.

Especially month to month numbers 
 

What is clear is that every month we are getting different numbers, good, bad, good bad , good bad.

this signals inconsistnecies and volatility as oppose to stability.  
 

Lets see the take up rate after the first initial "grand opening" hype....

agree. the examples u mentioned above I also know 1 or 2 cases n the spoil reno one confirmed come fr the wife.  
 

but china is a totally different situation fr Singapore. they dun hv "HDB" like us so in the 1st tier cities, they are totally on their own to buy their homes n the sheer competition fr new migrants fr other provinces. anyone with the means wil surely hog.

the only way is big economy slowdown and our unemployment rate increase. then no FTs cos no jobs.

Helping a little on the numbers you posted.
 

Population in 2030

6,9m - 5.3m = 1.6m
 

SG average household size is 3.5 persons. So thats roughly translate to 457k homes required. Thats is in 17 yrs time. So, a year requirements is roughly 27k.
 

100k homes is by 2016? Thats 3 yrs later. So, 27k x 3 = 81k homes required. Supply maybe just nice to catch up previous years demands. Anyway, birth rate is declining and also homes are smaller. So, I suspect average household size will be smaller and smaller.

We are assumming that ppl need to stay in the house that they bought.. 
 

seriously, i recall viewing a few units last few years . 3 in sunhaven ,2 in starvilles and a few in telok kurau area.. where the units are left empty after TOP.  the owner didnt even rent them out.. They just hog the unit. 
 

Dun ask me why.. cos' i dun know these ppl, just view their house only.

The vacancy rate is stable at 5-6% for all private homes. This number is a little like unemployment rate (using this as an analogy). There is always someone who is inbetween jobs or like what you says, dun really need to have a job.

it's not interest rate alone.. cos' sc/pr pay housing using CPF.. which they can see but cannot touch. 

As long as $$ does not affect their daily expenditure .. they rather use it to buy a physical commodity. Buy stock also cannot see the $$ .. :(
 

Say.. SC couple owns a fully paid hdb. And continue to put $2k into cpf mthly.  If he managed to have 160k in cpf, he buys a condo at 800k, and pay fully using cpf. To him, there is no different.. just has an extra holiday home. :)

a fundamental way to see how strong dis mkt really is is by yield. 
 

https://squarefoot.com.sg/market-watch/rental-yield
 

Looking yield chart, by right a solid economy driving income n jobs shld have rising yields, which in turn drag up capital values (2005-2007).
 

THis time rd its not having that effect, instead yield r compressing nonstop as values increase despite falling yield. To me this phenomenon is almost purely due to abnormally low SIBOR. In 2005-2007, SIBOR was rising together w prop prices, so to a certain extent downside was realized. 
 

This time rd SIBOR is record low n so r yields. Will yields reverse up when SIBOR goes back up? Ive no idea wat is gonna b i like to look at all fundamentals, not just supply demand.

then where do they stay?

if buy hdb and stay in private condo is illegal isn't it?

if they live with parent (hdb or private), then they are hoging the unit until 5 years MOP to sell = also illegal right?
 

if this is allow, then many will just whack BTO and hog the unit until MOP or rent out 2 rooms lock 1 room and live with parent?

Haha.. thought NS lesson is : you can do anything as long as not caught?
 

U can always rent out rooms if within MOP... Rent out while place if out of MOP.
 

Years ago when I have my modest 5 room hdb, I built a bedroom out of dining room area (hdb approved), so total 4 bedrooms and rent out 3 bedroom while I stay master bedroom. Nothing to shout about, but it help getting bills paid while everything is legal and within guidelines and regulations.
 

Why do u sound so sore in your replies with regards to HDB ownership and rental? Any bad experience to share?

perfectly fine if you live / stay in your own hdb within the MOP 

i'm only against the leave the entire unit empty and the lock 1 room trick > both against the policy
 

it's perfectly fine with me if you make another room in the living room and rent out 3 rooms. that's fine and within the means. not hogging the unit nor depriving another eligible person to get the unit as you are living in the unit.
 

yes, nothing is wrong until caught ... it works everywhere

I thk that mus b the dream plan for ALL SC - fully pay HDB then invest in another pte for rental income.  
 

but only 2 things that destroy the dream (1) subsequent ppty using cpf, hv to set aside half of prevailing sum and (2) usu for average folks, likely when they can do this, they are prob late 30s? no more 30 yr loan so its def possible to b out of pocket every mth.
 

and of cos this type of scenario one I thk is the most cannot hold one. act the more of this kind, the more downward pressure on rental prices.

Actually, alot of ppl i know that bought their house 10 yrs ago have repaid their cpf contribution to their first home with cash. And use their CPF to financed their 2nd unit.

10 yrs ago.. 5 rm only 200k leh?! very cheap only.

i guess many like to stay on the grey area like not putting parking coupon or hdb shops putting their merchandise on corridor to maximise their opportunity

normal habit is either siam from spending or taking advantage to earn more ... the "kill people put fire" ... not dare to do one ... SC are good people

agree. but when one with some cash stares at 0.1% pa savings rate, hear of the amazing stories of how a fren's fren's neighbours made millions fr ppty, even a 2% rental yield plus potential capital upside is enuff for them to jump in.
 

but when sibor moves up, ur mortgages go up, u start to get more decent savings rate, some pple wil ditch their ppty investments if stil cant get tenants or hv made some profit fr capital. so other than economy, everything is still interest rate.

aniway.. when you get you key that day.. do you stay inside immediately? 

The MOP just disallow you rent out only. You stay there or not.. seriously hdb dun bother one lah. if not why mop start from the day you get your keys.
 

If they really bothers, then they shld start MOP from the day you change your ic address. that is enforced by law that you shld be physically staying there..

Actually, alot of ppl i know that bought their house 10 yrs ago have repaid their cpf contribution to their first home with cash. And use their CPF to financed their 2nd unit.

10 yrs ago.. 5 rm only 200k leh?! very cheap only.



 

agree but now damn difficult. prices is one, like 800k condo where? n the 10% SD. without CPF "help", buying tat 2nd ppty now is chao chao $300k-400k affair.

the next trend to tackle is the >35 yr old single staying with parents. They are now buying flat, without SD and waiting for MOP to ends.

units for single has a strict rule for resale ... but ... the market for single has 'huge' potential judging for 70x over subscribed 

next is multi-generation-unit speculation ... any type of unit can be speculated ... property speculation is no 1 SC entrepreneurship ... me included

aniway.. there will creative ways to get ard the regulation one lah.. it just a matter of time ppl explores these options...

1 of the options is lease-to-buy which is practises in other countries. The agreement is a rental agreement with a option to buy house after x yrs of rental and the rental contributes to the overall buy price. 
 

Given the current SD . I believe at some point this option will be made available to buyers. They pays $y sum of $$ to rent for x yrs.. and after x yrs, the assume ownership of the pty. Seller dun incurred seller stamp duty.. and buyers, get to secure the price.

Stock increase 3,478. Only half of the increase is absorb by the population.
With the hdb prices stablised, it is likely that overall residential prices will be stablised or declined for the quarters forward..
 
Those planning to rent out their current unit and move to their new house.. may have a problem getting tenants at good price.

Certainly not this lot.
 
This is more likely the "no sell,cant buy" type.
Or the "look see look see" type
Or the "jones bought so i must also die die buy even if it means borrow the highway to hell" type

Thats great news, but can they continue to absorb the supply?  One after another?
Leave empty also no problem ( for how long , if valuations drop?)
I stand by my view that there is no argument where the direction of the market is headed.  DOWN.
Its the velocity and magnitude.
