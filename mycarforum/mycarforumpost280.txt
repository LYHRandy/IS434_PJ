Haiz...  
 

What to do? We cannot do anything also. They suddenly say season parking increase to 150 per month and conservancy charges increase to 350 per month we cannot do anything also.

I guess so. Like the case reported. I currently pay over $160 (including parking) for my HDB, but my low-end condo at Upp Bt Timah area cost only around $220 (include security guard, security system, swimming room, sauna room, gym, well-appointed lift lobby, etc). My wife and I just couldn't quite understand why HDB could not bring their cost down.

but is it reasonable to assume that there is a minimum cost to maintaining an estate

eg bus trip - minimum number of passengers per trip to break even, 

hence is it true that HDB charging us at a minimum cost
 

one thing for sure, there are lots of questions about accountability in HDB

tender for lifts upgrade - is it an open exercise 

who is the nut that approve the china made lifts in many HDB estate that breakdowns so often, hence maintainence cost shooting up - who is going to answer for this
 

my lift have been upgraded for nearly 6months but the partially torn protective plastic cover (ulgy) is still not taken off

my mail box continues to receive junk mails - every day got at least one, i thought they upgrade the mailbox (we pay for it) their aim was to prevent junk mail - it seems the truth is helping Post-office to increase revenue to charge these junk mail senders

my neighbour car got scatched a few times (he is a decent chap) call HDB - standard answer - uncle how to catch the offended, do you want HDB to send someone to stand by your car and we have to charge you for his salary

no regards to neighbourhood, want to build multi-storey carpark or school next to a residential block, no need to consult just build, if you look at the school in Marine terrace, when you hang out your clothes, the gala (bamboo) can be used as a baton to past to the children in the classroom, that is how close it is
 

I guess we got only ourselves to blame, because we are so bloody complacent, we continue not to be responsible citizen (throwing rubbish into drains - that made our Orchard road look like Venice), and etc
 

I just dont understand why with so little funding for hougang and potor pasir their estate is quite similar interms of cleaniness and maintenance
 

i just want someone in HDB to come out and answer these questions so that we low mortals can understand why our conservancy charges and car park charges cannot be lowered. If there is justification, we can then keep our mouth shut and accept the facts. Until then, is there any solution.
 

Most people who stay in HDB cannot have a choice, that is, there cannot move to private and hence at the mercy of HDB.

it seems not the case,

dont seem many around sucking thumb
 

recently

MRT got vandalised

government comes out (at these in the Straits Times) that it is the responsibility of the company

but hold on for a minute

this involves public transport

then though it is true that the vandal needs to be punish but the punishment seems severe
 

how about the spiderman, he would have planted or throw a bomb into a highrise 

why was he gotten off the a pat on the wrist
 

both are quite famous in their own right
 

this seems not revelant to the HDB issue but really there are similarities

there is a sizeable portion of people living in HDB having difficulties in making ends meet, deferring payment of conservancy is NOT a solution for most of them

if the maintenance cost is made reasonable and explanable

then we can only accept it without question

similar like the vandal and spiderman - why are punishing heartlanders (severely in some cases) while some heartlanders have multiple private properties are subsidized (i personally know a neighbour who is a multimillionaire over with several properties in Balmoral Road, Tanjung Rhu and Thomson collecting rents).
 
 
 

truly, i am not interested about political parties but whats more important is I thought civil servants are suppose to be servants of the people
 

this begs the question, is HDB public housing

I mean they can provide  evidence whether HDB residents are paying too much since they are in charge of the town council. If the report is from MIW town council, I just don't trust them.

The answer is very obvious. Yes. HDB residents are paying too much and LL have to continue to pay.

A resident of a similar-size flat in a typical condominium pays about $200 per month. But that includes water, electricity, maintenance, mandatory lift check, cleaning service every day,
 

....that's not right. Condo maintenance doesn't include those.
 

But, still, agree on the conservancy + parking being too expensive.
 

Actually, I think the parking is the main culprit.

If we base off S$200 a month for maintance for condo. we are indeed paying a lot for living in HDB.
 

Why?? cause if we include parking fee. we are paying around S$100.00 a month while those living in condo dont have to pay for car park. and consider we do not have free amendities like those condo.

think of it this way, and u will feel better.  when u buy condo, the parking lot is included in the selling price. that means 95x12x99=$112860. so condo is at least 112k more expensive than hdb.  then u compare the monthly maintenance fee $80 vs $200, the extra will be for facilities, environment, security. this will sound more reasonable.

wife and I both have cars as she does sales and I also stay pretty far from my work place, so the breakdown is:
 

$90 x 2 for carpark = $180

S&C= $50
 

Total that we are paying is actually $230.

Yes, cheaper than condo.

But Condo can park car next to lift lobby (most new condo). With shelter some more. Good for rainy day especially if you have kids.

To some, Condo more value for money.

because condo are typically 200K more expensive than HDB of the same size in the same area. so those who want to live in town area, cannot afford a condo there and dont want a condo in the out skirt.

This whole debate misses the point.
 

One is onli looking at the $/mth for HDB vs non-HDB, assuming they own a car.
 

For condo, u dun own car oso pay the same amt. For HDB, u dun.
 

For condo, the $$ goes towards upkeep of the carpark, M&E ventilation system, etc as that is part of the strata area. If got structural repairs, condo cannot run to ah gong to ask for $$ to repair. 
 

For HDB, the carpark is not part of the lessee's area. Hence, ah gong gotta maintain it. 
 

Cannot take extreme examples of $150/mth for some condo and then cry farder marder. Ave mass-mkt condo maintenance is >$300/mth. Many atas ones easily >$500. Again, no car oso no discount.
 

And lastly, dun forget the upfront savings in HDB price vs condo price. 
 

In fact, i think HDB more work to maintain than condo.

If you look at it from another view we are missing the point.

Condo, you got car or not, you still pay for the parking. hence its reasonable that we include car parking into the equation as this will show to us clearly that HDB are over charging us especially on the carpark.
 

Lets face it, how often do TC maintance the carpark? i tell you. in the 5 years i being living in current house. Only once. my father house?? 20 years there, only once. somemore now the Car park got one pot hole had been there for like 3 years now and nothing is done. 
 

BTW they did not even bother to catch those ppl without proper season ticket parking at season holder parking lot.

are we paying too much for our stay in HDB flats (applicable to those staying in HDB)
 

i keep getting this feeling but without concrete evidence that the answer is YES



 

YES, you are being ripped off.
 

I stayed in a small condo, paying $250 for 2 cars and full facilities and security, pool, tennis, etc.
 

Your HDB has volume and economy of scale, yet collect so much. You ask yourself: How frequent they clean the corridor? The lift? And the best joke, the carpark (which I think is always dirty - try leave a tissue and come back a few days later. The tissue will still be there.)
 

Probably sub-contract to some Beng-contractors with a couple of bangla workers to take care of x number of blocks - so cheap (but not necessary good). Where is the $ gone to then?

Probably sub-contract to some Beng-contractors with a couple of bangla workers to take care of x number of blocks - so cheap (but not necessary good). Where is the $ gone to then?




The best is cluster-house, full condo facilities, 2 DEDICATED car parks directly in front of your basement, paid only $300+.

it's behaviour of users that dirty the place..



 

Good for your estate.
 

All my siblings' estates (from CCK, to BP to Pasir Ris) all never clean daily one except the rubbish bins.

hehe mis-com here. this is what i mean 

think this is the best. owning the whole building hence really is living in a landed. but have the amentities of condo. best of both world. best thing is you got 2 personally parking lot unlike condo which only offer you 1. 
 

i think they called this strata housing too right?

Yes, cheaper than condo.

But Condo can park car next to lift lobby (most new condo). With shelter some more. Good for rainy day especially if you have kids.

To some, Condo more value for money.



 

actually i knew this all along... i wanted to see how people here respond. When I was living with parents in their condo, can park as many cars as you want. land area big, swimming pool, squash and tennis court, big park. Monthly maintenance only $200 plus. Liked that place so much that I think I will buy a unit there too. The estate has been constantly upgraded, even though its already 30 years old.

that is a valid observation. in condo postbox area, u dun see hoards of junk mail/flyers being strewn all over the place. u dun get urine smell in the lift. u dun get shoemarks or those paste-on ah beng ads all over the walls. the tiled floors are not constantly stained. that's why i say it's more work to maintain hdb than condo.

it is, but then again, I have to admit that the lifts in condos are almost always cleaner than those in HDB flats and I have always wondered why this is so. Social phenomenon or couldn't be bothered attitude. Common area plus you dun have a share in the estate, unless strata title housing

If you look at it from another view we are missing the point.

Condo, you got car or not, you still pay for the parking. hence its reasonable that we include car parking into the equation as this will show to us clearly that HDB are over charging us especially on the carpark.



 

u cannot incl carparking into the equation as the hdb lease agreement does not incl carparking. hence, lessees do not 'own' the carpark and the cost of land and constructing the mscp is not factored into the pricing of the flats. 
 

for condo, the carpark is part of the common strata area which owners have already paid for. different products altogether.

that's partly becoz condo owners do own the common areas via their strata share value. and ownership usually means better responsibility. for hdb, ah gong owns everything.

correct. mentality of singaporeans in general. the mscp that i use, some ppl jus leave unfinished coffee on the steps and it takes about a month for whoever is cleaning the place to clear it up. Ironically, i see fatimah more than the cleaners

 [laugh]  This is true. Last time we will brush it off as impossible.

Now, everything is possible.
 

My FIL taught me before. When buying a house or apartment, for good feng shui, the house must be sitting on a land that is higher than the main road. Lower will bring bad luck.

Now, it makes perfect sense.

unfortunately there is no evidence found 

worse then finding life on MARS

Actually for now, the lower the house, the more feng shui you get, especially when thunderstorm comes, sure get a lot of "feng" and "shui" .......

It's a hybrid between landed property and condo..the occupants need to be community and civic minded to be able to enjoy the benefits..most of the times the pple who stay will just leave the house door open..the problem comes when there are "unclean hands"  
 

so lock ur expensive watches and keep ur bags and wallets..even ur kids' toys might go missing

In a condo, they have what they call a resident committee where residents come down for meetings regularly for feedback and decisions including who to hire to oversee security and management of the condo.
 

What we do in hdb flat? nothing.
 

Basic point is if we could be more hardworking and go to meetings with town council one a month to see what they are doing or see what have they been doing with their funds then we probably could decide what to spend on and what not to spend one.
 

One thing is for sure. we need transparency.
