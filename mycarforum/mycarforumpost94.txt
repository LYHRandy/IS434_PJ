actually i have decided on No1. Loft at Lor 24.
 

i like it because of the unique design (more like a 2 storey unit cos typical loft allows u to look down from bedroom, this one is concealed) .. it is small for a 1 bedroom about 42sqm usable but i got the top corner unit w roofless balcony aka penthouse for less than 700K after discount.

geylang can only be cleaned up if the red light district is shifted.
 

however if you buy from lor 34-44 onwards it will be better.
 

FYI, lor 24 has alot of thai and indian chicken... which in turn means alot of bangalas and thai workers patronising there... it leads from mid of Lor 24 to almost the end before Mobil petrol station. in between there are 2 lanes which lead to the back door of the hotels in front. most of the houses are rented out cheaply.
 

maybe with the construction of your project, it be brighter and they may shift but it really depends.
 

For your consideration, if you have not sign the contract

If you look at this this way:  Govt is clearing old airbases, disused army camps, many golf courses, reclaiming seafront land along the east coast, etc just to house our rapidly growing population.
 

If they can do all of the above, will they let Geylang, situated inside the central region and with its proximity to the city and marina bay, remain as a red-light district?
 

I heard the red-light area will be shifted to Tuas or something.  It just doesn't make sense to leave Geylang as it is.  From an urban planning perspective, Geylang has got so much potential.

May I suggest moving the red-light district to Braddell Road or Ang Moh Kio GRC then?  Braddell already got one big brothel, they have space for several more.

just be careful with what you buy. was recently researching some properties there ... ie coffeeshop for sale, but turns out it is zoned residential (it was a shophouse though) but got permission to use as commercial ... so there's ABSD since it falls under residential category ><
 

also, quite a few buildings there have conservation status ... so keep that in mind when investing for "future" potential. there are a lot of costs to maintain a facade while upgrading the place internally.

Make sure that banks are willing to loan you hor.  from what i know, banks are not keen in this Geylang area. 
 

Cleaned up eventually?  yeah, but probably not within your lifetime. 
 

i dont know where lor 24 is.  Just make sure it's as near to MRT as possible.  This will only be your selling point.

I was planning to get a unit a couple of years ago befor the current property boom. It was only selling for 600 plus K for a  3 bedder and it's freehold as well.

I look at it this way. Gambling is nearby (RWS&MBS). So why keep the other pleasures of life so far away in Tuas? Both must go together la. That way, tourists after winning can go somewhere near to enjoy.

got la. uob n singapura finance.
 

it is better to take sibor or fixed interest rate if im only taking 60% loan?



 

Bro, for this case it depends on what is ur loan size and what do u want to do with your property few years down.
 

For fixed rate, ur locked into a package of 2-5yrs. which means that if you choose to refinance out, do partial payments or sell-off, you will have to pay a penalty fee, which is usually 1.5%. 
 

Of cos if your looking into security for the next few years and dont mind the higher rate rate for fixed package, then u may go for it. (Usually fixed rate are 1.3% on avg for the first few years)
 

Otherwise if you prefer to have the flexiblity of having partial prepayments or lesser years of lock in (eg 0-2yrs) and wouldnt mind the risk of rates fluctuating (internal board rate & 1/3 mths sibor) then you may go with Floating rates as currently they start off lower than fixed rates.
 

If you're taking only 60% loan, I believed that your looking into paying off your loan asap right? I would suggest going with Floating rates. Lemme know if you want a list of all the banks' rates bro. Hope this helps!

There will definitely be a machine room. But whether it's at the top or bottom of the block, you have to find out for yourself.

Man will live on the moon, eventually too. 

We will die, eventually too
 

Who doesnt know that?
 

So you like , you buy.

Life is full of half chances, yours as good as mine



 

I was also told the same thing, around 1994 when I was hunting for my first pte property. Saw Lor 6 units, and chicken fly dogs barked. fast forward to today, the place has gotten worse.

actually i have decided on No1. Loft at Lor 24.
 

i like it because of the unique design (more like a 2 storey unit cos typical loft allows u to look down from bedroom, this one is concealed) .. it is small for a 1 bedroom about 42sqm usable but i got the top corner unit w roofless balcony aka penthouse for less than 700K after discount.



 

A good bye,  er i mean good buy.

I think the whole Lor24 is chicken street, from Lai Meng Hotel at one end to Guillemard Rd at the other. The property TS looking at is nearer Lai Meng Hotel i think. Heard from sources quite a few of the old buildings along this Lor have been sold to developers recently.

If you look at this this way:  Govt is clearing old airbases, disused army camps, many golf courses, reclaiming seafront land along the east coast, etc just to house our rapidly growing population.
 

If they can do all of the above, will they let Geylang, situated inside the central region and with its proximity to the city and marina bay, remain as a red-light district?
 

I heard the red-light area will be shifted to Tuas or something.  It just doesn't make sense to leave Geylang as it is.  From an urban planning perspective, Geylang has got so much potential.




You are absolutely right.
 

The designated area is Kranji.
 

Lor 40 to 24 has already been cleaned up, the next step is 22 to 2.
 

If hard core horse racing gamblers have no problem getting there, hard core freelancer fans can also get there.

He added that HDB does give substantial price discount to eligible first-time home buyers. Housing grants for first-time Singaporean buyers can be as high as $60k.

Maciam hongkong? 
 

Those new condos be used as such?
 

My worry, pal sank money into one of these units? I tot ho say Liao. Oh oh.

Lively area with lots of love!!!



 

cos all the pros den will be bought by developer. how and where the pros want to work we cannot control. 
 

my guess is they will continue to live there, but activity will be elsewhere. 
 

if u ever lived in geylang, u will know some of them will be your neighbors. 
 

still, its a safer investment than msia.

Wow you are really the expert on all the lorongs in Geylang.
 

The point I was trying to make is the gov has cleaned up half of geylang already.
 

From 40 to 20 and the next step is 20 downwards.
 

From 20 to 0. Whether the last lorong is 6 or 4 or 2, that one I don't know!
 

But it means there will be no more vice in Geylang.

Hi, I'm a resident living in Jalan Suka, Lorong 24 and I've been here since the day I'm born.
 

For those who are considering to buy a property to live and invest, please do so with your eyes open.
 

The place is currently over-run by vice operators ... contraband cigarettes sellers, gambling dens and not forgetting the robust prostitution scene.
 

To learn more about the current state of affairs here, do check out my FB page, 'Save Jalan Suka - Lorong 24' if you want to learn more.
 

As for the 'rumors' that the area will eventually be cleaned up and that prostitution will be relocated, I seriously doubt so. I've been hearing the rumors for more than 20 years ago and the authorities here, i.e. SPF and URA have not done much in control the situation, in fact it's getting worse ...
 

For your consideration.

Wow.. Suddenly , so many mcfer have so much faith that the same government will be in power in 20-30 yrs .. and that all their plans including clearing up Geylang will eventually fulfilled ?
 

Aniway.. the opportunity cost /risk from now to when the place is eventually clear up is to high. Understand that you will have a big headache if there is any change plans within 20-30.. you will have a problem selling the property. 

And also, the upside of the property highly depends on what has not committed by the government.
 

I rather sink my $$ into L99 residents that are already near mrt or planned mrts.
 

We are already at 5 mil population. By simply increase 20% of the density of the current land that are zone i.e. plot ratio for these area at 1.4 to 2.x or 2.x to something bigger.. They could have enuff house for everyone. So how much "political will" they have to clear the area is still unknown until they announce details on their masterplan.

In my humble opinion, any part of Singapore also can buy.
 
The nuance in the motivation on buying a particular property is the one that sets out the different considerations to the buyer although most of these considerations would be somewhat similar...such as a buyer who intend to call the place a home would place emphasis on the surrounding environment just as much as an investor who intends to rent it out for revenue. 
 
Also, how much cash or disposable income the buyer has and the loan eligibility of the same and/or the banks' readiness to offer a loan, etc, is also a primary concern especially in that particular locality.

wan to buy any time can buy.
 
Buy now, can rent out. But, most likely it will end up as chicken farm.
 
After chicken farms cleared, can move back to live. But, need to do major cleaning and reno.
 

Geylang is still undergoing transformation. The best location is from lorong 34 all the way back to lorong 24. Need time for it to fully realise the value. Investing in Geylang is for long term 10-20 years down the road. not for the faint hearted.
 
Risk = potential.
 
Just look at the rental yield. 
Don't be mask by the current chicken farm situation. This will change once rental at shop house there make it not business visible to do business. More people move in, more demand for shophouse to be enbloc..the value of the chicken farm to go up also.
 
Then chicken farm have to go somewhere where rent is cheap...

Worse part is, after they move out, there would probably be still a lot of shady characters that would 'knock knock' since their associates & partners may not be aware or are 'convinced' that they have vacated the place.

exactly. it's the oldest profession. You "clean" up one area, they move to another to set up their practice.
 
That's why Singapore is very pragmatic, prostitution is not illegal here.

Geylang. Probably not the first place you think of when someone says the word “startup”, but here’s a quick tour we did to prove our point

Geylang property has been climbing upwards up to to-date regardless of the famous activity.  With the new upcoming shopping mall of One KM and Paya Lebar Square, i don't think property price there will down.

need advice from bros here,
 
there is a new project at Lor 27, which is next to Aljunied MRT. Land is freehold and around $1100psf.
 
whats your take on this? I went to survey a project at Lor 20 (behind shell )but was rather put off by the crowds there and of course, the activities around there...

hence the proposal to buy a unit there for investment. i guess due to the close proximity to mrt station, rental should be good?

Rental is not just about numbers.
If you got lousy tenant, you are in trouble too.
Late payments and messing up your place.
Factor that in, dont forget.
But when push comes to shove in this oversupplied market, landlord cannot choose.
I would rather a good tenant than 10% higher rental rates....
 
The area you buy will lead you to the tenants you rent to.
Didnt say cannot make money.
High risk high returns
But Beware.....

What a stupid report.
Property in Sentosa and Geylang is like sand and salt
Any comparison at face value like this report can only be read likewise, at face value.
 
 
 
So you bought an investment property already or not?

Ever since the alcohol ban, Geylang has been really quiet even on the weekends. In it's heyday, there were almost always traffic jams over the weekends. Now? Smooth traffic. I've talked to some business owners in the area, all suffering now. I have no doubt in the coming months, some will have to close their business. Rental will definately drop as well. So I would hold off till then.
