Since quite a few of us here have tenanted units, thought this would be a better platform to discuss this.  Been leasing out my units for a while and can compile a list based on anecdotal experience:
 
1.  Get to know your tenant
 
- It goes a long way.  I normally invite them out to dinner if they are new to the country and get to know them better.  This warms up the relationship so that there is mutual respect and understanding.
- Check on them regularly for the 1st few months to see if there are issues and they have settled in.  Most of mine have been Japs and they make excellent tenants
 
 
2.  Involvement in your property
 
- get involved in your property so that you are above on what is happening inside.  Try to attend AGMs as well as be part of the council if the opportunity arises.
- Makes the knowledge of your property and areas more transparent so that should the tenant need help, you are right there with the necessary guidance. 
 
 
3.  Do your homework
 
- if you are a green horn at leasing out, then you may engage a agent at first.  Know the TA and the entire due process.
- Learn how to manage and draft your own TA.  There are standard templates out there for you to take cue from.
- After the 1st lease, best to do your own so that the 2nd comm need not be part of the payment needed to be taken into account.
 
 
4.  Care of your property
 
- If this is the first property, then ensure that after 4/5 years you do a refresh of the unit if need be.  Do repairs, works so as to keep it up to the mark
- Manage defects well and itemise them and follow up regularly so that it is maintained
 
 
 
 
That's all I think I have off hand but the gurus like @throttle2 and @sp4wn can add on and oh, poonde @turboflat4 can ass
 
 
@ttl1976 you can come in later bro......and share some insights
 
 
 
Thanks and do add on so that we can learn.

Tenant will want peace and quiet. I certainly don't want my landlord to come bother me with gathering requests every now and then and I certainly don't want to know my landlord better on a personal level unless he's Warren Buffett

Tenants usually want to be left alone, unmolested, have peace and quiet, unless they have questions around the house/apartment/travel.
 
Landlord just want tenants to pay up rental promptly and not for tenants to be rowdy, cause trouble to neighbours, etc.

Hi,

extension of duration of tenancy agreement (ie you can specify that the terms for the expiring tenancy agreement are to remain in place for the "extension", and remember to pay stamp duty on the duration of the extension, otherwise, during any legal process, you will not be covered)
 
be sure to let them know that during the extension (say 6 months or whatever), you will be conducting viewings more frequently to find a more permanent tenant (or buyer for sale). put this as part of the extension contract, so you can ensure your property will have very little to no downtime. (i normally fix 1-2 days per week at a specific range of timing for the tenant to allow for viewings, and 100% of them will agree, as they know they are getting the extension from me without much hassle)

yes, otherwise if any issue comes up and your paperwork is not in order, you will have a hard time enforcing your rights.
 
your scenario also leaves you with no real knowledge of where you stand, and doesn't help with planning for rental/sale, since neither party stands here nor there.

of course. i have a big chain in my drawer. with a big padlock (complete with saw marks). i have had to take back premises quite a few times due to non-payments (several months overdue) and after going through the standard legal procedures, i just padlock the place and put the notice out of reach.
 
MOST tenants will immediately pay up if they have the cash, cos they want to avoid embarrassment. 
if they dont have the money, just tell them to clear their shit out and take back the place.. nothing worse than keeping a deadbeat tenant around, and taking them to court will be an even bigger waste of money.

stamp duty basically makes the document recognizable under the law. if you dont stamp, and then you decide you need to take back the premises, your lawyer will ask you for a copy of agreement + proof of stamp duty.
 
if the duty is not paid, both parties dont have a contract. 
 
anyone else - feel free to correct my example if i am wrong:
 
you have a tenant who agrees to rent your place for $3k. you and he both sign an agreement with 20 clauses, including payment every month. after the first 3 months of everything being rosy, the tenant doesnt pay you. in fact, he stops paying completely. if you had a valid agreement, your lawyer could advise you to re-enter and repossess the premises with a bailiff (they too, will ask for a copy to ensure they can assist with seizing the premises). 
 
however, if you dont have the duty paid, when you see the lawyer, most likely he will redirect you to IRAS, who will either fine you, or ask you to pay late charges (depending on how long overdue you are). only once that is settled, can the lawyer technically help you enforce the t&c of the tenancy. (otherwise, the tenant could just say you have a verbal agreement to delay payment for say .. 10 months or something). basically, it just complicates things.
 
besides, here, tenant always pays stamp duty. so i dont see why any landlord would not want to do it ...??
Wow! so much paper works to do and how to pay stamp duty? do I collect from tenants first? I am 1st timer on leasing. thank you
 
i think you can pay at the stamp duty office, or just get a lawyer to do it. there's some admin charge.

Agent will help do e-stamping for u and tenant pays. Juz ask for IRAS receipt otherwise the TA is not deemed 'legal'.

Tenants usually want to be left alone, unmolested, have peace and quiet, unless they have questions around the house/apartment/travel.

3.  Do your homework
 
- if you are a green horn at leasing out, then you may engage a agent at first.  Know the TA and the entire due process.

- After the 1st lease, best to do your own so that the 2nd comm need not be part of the payment needed to be taken into account.
 
 

 
Take note that a lot of agents will have it in the TA that they are entitled to commission if the tenancy is renewed. This is even though they dun need to do any additional work.
 
Best to strike it out in the first year to avoid dispute later on.

Hi,
Can advise me on what documents do I need to prepare and take from my  tenants as they want to extend for another few months after 2 years lease. thank you

I actually just use the previous TA and in the old days just "blanco" the dates and put in the new ones but nowadays with Word file just do the same .
 
I went down just a few weeks back to do a repeat TA and its quite fast to Stamp the docs at IRAS ... took me just about 5 mins and there is a portal i was told which we can DIY from the comfort of any home PC too; Only thing is that you have to have certain inputs ready like how many sq ft and ID of owner which is on TA already (usually)
Of late the rental market is really down, I got a local Tenant and he defaulted on the payment for last 2 months and used his deposit (1 month) to cover the loss and he still left the place like hell and cost me another $600-700 to do the place up to presentable state; Just got a new tenant last month and move in is only in end June some more-so my place is empty for almost 7 months, people can really low ball nowadays; I am not talking  about 10-15% of the last rent but like almost can go down to like 20-25%  and want some more lotsa freebees; Market damn "chialak" now  and KNN IRAS don't give claim back on unoccupied period and also maintainence builds up still and like kenna do gaurd duty everytime got viewing plus kenna mop/sweep/clean up if not all the "chichak" shit all over the place

dont use agency-provided TAs.
 
if you have a little budget, get a proper lawyer to prepare a decent one for you. then use that all the way (with tweaks here and there).
 
generally the TA should favour the landlord (but not very much so, because if everything is tipped in your favour, then during the legal process you will also have issues) and at the same time spell out what the tenant needs to do and adhere to during the term.

Asking 20 -25% less isn't lowball. It's the reality. Asking half of the comps in your area is lowball

My take is to lease if you can. It is better than leaving the unit empty. Many landlords are still in fairy wonderland thinking the rents have not dipped.

not really to avoid making any payment. It's a hdb and HDB has been informed. tax is 10%. basically what is happening is the family just continue staying with everything remaining status quo as per previous contract which was stamp but duration is 9 months, while they are applying for PR. Once PR approved, they will buy their own place. 
 
and under income tax, the receipts from my rental is included in my IR8A
 
If tenant don't pay me 1 month.. we can ask them to leave? Afterall they have 1 month deposit with us...

yup, gotta agree with @porker on this, the tenants I handle are mainly commercial, and I tend not to have any personal communications other than the occasional hello (only if I need something) as there have been instances of non-payments by tenants, but because they think they are my "friends", that I'll put in a word with my management to give them a break. So I learnt early on to ensure there's a decent barrier in between, if only, to make my job easier, if it ever comes to serving a letter of demand.
 
one other thing I've learnt, is to always, always, ALWAYS take pictures of every nook and cranny during handover. Give the tenant the same copies of the pictures via email (and be sure to add in words like "as per our joint inspection" etc) so that in the event they dispute anything 2 years later, your paper trail is not only accurate, but you sent them the relevant pictures and they had all the time in the world to revert, and that at the end of 2 years, it wont help if they decide they want to highlight an issue (unless there is undoubtedly a pre-existing issue in the pictures that both parties *may* have missed .. )
cant agree more

you asked for an example mah, so I just give you an example 
 
again, no tenancy agreement is always a bad idea. I cant emphasize this enough, but it is your prerogative. I do this for a living, and I wont allow anyone to occupy my premises without a proper TA and paid stamp duty in place.
 
I am not talking from the taxman perspective, since your tenancy agreement is different and we are discuss an entirely different situation / documentation (and like you said, you just declare the income and thats between you and the taxman).
 
yes, most tenancy agreements have a clause that state that in the event of non-payment of rent (OR non-performance of ANY clause) can be used to evict a tenant. but it is easy to say only. evicting a tenant is a lengthy and expensive process, if you wish to do it by the book. (have done before, both times tenants refused to leave after tenancy expired, and we charge double rental for holding over the property in the event the tenant doesnt return the premises on the expiry date) and yes, deposit cannot be used to offset rental (otherwise, they dont pay you 1 month AND they damage the place ... you will willingly LLST offset the rental and repair yourself?!) ... anyway just check the tenancy agreement .. most decent TAs will have this clause or something similar.
 
again, i can only advise you that its a bad idea not to have proper paperwork and stamp duty, even moreso now that you tell me you are renting a hdb, because those guys are damn by the book. anyway, your call bro.

you asked for an example mah, so I just give you an example 
 
again, no tenancy agreement is always a bad idea. I cant emphasize this enough, but it is your prerogative. I do this for a living, and I wont allow anyone to occupy my premises without a proper TA and paid stamp duty in place.

Since quite a few of us here have tenanted units, thought this would be a better platform to discuss this.  Been leasing out my units for a while and can compile a list based on anecdotal experience:
 
1.  Get to know your tenant
 
- It goes a long way.  I normally invite them out to dinner if they are new to the country and get to know them better.  This warms up the relationship so that there is mutual respect and understanding.
- Check on them regularly for the 1st few months to see if there are issues and they have settled in.  Most of mine have been Japs and they make excellent tenants
 
 
2.  Involvement in your property
 
- get involved in your property so that you are above on what is happening inside.  Try to attend AGMs as well as be part of the council if the opportunity arises.
- Makes the knowledge of your property and areas more transparent so that should the tenant need help, you are right there with the necessary guidance. 
 
 
3.  Do your homework
 
- if you are a green horn at leasing out, then you may engage a agent at first.  Know the TA and the entire due process.
- Learn how to manage and draft your own TA.  There are standard templates out there for you to take cue from.
- After the 1st lease, best to do your own so that the 2nd comm need not be part of the payment needed to be taken into account.
 
 
4.  Care of your property
 
- If this is the first property, then ensure that after 4/5 years you do a refresh of the unit if need be.  Do repairs, works so as to keep it up to the mark
- Manage defects well and itemise them and follow up regularly so that it is maintained
 
 
 
 
That's all I think I have off hand but the gurus like @throttle2 and @sp4wn can add on and oh, poonde @turboflat4 can ass
 
 
@ttl1976 you can come in later bro......and share some insights
 
 
 
Thanks and do add on so that we can learn.

 
I wouldnt go and have dinner with them. But I do assess their profile. A small family of 3 or a couple is usually my preferred choice of tenants. I do not rent out to tenants from 2 countries that start with letter C and P. C has a habit of becoming 二房东, and P I just dont like them  
 
I keep my unit as simple and clean as possible, not overload with too many fancy stuffs or fancy renovations. Ideally rent out the unit as partial furnished because tenants have different preference in furnishing and some like to leave unnecessary items behind after the lease end. If you have an agent representing you get him or her to sort it out or liaise with tenant agent. Less things also mean less dispute over items damaged and the need to take care of it. 
 
First impression is very important, other than location and the rental price. Repaint the house after some years renting out. Ensure air con servicing are done properly by the tenants. If you want can always do a chemical wash if it is not being done for x years. Typical repairs on toilet bowl seat cover, toilet door, tap, kitchen hob etc must be maintained. Most importantly keep the unit neat and clean and not clustered with useless things. 
 
Just put ourselves in their shoes and think of what we want as tenants. Most likely that is also what they want too.

I never meet my tenants. Only have photographs of them, copies of their passports  work permits, etc...
I keep it impersonal by letting agent manage everything; easier to handle if tenant start giving troubles or having excessive demands.
 
My agent knows my requirements; like no subletting, preferably couple/family, no cats.  For dogs, must produce vaccination certificate, dog Licence, undertaking that if there's complaint, the animal goes. Also, tenant has to agree to doors/ door frames, etc. If damaged by scratches.  
Also preferably no PRCs & those fr banana land (too much merry making)....usually they would sublet or turn the apt into a boarding house or mini kampong. 
 
Have friends who rent out theirs with furniture but I only provide basics like good sized fridge, oven, stove, washer, dryer, curtains.  Wardrobe already inbuilt. Rather rent lower without the trouble of maintaining/ disposing used furnitures. 
 
After every round of end of contract, I would engage handy men to to minor repairs/ touch ups, etc.
Believe & hope that if I provide a nice clean apt, ready for immediate move-in condition, tenant would continue to maintain the place.

My life also bad.
I had a very bad experience with my ex-landlord.
Ended up going to SCT currently.
 
I rented a new place 2 weeks before my contract end for the unit I m renting from this landlord. Spent time to clean up the house and engaged professional cleaner to do cleaning before handover.
 
I m very happy with the end result of course.
On the date of the handover, items like
 
Ikea plastic shoes cabinet turned yellow
fine markings on white wall
fine scratch on fridge door
house doesnt feel clean enough
..... etc. came up on the defect list.
 
I agreed to do repainting the whole house and replaced the items including the fridge. Thinking as long i rectified the items, I should be able to get my security deposit back. Although the contract stated that fair wear and tear is acceptable, and everyone has their own guideline of wear and tear, i dont wish to argue over this....
 
Then, the agent and landlord went radio silence for 1 month after I have rectified the defects. Then..... an email with more defects found was sent to me. Of course I was pissed. Set a dateline for them and again, no reply till the dateline. Went to SCT and issued the notice to them.
 
That very night, another email with more defects came but this time with an option to claim back my security deposit, but have to minus away all the cost for rectifying the new defects.

Your earlier threads did mention how you did your own rentals, sourcing tenants etc and give fruit basket...

@Radx I steal your format ah, good topic btw  
 
 
1.  Get to know your tenant
 
- I task my wife to send greeting cards too my tenant, if they have a newborn I'll send mothercare or massage vouchers. Seems extravagant but they pay me good rent and been with me > 6 yrs. Want to keep them happy
- no qualms about meeting the tenant but I let them initiate any meetups / dinners so they feel they are in control
- I have tenants which agent manage and some that I manage, all have my personal number but for agent handled I encourage they go to agent directly.
 
2.  Involvement in your property
 
- I speak to some members of the MCST and give them my voting rights, as I don't live on the estate don't want too be on the committee. (plus the one time I attended an MCST they tried to make me chairman knn)
 
 
3.  Do your homework paperwork
 
- Ensure you keep and scan all related TA, stamp duty etc of the property
- File everything properly (electronically) so they can be retrieved easily
- Track how much you spend on anything relating to the property to claim back during tax filing
 
4.  Care of your property
 
- Keep a list of contacts to service the property, air con, plumbing, electrics, carpenter, painter, pest control etc
 i.e had to replace the rubber seal on the bomb shelter, even SCDF didn't have the contact ask me to call the door manufacturer. Lucky found one ah seng who can sort it out.
- Always fix big issues on the property asap, if tenants pay on time landlords are obliged to fix issues on timely also.
 
that's my 2 cents, take with salt cause when I also like too Tkss one.  La La La

How much do you usually spend (as a % to your rental income)? Below 15% (not including interest expense) dun need to provide proof for residential rentals.

Next time strike off landlords with cheap furniture (especially those from ikea). They think the rent can be higher with cheap furniture not knowing they have poor taste and are more likely than not calculative. I've seen landlords of premium apartments use really awful looking cheap furniture and ask a premium of $500 because the apartment is fully furnished.

 I ever encountered an owner shifting his unwanted sofa set from his landed house to his 2 bedder unit that is for rental and taking up huge amount of living room space. It is not just the size, with the unit being new and old furniture, totally doesn't fit in at all.

I'm interested to know how it is resolved.
 
Next time don't do anything if you feel the landlord is being unreasonable. Tell them to claim from your deposit but all work must first be approved by you.

For this year I take an example without interest expense break down as below, but the rent on this property not high cause the interior is kind of chui  
 
P.Tax      - 6.68%
MCST    - 10.44%
Others   - 1.11%
Repairs - 5.31% (had to change an Ac)
 
But anyway I track all property expenses if cost <15% I will whack 15% which ever is higher

I bought an unit near Zion Rd and rented rooms out while I occupied one
my tenants were SIA girls . . . .
I was single, thus I never left my room doors locked at night . . .
I remembered those Friday nights in Zouk . . . . never gone there or walked home alone
and Sat morning . . .  never do breakfast alone too 
but in the end, I was always shortchanged from rentals . . .

the easiest way is to give the tenants a budget, and ask them to whatsapp you for final approval before purchase.
 
we do give some bigger tenants a small budget to outfit the homes if they take a slightly longer lease, subject to our final approval for their "taste" in furniture. so far, this has worked wonders as it makes the tenant happy. the items are added to OUR inventory list at the end of the day as well, and most tenants wont buy cheap stuff for themselves.

1st, it's not comprain lahhhh; it was mutual agreements bet. professional matured adults 
then it wasn't collection, but rather social interpretations
and I dunno what other words besides "shortchange" being applied ... 
afterall it was so many years ago
lastly, its still a lesson learnt from being a good landlord; when relationships come in between contract (i.e. rental), then it gotta be mitigated liao . . 
  
Did you live like this?
  
no lahhhh!
usually when A & B share to rent the room, they hardly meet bcoz of their different schedules
but when they meet, they could most probably discover the truths about each others and their frens too
this was where the perfect storm arises . . . . . 
those were the days ...

Really like the 1st point.  Esp the dinner and warm up part. If the tenant renew direct, the dinner pays for itself. And like what Kusje reminded, strike out the renew fee from the TA. TA is abt the relationship bet you and the tenant, but agents love to sneak in some phrase in between.
Questions; How do you get the contact of the tenant? ask from the  agent?

absolutely nothing. how is it your fault if they are posted overseas? they should be informing their own company management of costs incurred while overseas, and the LL should not have to bear such cost.
 
when you mean its in-between a TA .. meaning currently no TA?

My friend kenna from a "japanese" tenant. Passport day japan but actually from China. How is it possible ? 
Anyway very demanding & unreasonable tenant. After contract signed started to show true colors & churn pattern.

Sorry i wasn't clear - it is in the middle of an 18-mth TA that is in force.
 
I also dun wanna budge, and they initially said if that's the case, they'll struggle but still continue. Then later said, it will be tough on them and they will move out, and will help me to find an anchor tenant to replace them. This is the 3rd contract they signed with us. The most recent one even asked us to replace the sofa (which admittedly the 3-seater of the 3+1+1 is quite worn out), apart from asking for a 11% reduction in rent... We just replaced the full-leather set with an affordable one...

Japanese doesn't mean must be real Japanese.
 
Could be foreigners converted to Japanese citizenship.
 
There are plenty in Tokyo and Yokohama now; mostly PRC, also have Koreans, Taiwanese, Malaysian...
 
My friend kenna from a "japanese" tenant. Passport day japan but actually from China. How is it possible ?Anyway very demanding & unreasonable tenant. After contract signed started to show true colors & churn pattern.So those who lease out better be wary ... Even profile can be faked ! :)

then you have to decide...
 
1) are they good paymaster? (since they have been with you for 3 terms)
2) whats the discount? 5%? 10%? (if small amount, maybe have to give and take)
3) let them know that them finding a new "anchor tenant" doesnt absolve them of liability till the new tenant takes over, pays the deposit, rental in advance and takes on the same terms with the remaining duration (or you can be nice and offer the same rental for a new, fresh duration, ie another 18 months). any commission / other related expenses to be paid for finding the new anchor to be borne solely by them and NOT deductible from deposit
 
if you already gave 11% discount and they are still struggling, might be better to accept a newer tenant at the same rent, rather than to keep the ones who can pay (provided all replacement exp borne by out going tenant)
 
(i just did the above recently, as current tenant owed a lot of money and couldnt pay .. so quickly got in a better tenant at 10% haircut, old tenant paid all the relevant expenses ... better than having the old tenant owing me 2-3 months rental)

Tks...
 
They have been mostly ok, paid promptly except once, when they were overseas (and i didn't even realise it until they apologized…). But often said got relatives visiting every year. Then like i said, 3rd TA asked for reduction, citing market trend. To avoid gap in rental, my agent advised us to accept it. Then asked for sofa replacement. Also complain my aircon not v cold. The a/c tech (who also services my a/c) said they were asking whether the unit is faulty - must be trying to find a reason to ask us to replace it… In the end, we just did chemical wash per the tech's advice.
 
My wife quite pissed off with their various requests, so we decided not to accede to their request (which he didn't give a specific reduction amount except saying 'maybe a few hundreds' - as they occupy only one room). 
 
If the company is posting them overseas for 3 mth, surely they will continue to be paid, and their accommodation there should be covered. Like you said, I shouldn't be subsidizing their rental here. But I suspect that it is only one of the couple who will be posted, while the wife is probably taking no-pay leave to follow, so they might feel the pinch. But if it's their choice, then they have to bear with it - shouldn't be me...

correct la ... overseas posting is def company cover. so they trying to squeeze you. 
 
personally, i'll tell them to fly kite. but depends on your situation. but dont let the tenant get the upper hand and you should be fine. sometimes got to be firm, but also temper with some logic. if they can prove by paperwork that they have to pay for overseas accomodation (let's say they are paying $500/mth for 3 months), you can say, as a goodwill, you will minus $200 from the next bill ONCE. thats the only goodwill you can do (or whatever arbitrary number you wish to come up with)

Did the request to change sofa etc come after verbally agreeing on reduction of rental? If yes then I think your agent is not doing a good job for you. Before any discussion of renewal your agent must make sure if there is any additional request first. All this come into play when it comes to renewal and rental price.

No, the request came together. The tenant wasn't hostile, but just told my agent that rental has softened, and they intended to find a cheaper place, but since my place was good and convenient, they wanted to check if i would agree to reducing the rental so that they will have no reason to move. And they actually asked to replace the old sofa and get a couple of fans (saying the a/c was not v cold…). We only agreed to reducing the rental (in line with market rates) and replacing the sofa...

quite a fair compromise on your part as landlord. As for fans they can always get it themselves. And it's not expensive for them to buy too.

Yes I had one prospective come to view my place like that also....Agent said Korean....... but when Tenant come in he started talking to his wife in Mandarin.....anyway it did not work out; I asked Agent why they talking in Mandarin.... She said that the husband deals in Ginseng ... but anyway it did not work out.  Many of them also say they are American citizens but actually Indians settled in USA as professionals and posted in SGP.
 
But the rental market really sucks now. So many vacant units around "itching" for tenants and tenants also taking full advantage of the situation too; Has been like this for last 2-3 years; but not so bad until like now...... really "teruk"

Landlords being nice does not do gd if the tenants are mean. This only makes them even more cocky as in the case of my friend. Complain < 2 yr old just sys 1 air con not cold. After chem wash etc insist on replacing new one. Long waiting period of 3 wks then cpcb. 
End up realise the tenant cheapo use Groupon air con servicinf @$15 type. Con job, & some might even damage it or sabo & advise tenant saybokd ask for replacement etc. so better chk yr tenant servicing receipts if contractor is creditable type ... 
End of it, my friend give notice to the fake japanese tenant n kick out. After enduring the crap for few mths, shiok n say worth it.

This kind of situation boils down too bargaining power (i,e attractiveness of the location and vacancy within the locality) and the agent to screen out troublesome buggers. Its a balance of the two, if one lacks the former than have to make up for in the latter. (i,e find a good agent and stick with them)
 
One thing Singapore property management companies have yet to do is have background/referrals of potential tenants, quite common in Aust/Uk where tenants are hard too evict.

extension of duration of tenancy agreement (ie you can specify that the terms for the expiring tenancy agreement are to remain in place for the "extension", and remember to pay stamp duty on the duration of the extension, otherwise, during any legal process, you will not be covered)
 
be sure to let them know that during the extension (say 6 months or whatever), you will be conducting viewings more frequently to find a more permanent tenant (or buyer for sale). put this as part of the extension contract, so you can ensure your property will have very little to no downtime. (i normally fix 1-2 days per week at a specific range of timing for the tenant to allow for viewings, and 100% of them will agree, as they know they are getting the extension from me without much hassle)

Thanks for replying bro

I actually just use the previous TA and in the old days just "blanco" the dates and put in the new ones but nowadays with Word file just do the same .
 
I went down just a few weeks back to do a repeat TA and its quite fast to Stamp the docs at IRAS ... took me just about 5 mins and there is a portal i was told which we can DIY from the comfort of any home PC too; Only thing is that you have to have certain inputs ready like how many sq ft and ID of owner which is on TA already (usually)
Of late the rental market is really down, I got a local Tenant and he defaulted on the payment for last 2 months and used his deposit (1 month) to cover the loss and he still left the place like hell and cost me another $600-700 to do the place up to presentable state; Just got a new tenant last month and move in is only in end June some more-so my place is empty for almost 7 months, people can really low ball nowadays; I am not talking  about 10-15% of the last rent but like almost can go down to like 20-25%  and want some more lotsa freebees; Market damn "chialak" now  and KNN IRAS don't give claim back on unoccupied period and also maintainence builds up still and like kenna do gaurd duty everytime got viewing plus kenna mop/sweep/clean up if not all the "chichak" shit all over the place     

Thanks for replying bro
