Living with Less
 
 
 
 

I LIVE in a 420-square-foot studio. I sleep in a bed that folds down from the wall. I have six dress shirts. I have 10 shallow bowls that I use for salads and main dishes. When people come over for dinner, I pull out my extendable dining room table. I don

if we calculate by per person per size, it will be about 1350sqft for me alone. 

anyway, if a person is so damn rich, do you think he/she will buy a 450sqft home? it is not that possible, IMO.
 

during the olden times, the house is rather simple, a living room, a kitchen, bedrooms, a study room and toilets. that's all.

today, houses are filled with gym set, TV room, computer room and etc. with all these space plays an important role.

we cannot be possibly transform a bedroom to a TV room and vice versa within a short time. people want to enjoy life in a quicker pace.

it is sad but true fact that people are improving with the technologies.
 

most importantly, in today's market situation, buying properties are somewhat related to investment.

this is very different from the olden days where, you just need a hut, a truck, a farm and filled with animals.

I agree. When I was single I tend to accept a lot less. I don't mind not having a car and take public transport. I can walk for 20 mins instead of taking feeder bus of 2 to 3 bus stops ride. I don't mind if I have a bed frame or not. I don't mind using a very normal phone. And still using a desktop. 
 

Now? Cannot. Not when I am married and have kids Liao. Even if I can accept less for myself, I cannot accept less for my kids and of course my wife, though i know my wife can also accept less for herself too. This is a fact. Call it kaisu or whatever but that is a fact.

I think alot of ppl read this article but none know this guy out of this article or have even seen his place. Well, for a start he is quite a well known person on the Internet and have done talks on TED. 
 

I feel it's easy for a person like him who has been there and done that. If you further research about him and have a look on YouTube, you will see him talk about his home. There are alot of good customized parts that are movable and well done. It's not done cheaply. 
 

 So if you asked me, is he living less with less space and material items than before? Sure, is his home cheap and simple for common folks like us who might want to have less materials? That might not be the case. 
 

It might be simple but not cheap or affordable. His home might just be more expensive than a fully decked out 4 room HDB.

There is a difference between living a life full of excesses and a life with sufficient necessities. To an average-income family which chooses the former, it will have little resources left for other non-material  things essential for a balanced life. Such a family's home may be filled with the latest gadgets etc, but lacks space/time for really good stuff like peace of mind, time for loved ones /friends, etc.
 

However, it's still to each his own.

Article is right... we have tendency to hoard too many material possessions (even things of little value, actually) that end up cluttering our lives and increasing stress. Not just in our homes, but also our workplaces (take a look at your desk/cubicle!) 
 

I really admire those people who can really chuck away things that they are fully confident that they don't need. Their homes have wide open floors, coffee tables free of clutter... very refreshing.

Depends on the interior design of that house. Some are so well designed that they look really cosy and comfortable to live in.
 

I have friends who stay in shoebox with his wife and a kid. No problem at all. He made good use of vertical space, and has a lot of "smart" compartments, like  a study table that could turn into a single bed with a twist of a lever. The partition between his living and master bedroom is movable and motorised.  Entire partition can be move forward or backwards depending whether he wants more space in the living or the master bdroom. Very cool.
 

So it is possible with a kid, just need more thoughts in the interior design.

the cost of customising such an interior?   vs just buying a normal cupboard and storage boxes from ikea.
 

want to wash the house? Don't need 1 pail/mop? Got car? lagi best. need 2 pails.

Want to cook for family of 3? Don't need a bigger fridge to save on grocery trips?

Want to go overseas for whole family? don't need 1 x large luggage minimum?

Vaccum cleaner? Not everyone can afford Roomba/Scooba.
 

We don't live in temperate climate whereby 1 pair of jeans can wear for entire winter. And just need 1 x jacket.
 

I'm all for reducing waste. Since my early 20s, i've minimised buying stuff which i think i won't use often. 

But even then some clutter is expected in a live in home.
 

Sure can have fancy storage options. Oh but guess what.

Every night before can pull down your bed, must clear the floor. Must constantly figure out where to squeeze in other bulky items.
 

U have 1 x kid, the clothes which he/she outgrown can already stack up after few yrs. Give to salvation army? Sure, if u only plan to have 1 x kid. Get 2nd kid then buy again ar? So which is more wasteful.

In the end, all these stuff are placed in storage boxes in their parent's place.
 

If u've lived long enough, u realised some clutter is actually useful. We've reused quite a lot of things that we only re-discovered after some years in storage instead of buying. And that is actually reducing WASTE.

wife keeps asking me to buy a landed property - I insisted no.
 

I don't see the need for such a big space for nothing. I'd rather buy a condo in a prime location than a landed. the maintenance and all.... just not my cup of tea. 
 

I also don't need a lot of things. In fact I concur with the author. Used to buy expensive and branded furniture and all...... nowadays just get whatever that works and looks nice in the house can already. BUt will still spend some money on design.

you must be realistic

some families do not have a choice
 

of course if possible everybody wants to live in a bigger home
 

as to clutter, it is unavoidable

but if you are in position (normal person with normal IQ) that requires you to clear your clutter, soon or later you will clear the clutter

Just threw out tons of stuff from my house I've been staying in for 12 years. Unbelievable amount of junk we think we would use, or things bought we thought would be useful but ends up in a drawer or a corner of a cupboard somewhere. I think it's the human psyche of acquisition.
 

Clothes, books and other re-usable stuff donated.

All Praise be to PAP !!!



 
 

Hongkee use to have real homes but their liking for gambling/property speculation cause most to loss all away .

1st gen PAP did an honest job on housing. Today's old citizens can attest to it with their home and completed loans . 
 

As for recent housing policy from PAP. MBT refuse to built for like 5 years and first few BTO balloting ratio for   first timer was 40 to 1 . Our housing price  shoot to the sky as suddenly there is huge demand but no flat supply.   After 3 years of selling high price BTO the demand  tamper today.   MBT went hongkong to learn unfortunately get replace before he can start to order cages. Now Khaw BW  planning for 'cheap' BTO to help us. 
 

I foresee after Khaw helping , all houses built  then on will only be  shorter lease like 60 years .

in fact a recent newspaper article featured a caucasian fellow who started this high end customisation for shoeboxes in singapore after he couldn't find anything in singapore that suited what he wanted.

I think more expensive than sungei kadut furniture bah   
 

If u've been reading home & reno websites, u realise there are many people genuinely trying to live in a smaller space. Those people use cheap ikea hacks and compromise.

But they do this out of need and the results are creative and cool. I don't think any of them are trying to boast they are downsizing and preaching to others.

Hongkee use to have real homes but their liking for gambling/property speculation cause most to loss all away .

1st gen PAP did an honest job on housing. Today's old citizens can attest to it with their home and completed loans . 
 

As for recent housing policy from PAP. MBT refuse to built for like 5 years and first few BTO balloting ratio for   first timer was 40 to 1 . Our housing price  shoot to the sky as suddenly there is huge demand but no flat supply.   After 3 years of selling high price BTO the demand  tamper today.   MBT went hongkong to learn unfortunately get replace before he can start to order cages. Now Khaw BW  planning for 'cheap' BTO to help us. 
 

I foresee after Khaw helping , all houses built  then on will only be  shorter lease like 60 years .



 

Not shorter lease but smaller BTOs 

TS kept on stirring this small is good shiit 

Maybe is preparing the ground for kbw's announcement?

Six month ago Khaw already announce fixing the flat size (after strong feedback flats hdb building smaller flat ) so unlikely to touch the size for the time being.
 

For his latest new 'affordable' BTO ie 30% cheaper, he give three option . The main dish is shorter lease.

sometimes its difficult for people who have lived in high ivory towers to understand what is happening on the ground... this Graham guy is the best example. 
 

he might think that he is living less.. but actually he is not and with a sense of being aloof.

What's the big deal with living with a lot less space?
 

Try living with a lot less money.




Same for car:-   No big deal to go from a big, or fast, or flashy car to a smaller, slower,or duller car....  Men are adaptable, especially when they don't really have a choice     If they feel "lose face", that's a separate matter, more to do with their emotions and feelings, not physical needs.

Depends on the interior design of that house. Some are so well designed that they look really cosy and comfortable to live in.
 

I have friends who stay in shoebox with his wife and a kid. No problem at all. He made good use of vertical space, and has a lot of "smart" compartments, like  a study table that could turn into a single bed with a twist of a lever. The partition between his living and master bedroom is movable and motorised.  Entire partition can be move forward or backwards depending whether he wants more space in the living or the master bdroom. Very cool.
 

So it is possible with a kid, just need more thoughts in the interior design.




Yes, agreed.
 

Smart designs may cost more, but the really smart ones are value for money. The users pay a bit more for efficient and friendly designs.
 

A friend converted part of his room to a slight split-level floor, and use the space below the raised floor to store stuff which he doesn't use everyday  
 

The Japanese are good at such space saving designs, and also at creatuve use of visual tricks to make small spaces look big.

the cost of customising such an interior?   vs just buying a normal cupboard and storage boxes from ikea.
 

want to wash the house? Don't need 1 pail/mop? Got car? lagi best. need 2 pails.

Want to cook for family of 3? Don't need a bigger fridge to save on grocery trips?

Want to go overseas for whole family? don't need 1 x large luggage minimum?

Vaccum cleaner? Not everyone can afford Roomba/Scooba.
 

We don't live in temperate climate whereby 1 pair of jeans can wear for entire winter. And just need 1 x jacket.
 

I'm all for reducing waste. Since my early 20s, i've minimised buying stuff which i think i won't use often. 

But even then some clutter is expected in a live in home.
 

Sure can have fancy storage options. Oh but guess what.

Every night before can pull down your bed, must clear the floor. Must constantly figure out where to squeeze in other bulky items.
 

U have 1 x kid, the clothes which he/she outgrown can already stack up after few yrs. Give to salvation army? Sure, if u only plan to have 1 x kid. Get 2nd kid then buy again ar? So which is more wasteful.

In the end, all these stuff are placed in storage boxes in their parent's place.
 

If u've lived long enough, u realised some clutter is actually useful. We've reused quite a lot of things that we only re-discovered after some years in storage instead of buying. And that is actually reducing WASTE.



 

Yes, I believe customising such interior can be expensive.  But don't forget that the owner would have save quite a bit of $$$ from buying a shoebox apartment as compared to say something that is 900-1100 sqfeet.
 

Some people prefer not to splash out too much $$$ for a bigger house since properties are expensive, but don't mind using that saving through shoeboxes and spend more on a reno that they truly like.
 

And when I look at my friend house, it looks really comfortable with his wife and a kid. His reno is about 100k,  he has the cash, but his housing loan is pretty small since the shoebox overall price is not that high.

Cluster house is priced more like apartment not landed. Different.

Most cluster terraces / semi ds are built on a small floorplate no more than 1000sft.

By stacking up, they achieve a high GFA of > 3500sft but each floor feels small.
