newspapers always like to highlight those successful ones hor?
 

what about those who din make it?
 

maybe for every successful one,  there are 100 who fail
 
 

eg brilliant graduates earn 8k per month in their first job
 

eg successful stock brokers earn 50k per month
 

can also say lucky punter win 1m from casino

Take this article with a pinch of salt.
 

Highly sensationalised.
 

Hardly any 2% commission now. Industry norm is 1%, and if you co-broke, you end up with only 0.5%commission, excluding the % share you have to give to your real estate company.
 

Whatever you earn excludes all running cost, like ad cost, petrol etc.
 

If being a property agt can make money, 40% of agts would not have withdrawn from the industry since 2010 when CEA rules came into play.

in any "agent" business ... there is a huge gap between the top 20 vs mediacore 80
 

property agent

insurance agent

bank/investment product sales agent

car sales agent

luxury watch sales agent

the top 20 are in the million dollar table ... annual income can exceed $1M

the mediacore 80 earn far less than the top 20 ... huge huge gap

it's a fair game. no risk no gain. high risk high gain.

why property agent, insurance agent, etc can earns few hundreds thousands a year

if it is so easy, everyone can be agent liao instead of 9-to-5 salaried workers (steady income and the meagre 2-4% salary increased, etc)
 

similarly, i cannot agree why a footballer can make 10/20/30 millions a year

are they so genius that could change the world?

no, but that is a talent that not everyone can have ... and in fact almost 90% fail make it to the end

those who make it to the end get the oyster

The 9-to-5 salaried worker may have other attractive things like family time, time to pursue own interests, etc.
 

But maybe the newspapers don't consider this as interesting to the common people, who are only focused on $ as indicator of success.
 

Life is all about making choices.

look at it like ministers and normal civil servant. millions vs few k per month. and u will find the income gap for property agents is more jialat. it's no walk in the park but as for every other business, the ones who make it will be minority. 
 

actually it's probably better for agents cos business start up cost not as high as starting own company. thats y SG has very few entrepreneurs & a whole lot more agents just to try out.

allow me to weight in in this topic as i'm a property agent myself. been working full time for 1 year and before that part time for 2 years(abt 6 months active, on and off)
 

from Jan 13 till date i have closed about 4 deals and 5 rentals. my pay? a little shy of 80k. this is my revenue. now lets move on to my expenses.

Car( typically a must for salesperson. a car left with 2 more years. bought it at 17k) 300+ per month

Petrol close to 300 per mth

I rent my own office with my colleague so that i can work in peace and without distractions. need a hell lot of discipline to work from home. 370 per mth

Marketing expenses - propertyguru account, streetsine account. SPH, agent fee reneal etc etc etc. abt 600 per mth.

this means i am investing abt 1800 per mth. 
 

i have experienced earning 30k per mth. and not closing anything for 5 months. the stress level is extremely high. and u might work ur ass off and incurred thousand of dollars just to get back nothing. worse, u might get played out by fellow agents or even buyers/sellers, basically u canot rest a case and celebrate before your commission is in because anything can happen to spoil your deal and ANYTHING will happen.
 

The Pro side? - sense of satisfaction( believe me when i said this. u will feel really happy when u managed to help your buyer/seller get a good deal) . Out of the rat race( provided u work hard enough and not wait for the deals to come to you. Sharing my knowledge about market movement with friends and advise them whenever necessary. a pro/con side is the time is all yours. which can almost mean u can laze around at home during monday blues, or work in front of the computer from 6am-5am per day. 
 

Hope this clarify some thoughts that we proerty agents are way overpaid and its a damn good industry .

after making $30K comms, most of it throw into a car? does not sound savvy leh?
 


The biggest sale he has made is a bungalow in the Bukit Timah area, which fetched $9 million. To close that deal, it took about three months. 

For his efforts, he received about $30,000 in commission, most of which went towards paying for a new car, he says. But it's not easy money, he insists.

yeah, those diver-cleaner who scrub ship's bottom and propeller should be able to earn this amount. But, risk is very high.



 

Actually diver pay depends on whether air dive or sat dive. Usually for cleaning ship, they will go dry dock and spray off, so don't need diver for such missions. 
 

Salvage is one good place to earn money. Even salvage rubbish from bottom of the ocean can earn big bucks. But also depend on salvage from what depth. Air dive usually USD $200 - $300 a day, sat dive from USD $800 - 1500+++, more if you can do underwater welding or underwater technical jobs. But risk is death from a lot of things. And long term sat dive very jia lat one, live in compressed container inside a ship for a few weeks, eat, s--t, sleep, PCC all got camera for people to watch you. Even s--t and shower!! Coz if anything happen, they need to send in medical officer or medical supplies. 
 

So, one short month of work, can earn more than most people work in a year, but with many medical risks, see whether one want to take it up or not lor.

ur welcome.
 

not really. actually to be a property agent u need to be both physically trained and mentally trained. physically trained - for u to still be smiling after having 7-8 appointment in a day . mentally trained to negotiate deals or to counter objections and solve issues. afterall our jobs is to facilitate a smooth transaction.
 

unless u have loads of friends who have afew millions dollars to spare in their bank and asking them to buy units(commercial or residential) is just like buying veg in the market. den yes. do it. u can earn alot of money.

Aiyoh, can post the picture of the article without your hand / rolex? I want to read, haha..



 

in a nutshell, property agents were found to have made inducement payments to some owners in thomson view to get them to agree to the enbloc sale. those few owners would bring the overall number of agree votes to above 80%. high court held that these few owners consent no count.
 

and that the property agent has breached its duty of good faith to the owners of thomson view.

Actually diver pay depends on whether air dive or sat dive. Usually for cleaning ship, they will go dry dock and spray off, so don't need diver for such missions. 
 

Salvage is one good place to earn money. Even salvage rubbish from bottom of the ocean can earn big bucks. But also depend on salvage from what depth. Air dive usually USD $200 - $300 a day, sat dive from USD $800 - 1500+++, more if you can do underwater welding or underwater technical jobs. But risk is death from a lot of things. And long term sat dive very jia lat one, live in compressed container inside a ship for a few weeks, eat, s--t, sleep, PCC all got camera for people to watch you. Even s--t and shower!! Coz if anything happen, they need to send in medical officer or medical supplies. 
 

So, one short month of work, can earn more than most people work in a year, but with many medical risks, see whether one want to take it up or not lor.



 

can recommend me this job anot?

Ho ho. Since you obviously don't know T2, let me introduce you two: HC meet T2. He likes Lolexes and cigars. Asking him to post a photo without a Lolex or a cigar is like asking him to pose naked. 



 

at least he share pictures of his wife..so not too bad

Saturation diving sibeh siong, much respect. 
 

You can try those salvage companies, but i think the big international salvors usually take people with experience. Good thing is most of them have bases here.
 

Start with the small local contractors first lor, good if you have lots of diving experience (preferably with technical diving and task loading) and some training with underwater repair/welding etc. The small local companies seem to take anyone though, I was reading a case from 2009 where a new bird got lost/drifted off on his first work dive where he was assisting on some vessel repair. 
 

edit: my bad the new bird was a recreational dive instructor, which means fookall in industrial diving.

What professional dive qualifications experience you have? 
 

Air dive, part 1 or? 
 

If you wanna do sat dive, please make out your will first. Money good, but life gone quite fast also, sometimes body cannot be found one. Besides diving cert, if you have other relevant / connected diving skills and certs would be better. Welding / cutting / repair / rescue / salvage / etc.. Courses are expensive, make sure got company willing to take you already then slowly upgrade, don't one shot get all then no company take you coz green + no connections..

This article says he only got AOW, another article says he's rec instructor trained. But hor, if the details are accurate his air consumption quite jialat. Ran out of air, panicked during buddy-breathing ascent and shoot off by himself, then disappeared  
 

http://www.asiaone.com/print/News/Latest%2...901-369006.html
 

But i'm not surprised also lah, I don't have a very good opinion of most of our local recreational divers or dive centres. There's only two places i'd recommend people to learn how to dive with and neither are the "cheap cheap bargain bargain" type.

Got two friends who worked as property agents, even sneaked into private condominiums to distribute flyer, very hardworking chaps, go all out to get sales but in the line for less than 6 months, both quit and told me very difficult....now working as a salaried worker.
 

Some more they are those street smart people able to take long hours and stress....also give up...
 

What do you think?

So many landed properties which have been out in the market for more than one year still unsold

Recently, i can see prices move a tad lower...

Lets see if they get sold.

My take is probably not unless the seller comes to terms with a more realistic price.
