Chinese actress and ex-beauty queen Nina Li is best known for her voluptuous assets and 36-22-36 figure.
 

Although the 48-year-old was previously labeled a 'bimbo' thanks to her heaving chest and presupposed 'lack of intellect', the mother-of-two proved naysayers wrong when she recently pocketed hefty earnings of S$7.13mil when she resold a bungalow purchased more than 20 years ago for S$8.01mil (almost ten times its original price at S$870,000).
 

A common figure in Chinese movies from the 1980s, Nina once said that a female actress should never be reliant on one's looks and figure.
 

After earning a tidy sum from showbiz, Nina subsequently retired in the early 1990s and wholeheartedly devoted herself to her husband and two daughters. The actress is heavily lauded for having a keen eye for property and frequently dabbles in investments and properties.

its really just another story of the rich getting richer.

would she had earned that 7 mil if she didnt have the 8 mil in the 1st place to buy that property?
 

only goes to show that a supposingly bimbo can also make money as long as she has alot of money.

Is that the picture of Jet Li's wife? Wow, amazing body and spotlights. She looks familiar, altho I can't remember her from her old movies.
