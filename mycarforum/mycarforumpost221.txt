Try Amara Sanctuary Resort in Sentosa. They have villas. They're are very stylish and comfortable 2-bedroom bungalows with private pool. Perfect for your purpose.
 

But I'm afraid $2-400 will not do it.

Try asking estate agents on news paper. Sometimes got rich owner already migrate overseas and

leave their empty bunglow in the hands of the agent to sell. Basically, $400 not possible to get someone

to rent a bunglow to you for party. Best bet is to find agent, pay $400 to rent 1 day, than pay him another

$400 to drink coffee. $800 for 1 day, still possible.

The going rate for a bungalow of 3~5K square feet is at least $10K per month and up front payment of at least 2 months. Unless you have something else in return I'm afraid you are looking for dust.

How much deposit you willing to put down? This is not serviced apartment you are looking for, so there is no cleaning up after you. You have to do it yourself. 
 

People who own bangalows are not fools also, so they will not lend or rent unless they can trust you or your money.
 

BTW 500-800 is quite little, an example is an unfurnished 3 storey semi-d in jalan ampang will rent for about $18k monthly. which works out to be about $600/day, this is for at least a 2 year rental contract and a few months deposit.
 

With a single or 2 day/s contract, I think hardly anyone will rent you a bangalow at the rate you are looking for and risk the inconvenience of you trashing the place. Why not look around your close friends if they have something like this to offer, I don't think anyone will risk his property without knowing you personally.

Well, people always rent places under the guise of "family party"  etc... Nobody trusts this anymore, thats why I mentioned check with your friends, at least they can trust you.
 

You remember our Singapore Idol family party? Or more recently the chalet rented by the GF of one of the 4 parang welding fugitives at the famous DTE case?
 

Who is gonna believe it is a family party unless they know you personally? Whats more you are asking for a private place (bangalow) to rent, not a chalet.
 

You cannot compare Malaysia and Singapore landed properties, the occupancy rate is vastly different. The supply and demand is not the same.... Dude, compare apples with apples.
 

You want to rent a bangalow, I don't think anyone who does not know you will do it. Unless the price is right, seriously anything less than $5k/day with a deposit of $50k I don't think anyone who can own a bangalow in his right mind will rent to you.
 

Unless you talking about those outskirt kinda places, very ulu and run down depleted houses which will look and feel worse than your chalets.
 

Anyways good luck, hope you can find your place.

You try buying, renting or selling your house this way. Really waste breath trying to be civilized and explain things to you. Why the f u buy even a hdb so expensive in Singapore? Why they can charge this type of price?
 

You ask really stupid questions. U want to rent, simply explain to u it's not enough and prob nobody will rent to u. Yr 10cents really trying to buy bullock cart.
 

U go rent in JB and impress your family la, make them all travel there to celebrate new year.
 

F it, y not go rent in Philipines? Or Myanmar? Yr F ing $500 can rent for more than 1 month, go for extended holiday from Christmas to CNY.
 

You must be a bloody anally retentive retard. I suggest u go use the $500 and try to buy a brain that's smarter than what u have in yr head. I understand u can buy quite a few pig's brains with $500 even in expensive Singapore, or maybe u wan a go Malaysia or elsewhere where it's cheaper and can buy more.

Why t F do you need to get so agitated... Don't you even use you so called "intellectual' brain to calm yourself down to even post a positive comment... Yes you gave me feedback of what the prices of property and all that land /cost/demand s--t.... and ohh yes even apples... i agree its not cheap here.... 

I'm merely telling you i'm willing to up my offer a bit... if theres a good deal... 

But you keep on telling theres no way to get hold of any freaking bungalow at alll.... I on the other hand have looked around here/sg and in JB to see what i can get.... and that doesn't go down well with you..??? 

Seriously dude... remarks of you telling me to go to other parts of the world dragging my family too is totally uncalled for... do i ask you to pay for my family's outing to deserve all these nonsense...??? Anyways...don offer anything else ... my mind{pigs brain} made up where i wanna go....

Yes you gave me feedback of what the prices of property and all that land /cost/demand s--t.... and ohh yes even apples... i agree its not cheap here.... 

I'm merely telling you i'm willing to up my offer a bit... if theres a good deal... 

But you keep on telling theres no way to get hold of any freaking bungalow at alll.... I on the other hand have looked around here/sg and in JB to see what i can get.... and that doesn't go down well with you..??? 

Seriously dude... remarks of you telling me to go to other parts of the world dragging my family too is totally uncalled for... do i ask you to pay for my family's outing to deserve all these nonsense...??? Anyways...don offer anything else ... my mind{pigs brain} made up where i wanna go....



 

I think you need to be posted to like this...
 

Haziqko -> First post rent bungalow budget - $200-$400/day

Haziqko -> Later posts - increase budgtet $500-$800/day

Unltd -> Ask Haziqko about deposit how much, tells Haziqko  $500-$800 is too low, explains with example of why its low and advises Haziqko to ask around friends who own bungalows because owner afraid Haziqko will trash house.

Haziqko -> It is family party, no intention to trash, managed to get a place in JB

Unltd -> Who the F will believe Haziqko without knowing Haziqko personally? Gives examples of bad family part and also rental under guise, explains why the prices in JB and Singapore different. Gives Haziqko of a reasonable amount to pay and reasonable deposit

Haziqko -> Says it is the same except PRICE DIFFERENT. DUH!

Unltd -> Screws Haziqko, twice, once with a very beautiful ascii art

Haziqko -> Insists he is correct, claims Unltd says not possible to rent (Don't forget I told you your budget is totally screwed, not that it is not possible to rent). Claims Unltd brings family into picture (You said family party. DUH!)

Unltd -> This post I reiterate.

The first link monthly rate is $75k monthly, the next link is Indonesia. GS even ask u to approach radx, who quite clearly finds u a joke.
 

Now I feel bad for u, first thru yr postings n my middle finger to u it could b tat u have poor EQ. But now u have also shown hw thick u r (btw I m nt saying yr waistline, I m talking about yr skull).
 

So now in conclusion, u have poor EQ, IQ and streetsmarts.
 

Now I feel so bad for being so nasty to u  
 

Pls forgive me, I should have know better, be more understanding and did a little charity for u instead of being nasty.

There is a bungalow at the hill top of NTU. If you have friends working at NTU, you can try to get them to rent it for you. Rent is extremely cheap. The period is from Monday to Thursday or Friday to Monday for $40 or $80, can't remember the exact amt. By the way, I stayed there a few years ago, don't know what's the rate now or whether it is still open to staff.
 

However, guests must behave and keep their volume down as a prof lives in the next bungalow.

2 storey + 4 +1rms + porch can fit 4 cars bungalow with pool = RM1500/mth.... 
 

go slap yourself then.... 



 

Siao ... ask for one thing then shift goalpost... *tsk tsk*
 

What you wanted was 




Hey peps... any idea to find or chance to rent a bungalow for 2 days on new years eve...??? Am organizing a mini party for a family of 10-15 people... budget around 200-400 bucks...



 

Yeah, we shouldn't have assumed that location was in Singapore and currency is in SGD. That being the case, here's my suggestion: 

with 200-400 euro, you should get one in India or Pakistan... Sorry, I don't have contact number but since this is a free forum, you should be able to souce for that lah.
 

Better yet, you also didn'y specify what type of bunglow so here's another option, I think with you revised budget, you can actually buy one that comes fully furnished and manned with 10 paper servants. It's even mobile so you can actually bring it to whichever great location you want (beachside, hilltop...) but gotta be careful where you set the BBQ lah

edit: oh, aloha ah, not bungalow but its a very big chalet. shared pool also ok lol. But i really think nowadays dun have those pasir ris bungalows for rent anymore. still remember it was a semi D with private pool and giant garden. had lots of great childhood memories there. sigh... ....

FYI: Streetdirectory.com does not show a valid development called "Biggin Hills Terrace"  
 

And while your post sounds like a very nice peace offering, it's also a very cheap way to save face without having to show any proof.
 

And,  like you, "Not trying to prove you wrong but" I don't really care if it's real or you are only trying to save face. All I register is that you really were quite a "litttle prick at (quite) some point of this thread" when others gave constructive advice to you

normal off peak already $100 per night.
 

new year eve super peak is $107 per night?
 

in fact 30 dec alone is already 250 per night... i'm pretty sure new yr eve much more expensive.
 

in short: you are just b-------tting again to save face.

I suppose. Anyway, little_prince's link validates the development's existance.... However, that does not mean that our 'fren's' claim is valid/real either ...
 

But as I've stated, I don't care. The fact remains that he asked one thing, when people gave reasonable and constructive advice/criticism, he shifted goal post and behaved like a spoilt kid... Haven't read anything like that since Dr M retired and danielgx ( if I rem the nick correctly) chickened out on that meet up dare ...

Anything to for ego mah .... 
 

Quick facts challenge: 
 

Fact1. Normal Peak Period (Friday - Sunday) is $200

Fact2. Eve of public holiday is classified as Super Peak Period. 30Dec, while not a eve of public holiday, is already classified as Super Off Peak at $250

Fact3. New Years Eve falls on a Friday. New Years Day falls on a Saturday
 

Whichever way you look at the FACTS there's no logical explanation to endorse TS's claim of having secured the venue at the price mentioned.... 
 

I remember a post in this forum some time back from a guy boasting about buying a luxury branded watch .... and his proof of ownership was a badly photoshopped image of the watch, with the signature advertisement 10-10 face, on (supposedly) his hand....

First of all... i stumbled on this aloha web site, thought it was another NTUC chalet kind of thing but surprised to see a few choices of colonial style bungalow for rent. Some are better than the one i chose but i liked the looked of the one i booked. Most of it is double storey in Changi though... 
 

sad i didn't get on new years eve/day so i just booked on a week day. Anyways ....

First this:




Hey peps... any idea to find or chance to rent a bungalow for 2 days on new years eve...??? Am organizing a mini party for a family of 10-15 people... budget around 200-400 bucks...



 

shifted to this:




LOL ya... i've adjusted my budget to around 500-800 now... still looking around....



 

Then shifted goal post to this:




anyways not easy to find in singapore but i got a few in JB already... mostly singaporean/overseas owned.The only thing is the trouble of getting everyone there at the same time... but thans though for the info...







2 storey + 4 +1rms + porch can fit 4 cars bungalow with pool = RM1500/mth.... 



 

Finally tried to claim success with this:




Thanks for being nice all the time...  
 

Anyway just would like to say... I GOT THE BUNGALOW ALREADY..... for $107/night!!! (4 bedrooms + toilets with tub and etc...)



 

Only to reveal that:




sad i didn't get on new years eve/day so i just booked on a week day. Anyways ....



 

Like I said ... anything for the ego ....

just go to the website and i'm sure you'll be able to book it ona weekday anytime now even if you just joined as a member. Yes civil servant gets priority and subsidies rate. Weekend rates are 200-250. 
 

What face i wanna save already...  ??? i'm pretty sure most of you had a great time here already rite... 
 

Just wanna share this piece of idea instead of just going to chalets...

Now now... com on kids... lets be democratic for once... 
 

First of all... i stumbled on this aloha web site, thought it was another NTUC chalet kind of thing but surprised to see a few choices of colonial style bungalow for rent. Some are better than the one i chose but i liked the looked of the one i booked. Most of it is double storey in Changi though... 
 

sad i didn't get on new years eve/day so i just booked on a week day. Anyways ....



 

do you even know the meaning of democratic??

but finally landed with:

Haziqko -> I NEED want Bungalow and PTE to show off

Then Haziqko -> I BOOKED Biggin's terrence (terrence and non PTE)

Now Haziqko -> Never confirm he booked, CLAIMS doing everyone a favor by showing where can book for 200-400 when almost EVERYONE knows chalets and these types of PUBLIC bunglows and terrences can be booked and advised Haziqko in the first place.

Now Unltd -> Double Reiterate

ntuc chalets are like pigeon holes... i wanna have that wow effect on ppl... what i'm actually looking for is somebody who owns a bungalow but trying to sell it to actually let me rent it for the 2 days....the kind like at the sentosa cove thing....



 
 

Haha saw this thread little late...previously was marketing for a client his Kasara The Lake 2-storey unit in 2011,  as owner is long term overseas and wanted a refresh idea of renting out his unit not monthly but short term...gave him concept of daily rent with personal butlet/conceierge/valet 24/7 service just like a hotel. Approved the idea but the rental was   $6000+ a day.  , with meals/bbq all taken care of though.
 

Too bad hdd pics were overwritten previously so no available pics to let all to see.
