I think it is disrespectful if you post pics of his house w/o his knowledge. You are at the same time submitting him to unnecessary danger from kidnapers,burglars,etc.... hopefully you have got his permission to post pics of his house.

IMO,I don't see there is any problem at all as I heard never disclosed to anyone here which company I work for or where the hell this house is.If just by posting it will "submitting him to unnecessary danger from kidnapers,burglars,etc.... than billions of house which are posted in the web are already goner liao.

Your boss is the boss of wat ahz?  
 

This year CNY i went to my mum's cousin place. It was a dam big house too. 4 storey with lift, a swimming pool and a fountain, BBQ pits, a sheltered walkway to link the 15 meter high lobby to the bedroom and the kitchen etc. This whole house is occupied by a couple and their 2 kids. Quite shocking, the house cost $11 million and the utility bill costs abt $1.2k per month....

Landed property do not have such term as plot ratio.
 

Only high rise apartments are controlled by plot ratio to govern the built up area.

Usually their grand parents came to new found land in the 1950s and gotten the land cheap.  Just some numbers to chew on, a 15,000 sq ft  house at Chancery Lane in those days is about $20K and domestic maid salary was $20 a month, fried noodles were 10 cents a plate.

Bro while maid salary is $20 I assume employer salary is also $200-$300 being the norm? So buying 20K land is similar to current salaried employee at $3000 buying $3M land which is a far fetch dream?
 

So it still boils down to....how did they get rich in the first place? hehe

You guys ain't seen nothing yet.
 

The ones at sentosa cove are truly the richest of the rich. Just driving pass a few $25mil units and already saw two Roll Royce Phantoms.
 

These houses have yacht docks behind the houses. And the nicest thing is that there are no high walls or fences. All American style open land. Very nice. And the view of course is the best money can buy in SG (still got cargo ships in the distance though). The air is freshest you can get in this country.
 

Cheapest thing at Sentosa Cove are small 1300+sqft condo units that cost around $5million facing the South China Sea. Security speaks better English than many in this forum, haha. A condo this size in Hillview costs 1/5 of that.

Firstly, many were merchants from China. They fled to SE Asia as there were civil in China in late 40s and 50s.  They are quite OK as they come from a more advanced economy. Just like people from New York will say our property cheap.  IN those days, property in Southern China or HK is not cheap. We are just slightly more than fishing village.
 

Bearing in mind, only the rich ones can afford to buy ticket for ship ride while the poor ones are left back home till the communist stop all travels.
 

Second group of people are the high flyers (employees), salary could be $600 to $1K. They have University education which was very rare in those days. Sec 4 is quite solid. Unlike today, Uni grads are flooding the market.

I dont think it inflat till so much lah. My grandma bought a unit in Chancery Lane for 30K during those 1970s era.
 

The neighbour recently sold their unit but definately not 20 or 30mil.
 
 

Now my aunties and uncles having a war because of this unit. Some wana sell, some wana keep. I small boy only, so sit one corner and watch the war.  Cant understand the overgrown adults.  Already half leg step into coffin liao still wana fight.
