how does HDB define between first timer and second applicants ?
 
ok, I bought a resale 3rm when I was single.
 
now I am thinking of upgrading to a new  bto 4 rm as I am now married with a kid.
 
so am I first timer or second timer ?

as long as you never take a grant or buy direct from gdb you should be a 1st timer. If got another gf then its 2 timer....

Thought first timer and second applicants should refer to new flat application? Buying resale flat already counted?

what is the grant ?
 
does it include the subsidized LUP or MUP I paif after I bought my resale flat ?
 
will taking a HDB loan when I bought my resale flat make me a second timer (2T) ?

Yes, take grant also count as one time.
 
if you took grant for resale (1st time), then
apply new BTO (2nd time), that means... full time liao lor. 
 
like normal soccer match, no extra time one hor...
 
after that is either resale (without grants), or private.

I am in the same boat as your bros ...
 
I never take grant but I took HDB loan ... so by right should be 1st timer ?
 
but my ex-colleague told me he only took loan also kenah downgraded to second timer status ... but he still ok ... coz he collecting his new to his new flat in Oct liow ... first try also.
 
all these websites sometimes answer also quite confusing ... that's why gotta ask around for real experience.
 
btw anyone else bought new flat recently ? is it really above 5.5k total household income then no govt grants ?

This second resale is
1) after having only bought one resale?
 
or
 
2) after having bought one resale and one BTO?
 
 
If #1, then 2nd resale with grant is the second time.
 
If #2, then 2nd resale will be full time liao and no more grant.

I believe one person can only get the Grant once only ...
 
priority is given twice though ... but once you get married, can become first timer again !
 
anyway, I did not take the 15k grant when i bought my resale coz I thought it was so miserable ... but good thing I did not use it also ... else now will be headache.
 
but then again, dunno  now still can get or not ...

btw, can anyone tell me how the repayment works for family ?
 
lets say you loan 100k from HDB and put both husband and wife as applicants and both will repay using CPF.
 
then how does HDB deduct from CPF ? 50/50 ? or a stipulated amount ?
 
can deduct from one applicant only ? eg deduct from husband CFP and don't deduct from wife cpf ?
 
is there any difference between declaring the wife as a co-applicant or just an occupier ? (since the husband paying)

no need to be 50/50, can be 100/0 if you can afford to.
 
but still must put her name as co-applicant, no women is so stupid not to have her name in a property

hehehe ... I am commoner ... just tried HDB eligibility app ... said I can still buy BTO !!
 
when I bought my resale 3rm, actually no need to take loan but I thought, 不借白不借 ... so borrow 20k and then pay over 10 years just to make use of my entitlement.
 
but I did not take the grants ... but now, I have decided that this new BTO will be my final resting place ... so want to squeeze everything I can from the govt.
 
and frankly, even if kenah toto jackpot I also won't buy condo ... personally feel its a waste of good money.

So it is the grant that determine how many timer a person is? And a person is only allowed with total 2 grant?
 
Actually it's not exactly the grant. It's the benefits a Singaporean can get from housing, given by ah Gong.
 
Buy new flat from ah gong, the price is much cheaper than the market price for a similar-size flat. So that's benefit.
 
for those who buy resale instead of new flats, ah gong gives discount, in the form a grant. So this is also a benefit.
 
Each person is entitled to 2 benefits.
 
But check whether can buy 2 resale and get a grant on both occasions or not? I bought once only and took the grant, but never bought a second resale...

Err... i think to buy 4-rm and above, will need a nucleus family to apply leh. So unless the husband add parents or children's name, otherwise sure must add wife's name as applicant, else not a nucleus family cannot even apply.

this is a 5 room. the layout of a 4 room is almost exactly the same but living/dining area shrink by that 18-20 sqm (90 vs 110). the rooms are all identical for 4 vs 5 room.
 
I would advise to get a 5 room if u can afford it. The extra space makes a difference.

put occupier also family mah .. ??
 
anyway, reason I am asking this is because of an unfortunate incident of my friend.
 
my friend just got his new resale for a couple of years before he passed away due to heart attack.
 
his wife was a foreigner who bore him two kids.
 
but the "good" thing was that the wife inherited the flat from the husband without having to pay the rest of the loan.
 
so I am thinking what was the thing that let his wife inherit the flat without repaying the loan ?

still can put your wife name as co-applicant, but your take up 100% of the loan. If you have any winte rmelon tofu, your wife can stay for free

it's mortgage insurance lah. pay a premium every year via CPF.
They will pay off the loan in case of death/TPD to either party of the loan. But u can choose how much to insure. up to 100% of amount (or 50% of amount which is stupid and not recommended).
 
It's part of the DPS scheme which u must take when using CPF to buy HDB flat if i recall. Or something like that.

still can put your wife name as co-applicant, but your take up 100% of the loan. If you have any winte rmelon tofu, your wife can stay for free  
so the "loaner" can be a named person other than then applicant(s) ?
 
I mean if put me and my wife ... and anything happens to me ... won't they automatically go after the next applicant ?
 
or I can just borrow the loan all under my name alone ?

it's mortgage insurance lah. pay a premium every year via CPF.
They will pay off the loan in case of death/TPD to either party of the loan. But u can choose how much to insure. up to 100% of amount (or 50% of amount which is stupid and not recommended).
 
It's part of the DPS scheme which u must take when using CPF to buy HDB flat if i recall. Or something like that.

 
Actually might as well get normal term life insurance if it is cheaper.

is this "built into" the repayment ?
 
coz I don't remember this .... only remember fire insurance.
 
lets say if cfp deduct from both me and wife a/c, will they go after my wife when I am gone ?
 
or shud I just deduct from my a/c ... so they cannot go after her ?
Actually might as well get normal term life insurance if it is cheaper.
 
... my chronic illnesses raised my term insurance for $250k coverage to a yearly premium of $4k !! ... so not really cheaper for me.

i think for HDB, it's very cheap. my loan was about 250k for my BTO. I think it's cheaper than insuring 100k SAF term life insurance (i cant rem the exact numbers).

hehehe ... I am commoner ... just tried HDB eligibility app ... said I can still buy BTO !!
 
when I bought my resale 3rm, actually no need to take loan but I thought, ä¸åç½ä¸å ... so borrow 20k and then pay over 10 years just to make use of my entitlement.
 
but I did not take the grants ... but now, I have decided that this new BTO will be my final resting place ... so want to squeeze everything I can from the govt.
 
and frankly, even if kenah toto jackpot I also won't buy condo ... personally feel its a waste of good money.
One treats housing as housing, the other treats housing as premium housing (the “wasteful” part) plus investment with precision controls (the investment part). 
Both types of housing cannot be compared side by side.

put occupier also family mah .. ??
 
anyway, reason I am asking this is because of an unfortunate incident of my friend.
 
my friend just got his new resale for a couple of years before he passed away due to heart attack.
 
his wife was a foreigner who bore him two kids.
 
but the "good" thing was that the wife inherited the flat from the husband without having to pay the rest of the loan.
 
so I am thinking what was the thing that let his wife inherit the flat without repaying the loan ?

 
I'm not v v sure, but i think:
 
must have husb-wife names as joint-applicants to apply for new flats from govt. if not husb-wife, then need to have parent-child instead. That's why singles cannot apply new flats.
 
Then in terms of loan repayment, can be just one person paying - which was the case most of the time in the past when our parents' time, where usually the wife is housewife so no $$ to repay anyway...
 
As explained by the rest, if take HDB loan, got a component built-in, which will allow the surviving spouse to stay free if one spouse passes away, no need to pay the remaining loan.

BTO needs multiple names free from encumberance. 
Resales can buy in one name but must have one more or a set of members who can form a nuclear family.
 
I think only. Best to check with HDB

Hi @ysc3, answer to some of your questions:
 
1) You will be considered a 1st timer since you did not take any grant for your resale unit, so you are free to go for BTO, OR get a resale unit and apply for housing grant;
 
2) You are left with 1 chance to take loan from HDB, since you have already uses 1 for your current resale flat (1 person / family only allowed 2 take 2 loan through HDB, thereafter from bank);
 
3) Per HDB regulations, you and your wife shall be the joint owner of the unit, which is not related to loan. And the each of you will automatically be allocated 50% share of the unit (you cannot change that, even if you are paying 100% for the unit). The same applies if you sublet the unit in the future, after MOP, when calculating income from rental (where income tax is payable);
 
4) For loan, you can do anything from 100%/0% to 0%/100%, BUT subjected to fulfilling the min sum requirement. For example, if you want to use your wife's CPF for downpayment and/or monthly installment, she must set aside at least 50% of the min sum (combination of ordinary & special account) in her CPF account before HDB allow her to use the remaining for DP and/or installment.
 
5) If you are paying your installment using CPF, it is compulsory to get HPS insurance from their appointed insurer, so that in the event when the insurer is dead, become total permanent disabled or suffering from terminal illnesses, the insurance will pay on behalf of the insured the balanced installment amount.
 
But do note that if both you and your wife are paying the installment, each of you have to get your own HPS insurance, and upon the decease of either party, the payout will only for the deceased share of installment. I.e. the other person will still have to continue paying his/her installment, according to the initial percentage.

Hmm can be exempted if you have term insurance covering the outstanding loan based on above FAQ. I didn't know that at that point. but the term and life insurance i had was more to cover for daily expenses, so still needed this to cover for the home loan part.
 

How does it work?

thks for the clear answers ...
 
but still confused with the cpf minimum sum thingy ...
 
when I bought my resale, they took almost everything out ... did not have to set aside any minimum sum.
 
does it mean if buying new bto then must set aside min sum and cannot use all of my cpf ?

is this correct? When i signed for the flat, my wife was still paying loan installment out of CPF. But i think u can state how much of the loan outstanding amount can be stated. Assuming 50-50 split or can be increased to 100% of the outstanding principal.

OK, here is a simple illustration.
 
- You have a flat under your name, said value at $200K, with $10K outstanding loan. So after selling your flat (within 6 month upon getting your new BTO), technically you have $190K, which is >50% of current min sum level of around $160K++. And you can use your CPF for DP and installment.
 
- Your wife have no flat under her name, and say only $50K in CPF (combination of ordinary & special account). So she still do not have 50% of the min sum (which work out to be about $80K+), and thus are not allowed to use her CPF for DP or installment.

HPS is payable on the amount of loan a person take (as defined by the repayment ratio), and maybe changed as and when necessary.
 
Example when person A first get the flat, both A and his wife (B) decided on 50-50 for the installment, so both A and B will each have to purchase HPS insurance to cover for the outstanding loan amount at 50-50 ratio.
 
Then sometime down the road, A decided that he want to pay 100% of the installment, A will have to apply to CPF for the changes in installment plan, and A shall need to pay more for HPS, and the balance HPS (if any) paid by B earlier, will be refunded to her.
 
Now touch wood, if A suffered from total permanent disability (TPD), B will not need to pay a single cent for the remaining loan, as it will be taken care by the HPS insurance. However, if it was B the one that suffered TPD, A will still have to continue with the monthly installment, till all outstanding loan are cleared.

I distinctly remembering paying for 100% coverage each way so that the home loan will be wiped out in event of either of our demise, so as not to burden the survivor with housing loan issues (even though my installment payment was only 60% then).
 
So as below, can be done.

Your share of the HPS cover should at least match the proportion of the monthly housing instalment which is payable with your CPF savings and/or cash. This is because HPS pays off the outstanding housing loan, up to the sum assured, based on the percentage share of cover of the insured in the event of death or permanent incapacity. For example, if you are paying 80% of the monthly housing instalments, and your co-owner pays the remaining 20%, you should be insured for 80% of the loan and your co-owner 20%.
The total share of cover per household should add up to at least 100%.
However, you may each choose to insure for a higher or lower share based on your individual needs and circumstances, up to 100% share of cover per owner. For example, if you and your co-owner are paying 80% and 20% of the loan respectively, you can both be insured for 100%. This means that the Board would settle 100% of the outstanding housing loan up to the insured sum in the event of death or permanent incapacity.

I only bought home mortgage loan insurance for myself so that my wife (stay home mom) will be burden free when and if I am gone.
 
If she is gone, I will still be able to continue paying for the mortgage, so I don't want to spend the extra premium.
 
I rather get her a stand alone accident and death insurance if I really want to but still no such need.
In fact, on top of the home mortgage insurance, I bought yearly 300K accident and death insurance for myself so that the family will have a sum to survive on for at least a year over and on top of clearing the home mortgage.

Hearsay and for sharing and discussion. 
 
If buying BTO/ resale flat between husband & wife, I heard of an interesting way.
 
Taking into account that both husband and wife are financially well to support the BTO/ ReSale HDB individually. 
 
The husband to register as owner, and wife as co-occupier. This way still can buy the HDB under Public Scheme. After MOP of 5 yrs, the wife is eligible to buy a private residential without ABSD.. 
 
As mention, the main concern is that each party must be able to financially support the loan.

I tried to do some googling. I can't see any outright answer that said "No".
Public scheme still need u to fulfill a nucleus family though.
So whether owner vs occupier satisfies HDB criteria, not sure.
 
But i didn't even know you can opt out of joint purchase of a BTO flat. But HDB website does mention you can have tenancy in common.
It’s not common as must couple need both parties to finance the flat. And also the ownership thingy between husband and wife for equal share lo

In a nutshell, it seems possible. I tried the HDB enquiry and one ownership with several occupants is allowed. All names used must be cleared of ownership.
 
If need to use CPF, name as owner is essential. 
 
Combined family income with co-occupiers cannot exceed 12K.
 
Interesting proposition but quite a complex way, for example one will be aiming to buy private in 2023. Nobody knows what prices we will be looking at then.

SRX was estimating 400-480k … but sekali open is 470-550k !!
 
but my current 3 room even nearer to TP East MRT also no good price ...

This bto pricing so ex?! How much can your 3 room in that area fetch ah? Actually not necessary flats near MRT would fetch good price, maybe must see near which MRT line?! Your MRT is DTL, maybe cannot get good price?
