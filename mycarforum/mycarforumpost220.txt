I thought the MOE minister say do away with the ranking??
 



Parents rent condos for better P1 balloting chance 

SINGAPORE - Parents who are desperate to have their children enrolled in the primary school of their choice have allegedly resorted to renting a unit within the 1km radius, The Straits Times reported.
 

Such applicants stand a better chance of getting a place in the school during balloting.
 

The paper said that they had been receiving letters from parents alleging that these parents would move out once their children had gotten a place in the school.
 

The Ministry of Education (MOE) said that children who receive the distance priority should be living in the address of their registration during their primary school education.
 

Cases of pupils who change their address within the six years will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the ministry, a spokesman told the paper.
 

The spokesman added that there have been very few proven cases of parents using false addresses.
 

In such cases, the parents were referred to police for investigations and the child transferred to another school.
 

Some parents are calling for the ministry to enforce stricter checks and clearer rules. They want the authorities to specify how long the family has to stay in a rented apartment and to conduct regular checks.

officially no ranking.
 

unofficially in the hearts of many parents there are already schools ranked higher they are aiming for.
 

if people got money to do such thing, how to enforce against?
 

you cannot expect govt to do things against people that are born in rich family.  just because themselves are not able to compete because they don't have money doesn't mean govt must level the playing field.

Solution is simple - just have parents reconfirm address every year at start of school year.  If address has changed, must change school.  
 

We got IC etc etc to track - shouldn't be so hard. 
 

But to my mind the biggest scam for enrollment is still Alumni, Clan and Church priority.

If within 1km get higher priority in the PV stage as well. 
 

And of course is legal to rent 
 

Some people really twist and turn to get kids in. 
 

To me - if live outside the "zone" should go all the way to back of queue, all those that send their kids far far to Pri school to my way of thinking is a bit  
 

Dun need to be the nearest school, but if must drive there* is too far already.  For me, there is at least 5 primary schools all within an easy walk, if none of them good enough, then just too fussy already
 
 

* unless you really live far far inside private estate

Similarly for Phase 2B...it promotes a certain form of elitist mindset too and not mentioning favouritism...I hv wrote to MOE to challenge them on this and they gave me a standard reply saying that it promotes long term relationship building between parents and schools...I shot back at them asking if Phase 2B parents are guaranteed a placement in the school...they replied no...and I said 40 hrs = long term relationship building? Who are they kidding?   Someone took over from there as the person dealing with me couldnt match up to my questioning technique...
 

There is one school which I raised many many queries. The principal saw where I am coming from and told me that they will stop PV scheme from next year onwards. I guess she knows where I am heading... PV scheme provides a unfair playing field and it does not meet the objective set by MOE and should not be left to the school to administer.

The original purpose of PV scheme was to get parents more involved in their kids' education.  Which is top notch  
 

Then all of a sudden become that you must volunteer before kid is even attending the school, which is  .  How does it increase your involvement if kid is not even attending the school?  
 

A parent should be "involved" with their kids' education and school, regardless of where the kid goes.  How do you encourage this?  
 

Then also, for those really elite schools, that can "pick and choose" volunteers it really becomes an "elite" parents scheme, as only the "best" skilled parents get selected.  My neighbour took leave to do traffic duty to get his son a place - which is purely insane. 
 

On the other hand, another parent I know from the RC is actively involved in reading to students, helping with things like sports day and concerts etc (she's a SAHM) which I really admire and think is great.

Yeah...agree w u man...it is strange but MOE still fail to see this point. some schools I called specifically look for elites such as Child Specialist..and I wonder to myself...so stressful until kids need to see a doctor...   I qualify it as a bad school...

Maybe this is the first registration exercise after the rules were tweaked but if you had followed the registration process this year, the priority for Singapore citizens (SC) over PRs has resulted in increased competition for places in the "good" schools. What used to be slots for PRs are now taken over by citizens hoping for a chance to send their kids into that coveted elite school. Did anything positive change? Not really.... instead, i see a larger number of stressed parents and their equally stressed kids having to undergo balloting just for a place under phase 2C.

And building on this (yeah yeah, expected from me, please don't flame), for those PR that are in the process of getting citizenship, they are really crapped upon by the policy.

you are lucky you even get a personalised reply to your questions.
 

most of the replies i gotten from writing in to stat board, civil service to question their practices and policies are blanket replies that typically states the existing policy is such and they can only administer it accordingly and if they bend it for you it is disadvantageous to others.

And building on this (yeah yeah, expected from me, please don't flame), for those PR that are in the process of getting citizenship, they are really crapped upon by the policy.



 

Speaking of which, i noticed that even some normal neigbourhood schools had to undergo balloting for phase 2C this year. Is there not enough schools to cater to the demand in their immediately vicinity?

Maybe this is the first registration exercise after the rules were tweaked but if you had followed the registration process this year, the priority for Singapore citizens (SC) over PRs has resulted in increased competition for places in the "good" schools. What used to be slots for PRs are now taken over by citizens hoping for a chance to send their kids into that coveted elite school. Did anything positive change? Not really.... instead, i see a larger number of stressed parents and their equally stressed kids having to undergo balloting just for a place under phase 2C.




Still I will say that it is a privilege given to SC. Bottomline, it is a personal decision made by individual...

yes this year there was a record number of schools (80+?) that ballot for 2C. 
 

Would be very very interested in seeing just how this has affected PRs. 
 

NOT saying the policy good or bad, whether it is right or wrong, justified or unfair - would jus tlike to see what has happened in practise, and whether it has made a difference to how and where PR kids can enrol, travel patterns and the like.  
 

Would be interested to, for example, see a compilation of 

a) How far PR kids now have to travel

b) if there are any PR kids that now "have" to attend a school that doesn't offer thier mother tongue*
 

* while I was sitting on the RC, there was one (citizen) Indian parent for whom this was an issue - as the two / three closest primary schools didn't offer Tamil, she had to get help to get her kid enrolled in the next closest.

Putting in too much regulations will actually worsen the situation. Personally, I already find the numerous phases confusing and frustrating. There cannot be a one size fits all policy. It all boils down to the "everything must be best" mentality. Why? Cos our society is not one that gives a second chance.
 

I've seen people suggesting that the family should not be allowed to move house during the entire 6 years of primary school. What crap is this? If such a rule is enforced, then we will only see a distinctive polarisation where the elite schools will always remain attainable by the rich while the average jones can only clamour for the neighbourhood schools.

This phenomenon might be due to the recent changes in rule to give SC priorities. Let's see how it pans out over the next few years. I've a 3 yo boy now and would have to go thru all this crap 3 yrs later.

you are lucky you even get a personalised reply to your questions.
 

most of the replies i gotten from writing in to stat board, civil service to question their practices and policies are blanket replies that typically states the existing policy is such and they can only administer it accordingly and if they bend it for you it is disadvantageous to others.




It voice down to how you write to them... I wrote to them not jus 1 email to secure a reply...I am a pretty persistent guy looking at their standard replies to sieve out a debatable pt.
 

I will challenge and proposed what could be considered and how their policy contradicts the overall nation objective and what can be done to better improve the situation....
 

Someone in MOE (pretty high post) even has the cheek to tell me it is a privilege for Singaporeans to have diversity within the school.

Well it is really how u want to strategise urself to compete for a school. There is always more than 1 single way to get to what you want. If you choose to compete in those elite schools u will hv to face the stress. One thing good is, u face competition w ur own fellow ppl... It is a fair fight and u gotto plan way ahead.

agree.....this is just primary school matters and to expect govt to spend so much resources to administer it, then what about housing matter?

i think you got a better reply also because you are dealing with people in the education sector so they are tryign to show people they can be reasoned with.
 

of course, credit must also be given to your persistence.  i probably can't be bothered to write more if i see their reply indicates a lack of empathy or understanding of the situation.

maybe more fair if every kid let the computer to choose a school for them? then each child has one chance to re-draw if there is another child also wish to do so, but all information are hidden? like playing poker

It's about persistency more likely...I wrote to HDB too on their policy...was pretty well-known to them for a period of time... avg 2-3 emails a month for a period of 8 mths bah....
 

I know what you mean by lacking empathy or understanding of the situation. I think they understand but must be thinking why should I do so much when it is always a top-down approach..everyone is waiting for someone up there to say something. I prefer a bottom-up approach by influencing those up there to change the mindset and then they change the rules of the game. It takes time though...

Yeah, u have a point. Been strategising since last year. Formulated 2 back up plans as well. Just that on hindsight, it's pretty ridiculous that a primary school registration requires so much effort, time and money.

Diversity is a GOOD thing. 
 

OF course, it sounds like this person was being very high handed and trying to say that it's a privilige to have foreigners there, which I wouldn't agree with. 
 

One of the things that worries me about where my kid is studying is that there is too much "sameness" in the students, which I don't think is a good thing - people from all different backgrounds and walks of life is good for a kid's upbringing and "world view". 
 

I would also posit, that not enough diversity when young promotes racism.

The people up there in white will always say schools are a good place to mix and have diversity. Not entirely true. The real melting pot is NS. That's when you have people (okay, only males lah) of different social classes, qualifications, values, races etc coming together.

All things started with a good intent but somehow mismanaged by the ppl executing them... if diversity is a good thing then we should have a flat structure (no need so many phases) and assign school placement based on computer random pick within a few criteria such as distance, racial quota like HDB etc; shift teachers and principals once every 6 yrs. 
 

In this way, we eliminate the branded school structure as school is a school.  Good teachers and principals should be reassigned to other schools to help them improve on their quality of teaching. The fact is, we do know which are the not so good schools and as parents will refrain from putting our kids there if we can afford. Which parent dun want to provide the best to their children so that they can make it in life?

Ya I also agree diversity is a good thing. But to say it is a privilege to have diversity is somewhat not so correct. 
 

Privilege means special right .. and to say singaporeans have special rights to have diversity within school, than what about foreigners?? What about PR ?? Diversity is about different races, different religion , different nationality come together and not just purely Singaporeans enjoy the special right for diversity only.

Unfortunately communication skills of govt employees all too often leaves a lot to be desired. 
 

I do very openly admit, the lack of diversity is one thing that worries me with my daughter's current school. 
 

As to the idea of having a computer assign based on nearness etc etc - there would be good and bad in this. 
 

The bad, would be in denying parents the option to "chase" specific things for their kids education.  (eg: specific CCA or traits within a school - I like that my kid goes to a clan school, but at the same time, I almost choose another nearby school that has a better range of CCA and a more liberal CCA policy)

Actually, even in NS, there is the scholar NS batch where there's hardly any mingling until your rank and set (SISPEC and OCS). By then, with the rank differential, there may be limited mingling within different social classes.
