Hi All,
 

Just curious...for those that have upgraded from HDB to condo, what went into the decision making process beside the perceived or real incentive/comfort that comes with staying in a condo?
 

1.  Is staying near to family a big part of the decision?  i.e. you bought a condo near your parents' or sibblings' place?  
 

2.  Is school a big factor?  You bought a condo that is near top notched primary school for instance.
 

3.  Is locality/convenience a big factor?  You bought a condo near major expressway, supermarkets, neighbourhood shopping hub etc.
 

4.  Is distance to workplace a contributing factor?  Or proximity to Orchard/CBD a key factor?
 

5.  Or is it also due to the fact that you like the neighbourhood estate that you grew up at, and you wanna get a condo in the same estate.
 

Besides the above, what are your main considerations when choosing and deciding on the condo that you purchased?

Though I havent upgrade to condo, my decision will always be based on budget and location. The rest are secondary.

for condos, the advantage is you don't have unwanted or unexpected visitors or peddlars visitign your household.  there's a lot of peddlars and salesman of products and services knocking on your hdb door.  for condo, you are safe from such disturbances.  this may seem like small issue but the damage could be irritation or even to the extent of getting conned especially if you have an old folk at home that is easily swayed by those conmen pretending to be HDB appointed contractors to do this rectification in your household.
 

environment wise, condo is still cleaner and the neighbours are on average slightly more cultured.

For me, it's only one factor.  HDB only allows single to buy HDB flats when one reach 35. 
 

Im not 35 yet.....how to buy HDB? So need to buy condo lo.

That's just a general perception.
 

I can assure you that Face is probably the last consideration for most people who stays in a condo.
 

Most move to a condo because of better living environment and more peaceful for the family.
 

Some, like me, don't have a choice because HDB refuse to sell to me who hasn't reach 35. 
 

Face, was never part of the story.

- Cleaner   - no point if ur condo is next to a HDB 

- Safer       - pp still puncture ur tyres and lock ur gates

- Quieter    - the swimming pool can be full of kids on a lazy sunday when u wan to relax

- More beautiful  - SOme blocks in punggol actually looks nicer than most condos

- Facilities  - do u use the tennis court and bbq pits often?

- More cultured neighbours  - Are u sure?

- No need to fight for carpark - I live in a hdb, and my carpark is basement type and no need fight for space too. Plus, each parking space is generously huge.
 
 

U forget to mention - living in condo had the problem of if ur condo is enblocked and u dun wan to move. Or ur condo is enblocked and they compensate u miserably.

Actually depends what type of condo are you talking about and which district. That makes a very big difference to the answer. Eg a condo right smack in the middle of an old HDB estate (eg Merah Prime in Tiong Bahru) will be different from those mass mkt ones, those in landed areas (eg East Coast) and those in upmarket areas (eg Orchard, Nassim, Upper Bt Timah). Each condo category appeals to different mkt segments with different wallet size and appetite.

Actually what's the point of buying EC (executive condo).
 

Size-wise: New condos are SOOOOOOOOO small. What's the point of buying a more expensive home than your HDB and yet it is so much smaller?

Facilities-wise: These are the facilities typically seen in ECs...

1. BBQ pit - Can go East cost park or book chalet for these pits.

2. tennis court - if you dun play tennis then what's the point?

3. swimming pool - Not enough swimming complexes izzit? Should join a country club membership if you want a not-many-people pool instead. Much more class.

4. steam room - Kills sperm. And country clubs should have much better steam rooms bah. Got jacuzzi if you want too. Or can go for spa treatments. Better.

5. gym - Alot of places have gym already, in case you don't know.

6. garden - Even HDB nowadays have such good landscaping... what's the point?

7. Near MRT, bus interchange, shopping malls - Like machiam HDB flats very far from these places like that.

8. playground - this one no need explain bah.
 

IMO people who bought ECs are those who want to create a high class facade for themselves but have not enough money to buy a upmarket condo or even a terrace house. They are for those who are stuck in-between. Just like porsche wannabes who have not enough $$ to buy a 911, so they short-change themselves to get a Gayman instead. Besides, ECs are right in those HDB housing estates. Hence if you buy an EC, you are still living in the heartlands. No difference from HDB, just that you have wasted some $$ tts all.

Personal experience, mass mkt condo dwellers no difference from HDB dwellers...some mass mkt condo dwellers even worse..they operate on the assumption that they are now "condo dweller"...so are more spoilt....

Facilities-wise: These are the facilities typically seen in ECs...

1. BBQ pit - Can go East cost park or book chalet for these pits <-- it's more convenient to have a BBQ pit downstairs..rather than lugging every single BBQ item to whatever park/chalet. Forget something, just go up and take..
 

2. tennis court - if you dun play tennis then what's the point? <-- the tennis court at my condo is always fully utilised..so, quite alot of condo dwellers played tennis..
 

3. swimming pool - Not enough swimming complexes izzit? Should join a country club membership if you want a not-many-people pool instead. Much more class. <-- country club membership are not cheap to come by either..and some may think, if i am going to spend so and so amount of money, might as well buy a condo, use it as an investment and can use the facilities somemore..and again, it's the problem with distance.. also why travel so far to go and have a swim when it's more convenient to just go downstairs to have a swim. My swimming pool gets cleaned up weekly, and with lesser people using, i am sure it's cleaner than public pool
 

4. steam room - Kills sperm. And country clubs should have much better steam rooms bah. Got jacuzzi if you want too. Or can go for spa treatments. Better. <-- most condo have jacuzzi too..and the killing sperm argument..seems like you're just trying to find some argument for the same of arguing..
 

5. gym - Alot of places have gym already, in case you don't know. <-- you need to pay, either membership or pay-per-use
 

6. garden - Even HDB nowadays have such good landscaping... what's the point? <-- only the newer ones have..also, since HDB gardens are open to public, chances of public nuisance like "bengs/lians hanging around at parks smoking" is higher too
 

7. Near MRT, bus interchange, shopping malls - Like machiam HDB flats very far from these places like that. <--very much depends on location

8. playground - this one no need explain bah. <--same for both HDB and Condo..
 

yes, condo dwellers pay month maintenance for all the facilities..which also include parking(and when we wash car, we don't need to put in 20cents/use cashcard for limited amount of water)..so do HDB dwellers pay for season parking and conservancy charges..
 

i guess it boils down to privacy, peace and quiet ba..you don't get ah long harrasing you when your neighbours owe money, you don't get door-to-door salesman selling whatever nonsense to you..chances of cars being vandalised is lower..

just that overall the impression builds up looking at the estate and community as a whole.  admittedly it may not be a fair comparison because the difference in % of singaporeans living in HDB & Condo is quite disparate to make a meaningful satistical comparison.  and even between different hdb estates, the difference is also there.  so averaging is not always a very fair way to compare.

The last piece of jigsaw puzzle to complete the 5Cs. At the beginning of the year, I was actively searching for a condo. However, I came to realize that I will lose the other C (cash) if I get myself a condo.

same here....
 

if i have to pay 600K for a 120sqm HDB where the nearby condo is going for 800K for a 70sqm unit, i would rather go for the condo coz of the below reasons
 

1) i don need such a big place. By getting a big unit, it means more housework for me and i don't trust maid. So i rather live in a small unit
 

2) more privacy. At least i don't see those small lians/bengs smoking at my corridor
 

3) security. Feel safer for my family with a guard looking after the enterance.
 

4) Damage to car. Don't know if its bcoz of the look of my car, my car got "disturbed" by the pple living around my area and got scratched dunnoe how many times. Really sick of these.

true true. But all those are just my opinions.
 

No point settling for sth that straddles between the "poor" and the rich. Want high class? Just go all the way.



 

So true. No point settling. 
 

So you have a car?
 

If so, what is it?
 

Just curious.. The 911? Or LP460? Continental Bentley?
 

Going by your unique brand of "logic", either take bus, mrt, walk, or cycle. 
 

If not then it has to be one of the above. 
 

Maybe too cheap even...
 

Only the Bugatti will do for you..

i downgraded from condo to hdb few years back as i wanted to reduce my liabilities and fully pay off my property by 40 instead of 55 or even 60.
 

what do i miss the most?
 

i miss the basement carpark

i miss the flexibility of taking a dip or de-stressing at the jacuzzi after a hard day work

i miss the peace - no void deck activities such as funeral, wedding
 

every now and then, the thought of moving back to a condo will still strikes me. but the idea of a bigger portion of my monthly instalment will be made towards interest than principal simply puts me off.

if you are someone who enjoys inviting friends or relatives over, it's also nice to stay in a condo cos they don't need to guess how many coupons they need to put.
 

there were occasions where my friends came over for mahjong, lose money and still kena fine, i actually feel quite bad towards them.

No probs. 

Pass your exams, get a job, get a license, then get a car.

I think you will find that, the real world is about compromises, not ideals. 

5 years down the road, I think you'll be eating your own words. 
 

My 2 cents

Cheeers and good luck for your exams.

Just my 2 cents worth , I used to stay in a hdb with my family before i moved out to buy a condo a few years back. During the 2002~2003 sars period , condos were selling at very reasonable prices as compared to present prices and i join in the wagon to buy an 2 bedroom condo at balestier in which i stayed alone for sometime. Have stayed for some time before moving out and rent out. I must say good rental yields allowed me to roll and bought 2 more 3 year back. Now i'm contented staying in a hdb with my parents as i find no difference between a condo and a hdb.
 

My experience for the difference between a condo and a hdb is that Condo dwellers then to think they are an upper class and some are practically snobs. Maybe it was just my neighbors. I have seen plenty of complain kings and queens during my 1/1/2 year stay there before i move back with my parents due to their poor health. I will try to define my perspective of the pros and cons and it is subjective so please don't flame me.
 

Pros of staying in a condo - 
 

Quiet environment - abit of noise even before 11pm , your friendly neighbors will start to call the security to tell u to quiet down 
 

Free carpark - limited to one allocated space , meaning if your neighbors find out you don't drive they can park another car in your space and refuse to move out when you have visitors stating that you don't drive anyway.
 

Free amenities - like gym , swimming pool , tennis court etc , meaning that your maid gets to enjoy them during weekdays while you are working your arse off during the daytime and when you come back , the whole place is packed by kiasu residents trying to get their money's worth of the amenities.
 

Security - having a security post ensuring that nothing happens but sometimes when they are sleeping or when they go for a patrol or something caught up elsewhere you get left outside the gate for half an hour
 

Cons of staying in a condo 
 

Civilized neighbors - Having "friendly" neighbors trying to know what you are doing everyday and trying to invade your privacy by comparing against everything you do. Sometimes you will find self pawning neighbors which gives you good entertainment at times.
 

High maintainance fees - monthly protection fees given to ensure your safety and that your trash gets out of your way everyday
 

No nearby kopitiam or market near by - Hungry? Anything you need , you either drive or walk very far for your quick bite. Even pizza takes more than 20 mins to reach you due to security. 
 
 

Pros of HDB -
 

If staying with your parents - don't need to employ anyone to upkeep your house save as least a few hundred bucks , good food and someone irons your clothes everyday completed by the daily nags with never cease to change.
 

Free seating for your car - Free for all , all fair game , if you are early you get good spots , no joker invading your allocated space and telling you that they are free to take your space be it for whatever reasons.
 

Easy access to markets , kopitiams  - food is easily accessible but also mean sometimes you need to stay quite late if your friends intend to visit you and tcss. 
 

Cons of HDB dwellers  - 
 

Noise levels can be high - majong sessions can go up to 2~3am at times and there is no point calling the police ,even if the police come , they would stop for a while and continue at an even later time.
 

Pay and pay - want to go gym? Pay!  Want to play badminton? Pay!  Want to park car? Pay! Want to swim ? Pay!
 
 

No security ensuring your safety - sometimes you can lose a pair of shoes or snickers and stuff if you leave them outside. Had a neighbor consistently losing her bra and panties. Just install a few cameras and problem solved.
 

p.s my 2 cents worth , don't flame me for it , hopeful it is more convincing that a kid's perspective.

庸人自扰， I don't find such problem. Living in a condo is for better environment. All those things about neighbours being hao lian basically is about how you see people. If you don't 狗眼看人低 in the first place, why did you have such childish mentality. Might be inferior complex, but why if you can afford a condo in the first place.

Given your statement , you are contradicting yourself.
 

Why would you think i should have inferior complex when i can afford a condo? Problem is i don't but by you saying that it would indirectly mean that you are thinking you are high and mighty.
 

Do you really think being able to afford a condo means you are rich ? and others staying in a condo would be having inferior complex?Condo nia act like it is some high class property that no one else can afford if you stay big big landed maybe but not a condo .  I wonder who is the one with the mentality 狗眼看人低 in the first place. Hao lian ? You just shown us an example. 
 

What better environment ? Still breathing the same area , not like you breath some fresh air like those in Aussie ? Problem is i grew up in a hdb environment maybe i'm not used to it.

Hi All,
 

Just curious...for those that have upgraded from HDB to condo, what went into the decision making process beside the perceived or real incentive/comfort that comes with staying in a condo?
 

1.  Is staying near to family a big part of the decision?  i.e. you bought a condo near your parents' or sibblings' place?  
 

2.  Is school a big factor?  You bought a condo that is near top notched primary school for instance.
 

3.  Is locality/convenience a big factor?  You bought a condo near major expressway, supermarkets, neighbourhood shopping hub etc.
 

4.  Is distance to workplace a contributing factor?  Or proximity to Orchard/CBD a key factor?
 

5.  Or is it also due to the fact that you like the neighbourhood estate that you grew up at, and you wanna get a condo in the same estate.
 

Besides the above, what are your main considerations when choosing and deciding on the condo that you purchased?   



 

I'll answer your question to the point.
 

The entire gist of shifting out from the pigeon holes, to a private residential ( be it condom or landed or strata or cluster) for good, is that the living environment affects you and your entire family's well being.
 

That said, there are of course, some who do live in private residential but are not making the best of their living environment and do fall way short of living well.
 

But it should be the first step, one should take to improve the chances of having a 'better life'
 

Cheers

Well, I told you it is for better living environment. 
 

I remember once when my wife saw a flasher when taking lift back home at 8+pm at night when I was still staying in a HDB flat. 8+pm, imagine that. It is really scary to think of that, maybe you are not married yet since you can stay with your parents. I don't mean it is completely safe when living in a private homes, but imagine having to walk her home everyday she comes home late.

Actually what's the point of buying EC (executive condo).
 

Size-wise: New condos are SOOOOOOOOO small. What's the point of buying a more expensive home than your HDB and yet it is so much smaller?

Facilities-wise: These are the facilities typically seen in ECs...

1. BBQ pit - Can go East cost park or book chalet for these pits.

2. tennis court - if you dun play tennis then what's the point?

3. swimming pool - Not enough swimming complexes izzit? Should join a country club membership if you want a not-many-people pool instead. Much more class.

4. steam room - Kills sperm. And country clubs should have much better steam rooms bah. Got jacuzzi if you want too. Or can go for spa treatments. Better.

5. gym - Alot of places have gym already, in case you don't know.

6. garden - Even HDB nowadays have such good landscaping... what's the point?

7. Near MRT, bus interchange, shopping malls - Like machiam HDB flats very far from these places like that.

8. playground - this one no need explain bah.

IMO people who bought ECs are those who want to create a high class facade for themselves but have not enough money to buy a upmarket condo or even a terrace house. They are for those who are stuck in-between. Just like porsche wannabes who have not enough $$ to buy a 911, so they short-change themselves to get a Gayman instead. Besides, ECs are right in those HDB housing estates. Hence if you buy an EC, you are still living in the heartlands. No difference from HDB, just that you have wasted some $$ tts all.



 

Your post show how childish and sour grape you are...
 

New condo are never small... new flats are. There are always 3-4 brdrooms condo for you to choose... if still small can opt for penthouse... it is how deep your pocket...
 

Drive Cayman is shortchange meh??? What car you drive???
 

Drive Cayman anytime can drive GTR... so ppl drive GTR are power?? Because it is the most expensive Nissan?? Then all 318, 320,323,325 and 335 owner are stupid?? Because there is a M3???
 

Different ppl have different needs... One man food another man poison.
 

Just don't sound sour.... those in red... are all facilities in condo whereby you car just take a life down and enjoy... no need to drive out.
 

So if you put it that way... do u have a bed at home? No need bed ma... Hotel got bed and is better.

do u have rice cooker at home? No need ma.... hawker or coffeeshop no sell rice ah?

do u have washing machine??? no need ma...can send to laundry...

do u have tv at home? no need ma coffeeshop and cc have free tv... maybe bigger than yours

do u have fridge for cold water? no need ma.. mama shop or ntuc also sell cold drinks.

do u have computer at home? no need ma.. internet cafe got computer..
 

use your brain before you shoot and don't behave like a loser whining when ppl buy EC and you stay in HDB flat trying to justify how good is your HDB flat.
 

You call ppl who stand by their Honda FIt a FIT nazi.... u are behaving like a HDB Nazi here 
 

Last but not least.... ask yourself do u have $$$ to afford an EC and drive a Cayman??

There will always be sour grapes, but my take is if you don't use facilities much, some HDBs are pretty good living too.
 

Personally, I choose private property because of the FH status and that to me is something no HDB can give.

My sis is one of those... a better environment for the Kids.
 

Condo will beat HDB in general... no doubt about... if can afford then why not???
 

The feeling of going back home or going out is totally different.
 

At least you won't get to see O$P$ on the lift wall early in the morning.

The problem about these ppl nit picking on the more well to do folks is common in this forum and in many others.
 

Instead of taking concrete steps to improve their lives they go about complaining, nit picking and simply being jealous about others.
 

This shows why over 80% of these folks do not change much in their overall living structure, way of life, characteristics or to have a will to make a difference in their lives.
 

Which is just as well, as to why the Elites keep stamping onto them and ignoring them whenever their complain about anything under the sky.
 

It is a well known fact, that what one make out of one's life is entirley in one's hand. But to these folks, they can't see past thru the gaps between their fingers.

If can afford Freehold of course go for freehold la.... but if cannot afford freehold but want a better environment and slightly higher living standard then can look for EC...
 

Can't stand sour grape looking down on EC when he is obviously staying in HDB flat.
 

I want to ask him what school he study in... what car he drive... 
 

If cannot get into special school then don't study lor...

If cannot afford Bugatti then don't drive lor...
 

In that case he shouldn't stay in HDB flats... cos HDB flats are not the lowest standard... he should stay in Squatters since cannot afford Nassim Banglow.
 

These are his theory.... haha Young and Sour... talk from the NOSE... Talk is always cheap. Typing behind a computer is even cheaper.

I think your experince is due to the fact that your development is small?

I live in a large leasehold condo near to the ECP, with several other developments ringing it. 

Let me just run down your list. 
 

Snobs: I really don't think snobs are confined to condo/HDB dwellers. 

I guess i just don't interact with my neighbours so much cos i am not hm most of the time. Complaints, i find is good, to have someone keep the management on their toes. Cos i sure as hell am not going to do it!
 

Quiet environment: I don't find the area noisy. Even with the occasional mahjong, no probs for me too. I think its considerate to not make loud noises after 10pm though. I avoid doing it myself. 
 

Carpark: Never a problem for me. Plenty to go around. 
 

Amenities: I don't have a maid, just part time maid that comes twice a week. Like my privacy. I don't understand why you would call people kiasu just because they are using the gym after work? Thats the common lifestyle, don't you think. My condo has 6 running machines, and frankly if I'm working out, i rather some people be there. If not quite creepy...BUT i don't really work out, to the chagrin of my wife.  Perhap the occasional swim.. 
 

Security: I never had any problems with not being able to get in, cos the swing gate is automated to open if you have the car pass card. Even smaller condos(with only 1 security)  that i went to also got automated gates. 
 

High maintenance fees: High or not is subjective i think? Also because of the larger condo, could be lower than yours. I also appreciate the frequent fogging of area and rubbish chutes. 
 

Kopitiam: Again perhaps not very applicable for my case. There is a convenience store and food stalls in the compound. I can always walk to the nearby condos if i want to get other food. In fact, they deliver i think. 

But buying groceries yes a bit far, about a 10 mins drive the nearby Bedok Central. Cheap somemore. Got Sheng Siong Got NTUC. So i find ok. 
 

Living with parents: i can't see why living with parents is a pro of HDB. They can also live with you in condo what. 
 

Car "seating": Like i said, no problems for me..
 

Easy access to markets: Yes got slight advantage, but from where i used to live with my parents in the north, also need to drive to get groceries, so i guess different experience lor...
 

Pay and pay: Well i find for HDB is "pay as you use" while for condos its more like a package. I think all got to pay. This is Singapore. Its just the style of payment
 

Just my 2 cents, but i find your comments a bit more balanced that that kid's. Cheers

If can afford Freehold of course go for freehold la.... but if cannot afford freehold but want a better environment and slightly higher living standard then can look for EC...
 

Can't stand sour grape looking down on EC when he is obviously staying in HDB flat.
 

I want to ask him what school he study in... what car he drive... 
 

If cannot get into special school then don't study lor...

If cannot afford Bugatti then don't drive lor...
 

In that case he shouldn't stay in HDB flats... cos HDB flats are not the lowest standard... he should stay in Squatters since cannot afford Nassim Banglow.
 

These are his theory.... haha Young and Sour... talk from the NOSE... Talk is always cheap. Typing behind a computer is even cheaper.



 

Wah you even more fierce than me...

Well, I told you it is for better living environment. 
 

I remember once when my wife saw a flasher when taking lift back home at 8+pm at night when I was still staying in a HDB flat. 8+pm, imagine that. It is really scary to think of that, maybe you are not married yet since you can stay with your parents. I don't mean it is completely safe when living in a private homes, but imagine having to walk her home everyday she comes home late.



 

Yes maybe i'm single that's why i don't understand. Neither do i understand why i can afford to stay in a condo and probably a car and yet still need my wife to walk back. Won't it be better if i fetch her? At least i bother to fetch my gf back from her work everyday. Maybe i'm too free.

I think your experince is due to the fact that your development is small?

I live in a large leasehold condo near to the ECP, with several other developments ringing it. 

Let me just run down your list. 
 

Snobs: I really don't think snobs are confined to condo/HDB dwellers. 

I guess i just don't interact with my neighbours so much cos i am not hm most of the time. Complaints, i find is good, to have someone keep the management on their toes. Cos i sure as hell am not going to do it!
 

Quiet environment: I don't find the area noisy. Even with the occasional mahjong, no probs for me too. I think its considerate to not make loud noises after 10pm though. I avoid doing it myself. 
 

Carpark: Never a problem for me. Plenty to go around. 
 

Amenities: I don't have a maid, just part time maid that comes twice a week. Like my privacy. I don't understand why you would call people kiasu just because they are using the gym after work? Thats the common lifestyle, don't you think. My condo has 6 running machines, and frankly if I'm working out, i rather some people be there. If not quite creepy...BUT i don't really work out, to the chagrin of my wife.  Perhap the occasional swim.. 
 

Security: I never had any problems with not being able to get in, cos the swing gate is automated to open if you have the car pass card. Even smaller condos(with only 1 security)  that i went to also got automated gates. 
 

High maintenance fees: High or not is subjective i think? Also because of the larger condo, could be lower than yours. I also appreciate the frequent fogging of area and rubbish chutes.

Fair comment   , maybe mine was much smaller as compared to yours so the stuff might be different , i did offer to ask them to come over to stay with me after i got another bigger apartment but they said very troublesome to travel around and they will miss their friends . Another reason is their poor health and their place is near to the polyclinic.

Let me clarify for you.
 

You are probably too young and with a mindset like that...won't make it out of the woodwork.
 

There are some steps ppl make to improve their lives.  Whether he can afford a car and not fetch his wife is irrelevent about his affordbility or means to actually make a concrete step towards actual improvement in his life.
 

You definitely have not learnt much after reading thru the various posts.
 

Many have said, they must have deliberate planning and careful ways towards making an improvement in one's life...and moving to pte residential is the first step or at least the most important step.
 

You will probably will not even take the first baby step towards any big improvement  becos you simply criticise and nit pick on irrelevant issues instead of seeing the real and bigger picture.

Ya maybe i can't , at least i know what i have and what i can afford. Won't make it out of the woodwork? Well it is subjective , i do not know how do you define success but i think i can afford not to work and still live comfortably. I'm a person with very low maintenance as I'm single but even if i have a family i think i have enough for them. Yes , i'm young and might sound arrogant to some but at least i'm not a hypocrite , say this do another. By the way , cherry picking on my comments are common in this forum dude what kind crap you talking about big picture go check out the replies some jokers have on my comments?
 

My reasons for those comments is that some people i know think that Staying in a condo means improving their life yet further burdening themselves and letting their loved ones be subjected to unnecessary risk as they need to work alot harder for their money? Isn't it better for money to work for you ? Work less hard , lead a simpler life and have more time for your loved ones?
 

Better living environment? By the way i grew in my estate where almost everyone knows another and the estate I'm in is pretty "safe" as everyone keeps a lookout for other. Sorta of kampung spirit in which you would never find in any condos.

dude, you have your points.

and they are good ones.
 

just that sometimes in a forum or anywhere for that matter,  situations cannot be compared apple to apple.  so what happens is that you will get opposing replies.  i get them all the time.
 

as long as we 're not at each other's throats using vulgarities etc.... healthy debates so as to understand different perspective is good.
 

i've been a spectator reading through your posts and some replies to them.  

both make sense from their specific angle.
 

dont get too worked up.

same goes to the rest.
 
 

long weekend coming

Don't worry , I'm cool , i like positive engagements, as long as we agree to disagree. I just don't like the way they try to pin others down and when i react to them , they act as if they did nothing and try to be saints. Typical hypocrites . 
 

Army taught me one thing which i think is very important in the way i lead my life, when there is a problem , try your best to solve it , not avoid it and give plenty of excuses and pin others down just because i can't do it.
 

Enjoy your long weekend too ! Cheers !!

Aiyo....paiseh how this thread has escalated to....
 

Reason why I am gathering viewpoint is because I am now holding 2 jobs...my normal day job and as a property agent....
 

Anyway...my personal take on all this...
 

I bought a condo beginning of this year...so far the value has been rising....last I checked it's almost 100k higher now...so to me it's good investment (I can always sell it and move back to my parents...not that I am thinking of doing that)....
 

My reasons for buying my condo is pretty simple:
 

1.  I don't qualify for new HDB and HDB loans

2.  Wanna stay near my parents

3.  Good primary school nearby

4.  condo amenities - decent size pool....dont fancy condo with really small pool...

5.  5 minutes walk to a shopping mall with huge NTUC

6.  5-10 minutes drive to CTE/TPE

i wanted to buy HDB and take grant last time also cannot.

bloody income ceiling so low. fU*ck HDB, denied me of my rights as a tax paying citizen of the country.
 

they should provide for everyone eligible regardless of income ceiling a right to buy one new HDB.

No probs. 

Pass your exams, get a job, get a license, then get a car.

I think you will find that, the real world is about compromises, not ideals. 

5 years down the road, I think you'll be eating your own words. 
 

My 2 cents

Cheeers and good luck for your exams.




true. Schoolkid have schkid mentality. Personally I find HDB quite alright. eg. I dun face late-night mahjongs, and the tenants which I've complained have all moved out.
 

So no need for upgrade yet. And my place is pretty convenient. And I have not started working yet, neither do I have kids and a wife, so I've left all these considerations out when writing my replies, which are just my personal opinions which are not worth flaming about. (after all its schoolkid's mentality right?)
 

I do respect that different people have different needs. Perhaps once I started working and have a different set of needs and responsibilities my opinions will change. Who knows?
 

My 2 cents.

Yup Throttle...certainly not 'fair' as I was definitely NOT CASH RICH back then (not now too hehe)...i think for my example, household monthly income is not necessarily a good yardstick of my financial situation.  I am sure there are many folks with combined household income below the ceiling but sitting on a mountain of savings in the bank.....oh well...
 

With the high resale HDB prices with amazing COV back then..we decided to pay a bit more for a condo instead.

You can't buy a HDB flat direct from HDB  if you currently own a private property...
 

Buying Of New Flats By Private Property Owners
 

As a private property owner, you cannot buy a flat direct from HDB. If you dispose of your private property, you have to wait 30 months before you are eligible to buy a flat direct from HDB.

when u buy HDB flat u still paying to govt be it installment or lump sum, subsidy well.....if someone wanna sell his Bata Shoes to u at exorbitant price of Pedro shoes and give u 20% discount, u r still overpaying, nmind those arguments about cost price and market rates...

I can show you many private properties where grocery, food, etc can be bought without driving out and also very near MRT. No need to put up with HDB. I guess it all boils down to whether you can afford pte property.

At all times, since you joined this forum, you can buy/sell resale HDBs lah!
 

No restriction to size of resale flats you can buy in the open market.
 

Only is that you got to stay in it for 2.5 yrs before able to rent out or to resell.
 

But in reality, they heck care whether you actually stay in it or not during the 2.5yrs.

You can't buy a HDB flat direct from HDB  if you currently own a private property...
 

Buying Of New Flats By Private Property Owners
 

As a private property owner, you cannot buy a flat direct from HDB. If you dispose of your private property, you have to wait 30 months before you are eligible to buy a flat direct from HDB.



 

damn....

There are pros and cons in buying a HDB for investment purposes.
 

The rental yield is much better and the amount you need to pay as maintanence fee are lower and almost the same for many years.
 

Which translate to better rental yield.
 

The are also more tenants to will be found for it.
 

Once, you have pass the time frame for restriction, the HDB investment is like a goose that lay golden eggs, why kill it?
 

Unless, you are hungry for goose meat? 
 

By and large, the cons of the HDB for investment purposes are lesser ( no enbloc except SERS) but you have to know which locations to buy, lift level and the dist of the unit to the fairy God mother train station.
 

But of course, if you can afford a sea fronting condo, do quickly put down your deposit for it!

No ifs.  
 

I can well afford a sea fronting condo (or even two) but i dont believe in rushing to buy at such bubbling levels.  
 

I buy when i'm convinced regardless of price, but i'm not convinced
 

i'm also not a seaview person, i am a nature park person.

theres a reason why people pay for a condo. no need to think others are stupid. you might have your reasons for staying in a hdb, but hey, the fact that condos exist, and priced at a premium, speaks for itself. 
 

personally i like
 

1. the lift is not shared by 10000x people

2. you get out of the lift you see your car, no need to walk 5 minutes to the multistorey carpark. 

3. dont have loan sharks

4. the place looks/smells nicer and is generally more pleasant
 

i bought hdb resale when i got married. it wasnt cheap, but i got married very young and that was all i could afford. frankly, the 30k govt grant is free money. dont take from the govt is your loss...... 
 

oh and, HDB dont sell 4000 sqft penthouse. dont say penthouse, i cant even find a nice 2000sqft 4 bedder from HDB.

At current level, you better buy or else will go higher one!
 

Actually you late liao!...most smart ones have already brought their condos and for landed they are already building and having their own swimming pool, ready soon by this year end! 
 

So you see...you can't get the really true news via forums or thru good  frds ( which frds are those that want you to make money and not for themselves!  )
 

By the time, ppl tell you this and that in forums...the news is already stale.

1. Is staying near to family a big part of the decision? i.e. you bought a condo near your parents' or sibblings' place?
 

To be honest not exactly, you gotta buy the place because you WANT to, not because of others.
 

2. Is school a big factor? You bought a condo that is near top notched primary school for instance.
 

Yes school is an important factor, but not a must. It affects your childs future and to me that is most important.
 

3. Is locality/convenience a big factor? You bought a condo near major expressway, supermarkets, neighbourhood shopping hub etc.
 

Convenience is good. But other factors such as ERP is another thing. Just make sure those area no ERP can already.
 

4. Is distance to workplace a contributing factor? Or proximity to Orchard/CBD a key factor?
 

Distance to WORKPLACE is the MOST important instead of near to cbd. Thats what I would chosoe to be more important, workplace.
 

5. Or is it also due to the fact that you like the neighbourhood estate that you grew up at, and you wanna get a condo in the same estate.
 

I am very surprised of this question, because to me this would be one of my considerations. I would say yes to this one.

got other benefits lah, baby bonus et al. but this housing grant is really the top prize. 
 

the ultimate prize are the jokers who bought direct, kenna a top floor east coast unit and made at least half a million. all because they got a lucky ballot number from the HDB. why these people are entitled to profiteer is beyond me.....

Yeah, I believe you are too free. Anyway I don't drive then.
 




Yes maybe i'm single that's why i don't understand. Neither do i understand why i can afford to stay in a condo and probably a car and yet still need my wife to walk back. Won't it be better if i fetch her? At least i bother to fetch my gf back from her work everyday. Maybe i'm too free.
