From what I know if you own a HDB now, you cant buy a foreign property unless you sell your HDB within 6 month of your foreign acquisition. Likewise if you are a foreigner you cant buy HDB unless u undertake to sell your foreign property within 6 months.
 

Penang is good but expensive, i think single storey terrace around 500k-700k++. If you plan to take loan end up paying 1 million ringgit+. If you want can consider Kedah, my sister bought a semi-D around 200k. Went up a bit since then. When bored can go Thailand which is nearby or Penang which is 2 hrs away.

Not so direct. HDN owner must meet MOP 1st before can buy private property.

Penang less than 1 day driving distance, should be alright. Don't drive QQ to Pahang (traffic jams behind you)

The flip-flop policy changes in the past still fresh in mind. Malaysia properties... think again. Retirement not for regretting. Investment not for charity.

You may get in touch with an online real estate agent as he may make you aware of all the investment options available with you regarding the buying and selling of property. A real estate agent will also help you in the dealing and even help you in carrying out the legal proceedings.

Before the blind leads the blind any further, allow me to state what is correct.
 

1. If you own a HDB, you are free to buy private residential as long as you have fulfilled your MOP. (You do not need to sell off your HDB after MOP to buy private)

2. if you own a HDB and yet to fulfill MOP, you cannot buy any private legally.

3. For private home owners, if you buy a HDB; you have 6 months to sell off your private after your HDB purchase.

Higher return mean higher risk too.  You can look at Sutera Mall , Nusa Bestari .... should be around 1.8M liao ! for sutera ... last year 1M

My take is very simple. If you got that extra money and are looking for investment, Penang or any country also can. Of course got to consider why invest in Penang.
 
As for retirement, I cannot understand the concept of buying. The only thing I can think of is, you hope that when you finally live through your retirement and wish to pass on the property to your next generation, this will be a sound investment.
 
Don't lock up your cash for retirement. Do invest if you got extra but where and what is important.

I read in somewhere that if you want to invest in Malaysia, best to invest in land scarcity area like KL and Penang.

If you are looking to sell,  who is going to buy from you? Your money is locked up.

either rent out or stay for retirement ?
 
I think even in land scare Singapore, the rental take up rate is not that fantastic at 2 - 3 % per annual
