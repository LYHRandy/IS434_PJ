Young Malaysian women are apparently not money-minded and materialistic. When it comes to finding a life partner, many female participants at a recent youth forum said they would rather have someone with five 'As' (Affection, Appreciation, Ambition, Acceptance and Attitude) instead of the so-called five 'Bs' (Billions, Bungalow, Benz, Brain and Body).
 

In the long run, I'm sure they would eat their words.
 

What I can infer is that, these women wouldn't mind having an ambitious partner who maybe isn't stable job-wise and monetarily-wise but appreciates them?
 

Surely, they can't be completely not money-minded? Of course, I won't expect my partner to be a billionaire residing in a bungalow driving a Benz, but he must have a stable income at the least?
 

If not, how can I enjoy a random food feast, being the foodie that I am!?
 

In my opinion, it's relatively easy to find someone to give you affection and to appreciate you as you are, especially in the case whereby the female is the sole breadwinner and the guy isn't exactly "brainy" enough to get a high-paying job. Because he's relying on you, and he may have a good heart but where's the stability? To me, it's expected of the guy to accept you as you are and have the characteristics you're looking for in a partner, so that shouldn't be a fixed criteria for a partner. It's almost the same as making the statement "I'm looking to find a guy who isn't abusive." Anyone in their right mind wouldn't want someone like that!
 

I guess in Singapore, it's hard not to be money-minded, especially with regards to the future. I, for one, would mind if my partner gets a lower salary than I do, because of the generalized stereotype that the man is supposed to be the one who "looks after the house." I wouldn't want to be in the compromising position whereby I have to pay for almost everything. And I'd like to think that people do use their materialistic products to show off how well they are doing, which explains why branded goods are more favoured. But that doesn't make it a necessity, most of us can do without these items anyway.

It's always funny to see how guys stereotype women. It also show how much some guys know about women.

See, the difference here is that after everything failed, our neighbour can still go back farming, plenty of land to go around, can still survive.

Here, even if you dare to beg, you will up lorry very fast.

Flashback to 6-7 years ago, when Andy Xie was still star chief Asia-Pacific economist of Morgan Stanley.
 

http://www.japanfocus.org/-Andy-Xie/2073
 

"Gaming, as in many other places, is viewed as an easy source of economic activity."
 

"the expatriate population – a major force in the high-rent market – has declined as foreign businesses send more of their employees directly to Chinese cities." 

-> expats arriving and almost out of control in 2009, 2010
 

"The bottom line is, will Hong Kong and Singapore be able to justify wages that are 10 or 20 times those of their immediate neighbors in the era of globalization? If not, steady deflationary pressure will constrain wage growth, which suggests poor earnings growth for the companies operating in these economies. "

-> very key question that key decision makers need to think over if the high GDP growth rate is really that sustainable
