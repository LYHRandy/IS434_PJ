any of the people here joined in the queue? Actually, i would like know the reason for such a phenomenom. $350k to $750k (3 to 5rm flat)
 
With a cap of combine income $8k per month, is it really enough to pay for a HDB flat that cost that much? I can easily get a condo at that kind of price.
 
Anyone know what's the reason for this phenomenom?

Based on the previous DBSS offering in Tampines, quite a lot of ppl jus trying their luck to "tikam tikam". Quite a few will drop out even if their queue number is the first 700+.

Thats definite. Frankly $8K income ceiling quite often breached. Family members chipped in, Wife resign then re-enter workforce, self employed thus income declaration a little murky etc........ Maybe that's why till now HDB still stubbornly refuse to revise it. Supply and demand issue, quite a lot of ppl prefer to stay near city, no need to drive, near to workplace in CBD etc......
 
     For the price they are paying, yes can get a condo, but most prob will be in the suburban area, not new, no preferential interest rates......To each his own, jus hoped these ppl know what they are getting into

Ask any real estate investors what is the most important quality they look out for in their investments, most will tell you -> Location.
 
As for the 8K income cap, it does not matter when young couple's parents support come into the picture

Many young couples do not know the 120% max loan from CPF.
 
When this clause kick-in when their payment reach 120%, then many would die!

Garment got hidden agenda.
 
1. If one is tie down by such loan, how could one retire early?
   It would fall nicely into working till 70~80 yrs old.
 
2. Many young couples buy condo.
   They also like to have a bite of the pie too!

Dun need to worry for them lar, i'm sure pple who buy propertes @ such prices would not jump in with their eyes cosed. Most of them who bought it would have some sort of other financial support. Parents, family members, old flat sold @ big profit etc etc....

actually two fresh out of school lawyers (4.5k each) already breach the 8k limit. so would two IB or private banking fresh recruits i think. 2 teachers would also be very near the limit. and these jobs see good steady increment. 
 
so 2 young professionals in the right field work for a few years will be able to afford the mortgage v. comfortably. and time is on their side.

Not sure if the 3K flat income cap applies to the 3-room flats under the DBSS scheme. Coz from what i've understood, DBSS scheme have a cap of 8K, regardless of flat size.

let says someone bought a 5rm unit for $750K, after 5 years how much can he sell? $1 million?
 
Actually hdb flats were being transacted at such price levels pre-Asian Crisis days.
 
I rem when I was shopping for a flat a few years back, there was a very nice mansionette unit asking for $15K above valuation. But in those days, hardly anyone is asking to sell at valuation (esp big flats) let alone asking to sell above valuation! 
 
That fella simply refused to budge and when so I asked him why? So he told me that when he bought this flat, he paid close to S$700k for it so although the valuation is not as high as that, he still insist on transacting above valuation to lessen his pain.  
 
So the moral of the story is that the economy is cyclical and when there is a downturn, prices will tumble so it doesn't mean you pay S$750k now, you will be able to sell above S$750k in the future.

simply said: maximum u can use 120% of property price to pay using CPF
if flat is 300k then u can use 360k to pay from cpf..
 
this includes interest. so anything more than 20yrs, high chances need to use CASH!!
