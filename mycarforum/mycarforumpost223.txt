I am staying in a Condo on the west of Singapore and my home is fast becoming a little Philippines ....
 

So many units are rented to foreigners, I feel that I am like the minority. Spoke to the security and they were complaining about the foreigners .... and they still prefer the locals. I heard stories of them throwing empty beer bottles into the pool, pang sai on the urinals etc etc. Very very poor social behaviour.
 

It seems better to stay in a HDB now ...... at least the rental is regulated/controlled. Thinking real hard about moving out ... and I am just wondering what it the situation with the other condos. Any feedback ?

The reason for my post is to find out the situation with the other condos...... like i said it seems better to stay in a HDB now as the rental is controlled/regulated unlike private property. My friend staying in Bukit Timah told me that there are also a lot of Indians in his estate.

Currently, the only place where you can be surrounded by at least 95% true blue Singaporeans are
 

1) Army camps

2) SCDF/SPF

3) Opp party rallies during election time

Did you take a first step to let them know that you didn't like some of their behavior ? As a second step, are you part of the management committee that set the estate rules and by-laws ? If not, do you consider being a committee member so you can do a part to improve your estate environment ?
 

Posting here won't help, talking to security who takes a salary from the management committee also doesn't really help unless you instructing them as employer to take some actions.

do you actually know the numbers??
 
 

in the last year our population increased by only 100k, of which 30,000 was citizen births
 

so only around 70,000 FTs came into singapore last year.
 
 
 

compare that to the fact we created 150,000 new jobs last year......if we hadnt brought in 70,000 FTs who would have done the work?

A 3 bedder condo rental is typically 4K/mth, it is not easy to find family tenant so usually it will end up rented to a group of foreigners(5-8) ppl. Divide the cost out, it is cheaper or equal to renting a HDB room. Besides, they get to enjoy all the facilities of the condo. 
 

From hearing your story, i really think staying in HDB is better now.

The diff in HDB is there is no common facilities which you need to share with those FT....maybe only carpark and lift bah. So in the sense you don't have to tolerate their behaviour. What really matters is your next door, upstair and downstair neighbours. If they are local or family staying, you are safe. No party animals.

So, blame it on the singaporeans (who form the bulk of mass market condo buyers), renting their condos out to non singaporeans...
 

Hope that you learn that it is not the physical building of a condo that makes good living but the people who live in it.

Frankly the situation is not going to change.

the only way is to procreate yourselves to ensure you future stake in your home land.

So don't complain house space too small or money no enough.

just put the most priority to procreation.

I am staying in a Condo on the west of Singapore and my home is fast becoming a little Philippines ....
 

So many units are rented to foreigners, I feel that I am like the minority. Spoke to the security and they were complaining about the foreigners .... and they still prefer the locals. I heard stories of them throwing empty beer bottles into the pool, pang sai on the urinals etc etc. Very very poor social behaviour.
 

It seems better to stay in a HDB now ...... at least the rental is regulated/controlled. Thinking real hard about moving out ... and I am just wondering what it the situation with the other condos. Any feedback ?

The former president's decision was announced on national television by lawyer Raul Lambino two days after the government stopped her from boarding a flight to Singapore.
 

Ms Arroyo, 64, complained she could not sleep and her blood pressure was unstable while being treated at a Manila hospital she checked into late on Tuesday after her failed travel attempt, Mr Lambino said on GMA television.
 

'She told me, 'I don't think I can manage to travel,' said Mr Lambino, who said he had visited her at the hospital late on Wednesday.

The diff in HDB is there is no common facilities which you need to share with those FT....maybe only carpark and lift bah. So in the sense you don't have to tolerate their behaviour. What really matters is your next door, upstair and downstair neighbours. If they are local or family staying, you are safe. No party animals.



 

yesterday when I am trying to take lift up with my family, I realized that the lift is stuck with the Ind FT. They are trying to squeeze their bicycle into the lift for too long until the life get jam. Because of this the other lift didnt come down when I press the bottom because this lift hold by the FT is already parking at ground floor
 

Luckily someone took the other lift from upper floor down. So finally, my family and I can take the other lift. But guess what? The FT quickly come out from the jam lift and move to the other lift waiting infront of us thinking that they come here 1st. With their bicycle infront of us, there is no way that we can take the other lift. 
 

So end up we take the initial lift which is hold up by them as it turn out to be working!

Economy slowing down recently, so need to import more FT to increase GDP.
 


 



Singapore PM: Economy Is Visibly Slowing Down 


 
 
 
 

Singapore's economy is visibly slowing down and will continue to do so into the first half of 2012, as global economic conditions get tough, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Wednesday.
 

"We are now in a period where incomes will be under pressure at the low-end. I think even in the middle, white-collar workers will also be coming under pressure," Lee told CNBC.
 

On a quarter-on-quarter annualized basis, Singapore's economy grew 1.3 percent over July-September, after contracting 6.3 percent in the previous quarter, according Ministry of Trade and Industry.
 

Annual growth is expected to slow to around 5 percent in 2011, after a record 14.5 percent rise in 2010, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said late October.
 

"There will be uncertainties because the (economic) cycles are shorter, things go up, things go down," PM Lee said.
 

For the economy to continue to grow at a strong pace, Lee said Singapore needs "more workers, more skills, more talent."
 

Foreigners account for nearly one-third of the country's 5.18 million population, according to the Department of Statistics' latest data.
 

"The more you tighten the inflow, the slower growth is going to be and that's something Singaporeans will have to understand," he added.

do you actually know the numbers??
 
 

in the last year our population increased by only 100k, of which 30,000 was citizen births
 

so only around 70,000 FTs came into singapore last year.
 
 
 

compare that to the fact we created 150,000 new jobs last year......if we hadnt brought in 70,000 FTs who would have done the work?

Are you staying in Floravale at Jurong West near to Gek Poh Shopping Center? Well I used to have a friend who stay there, yes I agreed there are a lot of foreigners staying there. Yes I agreed with you on their behaviour and habits on those living there but there are some who are very  smart & innovative. There is a family living there that we can learn from on "Saving $$$$$"

1) They (whole family including maid) take their daily bath and others at the swimming pool toilet.

2) The maid will push the trolley with buckets of water from the toilet and up the lift back home to do laundry and also wash the car.

Good idea right/ see we Singaporeans must learn from them, don't always complain.

No need to check, because Badder is confirmed wrong.   
 
 

When Badder quoted 30K citizen births in his 100K increase, it already demonstrated Badder does not even appreciate simple concepts such as: 
 
 

Citizen increase = (citizen births (Badder quoted 30K) - citizen deaths) + net migration of citizens (new citizens immigrants minus old citizen emigrants) 
 

Population increase (Badder quoted 100K) = citizen increase + PR increase + non resident increase.

does any one particular citizenship has 100% good people

the answer is NO

As I said in my first post.

Blame it on singaporeans.

We brought it to ourselves.

Dont point fingers at others.

Of course national policies and direction has an impact but it's still singaporeans ourselves who are responsioble for our own situation.
 

If Singaporeans are more down to earth like before all this wont happen.

singaporeans all want to stay condo, so they abandon their HDB at the first chance they get.

FW of course rush to "takeover" the HDB.   
 

Next singaporeans who cant really afford second property, still want to borrow big big and buy second property.  so they have to rent it out.

mass market condo rent to who?  rent to low end Expat lah, of course! 
 

So now, our HDBs dont belong to us and our condos also dont belong to us, want to blame who?

thank you fellow Singaporeans.
 

Next please.....

It's been like that for years. Maybe yield might increase since there's always a demand for rental units there by the FTs. Give them a homely feel amongst their own race ma. I can imagine tandoori chicken, prata, naan, curry offered by them everyday ! Drool man

you talk like they have brought millions in.
 

do you actually know the numbers??
 
 

in the last year our population increased by only 100k, of which 30,000 was citizen births
 

so only around 70,000 FTs came into singapore last year.
 
 
 

compare that to the fact we created 150,000 new jobs last year......if we hadnt brought in 70,000 FTs who would have done the work?



 
 

the 150,000 jobs belong to which level ?blue collar or white collar
 
 

the problem here is Singaporeans are not pro-creating
 
 

1) why are singaporeans not pro-creating ?
 

2) is importing FT a real solution or is it running away from the problem ?
 

3) who stands to benefit socially and FINANCIALLY from the mass import  (to me its open-leg policy rather than open-arm policy)

I am staying in a Condo on the west of Singapore and my home is fast becoming a little Philippines ....
 

So many units are rented to foreigners, I feel that I am like the minority. Spoke to the security and they were complaining about the foreigners .... and they still prefer the locals. I heard stories of them throwing empty beer bottles into the pool, pang sai on the urinals etc etc. Very very poor social behaviour.
 

It seems better to stay in a HDB now ...... at least the rental is regulated/controlled. Thinking real hard about moving out ... and I am just wondering what it the situation with the other condos. Any feedback ?



 

Your question kind of silly.
 

It depends on the area right. If your Condo is in Orchard, or CBD area then obviously you will have more of the "atas" type of FTs who are better behaved.
 

If your Condo is in places like  Chao Kang, Yew Tee, where the rental is far lower, obviously it will attract FTs of all kinds.
 

My opinion is that FTs/FWs are part of Singapore now. Why can't you learn to accept to live with them?

First of all, I am realistic and I can never afford to buy a condo in Orchard, CBD, Sentosa Cove, Keppel Bay  etc etc. The FTs there are atas but I am not 100 % sure that they are better behaved. Have you encountered "rich", "atas" FTs before ????? Try to talk to SIA stewards and stewardness and ask them who are the worst and most diffcult passenger that they have encountered.
 

My question is not silly as I am trying to confirm the situation with the other condos in Singapore and that include the end ones at Orchard, middle end at Bukit Timah, Mass market one in CCK and YT. 
 

You are silly to say that I am not learning to accept and live with them ..... as a matter of fact, I have not moved and I am learning to accept having to live with FTs/FWs. and I agree that FTs/FWs are part of Singapore now.

I think you are confuse between being demanding and bad behaviour. If you want to talk about planes, my experience with those first class and business class FT passengers are that they can be demanding, but they are not badly behaved. 
 

I stay in a condo in the Central area...quite a few FTs here who are executives and higher management guys......they have never exhibit bad or rowdy behaviour. But I can see that they are demanding during annual meetings. But nothing wrong with that. 
 

When I was at a condo in Bukit Batok (the highest one there.....you probably know which one. It has 600 over units....mass development type), I can see many FTs and FWs too......they were making lot of noises at the pool area. To me, that's inevitable.....first it is a mass development, and secondly, its rental is affordable.
 

So the answer to your question is actually quite obvious. More "atas" condo will have less rowdy behaviour FTs. More affordable and mass development condos will have more rowdy behaviour from FTs/FWs.

Fair enough, I agree with your comment that the more "atas" condo has less rowdy behaviour. But I disagee that all Atas FTs will not have bad and unreasonable behaviour ... and I can definitely deferentiate between being demanding and bad bahaviour ....
 

Well, I guess I have to work harder and make more $$$$ to afford a condo in a ATAS area .... to get away from my "little philippines"....

I have to agree with this statement of yours. Singaporeans no doubt are mostly very kind people, but it also make us very undemanding and give in to every kind of bad services and bad attitude pushed to us. Think about how many times you have to live with rude security guards, rude hawkers, rude service staff in restaurants, ticketing, shopping malls ? And how many times we just quietly accept it ? 
 

On the contrary, most of these so-called FW or FT are not used to accepting sh*t. They make sure they get what they pay  and not much difference whether atas or not atas (another Singaporean or perhaps colonial stereotype).
 

I've personally witnessed both angmoh and Chinese (HK, TW or PRC) and South Asians or Arab and Latin Americans (which many Singaporeans treat as angmoh anyway because they can't tell the difference) demand for proper service quality in both polite or impolite ways.
 

Now, whether one prefer to live with demanding customers, or live with poor and incompetent service attitude, it's up to individual. But one thing for sure, if someone treat you like crap and you quietly accept it, they will continue to do so.
 

In this thread, the TS already said he will not tell his neighbours off for their perceived bad behavior, because he is "afraid of risks". Honestly, I am Singaporean but I do not understand what is this "risk" that people are so afraid of. They can eat you ? Seriously, don't talk too much and do something about improving your own lives.

OK OK, I kia-see, no balls to tell the FTs/FWs off in my condo and I staying in misery. But it is my choice isn't it. Does it bother anyone if I choose not to confront them ???
 

It is a fact that we are getting more FTs/FWs and there is not much that we can do .... I get getting postings here that the situation is not much better in HDBs. Instead of telling the citizens to accept them, what about having some control and ensure that we get the "atas" one and not those that speak loud and have bad social behaviour.

Here is where it is quite contradicting. You said that we should not be telling citizens to accept them, which I agree totally. Then you say it's you choice to accept it quietly, and not let them know you didn't like the way they behave. Maybe wait for something or someone.. maybe MP ?
 

I don't know what is this thing about "atas" or not "atas". Does it mean if they behave in way acceptable to you, it is "atas" and if not it is not "atas" ? So what if other people are in better or worse situation, does it make your situation any better ? Or you want others to feel just as miserable as you feel ? What controls are we talking about ? You want ICA officer to live with the FT for 2 weeks and see if they like them ? 
 

It's your choice so be it. If you have a good advice to share, it might help others too. Replace "FT" with "Singaporean" and see if it still make any sense.

I some how interact with filipinos pretty often. 
 

The ones staying in the ground level units were mostly health care workers. Can see the laundry they hang to dry. Nice little panties n bras too. They are pretty loud n make a hell lot of noise at home esp when there are like 10-12 of them living in a three bedroom apartment.
 

The ones staying at higher level are KTV gals. They start work ard 8pm. Dress till damn sexy with tons of perfumes. These are pretty quiet lot. Mostly kept to themselves n dont make much noise. Probably made enough noise at their client's place while being banged. 
 

Then the ones that work onboard ships. Extremely frenly bunch. Address me as Sir here n Sir there.  Somemore they are of higher appointment than me. They once in a while come to SG as a transit point.  But their work can be very sloppy n bo-chup. 
 

Nothing against them but depends on the type of filipinos u interact with I guess.

To update on the thread that I have started ...... last year.
 

The good news is I am going out of my condo ...... and the bad news is that the "Pinoys" situation is getting worse. My estimate of the local against FTs is 60% local and 40% FT. The condo is getting old and a lot of people are buying their second property and renting out their old one. More and more Pinoys are moving in. My CO even commented that she don't feel comfortable swimming in the pool nowadays ... 
 

Out of the 8 units in my level, 3 units have changed hand (including mine), 2 units are rented out (1 to a Pinoy family but they are good neighbours and one rented out like a hostel - to Ang MO, chinese etc). 
 

This is the situation now and looks like we have to learn to live with these FTs .... they are here for the long haul .....

Maybe condo should restrict the number of head count in the rental unit.

How can one 2 bedroom unit put in 10 people?
 

End up FW stay condo and enjoy facility, local stay HDB




a valid suggestion.  the security should ask for residents card and a 3-bedder unit should only be issued 4 resident card.
 

and owner must be informed in advance this practice so they will not dare to rent out to so many persons in one unit.

and if any of your neighbours try to profit from the system by renting out to FT, u st away report

No matter where you move (unless GCB), all places in this tiny dot have been invaded by FTs/FWs.




Even GCBs also got many FTs renting ... the high networth ones.

Usually ang mohs and a few north indianians.

But no chinanese, pinoys, myanmarese, south indianians, or the likes.

Chinanese FWs can have 10 pax sharing a condo unit with 2 bathrooms hor.

Many will go down to pool toilets to shower and sh!t.

They can also all sleep on the floor - no need beds.

Resident cards are mainly use to book/use the facilities ...... MCST can control the no. of cards allocated but they cannot control the no. of people staying in the unit. 
 

My immediate neighbour rented out his unit like a hostel ..... individual room and there was one unit that even partition the living room as an additonal room for rental.
 

Agree with the comment that housing in Singapore are FT free for the first 5 years and after that all hell break lose .....

My HDB floor has Indians, Filipinos, Chinese, Myanmar, Australian, Sri Lankan. Each occupying 1 unit. Only the 2 ends of the block which are 4-room is Singaporean.
 

It is ridiculous to me being the minority.



 

same here.. my floor got 4 units. up till recently, 2 indians and 1 vietnamese FT family. 

we are 25%.. minority
 

but frankly thanks to these FT, the hdb owners are earning good rental income. eventually 1 of the indian FT family move out and the owner came back to stay... did a full reno, house nice nice. now owner occupied. the rental money must have paid for the reno.
 

so, shld we thank the FTs?

Hmmmmm, no really. I bot my new place from a China FT ..... they bot the unit brand new from the developer and I bot "sub sale" from them. They made a cool "250k" selling the unit to me after less then 3 years .... I am not complaining as I believe in "willing buyer-willing seller" ..... but do they thank us (Local) for the $$$ made ..... I don't think so.....
 

Many FTs would just sell the property when it is time for them to go home and bring their earning ($$$$$) back to their countries.

i know the purpose of the card.  but what i am saying is that without policing and enforcement, any condo owner would want to maximise return renting out to maximum number of tenants.  the only people who are appropriate to do the policing would be the security guard and they must insist on residents card when they see people coming in, or using the facilities.
 

an even better suggestion would be the resident card should contain photo.

MCST cannot control what that is happening in the unit ..... those tenants without resident cards would just say that they are visitors .... do you expect the guards to go the units and check whether the "visitors" are staying overnight ???? 
 

Seriously condo are worse off compared to HDB as HDB has their own rules .... but for condos the situation is worse ...
 

For HBD upgraders ... it would be frustrating as they have anticipated a better living enviroment upgrading to private property ..... but it is not the case nowadays ... there are more anti social behaviour with the FTs/FWs.

My new place would be good for another 5 years ...... when the place is still new ...... before the FTs/FWs start to move in.
 

Based on my experience with my current condo, Owners would stay when the property is new and start to move out after 5 years ....

well, i know what you meant.  it can only take place with deterrance as aim.
 

it is not wrong for the guard to ask any person on the compound to show their residents card and if they claimed they are visitor, then for the guard to take down particulars of the unit they are visiting.  much like police have a right to ask any person in singapore to show them their passprot or nric.  but seriously if after being checked two or three times, you think the tenant won't complain to landlord?  and landlord will then be forced to appropriately refund some of the tenants the rent.

Had two property in 2007. Now got 5.

Regular rental yield, low interest rates, capital appreciation.
 

Retired already and vacation overseas most of the time.

He credits the property boom to FTs and now goes and enjoys in their lands with their money that he earns in Singapore.
