Just wondering , with the property going up north , at what combined income do you think an average Singapore can afford a Pte property > $1.2m comfortably ? 
 

EC > $1m for combined income of 12k is it too pushy / risky ?

I not stupid lah my benchmark is 20k and I still find it risky

$20k too risky loh. You need at least $30-$40k. Most people stay condo will also take high loan for cars. Don't end up becoming a slave to your assets.

That's why I said it is risky too. The best is have a Property to collect rental for another property 

Still workin hard for the 1st property but the 8 character one stroke also

Don't have :( that's why I find those pple with income only 10k very gutsy

In theory, if no kids and no obligation, then a combined salary of $12,000 will be able to afford a $1.2million condo.

$1million loan monthly about $5k installment.
 

The issue in Singapore is not about affordability.....it's the upside of the properties increase in value.

A $1.2million property will worth $2million in five years time.

So the issue of affordability is moot as one can sell it off easily for a huge profit.

Combine income 12k than slave for thirty years.

children how, sure got this type of income for.the.next.thirty years,?
 

Keep it simple and realistic.HDB als can look very nice with some good reno.
 

Just my two cents worth.

Just play the game while you are young and not obligation. If lucky properties appreciate by 60% within 5 years, can sell off, and buy HDB, then start a family comfortably!!
 

If don't play the property game.....wait until old and high income....it may be too late as many will not dare to take as much risk for fear of bankruptcy.
 

Better to Start young, bankrupt at least will not affect family or kids.

Because many Singaporeans see property as an sure win investment hence, pushing beyond their means to get it.

I have a friend. 

his income about 6-7k a month. his wife sometimes work, but after a while will quit, then work again, then quit again. very unstable working pattern.

has 3 kids and he needs to feed his mum.
 

made money on his HDB about 300k. die die wanna stay in condo. stretch until dunno like what go and buy EC in punggol. I advised him against it but it's his money. 

I thought he has cash buffer from the sale proceeds of his HDB; end up he needed the money to pay off his unsecured loans and STILL WENT TO BUY A CAR. now modify the car like mad and spend even more money.
 

I really hope they can pull thru.

good question but there is no answer whether it's too pushy/risky/ok

real life experience ... ah beng friend combine income $15K, bought a $3M (2 storeys)  + 1 car (conti) + 2 kids + maid

i don't dare ask how he survive and how did he get loan and how much loan

i assume his parent sold their flat and live with him ... but that's only give him $500K-$600K headstart

I think these people (most likely 1st owner) sold their HDB flat and keep the profit as cash.. Since they would have accumulated more CPF over the last 10-20 years, and if they cannot downgrade, they will go for Condo?

This is called PROGRESS, and it is what our govt likes to see.
 

Because it supports their claim that Singapore and Singaporeans are getting richer, not poorer.
 

Because it supports their claim that their ever-increasing GDP is good for Singapore and has indeed trickled down to Singaporeans.  Most Singaporeans, anyway.  Definitely not to that half-blind Ah Ma newspaper seller with the little boy.  People like that should be put in concentration camps and gassed because they are a blight on the success of our society.

No loan, no kid, no car loan n sell away existing HDB now at higher value, with that cash in hand now can easily get a 800k EC.

But must have a sum of money on hand as backup for rainy days to service the loan.

But if wanna upgrade when one is 50yrs old is more risky as CPF reduces in %.

I think one can also enjoy life while living in a condo and driving a B&B car.

Used to do that in my late-20's.

Fun weekends, before the kids arrived - go here, go there; look for furniture, antique hunting, audiophile hi-fi demonstrations, condo launches, horticulture gardens, wine & cheese tasting, test drive cars, drive up to Melaka and KL ... so many things one can do as a couple.

No need expensive BMW to enjoy life one.

Why not, whats the difference between pte properties & HDB other than some facilities & swimming pool? Unless you talking about landed housing with nice garden. 
 

My mother also like Condo, & tell me next time must buy condo for her to stay. So maybe I should get a condo (when I have money), & her existing HDB can rent out for some extra cash flow.  
 

I for one, do not fancy an kind of apartment, HDB or condo, unless all neighbors are chiobus.

Once you enter the league of buy sell house, 250k on a bmw doesnt sound right after all when you can down it on a decent 2 bedder and start earning passive income
 

The only pple who do this are either comfortable with at least 1-2 houses with comfi leverage so they can start evnjoy life, or those who are up to the neck with debt and a depreciating "asset"

Once you enter the league of buy sell house, 250k on a bmw doesnt sound right after all when you can down it on a decent 2 bedder and start earning passive income
 

The only pple who do this are either comfortable with at least 1-2 houses with comfi leverage so they can start evnjoy life, or those who are up to the neck with debt and a depreciating "asset"



 
 

$250k how to down on a decent 2 bedder and start earning anything?
 

my standard of a decent 2 bedder is $2mil

ok lets not use my standard.

say a decent 2 bedder is only $1mil
 

down $250k loan $750k , monthly rental not enough to cover loan and incidences.

and where does he stay? if he already has a place than downpayment is $400k for a $1mil aprt.

if he doesnt have a place it mean he will have to rent one.

so where is the income?  i see none.

If one is earning $10k per month, I would think he should not commit himself to more than $650k of loan...which should work out about $2.3k - $2.5k repayment per month with the low interest rate. As someone has mentioned, property is seen as an appreciating asset in Singapore. What's important is that the investment is wisely selected. If you refer to a recent news (http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/property-management-news/2012/7/33525/private-property-owners-making-big-gains), the second most profitable project for 1H2012 is an EC which turned 5 years last October. Hence, it appears that EC may be a viable investment.

Just wondering , with the property going up north , at what combined income do you think an average Singapore can afford a Pte property > $1.2m comfortably ? 
 

EC > $1m for combined income of 12k is it too pushy / risky ?



 

just an example
 

depend on your age..... you earn SGD$10,000 below 30 years old bank can loan you long long at current low interests rate and re-finance tenor after 2014 if interets increase slightly?
 

and at 30 years old long way to go....
 

but at SGD$10,000 at age 55 years and above?!?!? not very power lah.....

as long as u can pay downpayment then just go ahead and buy it!
 

cannot afford monthly debt service then just rent our a room. or two.
 

Still cannot pay then just sell the house. With PAP-induced property boom, sure can make a nice profit one.

The issue in Singapore is not about affordability.....it's the upside of the properties increase in value.

A $1.2million property will worth $2million in five years time.

So the issue of affordability is moot as one can sell it off easily for a huge profit.



 

If really 1.2 mil property worth 2mil in five yrs time.. who is buying from you? if you get a well-located unit,  2mil may be possible.. and some FT with huge $$ may be able to buy from you. Seriously, i dun see regular singaporean be able to buy from you if it really worth 2mil in 5 yrs.. Our salary dun climb that fast.
 

Seriously, it really depend on your holding power and not your mthly salary. If your family earns 20k a mth, but you do not need take any loan for 1.2 mil. I dun see why there is a relation. 
 

I think the more approriate question , how much loan can you afford if you only earn 20k a mth and cash buffer of less than 100k.

if you buy EC as your first home, with little saving.. i think it's abit sketch. 12k mthly income with little cash buffer. You may kena "big time" if you lose your job. 

if you buy EC as your 2nd home, with alot of saving...i think it's abit silly.

EC cannot be sold within 5 yrs, and another 10 yrs before it's privatise. Add another 4 yrs for it to be built.

By the time you can sell it for a good profit, you probably could have made double with pte properties.

Whether you can afford or tighten belts is another issue. The problem now is, the prices are so high. Yes. You may say, historically price for the last decade was creping steadily. But have you remember the 1998 days? And took another decade to move on par or slightly higher of pre-crises. The market is still hot at the moment. But I'm saying that the market will regress soon. If the market will to regress fast soon, worst still. You may have to up-top, if your loan to value falls fast. Secondly, if any of the couple lost job? I always on the safety side. If I will you, the private property should be solely funded by one, rather than 2. So 1 losses job, the other still can fund without straining the couple's finances.

The high prices now is different from the high prices of 1998. One of the main reason why property prices have been going up is due to the growth of population.
 

From the population census :
 

1998

Total population ('000) : 3,927.2

Singapore residents ('000) : 3,180.0
 
 

2011

Total population ('000) : 5,183.7

Singapore residents ('000) : 3,789.3
 

The other factor is that interest rate is currently at historical low. In 1998, the SIBOR actually hit it's record high before the crash. Property is always seen as a hedge against inflation (property is 25% of the CPI) and alot of the mass market property is supported by demand.
 

I have a friend who recently sold his condo and is looking for another property. From the sale of his condo, he got about 80k cash and I advised him to get a HDB thinking that it is more "affordable" but it may not be so. 
 

He told me that it doesn't make sense for him to get a HDB because he has to pay COV and spend money on renovation as well. He will end up spending between 30 - 50k minimum. On the other hand, he found a condo that is in move in condition and he just need to pay 5% cash with 15% coming out of CPF and the rest with a mortgage loan. Assuming he keep his cash outlay to 50k, he can buy a condo that cost 1 million. 
 

It isn't just private property prices going up, HDB prices are also going up alot. Mass market condo prices are supported by HDB prices. Alot of the recent mass market condos launch did well because there's demand from HDB dwellers.

Not sure but I heard that alot of the Watertown buyers stay in HDB and alot of them live in the same neighbourhood (Punggol). Apparently, quite a few of the buyers have already fully paid their HDB mortgages and they bought their Punggol HDB back in the days when it was cheap and nobody want to stay there.

Verdict is not out on Watertown yet. Alot of detractors saying that the prices are too high for a condo at Punggol etc etc. Seems like the remaining units are going between 13xx - 15xx psf which I think is really expensive as at that price point, you have alot of options. Most of the remaining units don't have Waterway view unless it is the suites which probably cost close to 2 million. Those that bought the units during the VVIP preview with waterway view got a good deal and higher chance for them to see capital appreciation when they want to sell.
 

For those that have been to Punggol recently, I think they can see that it will be an exciting place come 2015 when most of the BTOs/condos/facilities are up.
 

In the vicinity of Watertown, there's 2 condos (Treasure Trove and Parc Centros) and 3 BTOs (Waterway Terraces 1 and 2 + Punggol ParcVista). A new food centre/market is also coming up in the vicinity and the new Punggol Safra/Sports centre should be around the corner as well.

What do you think is a fair value ?
 

It seems that condos are typically priced at about additional $4xx psf and sometimes up to 2x the price psf that the developer paid for. Is that too excessive ?
 

With the price that developers are paying for the land right now, I don't think we can see the days when condos are selling for 6xx psf.

My opinion with regard to affordability is not that you must have xxxk before you even dare to get one. It is more of knowing the calculated risks involve and your hunger for the gain. Property here can only move up though there is this cyclical up-down-up-down thing, so important is the holding power and wait out. My parents-in-law are rank-and-file employees, yet able to upgraded from 3-rm flats, 4-rm flats, etc, etc, progressively all the way to landed property over the years. Just in May this year, they collected proceed of > $1mil cash from yet another enbloc sale. But immediately, most of it are plough back to get other property. 
 

I am not advocating reckless buying, but doing it within means and after doing all the sums. Being a little risky is ok so long as able to ride out the bad times. If not, with the education level and jobs, my in-laws would still be living in a 3-rm flat. It is important to have dreams and doing it.

Let me give a more realistic and down to earth opinion on this.

Some of the above posts are rubbish!
 

I would think to afford a 1.2mil condo, you would need a combined salary of 9k to 10k.
 

The monthly installment using cash component is around 1k.

  (this is assuming loan of 30 years and interest rate of around 2.5%)
 

Thus the remaining cash you bring hom after paying CPF and housing installment is around 6.5k.
 

This is enough for a family with 1 kid or 2 kids.

it is not foolish either.
 

its always a risk or gamble. a gamble you take that your property price will rise.

But isnt life a gamble anyway?
 

all my friends including myself did the same...our gamble paid off
 

- bought condo from developer.

- sold it at a relative nice profit after a few years

- use the extra money to buy a more expensive condo

- see again at profit

- and finally downgrade to a smaller condo with loads of cash.

my rule is not obviously everybody's rule. but its realistic, at least to me. everybody has different comfort levels. 
 

frankly, 10k combined, if the car is not 60k, i think you shouldnt buy. if must, buy an old COE car. of course, if the car is a means to generate income, thats a different story. 
 

a crash happens when people were unrealistic. if you were realistic, a crash doesnt bother you at all. actually no, a crash brings prices down to realistic levels, and your affordability goes up.

my rule of thumb. 
 

property, 5 year annual income, excluding bonus. 

car, 6 months income, excluding bonus.



 

Based on your rule of thumb ..... must be in the top bracket before can afford a low end condo or car ....
 

Assuming 70k per year including CPF and bonus ....
 

70k x 5 years =350k - No condo at this price ....
 

Even if make 100 k per year .....
 

100k x 5 = 500k - Not too many choices as well ....
 

Assuming, 8k per month ....
 

6 x 8k = 48k ..... can even pay for COE ....
 

10k per month ...
 

6 x 10k = 60k ...... just nice to pay for CAT A COE ...
 

IMO, I dun think that your rule of thumb is workable ...

how about, today's people or today's prices are unrealistic? 
 

ok, give you some stats. 
 

http://www.singstat.gov.sg/stats/themes/pe...hist/hhinc1.pdf

top 40% of households, make on average of 10k and up. How many % of the population stay in HDB? i think 60% sounds about right, of course we can check this quite easily (Ok found this: )http://www.singstat.gov.sg/stats/themes/pe...indicators.pdf). 10k/mth = 120k/year = 720k for a condo. thats the lowest of the low end condo. again, sounds about right. 
 

its ok to aspire to stay in a condo, but dont be unrealistic. the govt didnt pluck the increment from 10k to 12k as the ceiling for EC out of thin air. give them a bit of credit, heh. 
 

ditto for cars, but im lazy to do analysis already.

No need for analysis lah ... as you mentioned .... RULE OF THUMB .... 
 

120k per annual, 5 x 120k = 600 k ...... enough for a 3 BRs ???? Even a EC cost more ...
 

IMO, your rule of thumb is flawed .....

oops, math fail, sorry should've been 600k. 
 

again, its my rule, not for everybody. to me, 600k is the affordable price. 
 

but yah, your rule can be 10x for all i care, different people have different appetites. i am only sharing my rule.

What do you think is a fair value ?
 

It seems that condos are typically priced at about additional $4xx psf and sometimes up to 2x the price psf that the developer paid for. Is that too excessive ?
 

With the price that developers are paying for the land right now, I don't think we can see the days when condos are selling for 6xx psf.




Take WaterTown as an example, what is their Psf after removing the commercial component? 

Their ave selling price is 1200psf, what is their profit?

Ppl r expecting Parc Centros to price more or less the same as ATT cos the land for PC is cheaper, do you think Wee Hur will price it lower?

Some project make more $ than the others, but do some location worth that psf even tho developer may bid the land at low price years ago?

now i understand why people say dont be deceived by those who stay in HDB cos they can be even richer than those in EC and condo ... 
 

just look at the way they do their sum ... to buy car / condo must have x no of year of annual income 

before purchase else keep quiet and stay in HDB. meaning their actual Annual income is way above the ceiling of those set by HDB just they are most harsh in setting their own rules in going pte or get luxury cars ...

My opinion with regard to affordability is not that you must have xxxk before you even dare to get one. It is more of knowing the calculated risks involve and your hunger for the gain. Property here can only move up though there is this cyclical up-down-up-down thing, so important is the holding power and wait out. My parents-in-law are rank-and-file employees, yet able to upgraded from 3-rm flats, 4-rm flats, etc, etc, progressively all the way to landed property over the years. Just in May this year, they collected proceed of > $1mil cash from yet another enbloc sale. But immediately, most of it are plough back to get other property. 
 

I am not advocating reckless buying, but doing it within means and after doing all the sums. Being a little risky is ok so long as able to ride out the bad times. If not, with the education level and jobs, my in-laws would still be living in a 3-rm flat. It is important to have dreams and doing it.



 

the period of easy money from properties are probably over by this generation.

The high prices now is different from the high prices of 1998. One of the main reason why property prices have been going up is due to the growth of population.
 

From the population census :
 

1998

Total population ('000) : 3,927.2

Singapore residents ('000) : 3,180.0
 
 

2011

Total population ('000) : 5,183.7

Singapore residents ('000) : 3,789.3
 

The other factor is that interest rate is currently at historical low. In 1998, the SIBOR actually hit it's record high before the crash. Property is always seen as a hedge against inflation (property is 25% of the CPI) and alot of the mass market property is supported by demand.
 

I have a friend who recently sold his condo and is looking for another property. From the sale of his condo, he got about 80k cash and I advised him to get a HDB thinking that it is more "affordable" but it may not be so. 
 

He told me that it doesn't make sense for him to get a HDB because he has to pay COV and spend money on renovation as well. He will end up spending between 30 - 50k minimum. On the other hand, he found a condo that is in move in condition and he just need to pay 5% cash with 15% coming out of CPF and the rest with a mortgage loan. Assuming he keep his cash outlay to 50k, he can buy a condo that cost 1 million. 
 

It isn't just private property prices going up, HDB prices are also going up alot. Mass market condo prices are supported by HDB prices. Alot of the recent mass market condos launch did well because there's demand from HDB dwellers.



 
 

Bro , I have copied this previously I wrote. And still stand-by it.
 

Just in case you have missed these threads that I wrote earlier, on why I sold my property last year. You may visit my post number :

#4388456

#4388413

#4387942
 

On #4388413, I have copied over :
 

I have better ways to hedge, while using this new money to reinvest other than properties. Yaa.,.. ppl used to say, low interest rate are here is stay, bank savings interest rates are super low, bank loans are like free money, land are scare, new Singaporeans are here to stay and so on...... But have anyone consider the downside risks :
 

1. Low bank interest rate will not stay for 30years.

2. Rental yields may regress and compress when interest rates are up, more housing have started to flood the market. Current rental yields are a low of 3 - 4% ? When the bank interest start to revert, you have near 0 -1% yield. That is lucky, if you don't get negative. 

3. HDB have been building like no body business. Remember, it takes 10 over years for property to pick up after the last downturn during 1998. Those days HDB are flooded and had caused private property to be depressed. 

4. The property prices have move too far away from average income earners. Couples have to work in order to keep the private property. (Keep working for the banks till you are 50s or 60s)

5. Worry of one losses job and cannot repayment banks installments. This is a long and large commitment. Jobs today are filmsly. 

6. Outflow of FTs have yet began. Recent gov. policies are starting to give the FTs a difficult one. 
 
 

After doing my sum and probables, was better to off load, since the returns was $350+K pure profits. Since I can no long able to generate a yield of more than 4%, I would rather add-on to my portfolio, which have been generating 9 - 12%. Besides that, I can spread the risk, rather than concentrated a large potion of investment which is illiquid. I am not saying the property market will come down soon. But I just don't know when this replay ends like. I maybe out in the early stages of property boom. If everyone knows when the last train to catch, there will be no property cycles. Aleast my HDB flat was paid up 5 years back and do not need to work hard for the bank, accept 4.5 years loan of my car which I can pay up anytime. Is good to have a private property, but at which cycle you are in, that matter to me. Last but not least, I often hear this, " It cannot goes wrong, when you follow the crowd rational". 

I have a better ways to spread and hedge for better yields. No thanks for me, aleast now. While generating better yield spread, I can wait of the property market to regress, before making inroads with more choices. If you were telling me 5 -6 years ago, property invest are great, I believe, but not at the juncture

Firstly, i grew up in a HDB from 5 yrs old until 27 yrs old .

An Elite to me is a foreign word.
 

it's good to know oneself and not try to be what one isnt.
 

eg.  1. Goons who go overseas just for a few years and come back with some silly thick accent.

2.  Acting high class just becos one's address does not start with a "Blk" 

3.  Buying branded goods regardless of the awful design so that one can be seen as stylish and tasteful

I think most ppl are observing this rules.. dun assume that all owners of pte pty are taking big loans. Alot 2nd time home-owner to have ablities to pay off the mortgage within 10 yrs. Many I know are fully aware of the us/eu risk and tends to be very careful in their investment. 
 

Those buy luxury cars, esp during the 2007-2010 period, generally pay in full or loan min to get disc.  B&B owners has big loan obligation.

I not stupid lah my benchmark is 20k and I still find it risky 

 I just find it weird why some people can go around tell people They own a 1m ++ EC when their combined is just 10k how to afford !!!



 

10k nett(after CPF) actually can.
 

5k/mth x 12=60k/year
 

20 years=1.2m.
 

can clear in 20 years or less if its cheap condo in non mature estate
 

every mth still got 5k to spare.
 

assuming no car, its enough.

Actually no need to run round in circles. 
 

Just 'stress test' it, at worst case scenario. 
 

My view, Assume work up to 55, loan tenure adjust accordingly. 
 

1) 40% down on house. 

2) Calculate installments at 5% i/r

3) 2 year's worth of installments @ 5% , plus 1 years' worth of living expenses in cash.    
 

I think very safe liao like that. 

If you can clear these, you can afford it. 

My assumptions:
 

a) Property market is not likely to tank 40%. 

Thus top-ups are not very likely. 
 

b) Average interest rates are around 3-4%

5% as reasonable buffer. 
 

c) Assuming you lose your job, for an extended period in a bad economic downturn. 

(in a bad situation, i/r might be lower anyway) 

You have a 2 year buffer before you get forced sold. 

On top of that you have 1 year's expenses. 
 

Should be fine in at least 80% of situations.

1) 40% down on house. 

2) Calculate installments at 5% i/r

3) 2 year's worth of installments @ 5% , plus 1 years' worth of living expenses in cash.    
 

I think very safe liao like that. 

If you can clear these, you can afford it. 

My assumptions:
 

a) Property market is not likely to tank 40%. 

Thus top-ups are not very likely. 
 

b) Average interest rates are around 3-4%

5% as reasonable buffer. 
 

c) Assuming you lose your job, for an extended period in a bad economic downturn. 

(in a bad situation, i/r might be lower anyway) 

You have a 2 year buffer before you get forced sold. 

On top of that you have 1 year's expenses. 
 

Should be fine in at least 80% of situations.

Li ka shing came to HK penniless, started by selling plastic flowers.
 

So is he elite or not?



 

Yes. He is elites there after. 
 

Hard work done behind the screen, and slow emerge as elite. I have when through that too. Still remember those days during my first job, got scolded by my Manager then, most of the time. With good attitude and pick up whenever was down by something. Back to Li ka shing or run run shaw. They all have been through hardship and who knows these people back than.

Before I state,  laugh loud..loud if you like. Since this is a little sensitive and cannot review actual, is upper range btw 170k - 240k/yr. Anyway I am not consider the high-flyer of ED and still new in this position, but same firm. Most money I accumulate over 19years on my portfolio, was mainly gains from investments, not my salary previously.

 170k - 240k bonus is not bad  for a bank ED.  But times are bad lah.  Cannot compare to pre 2008 bonuses.

my rule of thumb. 
 

property, 5 year annual income, excluding bonus. 

car, 6 months income, excluding bonus.




Yes agree.

I had earlier proposed my rule of thumb for car purchase to be abt 50% of annual salary.

But a lot reacted negatively that liddat either cannot buy car at all, or can only buy cheap entry level model.

But that's exactly the litmus test to show that one is a marginal owner and that it would be best for him not even to buy a car!

Maybe perhaps an old used, or COE car, if he really needs personal transportation.
 

For property, my rule of thumb would be 3-4 times the combined spouses' annual incomes.

If anyone were to say that they cannot afford a condo liddat, then eat humble pie to accept that perhaps a BTO or DBSS, or a HDB resale is all that you can consider ... for now.
 

Most in the sandwiched class ... families with a combined income of $250K and below just cannot accept it!

They are the govt's biggest worry, no, fear!

Seriously what is $250k a year? Why are we even quibbling about it, like it is some big deal?
 

I will be 36 this year, all my banker and lawyer friends around my age (plus or minus 1 or 2 years) make at least that amount before bonuses, and the high flying ones make more than double that.  And they tend to marry people of the same income and career level.  So you can figure out how much the dual income professional married couples around my age make.
 

Do I have a warped sense of reality when it comes to annual salaries?  I dunno.  Cos the only people I know who make under $200k a year are like 5 to 10 years younger than I am, or are just starting out.
 

Seriously, people like throttle2 and a few others are in here just to check out how "the other side" live.  I am sure they are amused at the low salaries many of you are making and the aspirations you have. And you people are playing into their hands, entertaining them.  The taxes that they pay on their yearly income are more than some of your annual salaries. This I am very very sure.
 

So just stop talking about such topics cos there is always one mountain higher than another.
 

And if you are not in that strata of salaries already, just face up to the reality that you will never ever reach that level, at least not while you're still being employed in some junior or middle management or technical capacity.
 

Either you go out to become a business man to have a shot at making it big or just be content with what you have.

wah lao, me again?  *slap head* dont single me out leh.

i am just a regular joe.
 

but i shant say that your sense of reality is warped , only that it is true in a smaller and more specific area of the entire economy.

thank your stars if you already belong to that group becos many of us are slugging it out.
 

however we envy these guys not, as in life it is always a trade off.

and the scariest thing is you sometimes dont know what you have traded off your next paycheck with.
 

at the end of the day, integrity,kindness and generosity are the real measurements of one's achievements.
 

i like your "one mountain higher than another". 

so often quoted yet so rarely understood.
 

beware, you get branded as "haolian", muayhahahahahaa.
 

take it easy now
 

yours sincerely,

The Table-Wiper.

Well. I advise is never do that. It's too dangerous to have a concentrated investments. Worst off, a property is ill-liquid. Spread your risk. We just duno when the next downturn hits. Even with the economy improve, the interest rate rise will eventually hits you. But sad to say, not many know how to do it yourself investing. So the easy way is to follow the crowd. Classic words "You can't be wrong far by follow the crowd".

good planning 

assuming husband ($5k) + wife ($5k), combined = $10K
 

house = $10k x 12 x 5 years = $600k

car = $10k x 6 months = $60k (toyota corolla before coe gone crazy) 
 

but, the above family probably getting mass market 99LH condo @ $1M + entry level conti @ $125K ...

Know yourself is best. I know that the more input info, people tend to laugh loud..loud.  So have to live modestly. Dun over spend. With that salary I have, may not see much more increments from here, since believe could be the last destination of the corporate ladder. 10 year later, my buying power may reduce. So have to spend wisely and continue to invest properly.

now i understand why people say dont be deceived by those who stay in HDB cos they can be even richer than those in EC and condo ... 
 

just look at the way they do their sum ... to buy car / condo must have x no of year of annual income 

before purchase else keep quiet and stay in HDB. meaning their actual Annual income is way above the ceiling of those set by HDB just they are most harsh in setting their own rules in going pte or get luxury cars ...



 

pple who haven't arrived need the big car and big house to show they have arrived
 

pple who have arrived, either been there done that, no need to do it again, or find it totally unnecessary since they already arrived. yesterday i juz met a big boss from a listed co (self made millionaire, not the salaried CEO type).. just changed his 2nd hand s80 to 2nd hand e200 (and its the previous model somemore). and it's not a small time listco, this guy has got his own building in orchard road. pple like this already have all the recognition they can get, dun need a nice car to top it off

Do I have a warped sense of reality when it comes to annual salaries?  I dunno.  Cos the only people I know who make under $200k a year are like 5 to 10 years younger than I am, or are just starting out.
 

Seriously, people like throttle2 and a few others are in here just to check out how "the other side" live.  I am sure they are amused at the low salaries many of you are making and the aspirations you have. And you people are playing into their hands, entertaining them.  The taxes that they pay on their yearly income are more than some of your annual salaries. This I am very very sure.
 

So just stop talking about such topics cos there is always one mountain higher than another.
 

And if you are not in that strata of salaries already, just face up to the reality that you will never ever reach that level, at least not while you're still being employed in some junior or middle management or technical capacity.
 

Either you go out to become a business man to have a shot at making it big or just be content with what you have.



 

I agree. I work in a financial institution but not all earn that much la. At the end of the day, the usual people that makes most is always related to SALES. I do agree however there are people easily making 250K before bonuses by the age of 30 if they're in the right place at the right time. ONe of my cousin is one of them and yes, they either have difficulty finding their soul mate or will find one that is around the same level. To be fair, those are like the top 20% of friends that I know. Unless all your friends are those top end ones    , if not, a few K a month is still majority la

There is one of the thread in this section about salary2011 which mention that the median income of condo dwellers is 14K per month. So there is it. I think no need to keep starting threads asking such questions (like how much before can own a car or how much income before one will buy a luxury car) which seriously is becoming boring.

Just wondering , with the property going up north , at what combined income do you think an average Singapore can afford a Pte property > $1.2m comfortably ?
 
EC > $1m for combined income of 12k is it too pushy / risky ?

combined income of 12k is more than enough to afford a condo <$2m. but that is if you have no kids, no mistress, no vices. 
 
assuming your definition of "comfortable" means having 2 kids and still being able to afford a meal at a restaurant every weekend, and spend on some other frivolous stuff, try to get a condo no more than $1.5m
 
i know this myself because my parents' combined income is 10k and they bought a private condo just above punggol mrt for 1.6m with 2 childrens, me and my bro. my grandma also stays with us. 
 
their plans to finance the condo is to lease out our current hdb and their cpf can tahan the payment for 4 years. with your combined income of 12k, i believe you have more than enough cpf to help you tahan a few years. if it's EC, gov will help subsidize. if you do have a car now, hopefully you buy a condo which is near mrt and bus interchange then sell off your car if you have one. 
 
just note that if you do have children, you'd have to slave another 20-30 years unless your kids are earning enough by then to help pay off the condo if they intend to stay on with you. also do buy insurance to keep yourself covered incase any of the breadwinners if your family fall severely ill. my parents bought an insurance scheme in which if any one of them pass on, the condo will be paid in full.

Why need to earn so much to stay in condo?  There are so many cheap 2/3 bedroom condos in the market under 1m , even cheaper than some hdb flats.

Actually if the person is retired,  can stay anywhere in Singapore doesn't really matter.  Staying near city is only relevant to those who work in the city.  I for one hardly go to the city coz my life revolves around in one part of the island only.

For me, whatever works works. If Govt say you clear TDSR, I think is sufficient. In fact, zero income also can but must be 50% paid up and call yourself retiree (newest TDSR update).

I find the property market sometimes super irrational. Some people would just willingly pay a million bucks for an overpriced hdb to have people urinating around at your corridor, zero security n zero facilities,  but are not willing to pay a million for a 3 bedroom condo with full condo facilities and walking distance to mrt. Location is relative to the person's needs,  and not everything in the CCR is relevant to everyone.

The ironical thing is if a person can afford a 2 million condo,  they can easily afford a car,  so why bother with being near mrt.

I'm always wondering.  
Why will anyone choose a condo in punggol when there are millions of new Hdb flats adjacent it?
 
And when comes to selling. Whos gonna buy? Imagine the viewer stand in your condo unit and ask the agent how much is the hdb just beside asking for. 
 
Why not use the same money for a bigger resale HDB flat at a better location?

That is a good point. I don't understand the mentality of those paying 700k for a 99yr 400+sqft one bedder condo when the surrounding 1200sqft 5 room hdb flats are going for only 500k. The 200k difference can buy a transferable country club membership n a car some more.

Your"better"  location is relative , if one buy for investment, then town area or matured estate is "better" but for one who buy a home to live for a long time, he might prefer a "better" one at ulu place, quite, have greenery,  and not crowded ... Same goes for one will buy a million dollar 5rm hdb beside mrt but don't drive and another one might buy a 500k hdb away from mrt but drive a Conti car, etc...

Was quite surprised to hear friend's family pay $700k for a 4-room HDB near Toa Payoh central. Plus they have a car so doesn't really need to be very near MRT. If this is for investment purposes, I'm just wondering if the flat price can still increase substantially in the next 5 years for them to buy their planned condo.

People buying ec/condo is for status and face value lo. Even their ec/condo is next to a hdb block and cost more and smaller, but they will feel more atas as their flat is private.

The ironical thing is if a person can afford a 2 million condo,  they can easily afford a car,  so why bother with being near mrt.Many people  who could  afford 2mil property but choose not to drive for many reasons. Eg avoid daily traffic jam to office, offcie have no season parking, office near MRT, not all family members drive a car. So near MRT is certainly  a key consideration.

Absolutely, but those people living in the swanky condos in your estate probably dont know that their condo is literally sitting IN your estate.  Moreover, the slum home of yours, has the landsize to fit a real slum.
 
 
Heeehheeee, dont whack me back ok? weekend morning, joke joke a bit.
Cigar on me ok?
The difference I see between condo-HDB is condo prevent door-to-door sales and less junk mails. Other then perceived "higher" class feel. 
 
Then how would general landed property owner feel compare to condo owner?
 
No visitor carpark, no swimming pool
No security, no lift, have door-to-door salesman & junkmails
 
To each his own.
One spend money to look rich or 
Another look average with money to spend.
 
Except we have many in MCF which have plenty of money and looked rich.

I prefer to use the term how much can we save a month after all our spendings a month.
 
Maids. Cars. Tuitons. Fees. Makan. Etc. Give parents. Medical.
 
If can setaside 8k to 10k a month in savings... maybe doable getting that condo u want.
 
What kind of lifestyle one wants...
Some stay hdb. Rent out their condos. Or vice versa.... as hdb rental yield is better than renting out a condo. A 500k hdb might fetch 3k a month rental. A 1m condon may just fetch 3k also... depends on location.
 
Some ppl earn 12k a month spend 4k. Some spend 10k. Etc.
Also to add on.
 
How much cash savings one have.
 
For a 1.2m condo... how much cash outlay ones want to lay....
 
More the better i feel. Maybe i more traditional. Better to service the loan quicker so to have a peace of mind.

Bro, I am truly upset with you.
 
Why in the world should you envy those people and look down on yourself?
 
You should be VERY proud of yourself. There will always be people above us (material goods and education) and always be people below us. Just why don't you compare with those people below you instead. Then you will feel very grateful for what you have.
 
Let me share with you some truths about what you see is not what you get.
 
I have business associates who stay in good class bungalow but do not have a single property to their name (because all rental to show clients how well they are doing).
 
Just like when see all these Ferraris and Mercedes (there are a number bought out of necessity in the name of business and some are struggling to keep up with their loan payments).
 
Those staying in Swanky condos, do you know how many regret making the decision to shift from HDB or EC to CONDO. Just remember, even if you retired or out of job, management fees still have to be paid.
 
This is not about putting these people who have made it down BUT rather enjoy and be proud of what you have. Suppose if you have attained enough to buy a swanky condo, then what, not happy see neighbour buy helicopter. You then aspired to buy a Boeing.
 
Material things including housing are items to make life easier for you and should NOT be used to judge the level of quality of life you have.
 
In short, good to compare, but always be grateful for you have and enjoy what you have. Life is too short, to suffer to acquire these material things that do not necessarily make your live happier.
 
There is only 24 hours in a day. How many hours have you spent miserable about how envious you are about your neighbour and etc? Then count the number of hours you sleep. Add them and what you left for your enjoyment each day. Very little.
if only the whole of SG shares your sentiments.....

Many people who could afford 2mil property but choose not to drive for many reasons. Eg avoid daily traffic jam to office, offcie have no season parking, office near MRT, not all family members drive a car. So near MRT is certainly a key consideration.
 
Spending 2 mil on a 99yr condo (as most condos near mrt are 99yr) just to squeeze like sardine in a train during peak hours to and from the office must be quality of life for some.

The difference I see between condo-HDB is condo prevent door-to-door sales and less junk mails.
Other then perceived "higher" class feel.
 
Then how would general landed property owner feel compare to condo owner?
 
No visitor carpark, no swimming pool
No security, no lift, have door-to-door salesman & junkmails
 
To each his own.
One spend money to look rich or
Another look average with money to spend.
 
Except we have many in MCF which have plenty of money and looked rich.

 
I think it all boils down to the term 'quality of life'. Looking good to others does not equate to having a good quality of life. A person can spend on a 2 million condo near MRT or 5 million on a terrace house but slog like a dog all day in the office which does not make that person's quality of life a good one. To top it up, the person may not even be using the condo facilities at all despite paying so much in monthly maintenance.  However, the person who lives in a 5 room HDB flat costing only 500k may be having a lot of free time with the family and use the surrounding amenities to the max. Many a time, it is not what we have that is important but what we do with it to enrich our lives.

Bro, I am truly upset with you.
 
Why in the world should you envy those people and look down on yourself?
 
You should be VERY proud of yourself. There will always be people above us (material goods and education) and always be people below us. Just why don't you compare with those people below you instead. Then you will feel very grateful for what you have.
 
Let me share with you some truths about what you see is not what you get.
 
I have business associates who stay in good class bungalow but do not have a single property to their name (because all rental to show clients how well they are doing).

not up not low but stuck in the middle like a thin cheese between the bun and high class Kobe beef

To be honest, I also support that HDB is a good choice for use as a home. 
 
But there are many restrictions and likely even more coming in the future if one solely depends on HDB.
 
For example, it is possible for a couple to own two condos or one private and one HDB but not two HDB.
 
The day they allow a couple to own two HDBs I will sell everything and buy two HDBs either new or resale.

KNN lah, until today you all still dont understand?
IT 's the freaking FACE, STATUS, RATRACE, KEEPING UP with JONES ...
 
Do i need to explain further?
Of course die die must stretch the dollar and buy a "condo" lah
Nevermind even if it is nestled right in the middle of 200blocks of HDB.
Nevermind even if the HDB neighbor 10m away can peer into my "condo" unit
Lap it up, lap it up.  
See my half gold Rolex on 24 mth instalment , 0% interest leh, smart or not?
 
By now more than half of you are already cursing and swearing at me.

household income at $14k at mid 30s to mid 40s should maybe stay hdb, take public transport and enjoy life, using the savings to bring up the next generation or if no have next generation, save it for retirement and future medical needs.
 
i am a bit prudent in terms of housing, ie, the place one lives it, not the one for investment etc. must always make sure basic stay, food, education, savings, retirement needs are satisfied first before taking the extra cash for other investment and wayang purposes.

Honestly, there are some pros of staying in a condo vs HDB and it is not for the wayang purpose kind.
 
Generally speaking (not true for all), condo are better maintained and security within the compound is better. Environment also nicer and quieter if not nestled near a busy road/junction.
 
Not saying that hdb cannot be such. it can be but is dependent on which hdb estate you are located in. my ex hdb place, i think, is one of those rare gems in singapore. well connected by public transport to town/cdb, generally quiet, clean external environment helped by considerate neighbours and hardworking town council cleaning contractors and close to wet market and good food. was really reluctant to move if not for the estate growing older and growing family needs.
 
if i am retired, i'll prob move to a hdb near the pasir ris outskirt. it is pretty serene out there, but not not the most convenient spot in singapore (my opinion) if you still need to go to town often.

You are absolutely right bro.
 
Condos are suppose to be better for those reasons
But i can tell you that many are not.
The problem is not just the physical state of the place
It is also the people living there.

I personally think Singapore is a lousy place to own more than 1 property. Lousy rental yield with the prospect of an upward movement in mortgage rates is a recipe for disaster. Just look at the current market of sellers now,  some condos between 1 and 2 million jn the resale segment have been stuck for months with no buyers. Buy these condos for investment also neither here nor there coz who wants to pay 1.2 million for something that can only rent 2k plus? Agents will tell you 2%+ gross rental yield is a norm these days, and this is during a low interest rate environment. 
You are absolutely right bro.

Your immediate and all neighbours is one important deciding factor if you want to continue staying in any place.
 
Just generalising here but given that a HDB estate is relatively more congested than a condo estate, with the same % of siao lang distribution in any sample/population, there will be more siao lang in a HDB estate than in a condo who can make your living there hell.
 
I used to have:
1 x pyscho spinster immediate neighbour who luckily don't stay in much - no one can stand her.
1 x girl living a few floors and units away from me who likes to break curfew hours, then father will not let her in and she will be screaming, cursing and shouting in the corridor at 12 midnight.
 
but in that hdb, i also have many nice neighbours who are quiet and keep their areas clean (maybe only my floor).
 
and i have also been to some (new) mass mkt condos and residents think they own everything within, and keep all their shoes, bicycles, laundry etc all outside the corridor, making the whole place an eye sore. the development looks so good on the outside but when i step in, there is dismal.
 
and who can forget the everitt road episode. right?
 
anyway, no matter where you stay (hdb, condo, landed), good considerate neighbours is a must. after that, most other things will hopefully fall in place. and i think we should always aim to be debt free for our primary residence where we can and in the shortest time possible so that we can allocate extra cash to other areas of our lives.
 
Neighbours can suck for both private and hdb. I feel the main factors that draw people to live in condos other than hdb are only 2 things - security and facilities. For hdbs you can have all kinds of nonsensical people lurking outside your door and you can't chase them away coz it is public space. People can also dump fliers at your door 365 days a year n it is beyond your control. There is also this issue of foreign workers hanging around at your void deck.

there is another reason but only applies to some: you cannot legally keep cats in a hdb unit. that old rule needs to be reviewed asap. whoever who continues saying that rule applies has definitely not read and researched wide enough. and boo to them!

Bro, your concern is valid but only because you are looking at it from one angle. 
Firstly rent can neither stay high or low for too long - they exist as part of a cycle. This is inevitable in SG context, we either have too few properties for rent or too many and the cycles will continue to progress.
 
Secondly, HDB yield is very high, sometimes exceeding 10%. We need to understand the total yield from a holistic angle considering all properties and overall yield. Someone who is flexible enough in thinking will understand what it is I am trying to say.

i no stay in mass mkt condo so won't know the feeling but i don't like crowded living spaces. so if pool is crowded esp with screaming children, then i definitely won't be at the pool.
14k can afford one jap car comfortably, housing hdb can le, staying in condo will become slave n pay monthly fees just to enjoy the facilities which in my view is a waste of $
well, if it's me, then i won't buy the car. esp if the $14k is earned by only one person with no one to spread the risk to. imagine kanna retrenched. at mid 30s to mid 40s, will be difficult to find another job paying you $14k. that's why i rather reduce transport expenditure.
 
but then, to each, his/her own.

When investing in properties I look at each investment for its own merit and don't take one good investment to square off against a lousy investment. Most people don't knowingly sink into one bad property investment knowing they have made good in another.

I was stating the draw factors for condo vs hdb living but you are of course right in that seow lang can pop up anywhere. What I am concerned about is when seow lang encountered outside your hdb doorstep, you cannot chase away since it is public space. Condo you can usually just call the guard to handle any strangers lurking at your corridor. As for landed, it is worse than condo coz you have no control over the space outsude your gate.

The idea is not squaring but taking a holistic approach.
 
For example, the current HDB or private housing that one is staying in may have an excellent rental yield of 8 or 10%. Maybe location is suited for expats who don't drive. But because you are staying in it, there is no way to utilise the 8 or 10% at all.
 
The only way to release it, is to live elsewhere, that may have a mediocre rental rate but is a place you can utilise the value (for example, closer to parents, closer to desired Pri school, children can use newer and better facilities etc). For example, it could be a reclusive spot and as you drive, your family can enjoy the peace and also ease of driving, to reach anything you want fast but not be caught in the congestion.
 
The holistic assessment makes the investment much more worth it. It also requires a greater degree of self understanding and assessment.
 
 
When investing in properties I look at each investment for its own merit and don't take one good investment to square off against a lousy investment. Most people don't knowingly sink into one bad property investment knowing they have made good in another.

That is squaring off one good investment against a poor investment, intangible benefits aside.

In fact, for own stay, most reasons are intangible.

There is a lot of nonsensical comments in this thread to what is a real question. Here is my comments:
 
1. There is no correct salary figure to gauge whether you can afford a condo. Because the 2 big variables are the loan amount/tenure you are taking, and your monthly expenses excluding the home loan.
 
A simple example would be if you are taking 0% loan and paying full cash, your salary can be $2000 a month and you can afford a condo.
 
Or you earn $20,000 a month, but your Wife , kids and Mistress expenses cost $18,000 then you cannot afford a condo
 
2. But for the sake of getting a general idea. Let us then look at the average upper middle income family with 2 kids considering a condo. very generally you would spend
 
Food 1k, (include groceries, lunch at work, kids meals, weekend meals)
utilities and phone for all 500, 
2 kids books, tuition, courses 2k, 
both side parents 1k, 
transport 1k, 
general spending 1k, (maintenance, clothes, haircut, shoes, birthdays)
Insurance for all 1k
Savings 1k
 
That is about 8k (excludes any holidays Budget)
 
Assume a basic condo now, 1.3 million. 80% Maximum loan about 1 million, 30 yr tenure, using cpf loan calculator, your instalment is $4000 a month 
 
https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/Schemes/MonthlyInstallment/MonthlyInstallmentCalculate
 
So that generally means you need minimally about $12,000 total income to afford a basic condo. 
Which is not far off what the government has set as ceiling for EC (scholars don't pluck out figures from the air)
 
Of course another variable is your cpf usage for loan installments vs using cash, but that is out of scope for my simple example
 
3. Let us not belittle anyone who aspires to buy a mass market condo, and call them stupid for wanting to buy a condo surrounded by HDB
 
a. It could be to stay near aged parents
 
b. It could be their life aspiration to achieve it as a personal goal. They might know they can never afford a landed property in their lifetime, or a condo in Nassim road. Perhaps they came from a poor family, whose parents was not able to give them a helping hand up the property ladder.
 
And this is the best that they can work towards. To me, I respect them. They bought their mass market condo with their own blood sweat and tears. Who are we who are more fortunate financially to sneer at them.
 
Fxxk that. Live your own lives guys, be proud of what you have achieved or aim to achieve regardless of what others say.

Bro, I read your post with great interest, unfortunately, you are telling that our authorities, who based nearly everything on salary are wrong. If you earn less than $X you can apply x room HDB flat, if you earn more than $Y you can apply for EC flat.
 
Your examples you gave are not your average typical citizens. Just how many can buy full cash a condo property with a salary of $2000 (not to think about how they are going to pay for their monthly maintenance). How many must die so the few can inherit cash to do that.
 
But all that is said, you were absolutely right that if we don't live within our means, if we are unlucky, misfortune and misery will bestow upon us.

Try having a nice decent swim at mass market condo pool on a weekend.
Flooded with hdb folks next door, hee hee hee.
So much for private living.

Condo is private but strata (shared) living, private private living is landed lah.  HDB is community living.

It should be over actual purchase price I feel, then again to get the real yield you should also account for
 
- MCST cost
- Property Tax
- Loan interest
- All another LJ cost (Agent fee, repairs and other simi sai)

How should rental yield be calculated? Rental income / the price your buy your property or the most recent transaction price of a unit near yours?It depends on whether you are calculating gross or nett yield. For gross yield,  you take rental income for a year ÷ property purchase price. For nett yield,  you have to take annual rental after deducting property tax, condo maintenance,  agent commission, mortgage interest per year then ÷ by purchase price of property.

Basically no meat already, thats why can buy to stay and use as always but not much of an investment case.  As for capital gains, thats really anyones guess.

I find the property market sometimes super irrational. Some people would just willingly pay a million bucks for an overpriced hdb to have people urinating around at your corridor, zero security n zero facilities,  but are not willing to pay a million for a 3 bedroom condo with full condo facilities and walking distance to mrt. Location is relative to the person's needs,  and not everything in the CCR is relevant to everyone.Yes very irrational so don't expect mkt to be rationalPpl buy condo for many reasons:
Need a place to stay
Investment
Facilities
Security
To feel like they made it
To show off to relatives or friends staying in hdb
To pass on to children
Like the feng shui

How should rental yield be calculated? Rental income / the price your buy your property or the most recent transaction price of a unit near yours?I feel it should be the most recent transacted price. After all, imagine if you buy place for 100k and rents it out for 10k a year giving you a yield of 10%. 
Price went up and it's worth 1000k but rental is still 10k a year. Are you still going to assume that your property is fetching you 10% yield? The wise thing would be to sell The property and use the money for something else assuming you can get a yield better than 1%.
 
That is why rising interest rates is so dangerous to property prices in so many ways.

i think along the same line too.
 
Yield should be  rental income / most recent transacted price to reflect what would have been your opportunity cost if you had liqudated the property and invest in another instrument.
 
Using an aged purchase price is not really right. imagine you have a 3 room flat and you bought the property in the 70s for $10k. And now, you can rent out the place for say $2k which makes it a whopping 240% pa. but if that property is worth $300k in the market, then your yield will be a lot less at 8% (which is still a decent return).
 
And of course, to include all those incidentals like property tax, interest etc.

Uncle, hypothetical example lah. Notice I use 10k, 100k, 1000k numbers to simplify the Maths .....
 
The idea is the same though. I assume one wants to calculate yield for investment purposes and not for fun. If u want to use it to make an investment decision, it should always be the current property value.

rental yield is poor now due to competition.  too many people buy now and rent out their condo.  now redhill condo can be rented at 3.5-3.8k when before this flood of condos arrived, they were renting for 4.6-5k.  they pay developer high price and yet collect so low rent now, the yield is going to be atrocious.  interestingly i saw one ad for condo in this area, they cleverly list the rent $/psf instead of yield as part of their advertisement.  needless to say, with a shrunked size of the new developments, it will make the $/psf look decent.
 
i am amazed 400+ units of grandeur park snapped up and 200+ units of clement canopy when launched.
 
when i read, most of the units sold for the former are 1 bedder.  tanah merah area is already full of condo.  i wonder what these people see in the prospects to be so ready to buy.  are they happy with 2% or below yield?  so low yield might as well invest elsewhere.

If you put in 1mil cash plus CPF then use the property value as denominator. 
But do you pay up 1mil?
 
Anyway by now it should be too late the get the lowest interest rate. More waiting ahead for the interest rate significant raise plus economy downturn plus property price that you were waiting for. Good luck bro.

rental yield is poor now due to competition.  too many people buy now and rent out their condo.  now redhill condo can be rented at 3.5-3.8k when before this flood of condos arrived, they were renting for 4.6-5k.  they pay developer high price and yet collect so low rent now, the yield is going to be atrocious.  interestingly i saw one ad for condo in this area, they cleverly list the rent $/psf instead of yield as part of their advertisement.  needless to say, with a shrunked size of the new developments, it will make the $/psf look decent.
 
i am amazed 400+ units of grandeur park snapped up and 200+ units of clement canopy when launched.
 
when i read, most of the units sold for the former are 1 bedder.  tanah merah area is already full of condo.  i wonder what these people see in the prospects to be so ready to buy.  are they happy with 2% or below yield?  so low yield might as well invest elsewhere.
The way these people calculate yield are different. 
Right, wrong, better, worse? We can wait and see.

All these new units being snapped up is not all that surprising. Guys on the ground already know. Developers don't throw in hundreds of millions to gamble unless they have a high degree of confidence

yeah, i have no doubts about the developer's acumen.  this is the same exact reason the ceo of propnex put forward when i attended his talk.
 
i am more intrigued by what great buy these people worked out in their mind. i think people just have nowhere to park their cash and they see property as a safe harbour to park their excess cash.

These days when you park your money in highly priced condos,  just be prepared to get stuck. It is very easy for people to sink into a 1.5 mil condo in the suburbs during launch,  but these buyers never ask themselves if it would be easy for them to offload at 1.7mil or higher few years down the road if they decide to sell, not forgetting HDB are also direct competitors with condos.

agree.  that's why i label them novice.  they think it is safe harbour to park the money there.
 
i don't think so.  property incurs a lot of transaction cost and with low yields people would eventually think of offloading it sometime down the road.  when they need to offload, that's when they have to start worrying about losses when their competitor can afford to sell much cheaper because they have a much lower entry price.

I know someone who rented out his Hdb maisonette in the suburban east for about 2.8k a month and rented a 1.4 mil 3 bedroom freehold condo in bukit timah area for only 2.5k. I always see rental as a way to gauge whether it is worth paying a certain price for a condo.

yes.  actually looking at the low rent now, i find renting more worth it.  last time pay $5k rental for 1.5m condo now pay rental $3.6k for 1.6m condo.  if those got hdb to rent out, even better.  almost like get upgraded to condo housing and yet still got subsidised to stay in condo.

Those that stay put in the hdb market now will have plenty of options few years down the road,  those die die must buy a new launch condo now,  I can only wish them good luck.

Peak? I thought you said SRX undervalued your property at least 4 to 5%. 
The best is yet to come. Wait patiently for URA 2017 Q1 report. The stars are all aligned. The scripts are all pre-written already.

I think many people have received inheritance money and hence suddenly cash rich...  
 
singaporeans being prudent.. would not see it as a windfall.. but rather as an investment into future..  
 
added with land scarce singapore ... our property prices will only keep rising...
 
ageing population also = 2 parents pass on to 1 child..

My property price went up 28% from 2011 to present. I mentioned srx undervalued my pty in comparison to bank now, not the time I bought. I feel pte property prices around Singapore have more potential for downside than upside, but it is anyone's guess.

I would applaud both your friend and also the landlord.
 
Firstly, the owners obviously are awaiting enbloc in a matter of 5-15 years or so. 999 years leasehold left 800+ years lease. The high holding price is for that purpose. There is much land value in holding, want to find also very rare. 
 
Secondly, your friend is able to save much as he/she can rent a 25 year-old condo, where much of the facilities are either worn down or non-existent, needing much more in maintenance, which the landlord is paying for, as enbloc premium.
 
My point is, for rental yield purchases, very few buyers would opt for the specific type you chose. There are much much better choices, nobody is forcing you to buy this or use the extreme example to calculate...

99 yr condos with not much capital retention value usually fair better in rental yield compared to 999yr or fh, but I won't bother touching those if holding for anything above 5 years. Anyway,  now is not a good time to buy condos for investment, especially new launches.

Can 2% gross yield withstand 3 US rate hikes this year?Actually zero yield also can as the price bought for these investors are much lower. Those who bought recently are either for own stay mostly or investors who cleared TDSR and are awaiting en bloc.

Your immediate and all neighbours is one important deciding factor if you want to continue staying in any place.
 
Just generalising here but given that a HDB estate is relatively more congested than a condo estate, with the same % of siao lang distribution in any sample/population, there will be more siao lang in a HDB estate than in a condo who can make your living there hell.
 
I used to have:
1 x pyscho spinster immediate neighbour who luckily don't stay in much - no one can stand her.
1 x girl living a few floors and units away from me who likes to break curfew hours, then father will not let her in and she will be screaming, cursing and shouting in the corridor at 12 midnight.
 
but in that hdb, i also have many nice neighbours who are quiet and keep their areas clean (maybe only my floor).
 
and i have also been to some (new) mass mkt condos and residents think they own everything within, and keep all their shoes, bicycles, laundry etc all outside the corridor, making the whole place an eye sore. the development looks so good on the outside but when i step in, there is dismal.
 
and who can forget the everitt road episode. right?
 
anyway, no matter where you stay (hdb, condo, landed), good considerate neighbours is a must. after that, most other things will hopefully fall in place. and i think we should always aim to be debt free for our primary residence where we can and in the shortest time possible so that we can allocate extra cash to other areas of our lives.
 
I went to my ex colleague new EC, at corner of the town and immediately facing the expressway. 
Cost close to one million.
Combine income maybe $14k.
 
Most neighbours also similar demographics. 
 
It's just feels like HDB with swimming pool & gym, + BBQ stove Function room. 
Cannot imagine opening windows and the loud traffic buzz. 
 
Is this better quality of life? 
Maybe if on air-con for 24 hours.
I think people can go crazy with constant buzzing of 60-70dB
 
Sold his HDB so finances should be manageable. Maybe paying double the current loan amount for 30 yrs.
 
How often one host a party at function room? Going to a restaurant with good food and get a private room is actually better, no worries of clearing up after function too.
 
Security of condo is a joke too, I can only say the deterrence is people distributing leaflets and salesman. 
 
Taking the unit to "improve" quality of life bit still going JB weekly for shopping & petrol. 
 
Not sure if really worth the effort.

So far EC stay 10 years sell, I have not heard of anyone incurring any loss. It's the kind of scared of risk mentality that results in them buying EC as a kind of capital protection. At least new pool and facilities to use 10 years. Anytime can get back a resales HDB. 
But it's indeed scary to think what prices will be like 10 years later.

i missed the boat when i view simei green ec in 2007.  asking price was only 400-450k then.  
 
thinking that EC could be priced cheaply after 5 years, i look to bishan loft ec in 2009 and saw the hefty price tag i think at 1.1m then.  it is indeed scary how prices of ec in good location can appreciate in value.

I went to my ex colleague new EC, at corner of the town and immediately facing the expressway.
 
Cost close to one million.
Combine income maybe $14k.
 
Most neighbours also similar demographics.
 
It's just feels like HDB with swimming pool & gym, + BBQ stove Function room.
Cannot imagine opening windows and the loud traffic buzz.
 
Is this better quality of life?
Maybe if on air-con for 24 hours.
I think people can go crazy with constant buzzing of 60-70dB
 
Sold his HDB so finances should be manageable. Maybe paying double the current loan amount for 30 yrs.
 
How often one host a party at function room? Going to a restaurant with good food and get a private room is actually better, no worries of clearing up after function too.
 
Security of condo is a joke too, I can only say the deterrence is people distributing leaflets and salesman.
 
Taking the unit to "improve" quality of life bit still going JB weekly for shopping & petrol.
 
Not sure if really worth the effort.

 
Sounds like me except :
 
1. I didn't sell HDB so this is my first property ever
2. I don't go JB once a week. Maybe once a quarter?
3. So far no problem with noise even though I face the pool (others complained about laughing and shouting of children but I am okay.)

didn't know they are selling for around $500k+ only. downside is only 10+ years left on the land lease. even if can renew, not sure what will be the price then. that space will be another piece of hotcake.

Can 2% gross yield withstand 3 US rate hikes this year?
 
I would tend to agree with you...  hence the latest loan rates are indeed surprising to me...  
 
OCBC's latest offer works out to 0.7 per cent for the first year, 0.65 per cent for the second year, 0.60 per cent for the third year and 0.55 per cent for the fourth. After that, the rates are 1.55 per cent a year.

There was. It was in the news. Now not sure if withdrawn.
 
4-year lock in for BUC properties.
 
Check with the bank? Most probably will also revise immediately after Fed raise rates.

To me drive up once a year to Melaka & further visit friends and relatives is ok. 
 
To drive weekly to JB is like and ordeal.

Only local banks are able to offer this by taking a view that interest rate will rise and they can adjust their board rates thereafter, they are paying 0.05% or 0.1% on a lot of saving accounts, what is the real spread?  
 
This is offered for properties under construction only, so it makes sense to lock in borrowers and make more money after TOP.

I just refinanced my loan last year to sibor pegged loan. I really hope people who took up the fixed d rate know how many fixed d rates the bank has. 
Example dbs fixed d rate for housing loan is for fixed d between 1000-9999 or whatever amount dbs decides, ie the can change it to 1001. Ultimately the fixed d rate is still a board rate as in the bank can unilaterally increase decrease the rate at any time... 
 
If the bank can take in fixed d at another rate which they have many rates.... u are basically screwed.... cuz the bank has no or little deposits pegged to the rate which housing loans are tied to

then what has JB shopping and petrol have to do with it?He went JB to save on car servicing, petrol, car wash & grocery etc.Bcos he wants to get better value at same dollar. 
 
I meant he is not getting good value for the EC. In the same spirit of getting better value for the dollar he could have chosen another EC, or better siting within the development.
 
He got it hastily bcos it's available then and near his previous HDB.

Thanks for the tips.
 
I am seriously considering Sibor pegged as well after observing for few years.
 
So far my recently refinanced to fixed deposit rates loan has not got any movement for a year. The other one is floating at very low rates less than 1.5%. But I do feel the banks will not offer interest rates anywhere near CPF rates or Singapore Savings Bond rates, so the rate won't deviate too far from there.
 
My best friend in 2015 took a fixed loan at 2.2% against my advice. But the amount was very small IMO so it's not much I suppose.
 
Ultimately interest rate increases will affect all loans. We just need to be prepared - Govt has prepared us well with TDSR.
 

I just refinanced my loan last year to sibor pegged loan. I really hope people who took up the fixed d rate know how many fixed d rates the bank has.
 
Example dbs fixed d rate for housing loan is for fixed d between 1000-9999 or whatever amount dbs decides, ie the can change it to 1001. Ultimately the fixed d rate is still a board rate as in the bank can unilaterally increase decrease the rate at any time... 
 
If the bank can take in fixed d at another rate which they have many rates.... u are basically screwed.... cuz the bank has no or little deposits pegged to the rate which housing loans are tied to

Those are not true fixed rate loans. I would consider them as floating since they can still change according to the underlying instruments.

to me, it does not matter if i am overpaying or underpaying for the house as long as i can afford it but it must be a place i feel comfortable and at peace with...  and i think your friend is willing to pay premium for upgrading but still staying at same location.. hasty likely because that was what he was waiting for in the market, a EC near his place

Very safe if investor with stable income. The higher the income, the more to save if interest is higher. 
1 mil loan for 25 years at 3.5% interest only 5K payment leh... Any median income person can meet it if plan finances carefully.
 
Car full cash and watch full cash was also what you advised right?
 
And if have been paying for almost 10 years since financial crisis amounts will be too small to mention here.
