Look for Alissa Chan from Homeguide. Price might be slightly on the high side but I'm very happy with her services. She did up my current and previous house.
 

Look at the Woodgroove condo project under Residential. That was done by her.

very good follow up. he still calls to ask me about my reno, anything needs to patch etc.. 1 year after my reno is done.
 

and he's the boss of the company, so he can make decisions unlike some other designers who may have to "check with the boss"

I don't get that last line.
 

People here always KPKB about the price - but when they get a cheap deal, they start wondering why the quality is so poor?
 

Cmon - if you want a professional design and quality look and feel - don't scrimp and save that odd $100 or $1000!
 

Would you rather save $10000 and waste another $20000 patching up and redoing etc etc?
 

I goto renotalk and see people want to redo up their entire house for less than $30000???? 
 

It's your house which you will most likely keep for 10+ years...if you think of it like a car - it's a depreciation of 5-10k a year?

there are many ways to work around the budget. 

it doesnt neccessary mean expensive = good
 

some give u el'cheapo A-grade and charge u the price of the real deal.
 

fide is upmarket. thus they are slightly more costly than avg IDs.

All this talk make me feel like doing A & A / reconstruction to my house.
 

Any recommendations?

Perhaps, to open up the front porch and add a roof terrace on the third floor.

Also create airwell and reconfigure back yard.

Rebuild bathrooms and change flooring to hardwood.

What do you all think is a fair budget for a project like this?

Try my ID loh. Contact in previous page. 
 

She did a A&A for a house at Terok Kurau. I visited that house to take a look. Not bad.
 

For mine, nothing major was done. Just did some taiji and shift some walls + the normal essential reno. The only "big item" was removing the tiled roof for the car porch and replacing it with one made of polycarbonate.

Singaporeans are rich. Sometimes I see very simple design & work, but the price.....
 

Most people in other places do not even engage full interior designer, maybe for the Kitchen, & some other things that is pretty hard to DIY. My home also I DIY (but it came with furnished Kitchen & bathroom liao I must say). Key is decorations, some soft toys, decors, & flowers, can liao, classical English style. 
 

But I know Singaporeans like to make their home like Hotel, glossy & alot of sharp edges & flat planes. The one thing I do not want! Save me lots of money too.

If the reno is 200k, then a lot of the money is probably spent on the wet works like flooring, staircase. 
 

I think the reno money is not exactly wasted as if you maintain it, you can sell you house at a higher price later on. My old place fetched a higher price than my neighbours. Some people cash flow not so good or no time to renovate so they rather get a very well renovated place and "include" the reno price in the housing loan....
 

My current place have four bath/toilets but we only use one because there is only me, my wife and our baby girl. The other three toilets is literally brand new.

You can make the whole house & furnish ( I mean full house, 2 story, basement, garage & atire, & garden) for about twice these money in some other countries with much higher labor & material cost. Just saying. 
 

But anyway, there is no need to compare as the market rate is roughly also moderated. They know you LL also as they know Singaporeans cannot say," forget it, I gather some good friends, buy the raw materials & we build ourselves." First, in Singapore, there is no 'ikea' for home building, & even if you really find some good friends to help, no one has a clue how to do it as well! 
 

I would not be surprise most people do not even have a power drill at home. We keep saying our own resources are human, yet we are so lacking in some many basic areas, cannot fix our own car, cannot fix our own house, cannot cook, some cannot even take care of their own kids themselves. Every thing we sub out to other people. 
 

Worst, most of these people are FTs, FWs, as we no longer have these skills anymore. If you gonna rely on others, than you will gonna expect inflated rates as well. But you can say its good for the economy as create more jobs (for FTs FW mainly though) & money goes around more, means more GDP). 
 
 

But without going off topic, I think money seems not a problem for most people here, no way will I even pay anywhere near 200k for renovation (not that I have the money, yap I am one of the few poor fellows here) , but whats 200k when a virtual cert cost over 70k & many people do not think twice to pay. 
 

BTW, is there a warranty for renovation work?

ok thanks for input,  did not want a bath tub cos space not very big . so if take away tub, the toilet looks bigger.
 
plus the design in the bed room is more important...... 
 
 
but that would be later, now wants to settle bath room, follow by living room, kitchen, guess room, study room then bed room.

1. timeless, warm color, expensive material, need to be careful on porous marble 
2. rough surface of material, very rustic and back to nature feel
3. sleek design, cold color, potential rust on metal surface
4. modern, clean and neat detail, minimum maintenance
5. elaborate, classic, more effort to maintain.

IMHO, practicality is most important.....try not to have cabinets inside the bathroom. Make it simple. A well maintained glass screen is nice to look at & useful.....dirty & stained ones is a total turn off if you intend to 鸳鸯戏水。Of course if you have someone to maintain it, I see #3 is nice...you can brush your teeth & see your gal dancing inside...

This is the guest  toilet. As you can see the colour.....damn cannot make it.
 
 
Anyway. Thanks all for the contributions. 
 
 
Even jman888. Let me settle my house then i cum disturb  you 😆😆😅
 
 
Just one question to ask,  they said that its granite so hacking will be quite costly.  Anyone got experience on the price for hacking?

what i know, they all use power tool to do it.... so regardless whatever the hard material is, its should cost the same :) unless the one which requires no power tool... like wall paper or laminate floor...:)

What's bb?
 
But I am not keen on white as the colour theme. Black mould is a bugbear of every bathroom... 
 
Regrouting is a bitch. White become off white also over time also another issue.

guess the first one would be much more ex due to material used. Marble or granite? Maybe as iras they would have a better idea..
 
i like the clean look of the latter.

When i bought from GC, 22G copper tubing is standard. To upgrade from 3/8" to 1/2" armaflex insulator costs $100-150. 
 
Don't compromise on either. It's a way to prevent common problems like "sweating" of aircon trunking and reduce chance of problems with the installation.

He's chopping your carrot.
Ask your ID to recommend a AC installer. He should know a few.
 
Usually for condos, they just charge a flat rate to dig up or test the pipes if still working. From what I'm aware.

Condo concealed piping may also cost more.
