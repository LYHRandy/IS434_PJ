Can be done for sure, the steps are very easy, everything is listed on hdb website
 
Selling - impt thing is to complete the seller's checklist 
 
Buying - complete the buyer's checklist 
 
Infact, i think it is easier to transact without agent

You can sell by yourself. Just follow HDB rules.
Checkout their website for guidance.
Otherwise, how do you think agent sell/buy ?
 
I bought/sell my hdb myself.
 
You need to arrange with the other party to meet up at HDB HQ and queue up with those smug property agents.
 
Last time I had a quarrel with one such a-hole at the queue.

you only need agent only when you need them to do the leg work in search of your ideal home. If you are already fixed on what, where to get, just ownself print out checklist and ownself check the boxes.

It's bcuz people are lazy to do their own legwork, that's how property agents are around.
 
Think about the typical $5k ~ $20k they are earning, for just the same work you can do. Unless your time cost more than that, then you let them do.
 
If it's your one month salary, think about the holidays you just lost.

I find not much difference really, selling hdb via agent, they also sit with you to complete the seller's checklist even more troublesome than just filling the seller checklist ourselves online
 
Selling maybe better to get agent to filter calls 
 
Buying i would say diy is the best

On selling part.... if I post property for sale online, then agent call me up and say he got someone looking for this area, I still need to pay him agent fee right? unless its the buyer call me directly....
 
on buying part, most of the ads are placed by agent, how do I look for a unit without agent, then?

No tell the agent he represent them n he will do the paper work for u for free else you won't let him view. 
 
The second one you can undercut the agent but not so nice as some owners let one agent sell. That one you represent yourself n the agent will help the owner.

agent can only represent one party.
 
hence for selling, if you are advertising on your own and can settle your own paper work, you do not need to pay agent fee. 
 
for buying, you can look for ads posted by agents. Just let them know upfront you are not paying any agent fee. This case, the agent is representing the seller.

I think otherwise. For transaction like these or buying used cars, I would not go through relatives or friends. I treasure relationship more if there is any cock up during the process. Imagine your friend bought you viewed a few places but you never offer....then you come across a good deal & close with another agent for a place you like. Very paiseh to the friend....or you bought a lemon car through relatives.....Pai Gao Dai

It's a long time ago since I bought my flat.
 
When you post a property for sale, most likely 90% of callers are property agents looking to sell for you. Since you already paid for the advert, you should tell them off and you insist you do not deal with agents. Otherwise, agent just re-advert again (of cuz when they paid for the advert, they want your money) to look for buyer.
 
If they insist they have a buyer for you, then make it clear you will not pay them a single cent. The agent should only collect commission from buyer.
 
The buying part through advert is probably more challenging, since again, probably about 90% of those advertised are from agents. I believe they only collect commission from those sellers.
 
If you want to bypass agents totally, it's difficult but not impossible, unless you have direct contact to interested buyers and sellers.
 
Remember agents are after your money. If they sense a "bypassing" by either buyer or seller, they get very pissed.

I bought my new house without engage agent and sold my current house via agent.
 
Initially I wanted to save some moolahlike you but the problem is the viewer was low for 2 weeks when i listed on eg. gumtrxx, and some other website. 
 
In the end, 2 agents saw my listing and asked me whether is it ok for her to market my unit. I told her that my com was 1.5% of the transaction price (without exclusive) and she is ok with it. Within 1 month, I had sold my unit.
 
I felt that it is possible to sell the unit myself if i was able to post on the most common website eg. propguru, srx or iprop. (This website are only exclusive to Agent only)

unfortunately, the popular websites where most buyers browse are propguru and srx, which is designed for agents.
 
one way is to ask agent friends to advertise for u for free, just use their credits
 
if by some amazing odds u do not know any agent personally, can email a few and see who is willing to sell u his website credits. Maybe for $100 or so. Most agents would say no. sometimes a good hearted one may just agree,

Yes you may do so without hiring an agent. it would be strongly encourage to do so unless one is familiarize with the procedures and paper work or having the assistance by someone especially in HDB transaction. if you are a purchaser for a house, the seller may need to buy another house and here is the complex part where we need to be careful and need to coordinate the timing carefully due to the loan and CPF issues;  vice versa you may need to sell also before buying. sometime a party maybe doing contra case  (simple layman terms: handing over old house and taking over new house at the same day)
 
it may seem to be an easy job but is always good to seek clarification and assistance if need to. lastly being an agent may seem to be an easy job, but actually there is a lot of ground works need to be done for our clients; coordinate viewings (filtering those open listing units in case is a duplicate unit marketed by different agts), qualifying eligibility to buy and sell, running errands for our clients and assisting in their financing and legal paper work document etc. lastly good property agents put in their time and efforts and provide expertise and values to their clients.  just my two cents worth opinion :)

HDB transactions are quite easy to follow. If in any doubt just email or call HDB to clarify. I find the HDB officers are knowledgeable enough to guide a buyer/ seller. I have sold and bought my own HDB before without any agent assisting.
 
Also, some agents claim that if you sell on your own, it will take much longer, or u will get lower price etc
 
I sold my own flat during bear market within 1 week when agents are taking 6 months to sell. And I sold it at $20k COV when agents are advising sellers to sell below COV.
 
it is all about being realistic and presenting your flat nicely. If u want more tips, PM me. happy to advice (for free!)

if you have time in your hands, i.e. your work hours are flexible then u should definitely do purchase/sale on your own.
To engage agents, for purchase need to pay 1% and selling need to pay 2%. Agents are good as they do all the work (provided you are really busy and its difficult to take leave and etc). At the same time, some agents despite doing the required work they will hardly answer ur calls and queries on time (my friend kena recently after paying 11K for contra). So if you have time, its cheaper to do it on your own.
 
Go and check the HDB website, everything information is there and its quite straight forward.
 
Cheers!

The agent fee is bargainable? I thought is by default 2% and 1% for seller and buyer respectively?
 
And if you advertised on your own, how do you make agreement with agent to say that you will not be paying agent fee? it is by default that agent fee need to be pay, so if anything out of this convention method need to have black and white right? else after the transaction the agent might come after you for the fee.....

Buying new cars or houses that come with warranty I think can let own people earn.
 
But secondhand goods I think no too cos the risks to relationships too high. Insurance is not preferred too in my opinion because there are always clauses that we do not read.
 
 
I think otherwise. For transaction like these or buying used cars, I would not go through relatives or friends. I treasure relationship more if there is any cock up during the process.

Before i let the agent market my unit, I had told her that my com to her is 1.5% base on transacted price and without exclusive. She was ok with the arrangement and therefore. There isn't any forms to sign except Option to purchase.
 
1 point to note: Make sure that your buyer had applied for HLE and can loan up to the amount you are selling, otherwise you will need to find another buyer which is you might lose out on the opportunity cost.
 
Of course there will some people just want to buy a house near your area and see your house lay out or what so ever.

hi Bluepica, agency service fee is negotiable and no fixed rate in the market. if the seller or the buyer accepted the agency service fee, there will be an agreement form signed by all parties.
