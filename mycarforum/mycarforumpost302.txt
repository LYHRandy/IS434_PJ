I was at AMK central yesterday and decided to drop by this Centrio Residences showroom to look see look see while waiting for my gal to finish her class. I was shocked when i was told 80+ out of the 104 units on the phase 1 launch was snapped out just over the past 5 days. The price is over 1100+ psf, 2 bedroom unit cost about 1 mil while a 3 bedroom unit cost 1.3 mil onwards. So far most buyers are local and majority are HDB upgraders. There is only a few units of 2 bedroom units left and the floor area is pathetic 80 sq meter which is about the size of 3 room HDB. Unbelievable to see ppl paying 1 mil for such a small unit and is only 99 yrs lease term. I can only say many Sporeans are rich.

truth be told, a friend of mine who has been a property agent for more than ten years, told me that singapore has many cash rich people who buy properties with cash full payment, and they just hold and wait to sell it for profit.
 

another friend of mine who works in a local bank, tells me the same. she says many many bank accounts have millions of dollars.

This project made to the news headline as the most expensive 99 yrs condo in heartland area. Far East bought the land at 600+psf and with overheads and building cost it become 1000 psf. They can't sell it lower than that. I am going to see how Far East manage to get rid of all the units. In this period of condo fever, i think it is not difficult to find 300 suckers.

Hi bro, the reason why it seems like it is snapped out so fast because they had a launch a week earlier for VVIP. It is only for those who have made an appointment with the agent and present a blank cheque upon visiting. Motive of blank cheque: to show interest before they would serve you.. what the....
 

most of the 2 rooms are already booked, meaning the buyer passed the black cheque to the agent. hence when it is fully launched to the public, all those who have booked are given priority.
 

i guess the location of the Centro makes it a perfect for investment, just across the road to the mrt. but i dislike the fact that they catered 20% less parking lots for the residents. i really wonder what if they face shortage of lots?? book a lot at amk hub for the resident?? lol
 

btw the maintainence monthly if not wrong is abt 300+ and you have to add another 100 if you are getting the parking lot..

Eff-Yee-Oh famous for   .... and yet it never fail to amaze me how come there are still people willing to kena chop carrot.... And I hardly find anyone that actually made a killing buying their properties... 
 

Anyway their pockets very deep one lah.... They can take forever to slowly launch, re-launch, re-re-launch and there have no urgency to get rid of all their units.

I somehow agrees.
 

1100+ psf, I would be in Novena area with a freehold unit
 

There can be 2 schemes or more:
 

Standard scheme 5%+15%(2 weeks later) comes with bank loan (must fullfil min 70k in CPF)
 

or 
 

defer payment scheme, just need to pay 1% without bank loan, b4 TOP got to look for a loan and top the balance.

Good location i agree, but the noise pollution is one big factor to consider with above ground MRT and bus interchange next to it. Imagine facing the noise everyday from 5.30am to 12mn. My parent's flat in Yishun is next to MRT and near main roads so i know every morning when i heard MRT sound and bus engine and braking noise, it is 5.30am liao.

this is so typical of Far East.  Look at Rafflesia opposite RJC in Bishan.  Still have empty units after 6, 7 years.  
 

Not sure if those that bought know how to do their sums.  How much rental they need to get to cover their monthly mortgage?  With that kind of expected rental that they will have to ask, what other choices do tenants have in other more convenient location.
 

but then again, let these suckers buy....then my valuation of my place will go up....

I don't think there is such thing as 1% without bank loan until TOP. If it is, then it must be some sort of hanky panky.
 

I mean what if the buyer not qualified for bank loan? And the developer so stupid to "reserve" the unit for him until TOP only to realise he is not qualified for the loan?
 

If like that,.  then even student can "buy" a 1 million condo. He just need to get $10k from his dad.
 

And I would be buying a few 1 million condo this weekend. Never mind if I doesn't qualified for loan since no bank loan is needed.

i really wanna laugh when reading today's papers that got developers say it's not bubble forming but blister.. -said so that the horse will not scare away their potential suckers!

the hot property mkt really got to thank the 'KS' mentality of Sporeans.. die die must buy so as not to lose out to others! 
 

today morning show got interviewed one property consultant who said he knew someone who earns 6k but buy 1 million house! This guy really must pray that he can keeps his job, the property prices dun drop, the banks dun increase their rates, and always got tenant. any one of these factors kicks in and he's ho seh liao!

E.g. Parc Sophia 1%+9%, TOP then get bank loan of 80% than +5%.
 

Bank don't undertake, developer will undertake the contract.
 

That's why a lot of people got burn when prices came down. There is a recent story on this near to Shangrila area forget what name but a China immigrant block book 10 or 20units and got burn 40% for each unit.
 

Defer scheme is also known as interest absolution scheme.
 
 




I don't think there is such thing as 1% without bank loan until TOP. If it is, then it must be some sort of hanky panky.
 

I mean what if the buyer not qualified for bank loan? And the developer so stupid to "reserve" the unit for him until TOP only to realise he is not qualified for the loan?
 

If like that,.  then even student can "buy" a 1 million condo. He just need to get $10k from his dad.
 

And I would be buying a few 1 million condo this weekend. Never mind if I doesn't qualified for loan since no bank loan is needed.

Next downturn? What makes you so sure that we are recovering from the current downturn, although the media keep showing news that Asia is having a  V recovery :)

I'm no financial guru, but looking at the current global situation, there's a high possibility that the recovery would be W shaped, hence after some signs of recovery, the economy will move downwards again.

$1100++ psf can land you a unit at Rivergate in River Valley. Not that its a very nicely designed development but still its in RV and that means something at least.
 

Paying this price for a c**p (you fill in the blanks) development from a c**p developer is just.... Wonder what these people are thinking.

to some it is good because hawker centre, market, amk hub and shops is just next door.

For those who prefer a little more peace and quiet, this devt is not for them.



 

I think MRT noise issue is not significant, I have friends who stay at some condo near MRT.

To my surprize the noise was quite minimum.
 

But I think Bus exhaust and  noise may be a bit of problem. 

Generally speaking. Condo near MRT will be good for the family member who are not driving.
 

For Condo near MRT, I think better choice will be those not at the centre of the  Hub.

e.g Tanah Merah, Kambagan and one more at the west. They are convenient but yet not too far from HUB.
 

BTW, Singapore is very small (size I mean, it is big in some other way), 

I think no where in Singapore is far by international standard.

I use to drive 40 minutes to work on expressway when working oversea.
 

At some city, the middle upper class actually prefer to stay away from the city. 
 

The really rich will have one villa outside the city and one apartment in the city, plus many many more.
 

But on the whole, we must all be grateful that most people  here have a roof over their head.

To be able to pick, choose and complain is a blessing from heaven....... 
 

Go to some third world country and see how lucky we are.
 

Just my opinion

I can only say that come 2012/2013, these people would have wished they have never bought.
 

property prices will be so depressed by then that nobody even wants to talk about it.



 

yup... wait for the bubble to burst... then that's when the real bargain hunting begins... please, oh please... more people to the slaughterhouse showroom... so there will be more choices when the bubble bursts and hopefully government don't step in and control...

like what the rest of the bro/sis here said, its status... y are there people getting a BMW 735 where a 325 will also do the job. Do we really need the additional 1000cc capacity? How fast can you travel in SG? for the bigger space? then a cheap Korean MPV would be a better choice tha a 735. But then, why people go for a 7 series?

Interest rates have been squeezed so low that people are 'encouraged' to spend money, be it property or equities as a hedge against inflation. Just pure desperation to spend money first for fear of inflation eating it away slowly. Prices rise as long as there's another sucker willing to pay more. But it's like playing musical chairs, you don't want to be the last one holding the bag when the bubble bursts. Which was exactly what happened to many a year or so before.
 

Two years ago or so, I was on a bus. I group of ah-pek retiree types were talking loudly amoungst themselves, boasting how 5, 6 digit profits can be made by flipping condos. Where the hottest units were, etc. Those were the days where you read in the news of long long queues for property launches.
 

These are the times you want to be very careful, you know the bubble is about to burst, and it did. Well, those days are back again. The interesting difference this time is prices are up not because of genuine reasons such as a good economy, but 'cheap' money/credit flooding the market.

$1100++ psf can land you a unit at Rivergate in River Valley. Not that its a very nicely designed development but still its in RV and that means something at least.
 

Paying this price for a c**p (you fill in the blanks) development from a c**p developer is just.... Wonder what these people are thinking.



 

Exactly, i also wonder what those ppl are thinking. Imagine several years later that they tell their friends that they bought their house during recession period and pay >1mil for a 99 yrs condo, worse have to queue up to throw cheques.

I used to ask this same question too...whats the big deal about 99 yrs condo? Why do people even bother to consider let alone buy one.
 

Today I am staying in a 99 yrs condo...115 sq m(3+1)...and if someone were to ask me this crazy again...i guess my answer is simple.
 

1.  My wife and I don't qualify for new HDB and looking at the price of resale HDB, its just not 'worth' it.  The price differences between my place and a HDB EM is round +- 100k...so the gap is not that wide anymore.  And I am buying to stay and not for investment.

2.  The security that comes with staying in a condo (you may say its perceived security but even that is better than nothing).

3.  The facilities...yeah some of you may think it's overrated but a condo with full facilities can make a lot of differences in one's daily life.  A pool big enough that I can't swim across holding one breath...proper tennis courts...function rooms and BBQ area. It makes a difference actually.  When I am really tired from work, i can just pop down for a swim.

4.  I always get a parking lot.
 

Enough said, I don't really care about the so-called 'pride' to stay in private property.  Hehe heck..its a 99 yrs property...but the convenience it bring to me and my wife...and for my kid next time...it's something that can't be measured by $$$ alone.  This is from someone that has stayed in HDB for over 30 yrs.
 
 

Just my take on this.

A friend in construction once told me these developers get their friends to bring dud cheques to book units during launches. After that they announce a large amount sold during launch to generate interest. Once buyers start to bite, those units initially booked with dud cheques are slowly released again back on sale.

Agree.
 

Owning a 7-series or an S-Class is considered a status symbol - e.g. at business meetings, black-tie dinners, gala ball etc.
 

If you want status symbol properties, get the GCBs in D.10, or up-scale prime apartments in D.9/10 from Nassim, Ladyhill, Scotts, Stevens, Grange, Tanglin areas.
 

Owning a 99-yr leasehold, 2/3-roomer, especially in non-prime-district (i.e. outside of D.9/10), outskirts AMK, is definitely not anywhere near any status symbol, by any measure.

Is this true? I really suspect this is such the case. The centro pricing is so OUT of whack that I find it really hard to believe there are 80 people who will actually buy it....

That's a very good truthful answer. There are some perks in living in a Condo, comparing to the run of the mill HDB. The facilities, the quality of fit, even the layouts are also better.
 

Now I'm staying in an EA in Punggol, which supposedly is not that bad. But if one look closely, there are areas which still suck. The carpark is very dirty, the children playground is vandalized, the lift smells, and there's dog poop every here and there, so we gotta be very careful where we walk. 
 

Comparing the difference in maintainance fees we pay, you get more value staying in a Condo.

Hi bro, the reason why it seems like it is snapped out so fast because they had a launch a week earlier for VVIP. It is only for those who have made an appointment with the agent and present a blank cheque upon visiting. Motive of blank cheque: to show interest before they would serve you.. what the....
 

most of the 2 rooms are already booked, meaning the buyer passed the black cheque to the agent. hence when it is fully launched to the public, all those who have booked are given priority.
 

i guess the location of the Centro makes it a perfect for investment, just across the road to the mrt. but i dislike the fact that they catered 20% less parking lots for the residents. i really wonder what if they face shortage of lots?? book a lot at amk hub for the resident?? lol
 

btw the maintainence monthly if not wrong is abt 300+ and you have to add another 100 if you are getting the parking lot..



 
 

crazy. my fren condo at yishun, 4 room. maintenance 280/per month include 2 parking lot.

you remind me of a boss i met before saying driving in singapore is not worth at all, yet he still drive his S-Class here and there. so what it implies?

Some say this is a property bubble which will burst soon. Others who say it's just a "glorified" pigeon hole, and anyway it's only 99 years lease. Some others would say a 3 rm HDB flat provide the same roof over the head as a condo anyway, why blow money on such things? Anyway some condo units are even smaller than their 4NG HDB pigeon hole. It's like saying the rest of the people who stay in their HDB pigeon holes are smarter that idiots who queue up for days to book a condo, that they know somethings that people who buys condo don't.
 

It's not that there's no merit in what these people say. People have a lot of their own reasons to prefer and aspire to live in a condo, just as there are people who are so darned rich, yet prefer to stay in a "lowly" 3 room HDB pigeon hole.
 

My view is, if can afford to, why not? What's the point of making so much money and yet not living it up, getting slightly better things in life? What's the motive in commenting about people who buys condo as if these people are fools? Sounds a lot like sour grapes to me.

i second that. when ppl talk about other's luxury expenditure, they will become financial guru and comment this comment that. every one started to say they know rich ppl that never take luxury thing and prefer normal thing (same as what they have) and said that how smart this kind of ppl are, blah blah blah. 

in my mind, i always think that they all these financial smart guru are so smart, they should be very very rich liao (cause they know how to use $$ to make $$ rather than those rich ppl just throw $$ to buy those luxuries).  too bad, i have yet to meet someone that are truly rich and dont buy luxury stuff. 

may be Mr. Li is a dumb person that put $$20mils to buy a house in Singapore. giving the smart guru to use that $20mils, they should make how many mils liao..

Generally higher means valuation also higher. And near MRT means higher valuation. For resale this can only be a good thing right?

i have the same thought as in why people will want to spend $$ buying the 99 yrs condo for more than 1mil...
 

i won't call them silly but i really wanna know why a i am looking at condo now, comparing the prices..
 

just like my friend who bought a hse in toa payoh, a HDB. resale one, cost 500K plus.. they never go check out prices, never plan at all. last min rush here and there to submit docs for loan.. everything last min and dun think one..
 

and lastly, i am the one who started the silversea CONDON... not sure anyone remember.. haha

What you say reminds me of the thread comparing Kia Forte with other makes recently...seems like the initial craze is fading already....

Anyway I believe buyers (either cars or houses) do have their reason for their decision. We should not judge them based on our perspective.

my monthly is $260, with 3 carpark lots thrown in.  so i save $180 /mth on carparks compared to hdb since i got 2 cars.  i save on town council etc.  in the end, i pay slightly more compared to hdb but i get all the condo facilities.  of course it is different if i dun have any car...
 

but most importantly, i feel it is much safer for my kids when we are living in condo compared to hdb.

I was at AMK central yesterday and decided to drop by this Centrio Residences showroom to look see look see while waiting for my gal to finish her class. I was shocked when i was told 80+ out of the 104 units on the phase 1 launch was snapped out just over the past 5 days. The price is over 1100+ psf, 2 bedroom unit cost about 1 mil while a 3 bedroom unit cost 1.3 mil onwards. So far most buyers are local and majority are HDB upgraders. There is only a few units of 2 bedroom units left and the floor area is pathetic 80 sq meter which is about the size of 3 room HDB. Unbelievable to see ppl paying 1 mil for such a small unit and is only 99 yrs lease term. I can only say many Sporeans are rich.



 

My colleague just sold his HDB flat and bought a condo.....reason being living in condo don't have to worry about Ah Long splashing paint as there is security.... 
 

So those who live in condo can go ahead and borrow from Ah Long liao ????

Not sure if can siam ah long but if its for a sense of security, i agree.
 

i am now waiting for the right time to buy a condo and the reason why i am buying one is due to security. Nowadays, more and more foreign imports and everytime when i open the papers, always see robbery and etc... not saying that staying in condo is safe from robbery but at least there is a guard and i dun have to worry about my wife or daughter coming back home late from taxi... 
 

my car kena paint droplets when HDB renovate my HDB flat... not just once but 3 times!!! town council not able to help, contractor siam my calls and sms...  downstair always got a gang of rascals making noises and disturbing pple at night... !! i have enuff of all these s--t... paying so much for a HDB to get these!

This project made to the news headline as the most expensive 99 yrs condo in heartland area. Far East bought the land at 600+psf and with overheads and building cost it become 1000 psf. They can't sell it lower than that. I am going to see how Far East manage to get rid of all the units. In this period of condo fever, i think it is not difficult to find 300 suckers.




living near MRT, AMK hub, nature parks....

1) Will millionaire buyers take MRT and forego cars? If not, why bother to buy million-dollar

    small units next to MRT?

2) AMK hub is not as glamourous to shop, no Prada, Club 21, Bread & Butter...

    will millionaires shop there? Can they live with AMK heartlanders?

3) nature parks? where?? the parks are not natural (man-made).
 

If for investment...can they rent out more than $4k per month of return, competing

with rental from AMK HDB below $2k.
 

funny buyers.

Not sure if can siam ah long but if its for a sense of security, i agree.
 

i am now waiting for the right time to buy a condo and the reason why i am buying one is due to security. Nowadays, more and more foreign imports and everytime when i open the papers, always see robbery and etc... not saying that staying in condo is safe from robbery but at least there is a guard and i dun have to worry about my wife or daughter coming back home late from taxi...



 

These are the reasons for me to wait for the opportunity to buy too , not because of a class higher than HDB or to enjoy the condo facilities.

my monthly is $260, with 3 carpark lots thrown in.  so i save $180 /mth on carparks compared to hdb since i got 2 cars.  i save on town council etc.  in the end, i pay slightly more compared to hdb but i get all the condo facilities.  of course it is different if i dun have any car...
 

but most importantly, i feel it is much safer for my kids when we are living in condo compared to hdb.




hmmm...saving car park cost, how much more did you pay for your EC?

seems like you are staying in a large estate, paying just $260/mth.

kids fatality happened in condo..swimming pool, get real

Actually, the traffic around the AMK hub is quite terrible at times. I will only consider to buy this condo (put pricing aside) if I take public transport and don't drive at all. Don't want to get stucked in the traffic even when about to reach home!

i think nowadays condo is just like another HDB estate but just that it comes with the extra security that a lot of us are looking for..
 

i work the night shift and i was told by at least 3 female colleagues of mine who kena from molest in the middle of night when they went home..
 

1 stay at bukit batok, 1 serangoon and another one in some north area.. they all kena followed when they align the taxi just underneath their block... 
 

Sad to say, singapore is not getting safe anymore. there is always a risk of crime everywhere but if i can do a bit more as a prevention to my family, why not..

Next downturn? What makes you so sure that we are recovering from the current downturn, although the media keep showing news that Asia is having a  V recovery :)

I'm no financial guru, but looking at the current global situation, there's a high possibility that the recovery would be W shaped, hence after some signs of recovery, the economy will move downwards again.



 

Wah bro u r good lei...just watch the 10pm news they mention we are likely into a W shape recovery...

Many are still safe, as long as they don't commit those above $1,000 psf in HDB areas.
 

Condos pricing are always supported by HDB pricing. 
 

Some owners might willing to take the gamble. For instance 

- 3-bedrm condo at 800K. Top another few years time (can start save more $).

- 3 bedrom condo at 800K resale.

 - Whether you take NPS or IAS, it's the same. 

- 20% is like 160K exclude stamp duty. 5% cash & the rest can use CPF. Not a big problem to many.
 
 

What if one party is out of job or die die must sell and they sell at 100K lost. They can take it as rental they paid for the years they stay. 
 

And they can downgrade to hdb. If they sell low, they will buy low for the HDB. 
 

Some got back ups from parents. Worst case, stay with in-laws, parents..

I used to ask this same question too...whats the big deal about 99 yrs condo? Why do people even bother to consider let alone buy one.
 

Today I am staying in a 99 yrs condo...115 sq m(3+1)...and if someone were to ask me this crazy again...i guess my answer is simple.
 

1.  My wife and I don't qualify for new HDB and looking at the price of resale HDB, its just not 'worth' it.  The price differences between my place and a HDB EM is round +- 100k...so the gap is not that wide anymore.  And I am buying to stay and not for investment.

2.  The security that comes with staying in a condo (you may say its perceived security but even that is better than nothing).

3.  The facilities...yeah some of you may think it's overrated but a condo with full facilities can make a lot of differences in one's daily life.  A pool big enough that I can't swim across holding one breath...proper tennis courts...function rooms and BBQ area. It makes a difference actually.  When I am really tired from work, i can just pop down for a swim.

4.  I always get a parking lot.
 

Enough said, I don't really care about the so-called 'pride' to stay in private property.  Hehe heck..its a 99 yrs property...but the convenience it bring to me and my wife...and for my kid next time...it's something that can't be measured by $$$ alone.  This is from someone that has stayed in HDB for over 30 yrs.
 
 

Just my take on this.



 

your case sounds familiar.

let us see the real case study in Jan'08

I was at AMK central yesterday and decided to drop by this Centrio Residences showroom to look see look see while waiting for my gal to finish her class. I was shocked when i was told 80+ out of the 104 units on the phase 1 launch was snapped out just over the past 5 days. The price is over 1100+ psf, 2 bedroom unit cost about 1 mil while a 3 bedroom unit cost 1.3 mil onwards. So far most buyers are local and majority are HDB upgraders. There is only a few units of 2 bedroom units left and the floor area is pathetic 80 sq meter which is about the size of 3 room HDB. Unbelievable to see ppl paying 1 mil for such a small unit and is only 99 yrs lease term. I can only say many Sporeans are rich.



 

Sometimes I don't get why people want to buy a tiny condo that's smaller than a 4-room with ceilings so low that you bump your head if you hop. I've been to so many and allow me to say, no thank you.
 

I find that a good majority buyers of these condos simply want a condo for its namesake. So they can "I stay in a condo". I know a few whose main reason for buying a tiny condo is "because I don't want to stay in HDB with that kind of people". Just incase, people who buy a big spacious condo - assuming they're not digging a huge credit hole for themselves - are not the ones I'm referring to. 
 

I'd wait to be able to afford something bigger and more spacious. But who am I to say anything anyway. I'll hug my money and watch these people from the sidelines.

i stayed near AMK town centre for over 20 plus yrs .. seen the transformation of the town centre from bustling to boring and then to bustling again..from fountain to emporium oriental to AMK hub.. 
 

eversince the AMK hub been opened, the roads beside it are always crowded.. esp so on weekends. But then it's town centre so must be crowded. For those living there or nearby, convenience is plus,but the noise and pollution is minus. cannot have best of both worlds.

Some say this is a property bubble which will burst soon. Others who say it's just a "glorified" pigeon hole, and anyway it's only 99 years lease. Some others would say a 3 rm HDB flat provide the same roof over the head as a condo anyway, why blow money on such things? Anyway some condo units are even smaller than their 4NG HDB pigeon hole. It's like saying the rest of the people who stay in their HDB pigeon holes are smarter that idiots who queue up for days to book a condo, that they know somethings that people who buys condo don't.
 

It's not that there's no merit in what these people say. People have a lot of their own reasons to prefer and aspire to live in a condo, just as there are people who are so darned rich, yet prefer to stay in a "lowly" 3 room HDB pigeon hole.
 

My view is, if can afford to, why not? What's the point of making so much money and yet not living it up, getting slightly better things in life? What's the motive in commenting about people who buys condo as if these people are fools? Sounds a lot like sour grapes to me.



 

To summarise your post, it is matter of preference and choice. Some people think is worth it, some dont. Some people just buy for the sake of investing, some buy to stay. All of us have different reasons for buying a condo, or not buying. But what I would like to say is, buy within your means. If you can afford, and you wants to, then go ahead. If cant afford, stick to what you have for the time being.

But with an 'elitist' view like that, then the true Singaporean elites can also say "I don't want to stay in outskirts condos, especially those 99-yr lease ones, and mix around with that kind of HDB upgrader people".  So all of them will cocoon themselve in their super-prime D9/10 enclaves.

Can you imagine having the MRT screeching sound every 2 to 3 mins everyday? 

Just stand across the road and hear it yourself. And sound travels upwards.   [shakehead]  
 
 




i guess the location of the Centro makes it a perfect for investment, just across the road to the mrt. but i dislike the fact that they catered 20% less parking lots for the residents. i really wonder what if they face shortage of lots?? book a lot at amk hub for the resident?? lol
 

btw the maintainence monthly if not wrong is abt 300+ and you have to add another 100 if you are getting the parking lot..

Good location i agree, but the noise pollution is one big factor to consider with above ground MRT and bus interchange next to it. Imagine facing the noise everyday from 5.30am to 12mn. My parent's flat in Yishun is next to MRT and near main roads so i know every morning when i heard MRT sound and bus engine and braking noise, it is 5.30am liao.

No lah, they purposely jack up the psf one.

They have early bird discount - 12%

If your parents stay in AMK area - another 10%.
 

If you think with your little head, sure "gian" one. 1M for a pigeon hole? Thanks, but no thanks.
 
 
 




I think the developer is not being truthful.
 

Seriously, u guys think got people buy AMK 99 year condo at 1100 psf???? 
 

I only believe when developer says the entire place is sold out. Which was the case when the property market was really hot. If really got buyers, it will be sold OUT. not err 80% sold, u can still buy but must hurry...

The stamp duties they earned from these madness is  

If the same properties kenna flip 3 times, that's 3 times the stamp duties into the coffer.
 
 
 




Developer Option To Purchase cannot assign to others. Therefore, buyer who proceed must pay the stamp duty first, then can resell.

Now HDBs have playground & small parks. Condos have slightly more, swimming pool, 

gym, and a security guard. 

i rather save thousands of $$$, by just 

a) accepting ppl calling me a HDB dweller,  

b) swim in public pools (at my choice), paying $1.30/entry, supervise with life guards;

c) getting a normal gym at $100/month,

d) get better locks for my doors.
 

most of all, i sleep better without worry about heavy debt burden.

Gahmen is capitilising on our obsession of being of a higher social status than others thru owning a condo.
 

With greater income disparity and an unlimited influx of cheap foreign trash, the social strata have increased many layers more. The feeling of being upper-class is therefore more apparent.
 

End of the day, it's merely a "feel-good" feeling living in a pigeon hole. After a while the novelty will wear off and a search for a newer pigeon hole will take place.
 

And gahmen making tons of money from every stage of the transaction.....

The problem with us is that we let our hearts rule over our heads. And herd mentality is so prevalent. If everyone is a rapist, then no one will feel that rape is wrong since everyone's doing it.
 

There's a reason why Li-Ao comments on the stupidity of Singaporeans. From an outsider's perspective it's very easy to see why.

yew tee. public transport not convenient right? The MRT has no direct line to the city. If u drive.... although the distance is small, the time can be long (all city traffic). I don't know about yew tee but what matters most to people is how long u take to get to a place, not how far.

come' on, do you think singapore is a continent? it is a small tiny island, and

we have efficient public transport. 

Singapore is only 680km2 (our neighbour Truly asia is 320,000km2, where cars

are really needed.)



 

if you are working in shenton way/RP/tanjong pajar etc,
 

try the morning and evening trafffic every single day.  
 

if given the choice, i believe most will prefer to live in tiong bahru, havelock, rivervalley etc.

interestingly, australia IS a continent, and yet they have more control over their ppty market (esp. on foreigner buying) than singapore...

Why control the property market?

This is a willing buyer willing seller situation, and does not involve subsidised housing.

most of all, i sleep better without worry about heavy debt burden.
 

Freedom is happiness.



 

Yes fully agree.
 

Inner peace, free of burdens.
 

vs
 

Huge loan.

Worry every month, at each pay day, to ensure sufficient funds for all bills

Dig deeper and deeper into overdrafts and short-term bank loans to repay loans!

These are the reasons for me to wait for the opportunity to buy too , not because of a class higher than HDB or to enjoy the condo facilities.



 

I wander if there is any statistics from police that says private property has lower incidence of criminal activity vs public ones.
 

Or is there a same perception that grew out of ignorance or unsubstantiated fears?
 

If the above is real, shouldn't private house owners and their loves ones be staying within their compounds and only to venture outside to those dangerous world of HDB and criminal-infested dwellers in their 2 or more vehicles?
 

I fear that the above perception and biased attitude will fuel the ever growing so-called Rich & Poor divide.
 

Don't get me wrong, I know private owners are not all snobbish nor or "elitish" in their true nature.
 

But if one wants to reside in condos based on security reason, I think they should only look at those landed-properties who experienced frequent break-ins, the need for guard dogs and security cameras.
 

I even commemted my rich friend being a dog-lover in having 3 German Shepherds and only to have him looking at me sternly saying:
 

"My house had 3 breakings since Jan 2008 and none had any follow up from the police.

my condo maint fees is only $150/mth ! I have a car & a bike.

If I were to stay in a HDB, I would have paid: $60(conservency)

Besides parking, I also enjoy the free facilities like: security guard,swimming pool,gym,tennis court,hot bath,free shutter bus, ect... does it make more sense staying in a condo?

That's a very good truthful answer. There are some perks in living in a Condo, comparing to the run of the mill HDB. The facilities, the quality of fit, even the layouts are also better.
 

Now I'm staying in an EA in Punggol, which supposedly is not that bad. But if one look closely, there are areas which still suck. The carpark is very dirty, the children playground is vandalized, the lift smells, and there's dog poop every here and there, so we gotta be very careful where we walk. 
 

Comparing the difference in maintainance fees we pay, you get more value staying in a Condo.




/

Is it that bad or just you are unlucky? I stay there but am enjoying the ambience and the landscaping which is different from other HDB. And if some japanese and ang moh can stay there which I have seen quite a few in punggol plaza, my block and jogging around punggol, it definitely must be clean to a standard.

In the long run, you will need to pay substantial lump for major repairs and maintenance as 150 is hardly enough to build a decent sinking fund.

What I say may prick some people here if they dont take it with an open mind.
 

Suburban Condos can be compared to your standard Premium Jap Saloon today

In the past, it was difficult to own even a 1.6 liter Jap car let alone a condo

Today, it is not as difficult (largely due to credit and leverage possibilities) and growing affluence 

So everyone (who never had one before) craves for one. 
 

but whats the true real most meaningful differentiating factor between a condo and a HDB?

Answer:-  The people who live in it.

Pricking already?

Enough or not depends. 

In five years can accumulate that amount means you are staying in a condo with many many households.

(aka fenced up public housing)

Decent or not depends on the number of units and number of blocks. Each unit should contribute about $1k pa to sinking fund.

many SG ppl stays in condo are for face value. after reading today's ST special report, there

are many ugly sides of condo dwellers who cannot bend below their high dignity, many simply

do not have the virtue of sharing...they think they own the whole condo.

Property tax of my EA flat is $348 before gahman rebate. Property tax is 4% based on annual value which roughly equate rental value. So you are rite that the unit must be small if property tax is cheaper than my HDB flat.

my old folks is paying almost $2000 for their condo, that's why surprise to see Fit44

paid only $282. If my old folks's unit is 1,300sq ft, that means his unit is smaller than

500sq ft. For that, to pay $150/mth of maintenance/sinking fund is really exhorbitant.

The condo you are living in must be < 5yrs old.

Maintenance + sinking fund is not usually so low, as what you had stated.
 

Sometime back, when I was living in a condo, the maintenance fee started at about $200+/month.

This grew with time, to about $250/month.
 

But after 5 years, due to the need to build up a sinking fund for repairs and repainting, the maintenance fee (inclusive of sinking fund) grew to $500+/month.
 

Paid >$1.5K a quarter, but then, my wife and I don't return from work until after 7+pm, after fetch kids / dinner and all and the kids then were < primary school age.  So for us, it was really money down the drain, sponsoring the other proprietors in the condo.

Interesting ..... there is also one ang moh expat in my work place, who park his bike in a car park slot and refused to budge even when the guards ask him to remove the bike.  His argument is that his is a large-cc bike and therefore cannot park in a normal bike slot.

Hence, the reason why some older mid-class condo tend to be ill-maintained. If facilities are not important and to ensure lower maintanence, private apartment may be a better choice. Many aren't aware that those lift maintenance contribute to a sizable portion of the fees. If a lift breakdown after the warranty, who pays? the resident kena. In HDB, you have TC to shoulder the cost. If swimming pool leaks when warranty expired how? I have heard of condo's swimming pool being shutdown because no resident want to pay for the repair cost.
 

In the past, I usually sell away my 99 leasehold condo within 5 years time. This is usually the prime period where I could fetch a more decent returns.

Or units with beautiful full-glass windows that are covered with laundry being hung from it, underwear too.

It all depends how strong the MC is. Hanging laundry in those manners that you've mentioned are not allowed in condo. In my former place, the guard actually go around asking people to keep them and hung them in proper area.
 

This happened because of the developer trying to sqeeuze the area for hanging laundry. They have this thought that people live in condo would have spare money to use dryer and no time to hang laundry in the open.

It is either their management council Bo chap or that place is make-up by many ex-HDBers whom can't kick their old-habit in HDB living. IMHO, many low cost condo don't have good deisgn for hanging laundry. Some people want to save money by DIY washing their blankets and hang them at common areas.

no matter how good the design, overtly large items like blankets and bedsheets, simply can't be hung to dry inside apartments. Either get a dryer or send to the laundromat. Anyhow hang and it can't dry properly, or might even get dirty. Like my place (HDB), some bloke puts his blanket over a parapet to dry...OMG does he know the amount of dust in the air that will land on the wet blanket? Everyday i vaccum the house, the amount of dust flying around is horrible.
 

Other equally disgusting habit is simply putting the rubbish beside the common chute instead of dumping it in. What's the prob? Already walk out to the chute already, just dump it in lah!!!

Can lah, just that you might not have came cross them. But usually condo have good laundry drying area are larger in size or have sizable balcony.
 

Dust is just like air and wind, you can't avoid them unless you shut all windows and doors. You have not tried living in places, where you actually feel the fine sand not just dust .

Let me share with u some issues which I encountered.
 

Lift maintenance company say lift cable is beyond service life. Need to replace, but is high 5 digit sum. Since No $, MC ask "Will die or not", lift company say worse case, "E brake will activate". Therefore, since no life or death situation, cable was not replaced.
 

MCST $ run out as some SP chao kuan, want to force enbloc. Other owners say wah... like that also can, so one by one follow dun pay, Cleaner salary of $600 also end up owing 2 months.
 

Water tank booster spare pump spoil also dun repair, occasionally water tank can run dry, when the one and only one servicebale one KO.
 

In the end, the place look like 3rd world slum. Everywhere also got dog poo and urine smell.
 

What is important.. MCST shd be proactive and adopt high standards, and be trigger happy to enforce regular payments. It is very easy to get 3rd world status, since sinking fund usually not much. 
 

Some older commercial buildings.. where 1 SP may own say 50% of the units.. can easily become the MCST chairman, and then dun pay the MCST funds. As MCST chairman, he can choose not to enforce payment on himself. This is how dirty it can be. 
 

Take Care hor.

some ppl always think that stay in condos are the best....
 

they never think abt the sinking funds.  maintainence and upgrading are the most impt.  and there is no gaurantee that the sinking funds are enough.
 

wait till each of unit needs to cough up $10k-$30k for repairs or upgrading, they will cry father cry mother

my condo maint fees is only $150/mth ! I have a car & a bike.

If I were to stay in a HDB, I would have paid: $60(conservency)

                                                                   $90(carpark)

                                                                   $17(bike parking)

                                                                 =$167(total)

Besides parking, I also enjoy the free facilities like: security guard,swimming pool,gym,tennis court,hot bath,free shutter bus, ect... does it make more sense staying in a condo?



 

actually i wouldnt need the facilities...for gym i can train at any cheap public gym.....
 

for pool maybe....ill use....tennis court maybe....
 

the rest i dun need....but i do know parking is free in a condo...
 

actually i think it depends.....if u have a big family then u need a bigger place....

Many times it's common for SP to simply vote "dun do", instead of cry father cry mother. Then when BCA send letter for mandatory painting works, Some SP simply cannot afford to cough up the $. It's really tough for a neighbour to send lawyer letter to another neighbour to pay up. But if dun enforce also set a bad precedent for others. 
 

Being in the council really need to be professional about it.
 

SP = Subsidary Proprietor = Owner

u r right! 11 blocks with 716 units.

738 carpark lots.

free shutter bus to mrt station from 6.30am-7.30pm daily(every 10 mins during peak hr/ 30 mins offpeak)

I paid $460per sq ft.



 
 

wow 11 blocks ? 716 units?

to me, thats public housing already.

$460psf sounds somewhat over priced.

Is it deep in the north or west?
 

that said, diff strokes for diff folks, as long as you are enjoying.

I pass by Kovan Melody and The Quartz often....disgusting, all the laundry everywhere, like some slum in China. Even ah nei in India will send their laundry to the dhoti-man to get it done instead of hanging it all around their house, in case lint flies into their expensive Darjeeling tea.

The nicest part about living in a condo is getting the friendly waves and smiles from the security guards when i drive in everyday. The warm sense of welcome is quite priceless. I also run 1 hour on the treadmill thrice a week and swim 30 minutes thrice a week so having a gym and 50m lap pool downstairs is really convenient.
 

The alternative for me is to get a landed and convert one of the rooms into a gym. Unfortunately i am not rich enough to afford one in the areas that i like, that can also accomodate a 50m pool. While i do not mind swimming in a public pool or club pool, I find that travelling from work to a public/club pool and then back home again to be really painful esp during the evening rush hour.
 

Of course different people value different things and therefore the mileage that you get from your condo will vary significantly. I find that the value one places on a condo typically depends on the condo itself, the kind of activities that one pursues, and the value one places on convenience.

Takes a discerning eye to buy a really good landed house.
 

2 houses sharing the same road can be as different as sun and moon.
 

Avoid tight roads and houses built closely facing each other. 

could be uncomfortable as privacy is lower and frustrating if traffic is not smooth.

This is my personal opinion only.
 

Never touch 99-year leasehold, unless on two (non-discretionary) conditions:
 

-  Its in the prime D.9 or D.10 (nothing less)
 

AND (its not an OR)
 

-  You plan to rent it out for a good ROI (no other options entertained)
 

The above will apply to me, be it condo or landed property (actually 99-yr leasehold landed is even worse in that aspect, IMHO and also to 'get rid' of later).

you mean this Nassim Loft?
 

http://www.singaporeexpats.com/singapore-p...do/the-loft.htm
 

I haven't seen the place but from the pictures the landscaping and the bathroom fixtures look pretty good. The kitchen furnishings and cabinets are somewhat dated though. 
 

If you are working in the CBD or Suntec then going to work in the early morning should not be a problem since traffic along orchard road should be pretty light then. But in the evenings coming back home along orchard boulevard may be quite painful. It also depends on whether your weekend activities center around the orchard road/bukit timah/holland road area or not.  
 

Overall i think it is a pretty good property. Expats will like it given that it is near to the dempsey area and tanglin mall. The relatively low number of units is a major plus as well, compared to more recent mass market examples like the 500 plus unit Rivergate (although i do like the robertson quay area very much)
 

My current favorites are boulevard residences and grange residences. Sadly both are way out of reach

I was staying in a 3rm flat for 30yrs, then I moved to a 4rm resale flat and then to a new 5rm flat.

Now I really enjoy & feels good staying in a condo. I would like to try staying in a landed property in 

future if I can afford?

I started with 3 rm condo, then hdb 5-rm then 4 rm condo again. Asked my young children if they rather stay in landed (big room and big space), but their choice firmly points towards condo (swimming pool, PG, etc). Obvious choice for children lah. 
 

Stay where you are happy why we worry abt what others think? There's a lot of people who likes to save and not tolerant to others willing to pay to have better life (not only on houses also we can see in conti-vs-non-conti car threads). Likewise there are aggressive investors who do so much better than the conservative people. Share your views but would be good not to impose one's own view and call others foolish. 
 

Btw back on condo.... I just went look look see see at the Optima @ Tanah Merah. It is 100% sold liao.

It all depends how strong the MC is. Hanging laundry in those manners that you've mentioned are not allowed in condo. In my former place, the guard actually go around asking people to keep them and hung them in proper area.
 

This happened because of the developer trying to sqeeuze the area for hanging laundry. They have this thought that people live in condo would have spare money to use dryer and no time to hang laundry in the open.
 

Regards,




if MC is weak, the residents will walk all over them. If MC is strong, they tend to

take it for granted, many will abuse the authority for personal interest.
 

face it, nobody wants to be in MC, no pay, alot of work, and worst still, chase payments, 

handle unreasonable complaints from noisy kiasus & kiasis.

yes, it's a HDB estate with fences, but not maintain by TC.

$460psf cannot be in Holland or Bukit Timah, not even Thomson.

Maybe Tuas or Woodlands. If not Geylang ave 3.

I was brought up in landed property (my dad's not mine), now living in a HDB flat. The transition is very great, quite hard to get used to, even though my dad's property was quite run-down LOL
 

Not sure about condo, though, but i think the feeling of living in landed is the best. Would try to move back to landed if i can :)

In other countries (like Indonesia), condos are needed because there are very few public 

facilities, and poor traffic conditions.

come' on, do you think singapore is a continent? it is a small tiny island, and

we have efficient public transport. 

Singapore is only 680km2 (our neighbour Truly asia is 320,000km2, where cars

are really needed.)



 

u obviously live in a good location.
 

the distance from my previous place to the bus stop (then wait anywhere from 5-12 mins for a miserable feeder bus) is the same as the distance from my current place to the MRT.
 

some places are just out of the way. good for people who have cars and like peace and quiet, but certainly not what i liked during my schooling days. additional 40 mins a day spent commuting is not something i couldn't live with, but unnecessary lah.
 

i know people who spend 3 hours a day commuting, so is our public transport that efficient? then again, i'd 'blame' them for choosing the wrong place to stay, if they had a choice, that is.

ha.. so u know  . beside yew tee mrt i still dun mind leh. but to take 20 mins bus to mrt after walking 5 mins in the hot sun is NOT my idea of convenience

suspecting many buy condos and MPVs are mainly for their children interest.

Are they becoming more complacent and more comfortable, losing their 

survival instinct in the future? SG future will be doomed.

Yap, it isn't an easy job. I was once a chairman of a MC for 2 consecutive years and ever received threatening message for wanting to increase the sinking fund. I also issued lawyer letters for residents that refuse to pay up maintenance fees. Anyway, I believe if the MC members are professionals with high integrity, there is no worry for abuse or to earn respects from the residents. 
 

I would say it is a great learning experience. It makes me more aware of the maintenance issues surrounding a condo and help me in selecting a future condo.

no lah, i stay quite far from MRT station. i have to take a feeder to a MRT station and a bus to central

where i work. all in all, commuting 1.5 hr to & fro.

this is life, we accept the way it is, regardless how troublesome or tedious. 

We are much better off than Japan, when commuting takes more than 4-5 hrs to & fro, and

work hours are super long. 

So, i shant complain when i see worse lifestyle.

For those who had stayed in HDB, condo & landed before, any comment?



 
 

If given a choice, I want to stay in a old terrace with around 2200 sqft land. I can renovate and should be pretty comfortable. 
 

The thing about condo is that u have a neighbour upstairs. Sometimes, if you are unlucky, the upstairs neighbours have many kids and the parents are ahbeng ahlians who don't care, really cannot take it. 
 

If cannot afford, I think I will get a EA which cost like 600k. Usually these HDB people are more "well kept" because the flats are more expensive. condo.... no point to me as I seldom use facilities.

Int. Terrace is very hot and stuffy during the hotter months . If you have unreasonable neighours to your left and right and behind, then good luck liao . 
 

I also heard about old neighbours moved out to nearby HDB as they can't tahan the heat and rent the house out . If have more money should try to get a corner terrace instead.

grew up in a 7rm landed.

now living in a 4rm HDB.
 

in landed, nobody would give a damn even if you are tearing down your house.

not like in hdb/condo, you got neighbors upstair/downstair/left/right always ready to complain you.
 

limited parking lots? we got our own garage behind the house. you want to park 1 car in 2 lots also can.

no need scare people stomp you also.
 

anyway, been living in the 4rm hdb for near 18 yrs.

initially, needs some getting used to the small space.

the only fun thing is the lift back then as i only come in contact with lifts in shopping centers. and also the sand playground under the flats.
 

yah, would love to move back landed when got the chance again.

ya, that is why I am looking for a place near my in-laws place where my wife grew up. It is better to buy a neighborhood you are intimately familiar with, ie lived there for a long time and know the neighbors. 
 

u buy resale in a neighbourhood you are not familiar with, u end up with frogs, snakes, etc :)

suspecting many buy condos and MPVs are mainly for their children interest.

Are they becoming more complacent and more comfortable, losing their 

survival instinct in the future? SG future will be doomed.



 

Do you know are you talking about? For people with family, if they are not working for the family, then what are they working for? Of course one should not bite off more than one can chew. As long as they can afford it, what is the concern? 
 

Many yrs back when I got my Tanjong Rhu condo for <600 psf, everyone says you must be crazy to pay this for 99yrs condo. The psf more than doubled in its peak. 
 

A few months back, many in this forum keep insisting that property is crashing. Keep quoting to see what happened to U.S. Did the crash happen? I am not saying that some of the people here was wrong. Rather, there are always 2 opposing opinions to a situation. Either can be right. Time can tell. 
 

I am no guru. Short term I am not sure.......but like it ornot 10-20 yrs from now property prices in Sgp is more likely to be higher.

good for you. as for me, i trade the convenience for $$.

In other countries (like Indonesia), condos are needed because there are very few public 

facilities, and poor traffic conditions.



 

For many people convenience is $$$. It is basically about opportunity cost of time. Instead of spending 1.5 hours commuting to and fro from work or going to and fro from the gym/pool daily, one could spend that time earning more money or spending it with your kids or loved ones. Research has shown that happiness is not related to the number of kids that you have or how much you earn. Rather, happiness is negatively related to commuting time to and from work. Time spent in the car/mrt/bus in bumper to bumper rush hour traffic is truely wasted and most people would be happier doing something else. It is therefore not surprising that people would pay more for greater convenience.

i don't have any children, but i love kids. If giving every comfort to the kids are the best for

their future, then you are right. to my believe, best preparation is to have them experienced

what is the value in life to be, instead of values shower with luxury.
 

if working very hard for family is just for luxury and not value, the message is somewhat sad.
 

my friend's kid once asked me where do i stay, HDB or condo. 

in his young age, he has learned indeed, from his peers or parents. Materialism over value

ppl in forum are mostly not expert in property for sure. but the rising concern is,

those high prices of property is jacking up the uncompetitiveness in SG against

our neighbours. hence more business, jobs will be lost.

what is it like after IR? Manufacturing sector is down by more than 20%, the only

positive is construction, becoz of IR & some pvt projects.
 

like it or not, SG is going into a vicious spiral downward spin.
 

of coz, its their money, not mine. 

but i am just curious how many SGeans are just ignorant, or are they just 

gambling? it is interesting to know who will have the last laugh.

(my bet is Banks)

There are definitely parents that spoil their kids. There are also many well off families that bring up good chidren. Do not generalize. 
 

Also.... children are very innocent. When yr friend's kid asked you that question, he may not be assessing your net worth.

This is my personal opinion only.
 

Never touch 99-year leasehold, unless on two (non-discretionary) conditions:
 

-  Its in the prime D.9 or D.10 (nothing less)
 

AND (its not an OR)
 

-  You plan to rent it out for a good ROI (no other options entertained)
 

The above will apply to me, be it condo or landed property (actually 99-yr leasehold landed is even worse in that aspect, IMHO and also to 'get rid' of later).



 

Your opinion is very much appreciated

one of my friends who is 50yrs old, told me that he had stayed in HDB 3rm, executive Man, terr hse b4.

He said the best hse to stay is a old HDB 4rm flat/high floor/corner unit.

reasons being, old 4rm flat is very big compare to the new one. corner unit got more privacy, high floor more windy.

yet u pay $48 for conserv fees only plus lots of gov rebates & subsidy. 

3rm flat too small, exc mans too big(cleaning very siong!) terr hse very hot&stuffy...

interesting, no matter what i still prefer to stay in my house rather than an old 4 rm HDB.
 

not forgetting, living does include other surroundings factors, not simply the physical property itself
 

Also, living is not always about what is more value for money or cheaper.

no lah, i stay quite far from MRT station. i have to take a feeder to a MRT station and a bus to central

where i work. all in all, commuting 1.5 hr to & fro.

this is life, we accept the way it is, regardless how troublesome or tedious. 

We are much better off than Japan, when commuting takes more than 4-5 hrs to & fro, and

work hours are super long. 

So, i shant complain when i see worse lifestyle.



 

well, i appreciate where i live now, even though i drive.
 

all amenities i need within 5 mins walking distance. in the past, 5 mins can't even get me to a bus stop with just one feeder service with crap intervals.
 

since my wife does not drive, the location does matter. of course, if have chauffeur or everyone drives, then the most ulu location will be good. i do appreciate peace and quiet if i don't have to go anywhere . having said tt, my current area is peaceful enough

As a kid, i lived in a terrace house of that size....OMG it was a disaster, i hated all the years spent there (Upper Thomson area). A terrace house is usually blocked on 3 sides, so the house is very very hot and stuffy. Freaky manz....and when it rains, the rear yard floods and tiny frogs appear out of nowhere, jumping all over the house hahaha.
 

My cousin's place at Winsor Park even more power, got monkeys raiding the kitchen, once even a 3 metre long python LOL
 

Now my dad's semi-d at Seletar is much better, no such nonsense issues.



 

one thing about all homes is that u'd need to set aside money for maintenance. no maintenance, things will start looking like crap after awhile. landed is obviously the most expensive to upkeep, just for the maintenance aspect
 

for apartments, the exterior is maintained for u, and the interior is easier to upkeep. of course, u have less space, so it's a trade off.

you should be. 
 

there's no such thing as a good location for everyone imho. a good location is one which gives the lowest TOTAL travelling time among all the members of the household.
 

of course, if both work in extreme east or west, then that area becomes a 'good location' for that family/couple.

fully agree. of course, each has their own different needs.
 

i stay 3-rm, but old 4-rm would be perfect. 3-rm is rather cramped even for two adults only.
 

but then again, i do know fairly well-off households with 3 or more pple staying in 3-rm flat. they seem quite happy with where they stay.

Anyway what u guyz think of bukit timah rd free hold 2 yrs old condo call nexus? MRT gg to be build nearby, Ok for investment? Quoted 1 million 30k for a 2 bed room, mid flr, face bukit timah rd. Very ex now, 900 plus psf few mths ago only.



 

Before you buy Nexus (or even the next-door Floridian), I'd suggest you go there on the following times:
 

(1)  Weekday, between 6:00 - 7:30 AM.

Long jam in front of the condo, along the service road toward Blackmore Road (MGS).

Residents at these 2 condos (and Maplewoods) can only turn left at their respective exit gates.

So LL, you will have to join the queue.

But of course, if you start off to work after 8:00 AM, this should not be an issue.
 

(2)  Weekday, between 6:00 - 8:00 PM ..... sometimes even until 10:00pm

Bukit Timah Road will be jammed.  From the Anak Bukit juction, sometimes backing up all the way to Chinese High School / Hwa Chong JC.

These are the people living in Upper Bukit Timah, Bukit Panjang and Choa Chu Kang returning home.
 

The above 2 scenerios - you will never get to see it when you go visit the show flat on a weekend.

Buyer beware!

There are no 2000-2500 sqft semi-Ds in Moonbeam, Ming Teck, Greenleaf, or Mt Sinai areas.

Corner terraces of that size, yes.
 

Most of the older semi-Ds in the above locales are between 3500-3900 sqft.
 

You still may get smaller ~2500 sqft semi-Ds in those areas, but these are usually the new, redeveloped ones (where developer bought a bungalow and dissects it into 4 semi-Ds, or 4 linked bungalows (semi-Ds that are conjoined back-to-back, not side-by-side).  They are usually 4-5 floors high, or 3-4 floors including a basement (which I think is crazy, to walk up and down stairs, or the high maintenance cost, if it comes with a lift!).  However, since you plan to rebuild, these new-concept squeezed semi-Ds are not for you.
 

There may be some smaller-sized 2500+ sqft semi-Ds at areas like Namly though.

Mingteck confirm no ... mostly 1800 to 2000 

Moonbeam ... got quite a good mix of 1800 to 2500 

Greenleaf have ... more like 25 to 30 (thats why i din mention greenleaf) 

Mt Sinai .... not very keen .... too far from main road and traffic too heavy. 
 

namly is ok ... can consider also. 
 

i know my this "side-by-side" requirement is the toughest.

thats why a lot of agent dont want to take up my offer. 

no choice ... have to cast a wider net to the audience here.

Are you sure these are semi-Ds?

Plot areas of 1800-2000 sqft is too small for semi-Ds in these enclaves.
 

Or did you mean corner terraces?
 

There may be some of these 'downsized', multi-storey, semi-Ds built brand new over the last decade, by developers who had bought old land and sub-divided.
 

But beware that some of them may be 99-yr leasehold, like those found in Garlick Ave and Kings Road areas - mostly 2000-2500 sqft.  Very small areas, but built upwards.

I have the same mind set...  ...I have a Condo which I can park 4 Cars in a sheltered multi story car park...1 Motor-Bike + 3 Bicycles... 

Just for the Cars to park in a HDB would cost me $360 excluding the Bike.

My maintenance per month in that condo is less than $300, so the rest of the stuff for me is like a bonus.

hahah  
 

you mean this Nassim Loft?
 

http://www.singaporeexpats.com/singapore-p...do/the-loft.htm
 

I haven't seen the place but from the pictures the landscaping and the bathroom fixtures look pretty good. The kitchen furnishings and cabinets are somewhat dated though. 
 

If you are working in the CBD or Suntec then going to work in the early morning should not be a problem since traffic along orchard road should be pretty light then. But in the evenings coming back home along orchard boulevard may be quite painful. It also depends on whether your weekend activities center around the orchard road/bukit timah/holland road area or not.  
 

Overall i think it is a pretty good property. Expats will like it given that it is near to the dempsey area and tanglin mall. The relatively low number of units is a major plus as well, compared to more recent mass market examples like the 500 plus unit Rivergate (although i do like the robertson quay area very much)
 

My current favorites are boulevard residences and grange residences. Sadly both are way out of reach

In actual fact, I had Spring Grove in mind, when I stipulated the 99-yr leasehold investment criteria of mine:
 

Prime D.9 or D.10 AND Plan to rent it out for a good ROI

I was brought up in landed property (my dad's not mine), now living in a HDB flat. The transition is very great, quite hard to get used to, even though my dad's property was quite run-down LOL
 

Not sure about condo, though, but i think the feeling of living in landed is the best. Would try to move back to landed if i can :)



 
 

liked you, lived half my life in condo( parent's) . but now staying in HDB .luckily the area is a console to live 110m2, and the layout was perfect. but still looking forward to move back to private estate.

but again personally, i find local private estate , OR i would say most begining to feel congested, and

pigeon hole.thus with so much appreciated value in the properties sector, steer away from this "bubble"

i would agree with most bros here , sleep better and well with less burden.

what i miss about landed property, is the ability to grow small trees. My dad's place has chiku, mango, coconut, and many pots of herbs, even a small orange-pomelo mix tree.
 

I also like the convenience of just opening the gate and taking things out of the car if needed, while dressed in your boxers only LOL
 

my wife always makes fun of that place as "u mean that kampong house ah?"....but the feeling of being able to see orioles chirping in your tree early in the morning is priceless, don't u think?

if condo in TP with 99 yrs leasehold that will be going at 1200 per sqf,

u think the freehold condo at mt spohia will still sell at 1200 per sqf??

hope this bubble goes soon so that the real pple who want to buy and not speculate can own them 

at a more realistic price.
 
 
 
 




1200-1300 psf can get those freehold condos at mount sophia (just behind plaza sing).

Are you sure these are semi-Ds?

Plot areas of 1800-2000 sqft is too small for semi-Ds in these enclaves.
 

Or did you mean corner terraces?
 

There may be some of these 'downsized', multi-storey, semi-Ds built brand new over the last decade, by developers who had bought old land and sub-divided.
 

But beware that some of them may be 99-yr leasehold, like those found in Garlick Ave and Kings Road areas - mostly 2000-2500 sqft.  Very small areas, but built upwards.



 

i know my miserable budget will not be able to get semi d 6 Ave

so if even both are IT side by side or 1 IT join to 1 CT ... i happy also 
 

but if it is seran gdn or mimosa ... it must be semi d 
 

from the discussion below ... someone suggested watten or greenwood 

not a bad idea also

I used to stay in Landed, then Private Apartment and now my own HDB.
 

I really missed staying in Landed. We had a huge garden with mango tree, papaya tree, banana tree, chiku tree, rambutan tree, jackfruit tree, lime tree, chilli tree and pandan plants. We get our supply of fruits directly from our garden!!! There is a short driveway to the house and an open air garage. Can park easily 8-10 cars esp during CNY when the extended family come and visit.
 

When I was young, we always run ard the garden doing all sorts of things + having two doberman dogs and one boxer dog help past the time. Oh ya, we had also one hen who would lay eggs every single morning!!!
 

And the location is not far from the city. Its at Novena. The property is still there and within my family. Will visit it once in a while, remembering the fun times.
 
 

Was not used to HDB when I first moved in 4yrs ago. Looking at the condition of the letterbox areas and lift enough to piss me off. But no choice, I am only a regular salaried employee.

Last time when i lived in Bukit Timah, just to avoid the evening rush hour traffic along BT and Holland Road, i used to stay in the office till 11pm before heading back home. Nowadays i am typically home by 6pm.



 

Did you use to take a detour to JB before hitting Bukit Timah?   
 

I leave Shenton Way around 6:15-6:30.  30 minutes door to door to the Adam Road area.

Bukit timah is a very long road as you know.

depending on where you stay along bukit timah, it can be a 20 min diff especially when it chokes up.

I used to be around the cluny park road area. 15 mins back home from Suntec after wiping the tables.
 

great location.

That I agree.  But staying in the office till 11PM to avoid traffic congestion....  
 

To OT a little bit - that's why I set up a a workspace in my home - take my conf calls and log into the office intranet via VPN after the kids sleep, so that I can maximize my time with them.  That personal time disappears all too quickly.
 

Contrast that to an ex-boss of mine whose wife refuses to let him take work home - and therefore he doesn't get to see his kids at night...

Yup, ard that area.
 

It was bought during my grand parent's time, after 2nd world war. It cost only S$30k then. Now, its tens of millions cos of the large land area in a prime location. Thatz why there is war between my eight aunties and uncles.  Oops, should be seven, oldest uncle killed by the Japanese.

No i took a detour to KL before hitting BT  
 

Actually it is from City Hall to Sixth Ave and along Holland Road. If i leave the office at 645pm it may take anywhere between 30 min to 1 hour. It is not fun travelling in bumper to bumper traffic in the evenings. Everyone's impatient, tired, and frustrated after a hard day's work. People seem more patient in the morning. Also the neverending MRT construction that made a mess of the Holland Village area does not help. So i'd rather wait till 11pm when it takes me 20 minutes to zip home from office in relatively sparse traffic. 
 

I actually enjoy driving very much. Winding up the revs and listening to the engine/exhaust note is a great stress reliever. But it is hard to do that between 6-8pm along Holland/BT road. Of course if i have kids i would probably brave the traffic just to spend time with them.

In general, buyers combine income is capped at S$4.5K x 2 = $9K.
 

CPF is 34.5% x $9K = $3,105 and only certain percentage can be use to repay the installment.
 

There are those who speculate & those who are upgraders & some who hope for en-bloc, etc.

I do think this kinda price won't crash as it will be sustainable more than compared to 97. The 07 era was a litmus test. With prices dropping more than 30% from the peak and rebounding back, there wasn't much fanfare about auction or force-selling.. 
 

That means, holding power has increased even though with many TOPs and valuation dropping in the midst of DPS basis..
 

Now with the removal of DPS, suburban showflats are still a sold out, it can only attribute to the IAS. With IAS, the twist to DPS just got an 'insurance' from the bank that affordability is even made easier, as long as you have proven the ability to finance the first 20% (else how can they even approved your loan application for IAS?).
 

So I do not think there will be any bubble so easily this time. The prices will hold good for some time to come. Alas, those waiting for a crash to buy in will be waiting neck long long, like me..

it has been very entertaining and enriching for my knowledge about singapore property scene on this thread.  Many of the brothers here i supposed are in their 40's who been through a few cycles of the property up/down. 
 

Most of the well to do individuals are pinning on the hopes that property is a protection for their old age, most of us hope that by buying a 1mill property, 20 year down the road, this property will fetch 2-3 millions and thus cater for their/our retirement. (just like one of the thread mentioned that his grand father brought the landed at novena at 30k in 1940's and now it is worth 10 over millions). i am not a financial guru, but one thing for sure - do we really have the numbers of people to cater for such a demand in 20 yrs times ? even if we rely on foreign or fallen talents - do they want to invest a big amount of money in a place like singapore. secondly, is our next generation able to earn such income level to cater for further property upside. i hope someone can shed some light on this topic for me, because i also wish to have a feel on it even no one can predict it. 
 

base on the property boom cycle over past 10 years, i think there is no longer a case of a fixed pattern cycle. therefore those who went in without the holding power are the potential one to be listed on the bankrupt list. i suppose this current boom is not demand driven but mainly speculative driven as most felt that having cash in bank is eyesore with a paltry sum of interest. And to make it worst , interest has been so cheap that it make lot of going on the route of 'over leaverage'. correct me if i am wrong.
 

i m in my late 30's and has been happily staying in hbd but most of my peers has been chanting at me to get a private landed unit or at least a condo, 

but i still firmly believed having cash in hand offer more happinese than having a bigger roof. anyone can englightened further....

No, not foolish. Those Indonesia tai tai or foreign buyers could well be washing dirty money.
 

In another words, those money could be one of the major contributing factors that help prop up the property market.
 

Remember how Jakarta gov tried in vein to get Singapore gov to cooperate in getting those allegedly corrupted rich & powerful people parking their $$$ in Singapore?
 

And don't forget how Singapore was once promoted as "Switzerland of Asia"?  It has 2 sides of the coin.
 

So who are the real "fools" in current cycle of property upswing?

Any older events? I was too young then..



 

IMO, it is more do with how frequent the economic pendulum had being swinging in the last 2 decades rather than how fall back one can recall the history.
 

Right after the 97 Asian financial crisis, we saw dot-com crash in 2000 after which there global economy grew unimpeded.
 

SARS or 9/11 events, although are historic events, only caused a temporary dip in rather "resilient" global market until 2007/8.
 

So what marks the similarity between 1997, 2000 & 2008, all of which severely impact millions of livelihood?
 

It was not disease, war nor natural calamities..
 

It is human greed.

IMO, there is no need to talk about property investment if you only have 1 unit. 

My house is now worth double the price i paid in 2006. Then again, the sell price can never get me another same size nearby.

In short, what ever 'gain' is just absolute term!
 

I am also surprise some of my peers are boasting new condo they got recently, at over a mil & paying mere 10-20%DP with 30yr loan.

i agree that property in SGP can only go up. But the question is can you sustain the ups/down in our ever changing economy?

Owning your 1 and only pte property will not make you any gain even when market picks up.

Own?  That is a wrong word to use.
 

By paying 20% DP and taking 80% bank loan, you do NOT own the condo.  Its mortgaged to the bank.

When you sell, you return the 80% to the bank + interest already paid up.
 

So when people say I own so-and-so condo, the question will need to be: "Do you really own it, or the bank?".

By DEC 2012 i will fully paid up my HDB. In the mean time i am also saving for a 2nd home to collect rental in old age. My hdb which i bought for $203k is bring in a rental returns of $24000 PA. Which is about 12% ROI. Say if i sell my house now 4 $450K and put the $$$ in a bank i will only get $4000 PA.

Maybe I am stupid...too much details   but I still don't see whats your point and what has your first paragraph got to do with your last statement

I believe he is trying to say the ROI base on rental for hdb is better than condo. I guess bottom line is when he bought it. If  he bought it now based on his 450K price, the ROI will only be abt 5%. so everything abt the whole issue is...... timing is important for your investment!

First of all, forgive me if you think i am missing the point listed by a lot of bros and sisters here.
 

Lotsa talks about condo being overpriced, bad investment, 99-yrs-whats-the-big-deal...while i dont deny those claims but you can say the same for the newly or those so called premium HBD in so called premium housing estates (yes I have a cheap condo at 600k+ only).
 

For folks like me who don't earn enough to stay in high end condo, why do we still get a condo?  For me, my priorities are simple.  If I need to pay roughly the same for a resale HDB (doesnt help I dont qualify for new flats), I rather pay a bit extra more for my wife and my kid (yeah early next year!) to enjoy a better quality of life...
 

1.  Better security...paid guards that actually patrol the area and stop to question strangers what are they doing in the estate and who will not hesitate to clamp vehicles from non-resident that park at non designated area
 

2.  A good gym and a good pool which I can enjoy and when my kid is older, I can let my kid learn swimming at the pool.
 

3.  Function room/ KTV room/ pool room/ BBQ facilities where i can use to host parties
 

4. Parking lot that is always available for me and I dont need to walk 10 minutes to get home from the parking lot
 

5.  Generally more peaceful without young ah bengs running around and shouting...
 

Ok...those are very subjective intangible benefits which may not be important to some of you folks.  But yeah those are important to me and so I prefer to pay more for a condo instead of staying in a HDB. 
 

End of the day, to each his own.  If you can well afford a condo but you choose to stay in a HDB, you have your reasons.  But honestly unless you have stayed in a condo before, you can't comment much beyond the obvious statistics on paper.  
 

And lastly, I rather dumped my money in a 99 yrs condo that will not belong to me in 99 yrs than to a HDB.  Maybe that just me.

I get what u mean. Frankly speaking resale HDB is really crazy nowadays. 500-600k plus for certain estate....... with that $ u can get a low end Condo liao. HDB will soon get beyond us soon.

condo in east (2001) = 750K (1200sqf)

My HDB in punggol (2001) = 203K (also 1200sqf)
 

condo inthe east (2009 aug rental) = $2700pm

My place in punggol (2009 rental) =$1900pm
 

Returns based on rental

ROI (PA)for condo in the east = (4.3%)

ROI (PA) for HDB = (11.2%)
 

Returns on capital appreciation

Sell ur condo now @1mil - 750k = profit of 250k (excluding interest payable to bank)

Sell my HDB now @ $450K -203k = profit of 247k (also exclude interest payable to HBD)
 

I am talking about Condo price vs Hdb price in relation to Condo returns Vs HDB returns

Actually, both of you are right.  He is talking about investment and ROI, you are talking about own stay with good life style and children safety.
 

So the conclusion is that for investment HDB has better return and rental yield.  For family own staying, condo provide better facilities and more comfortable life style.

HaHa,  I saw both of you were talking in different frequencies - one about rental yield and the other on life style.  You were never come to an agreement with each other.
 

I was a bank employee and turned businessman (small business) a few years ago.  In fact, I went through all these issues before.  I owned a condo and rented it out for a few years.  The ROI was not that good and I sold it away in 2007 when condo price was good.

 I've stayed in condo before and before that in HDB, and i'm staying in landed property now. Can I comment? 
 

For lifestyle, nothing beats having your own land...it may not have all the facilities you mention, like armed guards and gym, but i believe its a choice...if i want to convert a room to a gym, I can.  If i want to put a pool in my garden, I can. if i want guards patrolling my area, i can... in fact you can get all that in strata bungalows now...
 

But for best returns, stay with HDB...that of course puts condo dwellers somewhere in between...not to say its bad, but its not here, not there....so its a compromise.
 

My 2 cents...

You type.... so...many pointers and yet you missed the most important point!  ...
 

The amount of maintenance funds you contribute can at least be 'privately' managed and accounted for...not what you get for the pigeon holers where they 'don't know who's hands are on the money' and what hell was LOST for doing what not!
 

They ( the pigeon holers) didn't even have a say but yet it was their hard earned money!

many people always say those who buy condos at current high price are foolish and will stand to lose big in time to come, but in the end, it is always the ones who bought the so-called expensive properties who become rich and become the last to laugh. so dont laugh at them too fast.

Nothing to compare, no Condo in Punggol for me to compare. Also no developer wants to built a condo in punggol cause nobody wants to buy condo in waste land. So I am comparing Extreme with Extreme. On one end there is a HDB in some faraway land on the other extreme Condo in D14,15. near marina the next big thing on the red dot.
 

Showing that even Faraway land beats paradise on Returns.
 

So Condo no big deal.
 

For the past 7 years i had moved from
 

3rm in Marine parade to 5 rm in Punggol to Semi-d in Joo chiat to 2700sft  condo in Kembangan to 3rm in Marine Parade. Come DEC i will move again dunno to where. Searching now.
 

So from my experience in staying in a few dif kinds of housing. I came to a conclusion, everywhere is the same it is the plp u will be staying with makes all the dif. 
 

Condo got ah beng too, worst still condo got alot of angmo. who thinks they own the whole place. HDB good no Angmo wants to be seen living with pigeons. Now our pigeons holes got many camera too. Carpark n lift full of camera. So far in my 33 years living in Singapore with most of the time spend in HDB, i had not been butt raped, my mum not once was robbed, my sister wasn't molested, My niece n nephew wasn't kidnapped, Lucky i was the one who molested my wife it wasn't someone else.
 

Condo security better? Like an underground Bunker? Dont gave excuses about the higher quality of life, i dont buy that.
 

I LUV my HDB 

All i need is cable, Broadband, Aircon and my wife by myside i happy liao.

Yep, for those who qualify for the subsidised HDB flats, they should always buy it, doesn't matter about perceived status, private condos just can't match the yields.

I dont think Punggol is a "wasteland" judging by the influx of BTO coming up in the region. If im not wrong, after the completion of the $25 million waterway project in 2010, we shld be able to see some condo sites projects just along the waterway(which are considered prime locations)...

Trouble is....
 

The new HDB projects built by private developers are priced too close to condo prices...Half mil for 1st hand public housing? See The Pinnacle...

We are not talking old-skooled,traditional SG housing estate type being cannibalised by the recent surge of condos...

Before this , ppl queued like crazy for DBSS,BTO...whatever...

"They" are pushing for that kinda projects before the masses ran to full-fledged condos...

"They" fell flat on their faces and now on damage control PR exercise...
 

So might as well buy condo...Ultimately, conservancy and carpark charges are not much cheaper than condo maintenance fees...

At least condos come with properly done manicured lawns , pool ,security and proper maintenance... not some lazy-axxed Bangla and even lazier property officers...

Somethings someone not telling truthfully...
 

The truth is out there....
 

So, if you think HDB is good enuff for you and family...

Good for you...
 

If I want to bleed $$$ monthly, at least I want to know where it's goin and see where most of it had gone to...

Not to a blackhole called TC or HDB....

Hahahahahaha!

Hehe I told my wife and she said she's glad I am willing to forgo thicker wallet for a more comfortable lifestyle for her and my coming-soon baby  
 

I guess we can agree to disagree.  I make more money so that my family can stay in better comfort.  I am glad I don't have the same wavelength as you do.  I guess that's just me.
 

On a side note, I know of this guy who used to make 17k a month.  He doesnt drive a car, cited its expensive....take cab is cheaper.  He stays in a HDB, say buy condo siao....HDB better.  So he makes lotsa money but it doesn't translate to comfort living for his family.  Well...maybe different values.

Agree with you. I think I have the same mindset as you. 
 

Some people just like to see $$$ growing in the bank.....and they sort of lose their focus on why they struggle to earn the $$$ in the first place......
 

$$$ is only a means to an end....
 

Some people slog all their lives and never enjoy the fruits of their labour even till their death bed......the children will prob just waste the inheritance away as they did not earn the $$$ themselves....easy come, easy go....

I don't see much difference between a HDB and a average condo, both are pigeon holes anyway. Landed house also has its problem too, from what i observe from friends and relatives who stay in landed house, mosquito, insects, hot and no wind etc. I think the best is to stay in pent house.

a shelter is a shelter, but the quality of life is totally different.
 

They call it HDB-Lessee vs Pte-Subsidiary Proprietors.
 

Penthouses isn't that great if you ever stayed in one. equally as hot and warm during summer.

You type.... so...many pointers and yet you missed the most important point!  ...
 

The amount of maintenance funds you contribute can at least be 'privately' managed and accounted for...not what you get for the pigeon holers where they 'don't know who's hands are on the money' and what hell was LOST for doing what not!
 

They ( the pigeon holers) didn't even have a say but yet it was their hard earned money!
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

=================================================================

I always say the truth which might appear to be nasty but hell...if you want to read and hear nice things...tune in to your local radio and TV shows!



 

Dont be too happy. You look at NKF and Ren Ci as examples. They are charity organisation with good intentions but what happen to the funds? So anything is possible. I already dont trust any organisation or group holding my money anymore except myself, let alone HDB or Condo maintenance fund ever since the Durai case. The main thing is to that they do their job keeping the surrounding clean and well maintenance. If not call or write email to screw them!

if i compare a HDB in punggol and a condo in sengkang or near to punggol the returns from a condo in punggol will fare even worst.



 

I'm talking about comparing a HDB in Marine Parade with a condo in Sengkang... you sure you will get the same result?

How do you define quality of life? Does staying in condo mean a better quality of life? I don't think so loh. U can stay in HDB but still enjoy a quality lifestyle. Is all about your priority in life. I have seen ppl who are cash rich staying in HDB, house fully paid, change car every 4-5 yrs and is fully paid, own country club membership, every year go holiday with family. I have also seen ppl staying in condo, have to think twice when spending, buying car got to think here think there and end up still driving their 7yrs old car, no holiday so far. So tell me who is having quality life? And i don't see anything wrong with staying in 99 yrs lease, afterall we don't live that long so what is the diff.

Nicely put mate...though I don't quite agree on the car part as motivation to choose between HDB and condo hehe. Otherwise, I think you hit the nail spot on!

Agree that it is all relative and down to the different circumstances each individual is in....
 

It's like asking why drive a lexus when you can drive a camry (since both are toyota), then you start to ask why drive a camry when you can drive a kia (since both are cars) and finally, there will be some that ask why even bother to drive when you can be driven all around by SBS, SMRT and Comfort????  
 

Frankly not all lexus owners are in debt and neither are all public transport users debt-free either....

At the end of the day.....to put it bluntly, having more money means more options.......
 
 

If you have money......you can afford to have cars, condos, country clubs, expensive holidays....BUT it's your prerogative if you choose to live a prudent lifestyle like living in HDB...take BMW.....go Genting for holiday...
 
 
 

If no money.....living in HDB is no longer about choice.....taking the BMW is no longer about choice.....going to Genting for family holiday is no longer about choice....
 

So, I do not see any point in arguing condo is better or HDB is better.....if you can afford to stay in condo but choose to stay in HDB...good for you.....but do not criticize others who made a lifestyle choice so long as they can afford it......
 

If you can only afford to stay in HDB.....all the more please do not have the sour grapes mentality that afflict quite a number of singaporeans....

 Dun worry...not elitist...becos even stay condo also got different grade/class....u compare staying in a condo in the suburbs vs one in districts 9, 10...
 

truth is, most hdb upgraders can only afford to stay in suburban condos...is it an indication they are better than HDB dwellers? maybe....but u look at those who stay in these condos vs those in district 9, haha...very big difference...
 

so no use comparing HDB vs Condo etc...

I dont think Punggol is a "wasteland" judging by the influx of BTO coming up in the region. If im not wrong, after the completion of the $25 million waterway project in 2010, we shld be able to see some condo sites projects just along the waterway(which are considered prime locations)...



 

Anyone remember the term 'Punggol 21'?  If 10+ years of low-price HDBs did not increase in increasing demand and population density, I'm sure a series of prime developments would..

I dont like to put anyone down, but those pple on strata-living will know what is quality of life.
 

And most importantly, pte property is very flexible bcoz you owned it and you can do whatever u want so long within the strata-title act.

It was a tongue-in-cheek comment, Singaporeans need to learn to lighten up, Ang Mohs already think we're the most "sour-faced" amongst all Asians, stinky Honkies included.
 

Empirically speaking though, my personal experience suggests this is a "Yes".
 

When I was renting a condo in D10, the dates I brought back would :

A) Spend the night (100%)

B) Played "hide the maypole" with me (95%)
 

At the same time, I had an uncle who had a fully-furnished empty HDB unit in Marine Parade, sometimes I would crash the night there, the dates that I brought back there would:

A) Spend the night (10%)

B) Played "hide the maypole" with me (1%)

agree with you. simply don't understand.. there's bound to be pro and con when making a choice.. how a decision can be made is very much individual.. some are more into money, some are more into lifestyle.. 

some just want to have it..

Happy staying in your HDB  . 
 

Hehe I told my wife and she said she's glad I am willing to forgo thicker wallet for a more comfortable lifestyle for her and my coming-soon baby  
 

I guess we can agree to disagree.  I make more money so that my family can stay in better comfort.  I am glad I don't have the same wavelength as you do.  I guess that's just me.
 

On a side note, I know of this guy who used to make 17k a month.  He doesnt drive a car, cited its expensive....take cab is cheaper.  He stays in a HDB, say buy condo siao....HDB better.  So he makes lotsa money but it doesn't translate to comfort living for his family.  Well...maybe different values.



 
 

must strike a balance la, earn $ but also must spend $ to enjoy then is quality of life, ultimately $ kep in bankbook is nothing more than numbers until u use it.

He's tellin the truth..I second that...

It's ridiculous at 1st but it seems that a lot more fellas,guy frens & chicks alike, more willing to spend the nite over rather than when I stayed in HDB with my parents and even when they are away on long holiday...
 

These days I dun invite anyone anymore...I got married...hahahahaha!

So, I do not see any point in arguing condo is better or HDB is better.....if you can afford to stay in condo but choose to stay in HDB...good for you.....but do not criticize others who made a lifestyle choice so long as they can afford it......
 

If you can only afford to stay in HDB.....all the more please do not have the sour grapes mentality that afflict quite a number of singaporeans....



 

i second that. it is many singaporeans' mentality. not able to afford luxuries and not contented. still talk a lot about financial smarter or better management of fund, blah blah blah.

haha, true true.
 

this reminds me of a story of my neighbor (HDB).

a man who was about 25 yrs older than me (can be my father already)
 

When i was in my early 20s, i bot a new 800cc Honda motorbike.

This neighbor of mine saw the bike and then came down to have a closer look.

After a while, he scoffed :-" why dont you buy a Kawasaki?  kawasaki is better....etc.... last time when i was young i ride Kawasaki"   

Then i turned and looked at his COE Yamaha 125cc, and nodded.  "ok, ok"
 

Many years later after i moved out of HDB to bukit timah, I bought an 1100cc Kawasaki.

Visited my parents at my old place, and this same guy came to have a look again.

"why dont you buy Honda, nice design, engine good" he said.

I turned and looked at his same COE Yamaha 125cc and nodded "ok ok"
 

Some things dont change.  

People who cannot afford or are not using their own money to buy will give the loudest opinions.

I think one of the dudes here mentioned this point too.  fully second that.

Why u nvr "put table at Ritz KATURNnnnn"?......(Yes, my tis fren "ang moh" sucks)

The food there veri nice. I gt "lobang" mah. Why u nvr ask me?......(we haven even start eating)

Ur photo nt bad hor,.....bt I knw 1 "camel" man who take veri gd photo. He do for many ppl. Next time okay.......(Nabeh, curse my fren & the wife)
 

My fren & I knwing the fella he is, forgives him & move on.......BTW, he is not married & we believe he has zero experience in organizing weddings. Thus his nickname, after nearly 2 decades, still stays wif him......"Tua Tow".

Actually staying in a condo is rather nice. Have own team of maintainence pple to take care of enviroment, sani etc. If there is anything not to standard, just report and it gets done fast. For hdb, i am not sure how fast tc solve the issues. But then in about 1 year time i will be owning a hdb apartment  I hope tc will do a good job in maintaining the area. Been to my friends flat before in serangoon central area and I must say lots of food shops there! The ground floor and lift is also quite clean. But the exterior seems rather old. So i suppose reasons why some pple choose to stay in hdb or condo have their own preference.
