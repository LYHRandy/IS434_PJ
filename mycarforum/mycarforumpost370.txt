Hi all,Needed some advices as me and my wife couldn't decide which way to go.I shall tell my story in point form.1. Currently living in a 5 room flat in woodlands.2. Bank loan left 8 years to clear about $52K.3. Applied for a 4 room BTO flat and was lucky enough to have slected a flat next   to Bedok Mall and opposite Bedok MRT.4. We had paid the the $2k option fee.
5. Pending to pay $52k(10% downpayment) + $15k(3% stamp fee). These 13% going to cost    us about $67K.6. We have $50k cash on hand. Another $15k from my wife CPF.7. Wife just became PR 2 years ago. Therefore her CPF OA was little.8. My CPF OA was used to service the bank loan of our current flat.9. The amount was just enough to service the monthly loan.
10. New BTO flat in Bedok TOP 2021.
11. Selling our current Woodlands flat in 2021 need to pay HDB $50k levy.12. Expected bank loan left around $30k in 2021.13. I am using a safe amount to calculate. Let's say we only managed to sell our     Woodlands flat for $400k in 2021. Minus levy and leftover bank loan.     we can get back $320k from our Woodlands flat.14. I knew out of the $320k that i get back. About half need to goes back to my     CPF OA. But these money that went back to CPF OA will be used to pay for our     New Bedok flat in 2021.15. New flat left $470k after the downpayment. HDB able to grant us about $150k loan.16. Therefore we have no problem for the new flat. We only need to save another    $50k - $70k to renovate our new flat in 2021.Option 11. Thinking of investing our $50k cash on hand on oversea property. Wife is from china   Hainan Dao.2. We are thinking of buying a small condo unit about 40 square meter that cost about   400k - 500k RMB.
3. Why small unit? We only have $50k SGD on hand. Plus small unit   maybe easier to rent out to single professional.4. Downpayment needed about 30%. Therefore downpayment for an average 40 square meter   condo unit about 120k - 150k RMB which is about $24k - $30k SGD.Option 21. Shall we go ahead with the Bedok BTO flat? (We like the location very much as it   is next to Bedok Mall and opposite Bedok MRT). Capital gain from the new flat will   be much better as compare to other flat that is not near to mall and mrt.OPtion 31. Apply for another 4 room BTO in other location which cost around 280K. I believe   after selling our current 5 room flat in Woodlands. We should have enough cash for   other investment.Hope that the expert here will give us some advises. Thanks in advance!

Option 2
 
Go for this, best investment return
 
Forget about option 1, too risky
 
Option 3 - dont think u can get a better location than this, cheaper but may not be better

 
Thanks for your advise.
 
Option 1. Yes, there's alway some risk involve in investment. But we are buying the oversea property to rent out. The tenant will help us to pay off
the monthly installment.
 
Option 3. What i mean is getting another 4 room flat in different location so that we can cash out more cash after selling the Woodlands 5 room flat. Eg. Woodlands flat left $320k after levy and leftover bank loan. New BTO 4 room cost about $280k. HDB can grant us a loan of $150k. So we need to top up $130K after HDB loan. $320k - $130k = $190k cash on hand for other investment.

$50k you can forget about investing in real estate in China. No offence but the amount is too paltry.
 
My in laws own multiple properties in 2nd and 3rd tier cities in China. All studios or 2 bedders. The cheapest unit cost them in the region of $150k. 
 
I assume you and your wife don't hold jobs in China. How are you going to secure loans over there? Even if you do, the mortgage rate over there is about 5 times of ours currently.

Option 3 is to get another 4 room BTO flat in another location so that we can have more cash on hand after selling Woodlands 5 room
flat. Option 1 is to invest in oversea property as sg property are too expensive.
 
Option 2 should have sufficient facilities and amenities as the new flat is located next to Bedok Mall and just opposite Bedok MRT.
4rm bto flat in Bedok only $280k?
 
No, what i mean is getting another 4 room BTO in other location which cost around $280k like punngol, woodlands, yishun etc.

Hainan Dao was consider as 3rd tier city in china. My wife still holding on to her china passport and she's from Hainan Dao.
I haven't go and find out about that. All i know from internet was down payment needs 30%. Therefore we need china local bank to loan us the remaining 70%. We are looking for 2nd hand unit as basic renovation was done so that we can start to rent out to single professional.

Well first Hainan is a province. And Sanya and Haikou are most likely out of your budget. 
 
That leads to the second issue. Who are you going to rent to? Single professionals renting flats only exist in big cities. In small cities they are mostly local and stay with parents or have bought their own homes. Not everywhere is like Singapore that you can find herds of foreign tenants. 
 
The last issue is returns. We rented a 3 bedder at prime location at Haikou for $500 a months. That flat was also advertised for sale at about $400k. The return is tmd low..

You should do Option 3 then maybe you have cash for Option 1.  
 
The facilities and amenities are for the kid(s) if you intend to have any. 
I was looking around in Google Map, like not many primary school in that area.
 
My simple theory is
4 room have 3 bedrooms 
5 room also have 3 bedrooms.
A flat is a place to stay and Zzz'ing is a large part of the time.
The cost of the area occupied by Zzz'ing is in direct relation to the cost of the flat or place to stay.
Of course everyone is free to decide how much the Zzz'ing area will cost.

don't everything just look at $ and cts can? 
if you factor in the 面子 the wife receives from her relatives who realised that she had become a landlord
 
the returns are tmd tmd high

Yes, I agreed with what u said. We submit our application to try our luck. And we are lucky enough to have a chance to select a flat. We like the location very much as it is next to Bedok mall and just opposite mrt. This is for capital gains as we may consider selling it after 5 years. 
We are thinking of option 3 than option 1 also. But that new flat location is too good to give up. That's why I posted here and ask for some advises.

Haikou property has gone through cycles of bubble and crash. Very rollercoaster. Its good for speculator, bad for investor.  
We stayed there for a few months to decide and in the end threw our money elsewhere.

Hi all,
 
Needed some advices as me and my wife couldn't decide which way to go.
I shall tell my story in point form.
 
1. Currently living in a 5 room flat in woodlands.
2. Bank loan left 8 years to clear about $52K.
3. Applied for a 4 room BTO flat and was lucky enough to have slected a flat next
   to Bedok Mall and opposite Bedok MRT.
4. We had paid the the $2k option fee.
5. Pending to pay $52k(10% downpayment) + $15k(3% stamp fee). These 13% going to cost
    us about $67K.
6. We have $50k cash on hand. Another $15k from my wife CPF.
7. Wife just became PR 2 years ago. Therefore her CPF OA was little.
8. My CPF OA was used to service the bank loan of our current flat.
9. The amount was just enough to service the monthly loan.
10. New BTO flat in Bedok TOP 2021.
11. Selling our current Woodlands flat in 2021 need to pay HDB $50k levy.
12. Expected bank loan left around $30k in 2021.
13. I am using a safe amount to calculate. Let's say we only managed to sell our
	 Woodlands flat for $400k in 2021. Minus levy and leftover bank loan.
	 we can get back $320k from our Woodlands flat.
14. I knew out of the $320k that i get back. About half need to goes back to my
	 CPF OA. But these money that went back to CPF OA will be used to pay for our
	 New Bedok flat in 2021.
15. New flat left $470k after the downpayment. HDB able to grant us about $150k loan.
16. Therefore we have no problem for the new flat. We only need to save another
    $50k - $70k to renovate our new flat in 2021.
 
Option 1
 
1. Thinking of investing our $50k cash on hand on oversea property. Wife is from china
   Hainan Dao.
2. We are thinking of buying a small condo unit about 40 square meter that cost about
   400k - 500k RMB.
3. Why small unit? We only have $50k SGD on hand. Plus small unit
   maybe easier to rent out to single professional.
4. Downpayment needed about 30%. Therefore downpayment for an average 40 square meter
   condo unit about 120k - 150k RMB which is about $24k - $30k SGD.
 
Option 2
 
1. Shall we go ahead with the Bedok BTO flat? (We like the location very much as it
   is next to Bedok Mall and opposite Bedok MRT). Capital gain from the new flat will
   be much better as compare to other flat that is not near to mall and mrt.
 
 
OPtion 3
 
1. Apply for another 4 room BTO in other location which cost around 280K. I believe
   after selling our current 5 room flat in Woodlands. We should have enough cash for
   other investment.
 
Hope that the expert here will give us some advises. Thanks in advance!
 

You didnt share what you work as and what your monthly income is.
And mostly importantly, what are truly your objectives?  
Returns in the form of profits or in the form of improved lifestyle?
Finally, are you ready to lose it all and start all over again?

Another option for you.
 
1. Rent out your HDB
2. Buy a place in Hainan to stay
Renting out the whole unit without the owner living in it must get approval from HDB and it's very difficult to be approved. I don't wish to go by the left way and end up in trouble.
Haikou property has gone through cycles of bubble and crash. Very rollercoaster. Its good for speculator, bad for investor.

Ok, thanks for advice. Seems like quite a lot of guys recommended me to go for option 2. I shall kiv about buying a property in Haikou for the time being.

I work as a technician. We had a combined salary of $5500 after cpf per month. 
My main objective is to ask for advises about option 1, 2 or 3. 
 
I believed most people whom invested in property want to earn passive income to buy another property and another and another........
 
Invest in property won't lose all of my capital. It will have some value even when the property bubbles burst or financial crisis. The most we will hold on to it and wait patiently for the cycle to be up again.

Haikou is the most develop cities for the whole Hainan island which is about 50 times the size of sg. Good infrastructure, good medical facilities etc.

 
Haikou is almost like SG. The properties there in Haikou & Sanya about 60% more than any other provinces.
 
For your case, you are buying it since your wife is from Hainan Island. But to think of it, your that property would become a 'White' elephant unless you intended to migrate there to stay.  
 
Not trying to scare you but if you buy a property there and rented it out, who to collect the rent for you ? I belief it will be your wife family members. I have a few friends who just the same situation as you, brought houses there and in the end, instead of renting it out, Their in-laws stays there. Since it's your wife family, do you still wants to chase them out and risk having dispute with your wife ? 
 
There are so many horrid stories of properties invested taken over by relatives who refuse to shift out. You can't do anything and fighting a case to get your property back took years unless you know some 'big shot' of which, you have to spend under-table $$$$.
 
Think twice when investing oversea property unless you going to work there for years or retire there.
 
Keep that $50k for rainy days and it will become very handy when in need.
 
Reading your initial thread, you barely can get through after selling your current flat for a new BTO one. Wait until you have cash to spare, then you can look into investing oversea properties.
 
Just my thoughts and to invest or not still your final says ....

Haikou is almost like SG. The properties there in Haikou & Sanya about 60% more than any other provinces.
 
For your case, you are buying it since your wife is from Hainan Island. But to think of it, your that property would become a 'White' elephant unless you intended to migrate there to stay.  
 
Not trying to scare you but if you buy a property there and rented it out, who to collect the rent for you ? I belief it will be your wife family members. I have a few friends who just the same situation as you, brought houses there and in the end, instead of renting it out, Their in-laws stays there. Since it's your wife family, do you still wants to chase them out and risk having dispute with your wife ? 
 
There are so many horrid stories of properties invested taken over by relatives who refuse to shift out. You can't do anything and fighting a case to get your property back took years unless you know some 'big shot' of which, you have to spend under-table $$$$.
 
Think twice when investing oversea property unless you going to work there for years or retire there.
 
Keep that $50k for rainy days and it will become very handy when in need.
 
Reading your initial thread, you barely can get through after selling your current flat for a new BTO one. Wait until you have cash to spare, then you can look into investing oversea properties.
 
Just my thoughts and to invest or not still your final says ....   
very true, if cannot guarantee rental income, very likely will become a white elephant.  
sell also got problem if they keep building new apartments,  just like in msia.

I work as a technician. We had a combined salary of $5500 after cpf per month.
 
My main objective is to ask for advises about option 1, 2 or 3. 
 
I believed most people whom invested in property want to earn passive income to buy another property and another and another........
 
Invest in property won't lose all of my capital. It will have some value even when the property bubbles burst or financial crisis. The most we will hold on to it and wait patiently for the cycle to be up again.
bro...i throw in a scenario. Say you cant get tenants for your apartment.....how long can you tahan to service the mortgage without roi?

prepare to take on higher debt if cannot afford to put in more equity

Just my thoughts and to invest or not still your final says ....   
Hi picnic06, my father in law will collect the rent and help us to pay the monthly installment to bank if we really buy a small unit in Haikou. 
My parent in law has a land where they build a 4 storey house. That house has a total of 8 rooms. My parent in law lived in 1 room. And my wife's two younger brothers lived in another two rooms. They rented out the other 5 rooms to others. 
 
Therefore I don't think our small apartment will be used by them. The small apartment is solely for rental to help us build passive income.
 
We are not working in Haikou, but may consider retiring in Haikou.
 
Yes,$50k is not that big amount. We can't afford to buy another property in sg. That's why we are considering using that money for overseas property or for the down payment for our new BTO flat in Bedok. 
 
I am using a very safe figure of selling my Woodlands 5 room flat for $400k only. This current Woodlands flat is very near about 5 minutes walk to the Thomson line(Woodland south station). We won't know the future price but I think $400k is around there.
Buy sell Buy sell, not tired meh? How come 5rm in wdls only 400k?I am using a very safe figure to estimate the selling price of our 5 room Woodlands flat.
Who told you it is difficult to get approved? Have you lived there for 5 years already?
 
The approval is just a formality.
 
 
Cuz woodlands is a shit place lor.
I lived in that flat since 2003. Renting out the whole unit without owner living in that unit must have a very good valid reason for HDB for approval.  
We can't afford a private property in sg. Therefore we still don't dare to dream of that yet.

you all elite private property owners may not know but...
 
barring those few million dollar hdbs, hdb prices in general  now easily 20% down from the peak a few years ago

the only property that is a certain roi is your hdb......thats your bestest bet. Foreign property is abit suspect as most have huge land reserves. Why need to buy property when your wife has a family house with many rooms. I rather save up and buy land overseas if i have the means.

Thanks for your encouragement. We are still holding the ideas of buying a small apartment unit in Haikou.  
We may go for option 3. Gave up the Bedok BTO. Lose $2k option fee. Apply for another 4 room BTO that cost less maybe around $280k price range in punngol, Sembawang, woodlands, yishun etc. 
 
In doing so, we will have extra cash in hand maybe even for private property in sg.
 
Woodlands flat sell $400k.
After HDB levy and leftover bank loan
Still have $320k.
New 4 room flat in another location around $280k.
HDB grant us a loan of $150k. 
Therefore new flat need to top up $130k.
$320k - $130k = $190k cash.
 
This is the figure we got after doing the simple math. Are we correct? Or are we wrong?

I don't know how much you need to top up or HDB's loan rules but what kind of private property do you hope to buy with 190k in cash and a 150k loan? I did a quick calculation on propertyguru's calculator with an estimate on your age and salary and this is what you can buy.

Property prices all over the world will went up for sure. It's just a matter of time. Provided you can tahan than down turn.
 
About 10 years ago. The property price in Haikou has an average of 3k RMB per square metre($600 SGD) Now their property price is in the range of an average 8k RMB.

I just told you that this isn't true at all.
 
Where did you hear that you must have a very good valid reason?
Even if HDB approved us to rent out whole unit of our Woodlands flat. We still can't afford a private property in sg as of now.

nothing is more secured than cash in the bank for rainy day. I used to think like you bought a unit in malacca thinking can retire there one day. Didn;t even bother to rent the unit out.
 
After paying off the loan end up sit there for a few year and gave up. Reason is we will never go back after retirement cos there is nothing there we can relate to. End up sold the unit at the same price we bought but loss big time on exchange rate.

you forget about cpf interest rates that has to be returned to your account once you sell off your flat. Your calculation to simplistic.....i not agent but i wont count my profit that way should i sell off my unit. I must return nearly 80k-100k in accumulated interest should i sell.

I am sorry to said that parking cash in bank is an unwise way of saving money. Bank interest rates won't beat inflation rates. 
If we really need money for rainy days. Eg. If we are fortunate already have some overseas property. We can just sell off one unit or some to get cash. 
 
Again I need to apologize. Boleh land is totally different from China. With their open policy. The whole country is growing fast. And I had went to Haikou to see for myself. Haikou is growing rapidly. That's why we don't even think of investing in boleh land.

Your argument would be valid if you're talking about 5mil or even @enye's 700k. Dumping $$$ in the banks only makes the banks happy.
 
But 50k..... Surely you need 50k for liquidity/rainy day? How fast will you be able to sell off your overseas property and what if it happens during a downturn and your property has no equity in it?
 
Anyway, no need to apologize over here. It's your money. No one here will apologize if property prices double and you miss out on an opportunity.

$150k is probably crushed peanuts to many bosses here but its not free

You might already know. There is freehold property in boleh land, but in China all land and properties are technically owned by the CCP and are leased to you for up to 70 years, there are no freehold titles. Of course, the Chinese will tell you that the CCP will take good care of you (not as a foreigner though) and after 70 years, they will allow you to extend the lease with a "small fee" or in the most ideal case, CCP will even compensate you for "动迁" -- of course people are hopeful, which is driving property prices up even for very old property in good locations - similar to our leasehold properties here which those in Geylang Lor 3 recently experienced.

Your story too long winded. Let me summarize for you:
 
Current Flat - Woodlands
Sell at 400k, loan 80k = 320k available funds
 
Planned Flat - Bedok
Buy at 537k
 
-------------------------------------
ignoring other noise first, 
 
1) you want to liberate $50k in cash for a Ferrari, Sentosa cove bungalow, etc.
2) I highly recommend spare cash in hand for any problems, especially medical. Minimally please keep $20k (this will not support you long if you lose your job, but will cover most medical problems if you are subsidised, C class ward etc)
 
so after selling your flat, 320k - 50k - 20k = 250k balance
 
If you buy the Bedok flat at 537k - 250k balance = Loan 287k
 
looking at the HDB installment calculation your installment is $1551 per month
with income of $5500, your CPF (37%) should have about $2k per month, so installment should be ok
 
so changing to the Bedok flat is manageable
Debatable is how much capital gains you will make from 537k upwards
so if changing flat for better location/transport is ok - changing for hope of gains, maybe you should think further
 
----------------------------------
with 50k in hand, buying a property in China for 100k+ is not too bad
i am sure in the very long term (10-20 yrs), you will make some money just simply due to inflation at least
 
----------------------------------
the main risk is if you lose your job
then you will have 2 loans to service with outstanding liabilities of 300k plus
 
this point, no one can advise you anymore, because only you know best how skilled you are
how likely you can find another job
 
i think singapore wont die one, if you willing work as delivery driver, hard labour, 2 jobs type - still can make 3-4k a month
 
if you think losing your job wont be end of the world, and you are tough enough to work hard jobs. then i think you are good to go
 
can't always be too safe, and you have one advantage is that your wife is from China , so it is safer for you to invest in China than us Singaporeans. And i am willing to bet that the China growth is going to beat the Singapore growth story
 
--------------------------------
if i were to give you one advice, if you serious about building your assets in the long term
 
sell the Woodlands flat and buy a 3 room flat (why need a 5 room if you have no kids)
with the free cash , invest it better

Whatever is returned to CPF can be used for the new flat lor.
 
 
How old are the 2 of you?
Yes actually. Whatever money used in my current flat will return back to CPF plus interest. But we can also used that amount for our new flat. 
So let's calculate again. I have used $170k in CPF plus interest as of now.
After selling off Woodlands flat. Left $320 - $170k(CPF) = $150k cash.
 
New flat around $280k - $170k(CPF) = $110k. 
If HDB able to grant us a loan of around $80k. (Around 70%)
We need to pay $30k cash to complete the transaction. 
Therefore $150k - $30k = $120k cash on hand. 
 
Selling woodlands flat for $400k is just a safe figure. We might get more since Thomson line(Woodlands south station) is going to complete in 2019 if I am not wrong. We might fetch a higher price than $400k.

that is a big IF and even more far fetch than msia property. it seem to me your plan is only a preliminary thought without going throught thorough calculation and risk assessment.
 
Anyway i didn't buy the property for investment, my old man was staying there till he pass on.

Rental yield will be ok if there is a pool of expats who is willing to pay.
 
In fact, most ppl who invested in property in Beijing are looking at capital gain.
 
In HaiKou, i have doubt about expats pool.

Property is as liquid as cash in the bank, everyone knows that
Property sure to go up, everyone knows that.
Money in bank is stupid everyone knows that
The only way to go is leverage or else how to make money, everyone knows that

I am sorry to said that parking cash in bank is an unwise way of saving money. Bank interest rates won't beat inflation rates.
 
If we really need money for rainy days. Eg. If we are fortunate already have some overseas property. We can just sell off one unit or some to get cash. 
 
Again I need to apologize. Boleh land is totally different from China. With their open policy. The whole country is growing fast. And I had went to Haikou to see for myself. Haikou is growing rapidly. That's why we don't even think of investing in boleh land.
To be blunt, the property prices in china has already gone up many times especially in touristy hainan, perhaps haikou is still not too bad as compared to sanya thats all 
If there was a good time to buy, that has past 
 
2008/2009 was the best 
 
as other bros have pointed out, 50k is not alot in today's context
 
U need to set aside a sum of monthly for rainy days, say your monthly income is 5.5k, multiply that by 12 months, thats about 66k, a safe sum to keep in float

i buy things without taking into account my wife's salary (if working). Bought my flat and cars that way! If need to dip into her savings or need her to work to cover the costs i will never commit. 1 piece of advice for ts......dont be a slave to our needs and want.

Thanks all for the input. We knew $50k is not a lot of money. In fact this $50k will be used for the down payment of our new BTO Bedok flat if we decided to continue with the transaction. (Invest in a mature estate with mall beside and mrt just opposite will ensure capital gain) This is what I see the next 10-20 years is not a problem. Sg as a regional financial hub will continue import ft.
 
Otherwise, this $50k will be invested in a small apartment in Haikou(if we decided not to buy the Bedok flat) and we will work our way up. (Hopefully we can get a tenant and he/she is paying our mortgage loan for us.)
 
From our situation as of now. Saving another $50k will take us less than two years. As I mentioned in earlier post, me and wife depend on a single salary. Our other salary are 100% save up. But putting the money in bank is unwise. Therefore we think of investment. 
 
We don't like bonds,funds,stocks etc as the risk are much higher than investing in property. By the way the 10 year cycle may come any time. 
 
Even if after we invested our money and 10 year cycle came. Our have another half of our salary to service the mortgage loan. 
 
Yes, we might lost our job. I think getting a $3k job in sg is not a problem. (Eg. Be a bus driver,drive grab etc) I worked as taxi driver before. Taking home $3k after minus off all expenses like car rental and fuel is not a big problem.

Yes, property price in Haikou has already gone up a lot as compare to 10 years ago. 
Will the price remain the same for the next 10 years? The answer is no. Property prices all over the world will continue to go up. Of course there are some down turn here and there. But it is an upward trend overall.
 
I just quote some example. When my parent first bought their 3 room hdb flat in geylang. It only cost them $13k. And we sold it for $100k. After 20 plus year. 
 
Than we move to woodlands for 5 room flat. I am the sole owner of this flat as my parents don't wish to pay hdb levy. We got the flat for $190k. One of my friend said i siao. Bought a $190k 5 room in woodlands. Look at the price now. This flat going for at least $400k now. It's not a lot. Just 100% capital gain.
 
So the story is, if u think the price is very high and don't buy. Take a look at the price again after 10 years. U will regrets of not buying. Property price will not drop. It will appreciate.

Thanks for advice. We are fortunate to be able to save some money. Instead of letting it park inside bank and lose the value due to inflation. We decided to invest.  
We don't buy liabilities. We want assets. Of course by investing in another property, it may become our liabilities. But it may also become our assets also. I hope it's the latter way.

Hi all,
 
Needed some advices as me and my wife couldn't decide which way to go.
I shall tell my story in point form.
 
1. Currently living in a 5 room flat in woodlands.
2. Bank loan left 8 years to clear about $52K.
3. Applied for a 4 room BTO flat and was lucky enough to have slected a flat next
   to Bedok Mall and opposite Bedok MRT.
4. We had paid the the $2k option fee.
5. Pending to pay $52k(10% downpayment) + $15k(3% stamp fee). These 13% going to cost
    us about $67K.
6. We have $50k cash on hand. Another $15k from my wife CPF.
7. Wife just became PR 2 years ago. Therefore her CPF OA was little.
8. My CPF OA was used to service the bank loan of our current flat.
9. The amount was just enough to service the monthly loan.
10. New BTO flat in Bedok TOP 2021.
11. Selling our current Woodlands flat in 2021 need to pay HDB $50k levy.
12. Expected bank loan left around $30k in 2021.
13. I am using a safe amount to calculate. Let's say we only managed to sell our
     Woodlands flat for $400k in 2021. Minus levy and leftover bank loan.
     we can get back $320k from our Woodlands flat.
14. I knew out of the $320k that i get back. About half need to goes back to my
     CPF OA. But these money that went back to CPF OA will be used to pay for our
     New Bedok flat in 2021.
15. New flat left $470k after the downpayment. HDB able to grant us about $150k loan.
16. Therefore we have no problem for the new flat. We only need to save another
    $50k - $70k to renovate our new flat in 2021.
 
Option 1
 
1. Thinking of investing our $50k cash on hand on oversea property. Wife is from china
   Hainan Dao.
2. We are thinking of buying a small condo unit about 40 square meter that cost about
   400k - 500k RMB.
3. Why small unit? We only have $50k SGD on hand. Plus small unit
   maybe easier to rent out to single professional.
4. Downpayment needed about 30%. Therefore downpayment for an average 40 square meter
   condo unit about 120k - 150k RMB which is about $24k - $30k SGD.
 
Option 2
 
1. Shall we go ahead with the Bedok BTO flat? (We like the location very much as it
   is next to Bedok Mall and opposite Bedok MRT). Capital gain from the new flat will
   be much better as compare to other flat that is not near to mall and mrt.
 
 
OPtion 3
 
1. Apply for another 4 room BTO in other location which cost around 280K. I believe
   after selling our current 5 room flat in Woodlands. We should have enough cash for
   other investment.
 
Hope that the expert here will give us some advises. Thanks in advance!
 

 
iirc...whatever the profit margin from your selling....50% cash have to be put into the new buying unit price..

We don't like our money to be locked inside CPF. We can only own 1 HDB flat. With our status now, we don't dream of buying private.
