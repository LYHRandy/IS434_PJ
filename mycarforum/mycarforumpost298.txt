A FOUR-ROOM Queenstown HDB flat has sold for $653,000, setting a new record for price per sq ft (psf), amid continuing red-hot demand for resale flats.
 

The buyers, a male Indonesian permanent resident and a Singaporean woman, could have bought a condominium unit in an outlying area for the price.
 

But they were won over by the location, just five minutes walk from Queenstown MRT station, and on the top, 40th floor of the block, with unblocked views of greenery from all windows.
 

The four-year-old 969sqft unit at Forfar Heights, Strathmore Avenue, sold for $68,000 above valuation - a level determined by an independent valuer.
 

This works out to $674 psf, smashing the previous record of $609 psf, achieved in January last year, by about 10per cent.
 

This may be an unusually high price but resale prices have been moving up.

He have different definition. He is base on monthly installment which is 20% of income, totally ignoring the duration of loan, e.g 30yrs.
 

Last generation, affordable is can clear loan within 10-15yrs.

And valuations will start rising... and in turn new HDB prices will start rising.... and valuations will start rising again... and on and on and on...
 

They should just give 99 year loans instead... and change HDB into a landlord.

I think if you think about it there is some truth in what the minister is saying regardless whether we like it or not
 

ask yourself 

10 years ago how much does a bowl of noodle cost or even a can of coke cost

property prices have also increased

to demand that prices of hdb flat remains static for the past 10 to 20 years is both wishful thinking and unrealistic
 

there are flats still relatively cheap like in woodlands
 

the problem we face in singapore is not uniquely that of singapore but world wide
 

hence the bottom line is to live within one means

i am not trying to put down any profession

but property agents are really overpaid lot

why they get a commission for each property transaction but you read so often there are hiccups that the buyers or sellers need to handle themselves

1300 sq. ft.
 

3 bedrooms (Large master bedroom), 2 halls, (large main hall),  large kitchen, 2 bathrooms and toilets.
 

100 metres from MRT. All the reqd shopping and amenities just downstairs -  2 food centers, NTUC, Sheng Siong  supermart, bank, BigMac, polyclinic, dentists, doctors, primary and secondary schools, temple, open area for regular pasar malams/night markets. What else do you need? Next train stop to large shopping mall and large library.

The thing is they are very near city center, yours is so far up north, want to go orchard so far. And good view. Yours in khatib block 600+/800+? It's not how near to shops but how near to city.

With luck his 40th floor flat may end up on the first with the help of a good quake.
 

Dumb ass still doesn't understand. The only properties that does not depreciate are the freehold landed ones. 
 

Too bad most of us just cannot afford it.

You believe what the garmen say?

Singaporeans are suffering like mad and they don't do anything...

Of course the PRs can afford...they got the money mah...68k over valuation...the seller got a big payday liao lor..
 

I too have been looking for a flat as i'm also recently married....

So far all the COV i look at all about 40k...madness...why would they think that normal Singaporeans have that kind of hard cash to pay for the COV? If i had, you think i would still buy a HDB???
 

Looks like the garmen is chasing our own people out of our own country one day man..

Wan to live near city for what? Unless you work there makes sense.
 

If you don't work there, i think you will not go to orchard rd more than twice a month.

I don't go to orchard more than twice a month. 2 times is quite a lot liao. Nothing much there unless I really need to get something. Parking also expensive, take taxi also expensive, even worse take taxi home more troublesome. Walk every shopping malls all seems to have the same shops and brands.
 

Buy Queenstown near MRT for what? Wan to go orchard also must change at Cityhall first.
 

I live at SK, $300k ++, about 1500sqf. Front door facing river every morning and evening like looking at china's "Kwei Lin" like that when it fog up. Nearby building water sports facilities some more. Opposite wet market with two aircon food court and provision shops. Mac, KFC, 7-11, Clinics, Toto, NTUC. Take LRT one stop got Daiso. Take LRT 3 stops go Compasspoint. Bot a small car. KPE just nice ready when I shifted in after 1 year. Now to Suntec is 12 mins. To Orchard is 20 mins.
 

That guy never do his research anyhow buy.

But still not worth $600+k.
 

I will rather spend $300+k on a unit (based on that price, still can get one with good transport connections) and the remainder, can consider buying a $50k car. With the excess of $300k, can buy 6 $50k cars = 60 years to drive around. Which HDB flat is standing around for 60 years?

You are staying at Blk 838 to 848. It's worth about 430~450k now, price not too far away against the record breaker, consider it's a 22~23 years flat against 5 years old.
 

From Khatib to Orchard is about the same timing as from Queenstown to Orchard. (both less than 20 mins)

HDB Resale Prices
 

Look at this 4rm flat (3yr old) in Toa Payoh that was transacted in October 2009... It was sold for 600.8k WT#$##@$$#@
 

Toa Payoh is a good place.. 3 stops to Orchard... The place where i am staying is 7mins to TPY MRT, 6 min to Braddell MRT and 7 mins to Caldecott Station (which will house Circle and Thomson line).. All these within walking distance.. heehee
 

covered and sheltered walk way to TPY. If taking direct path, it only 5 mins walk to TPY MRT...
 

I am glad I bought a unit at the peak ^^

It doesn't matter. The problem here is with all the kiasu owners staying around there, when they see this kind of transaction prices, they will also want. So everyone who are selling their flats will now ask for $60k above valuation. One after another will do that. Other estates see liao also become greedy and follow suit. Then condo owners see liao also buay tahan, ask for higher prices as well. End up prices gets pushed up higher and higher. Many buyers who pay this kind of insane prices are not locals but PRs or foreigners/investors. It's the lower and middle income groups that will suffer.
 

I've come across a few cases where buyers are not able to get sufficient loan from banks because the property is valued at only say $600k by the bank but the seller is asking for $800k. Last time whe I bought my condo, valuation is the same as selling price. We are slowly following the footsteps of HK and Japan. Soon we may have to take 60 year loans over 2 generations.

When i bought my present HDB in 2005, i make sure it is walking distance from MRT... Those were the times when not many PR flooding the market.... can just walk in and select from HDB
 

Bot my flat in Sembawang for $300k, 15 th floor, 150 metre from Sembawang MRT, direct from HDB. Original was $380k. At that time NOBODY want to buy Exec flat, so HDB lower down the price, just my luck. Btw my flat 142 square metre...

the current price for EXEC in Sembwang is about 400k now... places like AMK are hit 700k, for a similar age and size... and they are further away from MRT station compared to yours...
 

reason why people want Bishan, Toa Payoh, Ang Mo Kio is there are lots of good schools ard.. Just like Toa Payoh, u can take a short bus ride to where all the good schools are in Bukit Timah... heehee...
 

i staying in AMK.. close to Ai Tong, St Nicholas, Catholic High, Anderson Sec, Anderson JC, RI, NYP... its endless.. that's why my current flat is still worth damn lot of money... for my current unit in AMK, its about the price of a EXEC in sembawang.. =x

well, i dun really bother.. coz i never wanted to stay in jurong west.. all i wanted is to stay in central.. Bishan - TPY - Ang Mo Kio.. Call me #@$#$#@ but its the accessible to places, schools and etc... imagine staying in woodlands... err... what good schools are there in woodlands? no punt intended... 
 

cheers... the reason why Jurong West is populated is due to influx of FT... the price of JW is still comparatively cheaper.. Try asking them to buy a unit in the golden triangle of Singapore..  cut throat prices...
 

its like that... those "ulu" prices rise, the "prime" locations will rise too.. heehee.. thanks to FT..
 

i dun recall TPY 4 room flats can be sold for 600k... and it did in Oct 2009... what's next?

They want lots of cash from their buyers. They want high prices for their flats.
 

Talk about lowering flat prices.. the sellers are giving crap reasoning.. black faces..
 

At the end money have to come from somewhere right... from the goverment ? dream on....

All the reqd shopping and amenities just downstairs -  2 food centers, NTUC, Sheng Siong  supermart, bank, BigMac, polyclinic, dentists, doctors, primary and secondary schools, temple, open area for regular pasar malams/night markets. What else do you need? Next train stop to large shopping mall and large library.
 

Any offers?



 

Actually, I stay in the same estate as the 653k flat and I must say that we don't really have much facilities around here. But I don't think your 1300 sq ft Yishun flat can fetch this price either, simple reason being Yishun is the cheapest estate in the whole of Singapore. Not that it's not good, it's just too far up north and some people like the convenience of proximity. Here, I can drive to Orchard within 5-7min and reach Raffles Place by MRT within 15min. Yishun? Reach city centre wanna sleep already loh.

Maybe a sub prime will be what Singapore needs for everyone to wakeup. Its just like war, although it is a bad thing, but sometimes its necessary just like US in WW2.



 
 

oooh, a subprime like case in singapore would be cool.

yishun is nice. my aunt used to stay in a jumbo flat next to the reservoir. super nice.

the living room is considered spacious for a flat. then somemore the living room got 3 stairs up then is the dining place (facing the reservoir) turn left is the kitchen walk straight is a corridor that leads to the rooms.
 

thats the only flat i like in the WHOLE of singapore.

yeah, that's why i bought the peak!



 

punggol sengkang is so different now, have you ever been there? toa payoh is full of traffic jam pineapple jam, even got ERP over there. Too crowded la. Why still stuck with those stupid mentality. I remember when our family moved to Tampines 20 over years ago, people say Tampines is like a piece of wasteland, but look what isi it now.

Last time when my parents bought their jumbo flat in Woodlands, only $185K. The flat is 192 sqm big. 7-8mins walk to Woodlands MRT. Now got people offering them more than half a mil, they also don't want to sell.

Actually staying at suburb areas are good in the sense that the surrounding id better, better air quality, less noise unlike Toa payoh, so busy and so noisy. But Bukit Timah is different, that place is quiet and serene. But how many can afford.

actually depends on ur preference and also ur work location. finding a central location is flexible as going by public transport or car the average distance cover is smaller say than a extreme west ,north or east location.
 

also even though now like u stay in west and near ur work place but what about ur wife? she may work in east, then when u fetch her, it covering 2x distance from east to west. and who is to say u will not change job to extreme east, do u then move to extreme east? moving house is no joke esp when u also get new job.
 

actually myself still very public transport oriented, so i my choice is still get a flat near E-W line mrt stn but not the extreme station, i dun like to take feeder bus or lrt or change line, very tiring....
 

i ever live in extreme west and work in extreme east, lasted quite a few yrs, dat time younger and still can tahan, the waiting for feeder bus, then go mrt, then change feeder bus to industrial estate...wow...really wake up earfly and by time reach office quite tired...

well, stupid or not.. that's subjective... but look at tampines, its 5 room flat is still very affordable at 400+k.. it hasn't picked up to the point at the golden triangle place.. where its 500-600+k... 
 

doesn't matter.. we live in singapore.. everyone is like that.. ERP doesn't even affect me.. it affects singaporeans who intend to cheat the system by using Toa Payoh as a bypass.. if you do not know, please dun anyhow comment...
 

to me, tampines is just like another woodlands, jurong west... to me, location is everything.. okie? happy? i am happy! heehee...
 

if those suburban locations ever rise to the price of prime locations... then dun worrie.. those prime locations will rise even higher...
 

just look @ Queenstown... @ Pinnacle Duxton @ The Peak @ Natural Loft @ Park Central @ City View... 
 

They are almost sold out.. :) but then buyers are still willing to buy...
 

I am not prepared to fork out 400+k for places like Seng Kang / Punggol... i would rather top up another 100k to get better locations in the golden triangle...

talking about Toa Payoh? noisy? then look at Pinnacle@Duxton.. its even more noiser!!! but then look at the demand..
 

people are willing to pay 640k for a 5 room flat direct from HDB.. its not even DBSS... well, different people different perspectives.. to each of his own.. :)

ya, always drive to there.. dun like the place... ^^ i still like AMK-Bishan-Toa Payoh.. reason being, i grew up here.. Its where many good schools are located and yet so near to town.. that itself is a strong reason.. period 
 

some people prefer pinnacle @ duxton.. well, i dun work in the city... so no point for me to live in P@D... haha..

fully agree with your statement.. that's why i still decided to buy the peak in consideration that i can't always drive my entire family around.. say when i am working and etc..

yeah these days, most are 99 yr leasehold.. unless you talk about those super prime condos, landed (district 9 and etc) or those super duper ulu.. like changi area, then perhaps still freehold... ^^
 

look at centro @ amk.. 1250psf... $#@$#@$#@
 

trevista @ tpy... 1000psf $#$#@$#@$#@
 

but your dad's penthouse might just return investment of that for the 4room flat in queenstown.. a whopping 250%!!!!  if the IR is really a hit.. ^^

There are penty of rich Indo chinese visiting spore. Mt.E is flooded with them. 
 

No surpirse if one of them come splash $ for a lousy pigeon hole. 
 

Look at the living hall........so god damn small!!!! Probably kena block by surrounding cond bldgs. Got height but no view. 



 

I've been to this flat with the same layout on the 40th floor, I was there to check out the carpetary work of the carpenter whom IM  evaluating if I shd engage. The living room is certainly small but still ok it is the 2 common room that shock me, usually newly built HDB r known to b small, but these 2 common room is ridiculously small so small that after installing a 3 door cupboard, there is pratically no room to even place a super single bed, well can put one but that's its no place to walk at all, i stand there wonder how they going to place their most basic furniture decently? it is a challenge, i tell u unless all custom made, no ready made furniture (i.e. that's a single size bed and a wardrode) can fit in... it is that small.... wat they r paying it really only for the location and the 40th storey  no wonder the previous owner move out...too small to start a family

Telok blangah is a great area but it is a small town unlike amk or tp. Telok Blangah is quiet n peaceful, and back by mt faber and telok blangah hill park, with the current park extension program , resident in that area can go trekking anytime they like from mt faber to clementi, near sentosa if u like the beach yet it is near both orchard n CBD area, there's good sch like river valley n radin mas ... so convenient...shiok...  This is one of the HDB area which I think is really good.

quiet and peaceful is one thing.. accessible is another thing.. dun forget if you have children.. are you going to drive them everytime they go out.. zzz... that's enough for me...

Please Simei Parc Lumeire also sold out fast, even faster than the peak. And they are not cheap consider the location. Why? good living envirnment do play a part with regards to where people stay.
 

And yes, to each of his own. I believe in your feeling for Toa Payoh as you grew up there. Like I will always feels good staying in Tampines, but new homes there hard to come by. So, Northeast is the most familiar area.

that's my exact sentiment.. even though Harbour Front MRT is some where in the vincinity.. but its definitely not walkable distance.. might need to take 1hr to reach.. =x
 

i believe most of us here have transport.. but would ur wife have transport, would ur children have transport... err.. i think i have hit the nail on the head..

i mean we can't always be there for them, 24/7... like daddy.. i am going to be home late.. can u come and fetch me? coz telok blangah heights very ulu... no bus, no mrt nearby.. and need to walk long distance from the super duper far bus stop from the main road...

I believe you just want to remind yourself that buying The Peak is right. I don't think it's wrong, but it is wrong to say that punggol Sengkang area is no good. Who the hell that earns below 8K is able to get themselves a unit at the peak. Only those 2nd time buyers I think. So it doesn't mean that others can afford such expensive location.

i guess you are right.. many people been telling me its too expensive.. but then i have been monitoring HDB new release...
 

In the October Balloting Sale (its oversubscribed by 10 to 1 ratio)
 



New 5 Room Flats Direct from HDB

- AMK 540k (19th storey)

- TPY 600k (39th storey)

- Queenstown 620k (39th storey)

- Pinnacle @ Duxton 643k (49th storey)
 

I am not blowing up the figures.. talking about market crashing.. HDB is the monopoly here... we are simply at its mercy... and TP@TPY i bought is ~600k... and its low floor at 22 storey (117sqm)... so still alright to me.. considering it has condo-finishing... 
 

no major rennovation needed... doors done, flooring (tiles and timber flooring) done, built in cabinets done, kitchen fully done, toilets fully done.. 4 daikin invertor aircons done... lighting points and etc all done.. 
 

err.. if one simply dun want to renovate, just fix lighting, buy furniture.. can move in liaoz

Don't talk about crash or no crash la, you bought your house to stay and end up getting so paranoid over this kind of issue is bad for health la. When you get your key to your new house, everything people say will be forgotten.

actually, what i am experiencing through now is what some of my seniors went through in 2004.. when they bought Pinnacle @ duxton.. 5 room was going for a top price for 450k.. now the top 5 room at the same location has rose to 643k.. those who were telling them too expensive now diam diam..
 

i told others.. come on.. i intend to stay in the golden triangle.. the resale are not cheap, or even more expensive... HDB direct are priced almost at the same price, worst still no furnishing.. when i told them about the finishing is close to condo.. they diam diam liaoz.. they din expect it to be furnish even with aircons, cooking hubs and etc...
 

of coz TV, fridge not provided lah.. else whatever condo has for its furnishing, DBSS will also has.. but of coz NOT marble flooring lah.. but bedrooms are timber flooring.. good enough ^^
 

the reason why i commit now is HDB flats seem to be heading north and never seem to be coming down. MBT says our flats are affordable.. diaoz! then i quick, fast hand fast leg, bought a unit @ TP.. Now TP no quota for chinese liaoz.. quite incredible feat. considering it has 1202 units...
 

3room fully sold - cheapest is 340k

4 room fully sold - cheapest ard 450k

5 room - sorrie no quota for chinese...
 

you are right, i buy it as a home, not as an investment.

I don't go to orchard more than twice a month. 2 times is quite a lot liao. Nothing much there unless I really need to get something. Parking also expensive, take taxi also expensive, even worse take taxi home more troublesome. Walk every shopping malls all seems to have the same shops and brands.
 

Buy Queenstown near MRT for what? Wan to go orchard also must change at Cityhall first.
 

I live at SK, $300k ++, about 1500sqf. Front door facing river every morning and evening like looking at china's "Kwei Lin" like that when it fog up. Nearby building water sports facilities some more. Opposite wet market with two aircon food court and provision shops. Mac, KFC, 7-11, Clinics, Toto, NTUC. Take LRT one stop got Daiso. Take LRT 3 stops go Compasspoint. Bot a small car. KPE just nice ready when I shifted in after 1 year. Now to Suntec is 12 mins. To Orchard is 20 mins.
 

That guy never do his research anyhow buy.



 

I think you all lacks geographical sense  . Take a map out and draw a straight line.
 

Going from Queenstown to Orchard only takes you less than 5 minutes by car or bus. You can never achieve this timing if you stay in kampong and outskirt area like SK, Yishun, tampines and boon lay. Dont take MRT which takes a big round and is not be the shortest distance route.

I drove everyday same route by Tanglin Road to Orchard if traffic smooth less than 5 min achievable from Queenstown. If you say toa payoh to orchard is 9min, I dont think queentown to orchard is 5min is nothing exagerating at all

Location is measured by distance from city center, not by type of transport. 
 

And in this case, the MRT route take one big round picking up people from difference area before going to Orchard. And thats why the big difference between car/bus and MRT here.

Many FTs, while working here, are buying resale flats as investment.  Many of them rent  their spare rooms to their colleagues. 
 

Flats are so expensive nowadays and yet salary remains the same.  I don't know how our kids are going to afford a flat in future.  They might end up renting the flats from the FTs.

HDB flats (public) are meant for citizens, and now many citizens are not able to buy flats of their choice cos of the high price (believed to be propped up by FTs), so how ?? HDB will welcome this people as it increases their coffers. so normal peasants just have to lan lan suck thumb lor ...

Telok blangah is a great area but it is a small town unlike amk or tp. Telok Blangah is quiet n peaceful, and back by mt faber and telok blangah hill park, with the current park extension program , resident in that area can go trekking anytime they like from mt faber to clementi, near sentosa if u like the beach yet it is near both orchard n CBD area, there's good sch like river valley n radin mas ... so convenient...shiok...  This is one of the HDB area which I think is really good.



 
 

let me correct you on the location of river valley high school. the current location at telok blangah area is only a holding campus.. Its permanent campus is currently built in boon lay.. then it will move over when its completed... then u tell me lah.. what good schools left in telok blangah.. =x no punt intended..

true, but then you must think of the other 60% who doesn't have private transport.. i was looking at the MRT system.. shiok manz! when the circle line, thomson line and downtown lines are completed... one would really appreciate the convenience of staying in toa payoh...
 

and dun talk about buses... geez... they are unpredictable and always jam packed with people.. though its the same for MRT...
 

The Peak @ Toa Payoh ^^
 

now i can appreciate why everyone WANTS to stay in toa payoh despite being very packed.. Best of all, government already has committed to renewing the town as written in the press.. no like some towns like hougang, potong pasir.. sorrie no punt intended again..

He have different definition. He is base on monthly installment which is 20% of income, totally ignoring the duration of loan, e.g 30yrs.
 

Last generation, affordable is can clear loan within 10-15yrs.

I think my flat in Yishun beats that one any day.
 

1300 sq. ft.
 

3 bedrooms (Large master bedroom), 2 halls, (large main hall),  large kitchen, 2 bathrooms and toilets.
 

100 metres from MRT. All the reqd shopping and amenities just downstairs -  2 food centers, NTUC, Sheng Siong  supermart, bank, BigMac, polyclinic, dentists, doctors, primary and secondary schools, temple, open area for regular pasar malams/night markets. What else do you need? Next train stop to large shopping mall and large library.
 

Any offers?



 

100 metres from MRT? Are you staying at blk 748/749/750 or 80x series? If not it is not 100 metres from MRT

I can count the number of times per year I go Orchard with just 1 hand  
 

Orchard is not the only place to shop, unless you are the type of person who like to be in "happening" place and enjoy crowded places. And really some retailers in Orchard are not really making money. The ones that are is at Jurong Point. Some of you who never been there should check out that place. Full of FTs 
 

For those who stay in SK/Punggol and drivers somemore using KPE, if you are smart enough you should know who to vote for in the coming election, especially since the government already standby ERP at KPE and can turn on anytime. They already have this intention when they build the gantry together with KPE if not they are just wasting tax payers money so I dont see why sk and punggol residents should give face and decide who to vote. Moreover NE line under SBS is more expensive than other lines(not sure about circle line) so if you are residents there, should be able to see through what the government is trying to do, encourage more to move there and squeeze money out from you all.

You are staying at Blk 838 to 848. It's worth about 430~450k now, price not too far away against the record breaker, consider it's a 22~23 years flat against 5 years old.
 

From Khatib to Orchard is about the same timing as from Queenstown to Orchard. (both less than 20 mins)

Many feeling very shitty in the past few years, it will boil over at the rate we are going.............

from queenstown can go orchard rd in 20 mins in peak hr.
 

what about going home ? you will be stuck in a jam for 1/2 hr more.
 

no body wants punggol sengkang flats which is why there are so many buying resale and govt try to play games by releasing slowly and at low price



 

The price of flats at Sengkang and especially Punggol are not cheap at all considering the location. Punggol flats resale prices are even higher than Sengkangs'. This is how government do to hold the price up for Punggol in order to make Punggol attractive, other than building nice nice design. Yes the price take into consideration the age of the flat but I feel the price is too artificially maintained.

145  	 Lor 2 Toa Payoh  	36 to 40  	92.00

Model A 	2006 	$600,800.00
 

HDB Resale Prices
 

Look at this 4rm flat (3yr old) in Toa Payoh that was transacted in October 2009... It was sold for 600.8k WT#$##@$$#@
 

Toa Payoh is a good place.. 3 stops to Orchard... The place where i am staying is 7mins to TPY MRT, 6 min to Braddell MRT and 7 mins to Caldecott Station (which will house Circle and Thomson line).. All these within walking distance.. heehee
 

covered and sheltered walk way to TPY. If taking direct path, it only 5 mins walk to TPY MRT...
 

I am glad I bought a unit at the peak ^^



 

I dont consider the Peak near MRT at all. Definitely not 5 mins to TPY MRT. Walkable distance yes but when you reach a certain age, only 1 min and 100 metres to MRT is consider walkable distance  
 

The food at nearby hawker centre is nice. Got wet market somemore. So The Peak has its attraction. The only thing that really lose out in my opinion is MSCP. Even the place where I am staying is basement carpark. It will be more condo-like for the Peak. But all in all Toa Payoh is a good location to stay. If I am someone who keep changing jobs or need to travel on the job, I will choose Toa Payoh.

okie lah.. its 400m away... taking into consideration i have done the actual walking.. its 5 min walk.. even when i use google map, it also tallies... 400m - 5min walk...
 

too near TPY centre also very noisy.. heehee.... i was looking at the circle line.. wow.. next time go to NUS only 8 stations away.. and its direct at kent ridge MRT, at NUS area.. swee!! 
 

in toa payoh, we have three direct lines..
 

N-S Line

Circle Line

Thomson Line
 

Not forgetting one more station away from Caldecott station, we will have downtown line... swee swee....
 

I did my walking...
 

Walking Distance

Braddell -7 mins

Toa Payoh - 5 mins

Caldecoot Station - 8 mins... 
 

worth it lah.. considering i can't possibly always be ahmat to my family members... u get my drift.. bleah!

My previous 2 HDB house, both need to take feeder service... really pain in the ass.... sometimes u have to wait nearly 20 minutes... remember those days. Just waste bloody of time. When i bought my present HDB in 2005, i make sure it is walking distance from MRT... Those were the times when not many PR flooding the market.... can just walk in and select from HDB
 

Bot my flat in Sembawang for $300k, 15 th floor, 150 metre from Sembawang MRT, direct from HDB. Original was $380k. At that time NOBODY want to buy Exec flat, so HDB lower down the price, just my luck. Btw my flat 142 square metre...

maybe i was too fast to jump into conclusions.. but compared to AMK-Bishan-TPY.. the good schools and higher levels of institutions are endless.. 
 

including primary, secondary, JCs and poly... 
 

that's why the golden triangle remains in great demand...

the current price for EXEC in Sembwang is about 400k now... places like AMK are hit 700k, for a similar age and size... and they are further away from MRT station compared to yours...
 

reason why people want Bishan, Toa Payoh, Ang Mo Kio is there are lots of good schools ard.. Just like Toa Payoh, u can take a short bus ride to where all the good schools are in Bukit Timah... heehee...
 

i staying in AMK.. close to Ai Tong, St Nicholas, Catholic High, Anderson Sec, Anderson JC, RI, NYP... its endless.. that's why my current flat is still worth damn lot of money... for my current unit in AMK, its about the price of a EXEC in sembawang.. =x



 

You can ask those staying at Bishan especially those who bought their flat in the mid 90s and they will tell you they bought there because of good school there. You can also ask them at what prices they bought too   But it is still ok if one is buying to stay but if they buy to invest   good luck to them.

5 room Toh Guan in Jurong East for examply now selling half million. U cant get 4 room for 325k or less in woodlands/ sembawang/yishun
 

my sis bot 4 room for 310k near Admiralty MRT in Mac (when all the prediction how bad the economy was), just last month my fren sold her 4 room in Admiralty for 30k more....crazy market.
 

4-5 years ago nobody want to stay in Jurong West, go and check the price now... u will be very SURPRISE...



 

Yah its a crazy market out there. The only advice I can give for 1st timer is buy direct from HDB. You can never go wrong with that under such current market.

well, if one is buying for staying.. no issue, as long as one can afford it.. but nothing to say if they are buying for investment... for me, i dun like bishan...

my current place in amk is good too.. but i would like to move to toa payoh...

i said again if such surburban areas can command such premium... no worries the prime locations will pick up as well. when its no longer attractive to buy a unit in the surburban...
 

i was considering.. 400+k to buy a new flat in punggol / seng kang or 500+k to buy a new flat in toa payoh.. considering its DBSS.. i fast hand fast leg committed to the peak.

Actually, I stay in the same estate as the 653k flat and I must say that we don't really have much facilities around here. But I don't think your 1300 sq ft Yishun flat can fetch this price either, simple reason being Yishun is the cheapest estate in the whole of Singapore. Not that it's not good, it's just too far up north and some people like the convenience of proximity. Here, I can drive to Orchard within 5-7min and reach Raffles Place by MRT within 15min. Yishun? Reach city centre wanna sleep already loh.



 

I consider Forfar Heights as one of the better designs SERs in Queenstown. Very nice and serene precinct. Facilities used have alot but Queenstown is going to have a big renewal soon with Dawson BTO coming up. I believe they will keep the NTUC and in fact the cinema too. Even the library they will also keep because opened by MM Lee. The rest most likely will go.

my prediction.. Dawson
 

4 room starts from 450k

5 room starts from 540k...
 

just look at the SERS in AMK... siao siao...
 

such prices, might as well buy DBSS... no need renovation liaoz... even with free kitchen, toilets, aircons, cabinets and etc...

absolutely  i like yishun, esp flats around north pt is great, it is matured estate with lotsof greenery and amenities avail.
 

the area is still undervalued, i see gems to be bot at very good prices, hope it dun appreciate too fast so i can wait til my 5 yrs up and sell my flat to buy a resale there.
 
 

only thing is convincing my other half as she thinks there is incovenient since only link by sle 



 

There are reasons why Yishun is undervalued and one of them I believe is because of the poor construction quality, especially those build in the early 80s to mid 80s. If you want you can compare those in blk 2xx/3xx/7xx series and compare with blk 8xx series. Can see the difference in quality. That time the minister in charge for National Development in the 80s Teh Cheang Wan. 
 

Another thing to note, since you are interested in Yishun is, those under AMK GRC, which is 8xx series and under Yishun Central/East. Price range can see the difference too.

Last time when my parents bought their jumbo flat in Woodlands, only $185K. The flat is 192 sqm big. 7-8mins walk to Woodlands MRT. Now got people offering them more than half a mil, they also don't want to sell.



 

Blk 8xx? Seen before and it is really big.

i also stay in woodlands... the jumbo here are so darn huge... once i visited me fren in block 8** almost got lost in the 240sq m jumbo...lots of walls...haha... if i have the money i oso want to get a jumbo... i guess no amount of money can make me sell a Jumbo too!!
 

Woodlands is accessible to BKE (PIE), SLE (CTE)...you can go anywhere you want if you have a car la...
 

taking MRT is also good at the very least you can board the train during peak hours...the moment you reach Yishun...commuters can forget about boarding the first train they see...
 

SMRT is the main operator for buses here...they are fast and efficient...they drive fast too...it's really convenient and you can go almost anywhere you want from Woodlands Bus interchange...

actually i stay very near town. even i own my own transport, i still take bus to town  haha
 

even in peak hour, all da way jam, i think at most 20mins. same timing as car. 
 

but for car, reach there need to find parking, pay erp. by the time i settle down, an extra 10mins is spent. become 30mins. in the end, bus still faster and cheaper LOL
 

talking about town.. this year i have not been to orchard, yet.

fully agree with your statement.. that's why i still decided to buy the peak in consideration that i can't always drive my entire family around.. say when i am working and etc..



 

And let your family suffer walking to MRT?  
 

If you say the Peak is near MRT, not really. But say its far from MRT, also not really coz really walkable to MRT. So therefore neither here nor there

another area which will go up very quick. Telok Blangah Rise,Heights,Drive etc. 
 

less than 500m to AYE, 1km to CTE and ECP. 15mins bus ride to orchard in non peak hours. drive? probably 5 mins! 
 

walking distance to vivocity, sentosa.



 

If only the weather here in Singapore is sub 20 degree and less humid. Definitely anywhere is walkable distance

let me correct you.. would u prefer to stand for 10-15 min... than to sit for 45 mins just to get to town?
 

oops... sorrie to be crude...
 

driving... then try saying that to my friends who always felt staying in woodlands is macchiam like living in JB if they want to travel to town...

I've been to this flat with the same layout on the 40th floor, I was there to check out the carpetary work of the carpenter whom IM  evaluating if I shd engage. The living room is certainly small but still ok it is the 2 common room that shock me, usually newly built HDB r known to b small, but these 2 common room is ridiculously small so small that after installing a 3 door cupboard, there is pratically no room to even place a super single bed, well can put one but that's its no place to walk at all, i stand there wonder how they going to place their most basic furniture decently? it is a challenge, i tell u unless all custom made, no ready made furniture (i.e. that's a single size bed and a wardrode) can fit in... it is that small.... wat they r paying it really only for the location and the 40th storey  no wonder the previous owner move out...too small to start a family



 

Flats that are under SERs are usually build without spending too much brain cells to design and think about the requirements. But seriously speaking Forfar Heights has got one of the better exterior looking precinct than others in Queenstown.

you really best liaoz.. 400m u still say far.. then current your place is how near to MRT? punt intended.. heehee.. if you dun know how to walk, let kor kor guide u okie.. this is the direct path.. 5 mins.. if you take the fully sheltered path to Toa Payoh MRT... which zig zag across the interconnecting blocks.. its  8mins...
 


 

i think for you, you should look at living in the MRT.. very near. dun even need to walk... lol 

can't be bothered, coz i have shown u the figures.. and i tried before 5 mins is all i need... normal walking somemore...
 

just for ur info, the bus stop outside blk 154 is the opening for underground linking to MRT station... which is just <1 min walk... err.. should i say escalator and some 30 steps?
 

haha.. i am beginning to love toa payoh even more now..

Telok blangah is a great area but it is a small town unlike amk or tp. Telok Blangah is quiet n peaceful, and back by mt faber and telok blangah hill park, with the current park extension program , resident in that area can go trekking anytime they like from mt faber to clementi, near sentosa if u like the beach yet it is near both orchard n CBD area, there's good sch like river valley n radin mas ... so convenient...shiok...  This is one of the HDB area which I think is really good.



 

The government will revitalise the place soon with the IR at Sentosa coming up soon. MRT will also be coming soon but exactly where no idea yet. Agree that the place is very quiet and serene which I like too.

I believe you just want to remind yourself that buying The Peak is right. I don't think it's wrong, but it is wrong to say that punggol Sengkang area is no good. Who the hell that earns below 8K is able to get themselves a unit at the peak. Only those 2nd time buyers I think. So it doesn't mean that others can afford such expensive location.



 

And also trying to justify to the rest of us

i guess you are right.. many people been telling me its too expensive.. but then i have been monitoring HDB new release...
 

In the October Balloting Sale (its oversubscribed by 10 to 1 ratio)
 



New 5 Room Flats Direct from HDB

- AMK 540k (19th storey)

- TPY 600k (39th storey)

- Queenstown 620k (39th storey)

- Pinnacle @ Duxton 643k (49th storey)
 

I am not blowing up the figures.. talking about market crashing.. HDB is the monopoly here... we are simply at its mercy... and TP@TPY i bought is ~600k... and its low floor at 22 storey (117sqm)... so still alright to me.. considering it has condo-finishing... 
 

no major rennovation needed... doors done, flooring (tiles and timber flooring) done, built in cabinets done, kitchen fully done, toilets fully done.. 4 daikin invertor aircons done... lighting points and etc all done.. 
 

err.. if one simply dun want to renovate, just fix lighting, buy furniture.. can move in liaoz  



 

Dont worry too much about the figures. If you are buying it to stay, you will not care so much about the figures. You should care more on how much and how long you need to pay for your loan installment if you are taking loan.

20 yrs... interest incurred 120k.. its not little but still manageable...
 

i have had friends who took default HDB loan 90%, over 30 yrs.. the interest incurred is a whopping 270k.. and the prices we paid for our pigeon hole is roughly the same...

What do you mean too exagerating? You mean going from Toa Payoh to orchard can be achieved in 5 min?
 

I drove everyday same route by Tanglin Road to Orchard if traffic smooth less than 5 min achievable from Queenstown. If you say toa payoh to orchard is 9min, I dont think queentown to orchard is 5min is nothing exagerating at all



 

Depends on which part of Queenstown. If it is Alexander road then 5 mins is achievable.

Sure. I walked from blk 142 to MRT before so I know. Walkable distance yes but I dont consider that as near MRT. And I dont think is 5 mins. Too many people like to claim 5 mins etc when they havent even take into account time taken to go into the station.

Oh forgot to answer your question. Mine is 150 metres from MRT. And 1 min to 1and half min including take lift from my house, walk abit and then take escalator down to MRT   I dont need to cross any road or carpark to reach MRT. Let me give you examples of what I mean by near MRT. For example I mentioned 748/749/750 or even 751/752 at Yishun, those are near Yishun MRT. Khatib is Blk 80x series. Jalan Membina blk 19/20 etc those are near Tiong Bahru MRT. Sembawang blk 34x also near MRT but need to cross road. That alone can take 1 min. Even Woodlands I consider non of the flats near Woodlands MRT because of the big open open space around the MRT which residents need to walk quite a distance to reach MRT. Yours is only The Peak and you can claim got dragon got tiger is near MRT. Please lah, yours is only walkable distances and definitely more than 5 mins.

Yishun MRT is much better than sembawang/woodlands side. Morning peak hours got train start from yishun, evening peak hours got train terminate at yishun. Those who stay sembawang/woodlands can only s* thumb. Peak hours can see 5 min interval for trains, then it will be jam packed. 
 

Being stay in sembawang for 10+ years, I'll avoid sembawang/woodlands area when I get a flat, die die won't stay here. No choice got to fork out more and get smaller units, I'm getting very pissed off with my place. Location problem and huge influx of FT.

Frankly speaking, Woodlands is better than Sembawang. Though Sembawang is more quiet and less complicated than Woodlands, in terms of transportation by car have to go woodlands or yishun to link to expressway. By bus not enough services to go major places in Singapore.

hmm, you seems very defensive when pple say the peak not near mrt.. come on pple defination of near mrt is diff from yours lo.. my ang mo friend will say the peak very near mrt then i told him if u throw a stone able to hit station then consider near.. haha..
 

seriously the peak able to reach tp mrt in 5 min mei.. my hse nearer to mrt then the peak to mrt yet i took more than 5min.. maybe i very weak.. 
 

btw you mention abt potong pasir being not very good.. too me potong pasir is just beside tp and yet cheaper than tp..and when PP falls to PAP (i hope not.. haha) then price might rise a lot.. haha

Concede what defeat? What is there to concede? This is not a game or competition. We are just giving our opinion. And I disagree with your point that the Peak is consider near MRT. But as an estate itself Toa Payoh is good. So you need Toa Payoh to win the rest of the less attractive estates? Ok you win lor  
 

Anyway to say so and so estate is more premium is just a joke lah. We all know where is more premium and it is definitely not what you mentioned above. How can HDB estates be class as premium?

Aiyah the price is a reflection of the failed government policy... bring in 2 much foreign talent, didnt consider whether Singapore can affford it or not.... as a result inflation.
 

But of course another main reason is the low interest rate environment is fueling bubble in the property market, commodity market, share market....while our pay remain stagnant, lower bonuses...
 

Fyi nothing go up forever, as the saying goes in stock market lingo... you dont want to be the last one holding the baby.... history always repeat itself, u read donald tsang in apec warning about the property bubble....
 

If i am a young couple getting married, will bunk in with parents and buy directly from HDB, wait 3 year lor... no choice... with $600 k, u finish paying HDB, u end up paying 1  million dollar with interest... good luck....

Whatever it is the point is clear.
 

PRs can and will pay. Singaporeans priced out of their preferred homes? That is non of the govt's concern................ they will just tell you to buy something cheaper lor. Or else work harder lor......
 

Many feeling very shitty in the past few years, it will boil over at the rate we are going.............



 

Yeah exactly. i am earning 800 per mth how to afford to pay for my 2 handphone bill? my utilities? weather so hot dun on air con can meh? and the nearest MRT to my place is a lousy 200 meter away, flat price so expensive how to buy near MRT? Worst still i am still watching 32" LCD nia, ball so small where got shiok? and when can i afford a car??? 
 

it will definitely boil over.... it nearly happen at cheng san the other time...

well, stupid or not.. that's subjective... but look at tampines, its 5 room flat is still very affordable at 400+k.. it hasn't picked up to the point at the golden triangle place.. where its 500-600+k... 
 

doesn't matter.. we live in singapore.. everyone is like that.. ERP doesn't even affect me.. it affects singaporeans who intend to cheat the system by using Toa Payoh as a bypass.. if you do not know, please dun anyhow comment...
 

to me, tampines is just like another woodlands, jurong west... to me, location is everything.. okie? happy? i am happy! heehee...
 

if those suburban locations ever rise to the price of prime locations... then dun worrie.. those prime locations will rise even higher...
 

just look @ Queenstown... @ Pinnacle Duxton @ The Peak @ Natural Loft @ Park Central @ City View... 
 

They are almost sold out.. :) but then buyers are still willing to buy...
 

I am not prepared to fork out 400+k for places like Seng Kang / Punggol... i would rather top up another 100k to get better locations in the golden triangle...



 

u r just like a frog lei... only move ard in TPY. And consider Sg is already so small..   and i presume u pay cash for ur PIG.. orr..soli .. PEAK.  if not when people finish paying their flats in the waste land area and you are still paying urs... and yeah ur PEAK is 999 tenture. maybe ur kids can continue to pay ... provided they can get into THOSE so many good schools in your area..  
 

to each his own i guess... wat does a hillbilly like me know... happy? i am happy!!

true, but then you must think of the other 60% who doesn't have private transport.. i was looking at the MRT system.. shiok manz! when the circle line, thomson line and downtown lines are completed... one would really appreciate the convenience of staying in toa payoh...
 

and dun talk about buses... geez... they are unpredictable and always jam packed with people.. though its the same for MRT...
 

The Peak @ Toa Payoh ^^
 

now i can appreciate why everyone WANTS to stay in toa payoh despite being very packed.. Best of all, government already has committed to renewing the town as written in the press.. no like some towns like hougang, potong pasir.. sorrie no punt intended again..



 

When it is so much difference in travel time between car and MRT in the case here, MRT is not an option at all to time-conscious travellers. If however you are the budget-conscious type and doesnt possess own vehicle, why not the bus? Bus service 111 takes the same route as car using Tanglin Road to Orchard. Inclusive of waiting time, it is still way much faster than MRT because of the totally different route.
 

No need to sell your Toa Payoh. No matter which transport you take you can't achive 5min to Orchard because of the far distance. And no need to sell your Google map. What so great about it? Thanks, my car already got Garmin GPS installed which is very common nowaday.

Oh the blue window, being there before. Very condo looking precinct. And also very quiet, whole precinct is like living in its own kampong separated from the rest of Sembawang, if you know what I mean. 
 

No lah I am just above average. A few years back me and my wife recce to alot of places in Singapore when we wanted to buy a flat. Just happen that Sembawang was one of the places we did look into and thats why know abit. The only places we never bother to look at are Tampines/Bedok/Marine Parade and generally the east side. For some reason east side has never been part of our consideration that time. But now things have started to change abit and soon we will start to look at a few areas on the east, for future reference

I know. Thats why how can it be 100 metres to MRT and have Sheng Siong downstairs at the same time? Contradicting right? From his flat walk to Khatib MRT still have to cross the road or overhead bridge. Cannot be 100 metres only. 
 

Yes its true resale prices for Yishun have increased alot. Reason being government has no choice but increase the value for Yishun flats because of the new hospital which will bring in crowds and business for Yishun residents. Thats why they have to expand the town centre/shopping mall to cater for increased crowd. Singaporeans and FTs working in hospital will also looking to rent or buy houses in Yishun too. With potential business and development going on prices of Yishun has to go up no matter what.

Matured estate, high floor units are always expensive. There are many other areas, like SK and Punggol where prices are more down to earth, and about as convenient.
 

Problem with S'poreans is that they are very choosy. At then end of the day, no matter how great is your home, you turn off the lights and go to sleep. Everything looks the same when you shut your eyes and lseep. What matters is that the family is happy and healthy.

In case anyone is interested, 2 BTOs @ Punggol release today, Punggol Ripples and Punggol Sails  
 

One offer studio/3/4 rooms, the other 3/4/5 rooms. Prices for 4 rooms is $249k to $305k. So if you cant afford 4 room @ Queenstown, go for this one. Please ignore the location

I agree with you. In 2004, nobody buying, we were looking at condo/flat, decided on a 4rm flat, only 4 mins walk to MRT, got it at valulation. 

I seldom use the train but my hubby take the train to work daily. Again in 2008, the prices were down, nobody buying so we bought a apartment. 

Now the market is too hot let it cool down before shopping.

I really can't understand why some ppl are willing to pay more then half a million for a 99yr lease hold HDB and yet so many of us is complaining about how expensive the HDB is. But since they are some idiot willing to pay this that of amount who can blame the HDB on raising the flat price higher. 
 

Really spoit the market.......

Y ppl are still willing to pay so much for a flat? fr wat i understand, first there is the supply vs demand logic.. when demand outstrip supply , prices can only go up for a fixed no of goods. just like rice, when good harvest, it's cheap; when bad harvest, it's become expensive.
 

1st, the population of SG has now b allooned to 5mil.. this create demand. but supply of housing is still not ramp up by Gov. so this create a pent-up demand for housing. that is why the application for ready flats are over-subscribed by nearly 20 times. 

2nd, BTOs need to wait at least 3 to 4 yrs from ordering to completion. btw, not many BTOS being offered also until recently.

3rd, private housing is still expensive compared to HDB housing, so most young couples and PRs will head towards HDB resale market.
 

from the above , who can actually do something to prevent it but seems to ignore the situation? i shall leave it to the rest to ponder over....

To add, it is not easy to increase supply to match the demand in a short time, especially in the case of housing. It takes at least a couple of years for houses to build. But in the long run the supply will be able to match the demand(maybe even oversupply!) and therefore price will stablise(or decrease). So if really you are not in a rush to buy a house, wait for the time being. But if you choose to believe that housing will be more expensive in the future then go for it.

When i bot my TPY 5-room for 562k, many tell me SIAO why not buy condo instead ? 
 

I tell them ya right.......the surrounding condo near/around TPY costs well over 1 mill for the equivalent 122sqm size !!!!!
 

Thats hell a lot more to pay for a little bit more security and basic ammentities that i do not use everyday. 
 

And i do not wana consider out-laying condos cos i refuse to pay a single cent of ERP and waste 1-2hours in the crazy traffic jams.

The value of my flat increases faster in the Up trend and slower in the down.
 

Actually near MRT, Supermarket/Shopping Malls also means you save money.

I stay beside MRT and Mall and I treat the Supermarket as my Fridge.

Buying only when there is Special offer.  Don't underestimate this - we can save 20~30% grocery bills/mth.
 

MRT - frankly I don't use so much but my family does alot = more savings.

Shopping - we can get almost all our needs there and if need to go other Malls, MRT serves us.
 

All these Tally...

i really dread it when the peak n trevista are completed... i can tell u the traffic out of tpy in the morning and into tpy in the evening is already quite bad now
 

welcome to tpy




yes,i still rem the time when i drove my wife to work in TPY every morn.. many cars all go exit CTE towards Lorong Chuan to go TPY so as to avoid the ERP charges. Then LTA put one gantry at the entry to TPY. But that is still cheaper than using the CTE to go towards City. so still many cars using that route from TPY to reach city area. going home to TPY is equally jammed as many cars go via TPY to reach AMK ,bishan and go up north to avoid the evening ERPs on CTE. but think KPE should help a bit to divert traffic away from CTE for those living in NE and E.

ponder it for a long time I guess it should be Gahmen aka HDB since all land in Sg are state land if Gahmen dont release the land no one can build more houses and since HDB is the Gahmen contactor so everything is still being control by them all of the same, we in the end still lose out.

i m not sure abt the prices, but i believe gov will sure be trying hard now to ramp up the supply of flats within the next 2 yrs. Y ? cos GE is just around the corner soon. If they still can't try to fulfil the basic needs of the young SG citizens, then they might have to pay the political price for it!!! many Sgporeans are quite stuck between a rock and a hard place. some had failed to get a flat from HDB and resale market, and might just go the other way to vent their frustrations. but let's just keep our fingers cross and see.. In just 3 months , HDB has pushed out 4 to 6 BTO projects..hmmm?  no wonder Mah says no hurry cos there are ample supply! i think next 2-3 mths will have some more BTOs coming out!

Yes government is increasing the supply but as I said, the supply will not soften the prices in the short run because it takes time to build houses. But government is the reason why we have market disequilibrium. It is their policy that resulted this. The market is so imbalance now thats why we see ridiculous prices.

Today I saw someone posted in some other website asking why always BTO at Punggol, no other place. To this poster and Ivan, you guys must understand that there isnt alot of empty land around Singapore left, and those places mentioned above still have alot. City and near city definitely not much and may not even be allocated for HDB flats at all, unless some current buildings are tear down to make way for more flats to be build, which is very unlikely. 
 

For your info Jurong West is not ulu at all. It is one of the most happening places with alot of activities going on. It is far in distance but definitely not ulu. Maybe you dont frequent that side thats why you think is ulu.

Well IMO BTO is still an option amid took a longer time. and these flats though not cheap but it is still affoldable. so if like me price is most important consideration, then have to forgo location and other convinent. if want it fast,want it now, want it good location, want it convient, then market force will decide lor.. tink this rule apply to almost everything.
 

So if it really expensive, why die die must buy? or die die must buy now?

If u don't work in town, no reason really to buy a house near or in town. but having say that, those that r filty rich will always have the best of both world. I remember visiting a friend that stay in the old armour park. when i took a walk out to orchard road, the surrounding in the vicinity were like in canada or states.only when i step out in orchard then was like stepping into a different world. 
 

so u can have the best of both world if u have the kind of moola...

A FOUR-ROOM Queenstown HDB flat has sold for $653,000, setting a new record for price per sq ft (psf), amid continuing red-hot demand for resale flats.
 

The buyers, a male Indonesian permanent resident and a Singaporean woman, could have bought a condominium unit in an outlying area for the price.
 

But they were won over by the location, just five minutes walk from Queenstown MRT station, and on the top, 40th floor of the block, with unblocked views of greenery from all windows.
 

The four-year-old 969sqft unit at Forfar Heights, Strathmore Avenue, sold for $68,000 above valuation - a level determined by an independent valuer.
 

This works out to $674 psf, smashing the previous record of $609 psf, achieved in January last year, by about 10per cent.
 

This may be an unusually high price but resale prices have been moving up.



 

the buyer must be damn rich and got money no where to spend, thus using this channel to showcase their wealth... lucky seller, must be smiling all the way to the bank....

do note that Valuation is a dirty word.
 

10 yrs ago when i bought my first property, i ask the credit officer for the valuation of the apartment.  He said he could get it valued as high as there is a buyer willing to buy.  the difference was a deviation of more than 10%
 

in other words if the property was dealt at $1mil, it could be valued between $900 to $1.1 easily depending on which advantage is required.
 

so to hell with valuation.  The real valuation is what you are willing to pay and not what people tell you to pay.

Who gives the valuation so high? The valuer? Or his company? I can tell you its neither. Just look at Punggol and you will know. Facilities and amenities not even reach a certain level and the flats there can valued so high, on what basis? Flat age younger? Maybe. Better build? Maybe. But the more obvious reason is the government is holding up the prices and maintaining it for Punggol for whatever reasons.

but property agents are really overpaid lot

why they get a commission for each property transaction but you read so often there are hiccups that the buyers or sellers need to handle themselves



 

The trade is so lucutive that now some of my PRC colleagues are also into it part time.

Seems like this is another secondary career for many.

One of the best logic I see. The gahmen recently adviced the public not to engage in the property frenzy, pull the brakes etc. Bt wat is really happening?......The surge in the property prices was not expected in the 3rd quarter. Not by any property agencies & certainly not by the gahmen. It's driven mostly by human sentiments to the news released. More fundamental. The gahmen, as we knw operates like a corporate, did not harvest frm the property surge. Nw, tho a property bubble has indeed ballon, prices hav yet to reach the peak. The gahmen thus release state land for residential developement nx year for bidding, a move to slow dwn the surge. And oso discouraging the public frm engaging in the bubble. Bt if we were to look deeper, the move will slow dwn the surge, not to stop the surge, in the price causing the resale market sellers lowering the price, making the buyers more willing to purchase it. For those high asking price properties, the sellers will not be motivated to sell if they are not in a rush to purchase another, thus pulling out frm the sale. The chain reaction might tilt to high demand low supply.....again. Tis of cos will affect the new developements too, its all chained. Which by then, the sale of the state land is ready & open for bidding. If the demand in the resale is still high and the supply is weak, existing new developements facing the same situation, the developers might jolly well bid their highest for these lands seeing the potential returns. And when that happens......Our gahmen is not stupid, every move it makes is usually link to monetary benefits. When the prices of land increase, properties increase. The prices of HDBs are drawin close to some of the older condos. Some hav ponder, I can buy a 0.5 mil HDB why not buy a 600k condo. Gap not significant enuff. The prices of pte properties need to hav a significant gap against HDB. Do u tink gahmen will lower the HDB prices? Or will it drive the pte property price up in order to make HDBs look more affordable? When private developements are high, time to build more HDBs.....more expensive HDBs. Why not build them NOW & stabilise the demand for HDBs which in return will stable the price? Dont the gahmen knw dat HDBs are under supply? If the prices of HDBs remain high & the gap is insignificant compare to a EC/condo, its logical to buy a EC/cond. So wldnt dat make a increase in demand for it of which it will chain react to the other range of pte properties? Why the sale of land for pte developements? Cos the time is not rite yet for building more HDBs? The island is not facing a shortage of luxurious low/mid/high-end pte properties due to the influx of FTs......We are simply facing a shortage of PLACES TO RESIDE IN.

Are HDBs affordable? Yes....compared to the price of the pte properties. Its peanuts again to afford a HDB.

So the gahmen speaks the truth......

Property companies says that BTO is priced 10-20% lower than the resale in that same area.
 

So if resale value of Punggol high, then their new BTOs in Punggol can also priced high high mah.
 

Isn't great to be HDB, to be able to control the prices of public property to their own advantage? No private companies can do this. It will take a very major screw up for HDB to not be very profitable.

but HDB says they incurred almost '2 billion of losses' ??  but they never report which gov bodies earned "2 billion of profit" !!! 



 

HDB is not suppose to be a profitable organisation. Their job is to provide affordable housing for the public. 
 

If you guys notice, government and their departments like to use the media to issue statements to either influence, give hint on a new policy or start a public debate to gauge the sentiments of Singaporeans.

that because the media is a spokeman for the govt policy. they are not allowed to have views that cross the OB markers.

easy lah, i shake leg also can sell 2 apartments in 2007.
 

why bother with agents. sell it yourself



 

Bro, nt everyone as savy as u lei. If everyone so savy, thn I cant "tan jiak" oreali. Leave sme business for poor ppl like me lah. Sme sellers in D15-16 are stuck wif their properties for mths becos of location near main roads, Cat2 road widening pending proposals, near construction developements etc. These properties are not easy to sell. These properties were in FSBO for a long time before the sellers decide to engage agents to sell. Some do not have the luxury of time to sell their properties. Some cldnt even get an offer. And not all sellers are willing to spend time marketing their properties. To them paying 10k-50k commission for them to spend more time doin other stuff worthwhile in life is like peanuts when they can afford to stay in a pte/landed property. I dont tink any of the sellers that I encounter frm FSBO were sellin on their own to save money, it was more for the curiousity & the feel of sellin it on their own.....Cos most of the time when the seller decides to let agents do the sellin, the comm sometimes can reach 2% rather thn 1%. Dun tink its abt saving the money/comm for agents. Dun tink they really bother. Bt thats oni my humble experience wif the more wealthy living in D15-16, there are another cat. of "rich ppl" tho......those I have already given up. And again, there are some who really likes to get hands on. "To each his own."
 

BTW, pls support the Lego project to help those who are in need caused by the recession.

no directed at you bro, but most agents very low standard.
 

When buying, they tell you price going up, when selling they tell you price going down.

I feel insulted when talking to them especially when some of them try to "educate" me about the market.
 

There's truth in your words, i do agree.

For me, i had the luxury of time. I am educated and prefer to learn how things work.

I also have regular lawyer to draft docs and do conveyancing for me.  

So I just did a bit of internet marketing, a bit of sales pitch to buyers and saved myself $30- 40k. it's not peanuts to me, i can buy a new Ducati. definitely worthwhile.  

at the same time i learn something.
 

Lego project , i gave already .
 

if you have semi d for sale 3000 - 4000 sf let me know.

but no main road type, ok?

thanks

No worries Bro, been talking to u a few times, I knw u nt directing at me. There are always blacksheeps, even myself kena frm fellow agents. Like i said, I guess u are the more "hands on" type & enjoy the process/learn something too. For semi-d, yes, bt oni in D15-16. I hav noticed those who flip their properties & went into renting, are comin out to the market to search nw. My team's guess is that the coming correction will not affect D15-16 dat much as in the prime areas. Currently, we are into the off-peak mths in properties. During these period, "reality" will sink in to the sellers mind.

More realistic pricing will be acheived. Already gt a few FSBO sellers withdraw their sale last week. Looks like the pricing is gona stabilise with a slight dwn trend correction in the comin transactions. U indeed did ur hmework, i guess. LOL. My guess is, buy after new year? For investment, rite?

And many hav failed. I failed too when I did it part-time. Its not a easy job.....Why property agents are paid high comm? Join, become 1 & then u judge whether it is high. For those who tink dat property agents are gettin high pay, let me intro u to the world of TV sales man......the high roller a mth can get 20K.....Yes, 20k by asking,"Can I help u, Sir?" & telling u, "tis brand is good, new model" etc. On avg durin COMTEX, SINTEC etc for dat few days oni, the comm is like 8k. Bt its not a easy job too when u get in contact wif ppl who does it. All jobs hav its hardship & rewards......



 

I didn't say it's an easy job, just to say that there are so much buying and selling going on, isn't it a lucutive trade?

It all depends on your luck (the location of the property you get to sell). I'm not into sales, so no matter how good $ it gets, I'll not dap into it.

Look at the recent downturn, people are still buying and selling properties as if there's no recession.

The question is how is this 2 billion losses derieved?

And how is the land valued. Why is Bukit Timah the most expensive place and not say Pasir Ris?

We are valuating land with no substantial support, anyone can just name a price - willing buyer, happy seller.

Unlike currencies are supported by gold reserves.

D15 - 16 , i can consider.

drop me info if you wish via PM.
 

Dont be fooled simply by the off peak months explanation.

Prices have reach a saturated point so people question value.
 

Liquidity is the key to everything you see now.

Once liquidity goes, that will be the true test of property value.
 

The formula for price reduction = abundant supply, low rental yield, uncertain economy and increase in regulations

which is right now.  i'm not saying it will cave in but definitely need to turn on the caution sign.
 

cheers bro
