National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan has assured Singaporeans that HDB flats are not shrinking, contrary to popular belief.
 

In fact, sizes of HDB flats have been the same for the past 15 years.
 

He was speaking at the annual REACH Contributors' Forum on Wednesday night, when a student from the National University of Singapore raised concerns about shrinking flat sizes.
 

Mr Khaw said Singapore will not go the way of Hong Kong, where flats are far smaller.
 

'I would consider that a deterioration of our quality of life and we should avoid that,' he told the audience.
 

But he said that homes built by private developers are getting smaller, citing the increase of 'shoebox' units on the market.
 

The Government is keeping an eye on this trend, and if the proportion of such units becomes too high in the market, 'we may have to step in,' he said.
 

Mr Khaw also acknowledged that Singaporeans were concerned about expensive property prices but assured them that this was a 'temporary imbalance' of demand and supply.
 

'In the past five years, the population was growing rapidly that infrastructure could not keep up so because of the temporary imbalance, prices shot up. HDB has been aggressively pumping units into the market and although Singapore is not in the steady stage yet... there is some stabilisation,' he said.
 

'We are seeking their understanding and patience... we are getting there. We will continue to work hard at it. In the next five-year term, I'm committed to build at least 100,000 HDB flats if necessary,' he said.
 

He was fielding questions, along with Acting Minister Chan Chun Sing, at the REACH dialogue held at Scape that attracted about 200 participants that raised issues ranging from social equality, ethnic enclaves and building communities

HDB flat sizes not shrinking: Khaw Boon Wan 
 

SINGAPORE - National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan said on Wednesday night that HDB flats have been the same size for the past 15 years, and are not shrinking, contrary to popular belief.
 

Mr Khaw was responding to a National University of Singapore (NUS) student's question on HDB flat sizes at the annual REACH Contributors' Forum.
 

He added that they will not be reduced to the size of Hong Kong flats, which are far smaller, reported The Straits Times.
 
 

He told the audience that he would "consider that a deterioration of our quality of life and we should avoid that".
 

But homes by private developers are another matter, he noted, citing the increase in "shoebox" units on the market.
 

He said the Government may have to step in if the proportion of such units becomes too high.
 

Mr Khaw also assured Singaporeans the the high property prices now is a "temporary imbalance" of demand and supply.
 

"In the past five years, the population was growing rapidly that infrastructure could not keep up so because of the temporary imbalance, prices shot up. HDB has been aggressively pumping units into the market and although Singapore is not in the steady stage yet... there is some stabilisation," he said.
 

"We are seeking their understanding and patience... we are getting there. We will continue to work hard at it. In the next five-year term, I'm committed to build at least 100,000 HDB flats if necessary," he said.

Strictly speaking, he is not wrong. Flat overall size is the same in the last 15yrs (don't compare those built in the 70's, 80's, early 90's, etc). How to fault him..... :angry:  :wacko:     But I really questioned the rationale behind larger aircon ledge, etc...

Your point is that a smaller sized family only need a smaller flat size,
 

same point made by the HDB CEO.
 


 

"Flats are shrunk only 5 to 10% in the last 20-30 years"

Khaw is very selective with his comparison year... 
 

If you go back another 5 years from 1997 to 1992,
 

then HDB flats have shrunk... according to HDB CEO in the video.

Khaw is at least correct on the "popular belief" portion.  
 

See poll results
 

Yes. Same for the past 15 years [ 2 ]   

No. Shrunk for the past 15 years [ 10 ]  
 
 
 

I salute Khaw for knowing so well the ground 
 

has such a belief of shrinking flats even without the use of polling.

he might say it's good for you can squeeze and enjoy family tight kinship in a 5 room pigeon hole with 7 pax,unlike him who lived in a few millions bungalow and feel empty even with 7 pax.

next he will say it's good for you that you can get squeeze like sardine on mrt and buses and get to enjoy the sinkie spirit of squeezing when on way to work,while he feels lonely sitting at the backseat of his e class or 5 series.

Khaw's calibrated choice of base year is disingenious.
 

Material aspirations, which includes size of flats, are determined by experiences rooted in family background. 
 

This is pretty well established.
 
 

Some one buying a flat today say in their 30s are born when flats were built in the 1975-1985 (perhaps a minority moved).
 

The HDB buyers of today are more likely to compare with their experiences of house sizes built in the above period,
 

as opposed to 1997/1998.

bigger units possibly but prices also bigger if anything goes with this current lowest bidder win system, coupled to market valuation of state land.
 

Is this what we really want then? okay then the flat GFA will be increased. how about the overall purchase price of the flat? Are we really unsettled by the sizing itself? I think we are bothered by the fact that we are paying for increasingly expensive flats which are getting smaller progressively. I am worried by the way Khaw is playing this game. He seems to be shaping the whole issue to centre around the complaint that the flats are too small rather than the flats are too small and too expensive to be considered realistically affordable. That way, he will be able to get away with simply increasing the purchase price of the flats to compensate for the increased GFA we so called wanted.

10 yrs ago when i first apply for a flat 5rm already 110sqm, 4 rm already 90sqm. So actually KBW is right, HDB didn't shrink the size of HDB flat. Still the same size till today. Maybe the layout has changed over time and it look and feel smaller with balcony and such.



 

Last time 5 rooms flats have big balcony. Now don't think flats have balcony leow.

 80s 4 room 103 sqm

 90s 4 room 115 sqm (early 90s;post 98 start building 90 sqm 4 room)

 00s 4 room 90 sqm



 

Not forgetting that last time 
 

3 room got 3I, 3S,

4 room got 4S, 4A
 

If I not wrong, the 4A (~ 109sqm) is about the just few sqm smaller than the new 5 room (110 sqm).

Actually most flats nowadays have no balcony. 
 

Theoretically my upcoming 110sqm piegon hole (113 with AC ledge) should be quite close to my paternal home of 124 sqm excluding the balcony, but somehow i still think it will feel small haha

bigger units possibly but prices also bigger if anything goes with this current lowest bidder win system, coupled to market valuation of state land.
 

Is this what we really want then? okay then the flat GFA will be increased. how about the overall purchase price of the flat? Are we really unsettled by the sizing itself? I think we are bothered by the fact that we are paying for increasingly expensive flats which are getting smaller progressively. I am worried by the way Khaw is playing this game. He seems to be shaping the whole issue to centre around the complaint that the flats are too small rather than the flats are too small and too expensive to be considered realistically affordable. That way, he will be able to get away with simply increasing the purchase price of the flats to compensate for the increased GFA we so called wanted.



 

Yes that's what he's doing

LOL... thats why I sometimes dun get why some young couples insist on getting new HDBs. So small. For the same price in the same area, you can get a resale ppty that is bigger and if you search properly, the $ you pay may get you solid Marble Flooring and Invertor Air-con. Best is, you know who your neighbours will be when u decide to buy.

Khaw is correct. HDB flats size never shrink. Its the general population getting fatter and lazier and hence think that the flats are getting smaller. The only things getting smaller are the Singaporean males balls which has inadvertently SHRUNK over the years.

On paper the size qt big, but during viewing, you see that it's actually qt small..

staircase took up qt a portion, which was what you have mentioned, +aircon and all the random small stuff..

living room is qt small only..

and the walk to mrt is about 7min.. good thg is that watertown is near, so price wont drop much, can be paper millionaire

that's why those single floor ec penthouse are very popular. imagine you dont need to climb up climb down and you get an extra room because there is no staircase  
 

this one canberra, the floor plan is not bad, but:

I agree to your 1st sentence but not your 2nd.
 

HDB has size with aircon ledge and without on its floor plan. (standard is 3sq m) There is no plantar box or anything similar. 

It's all in condos now  
 

U dun want to have AC ledge can .... then have a hole in your wall lor

TBF only the one in Bold are useless.
 

Service Yard was just a section out portion from the last time kitchen where we put our bamboo stick and washing machine. last time is we section ourself, now they do it for us. 
 

Balcony, DBSS lah. new flat apart from some 5room the rest dont have, somemore last time all five room also have balcony, plus some ppl like.
 

Bomb shelter also depend, some ppl need store room. some ppl dont need. for me, i dont need. so its a white elephant to me.

Shrinking HDB flats due to need to maximise land and to adapt

But some say smaller apartments do not square with needs of a developed nation
 

 By Jessica Cheam 
 

The average HDB flat has shrunk over the years, but this is due to the need to maximise Singapore's limited land and to adapt to changing household sizes, the Housing Board said on Friday.
 

Responding to queries from The Straits Times, it said that these needs meant sizes of each flat type had to be made slightly smaller over time, and the agency's architects have compensated by increasing the use of internal space through better flat layouts.
 

It added that HDB regularly reviews flat sizes, taking into account factors such as changes in demographic trends and lifestyle habits.
 

HDB's comments come after a debate erupted over earlier remarks made by its chief executive Cheong Koon Hean that smaller flats do not have to mean a lower quality of living.

National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan has assured Singaporeans that HDB flats are not shrinking, contrary to popular belief.
 

In fact, sizes of HDB flats have been the same for the past 15 years.
 

He was speaking at the annual REACH Contributors' Forum on Wednesday night, when a student from the National University of Singapore raised concerns about shrinking flat sizes.
 

Mr Khaw said Singapore will not go the way of Hong Kong, where flats are far smaller.
 

'I would consider that a deterioration of our quality of life and we should avoid that,' he told the audience.
 

But he said that homes built by private developers are getting smaller, citing the increase of 'shoebox' units on the market.
 

The Government is keeping an eye on this trend, and if the proportion of such units becomes too high in the market, 'we may have to step in,' he said.
 

Mr Khaw also acknowledged that Singaporeans were concerned about expensive property prices but assured them that this was a 'temporary imbalance' of demand and supply.
 

'In the past five years, the population was growing rapidly that infrastructure could not keep up so because of the temporary imbalance, prices shot up. HDB has been aggressively pumping units into the market and although Singapore is not in the steady stage yet... there is some stabilisation,' he said.
 

'We are seeking their understanding and patience... we are getting there. We will continue to work hard at it. In the next five-year term, I'm committed to build at least 100,000 HDB flats if necessary,' he said.
 

He was fielding questions, along with Acting Minister Chan Chun Sing, at the REACH dialogue held at Scape that attracted about 200 participants that raised issues ranging from social equality, ethnic enclaves and building communities

HDB flat sizes not shrinking: Khaw Boon Wan 
 

SINGAPORE - National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan said on Wednesday night that HDB flats have been the same size for the past 15 years, and are not shrinking, contrary to popular belief.
 

Mr Khaw was responding to a National University of Singapore (NUS) student's question on HDB flat sizes at the annual REACH Contributors' Forum.
 

He added that they will not be reduced to the size of Hong Kong flats, which are far smaller, reported The Straits Times.
 
 

He told the audience that he would "consider that a deterioration of our quality of life and we should avoid that".
 

But homes by private developers are another matter, he noted, citing the increase in "shoebox" units on the market.
 

He said the Government may have to step in if the proportion of such units becomes too high.
 

Mr Khaw also assured Singaporeans the the high property prices now is a "temporary imbalance" of demand and supply.
 

"In the past five years, the population was growing rapidly that infrastructure could not keep up so because of the temporary imbalance, prices shot up. HDB has been aggressively pumping units into the market and although Singapore is not in the steady stage yet... there is some stabilisation," he said.
 

"We are seeking their understanding and patience... we are getting there. We will continue to work hard at it. In the next five-year term, I'm committed to build at least 100,000 HDB flats if necessary," he said.

Please particpate in the poll.
 


 

So 16 years ago, people can still buy new and bigger flats of the same category.

And 15 years ago, they started to shrink the flat size (5 room flat in the past used to be 120+sqm, now only 110sqm), but instead of reducing the price, they increased it.

I can also play around with the phrasing and words. Why didn't he say 20 years ago?
 

I'm very amazed he feels that because family size had shrunk, people want smaller flats. They could have left the initial flat size untouched. If people finds a 5 room unit too big, they can always get a 4-room unit. The current kitchens are unbelievale small, I don't see why they should shrink the kitchen size just because "youngsters seldom cook". Is the minister so short sighted that parents cannot come over to stay with their kids and cook? Who had complained that their units/kitchens are too big? And on the other hand, I don't see HDB addressing to the other more valid complaints that many of us are complaining such as poor workmanship/spilling concrete...

I think I understand why many people keep thinking HDB flat has shrink in size including me. I was puzzled when KBW said HDB flat has not shrink in last 15 years but why I keep thinking it has shrink in size. 
 

The real reason is because of price keep increasing but size remains the same and that give illusion of me maybe others keep thinking HDB has shrink in size but is not as it is actually the price increase that make people think it has shrink in size.   [laugh]
