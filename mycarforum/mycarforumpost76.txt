sgd plunge is worst. we lose our monetary value overnight. affects our currency value as well as trading power/buying and selling power.
 

bubble burst affects local economy only. singapore not big enough to cause worldwide meltdown like usa did in 2008

The Institute of International Finance, Inc. | Economic Research 

The environment for capital flows to emerging economies has worsened recently. Global risk aversion has surged amid concerns about the duration of ultra-easy U.S. monetary policy, sending ripples through EMs. EM currencies have plummeted in recent months, driven in part by a reversal of portfolio equity flows and reduced bond inflows since March. Overall, we project that private capital inflows to EMs will amount to $1,145bn this year, a decline of $36bn relative to 2012. Capital outflows by EM residents continue to grow, with

Really, the govt has so many times discourage ppl not to buy but in the end Singaporeans still bought and pushed prices up higher. How many times have we heard from ppl that property will not go down and better to buy now than later? Khaw has so many times preached patience and told ppl to wait for the property market to correct a little bit before going in. See what now? People who bought during the peak and are fumbling now deserve it. If for own stay, then can only LPPL. All I can say is that the govt has a central focus and loss measure is not part of it now, too bad for these people.

What we all don't understand and don't see is the other aspects of the property market ...
 

Remember the cooling measures and remember the people buying like there is no tomorrow. These people will either need to refinance their mortgage next year or the year after. These people were over leveraged on low introductory interest and their introductory interest is due to expire. These people may have more than one property and one of the cooling measures is that they can only borrow 60% of the mortgage. If one cannot top up, one is forced to accept the higher rates of interest. Monthly mortgage payments will go up quite a bit and with interest rates rising ...................................

Those small time show offs berating others for taking loans, just ignore them, your life is yours to live. Live the way you think is best for you.
 

But from the governments perspective, they cannot ignore it if too many people are over leveraging themselves, because it will affect the financial stability of the banks, which is intertwined with the whole economy. (if you were in the market during the 2008 Lehman crisis , you will know what I mean)

Jobs, businesses, property, retirement funds, insurance policies are all at risk.

again i say dat property is commodity n is subject to external forces on top of basic supply demand.

Allow me to give my point
 

There is no crash. Just that pappy created policies that clamp down on speculation
 

But lucky only slow down because of their policies but no crash  
 

You see the prices whether it would rise or fall, once they cancel all cm
 

But just ignore me.. just coffee shop talk, talk only
 

even crash also no money for 40% deposit

Bank lending breaches psychological barrier
 

Loans-to-deposits ratio crosses 100% mark despite slower lending; analysts preach prudence as leverage concerns grow
 

Singapore
 

THE banking sector's loans-to-deposits ratio crossed 100 for the first time since the Asian financial crisis, providing evidence that the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS's) recent moves to curb excessive lending were timely, say economists.
 

Bank lending in July continued to slow from a year ago for a third consecutive month, dragged down by slower growth in consumer loans. According to preliminary figures released by the MAS yesterday, domestic banking unit (DBU) loans rose 17.6 per cent to $539 billion in July year-on-year, down slightly from June's 17.7 per cent growth.
 

But what caught the industry's eye was the fact that the sector's loans-to-deposits ratio breached the 100 per cent threshold - marking the first time since September 1995 that this has occurred.
 

A ratio beyond 100 per cent means that banks are now lending more than they are taking in.
 

"I think it's a sign for everyone to be more prudent, because we haven't really seen such a quick rise in loans-to-deposits ratio for many years," said UOB economist Francis Tan, who noted that, on average, the city-state's loans-to-deposits ratio typically hovers around 88.3 per cent.
 

"The fact that it's getting higher means there is more leverage in the system, so in the event of a crisis - which is predominantly driven by external issues - people may be overstretched in repaying the instalments they owe," said Mr Tan, adding that the 100 per cent threshold acts as a "psychological benchmark".
 

Over the month, total bank loans rose 1.2 per cent at the end of July, faster than June's 0.7 per cent growth.
 

Business loans grew 1.6 per cent over the month to $321.1 billion, rising from the 0.7 per cent growth in June.
 

But even though loans to businesses accelerated slightly year-on-year - rising 20.8 per cent in July from 20.4 per cent in June - the increase was not enough to offset a slower growth in consumer loans.
 

Compared to a year ago, growth in loans to consumers slowed to 13.2 per cent and reached $217.9 billion, moderating from June's 13.8 per cent. On a month-on-month basis, consumer loans grew at 0.7 per cent in July, as they did in June.
 

Economists attribute the slowdown in year-on-year consumer lending to recent policy measures to cool the exuberant car and property markets, as well as new loan curbs that encourage financial prudence.
 

Housing and bridging loans - the largest consumer loans segment making up 74 per cent of the basket - continued to grow at a slower pace of 14.1 per cent in July, down from 14.5 per cent in June. In month-on-month terms, total housing loans were just 0.8 per cent higher.
 

Said DBS economist Irvin Seah: "We're no longer seeing total loans growth of 20-plus per cent, and it's largely because of the cooling measures introduced by the government - particularly the most recent TDSR (total debt servicing ratio) measure.
 

"I think that will continue to weigh down the consumer loan growth number, and for good reason," said Mr Seah.
 

"We have to be careful about consumer leverage, which is already at a historical high, and probably one of the highest in the region. It's an area of concern, and another reason for why the introduction of (the) TDSR (was) the right way to go," added Mr Seah.
 

Meanwhile, car loans shrank for an eighth straight month, falling 7.4 per cent from a year ago. Lending for cars was 2 per cent thinner in July compared to June.
 

Economists agreed that dampened demand for cars continues to feed into the decline in car loans, due to MAS vehicle loan curbs and high certificate of entitlement (COE) premiums.
 

Despite July's slightly stronger year-on-year showing in business lending, both Mr Tan and Mr Seah believe this will moderate in the months ahead.
 

"Quite a large chunk of Singapore's trade is intra-regional, so if Asia grows at a slower pace, that will slow business loans down," said Mr Seah.
 

When asked if overall bank lending numbers were still healthy - since coming off the 20-plus per cent growth rates seen in late 2011 and early 2012 - Mr Seah of DBS said: "I think from now on we'll need to look at loans growth in a totally different perspective. We shouldn't be focusing on the headline number anymore; we should distinguish between corporate and consumer loans.
 

"An improvement in corporate loans implies better investments, which is positive. But if we see an uptick in consumer loans, that means rising consumer leverage, and that will mean a negative thing."

Where got so many proclaim cash rich? Only cigar sommelier cum table wiper wat.
 

The rest of us just live by the humble adage: No money, don't buy.
 

Actually. If only a small number of businessmen default and go broke, govt is not worried. So sory your friend's family happened to be one of them.
 

But if the majority of working population and property asset owners go into negative equity because of asset price crash, or working population lost jobs and cannot make the monthly repayments, THEN the govt got huge problem on its hands. Cos it affects banks, stock market, listed companies, SMEs, their employees, the whole chain gang will kena and it goes back again in a circle. More employees lose jobs or pay cut, more cannot make payments, and so on it goes.
 

So the govt also trying very hard not to let it happen.
 

So property prices won't crash. It may go back to saner levels but crash? Never. The govt won't let it. As you know, our property market is a very tightly controlled and manipulated one.

Resale HDB prices are backed and benchmarked by BTO prices.
 

Private condo prices are backed and benchmarked by the most expensive resale HDB prices.
 

Do we agree on that?
 

If we do, then consider this.
 

BTO prices are set by govt.
 

If BTO prices maintain, I don't see how the rest could crash to a level below their backing?

After 4 years (and counting) of anti-speculator cooling measures, we should not be seeing many fire sales during a recession.
 

Most people who bought in the last 4 years can actually hold.

iirc, BTO prices are set by govt but is based on lower end of the surrounding resale HDB prices. Something like that. 

in a crash there will be no demand, surround resale HDB prices will drop. And as you mentioned, the condo benchmark will drop. So private will also fall.
 

Govt putting in recent measures to prevent bubble are good moves to control prices.

i won't apply bearish and bull approach too much to property cos it's a very stable asset. Long term, property gains. That's an irrefutable trend. One should not invest in property based on views, but on earning power and long term approach.

There will not be a crash because there will always be demand.
 

The 6.9m population will ensure that.
 

Also, BTO supply is manipulated.  The govt can always turn off the tap a la Mah Bow Tan style.
 

The resulting drop in supply vs demand in subsequent years will ensure a skyrocketing of HDB prices (and by proxy, private condo prices) like we have seen in the past 10 years.
 

This time it is different, yeah, cos we are gonna have 6.9m people on this tiny island. And the gates are always easy to open again if that's not enough.

Your approach may work better in more liquid assets.
 

For property, best to think longer term as it is highly illiquid.
 

Preparing and reacting according to circumstances rarely work to effect in the property market cos the lead times are just too long. Option is 2 weeks.  The completion takes 8 to 10 weeks after that.  How to do back to back trading?  Lots could happen within 3 months.

Investments based on fundamentals should not be about reaction to circumstance. A very simple example would be Apple's stock. It fell from $200 during Lehman to $80. Panicky investors ran and reacted. Those who invested with a fundamentals mindset and kept the stock saw it rose to a peak of $700. Today's $500 but that's another story. 
 

What are fundamentals? Property wise would be...is a country governed well? Does it have sound economic fundamentals? Is location good and so on...And as an individual, must be whether got money or not. I know buying landed property today is good but it's out of my league. If it's within my league, i will buy with absolute confidence. Condo im not so sure unless EC. Good times bad times, there are always good things to invest on.

Property price in a small city will never be cheap. I googled once on USA property price index during Lehman. Remarkably, NYC experienced the smallest dip compared to other parts of US. btw, HK most ex PSF is about 10k. We are around 6k. Squeeze another few million here and those who think price is high now ain't seen nothing yet!

And the best thing is: Singapore property prices actually kelong one.
 

High demand, low supply.  Every opportunist's wet dream. Most people who were in some way involved in property over the last 10 years surely made some substantial money from it, whether they were buyer, seller, agent, developer, builder, contractor, interior design, etc.

This is very funny, people been complaining and voicing concern of housing being expensive and if if keep rising, property bubble will form. During that time government said, don't worry housing is still affordable. I mean should government have foresight to see it on rising trend even with ikan bilis measure for many years that property price still on rise. It means government is not going an effective job. Until recently then come out with TSR which should have been implemented in year2009. If not in 2011 after GE where there is a major change in minister appointment. Tharman become clever and learn from the housing mistake, so he knows the measures he put in need to be fierce and not ikan bilis measure like what KBW did, and he come up with loan kerb which too bad 2nd hand car dealer ( leave with it ) . As that is the only way to prevent people to sink into deeper debt. I do not know, but I got feeling this time crisis gonna be must worst off than 1997, 2008 as the debt to savings ratio exceeded 100% and still on the rise with low interest rate. So when crisis come it will be far worst off that many can imagine. Many will say government will not let it happen. I tell you guys, this kind of thing is beyond government control one. Government did do something to reduce the bubble especially, but like I said, since 2009 till 2012 it's all ikan bilis measure where KBW should implement more fierce measures many years ago. So bubble will burst no matter what, but it is the matter of how big the bubble is.

Correct. Singapore has sound fundamentals.  As I have always told people who ask me if they should buy property: if you believe in Singapore, then you should buy.



 

Singapore got sound fundamentals meh ?  10years ago yes , everybody work hard for their takes . Now , I everybody dont need to work , just be landlord better profit ! Productivity drop to all time low , capital flow to the wrong type of trades and to the wrong people . Too much money park in properties is not good for general economy, it does not generate enough biz activities and job creation. You call these sound fundamentals ?

There will not be a crash because there will always be demand.
 

The 6.9m population will ensure that.
 

Also, BTO supply is manipulated.  The govt can always turn off the tap a la Mah Bow Tan style.
 

The resulting drop in supply vs demand in subsequent years will ensure a skyrocketing of HDB prices (and by proxy, private condo prices) like we have seen in the past 10 years.
 

This time it is different, yeah, cos we are gonna have 6.9m people on this tiny island. And the gates are always easy to open again if that's not enough.

FTrash will come , biz will not !  Even existing biz will also move away to cheaper place where values are found !  You have landlord asking for a little shop of 500sqft @ 15K to 20K per month , tell me what kind of biz can make good profit in that little shop ? The only biz I can think of is Sex shop , dont need captital one , 100% profit no stocks to purchase . You keep on adding pressure , soon or later FTrash also will leave because all their taking goes to rental , foods and tax , leaving them nothing to take home

No la, but fundamentals are still the same ma. Borrow when interest rate is low and hoping to sell at higher price, the cycle goes on and on until no one want to buy. Yes can earn rental income but, when economy not doing well, I doubt many will be able to get people to rent, plus rising interest rate. And dont underestimate domino effect.

Retail biz traditionally have always been one of thin profit margins. Many shops, like mine, just break even only. That said, don't be surprised if some of the more successful ones making good money. My bro's little shop of 150 sq ft every month turnover almost $60K....profit how much I dunno but must be big because he's expanding fast.

Correct. Singapore has sound fundamentals. As I have always told people who ask me if they should buy property: if you believe in Singapore, then you should buy.



 

This is a patently false assumption.
 

Singapore inherently is not on sound foundations. The fact that we have to import large numbers just to not shrink our GDP speaks volumes of why we are not stable.
 

The fact that a change in government will have confidence issues with investors means that we are not as sound as we would think.
 

The fact that Singapore's economy remains dependant on world economics means we HAVE NO FUNDAMENTALS. We are exposed to the whims and fancies of other bigger powers.
 

We don't have any natural resource. We don't have a domestic economy to speak of yet. We only have a pliant population. And one that will be continually pressed to eke out a living. Do not claim to have talent in the island. Our neighbours have more abundant talent which our MSM will not want to make known. Its is only sheer luck that their politics is not straightened out, unlike ours. Buts that is about to change too.
 

SARS was a good case in point. A measly virus almost wiped out our GDP for that year. Roads and schools and workplace and malls were all empty. Imagine more worse scenarios and you may understand what I mean.
 

We are on a knife-edge. Make no mistake.

For our locals. Everybody wants to get married and buy flat.  The demand is very high leh.
 

The issue is not whether price will drop due to economic forces. It will drop when govt dont want to lose any more votes. So BTO prices have to match the young couple's paycheck.

Well thanks for your advice.
 

Singapore is a lot like HK. No fundamentals of the conventional kind. We do not have natural resources, nor a big talent pool for conventional wealth creating industries in the western mold like engineering, IT and technology.
 

But what we have is our banking and finance industry. In fact the entire Singapore is one big bank.  We have everything you want to invest in.  Every single asset class.  You can even use us as a secure base from which you will be able to move around and invest in the region.  But whatever you do, please keep your money here.  We will keep your money safe and grow it.  Our taxes are next to nothing.

Was wondering why people keep saying government will not let property market crash la, or what so familiar sentences? I mean to be fair, government has no control 100% how property market will perform, it is purely base on demand and supply. Yes government can implement new rules and regulations that can affect buyers or speculators decision, but ultimately it will still depends on market forces.
 

The point here is that, there will be many that will be in denials, thinking government will not let crash happen are, crash will not happen are, or whatever sort of reasons saying crash will not happen. But it will happen in future no matter what base on fundamentals of what goes up must come down, plus low interest rate will not always stay low forever. Go think about it. Good luck to those who go in late, normally people very funny go in late ( time the market ) and when crash, blame on everyone except ownself, is it fair ? It's a fair game, if one want take the risk, and when market crash, please don't blame anyone they could think of, but blame onwself for making a brave decision or wrong decision.

I not saying government has 0% control over property supply. What I am saying government has no control how property market will perform base on world economy and fundamentals on money supply and sound principals on how economy function. It's like many things are beyond sg government control, like $ printing. Who can be darn sure USA will stop $ printing in future, or who can be darn sure that even if $ printing continue, the confidence of market is still there? And many more factors hAppen around the world which government has no control. When interest rate rise, can government say hey, stop rise interest rate as that will hurt economy? No, when bank need to rise interest rate, they have to rise and many other set of circumstances.

iirc, BTO prices are set by govt but is based on lower end of the surrounding resale HDB prices. Something like that. 

in a crash there will be no demand, surround resale HDB prices will drop. And as you mentioned, the condo benchmark will drop. So private will also fall.
 

Govt putting in recent measures to prevent bubble are good moves to control prices.



 

Can help explain 3 generation flat with an area of 1237sq ft with 4 bedrooms and 3 BATHROOMS; cant imagine how small the rooms would be
 

To encourage multi-generational living, a new type of HDB flat will be introduced in the September BTO exercise. Three-Generation (3Gen) flats will have four-bedroom configuration with three bathrooms (two en-suites) within a 115 sq m (1, 237.86 sq ft) space. Applicants must, of course, form a family nucleus making up of at least a married/courting couple and their parent(s).

So far as long as regional crisis sg govt shud be able to react and wont let property price drop
 

Pls have a faith with MIW, they r paid millions for nth 



 

Its the same, I think property bubble will burst due to world economy, and like I said government is no magic wand. Price drop will be beyond what government can control. So when people always say government will not let it happen is really an understatement as things do not work this way. It is the market forces that decide on something and not government intervention that decide on it.

I sense a lot of bitterness here.
 

Your friend knows which way our economy is heading.
 

For you, if you are really passionate about engineering, you can always try working for European or American MNCs. 
 

Lots of highly qualified (with elite US degree) PRC engineers did that.



 

No la. . I am already past  that self pity phase
 

Anyway I hv already done well enough by investing wisely to be confident about myself

But I do sincerely concern about the future well being of my staff

That's what I trying to say, so government has no say on property market will not crash. So when people say government will not let it happen, please think about it. Market forces come into play.

What govt do is to ease like relaxing the rule, which will reduce the impact. 

And talking about market, after experiencing 2009 crisis, u think when property drop cash rich people will still do nth? Sure they will jump in to get few units

I feel what government do is always 1 step late. Meaning the TSR should be implemented in year 2009 or year 2011 latest, but they did not do it until recently. So by that, with so many years on going. How many people will be affected when property market crash?? A lot people, and the domino effect will come into play. Government has no control on that, and when market crash, those cash rich may also has some other investment if they have to settle, plus by then no demand, will they dare to jump in ? Some yes, some no. Plus it's already known that SG debt to savings ratio is getting higher, so when crash come, it will impact even more people and more jia lat. So with this happening, go blame on government? No ma, as one choose to take the risk, as some people may say no risk no gain, but downside is the risk is high and still many want jump in and take the pie. So good luck lor.
 

One thing that people may have notice, no matter what government do, government will never beat market forces. Like the cooling measures that had been implemented many times over the past few years, Market forces still win government. So when crash, it will be the same. Market forces will win the government. So as a heads up.   :o
 

* So anyone still dare to say government will not let crash happen?? Yes government will do it best to not let it happen, but ultimately market forces will still win government no matter what.

Was wondering why people keep saying government will not let property market crash la, or what so familiar sentences? I mean to be fair, government has no control 100% how property market will perform, it is purely base on demand and supply. Yes government can implement new rules and regulations that can affect buyers or speculators decision, but ultimately it will still depends on market forces.
 

The point here is that, there will be many that will be in denials, thinking government will not let crash happen are, crash will not happen are, or whatever sort of reasons saying crash will not happen. But it will happen in future no matter what base on fundamentals of what goes up must come down, plus low interest rate will not always stay low forever. Go think about it. Good luck to those who go in late, normally people very funny go in late ( time the market ) and when crash, blame on everyone except ownself, is it fair ? It's a fair game, if one want take the risk, and when market crash, please don't blame anyone they could think of, but blame onwself for making a brave decision or wrong decision.




Your views r true if theres easy credit. But with 50% down, its a very strong safeguard

As I feel government always one step behind market forces. As the duration for implementing a solution may take sometime and market conditions can change very fast one. Government cannot keep up with the pace. So go with the flow and see how lor.

Singapore got sound fundamentals meh ?  10years ago yes , everybody work hard for their takes . Now , I everybody dont need to work , just be landlord better profit ! Productivity drop to all time low , capital flow to the wrong type of trades and to the wrong people . Too much money park in properties is not good for general economy, it does not generate enough biz activities and job creation. You call these sound fundamentals ?  




Welcome to capitalism, where its not the hardest working that makes the most money, but the ones who know how to make money succeed. Those who were smart enough to invest back then are sitting pretty today. The good thing or maybe bad thing about capitalism is there will always be ppl working for the rich. So not everyone has the luxury of being a landlord. Its a title reserved for those rich enough to buy properties.

How property price can drop so much by 50%? Now the LTV rule for 2nd timer already 50%. Govt has protect those late buyers already anything happen just increase the LTV back to 20/30%. So even crash maybe only price correction

dont underestimate the richness of sporean and regional richies who want to park their money in spore during time of uncertainty

dont underestimate the kiasuism of sporean

dont underestimate govt reserve to spur local demand and economy
 

i wont deny property market will correct if there is a mojor downside in world economy

but a crash like 1997 (asian financial crisisi) and 2003 (sars) ... highly unlikely

I would say it is possible or may even be worst than that. Look at how much $ been printed nowadays as compared to 10plus years ago and you take that as an multiplier effect.   -_-
 

The ups and downs is getting steeper and steeper and the duration of economy cycle is getting shorter and shorter.

If u held the belief its going to be quite bad, then that means theres going to be a crash, which means ard 50%. U dun need to know magic numbers. Its either correction or crash and since u say its going to be bad, then its a crash. If u have a 'i don't know view', then that means it can be either good or bad, which contradicts yr earlier viewpoint.

i agree with alessio rastani ... be prepared and take opportunity

if there is a crash ... 

buy your dream car with $1k coe like in 2009

buy your dream home now $1000psf at $600psf ... 40% discount

load up your dream blue chip ocbc at $5 now at $10
 

crash is opportunity.

Look at the way govt do things nowadays.  Really cannot put blind faith on them believing they are superman who would come  to rescue and help control the price so that the property will not crush onto you.
 

Agree about your point.  Has been keeping cash and will load in once that opportunity arrives, it will.

I don't agree or disagree with your view and it is correct to a certain extent. 
 

I used to be a optimists or a pessimist when come to view but not anymore. Why worry and be overly bearish or be overly bullish when our view is always 50% correct or wrong as the outcome is simply up or down...
 

Nowadays it's planing for contingency plans... Is rise, what's the action. If drop, what's the action. If lose job what's the action etc etc.

Depends what is your 50% lah.. 
 

Jurong/Clementi pte to go back to 700psf.. is very possible. You can say that's 60% drop compared to Jgateway.. 
 

As spoken earlier.. i think that price will moderate to 

700-800psf for OCR (LH),  800-900psf for FH/next to mrt

800-900psf RCR (LH), 1000-1200psf for FH/next to mrt

1000-1200psf CCR (LH), 1400-1500psf for FH/next to mrt
 

HDB will hover ard 300psf - 600psf
 

% drop .. depends what is the price you are comparing too.

What market forces ? Government decides the market forces.
 

With BTO price at 300ks and so forth , how to can the market crash ?
 

those with BTO bought at 300k will 5 years later sell 500k .with the profit, there goes the cash for downpayment for that mass market condo 1m-1.2m 
 

and the cycle goes on n on. If the market turns bad, EASY. Take away the ABSD,SSD,PR whatever..the market will shoot up again. The next peak is always higher then the previous one.
 

Price correction in the short term yes (has to be, due to so many restrictions), Over the long term, upside still there .
 

Think about it, if you are a rich chinese man, where will you park your money ? 
 

Malaysia , other SEA countries (politically stablilty ?)

USA & Europe (Travel Distance , Language , Culture differences ?)

Australia, NZ ( Any capital appreciation potential ?)

Hong Kong, Japan ? (More EX then Sg now)
 

Figure it out...

anyway alot of pple seem to thk that if prices crash, garmen will remove FT prop taxes, dont u thk theyre taking a big political risk if they do that n backfires when mkt recovers n even more pple not happy w FTs/PRs pushing up prop prices? So ure saying watever happens p@p is screwed?

Overall property price index. Of course there will be variations around the districts. Jgateway's existing psf is also different from Jurong/ Clementi pte so we have to compare based on existing psf rather than developments cos new and old are always priced differently. 
 

For eg, Jgateway is drop to 1200psf, that's not a crash. Anyway, SG market is quite uniform, all link to Raffles place. So cannot be Jgateway drops 50% the rest drop 10%. There'll be variations but more or less in the same range.

60% will die die vote pap. Last election so obvious but they still vote. PE so obvious still around 30% vote TT. 
 

Govt controls election dept, press and determine GRC boundaries. How to lose? 
 

If Man U controlled English FA, they will determine referees, venue, fixture...so how to lose? But it's not. Anyway, i'm still sore Man U lost yesterday.

The problem today is the spending rate is getting higher as compared to savings rate which is getting lower and lower. When there is too much of credit debit, you will know the country is in trouble. 
 

Ask you all this question, nowadays credit card is so easy to get as compared to 10plus years ago. I mean to have sound fundamentals of money is to have high savings rate, in order to produce. 
 

So ya, I still stand my view point, when crash happen, it will be far worst then one can imagine ( where many thought only slight correction la, no need worry ) ...   -_-

i simply see it as govt controls too many situations such that they will always win. 
 

Remember the msia cup days. Even when SG is good, we don't win but once awhile we get to win. anyway, a oppo victory is not to form govt, but to prevent 2/3 majority. if that happens, then i can say pap lost. but pap is trying very hard not to let that happen.

the thing with these kinds of predictions is it can go either way. so it's always easy to predict doomsday. U can try googling US stock market, economy collapse 2013 and u'll find prominent ppl predicting it. If US collapse again, then what happens to us? More QE again?

your way is not exactly based on fundamentals cos you're investing nothing. A good way is 50-50. Keeping a 50% cash portfolio and investing the rest, in case things work in your favour. It's also a good hedge. 
 

A 100% cash portfolio is losing cos if things rise, then you don't get to make while someone else does. There'll always be that crash one way or another but holding power ensures the next high will be higher than before. And when its low, you can use that 50% cash to invest.

Unless this chart is inflation adjusted to compare dollar for dollar in real terms.

It can look scary.

1997 to 2013 is about 15yrs. 

You will need to adjust that by a conservative 30-40%
 

In other words we are no any better in real terms 97 to current.

Coupled with a much bigger loan book, doesnt look fabulous
 

Anyway I dont care about which analyst say what.

I am currently zero debt, ready cash and liquid securities.

I am kiasee, prefer not to be the last one standing.

anyway alot of pple seem to thk that if prices crash, garmen will remove FT prop taxes, dont u thk theyre taking a big political risk if they do that n backfires when mkt recovers n even more pple not happy w FTs/PRs pushing up prop prices? So ure saying watever happens p@p is screwed?




gahmen will remove or reduce property tax but most important is now the loan rule has been tightened, those late buyers will still protected when crash occurs. they may not need to top up cash amount as they already dp high.
 

when crash happen, dont panic, dont sell ur property, can hold then hold, cannot hold jialat lor

your way is not exactly based on fundamentals cos you're investing nothing. A good way is 50-50. Keeping a 50% cash portfolio and investing the rest, in case things work in your favour. It's also a good hedge. 
 

A 100% cash portfolio is losing cos if things rise, then you don't get to make while someone else does. There'll always be that crash one way or another but holding power ensures the next high will be higher than before. And when its low, you can use that 50% cash to invest.



 

Actually do you guys know why 2008 crisis is not worst off then 1997 crisis?? It is because of USA intervention that start printing massive amount of $ to prevent massive crash. That is why the crisis seems like quite fast recover. And do you guys know that the GDP figure is not that accurate?? Here is the link.. http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/breakout/gd...-111727893.html . Government always want to portray that everything is okay, but in fact it is actually not that good. And by right inflation should be way much higher than what it is announced due to the inaccurate GDP figures.  During year 2008 crisis at least still has printing press and economy recover. What about the next crisis?? Will printing press still work?? I don't think so as look at zimbabwe, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean_dollar . 
 

Printing press only temporary stops the problem and does not solve anything. Because the world still very much rely on USA, that is why the inflation is brought to whole world, Singapore is also affected, like the property bubble and that is why SG government is trying their best to stop property price from rising too much, but as you all may see the measures is still not enough as it still rise at quite high pace. So imagine with no cooling measures in place, and can you imagine the amount of $ USA print that can cause such rise in property prices in SG even with so many cooling measures in place?? 
 

So the music will have to stop, I mean soon sooner or later things will come to the end of either USA go onto massive printing to a state of hyperinflation or USA stop printing press and default on loan. There is not way out, either way it does economy no good. So now you guys know why I say next crisis coming will be far worst than one can imagine?? As the effectiveness of printing press will be lost due to it has been used in year 2008 and it won't work in the next crisis. That is also the reason why, there is minority of people keep saying it's good to start looking to buy gold now, as precious metal is good hedge against inflation. All the best.

Yes.  more free money / liquidity in current account .. better position to 周轉. I quoted the article doesn't mean I agree with it though. Don't think more reserves in the form of foreign credit (as mentioned in the article) is necessarily better .. what happens when USD stop printing and default on loans ? Who pay for the continual growth ?

Regarding how it will affect SG property prices, of coz it will. If next round of printing and crash do not happen, then expect property price to continue to shoot up even higher, unless SG government put in even more fierce measures in the future.
 

If US default on loan, then no need say, property price will sure crash. No one will want to buy and want to sell off, plus rising interest rate put in even more stress among those who do not do their maths well and calculate solely base on the current interest rate now. Yes there is still rental income, but with bad economy, do you guys think people are willing to pay as much as it is now for rental?? Some may even have empty spaces due to cannot find people to rent their house/room, and that adds in liability.

That is the problem, that brings in inflation to the whole world. It just need a few big players to realise that they actually don't need USA as it is a liability not an asset and withdraw from it, then good luck to those whose country that holds the most reserve in US currency.

If buyers have holding power, it will be ok.
 

more crucially is massive job losses cos when ppl lose jobs, they can't pay off their loans without rental income. As per MAS, i think 5-10% are in the risk bracket in case lose job. The current guys who pay 50% down can easily rent cheap. So it all boils down to jobs, income and holding power. 
 

If really crisis, will 5-10% of buyers be able to crash the market (at least 40% dip)? i think that's difficult tbh

It's possible, why not?? Look at year 1997 history, where HDB prices selling at 700+k before the crash, and when it crash, how much drop is the HDB prices ?? And by looking at in context of property price now, some HDB house sells at slightly more than 1million, a drop in 50% to 500k when crash is very possible.

I think our gahmen worries the most about keeping the MNCs here in Singapore to keep the jobs and rental market (including office space). MAS will continue to allow SGD to appreciate to curb inflation, but also making it more expensive to invest here. Electorates want EP and PR reduced, don't think that will happen - now you can see they only target those S-Pass and WP which affects the local SMEs more.

Ya, the good thing is SG government actually let SGD appreciates and not depreciates. Yes it is more expensive to invest here, but in long run if business man sees that it will be worth to invest here as they just need to tong for and set up business long here, the exchange rate will favour them.

Didnt u read that our loan deposit ratio is back to 1990s high? Just as loose then.  There was resales gains tax in 1996 or 98. Also back then we we didn't have a huge cheap floating debt bubble n interest rates were higher which is a "cooling measure" naturally. Now asia has yet to unwind the credit bubble....

But i do think there's a fundamental human instinct that we have. It's easier to talk about fear and convince us about fear, rather than the opposite.

US Debt



 
 

great article.
 

There are few reasons behind the hyperinflation in Zimbabwe. Money printing was obviously one of them. But they also experienced a substantial drop in their production capacity during that period of time due to wrong economy policy. from wiki
 

"In the late 1990s, the government instituted land reforms intended to redistribute land from white landowners to black farmers to correct the injustices of colonialism. However, many of these farmers had no experience or training in farming. From 1999 to 2009, the country experienced a sharp drop in food production and in all other sectors. The banking sector also collapsed, with farmers unable to obtain loans for capital development. Food output capacity fell 45%, manufacturing output 29% in 2005, 26% in 2006 and 28% in 2007, and unemployment rose to 80%.Life expectancy dropped."

i look at it the other way also. Why people join on the bandwagon is the fear of losing out. I won't say there is no fear on a bull run. the fear is of losing out.

lol very philosophical lah. I also don't really care.
 

Just have a 5 year plan and adapt accordingly.

I agree with what chucky said. Just have a plan. then put your money or take it out accordingly.

yup they rather up GST and change CPF rules than touch corp tax. but they r jus going to b smacked on both sides of the face. jus ask ard how many backend offices of MNCs and banks have shifted to MY, PH and India. the one trick pony is dying and they are stil trying to flog it.
 

as for SGD and MAS, it wil only b maintained, not appreciate. they stil need to balance the export side of things. look, US has been printing USD 85b every mth and yet SGD act kept pace.

but d mkts always acts d other way rd, tats y stock mkts always go up on long run. mkts climb wall of worry.
 

when pple have no fear n start saying a certain asset will never crash (eg. SG prop), that is when theres reason to worry.
 

its sentiment n fundamental mixed together




it will def fall. just a question of how much. so it's not exactly a bad time to buy property, just need to have a long term view. I know it's not cheap. But that's what ppl told me back in 2007. 2008 they laughed. then u know what happened.

Ya definitely will fall, but don't know exactly how much. But don't expect slight correction as the fall will definitely be more then that.

No matter what.. property is still maintaining the current price.. no 1 million no talk. Dont see much of any downtrends in the pricing. Only when there is a finanical crisis, the pricing will be adjusted else... as long as the private condos are still moving and the demands are there... wait long long

As long as ABSD and SSD is there, landlords will rather take 2% yield than pay the gahmen 10% ABSD or 4-16% SSD. Limited existing stock release to the mkt = low supply = high price.

what hyperinflation ? From the beginning of QE to the end of QE now, these fear-mongers have predicted hyperinflation from time to time. Now, uncle Ben want to close shop liao, where is the hyperinflation? It is the time to stop these nonsenses.



 

USD still have not experiencing hyperinflation is because the world is tanking USD as reserve currency. Wait till the big players realise that they will be better off without USD and start switch off the tap and you will see how bad USD is going to depreciate against world currency. So those who still have mindset of USD will recover can forget it as it will never happen.

Property bubble now printing everywhere, it just needs a sharp catalyst to pop. But on the flip side, the bigger it grows, the louder the "pop". Errrrr... I meant BOOM!
 

Actually, the fact there are still ignorant people (denying the risk) means the bubble is very well alive. We need more people to think there isn't a bubble when there actually is for the bubble to sustain. These people form the thin outer layer of the bubble.

Fraser Centrepoint not small time developer lah.

6.9m by 2030: still got more than a million people coming to our shores.

Our very ambitious 3 new mega-townships will only yield 40k units.

More than a million people coming.... 40k units.  How can?

Can see or not? Undersupply lah!

Demand high, supply low = price high high high high high high

Plus Khaw oredi said supply is to taper...

Good luck folks!

Unless this chart is inflation adjusted to compare dollar for dollar in real terms.

It can look scary.

1997 to 2013 is about 15yrs. 

You will need to adjust that by a conservative 30-40%
 

In other words we are no any better in real terms 97 to current.

Coupled with a much bigger loan book, doesnt look fabulous
 

Anyway I dont care about which analyst say what.

I am currently zero debt, ready cash and liquid securities.

I am kiasee, prefer not to be the last one standing.

Good luck folks! 



 

You should take this opportunity to sell your landed lah bro.

Idiots are now paying crazy stupid money for non-prime location landed properties. Properties that were unwanted and ignored by the market during saner times.  Last time those opera estate, upper Thomson properties nobody even wanted to buy. Today, $4m plus for a semi-d that is in original condition in those areas. Siao boh?

So place your bets, sell your house. When market crashes you can buy a bungalow in D10 with the same money.  If it crashes.

not much chance to think like that. Banks ask for 50% down so want to take risk also cannot.

u don't acquire, your competitor does. Your competitor becomes richer when the market picks up. 
 

To me, it's a down market now cos few can afford 50% down. thats y property transactions plunge. 
 

Some places just don't know what is cheap. Look at Euro crisis. Is Monte Carlo cheap? 
 

All i can say for certain is income gap gets wider. SG is a place for the rich. The middle class find they cannot afford these properties. It's a harsh reality.

Thought government make changes that developers can only hold a period of x numbers of years ( is it 3 years? forget how long ) and no more then that. So unless government go change that when economy turn bad, it does not make sense to bid so high now in my opinion.

Now the only thing that prevent market crash is the QE. Once QE stops, the music comes to an end. Will QE aka printing press continue? How long can it last before big brother realise that USA is a liability that only export inflation ?? Both ways it will just affect the economy, but the letter is more dangerous as by then don't know how much more $ has printed and will impact even more jia lat.

Must also hold the right currency lol. SGD should be relatively safe. Ya savings over spending is more prudent, back to basic is good.
 

And that is the reason why there is minority of people keep saying buy gold and silver now as it will continue to rise due to cheap monetary policy. As history has shown that gold is a good hedge against inflation.

Another 5 years??? Wait till coming Oct see how Obama will say about to raise debt ceiling again, if not it would be economic armageddon. The thing is what will SG government do when debt ceiling is raised again? I mean hope sg government will realise that the printing press brings higher inflation then what they can imagine and not put in ikan bilis measure, as it will not work well and should put in even more fierce measure. More fierce measure although is painful for people to shallow, but when economic crisis hit, the impact will not that big as inflow of $ to SG is limited. So limit inflow of printed $ to sg will be the best solution to tide over this period.
 

So it is actually good news if debt ceiling is raised again and SG government still managed to reduce property price and not let it increase, as learn to fall down now is better then don't know where one is going and fall down over the cliff further ahead.
 

But the opposite will be if debt ceiling is raised again and SG government do not put in more fierce measures or find that the current measures is enough or even relax the ruilings and let property price continue to rise, can you guys imagine when economic crisis hit 1 to 2 years down the road, it will be far worst then one can imagine lor.

As long as ABSD and SSD is there, landlords will rather take 2% yield than pay the gahmen 10% ABSD or 4-16% SSD. Limited existing stock release to the mkt = low supply = high price.



 

all boils down to holding power. if no tenant for months or hv to start topping up monthly, those holding multiple ppty wil start to let go 1 -2. the other thing is when int rate increases, u put ur money in FD u prob can also get 2%pa. why stil need to bother w pesky agents, tenants haha
 

the other thing I shared before URA data shows 100k completed units to hit market until 2016. this is excl BTO and new HDB. supply is def there. in the booming 09-12 years, sg can stil attract FT cos companies willing to pay. but now, its really quite different now. im looking to buy a ppty but im def not going in now.

this is the same argument that many tv host debate with alesio rastani
 

alesio rastani advocate buy during crash when economy is not doing good ... stock market crash ... property market crash ... a $1M property can be bought at $400k-$500k
 

tv host argue when economy is in dire state  ... who dare to spend $500K and most people already worrying about their job and how to put food on the table
 

when economy is high ... everyone is feeling high and many bought property at the PEAK because the "future" looks awesome ... typical cycle

You should take this opportunity to sell your landed lah bro.

Idiots are now paying crazy stupid money for non-prime location landed properties. Properties that were unwanted and ignored by the market during saner times.  Last time those opera estate, upper Thomson properties nobody even wanted to buy. Today, $4m plus for a semi-d that is in original condition in those areas. Siao boh?

So place your bets, sell your house. When market crashes you can buy a bungalow in D10 with the same money.  If it crashes.



 

Yes very siao prices and very tempting to sell.

But as you know me, i dont play with my primary residence.

The location is really tip top (imo) with a great view.

And now my eldest is getting into a school nearby next year.

Moreover its fully paid and i have enough cash to buy another.
 

I have already made my move as you know, by selling my D9 condo two months ago.
 

With all these things happening, it really pushes middle class Singaporeans like me to consider "quitting" the country.  Who knows , maybe i really will.

Must also hold the right currency lol. SGD should be relatively safe. Ya savings over spending is more prudent, back to basic is good.
 

And that is the reason why there is minority of people keep saying buy gold and silver now as it will continue to rise due to cheap monetary policy. As history has shown that gold is a good hedge against inflation.



 
 

Gold in itself, no point.

deep inside, everyone wants to quit but wil keep pushing off due to kids education, parents. 

but seriously in another 10 - 20 yrs, tat wil become a reality and this is wat MIW should seriously watch out for.
 

they can continue to import cheap immigrants, discreet coerce them into converting citizens. but the core citizen is wat tat matters - the very social fabric of Singapore. and dun forget, as many as 30% of total renounced citizens are these 'new citizens' who are jus using sg as stepping stone, temporary stop gap to the gahmen's policies.

It's possible, why not?? Look at year 1997 history, where HDB prices selling at 700+k before the crash, and when it crash, how much drop is the HDB prices ?? And by looking at in context of property price now, some HDB house sells at slightly more than 1million, a drop in 50% to 500k when crash is very possible.




I remember for some 5 room hdb in mature estate, they weresold for 380k in 1997, after AFC, can get at 260k onwards. From 1999-2005, price is 310-360, after 2009 onwards it's 420-550k.. thats for eunos bedok.

And that's why the govt is not stopping the import of white collar PMETs and encouraging them to become PR and citizens, instead they are stepping up the import. Because they know that the current local middle class WILL quit working and quit the country one day.

They are tapering import of cheap FTs but have they stopped import of middle class PMETs? You know the answer.  Why haven't they? Because they are hoping this group of FTs will replace the Singaporean PMET middle class who will eventually cannot take it and quit.

Only pple like me stuck in SG and waiting for MIW to bleed me to death slowly... 
 

Sidetrack. I just checked with my agent friends...Now property demand really slow down. My friends got time to take off on a weekday somemore.. usually agents are busy. Also confirmed that during the peak, rental for a condo can be 1.2 to 1.3 per room.. but now.. 950 also no takers... All say can eat grass liao...

Hi bro, which country would be a likely destination should you one day decide to "quit" Singapore? 
 

Personally I feel Singapore is "peakish" at the moment in terms of currency strength and the economy. Thus those who have the resources at this point in time are really in a very good position and have a wide range of options available.

Yes, Australia is surely on the list of many who are considering emigration.
 

With the advent of technology, perhaps one day the concept of a global citizen may very well come true: homes in multiple countries and a career that does not really require one to be fixed in a single location the whole year round.

but the main thing now is companies are on bearish mode themselves. in the past they dare splash on attractive expat packages so these FTs come, work and rent aptm but now, its quite diff.
 

as for the average Singapore PMET as long as below 45yo I thk stil easily employable. but above 45yo I thk the reality is not really very bright. talking mainly average ones.

Hi dude, i really really dont know yet, honestly.
 

Really like Hawaii main island.

A very decent 5000sft landed house fronting the Pacific Ocean can be had for usd1.5mil 

Just 30 mins drive from Honolulu and Waikiki.
 

I have been there a couple of times over the last 25yrs and the vibes are great.

Not the cheapest place, however i like it as it is pretty efficient yet easy going.
 

Even if i do it, it will only be a holiday home. 

My heart is still here as it is.

Hopefully SGD will be synonymous with "as good as gold".

But strength and stability of SGD depends on many things, most importantly our GDP.

And GDP depends on so many factors: human resource, economic stimulation (construction), etc

So I hope that people will stop trying to prevent the Govt from doing what it needs to do to keep SGD strong.

The govt does many things in the interest of the stability of the currency and the national economy. We as layman and not in the inner circle are not privy to it, and we should just shut up and let them do their thing.

I thk 2 reasons. one is the world is so mobile now and the nearby cities hv caught up much. cmon, I thk the old towns like bedok, tampines has become old compared to the new asean cities on offer now. 2ndly the strong SGD and strong "HDB asset program" plus the moving goalposts of CPF could jus sway the borderliners to quit and retire elsewhere.

This group also values security and the fact that Singapore is more efficient than many other places on earth.

The so-called "brain drain" has been happening since the '90s.  That's when Goh issued a warning to be stayers and not quitters. We Singaporeans did not heed his words, continued to migrate in droves, and that's why they have started to take action by importing "talents".  You can't blame them.

MAS has been extremely concerned about high inflation as that limits their arsenal of weapons to boost the economy. These concerns, coupled with those on the bubbly state of asset prices, had given rise to the cooling measures for both properties and cars.
 

Now that inflation is somewhat kept in check, MAS should be able to weaken the SGD progressively without knocking inflation sky-high.

I guess.. for those 45 and still have problems should already make plans of settling in other countries.. cheaper housing, simpler lifestyle..
 

If I have the chance to choose.. I rather dump the pink IC and get the blue IC.. same benenfits. Its a joke that we really treated like a outclass when we are truly born in SG.. Joke

Yes weakening the SGD will make Singapore more competitive in trade. While at the same time causing inflation.
 

That aside.
 

Our govt's concern about SGD strength is paramount.  They will try to balance SGD and competitiveness, without losing the attractiveness of SGD.

You are forgetting that we are no more a cheap manufacturing exporter.
 

We are a banking and financial centre now.  We export financial services and import cold hard cash and make money for our stakeholders/clients in a strong currency.  A strong SGD is in our interests. Why do you think the CHF has remained (somewhat) independent?

Bro, Singapore is not the only city that experience brain drains.. looking at other developed countries, they have done so much better than what we have done. We cant stop pple from leaving but we can persuade pple to stay. 
 

The only problem is .. Our governement is not doing enough to make pple feel that we are part of the nation. Their only reason.. GDP. High GDP overwrites everything until in the recent yrs. .they start to wake up after losing popular supports and bad ratings in the recent elections..

Persuade the ever-demanding Singaporeans to stay?

How?

It is not possible to allow everybody ownership of a high floor apartment with a sea view in a mature estate, nor is it possible to allow everyone to own a car.  It is also not possible to give everybody's kids a place in an elite school.

So tell me lah, how?  How to satisfy Singaporeans?

True true..everyone have demands.. I am just stating that MIW should have a clearer guidelines over PR and Locals.. My circle of friends are leaving not because of sea view apartment OR not able to own GCB.... They are more disappointed with expectations that our government have over the locals... 
 

No money.. just work till 75 even as cleaner.. also gd. They forget when u are 75.. u must say thank you to the gods if someone even want to hire u.. not everyone so lucky as MIW.. just sit and go swimming in morning.
 

Give free transport for rides in MRT or Buses... still need to see timing and also not applicable in all stations somemore. Look at China or Taiwan, the elderly above 60 GOT free rides..
 

Medical subsidies.. not much diff as the PR until recently ... Lasttime.. everyone is joking abt how well our government is treating the PR than the locals.
 

Sick... no problem.. go stay and get well in JB loh.. CPF allows deductions there.
 

No job Oppt... blames yourself cause u dont bother to upgrade or expect high salary.. Our government forget that our salary had not increased over the last 10 yrs as compared to inflation..
 

Maybe u different lah... U rich and u dont see how the poor lives in Singapore.. .. I different.. I see how the poor is like cause I am being poor too . I floor cleaner only

buy $260K and sell $550K ... that's what everyone is hoping for

however, how many can buy when economy is going downhill and property is crashing ... that's the big question
 

i'm sure many have heard of the latest JB property so called Danga Bay

i have a couple friends already flocked to Danga Bay and said how cheap is RM$800k-RM$1M for a seaview condo (ie: RM$1M = < SGD$400K)

in spore ABSD alone probably cost > SGD$100K

buy and left it empty also good if no tenant (ie: wait for capital appreciation)
 




I remember for some 5 room hdb in mature estate, they weresold for 380k in 1997, after AFC, can get at 260k onwards. From 1999-2005, price is 310-360, after 2009 onwards it's 420-550k.. thats for eunos bedok.

50% loan only started few months ago. Think about the buildup over 8 years and you will get the picture.



 

prices started peaking significantly only from 2010. so it's not exactly 8 years of build up, prob 3-4. As MAS said, 5-10% are at risk and i suspect, they have at least 2 loans worth at least 70% of what's borrowed. 5-10% is perhaps not enough to crash the market in a crisis.

Thought government make changes that developers can only hold a period of x numbers of years ( is it 3 years? forget how long ) and no more then that. So unless government go change that when economy turn bad, it does not make sense to bid so high now in my opinion.



 

iirc, they can hold for as long as they want but theres some penalty involved. not sure if need to be 100% sold too.

Those on reports selling at 0 cov must have read this, I read Liao also sb scary

Can really feel the critical moment Liao  



 

there are various reasons y HDB dwellers want to sell at $0 COV. Maybe some already bought their next home & die die must sell. Do note HDB transactions are not always reflective of economy. It's a need and the reasons can be so varied. The private market would be more representative if we have massive transactions selling at much lower prices. But as employment rate is high, that's unlikely to happen.

this is the same argument that many tv host debate with alesio rastani
 

alesio rastani advocate buy during crash when economy is not doing good ... stock market crash ... property market crash ... a $1M property can be bought at $400k-$500k
 

tv host argue when economy is in dire state  ... who dare to spend $500K and most people already worrying about their job and how to put food on the table
 

when economy is high ... everyone is feeling high and many bought property at the PEAK because the "future" looks awesome ... typical cycle
 

but so many people bought property at historic high prices, bubble burst will bring alot of hardship to singaporean families



 

the very same ppl who advocate crash then buy are unlikely to buy. Say all they want but when your job is at stake, you're unlikely to do anything. 
 

That's why there's this saying. High, u don't buy. Low, you also don't buy. When u want to buy?

So now cash is king? Savings over spendings..... 
 

If it's to come, it wun go away

We jus got to face it bravely  



 

there's a fine line between investing and spending. Cash is always king provided some of it is used for investing.

Must also hold the right currency lol. SGD should be relatively safe. Ya savings over spending is more prudent, back to basic is good.
 

And that is the reason why there is minority of people keep saying buy gold and silver now as it will continue to rise due to cheap monetary policy. As history has shown that gold is a good hedge against inflation.




SGD safe? USD crash we are in trouble too

Persuade the ever-demanding Singaporeans to stay?

How?

It is not possible to allow everybody ownership of a high floor apartment with a sea view in a mature estate, nor is it possible to allow everyone to own a car.  It is also not possible to give everybody's kids a place in an elite school.

So tell me lah, how?  How to satisfy Singaporeans?




it's in our genes to migrate. we are after all migrants. 
 

as there's little space here, those who can of course will leave. 
 

but it's not all rosy elsewhere. To me, it's still good to make money here. But i cannot say the same for retiring and kids education.

You are right that the reliance on manufacturing to contribute to the national revenues is diminishing. However, at this point in time, it still is a substantial contribution so there is a bias towards weakening the SGD if political and economic factors permit that to happen.
 

As a banking and financial hub, the SGD only needs to remain as predictable and stable as possible i.e. minimal volatility and not so much of being relatively strong since much of investment upside for most financial instruments are derived in other dimensions.
 

CHF is a slightly different kettle of fish compared to other currencies since the exchange rate is no longer fully free-floating (semi-pegged to Euro). 
 




Yes weakening the SGD will make Singapore more competitive in trade. While at the same time causing inflation.
 

That aside.
 

Our govt's concern about SGD strength is paramount.  They will try to balance SGD and competitiveness, without losing the attractiveness of SGD.

You are forgetting that we are no more a cheap manufacturing exporter.
 

We are a banking and financial centre now.  We export financial services and import cold hard cash and make money for our stakeholders/clients in a strong currency.  A strong SGD is in our interests. Why do you think the CHF has remained (somewhat) independent?

buy $260K and sell $550K ... that's what everyone is hoping for

however, how many can buy when economy is going downhill and property is crashing ... that's the big question
 

i'm sure many have heard of the latest JB property so called Danga Bay

i have a couple friends already flocked to Danga Bay and said how cheap is RM$800k-RM$1M for a seaview condo (ie: RM$1M = < SGD$400K)

in spore ABSD alone probably cost > SGD$100K

buy and left it empty also good if no tenant (ie: wait for capital appreciation)



 

That's buying a property on someone else's land. 

Unless you have confidence in their government and legislation....Malaysia,   I dunno.

If by 35, you see that you're not going anywhere, better quit liao and do something else.

I agree with you... If the region goes into recession, will the mega size Idkandar or Danga Bay project will ever be completed. Singaporeans forgot how many empty uncompleted buildings there are at Malaysia and Thailand after 1997 and 2001..  and what happened to all the non Malaysian investors that invested in CLOB shares..

if not due to TDSR, buyer would have paid $100K-$150K more for a 1000 sqft unit for nothing?
 
 


Developers trim prices as new reality bites
New launches priced below expectations as buyers struggle to secure loans
 

[sINGAPORE] The impact is now there for all to see. Developers have been trimming launch prices for new private residential projects to adjust to the new market reality in the aftermath of the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) framework's rollout in late June.
 

A case in point is the 445-unit Thomson Three condo in Bright Hill Drive, being developed by UOL Group and Singapore Land.
 

"Without TDSR, we could easily have priced this project at $1,500 psf on average, or even higher. We now expect to price it at a more realistic level, at $1,350-1,400 psf," said Liam Wee Sin, president (property) at UOL.
 

The showflat of the project, located at the Upper Thomson Road/Venus Drive corner, will open this weekend, although sales booking will begin two weeks later, on Sept 20.
 

"Notwithstanding the recent curbs (TDSR), we still see strong underlying demand for private homes and the overall economic outlook has been more positive recently. However, with TDSR, buyers are now more selective and sensitive to the total price quantum, so developers have to be more realistic in their pricing," he added.
 

The TDSR rules require financial institutions, when granting property loans to individuals, to ensure the borrower's monthly total debt repayments do not exceed 60 per cent of his gross monthly income.
 

Downward adjustment of developers' earlier pricing expectations is also set to surface for two condo projects where sales begin today - The Skywoods in the Dairy Farm area and The Glades in Tanah Merah. All three projects are 99-year leasehold.
 

For Skywoods, "we were looking at nearly $1,300 psf on average pre-TDSR but we'll now release it at $1,250 psf", said Neo Tiam Boon, group CEO of TA Corporation. TA is developing the 420-unit project with Hock Lian Seng Holdings, King Wan Corporation and Far East Distillers. "The issue today is not that there are no buyers. There are a lot of interested people who want to buy, but they could not get a loan.
 

"Conservatively, I estimate possibly one-third of those who saw our showflat couldn't secure a bank loan," he added.
 

All eyes are also on Keppel Land's The Glades, near Tanah Merah MRT Station. Earlier, agents had been giving average price indications of around $1,400-1,600 psf. KepLand declined to comment on the pricing yesterday.
 

Nearby, Fragrance and World Class Land launched Urban Vista in March, achieving a median price of $1,503 psf in that month. "May be KepLand will price Glades a tad below $1,500 psf," suggested a property agent, although there were whispers earlier this week that the pricing may be closer to $1,400 psf, given the challenge of moving the sheer number of units in the project - 726 apartments. "Most of the demand in the Bedok South/Tanah Merah area has probably been sucked by eCO and Urban Vista," said the agent. eCO, along Bedok South Avenue 3 and further away from Tanah Merah Station, was released in September last year, achieving a $1,283 psf median price in that month.
 

As developers start lowering their expectations for new launches, it is just a matter of time before this has an impact on earlier launches, acknowledged industry players.
 

Knight Frank chairman Tan Tiong Cheng said that of all the cooling measures in the past four years, TDSR has the greatest impact. "It dampens buying as a result of difficulty in getting loans, though interest rates generally are still low.
 

"As a result, developers who have already geared up to launch after the Seventh Month are all trying to find the right pricing level," said Mr Tan.
 

"Most people can still get loans; just not the quantum they want. As a potential buyer, I have two choices. One would be to compromise and buy a lower-cost or smaller unit. Or if a developer is seen to have dropped pricing from earlier expectations by 5-10 per cent, it may entice me to commit," said Mr Tan.
 

A seasoned observer reckons that token cuts of 5 per cent or less may not do the trick in most cases. "But if we see price drops of say 10-15 per cent, a lot of people will get back in to the market."
 

Mr Tan expects prices of projects launched less than six months ago to come down to match the new launch prices. "For developers with existing projects on the market, once sales stall, the correct strategy, which some are adopting, is to temporarily close the showflat, as leaving it open will worsen sentiment.
 

"They can then reopen a few months later and adjust prices to the new level," said Mr Tan.
 

UOL and SingLand paid nearly $720 per square foot per plot ratio for the site of their Thomson Three project. The breakeven cost could be around $1,150 psf. Absolute prices in the project start from $672,000 for a 495-sq ft one-bedder.
 

The development, near the future Upper Thomson MRT Station, will include 10 strata semi-detached houses priced at around $3.4-3.5 million each.
 

"There's a lack of supply, and pent-up demand in this vicinity. The recent ruling quashing Thomson View's en bloc sale will mean tighter supply in this micro market," Mr Liam said.
 

Separately, UOL last night clinched two wins at the Fiabci Singapore Property Awards 2013 - for its Parkroyal On Pickering in the hotel category and Double Bay Residences condo in Simei in the residential (high-rise) segment.

Give the guy a break. He's trying to sell property, of course he would wish more people can buy, as long as the banks can lend. Do you think he cares whether the buyer can afford to keep up payments to the bank?

That's why there's this saying. High, u don't buy. Low, you also don't buy. When u want to buy?




Buy high lor, recently bout a unit and down 60%

Hi dude, i really really dont know yet, honestly.
 

Really like Hawaii main island.

A very decent 5000sft landed house fronting the Pacific Ocean can be had for usd1.5mil 

Just 30 mins drive from Honolulu and Waikiki.
 

I have been there a couple of times over the last 25yrs and the vibes are great.

Not the cheapest place, however i like it as it is pretty efficient yet easy going.
 

Even if i do it, it will only be a holiday home. 

My heart is still here as it is.

The entire monetary system today is fraught with financial wizardry and sleight-of-hand in any case; how does the USD retain its relative strength when the country is close to the bottom of the barrel in terms of its huge borrowings and economic problems?
 

It all boils down to its military strength. Military prowess has always been, and will always be, the key determinant of a country's dominance in the world.
 

The planned/orchestrated crash-and-recovery of the US economy is just one small part of the bigger script. Without the downs (which the big boys also make money from), where would the ups come from?
 

The same applies to Asia so we better be prepared for something big coming our way.

Conspiracy theory....  I do sense something big coming, anyway, we need a crisis to make money every few years.  This one may however hurt more people due to debt build up over the last few years.  The good times can't last forever.

The massive debt build up during the US bubbly years have been written off, reduced and or moved onto the govt books, this has allowed consumer spending to gradually recover and the economy to grow (US economy is largely dependent on consumers).  The govt debt overhang (it is still not at the highest level historically) can then be winded down gradually as revenue grows.  It is the economy, stupid.
 

With the largest and most powerful military in the world, noone will pull their lines, at least not in the next 10 to 20 years.  While we have international laws and UN... when push comes to shove, the guy with the bigger gun will win, that is the reality.  
 

US don't care about the impact QE has on Asia, so if they need to stop the printing press and pull money out of the system, they would, you die, your problem.

Indeed. With Lawrence Summers coming on board, we should be prepared for hawkish policies (read: aggressive tapering) coming from the US Federal Reserve.
 

India is teetering on the edge. The new RBI chief has the next two weeks to perform. If he fails, the shorts will come fast and furious. The only saving grace this moment would be the BRICS Forex pact. However the technical difficulties make that ineffective in the meanwhile. If India cannot be defended, it will be the trigger for the next Asian Financial Crisis.
 

Indonesia is the next favourite target for the shortsellers. With or without India, Indonesia is going to be hard-hit. In 1997, it fell after Thailand. This time around, it may be the first or follow India should the take-down succeed.
 

It is time to bunker down. Those with loans need to lock in their borrowing rates for at least the next three years to weather the storm. Interest rates will rise rapidly once the whole thing starts. Asset prices will dip with urgency. SGD, along with the rest of the Asian currencies, will weaken significantly. Hopefully SGD does not play catch up with the rest of the Asian currencies.
 

Look to the US (and Europe within the next six months) to hedge using your excess funds.

I concur with you observation on the engineered meltdown
 

US bankers have a lot of historical memory in tweaking the money system to their advantage

when Nixon drop the gold standard in 1971, Kissinger with his art of diplomancy. convice the Saud royal household, leader of OPEC to price oil in USD in 1973, considering a few months eariler US had just backed Israel in the Yom Kippur war against the Arabs...

then US started to distance themselves from the Shah of Iran, evetually leading to his overthrow by the fundementalists

Pricing oil in USD wasn't enough to stabalise the dollar, what they do... put Paul Volcker as the Fed chief, and hike interest rate to 20% in the name of fighting inflation...

When the Japanese caught up in industrial might with the Americans, convince the Japan US business council to push the Lourve and Plaza accords which sow the seeds for the property bubble burst in Japan...
 

don't underestimate the US financial wizardy
 

after witnessing the US Fed power to print, you seriously think Lehman need to collapse meh?

Yes, and with more countries moving away from USD and starting to price their trades in their own currencies (e.g. China and Russia, China and Australia), the US is hard-pressed to implement new strategies/means of preserving the relevance of the USD.
 

Thus Asia has to fall in order for the US to buy herself more time and the war with Syria is not without its purpose.

Thus Asia has to fall in order for the US to buy herself more time and the war with Syria is not without its purpose.



 

like I said earlier
 

when Saddam price Iraqi oil in Euros in 2000, 2003 he was toppled

when BRIC met to discuss displacing the USD with Euros in 2009, Eurozone debt crisis broke out

now is time to settle scores with BRICs with financial warfare

Please don't depend on MCF alone for news. Reading one story does not convey the actual story.
 

The $10 billion loss was in the press in July. This was a unrealized loss, just a snapshot at a point in time.
 

And MAS would not have only held on to one currency only even if other currencies were weakening against the Singapore dollar.
 

In simple words, if you changed S$1000 a few months ago to ringgit, you would have RM$2450. If you did not spend the ringgit and wanted to change it today back to Singapore dollars, you would get back only about S$953. (@2.57). So you would have 'lost S$47'
 

But you would not change it back as you will spend it in Malaysia or keep for the future to gamble in Genting or go for massage in JB. So you did not really lose anything.

Please try to think beyond simple laymans understanding that a loss is a loss in the context of Central Bank policies.
 

For an investor, a loss IS a loss no doubt
 

For a Central Bank, things are different
 

Firstly read MAS explanation of Singapores currency policy
 

--------

Box Item 1: Features of Singapore's Exchange Rate System

Since 1981, monetary policy in Singapore has been centred on the management of the exchange rate. The primary objective has been to promote price stability as a sound basis for sustainable economic growth. There are four main features of the exchange rate system in Singapore.

First, the Singapore dollar is managed against a basket of currencies of our major trading partners and competitors. The various currencies are given different degrees of importance, or weights, depending on the extent of our trade dependence with that particular country. The composition of the basket is revised periodically to take into account changes in Singapore's trade patterns.

Central Bank policies is beyond the scope of this forum so I will not go on much about it
 

But briefly, 
 

There are other reasons besides trading gains/losses over a short term for their policies
 

Even IF they were traders, no sane person would put all their funds in one or two currencies that they think might go up (and the amounts of money involved would preclude this also)
 

High growth currencies could be in volatile countries and that is not a game for a Central Bank to play. So there is a limit to what currencies we can store our funds in.

Ok explanation over , now you can revert back to f--king the PAP and telling everyone Government no good and lost all our CPF money.
 

Tharman was selected to be Chairman of the IMF policy committee, but I am sure he is very stupid compared to all the potential Central Bankers here in MCF

wah lau how can you pre judge me....

so far I never advocate buying gold
 

I don't think the fiat money system is going away any time soon,

is money created by legal fiction, can expand/contract at will 

and charge interest for borrowing it, unless there is a global movement that target bankers,

I doubt it's going away any time soon



 

Well. . Your nick suggest that mah.. 

My portfolio consist of some gold and silver bars and coins. .. but is only a little of my overall. Dunno if I should increase them.. 

When rupee lau sai, my kah kia's family from india asked them to buy more gold using the sgd they earn here

India also tried to curb their domestic gold demand with higher tax.. gold price shot up in india..and worth more rupees
 

Dunno when sgd becomes weak, will this also happen.

That is why I said what if big brother, suddenly relalise that USA is a liability to them and without USA, they would be much better off. I mean look at how much currency they have printed just to buy up US treasury, and the inflation that It causes. But one thing good about China is the large population, land and resources, and if China turn off tap to USA, at least they still be able to produce and provide to the whole world. But many are still sceptical on China product, but for sure they will catch up and may overtake other countries in terms on branding and cost in the future.

That is a loss to me, no matter what you called it.  
 

Perhaps you can explain such gains and losses are part and parcel of central bank P&L and MAS is at least not selling USD to buy SGD to defend SGD, it however does not want too strong a SGD (managed float) that is detrimental to our exporters, it is a good problem.

after allowing DEBT culture to run wild for years and now start to kancheong ar?
 

$200+ millions bad debt written off is sup sup water la ... mai kancheong 
 


By Kevin Lim 

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore announced new rules on Wednesday to cap credit card and other forms of unsecured lending by banks, amid growing concerns about rising household debt in Asia by consumers once known for their thrift.
 

Asia has seen consumer debt levels rise sharply in recent years due to low interest rates and aggressive lending by banks.
 

For Singapore, the ratio of household debt to gross domestic product now stands at around 75 percent, up from 55 percent in 2010 and 45 percent in 2005, according to data compiled by Standard Chartered.
 

"The rise in household debt is a fairly generic trend across Asia," said Selena Ling, head of treasury research at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.
 

"From a macro-prudential point of view, you'd want to mitigate the increase in household debt, particularly with respect to unsecured loans."
 

In Asia, household debt levels are highest in South Korea and Malaysia, followed by Thailand, while Singapore is somewhere in the middle of the pack, she added.
 

Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimated in a recent report that household debt in South Korea stood at around 88 percent of GDP at the end of March this year. The ratio for Malaysia was 80.5 percent, while Thailand's is 77.5 percent.
 

Singapore has already taken steps to cap borrowings for property purchases, while Thailand's central bank has warned about rising household debt and a possible credit bubble, although it backtracked slightly on Aug 21 by saying it was less concerned about the high level of borrowings by households.
 

Credit Suisse said in a recent report the household debt situation in Malaysia, Korea and Thailand are more worrying than in Singapore and Hong Kong, where the level of financial wealth is also high.
 

"For these two countries, the ratio of household debt to financial assets is 13 percent on average, compared to an average of 48 percent for Korea, Malaysia and Thailand," the Swiss bank said in its recent report.
 

In Singapore, the changes to the rules on unsecured lending will to be implemented in stages from Dec 1, and they include limiting the total amount of unsecured loans an individual can take to 12 times that person's monthly income.
 

The changes are "aimed at improving lending practices by financial institutions and enabling individuals to make better borrowing decisions", the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)said in a statement.
 

Singapore, which has a population of 5.3 million, had 9.3 million credit cards in circulation at the end of 2012, up from 8.3 million at the end of the previous year. Banks wrote off S$226.6 million in bad debt last year, an increase of 21 percent from S$186.7 million at end-2011.
 

But people in Singapore, which has more millionaires per capita than any other country, also own lots of assets, so the debt-to-asset ratio in the city-state is low relative to other Asian countries.
 

Currently, it is relatively easy for banks to issue credit cards in Singapore, with lenders such as Citibank advertising that they are able to do so within 24 hours of receiving an application.
 

But with the new rules, banks will be required to review a borrower's total debt and credit limits before granting a new credit card or unsecured credit facility. Banks must also carry out such reviews before increasing the credit limit on such facilities, the central bank said.
 

"Most borrowers of unsecured credit should aim to stay well within the 12-month limit, as such borrowings typically attract high interest costs," MAS said, adding that it is monitoring the situation and will lower the limit if necessary

which bond is it arh? Plenty of REITs trading equal or higher recently. As rates rise, the yield spreads will grow in correlation. im watchin this carefully.
 

Short term looks like US POMO tapering is priced in already, but longer term spreads shld grow again.

ha ha .. the bond quite safe lah.. backed by Temasek...you shld know which bond liao. 

Traded in SGX.. shld easy to redeem.. but it will come with a big lost.

And of course,  $$ is slashed in different investments, not just bond alone. Some in AUD FD.. which i no eye see now. :P 
 

i not so rich to buy a million dollar house which i can pay in full..  But it's a cash reserve that could pay up to 70% of the loan. :)

err.. bond can just wait till maturity and get back principle.

REITS is like stock..if it drop like hell.. it may stay there forever..
 

then again, maybe i too stupid to understand how REIT is calculated. I adopt the practise .. dun understand dun buy.

Now people's knees are not shaking yet, must loon.
 

When the tapering fading and reversal of this one sided unsustainable monetary policy, experience tells us that something big will happen.  Get ready......
 

When we faced a similar situation the last round with subprime staring as our faces, we also didnt believe that something big was gonna happen.
 

Good or bad, i leave it to your imagination.

But i rather not take my chances on the bull side for now....

Maybe later but not yet.

Actually the more measures MAS put, you should get less worry as that would reduce the impact should economic crisis were to happen. I mean if MAS did not out in so many measures, what do you think will be the price of property now? The only thing that is not good is because to me MAS will always be 1 step slower than market as market forces changes very fast. I mean to implement something takes time, and by the time it is implemented, it will already be so far slow behind.

I am worried because I think they are behind the curve and are now trying to catch up, hence the supposedly new permanent measures (debt service ratio and cap on unsecured credit) in the last 6 months or so....

It is reported that those who are thinking of refinancing might face problem. For those who got their loan few years back,now might be thinking of refinancing becoz paying 2 over percent interest rate now. When they face difficulty refinancing to lower rates due to the tdsr,they will be stuck with high interest rate loan. 
 

Rental softening and the higher interest rate is e perfect storm at the door step already. Those who buy few years back also cannot sell due to the ssd. So caught in a tight position. Sell now also cannot due to ssd,sell later also scare cannot sell and rent. Those with property still under construction even worse with their money stuck with no returns.

who is more guilty?

borrower or lender (lack of regulation on unsecured loans)

in hk movie we always see when a gambler lost all his capital, magically a good friend will come and lend him money ... 
 

similarly lehman brother toxic bond

yes, no one pointing a gun to the greedy people to buy these bond but selling the toxic bond aggressively is as guilty

Who is more guilty?
 

Those who are in debt will say the lender is more guilty  (so many cases already with the casinos)
 

Those who are no in debt will say the borrower is guilty (so many here who are oon oon chiak bee hoon)
 
 

So which side do we want to be?

Do we want to be told whether we can do this or that?

Can we take responsibility of our own finances?
 

Those who buy a car priced more than their half year salary obviously cant unless got cash behind pahpah

combo of yellen likely new Fed head, DJIA & SPX technicals not overbought short term. mthly SPX chart's RSI hasnt hit d falling resistance line yet, means higher prices soon IMO before a solid fall. Big crash is def coming it cld mths before any action so meanwhile its bullish until then. My view is strictly macro, doesnt apply to insider trading by SGX penny ctrs lol

I mean the whole world now too rely on $ printing and want more, if reduce, the impact will sure be felt and the propaganda of US is recovering is just government do some tweak in how it derive and calculation does not reflect the true reflection on what is actually happening but just wanted to show the good figures so the world still have confidence in them, but sooner or later the picia will sure lobang.

That is the problem with most of us.
 

Without the job and income, how long can we survive?
 

I call this "hand to mouth" living.
 

A never-ending cycle that is difficult to break out of, a kind of modern slavery.
 

We should all try to cut down on spending and start saving more than we spend.
 

That means, save 70% of salary, spend 30%.
 

Fark the sports car, fark the big house, fark all that unnecessary s--t that you don't need.
 

The problem with us Singaporeans is that we are all too caught up with spending future money, wanting bigger better and more expensive stuff that we can barely afford.  And by afford, I don't mean installments.

one thing about hdb.. so far very few get chased out and left homeless..still got MP to kau peh to  

but can't say the same for condos..
 

my personal rule of thumb is to survive without income for at least a year with the same spending  

but of course, if i really kenna pok, those spending will be cut to stretch further..till i find another one.

someone tell me "money velocity" isnt slowing down in SG... its not that we're making little, its coz asset prices have run way ahead of fundamentals until we actually feel poor even tho we havent lost our jobs. Asset = equity+liability... IMO d liability gone up too much hence d 100% HH debt to equity... 
 

My own formula: sentiment+fundamental = asset price. Tell me where sentiment is right now...
 

If d banks decide to keep pushing up valuations to increase equity values, its d greatest sin they'll to consumers as come a big crash, these same bankers will b reducing valuations faster tahn u can spell v-a-l-u-a... we dont have d HDB resale flat undersupply situation of 2008 anymore...

 Velocity of money has been on the rise so much so until what was excessive is now normal.

So when the reversal happens, its clear what result it would bring.

Its whether the reversal will happen fast and furious or whether it will happen slow and steady.

Regardless, it will happen.  So get ready and prepare for 3%pa - 5%pa type loans in the next few years.
 

Like the story of the ant and the grasshopper.  Dont wait.  Buffer up now.

No difference, only thing is when it crash, USA cannot use the same method of printing $ anymore. As it has been used, and the world will not buy it anymore. It will be a game changer where such a world richest nation in the world in the past is destroyed by massive currency printing.

Sort of help to protect Singapore Financial system and also people like us. I mean it indirectly does affect people like us who is looking to buy property and cars. 
 

But it is something weird that government need to come up with so many measures just to stop banks from being too loose in $ lending. So what does this means??
 

It simply means banks don't care whether people can afford to make repayment or not, all they want is to make $ the fastest and grow the fastest, the rest talk later.
 

So I think the whole financial system still had not learn the lesson on year 2008 crisis, banks and other financial institutions are too busy trying to earn as much profit as possible and neglect on fundamentals
 

So in a way government step in is good, but like I said, government always 1 step too slow to the market.

One way is to know whether SG government is 1 step behind market is just by looking at Straits Times forum page, when people write about bubble forming, banks too loose in lending and many other loophone that government had not step in yet. That is a ringing bell that indirectly saying well, market forces changes very fast and government just cannot keep up with the pace due to need to go through so many layers for approval before things can be implemented.

3 Reasons Why Developers Can Sell At High Prices
 

point no 1 & 2 is the MOST LETHAL ...
 

1. The advantages of market domination

The property developer industry is an oligopoly. It is dominated by a few big players which are often large conglomerates.

The entry barrier for new players in this industry is exceptionally high. With limited supply and high cost of land, it is not easy for small developers to raise sufficient funds or obtain financing from the bank. They also cannot compete with the big guys in terms of branding and their track record in past projects.

Bigger players have stronger financial muscle to build their own land bank. They can drive construction of projects in time to capture a booming market. They enjoy the benefits of economies of scale or cost leadership from a large number of ongoing projects. They have a handsome budget for marketing and for leverage to hire a good marketing agent. They have enough cash reserves to hedge against poor sales during bad times.

It is therefore not surprising to see a high percentage of private housing projects all supplied by the top few developers. The advantages of market domination allow them to set their list prices at the highest possible level and to reap a huge profit.
 

2. Collaboration among big players

The big players have good connections amongst themselves to make the most of a mutually beneficial partnership. They can collaborate with each other by forming joint ventures to bid for land parcels, to secure borrowings from banks, or to diversify their investment.

Among the top property developers, they can seek consensus and alignment on many decisions, for instance:

• When to launch or re-launch in a quiet or recovering market;

• Which type of projects to launch in different locations; and

• What projects to hold back to avoid unnecessary competitions for similar projects.

When they are setting prices for a new launch, they don’t have to make reference to the average transacted prices of existing developments in the same district. They can benchmark against each other’s list prices in other districts in order to set their prices at a new high in a hot market.

Of course, no developer can move new properties off the shelves without the support of local banks to provide buyers the necessary financing. It is not uncommon to see developers tying up with a few banks to offer housing mortgage packages to buyers at the sales galleries.

In order to secure business from home buyers, banks work with their valuers to ensure that the valuation of the uncompleted property matches with the selling price, so that they can disburse the exact amount of housing loan required by the buyers.
 

3. Willing sellers, willing buyers

In the past few years, property developers have paid a high price for land parcels sold by the government or from en bloc sales. Likewise, the tight supply and spiraling costs of construction manpower and building materials have taken a toll on the bottom line of developers.

It is arguable that developers have no choice but to markup considerably to ensure their profitability, although how big a safety margin is reasonable is entirely up to their discretion. After all, if they don’t make hay while the sun shines, who can tell what will happen when market direction changes?

In the end, the matter boils down to market response and customer acceptance. Developers can’t sell new flats at future prices if buyers are unwillingly to pay a premium price.

It doesn’t matter whether the selling price is twenty or fifty percent higher than the most recent transacted price of a resale flat in the same area, so long as everyone believes that the market price will be even higher by the time the new flats are ready for occupation.

Believing in the future – that is the magic pill of getting buyers to pay future prices in a booming property market!

It depends.. 
 

http://www.munknee.com/foreigners-beware-u...s-are-alarming/
 

I mean there are bonds that are going to mature, so what's next?? Will they reinvest in US treasury?? If no, what happen?? How will USA going to pay huge bills when they themselves already at the edge. Print $85 billion per month is not enough to pay off trillions dollar of bond mature. What about other expenses ?? So let's wait and see will China and other big players to continue print $ to buy up US treasury, if yes, then it would be a good 2 years, if not.. that spells the trouble.. or alarm..
 

http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/da...aspx?data=yield
 

And what is worst is the maturity rate is at pathetic 0.13% for 1 year maturity. I mean it would be better off putting $ elsewhere but US treasury.

yes, usa is yaya papaya ... they are also pulling everyone nose to walk together
 

like titanic ... usa will say i die you all die together ... wahahaha



 

I don't think all will die together with USA, as China so big country, can produce a lot of stuff, Brazil, india, and so many country, without USA, economy will sure suffer for many years, but after that it will back to good years ahead then.

Fed No Taper means US dollar becoming Zimbabwe dollar ... 

if Fed don't dare to taper means the economy is worst than what it is seen

if economy is recovering, taper should have kicked in liao
 

print $85 billions a month x 12 months x years = ?

even taper to $75B or $50B ... still printing billions per month

My take is that US need to print more and more to sustain their spending debts. 
 

To keep QE stable at the previous amount is actually, in effect, a form of tapering in itself. 
 

Hence, everything will not chiong and we may well see economy downturn still.

With the recent announcement to delay tapering of QE, I see it as the last opportunity/time buffer  to cash out all my stocks holdings  before they come crashing down.

It will happen.

When they stop QE, only when they think it will not crash...
 

Unlike Lehman Bro when everyone is not sure what the gov will do to save the mkt and how far it will go... It's very clear now that they will stop at nothing...
 

The message that U/S is sending is loud and clear... U/S mkt cannot fail and the world leaders will do whatever they can even if its against morals and logic..*all the protest at wall street is useless* US gov are with the bankers.

Cash is undervalued when it is of most use.
 

When you fight a battle and runout of ammo.

No matter how well you plan, you will be a sitting duck unless you get your hands on more ammo.

Let the enemies fire, use up their ammo.  

Once their firing is done, we will take charge.
 

Anyway, i'm just a small timer looking to retire a few years earlier, thats all.

battles are not won by ammos alone..... remember 赤壁一战.

What seem to be dead end ... may just be a turning point.
 

Expect the unexpected...
 

the thing is muz be willing to let go of your old belief and move on.. "restart"

Alot of ppl are struck with the belief that the pty mkt will crash since 2010... and still refused to let it go..
 

Some may think that i am flicker minded.. 

Every period post different things.. Not that i dont believe in myself.. but i always like to "think" from the beginning again.

A decision for FED can change the game overnight.. so keeping a open mind is impt.

You got it wrong, they are not the enemy.

The whole concept strategy revolves around we , ourselves.

Not sure if you understand.

Lets just say, we are our own enemy and we are just fighting against ourselves most of the time

If you read carefully 
 

" This is despite the fact that as at March 2013, consumer debt in mortgages, credit card billings and study loans have increased compared to last year. Only car loans saw a drop in outstanding balances during the period under review. " 
 

So which means it still not healthy as all debt had increase except for car loans ( due to no choice, cannot take higher loan ) 
 

Unless it drop across whole board, it's not good news anyway.

what a day difference made ... conflicting message
 


SINGAPORE: Credit Counselling Singapore (CCS) estimates that as many as 30,000 borrowers could be under distress, from tighter restrictions on credit card and unsecured lending. 

But based on data from Credit Bureau Singapore (CBS), the credit health of Singapore consumers has improved from a year ago.
 

One possible explanation is that even as consumers borrow more, they have become more responsible in managing debt.

All crap news.
 

Simple formula.

==========

Cant pay credit card bills and need to rollover debt = distressed.

Use one credit card to cover another = distressed

No salary for one month will put you in debt = distressed

Need to sell Rolex to fund for medical = distressed

Forking out $20k in cash will break your bank = almost distressed

2nd time buyer... got to put in so much SD and still can buy.... also dun need to worry abt them..
 

The world leaders already make their point that .. they will never let interest rate or anything to crash the mkt.

So it will be fat hope that hike of interest rate will come soon.

Hard to find condo unit under $1,000 psf 

Buyers more focused on total price tag than psf cost: Analysts
 

Published on Sep 21, 2013
 

By Melissa Tan
 
 

IF YOU think it is near impossible to pick up a mass market condominium unit for under $1,000 per sq ft these days, you could be right, as recent statistics show.
 

The majority of suburban private home transactions were above that price level in the second quarter of this year, according to Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) data compiled by property consultancy OrangeTee.
 

The numbers underline a trend that has been increasingly apparent for the past two years - buyers will shrug off high prices on a per sq ft (psf) basis as long as the overall quantum is seen as affordable.
 

That seems to mean paying up to $1.2 million for a suburban private home, consultants said.
 

Out of 3,627 mass-market private units sold in the three months to June 30, 2,180 were above $1,000 psf.
 

That is 60 per cent, a starkly higher proportion than the 25.5 per cent recorded in the second quarter of 2011, when 1,188 out of 4,368 suburban units were sold above that price point.
 

The proportion of units costing more than $1,500 psf has also climbed dramatically, from 0.5 per cent in the second quarter of 2011 to 14.2 per cent in the same period this year.
 

Recent condo launches in the suburbs have notched up astronomical psf prices.
 

Take the 738-unit J Gateway in Jurong East. It was launched in June and its units have been sold for as much as $1,774 psf.
 

That price was paid for a shoebox apartment of 484 sq ft at the 99-year leasehold project. It works out to $858,000.
 

At the freehold The Tembusu in Kovan, which was launched last month, the highest price paid was $1,687 psf for a 474 sq ft home or $799,000. The 337-unit project saw more than 200 units sold on the first day of sales.
 

"It appears that home buyers today are no longer concerned with the unit psf prices as long as the total quantum is within their reach, either for investment or their own stay," said OrangeTee research head Christine Li.
 

"The high psf prices could remain for a while longer, given the land prices developers have paid over the last year."
 

The URA is launching two adjacent private residential plots in Upper Serangoon View with the same tender closing dates before the end of this month.
 

Releasing sites in a batch like this is part of an experiment to moderate land tender bids.
 

Its previous experiment, conducted in July with three executive condominium plots that were not adjacent, ended up smashing price records.
 

However, it is not just psf prices; total price quantums have also gone up even as unit sizes shrink.
 

"Three years ago, $1 million could buy you a 1,000 sq ft three-bedroom unit," said PropNex chief executive Mohamed Ismail.
 

"But today, even though three-bedders have been reduced to 800 sq ft, which is already a 20 per cent drop in size, if it costs $1,350 psf, you'll be paying $1.08 million."
 

Knight Frank research head Alice Tan said the "sweet spot" price level for first-time home buyers was in the range of $950,000 to $1.1 million.
 

"We could see some resistance for prices beyond $1.2 million," she added.
 



Mr Ismail reckons the psychological ceiling is around $1.5 million for a mass-market home. The highest suburban mass-market condo price this year was $1,920 psf paid in April for a unit at Centro Residences in Ang Mo Kio. It works out to $1.9 million for a 1,001 sq ft apartment.
 

Consultants expect suburban price increases to be more muted in the coming months due to dampened buyer demand on the back of mortgage restrictions introduced in late June.

An American bank director (in white shirt), who declined to be named, leaving The Sail @ Marina Bay last Tuesday after a one-month stay there. He said his company arranged for the accommodation and he did not know the lease was illegal. -- ST PHOTO: DESMOND FOO
 
 


By Joyce Lim 
 

Two weeks after The Sunday Times reported that the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is investigating the illegal short-term leasing of apartments at The Sail @ Marina Bay, a check has found that such leasing is occurring at the waterfront condominium.
 

Several websites continue to blatantly carry advertisements of units available for short-term leases at The Sail @ Marina Bay.
 

The Sunday Times responded to one of the advertisements on Sailatmarinabay.com, with a staff member posing as a foreigner and indicating an interest to rent a one-bedroom apartment from Oct 1 to Oct 31.
 

In an e-mail reply, a customer service and sales employee quoted an "Executive Deluxe City View" one-bedroom apartment for a discounted price of $7,200 nett a month, and an additional $500 payable for one with a view of the Marina Bay area.
 

When The Sunday Times team turned up for the viewing on Sept 12, it was shown two units located on levels 14 and 17 of Tower 1, and a third unit on level 16 of Tower 2, which offers a partial view of the Marina Bay area.
 

A lease agreement was later presented, stating a leasing period of six months starting on Oct 1, even though the team said it was keen to rent it for only a month.
 

The employee, who went by the name "Ewan", explained that the law requires the lease contract to be for a minimum period of six months. However, he pointed out a clause in the contract giving the option for early termination on Oct 31.
 

The contract could be terminated after one month, assured Ewan.
 



A search on the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority revealed that Sailatmarinabay.com is owned by Bergen Associates Group. Its managing director Peter Leung, a Singapore permanent resident, is a resident and a former management council member of The Sail.
 

When this reporter later revealed her identity to Mr Leung and questioned him on the short-term lease, he declined to comment.
 

Under URA's guidelines on leasing and subletting of residential properties, it is illegal to lease such properties for stays of less than six months.
 

URA has said that if investigations establish that a residential unit is being misused, the person responsible may be fined up to $200,000, imprisoned for a term of up to 12 months, or both.
 

A URA spokesman told The Sunday Times that URA has received seven complaints over the last couple of weeks and added that "investigations are ongoing" on the unauthorised use of the residential units at The Sail @ Marina Bay.
 

Last year, one resident, who wanted to be known only as Mr S. K. Cheah, terminated his leasing agreement with Bergens Associates Group after he found out that his apartment was allegedly being subletted, which was not part of the agreement between the two parties.
 

The 53-year-old investor told The Sunday Times: "I had three different people staying in my apartment in three months. So I decided to do a spot check one night, and I found out that my apartment, which was leased to Bergens Associates for $4,500 a month, was sublet to another company for $8,500 a month.
 

"I would not let my unit be leased out illegally as a serviced apartment."
 

But tenants of The Sail @ Marina Bay may not be aware that the apartments have been illegally leased to them on a short-term basis.
 

The Sunday Times team met an American couple as they were checking out from the condominium last Tuesday. The couple arrived in Singapore last month and had stayed in a one-bedroom apartment on the 47th floor from Aug 19 till then.
 

The husband, a director in a multinational foreign bank here who declined to be named, was shocked when he was told that it was illegal for the serviced apartment operator to lease the apartment to him for only a month.
 

He said: "The accommodation was arranged for me by my company. The whole place looked like it was for corporate rental. I didn't know that it was illegal.
 

"The services provided by Marina Bay Service Residences were excellent. Their staff were very dedicated and helped me with everything including arranging for my transport and booking a tennis court."
 

In 2010, URA investigated about 1,000 cases of the unauthorised use of private residential properties, which included short-term stays and the unauthorised conversion of private residential properties to workers' dormitories or boarding houses.
 

By last year, URA saw an 80 per cent rise in the number of such cases to 1,800 cases. In the first seven months of this year, there were about 980 such cases, similar to the number seen in the same period last year, said its spokesman.
 

URA told The Sunday Times that it has not charged anyone in court for illegal short-term rentals thus far "because home owners typically comply with our requirements to rectify the planning infringements when they are notified".

ok. LAW is for people who know how to play, play it nicely
 

just like with 50% downpayment and 5 years loan for car 

hearsay, got company offer lease for 5 years ie: $0 downpayment and OPTION to buy the car after 5 year at a pre-agreed value when the lease start

technically is to circumvent the 50% downpayment and 5 years loan

at the end the owner still can buy a car without 50% downpayment and 5 years loan maximum

Good luck developers!  
 

So the impact of rising rates will be far greater than we think.

If measures remain in place, developers have only one card to play.  PRICE.
 

And it has to be low enough, otherwise market still wont move.

Try paying 10-18% stamp duty on a $3mil property.

Thats equivalent to a brand new Carrera gifted to Govt...
 

Haha, i aint gonna do that.

developer has a DEADLINE to sell all units right

at 11th hour of the deadline ... got FIRESALE bo? ... ammo is ready



 

Dont underestimate the influence from business on politics...All over the world , banks and developers exert the big influence on government policies.
 

Capitalland is not allowed to failed at home one lah..;)
 

Lifting the restriction is one way out for the developers... Another is for the government  to give excuses like "to better utitlies completed unit" and allow these developer/service apartment operator to rent out these units as service apartment after TOP. And wah la, developers will be saved and make alot of more. ;P 
 

At the moment, all the big business are complaining abt staffing as well as accom for their oversea staff.. Government will need to look into rental supply soon after hdb prices stablised.

I remember those days when the papers was flooded with condo ads.

Those were the days that there were no many buyers.

Also the attitude of agents tend to be much better.

When sales are plentiful, they become rude.

Not too different from some hawkers who are very rude be os they have a long queue of customers.

Yes you are right.

Money (success) changes people.
 

By the way, the property market largely manipulated by the agents by pushing prices beyond where they really should be.  Just like how COEs are pushed up by dealers.
 

Otherwise how can the same house marketed by two different agents hv a $250k difference in price?

So obviously, the agents simply mark a huge buffer before advertising.
 

Therefore, when buying we must not be paiseh to take a big chunk off our offers.

Its very clear, showroom full doesnt mean sales are good.

Usually grand opening time showroom surely full.

Full of all kinds of people trying to get freebies. 

One of Singaporean pastime is to visit condo showrooms.

Buy or dont buy just visit.

Also car showrooms.
 

Then after two weeks of launch, showrooms become quiet.
 

I pass by a few cluster house development, 2yrs later still for sale by developer?!!! Wtf?
 

D'Leedon still 25% unsold.

Skyhabitat, more than 50% unsold...

So many few yr old condos under $1100psf in better locations.




 

Aiyoh

Sometimes i cant help but shake my head....

Marketing the brand is for long term loyalty.  

Good products mostly only market brand, no need to advertise to sell 

Product sells on its own driven by market
 

Advertising to sell is a push for sales

Product wont sell on its own, must give freebies, must encourage buyers, must discount etc.

Driven by seller.
 

Good luck Singaporeans!

Sales for Sky Vue condo in Bishan off to a flying start with more than 400 sold
 


Sales for CapitaLand's Sky Vue condominium in Bishan got off to a rocking start with 410 of the 505 units released for sale on Saturday sold by 7pm. 

Two-bedders, with an average price of $933,000 per unit, proved the most popular among buyers, said the property developer in a statement.
 

CapitaLand chief executive for residential properties, Mr Wong Heang Fine, said the firm was encouraged by the strong support from homebuyers and investors. "Most of our buyers are young couples who appreciate the well-articulated layouts and lifestyle amenities of Sky Vue and its proximity to the Bishan MRT station and Junction 8 shopping mall," he said.
 

The average price for all the units sold on Saturday was $1,500 psf. One-bedroom units and two-bedroom suites went for average prices of $750,000 and $1.15 million respectively, while the average price of a three-bedroom unit was $1.58 million.

Not fully sold?  
 

Nowadays they like to tzechar the market by showing the psf.  

Dare not emphasis the unit sizes. becos small like a pea.  
 

What is a two bedder?  700sft? Thats like the size of three toilets add together.
 

The true test is not at launch but what happens afterwards.

i would even speculate that the mass market condo that is priced at 1500psf for 1001sqft at $1.5M could drop >30% to $1M

the million dollar question is see who blink first

just look at the Thomson V report in ST ... many speculators bought the shoebox shops and let it empty because cannot get tenant even at dirt cheap rental  ... holding power is sibei strong

there will be no firesales if there is no speculators kena burnt fingers 

real owner and upgrader will just move in and live in the highly speculated condo and pay through their nose

lookin at d SNP500 futures daily chart, a potential bear top known as island reversal may have occured: gap up then gap down is bearish (hat tip to a certain US futures trader i follow on twitter). weekly is on RSI support so if this is a bull continuation, it shld fall a few more days then reverse up again. 
 

mthly chart looks v ominous n time for a big reset but im no fortune teller so it may happen next mth or next yr who knows.

Singdollar likely to keep rising
 

MAS expected to keep stance due to inflation risk, labour tightening



                                                                                                                                        			Published on Sep 30, 2013					                                                                                                                                                      		                                                          			                                                           	                                 

By Chia Yan Min			                        			 			                                                                           

ECONOMISTS expect the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will hold steady on its Singdollar stance when it meets next month.

 That policy is to allow the local currency a "modest and gradual"  appreciation against a basket of currencies of the country's major  trading partners such as Malaysia, the European Union and China.

 The exchange rate is the Government's main tool to combat inflation -  a stronger dollar means imports cost less in Singdollar terms. But a  strong Singdollar can put a dampener on growth by making exports less  competitive.

 While economists do not expect a change from the MAS, they warn that  inflation is poised to rise after a relatively flat period, due to  escalating car prices and an ever-tightening labour market.

 Consumer prices were up 2 per cent in August over the same month last  year, marking the fifth straight month that inflation has come in at or  below 2 per cent.

 However, OCBC economist Selena Ling said domestic cost pressures from  the tight labour market are still a concern, especially on the back of a  recent announcement made by the Ministry of Manpower.

 Under the new Fair Consideration Framework, companies will soon have  to prove they tried to hire Singaporeans first before they are allowed  to recruit foreign professionals.

 They will also have to pay foreigners with employment passes more from January next year.

 "(The Government's) announcement of the Fair Consideration Framework  and the enhanced employment pass qualifying requirements suggest there  may not be any let-up in terms of the domestic labour market tightness  in the near term," said Ms Ling.

 Barclays economist Joey Chew agreed that "there are considerable cost  pressures in the economy" from the labour shortage, and inflation is  likely to accelerate towards the end of the year and into next year.

 "Producers are only waiting for the right moment to pass on the costs, for example, when growth conditions improve," she added.

 Recent policy changes that attempt to separate premium cars from  mass-market models in the Certificate of Entitlement (COE) bidding  process will continue to prop up premiums, noted UOB economist Francis  Tan.

 Mr Tan said the move has prompted many potential car buyers to bring  forward their purchases, due to expectations that premiums will be  higher next year.

 "Together with the appealing discounts given by car dealers to reduce  their inventories as another carrot for attracting new car buyers, this  renewed wave of buying may prompt COE prices to go on an upward trend,"  he added.

 A combination of these factors and the uncertain global economic  outlook mean the MAS will have limited room to manoeuvre, said JP Morgan  economist Matt Hildebrandt.

 "The global recovery remains fragile and numerous risks remain, so  the MAS does not have much room to tighten policy... Given the improved  growth outlook and expectation for price pressures to firm, the MAS  (also) has no room to ease next month," he added.

Mah Bow Tan: I didn't step down because of high housing prices
 
 

SINGAPORE - Former National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan has denied that he had to give up the post after the 2011 General Election because of sky-rocketing property prices.
 

It was time to retire and make way for younger and talented people to take over, he was quoted as saying in a new book.
 

Mr Mah is one of nine prominent Hainanese Singaporeans interviewed in the book.
 

There had been talk that he had to take the blame for rising property prices, but he did not think so.
 
 

Get the full story from The New Paper.

Look out for the new New Paper, which will be released in 3 days.
 

Time to retire
 

Mah Bow Tan had stepped down as Minister of Development in 2011 as it was time for him to retire, the former minister said in a new book published by the Hainan Culture and Heritage Research Centre.
 

In the Chinese book, Mr Mah refuted rumours that he had stepped down because of growing unhappiness over rising house prices, Shin Min Daily reported.
 

Mr Mah, who is Member of Parliament for Tampines GRC, had been in Cabinet from 1991 to 2011, and served as Minister for National Development from 1999-2011.
 

According to Shin Min, Mr Mah said that he did not have any complaints or regrets about his retirement.
 

Mr Mah also added that he believed he had given the "most precious and most valuable" period of his life to the Government and Singaporeans.

how many years can a developer hold a 99 year property before it starts to hurt?





 

never.. ha ha ha ..  FEO held alot of 99yr units in 1999 ... they continue to hold them until 2008-9, when the econ pick up and managed not sell them at 120% more that initial listing price + not forgetting the rental they earn along the long wait.
 

FEO is so confident in the resident mkt that half of seahills are not put into the mkt. Instead , they were completed as service apartments.
 

CDL/UOL no need to say la... backing are banks leh..
 

i just abt concern abt sim lian project...they may cut corners to reduce cost.
 

As mentioned before commerical pty does not look bright.. 
 

Residental is supported by a growing population and years of under estimates.. shld continue to be healthy. 

However, dun expect prices like jgateway.

not entirely correct
 

1999-2009 there was no holding period limit for non 100% singie developer
 

non 100% singie developers must sell all units within2 yrs of TOP: thats y SCGD went private: http://www.stproperty.sg/articles-property...d-fails/a/97521
 

"Developers unable to sell their units within the two-year period have to pay extension charges of 8 per cent of the property purchase price for the first extra year."

as you mentioned , developers has ways and means to pull through the tough time. They have the legal backing to wriggle their ways out.  It will take a long long time before they cannot hold on or hurt..
 

1999-2009.. was easier for them to hold. But it does not make now to hold impossible.

its not impossible, its just a matter of paying the tax..which is alot if many unsold like d case of SCGD. $70M of tax is crazy. i wldnt see it as "easy" to swallow even if its FEO. I dont know if FEO has any foreign shareholder or not, but if they do then r subject to same tax rules

already say already... what make you think that FEO cannot get away from not paying the tax.
 

They could always buy the leftover.. then they are not subject to the unsold unit tax and rent under their service apartment operation. In any case, there may other creative ways that they coudl deployed. Their top management are paid to think and come up with these solution.

yes.. you see wingtai and FEO joint-hands and bought the plot of land where now NEXUS and Floridian sits, just before 1997/8 crush. Wingtai split the land with FEO and build Nexus.. selling ard 700psf. FEO held their share of the land and build Floridian years later.. and sell it at 1400psf to 1700psf. How much did FEO earn in that bloody project ... i bet they got alot of holding power..

They could always buy the leftover.. then they are not subject to the unsold unit tax and rent under their service apartment operation. In any case, there may other creative ways that they coul deployed. Their those top management are paid to think and come up with these solution.



 

This is very true bro..When I was in the RES course, we have an UK developer sitting in the class with us. So we ask this developer this very qns. What happen if the untis cant be sold within the 2 yrs time frame. His response. They can always "buy" over the spare units using his company subsidries or sisters companies and hold it out till the market turns better.
 

This way they can avoid the tax and at the same time, retain the assets under them till the market is better. No way they will sell under market value hor...

if unsold units are 200 units x $1M per unit = $200M ... stamp duty, tax, etc all must still be paid to govt right?

yes.. you see wingtai and FEO joint-hands and bought the plot of land where now NEXUS and Floridian sits, just before 1997/8 crush. Wingtai split the land with FEO and build Nexus.. selling ard 700psf. FEO held their share of the land and build Floridian years later.. and sell it at 1400psf to 1700psf. How much did FEO earn in that bloody project ... i bet they got alot of holding power..



 

FEO confirm can hold out ... They have other businesses beside property. E.g. Hotels, Foods chain restauarants and lastly soft drinks.. Holding power.. of course have. Plus they even more smarter.. they dont get external agents to market their properties for them.. they have their internal SALES team to market and pay them like s--t... 
 

Do you know.. working in FEO as their sales executives is like a dog.... damned stressful and lousy commision

  thanks for confirmation that my idea is right.. ha ha ha.. but i think the top mgmt will have other better way to do it than using their sister company because of the hefty buyer stamp duty now. 

Then again.. i am not real estate line.. so i dun know what other loophole they can exploited.. As already mentioned, they could delist the company .. that's 1.

if unsold units are 200 units x $1M per unit = $200M ... stamp duty, tax, etc all must still be paid to govt right?



 

Dont think so bro.. As what that UK developer guy said.. they "buy" the unsold units using their "SISTER" companies.. indirectly ..it is not unsold. it is consider sold. So dont need to pay tax le...This one common trick... 
 

Left pocket out .. Right pocket in.. Our government very famous for this leh

If u check on the projects FEO have been building.. you will notice that they are not number 1 developer now. They used to be number 1 when the peak is there... but they toned down. What they are selling now are those projects leftover and they are trying to get rid of the empty units asap..
 

After the ECO..which is a big hit... everytime I see their advs in the newspaper... always the same old projects.. FEO too big to fall.. small time developers yes.. FEO have to wait a long long time before it will fall

FEO is not listed by the way.   
 

aniway.. the big developers are very selective in their investment one. Most of the land they bid for has high development potential. They just sell what they manage to sell and hold the rest until the bad time is over.. they will surely earn. 

E.g. FEO has a lot of development in amber area. The cape , silversea , the sound , the shore etc.. When the MRT is up in 15 yrs time.. sure very wang one.. So i dun think they need to worry too much if they have leftover units there.

Like MND , they could bring the malls/hotel to the property as they also operate hotel and malls. So normally, they have a few projects in the same area.

but one thing abt FEO... their project and the materials used for the condo.. all quite good. I went to see some of their projects.. impressive. The tiles, the "freebies" (oven, washing machine) all top brand.. unlike some of the cheapo projects i seen.... 
 

If I am working in FEO as their sales executives.. I properly fast hand and fast legs ask for transfer to their commerical teams.. better prospect now.. Residential .. slow like snails now

It is never a question of possible or not but a question of pain.
 

Can you cut off your limb and still survive?

Can!  But pain or not? Good or not? Want or not? 
 

So no matter what, current situation is poise to hurt them and people are willing to do many things when they are hurt...
 

No need to talk so much. 

You hv money and you think can buy at current prices, plse do lor...

Thats all.

I also looking to buy but not at b-------t price for b-------t location

Plenty of new launches available.  If you are looking for a private property home and on a limited budget, don't be worried if you cannot afford one now, you will be able to afford it later as the supply is quite good.  Let things take its course.  Govt keeps releasing new plots of land for private property, so no worries.  If what you can realistically afford may not be in the prime districts or near the city, at least it is a reasonably comfy condo with security guards, sheltered parking and facilities.  So please relax, Singaporeans, you will get yours some day!

Rental yield?  I am assuming that the so-called "sandwiched class" are genuinely looking for good quality homes for their families to live in.
 

Those who are looking to make a killing in property investment, I have no sympathy at all.  My kind wishes are not for them.
 

This is what I hate about some Singaporeans - when they complain about high property prices, are they complaining about lack of a reasonable place to live in and bring up children?  Or complaining about a lack of money-making opportunities?
 

The govt has identified these 2 groups, that is why the measures were put in force.  Weed out the speculators from the genuine home buyers.

All the cooling measures have killed the market.

The only sizabledemand left now is the HdB upgraders demand and the real demand from people who are buying their first home.  Otherwise the driving force which originally moved the market to where it is today is no longer there.
 

Try paying 10% stamp duty

Try downpayment 50%

Try stamp duty 16% if you sell

Try not taking on more loan than 60% of mthly income.

URA releases flash 3rd Quarter 2013 private residential property price index 
Published Date: 01 Oct 2013 The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) released the flash estimate of the price index for private residential property for 3rd Quarter 2013 today.
 

Overall, the private residential property index rose 0.8 points from 215.4 points in 2nd Quarter 2013 to 216.2 points in 3rd Quarter 2013. This represents a moderate increase of 0.4%, compared to the 1.0% increase in the previous quarter (see Annex A).
 

Prices of non-landed private residential properties in both Core Central Region and Rest of Central Region declined in 3rd Quarter 2013. In Core Central Region, prices fell 0.5%, more than the 0.2% decline in the previous quarter. Prices in Rest of Central Region decreased for the first time since 1st Quarter 2012, by 1.1%, compared with the 0.2% increase in the previous quarter. In Outside Central Region, prices increased by 2.1% in 3rd Quarter 2013, which is lower than the 3.8% increase in the previous quarter (see Annex B).
 

The flash estimates are compiled based on transaction prices given in caveats lodged during the first ten weeks of the quarter supplemented by survey data on new units sold by developers in the first two months of the quarter. The statistics will be updated 4 weeks later when URA releases the full real estate statistics for 3rd Quarter 2013, which captures more data on the caveats lodged and the take-up of new projects. Past data have shown that the difference between the quarterly price changes indicated by the flash estimate and the actual price changes could be significant when the change is small. The public is advised to interpret the flash estimates with caution.

Overwhelming response from buyers at Sky Vue launch
 


The 99-year leasehold Sky Vue condominium in Bishan Central has attracted strong interest from buyers since its launch on Saturday. 

So far, more than 410 of the 505 units released for sale at the 694-unit project have been sold, at an average price of S$1,500 psf.
 

Its developer CapitaLand said that the one- and two-bedroom units were the most popular among buyers.
 

"We are encouraged by the strong support from our home buyers and investors who share our vision of Sky Vue as a chic contemporary home for urbanites in one of the most desired city-fringe locations in Singapore," said Wong Heang Fine, CEO (Residential) of CapitaLand Singapore.
 

"Most of our buyers are young couples who appreciate the well-articulated layouts and lifestyle amenities of Sky Vue and its proximity to the Bishan MRT station and Junction 8 shopping mall," he added.
 

The average price of a one-bedroom unit is S$750,000 while that of a two-bedroom unit is S$933,000.
 

The average price of a two-bedroom suite is S$1.15 million and the average price of a three-bedroom unit is S$1.58 million.

if an investment/trade causes u to lose sleep or get mood swings, then suggest to stop altogether for awhile coz thats unhealthy.
 

nowadays i dont lose sleep coz my short term trades have tight stops n loss amts that dont leave me having sleepless nights.
 

likewise my stocks r long core which happy to hold.

Overwhelming response from buyers at Sky Vue launch
 

The 99-year leasehold Sky Vue condominium in Bishan Central has attracted strong interest from buyers since its launch on Saturday.
 

So far, more than 410 of the 505 units released for sale at the 694-unit project have been sold, at an average price of S$1,500 psf.
 

Its developer CapitaLand said that the one- and two-bedroom units were the most popular among buyers.
 

"We are encouraged by the strong support from our home buyers and investors who share our vision of Sky Vue as a chic contemporary home for urbanites in one of the most desired city-fringe locations in Singapore," said Wong Heang Fine, CEO (Residential) of CapitaLand Singapore.
 

"Most of our buyers are young couples who appreciate the well-articulated layouts and lifestyle amenities of Sky Vue and its proximity to the Bishan MRT station and Junction 8 shopping mall," he added.
 

The average price of a one-bedroom unit is S$750,000 while that of a two-bedroom unit is S$933,000.
 

The average price of a two-bedroom suite is S$1.15 million and the average price of a three-bedroom unit is S$1.58 million.



 
 

One of the reason why it is selling well cause of the price.. The developer had shrunk the unti size from a typical size to smaller units.. If you love to stay in a "Hobbit" house.. it is a good place for u.. .. Just check out the size for 1 and 2 bedroom. It is SMALLER than our typial SHOEBOX units... Crazy

Capitaland ex-CEO said shoebox units "almost inhuman"  ... 500sqft is the minimum and yet what is Sky Vue small units size?

While CapitaLand’s ex-CEO had famously called shoebox units “almost inhuman”, new management seems to have reversed course, with the smallest units at Sky Vue now breaking below the 500 square feet “shoebox barrier”.

I think, very few can really load up.
 

All the cooling measures have killed the market.

The only sizabledemand left now is the HdB upgraders demand and the real demand from people who are buying their first home. Otherwise the driving force which originally moved the market to where it is today is no longer there.
 

Try paying 10% stamp duty

Try downpayment 50%

Try stamp duty 16% if you sell

Try not taking on more loan than 60% of mthly income.
 

Cannot lah, bro.... Most are Panting already.

Those who have bought properties in Iskandar or is planning to do so. Take note hoh
 

In a nutshell, to prevent foreigners from speculating on the properties, the Johor State Govtn is considering introducing some measures 
 

1) First property owned by foreigners must obtain permission from state govtn before being allowed to be put on sale.
 

2) Foreigners buying a resale property from a local must also obtain permission for the state govtn.

I say $70k only becos i have lost a lot much before.
 

Anyway $70k cant even buy COE nowadays so it really isnt big money.
 

I'm sure many here would agree.

If many here dont agree, then where is the market for properties to continue the climb?

$70k is but only 10% of $700k which is required as downpayment for a normal private apartment in current situation , isnt it?
 

So you guys tell me.....

No need black swan, already up lorry lah.
 

In fact its the opposite, we need a black swan event for the market to remain steady.

Everything simply points south, no question about it.
 

Its whether the "experts" dare to say it out loud or not.
 

Now they have with this still muted report.
 

The last paragraph, agent head still say , if drop 5 - 8% govt may remove CM....KNN they still dont get it.  

The Govt wants it to drop 10% at least from current.

That's assuming that this is a bubble. 
 

Firstly, there is a genuire demand for housing. 

In other countries such as EU , Japan and US, there is a indeed a property bubble because there is no significate growth in the population hence genuine demand for housing. Demand are mainly come from investment spur by imaginary demand. 

However,in sg and in chinese cities , there is a significate increase in the number of population yearly. There is a real demand for housing.
 

2ndly, there is significate inflation.

Some yrs back coffee is $0.50. now is .90 to $1.1 depending where you drink. There is significate inflation over the last 10 yrs that will sustain the price to normalised. 
 

Crash i think is unlikely. Correction yes

take eg. 1990 nikkei bull top crash which hasnt even recovered now. frm wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_asset_price_bubble
 

"Research has found out that the Japanese asset price was largely due to the lag in decision by BOJ to curb the issue much earlier. By end of August 1987, the BOJ has signalled a possible of tightening the monetary policy but decided to delay the decision in the view of economic uncertainty due to Black Monday (October 19, 1987)
 

Another alternative view of BOJ reluctance to tighten the monetary policy was due to uncertainty in Japanese economy, despite the economic went into expansion in the second half of 1987. Technically, the Japanese economy had just recovered from the brief (1985-1986)

Inflation aside. The demand for housing is increasing significately in sg.. cant say the same for japan.



 

ive a neutral reading on sg prop now. no idea where its going, i wont dare to say itll go up or down. all i know is that d recovery is short n sharp n our gdp growth rate has been falling every yr since 2009 whereas prop has been going up every yr. I dont like to see divergences in economic #s from asset prices. Either one is wrong.
 

I prefer to see gdp growth increase every yr n asset prices also, which was 2004-2007. Of cse 2008 it popped but at least back then it was more fundamentally driven, now its almost purely cheap debt driven, assuming linear pop growth rate. of cse last time pop growth rate was much higher n now slower. 
 

anyway since theres so much uncertainty, usually d mkt will go up, but dont hold me to it. regression to long term trend usually applies as does fibonacci #s.

I feel that gdp growth is not significate influence to the asset prices.. but the increase in population. 

In any case,  we will see..I am eagerly waiting for the Q3 ura report on the vacancy rate  on pte property. That will be a signifcation indicator on the real demand. 
 

What we now see is that government is loosing condition for home ownership in some sector.

Good question to the Pie.
 

In terms of "speculators" lets call them shorter term investors lah

The smart seasoned ones hv already cleared out.

Whats left are those who dont want to sell their extra properties (becos they got money, dont care)

And those who cant sell becos of CM and other impact which will translate to a loss. 

Who wants to lose money in Properties right?  Everyone is a winner in properties right?  

Thats what the agent always say right? 
 

But we all know, unlike the financial markets, properties dont hv instant liquidity.

By the time one is screwed and looking to sell, its too late.

i dont have a strategy i stick all d time, instead i remain invested no matter wat coz long term stocks n prop goes up.
 

wat i do most of d time is asset allocation, eg. assum i dont like to buy prop now, but i also know stock mkt can keep going up no matter wat i thk, so i remain invested to capture stock upside so that in case im wrong abt prop prices n they go up another 10% within few yrs, im still able to buy it later if need be. all d while i make sure got a ready cash reserve to buy anything if got black swan.
 

to me prop is commodity, so it can go up for longer than expected, n likewise down longer also.

Our prop market is highly controlled. Govt just need to turn on or off the tap for things to happen. I see govt trying to narrow the wealth gap as many Sporeans are already priced out of the market, struggling to afford their only home. What i don't see is govt trying to crash the market or even bring down the price significantly. 
 

My view is buying property for investment now is ok but don't expect high gains in the short term. Take it as a boring investment where nothing really can go too right or too wrong. I find some of the views here puzzling, treating property like buying penny stock. Anyway, with current cooling measures, u gotta be extremely loaded to even buy the 2nd prop. So if yr really loaded, don't know what to do with money and don't want to think too much, our stable prop market is always a good choice. If u find Bishan too ex, then maybe its time to look at Orchard. u be surprise at the narrowing psf. 
 

I always believe money should be invested. keep some, invest some, and there are many instruments to invest. do yr research. There are so many markets to invest.

take eg. 1990 nikkei bull top crash which hasnt even recovered now. frm wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_asset_price_bubble
 

"Research has found out that the Japanese asset price was largely due to the lag in decision by BOJ to curb the issue much earlier. By end of August 1987, the BOJ has signalled a possible of tightening the monetary policy but decided to delay the decision in the view of economic uncertainty due to Black Monday (October 19, 1987)
 

Another alternative view of BOJ reluctance to tighten the monetary policy was due to uncertainty in Japanese economy, despite the economic went into expansion in the second half of 1987. Technically, the Japanese economy had just recovered from the brief (1985-1986)

i dont have a strategy i stick all d time, instead i remain invested no matter wat coz long term stocks n prop goes up.
 

wat i do most of d time is asset allocation, eg. assum i dont like to buy prop now, but i also know stock mkt can keep going up no matter wat i thk, so i remain invested to capture stock upside so that in case im wrong abt prop prices n they go up another 10% within few yrs, im still able to buy it later if need be. all d while i make sure got a ready cash reserve to buy anything if got black swan.
 

to me prop is commodity, so it can go up for longer than expected, n likewise down longer also.




prop value go up is one thing. got buyer is another thing. 
 

so its the kind of investment where one should put a high dp. cos the sell off is tricky. many props in sg already stuck for months, some even years, can't sell. tats y bank is never in interested in prop, only money.
 

the city harvest loan is a classic eg. no bank want to loan them even their suntec shares are pledged as collateral. tats a super good deal. the lender really tan tio.

for sg, the crashes were triggered by external factors. but back then, no CM like today. today govt super careful and earn more commission from stamp duty. ppl tend to forget who the real property agent is, and best part, no need to even sell and take crap from customers.

Yr analogy is not accurate. Downpayment for first private property is at 20%, only 2nd and above is 50%. Buy hdb direct from from givernment, downpayment is also 20%, and no way to buy another hdb direct from government if already have first hdb..

Neither.  Right now I only left one investment property.  It is in the MB area and has been rented out for the past 4 years.  The rental demand here has always been high, because of all the international financial companies and high FT population.  Doesn't make a difference to me whether I sell or not, left a little bit of loan.  And I don't really need nor want the 911 that the profit will buy me.  Sell already also dunno what to buy.... so just leave it lah.
 
Buy?  Nothing to buy lah, property has already ceased to be a money making vehicle since a few years ago.  The multiple-fold profits we have experienced will never come back again, so don't even hope for a repeat performance.
 
To all the young people out there who were unlucky to have missed the big property price movement last 10 years, just concentrate on your careers and make your fortunes from there instead.  If you cannot afford private, buy HDB first.  Simple as that.

My friend.
 
To put simply, investing in properties involves money (holding power), stomach for risk taking as well as some acumen, with a bit of luck thrown in.
 
There were many of my peers these past 10 years who had lady luck staring them in the face many times but did not have the balls to go in and grab.
 
Every once in a while you could find some real gems in the market, either underpriced in a good location, or at an unglamourous location that later became more popular and prices went up.  It is whether you wanted to or not.

Ask Porker, Throttle2 etc other people who have experience in property investment.
 
Other than finding a good property, what about: the downpayment, the financing, the risk and the uncertainty of holding the properties?  Easy money?  You think at the time we bought the properties, we had a crystal ball that tells us how much we will eventually make, how much we should sell at, etc ?
 
No Sir, not easy money.  If you think it is easy money, you must have been listening to those con men who tell you that you can buy properties with no money down and make 1000% profit a few weeks later... bao jiak one....

Cannot lah, unless yours is way under $1mil per roof? 
Anyway, like you say, the boat has gone out to sea for properties.
People rushing in thinking they can make a bundle now are actually gonna face an uphill task of dipping prices and tougher financing.  Both of which are complete opposites of what we experienced 2004-2008 and 2010 to current.  
 
Most recently someone who wanted to sell his house at $4.2mil is saying $3.8mil confirm deal now.  Thats instantly 10% off asking price which is still too high looking at whats ahead.

As part of LTMP 2013, we will create more connections through the construction of two new rail lines and three new extensions. The rail network will be expanded every year from now till 2021, with more to come between 2020 and 2030. By 2030, the rail network will have doubled from the existing 178km to about 360km, and eight in 10 homes will be located within a 10-minute walk from a train station. In addition, buses will connect our commuters to even more places, with new bus routes added to our bus network. About 40 new bus services will have been introduced by the end of 2014, since the launch of the Bus Service Enhancement Programme in September 2012, and we will review what else can be done beyond that. - See more at: http://ride.asiaone.com/news/general/story/land-transport-masterplan-downtown-line-stage-1-open-dec-22?page=0%2C1#sthash.BX0i1ry9.dpuf

I agree. To the uninitiated, property investing seems like a walk in the park - just put cash there, close eyes, and presto!  you made money!
 
That is also the reason for the past few years, there were many suckers who kept buying those new OCR property launches at stupid prices.

I cant help but be worried for my children and their generation, really.
So i hope when we reach the bridge it will be there and not broken.....
Maybe i'm just pessimistic i dont know.
 
Good luck to all.

 
Teach your children about the value of money, how money works and how to make more to secure themselves a comfortable life is all I can say.  We live in Singapore and really, nothing else matters.  You are a banker and should have no problems with teaching that.  :D

Malaysian govt can suka suka come up with any law and regulation they feel like.
 
I think we all know that lah.
But many Singaporean people are very funny.... Their memories are very short....
 
 
People who work in finance will tell you coming up with full cash is pretty dumb.  Might as well pass the cash to them for them to manage and make more money for you.
 
 
I agree. To the uninitiated, property investing seems like a walk in the park - just put cash there, close eyes, and presto!  you made money!
 
That is also the reason for the past few years, there were many suckers who kept buying those new OCR property launches at stupid prices.

Choy choy dai ka lai see, i am not banker, only a wiper.    
I hate bankers.
 
Of course i will teach them value of money.
But how to make more i not qualified to teach.
 
We live in Singapore thats why other things must start to matter or we become zombies like all those bankers in Raffles place.

I've been trying to tell that to people for the longest time and I meant no disrespect to my friend Throttle for choosing otherwise.
 
Each individual has their own plan.
 
Why pay in full when my reserves can generate over and above the loan interest charged by banks

There are merits in either approach.
 
Staying vested means that there will be losses sustained when the global economy suddenly tanks. These losses can effectively wipe out any returns that one may have made in the good years.
 
Holding cash means there is gradual but unavoidable erosion of purchasing power due to inflation and the very nature of fiat currency.
 
The hybrid approach is probably what Throttle practises - staying vested in good times and liquidating most holdings into cash when the tides are changing. However this requires plenty of intuition, experience and being very disciplined.

Something like that but i actually do always stay invested all the time.
The only question is in what asset class and how much.
 
For example right now, i have only one property , the roof over my head.
Its fully paid becos i like to treat that as my stored value card.  So no matter what happens, i have a bit of money stored.  Then i have some in bonds , some in equities currently.  less then before though and the bulk in cash becos i dont like what i see right now.
 
Like you said, there are merits in both.
And being debt free is something which is as individual as ones choice in icecream flavor.
 
If you have some good ideas, do share with me.  
 
Cheers mate

A difference in opinion is no disrespect, dude. 
But You might hv misunderstood me.
I have never thought that paying in full is the best way, right way, only way
It just my personal most satisfying way.
 
Primary residence, i try to pay in full becos its a worry off my mind thereafter.
Investment propery, i dont pay in full for reasons we all know.
Watches and other items for general usage, i pay in full as a reminder that if it hurts paying in full, i probably shouldnt buy it.
Cars, i pay in full becos the loan rate is ridiculous.
I also do not buy any car which is past my psychological threshold ie $200k
 
At the end of the day, i'm just not as brave as some of you out here.
Borrow here borrow there, invest here, invest there.
I cant accept the risk being the sole breadwinner.
 
I hope with this, nobody misunderstands me yet again.
You are right, everyone has their own plan.
A prudent one , or a risky one, their choice.
Depending on the environment each one has its own pros and cons

Not quite right.Can afford but choose not to buy (psychological threshold)
thats why i buy cheap old cars.
 
Leave the new ones to the "real" rich.

Indeed, everyone has his or her own beliefs when it comes to investments.
 
Yours have served you well thus your faith in your own protocols.
 
Frankly, I share many of your viewpoints when it comes to investing. The middle path has been the most fruitful so far.
 
At this point, the property market is a definite no-no. The liquidity rush is coming to an end and we are likely seeing the last wave of buyers. Upside is essentially capped while downside risks are enormous. 
 
The imagery of lemmings comes to mind whenever I come across articles talking about sold-out projects even after the last few cooling measures. To me, the TDSR was the silver bullet, the stake in the heart and we should see the property market indices tapering off or even correcting in next quarter's update.
 
In any case, the adage "take care of the downside and the upside will take care of itself" makes most sense at this juncture.

So far two agents have come back to me reducing price by 10% from asking.
 
Automatically.
 
But they must be stupid to think buyers are stupid.  
Mark up at least 25% then discount 10%.

Developers gearing up for residential launches
Sales booking at Nine Residences in Yishun starts tomorrow
 
A STREAM of private residential projects is expected to make it to the market in the coming weeks with developers having little incentive to hold back launches.

 
First off is Nine Residences in Yishun, where sales booking begins tomorrow. In the Upper Changi area, Tripartite Developers will open the showflat from this weekend for The Inflora condo. Sales booking will start on Oct 25.
Sales are also scheduled to begin next month for Singapore Land's 40-storey condo Alex Residences near Redhill MRT Station; and Duo Residences, a 49-storey residential tower in the Bugis area with 660 apartments being developed by the Khazanah-Temasek joint venture M+S. Also expected to be launched next month is Chiu Teng group's five-storey freehold project in Toh Tuck Road named The Creek. The average price is likely to be around $1,600 psf.
 
In Yishun, Chip Eng Seng is expected to price the 99-year leasehold Nine Residences at about $1,070 per square foot on average. Absolute prices will start from around $600,000 for a one-bedder of 495 sq ft. Most of the three-bedders are priced below $1 million; these units range from 915-1,001 sq ft. The project's 186 residential units comprise one to five-bedroom apartments as well as six duplex strata units, each of which has a strata area of 1,905 sq ft inclusive of about 355 sq ft of void area due to a double-volume living room.
 
Nine Residences will be part of a 14-storey, mixed development with a strata retail component, Junction Nine, on the first two levels. The 146 strata retail units will be priced between $4,500 psf and $5,500 psf on the first level and $3,000-4,500 psf on the second level. Sizes will range from 118 sq ft to 10,527 sq ft for shop units, and 592-4,209 sq ft for F&B units. The 10,527 sq ft unit is approved for supermarket or shop use and the 4,209 sq ft unit, for foodcourt or restaurant use. Junction Nine and Nine Residences are located on Yishun Avenue 9, about 750 metres from Yishun MRT Station.
 
Over at Flora Drive in the Upper Changi area, Tripartite Developers will be rolling out The Inflora, the latest project in its alphabetically-named series in the vicinity. The 396-unit condo is being developed on a 99-year leasehold site about 1.2 km from the future Tampines East MRT Station, which is slated to open in 2017.
Prices start from $400,000-plus for a one-bedder. Hong Leong Group declined to provide an indication of the eight-storey development's average per square foot price.
"Similar to our other projects (in this vicinity), we believe that The Inflora will attract HDB upgraders and Gen Y home buyers with its competitive prices," said Betsy Chng, head of sales and marketing at Hong Leong Holdings, one of the three shareholders of Tripartite Developers. The other two are mainboard-listed City Developments and TID Pte Ltd. TID is a joint venture between Japanese developer Mitsui Fudosan and Hong Leong Holdings.
 
Some market watchers reckon the developers may price the project in the $800-plus psf range if they want to move units. "They can afford to do so, given the low historical cost for the site," said an analyst.
CBRE executive director (residential) Joseph Tan said developers are likely to launch projects as soon as possible. "There's not much incentive for them to hold back launches, as prices are unlikely to go up. They will either stay flat or go downwards due to lower sales volumes."
"Amid the caution arising from an affordability crunch caused by the Total Debt Servicing Ratio framework, buyers will selectively go for projects that are deemed to be reasonably or fairly priced," he added.

Low interest rate may persist for decades: PimcoPublished on Oct 05, 2013NEW YORK - Famed investor Bill Gross, manager of The Pimco Total Return Fund, said the global economy may be facing low policy rates for decades.Mr Gross wrote in his October investment outlook this week that investors should "bet against" expectations that the federal funds rate - the US Federal Reserve's benchmark short-term borrowing rate - will rise by one percentage point by late 2015."The US (and global economy) may have to get used to financially repressive - and therefore low policy rates - for decades to come," wrote Mr Gross, a co-founder and co-chief investment officer at Pimco, whose flagship Pimco Total Return Fund has roughly US$250 billion (S$312 billion) in assets."Right now, the market (and the Fed forecast) expects fed funds to be 1 per cent higher by late 2015 and 1 per cent higher still by December 2016. Bet against that," he wrote in the letter entitled "Survival of the Fittest?"His outlook on the level of rates is important because Pimco manages roughly US$1.97 trillion and is one of the world's largest bond managers.Mr Gross' and co-chief investment officer and chief executive Mohamed El-Erian's views on Fed actions and global credit also influence other investors because of the firm's size in the marketplace.The Fed has held its overnight funds rate between zero and 0.25 per cent since December 2008 and has more than tripled its balance sheet to around US$3.7 trillion, in an effort to pull the US economy out of recession and spur stronger economic growth.On Sept 18, the Fed reiterated that it would not start to raise interest rates at least until unemployment falls to 6.5 per cent, as long as inflation does not threaten to go above 2.5 per cent. The US jobless rate in August was 7.3 per cent.The Fed also surprised investors by keeping its US$85 billion in monthly purchases of Treasuries and agency mortgages unchanged, confounding many who had expected a reduction.Mr Gross's Pimco Total Return Fund gained 1.8 per cent in September, its best monthly performance since Jan 2012, according to data from Morningstar. That performance beat 98 per cent of peers, the investment research firm said.The fund is still down 1.97 per cent for the year, according to the Pimco website.REUTERS

Sometime i wonder why young couples are so happy that they "qualify" to buy an EC. Maybe i have small balls. But if my total household income is below 12k, i would think twice abt buying 1. 
 
Take home after cpf is 10k. Assuming they own a car plus running cost, easily 1500 a mth gone. Lets say add in the rest, income tax, 200, insurance 200, hp, 100, pub 200, cc 350, that add another 1150. 
 
All these are quite certain. Balance 7300 left before personal expenses, holidays, pet give birth, car water boil, .... Not forgetting that most EC is selling at least 650k a unit. Cpf might not be enough to cover all. 
 
I say at most balance only a few k left per month if they control their spendings. 
 
Maybe they have side lines to make money? Share lei.

174,000 millionaries only (3.2% nia) out of 5.4M population?
i think this is hugely understated leh ...
 
 

Jump in number of S'pore millionairesFigure now at 174,000, thanks to recovery of financial markets: ReportPublished on Oct 10, 2013By Yasmine YahyaTHE number of millionaires here has risen at a sharp rate, thanks to the robust recovery of financial markets in the past year.The Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report found that Singapore's total wealth grew by 8.7 per cent to US$1.1 trillion (S$1.37 trillion) in the 12 months to mid-2013. Average wealth per adult increased by 6.8 per cent to US$282,000. This figure includes a person's home, if he owns it.This is quite a turnaround from the last report, which showed that between mid-2011 and mid-2012, total household wealth in Singapore dipped by 2.5 per cent to US$1 trillion, while the average wealth of people fell by 4 per cent to US$258,117. As a result, Singapore is now ranked second in the Asia-Pacific region after Australia in terms of wealth per adult, up one spot from last year. Globally, Singapore is now in eighth position.Switzerland retained its top spot, with average wealth of US$513,000 per person, followed by Australia in second place with average wealth of US$403,000 and Norway in third at US$308,000.The report defines wealth as the value of financial assets plus real assets - mainly real estate - minus household debt.Towards the top of the wealth pyramid, the number of millionaires in Singapore reached 174,000 by the middle of this year, a rise of 11.5 per cent from last year. It is the highest number that Credit Suisse has recorded here since publishing the annual report in 2010, although the bank revised the way it recorded wealth two years ago.This number is forecast to further rise by 35 per cent in the next five years to 235,000 in 2018.This is part of an overall growth story that has been long in the making, said Credit Suisse's private banking and wealth management Asian economist Dennis Tan."Over the period of 2000 to 2013, with robust and stable economic growth, average household wealth per adult in Singapore has increased 150 per cent from US$112,800 to US$281,800, at an average growth rate of 7.3 per cent per annum," he said."Most of the rise is due to the high savings rate and asset price increases rather than exchange rate movements, although the latter provided a strong boost after the global financial crisis."Total household assets in Singapore in the middle of this year were divided evenly into financial assets and non-financial assets, reflecting the Government's strong encouragement for both savings and home ownership, he added.Despite the concerns that have been raised about rising household debt in Singapore, Mr Tan also noted that debt levels here are actually on a par with those seen in other developed markets."Although it has grown fairly quickly in recent years, the average debt of US$54,500 per adult is moderate for a high-wealth country, at just 16 per cent of total assets," he said.The distribution of wealth in Singapore shows a moderate level of inequality, Mr Tan added.About 80 per cent of the population have wealth above US$10,000 and 46 per cent have wealth above US$100,000, six times the global average.yasminey@sph.com.sg

Sometime i wonder why young couples are so happy that they "qualify" to buy an EC. Maybe i have small balls. But if my total household income is below 12k, i would think twice abt buying 1.
 
Take home after cpf is 10k. Assuming they own a car plus running cost, easily 1500 a mth gone. Lets say add in the rest, income tax, 200, insurance 200, hp, 100, pub 200, cc 350, that add another 1150.
 
All these are quite certain. Balance 7300 left before personal expenses, holidays, pet give birth, car water boil, .... Not forgetting that most EC is selling at least 650k a unit. Cpf might not be enough to cover all.
 
I say at most balance only a few k left per month if they control their spendings.
 
Maybe they have side lines to make money? Share lei.

 
so many elites in MCF
 
i wonder what lures them here
 
 

174,000 millionaries only (3.2% nia) out of 5.4M population?
i think this is hugely understated leh ...
 
 

 
if include home ownership,
 
i think 50% of HDB flat owners are millionaires

SINGAPORE: The Housing and Development Board (HDB) will build four new neighbourhood centres in Punggol, Hougang and Sembawang in five years to boost the supply of HDB shops.
It is also banning the assigning of its commercial and industrial tenancies to curb unhealthy speculation.
In a statement on Monday morning, HDB said it is building the neighbourhood centres and boosting the supply of shops to keep in step with the increased development of public housing.
The aim is to ensure that residents will have access to adequate facilities when they move into their new homes.
Besides shops, the four new neighbourhood centres will also include purpose-built public spaces to encourage community bonding.
HDB said it will announce details of the neighbourhood centres later.
Turning to tenancy of its commercial and industrial properties, HDB said it will disallow new tenants from 16 October 2013 to assign their tenancies.
That means that new tenants from 16 October will have to return the premises to HDB for re-tender if they wish to exit their businesses.
For existing tenancies, a three-year window period will be given to help the tenants make business adjustments.
From now till 15 October 2016, existing tenants can continue to assign their shops or industrial premises.
However, their assignees can no longer further assign the premises as they are considered new tenants.
To help shop tenants who wish to scale down their business operations, HDB will continue to allow shop tenants to sublet up to 50 per cent of their shop space. But only one sub-tenant is allowed.
So far, HDB has allowed its commercial and industrial tenants to assign their tenancies.
This policy was meant to facilitate the exit of marginal tenants and minimise disruption of services.
But in recent years, HDB said it has seen an upswing in average assignment fees and tendered rents.
Such increases would contribute to higher operating costs, which may be passed on to residents and consumers.
Assignment may also encourage unhealthy speculation.
HDB said its commercial and industrial properties are meant for tenants to operate businesses to serve the needs of HDB residents and consumers, and not to serve investments or speculative purposes.
To preserve the original intent, it is disallowing the assignment of commercial and industrial tenancies.

Last night i watched taiwanese news and talk regarding sg property bubble by the experts. Most of experts said that sg will get hit hard in fact one of the hardest when crisis occurs and they said that 2014-2015 could be a difficult year for sg especially with usa weakening.
 
For property, they said that the increasing supply will reduce the property price in 2014-2015 however the bubble wont burst. Just a correction and not property crashes. They said sg govt very good in planning including introducing the cm8 which curb further rising prices

	Singapore Shows Asia How To Crack Down on Housing Bubble
By Pooja Thakur - Oct 16, 2013 11:00 AM GMT+0800 


 
 

Singapore, the city-state that banned chewing gum to curb litter, is showing the rest of Asia how to cool a housing bubble.
The government this year ramped up efforts to bring down property prices that surged to a record, adopting some of its strictest measures, including a cap on debt at 60 percent of a borrower’s income, higher stamp duties on home purchases and an increase in real-estate taxes. The combination and timing of the curbs is the most comprehensive among governments battling housing bubbles, according to Vishnu Varathan, an economist at Mizuho Bank Ltd.

The curbs are proving more successful than in Hong Kong and China where policy makers have experimented with a variety of initiatives to temper soaring housing markets. Home prices in Singapore have gained 33 percent since 2009, while they have more than doubled in Hong Kong in the period.
“The government has enacted all these measures quite early,” Vikrant Pandey, a Singapore-based analyst at UOB Kay Hian Pte, the securities unit of Southeast Asia’s third-largest lender, United Overseas Bank Ltd. (UOB), said. “They want to contain a bubble from reaching levels where it brings down the whole system.”
Home prices in Singapore had the slowest growth in six quarters in the three months ended Sept. 30. Sales declined and mortgage growth fell to 13 percent in July from 18 percent two years ago.
The city-state, on an island off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, began introducing curbs four years ago after home prices climbed 25 percent in the two years to 2008. The government of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong intensified efforts as prices jumped a further 40 percent, driven by low interest rates, demand from local Singaporeans to upgrade from government to private housing, as well as buyers from China and Southeast Asia.	Tighter LendingThe gains led to Singapore being ranked the most-expensive city to buy a luxury home in Asia after Hong Kong by property broker Knight Frank LLP in a wealth report in March. Shanghai was ranked third and Beijing fourth in the report as of the fourth quarter of 2012.
The average price of a new 1,000-square-foot condominium is between S$1 million ($799,000) and S$1.2 million, according to London-based broker Savills Plc. (SVS) In Hong Kong, where prices have more than doubled since early 2009, the average for a similar size apartment is between HK$8.1 million ($1.04 million) and HK$12.8 million, according to Midland Holdings Ltd., the city’s biggest realtor.	Payments CappedIn Singapore, the government raised the minimum down-payment on second-home purchases, brought in new taxes for foreign and corporate buyers, and added a stamp duty for all residential properties. The Monetary Authority of Singapore said June 28 that home loans should not exceed a total debt-servicing ratio of 60 percent. In August, the central bank then cut the maximum period for new loans to buy public housing, where about 80 percent of Singaporeans live, by five years to 25 years. Mortgage payments were capped at 30 percent of gross monthly incomes, down from 35 percent, according to the Housing & Development Board.
“The loan measures are more lethal than the other measures,” said David Neubronner, national director of residential project sales in Singapore at broker Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL) “Home prices will remain flat for the next six to nine months.”
The restrictions are already deterring potential buyers such as Jeremy Ong, a Singaporean dentist, who was prepared to spend S$2 million to buy an apartment.
“The latest loan measures are tough and interest rates are going to go up,” said Ong, 32, who had been looking for a three-bedroom apartment near the upscale Orchard shopping district. “I planned to take a loan for 80 percent of the home value, but I’m not sure with the new rules how much I’ll get since I also have a car loan.”	Sales DropWhile an index of private-residential property prices rose to a record 216.2 points in the quarter ended Sept. 30, the 0.4 percent increase was the smallest since the first quarter of 2012, according to preliminary figures from the Urban Redevelopment Authority on Oct. 1.
Apartment prices fell 0.5 percent in prime districts in the third quarter, more than the 0.2 percent decline in the previous three months, the URA data on Oct. 1 showed.
The city’s private home sales slid 48 percent to 742 in August from a year earlier, the authority said in September. In July, sales fell to 482, the lowest in almost four years.	Developer ‘Headwinds’Neubronner estimates private new home sales this year could drop to 15,000 units from 22,197 units in 2012.
“This is what the regulator wants; the key objective is to moderate the loan growth and price correction with the measures put in place,” said Linda Lee, Singapore-based senior vice president of deposits and secured lending at DBS Group Holdings Ltd., Southeast Asia’s largest lender. “They also want the consumer to be more prudent when applying for loans so they can control the overall debt in the country.”
The slowdown is beginning to hurt developers. CapitaLand Ltd. (FSSTI) and City Developments (CIT) Ltd., Singapore’s two-biggest homebuilders, said in the past three months they expect “headwinds” in the city’s property market because of the latest measures.
Developers’ profit margins for recent residential project sales dropped to 11 percent from 22 percent six months earlier, Standard Chartered Plc analysts, led by Regina Lim, said in a note to clients on Sept. 18. Net profit margins could fall to less than 10 percent over the next 12 months, the report showed.
CapitaLand said in July it sold 139 residential units in the island-state in the three months ended June 30, 31 percent fewer than in the same period last year. City Developments said Aug. 6 it expects the volume of private residential sales to decline and prices to moderate in the mass market segment due to a tightening of bank borrowings.	Slower Growth“Sales of homes will be lower and the effects on mortgage lending in terms of slower loan growth will continue to be felt over the next few quarters,” said Ken Ang, an analyst at Phillip Securities Pte in Singapore.
Mortgage rates also are rising. Borrowing costs in Singapore, which doesn’t set interest rates to manage monetary policy, are driven by global rates, especially those in the U.S., where bond yields have been rising in the last year as economic growth picks up and the Federal Reserve considers tapering stimulus.
A “vast majority” of mortgage loans in Singapore have a floating rate, which means households will face higher monthly repayments when interest rates “normalize,” the MAS said in July, referring to expectations that rates will start rising.	Borrowers’ RisksMAS estimates that between 5 percent and 10 percent of borrowers could be over-leveraged on their property purchases with total debt service payments exceeding 60 percent of their income. A 3-percentage-point increase in mortgage rates would boost the proportion of borrowers at risk by as much as 15 percent, according to the MAS.
The average 25-to-30-year floating-mortgage rate has risen to 1.3 percent from about 0.9 percent a year ago, said Keff Hui, a director at Mortgage Supermart Pte, a Singapore-based mortgage brokerage.
That’s a risk Ong, the dentist, says he wants to avoid.
“I’m worried about servicing the loan as interest rates start rising,” he said. “I’m hoping that property prices will come down to more affordable levels.”	Home OwnershipUnder its first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, the city was transformed from a colonial backwater during its independence in 1965 into one of Asia’s most prosperous nations. One of Lee’s key policies was public housing, building modern apartments where 82 percent of Singaporeans now live, according to the Housing & Development Board’s website.
The home ownership rate for resident households was at 90.1 percent in 2012, up from 58.8 percent in 1980, according to government data. Lee stepped down as prime minister in 1990 and left the cabinet as minister mentor in 2011.
Singapore isn’t alone in struggling to come up with measures to stem property price gains, though the island-state that banned the sale of chewing gum in 1992, has proven more determined. The government in 2004 eased some of the ban on gum sales.	Hong KongHong Kong’s government, in February doubled the stamp duty on all properties above HK$2 million and raised the minimum mortgage down-payment requirements on all non-residential properties.
A shortage of supply -- from 2008 to 2012 Hong Kong developers completed the fewest number of units in any five-year period since the government began keeping records in 1985, while regular land sales were halted in 2004 -- ongoing demand from mainland Chinese, as well as less stringent mortgage rules than in Singapore, have seen prices steadily increase. They are up about 5 percent this year, according to an index compiled by Centaline Property Agency Ltd.
“Obviously, the tighter housing supply situation means Hong Kong has fewer tools to fight gains in home prices compared with Singapore,” said Hong Kong-based Buggle Lau, chief analyst at Midland Holdings Ltd. (1200)
The city’s curbs are starting to show some effects. There were about 11,000 home transactions in the third quarter, the lowest since the government’s Land Registry began making the data available in 1996. Residential prices will fall 15 percent to 20 percent in 2014 and are expected to decline 5 percent this year, according to UBS AG.	Chinese DemandDemand for homes in China remains unbowed even after the government in March stepped up a campaign targeting cities with excessive price gains and tightening home-purchase limits. Prices in September climbed the most this year from a year earlier, according to private data from SouFun Ltd., as the government has been less inclined to add to the measures and provincial cities, which rely on land sales for revenue, don’t have many incentives to implement them wholeheartedly.
While some may find Singapore’s property rules “draconian,” authorities should be pre-emptive and proactive, said Varathan at Mizuho Bank.
“It’s commendable,” Singapore-based Varathan said. “These are prudential measures to make sure that you don’t get an Asian version of the mortgage crisis in the U.S.”

New home sales jump 65% in September, strongest demand seen in city-fringe areas
 
Home buyers in Singapore picked up 1,246 private homes last month, as developers rolled out a range of new property launches.
This was a 64.8 per cent jump over August's 756 units, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed on Wednesday. Both figures exclude executive condominiums (ECs).
The top seller in September was Sky Vue in Bishan, where 433 units were sold at a median price of $1,401 per sq ft (psf), according to URA data.
This was followed by Thomson Three at Bright Hill Drive, where 264 units were sold at a median price of $1,362 psf.

I have a Mark XV military dial on bracelet, myself. Smaller watch compared to yours. It is one of my favourite watches.  I love its slimness, simplicity and unpretentiousness.  The non-coated domed crystal makes it awesome.

Cheap is relative.
 
In end 2008, $700 psf for lakeside is expensive
 
The agent is right in the sense in today's new launches, $1,000 psf is about as low as it will go, even in bukit panjang.
 
It's all about the absolute quantum now. Developers maintaining their PSF and downsizing 3 bedrooms to as small as <700 sqft
 
So it is really take it or leave it.. depending on your outlook of the market

TITLE: Couple suing condo developer for fraud gets counter-suedBy Claire Huang POSTED: 21 Oct 2013 17:41URL: http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/couple-suing-condo/855928.htmlA Singaporean couple suing a condominium developer for fraud over 20 square metres of space is being sued in turn. They claim the developer misled them into thinking they were buying an executive condominium unit with a floor area of 167 square metres at Blossom Residences.

SINGAPORE: A Singaporean couple suing a condominium developer for fraud over 20 square metres of space is being sued in turn.
Poh Her Chiew and Ling Mee Chow, both in their 40s, claim the developer misled them into thinking they were buying an executive condominium unit with a floor area of 167 square metres at Blossom Residences.
They said the actual area should be 147 square metres, as there is 20 square metres' worth of space rendered void.
The unit was priced at S$1.12 million.
Blossom Residences is a project that is still under construction by Grand Isle Holdings Pte Ltd.
Grand Isle Holdings is a subsidiary of City Developments Limited.
The couple's lawsuit states that the developer and its estate agent, ERA, had left out the fact about the void space in the sale brochure and documents bundled with the Option to Purchase (OTP).
It said the issue was only revealed several weeks later in the Sale & Purchase agreement.
The couple then chose not to exercise the OTP and sued the developer.
They wanted to seek repeal of the OTP and damages for wasted expenses and opportunity loss.
Their income has risen higher than the S$12,000 ceiling and this means they are ineligible to buy an alternative executive condominium unit.
While this lawsuit is to be heard in the High Court from Wednesday, the defendant is expected to bring a counterclaim against the buyers on the same day.
This is for under-declaring their monthly income by S$370.
The lawyer representing the developer is expected to ask the court to rule that the buyers forfeit the entire sum of Option Monies of more than S$56,000.
This includes the S$42,000 refunded to the buyers when they did not exercise the OTP.
The buyers are represented by Vijay Kumar Rai of Arbiters Inc Law Corporation, and the developer by Senior Counsel Ang Cheng Hock of Allen & Gledhill.

I looked at old resale in woodgrove.. location so ulu also asking $800 psf

i know of a research guy in one of the international property consultant firms who bought a unit in Jur East at $1,600 psf.
 
He is of the view it has potential to go beyond $2.000 psf
 
Although i do not share his optimism, this is evidence that it is not only agents who are bullish. At least this research analyst puts his money where his mouth is.

The MY developers might even huat wif the min $1M threshold for foreign purchasers. Something that was priced at, say, RM 800k could simply be 'sold' at RM 1M as it's still 'cheap' to many s'poreans. The marked up price could be in the form of loan rebates, stamp duty rebates, >10% p.a rental guarantees, reno packages, free maintenance for 5 yrs, etc, etc. Basically something that could outstretch the 5-yr RGPT. Sales could actually improve.

The reports always use no. of units sold. 
For eg. Last mth XXno. Of units sold versus a year ago XX no. of units sold.
Its so wrong to simply compare no. of units.
 
Nowadays most units sold are small compared to before.
Last time units sold average 1000 - 1200sf sizes, 
now probably per unit $700k - $800k or even less.
Totally different.
 
They should be using size area sold, or break down data to show.
 
That said, i read somewhere that despite all this so call buying frenzy, more than 3,000 units remain unsold throughout the island.
So someone must be lying, i wonder wonder wonder

Small quantum units are easier becos the audience is wider, just like everything else.
But due to the CMs, the ability to buy one after another has been capped.
Ownership regulations, credit regulations and duties.  
 
I believe just about every relatively big project is facing 10-20% unsold units and will take a longer time to clear stocks.  Inflora developers know, so they have to make prices look "cheap" to the current buyers push out as much as quickly.  Whatever is leftover may then take a while.
 
The cue in mass market prIces is from HdB.  Once that falls, the baseline is altered. Cant sell high, cant buy high either.  Of course risk appetite was the game changer but with TDSR in play, thats also in check.   
 
All the best.

http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/premium/top-stories/no-oversupply-property-market-consultant-20131028
 
 

SINGAPORE] Amid a sea of talk of a pending residential property market crash, one prominent consultant here has backed its resilience barring unforeseen systemic shocks.
Alan Cheong, head of research and consultancy at Savills Singapore, made his case last Friday at Carlton Hotel marking Singapore Management University's (SMU) homecoming celebrations for its Master of Science in Applied Finance programme.
"I think barring external shocks, property prices, residential prices will stay elevated," he said.
Mr Cheong argued that a fundamental concern that there will be an oversupply of homes come 2015 is not the case at all.

Once developers clear 60-70% stock, they are in the black already. Moreover, what used to take 3 years to sell in the past can be achieved within 6mths to a year now.
 
Hence less pressure for developers to lower prices beyond a cursory 5%
 
Mass mkt prices are tied to a certain extent to HDB prices. However, developers are reducing areas smaller and smaller to allow for PSF to continue on a marginal growth path.
 
I went to nine residences in yishun to kaypoh. Sales rate not very good. But I was surprised that all the 4 bedrooms were sold, and even 5 bedrooms were sold as well.. it was the smaller units that couldnt move.. occupier demand is still very strong it seemed.

Its not about covering cost, its about making a good profit.
The sales are moving becos developers hv reduced prices to move them.
Dont forget the penalty on developers on unsold inventory after TOP.
 
Whatever it is, there's no question that today prices are toppish and there is virtually zero upside in the near term.  
 
Next year on top of the high supply of new ones, there will also be the first wave of resale ones that dont face SSD anymore.  I am keeping my liquidity.

Yep, it's harder to make the good margins now. But it is compensated with increased volume. Even at today's subdued sales rate, it is still much higher than average volume between 2000 and 2009.
 
key forward indicator would be GLS price. At today's all time high price (and still pushing for even higher), it is hard to imagine prices being reduced by more than 5%. Architects just have to get more creative and build more 700 sqft 3 bedrooms.. removing kitchen, yard, etc 
 
waiting to see what happens next year too

I foresee supply and willingness to sell outstripping demand or shall i say the ability/willingness to buy over the next 2-3 yrs.  as the market trades on expectancy theory, prices today are reflecting tomorrows prices which are overall lower.

"as is, where is" clause, a contractual term most typically found in an option to purchase real property ("Option"). The effect of incorporating this clause into the Option is that the seller gives no warranty as to the fitness of the property for the purpose of the buyer.

ho say liao .... singaporeans will return to buy singapore property ... huat ah!
 
 

United Kingdom Finance Minister George Osborne could be set to introduce a capital gains tax on foreign owners of British property.
Media reports revealed Osborne could be set to impose the tax to curb speculation by foreign owners of property in the U.K.
Currently overseas owners are not subject to taxes on any capital gains they make from their British property investments.  British citizens must pay a capital gains tax – typically 28 percent – on any profit when they sell property that is not deemed to be their main residence.
Foreign buyers in London account for as much as 70 percent of off-plan new build property transactions, and in 2012 Singaporeans were the number one overseas buyers in this sector according to research from Knight Frank.
Stephanie McMahon, Head of Research for U.K. real estate agency Strutt & Parker, said: "There is no doubt that London has seen huge price growth, however it has to be acknowledged that this has been curbed by other government interventions through various tax measures including Stamp Duty Land Tax.
"Whilst it is clear that the government are proposing this new measure to take the heat out of London, one must ask whether the idea of the 'bubble' has been sensationalised. London, Greater London and the country as a whole have very specific dynamics and markets and one cannot talk so generally."
McMahon added that talk of the tax may see a flurry of activity in the short term, but it is likely that transaction levels will slow dramatically, as happened with previous government interventions.
Taxation of foreign buyers is not a new concept globally. New York increased its capital gains tax from 15 percent to 23.8 percent and saw a high increase in sales prior to the introduction of the new levy, while in Singapore foreign buyers must pay an additional 15 percent on top of the purchase price of their property.
There is no indication of the level of capital gains tax that the U.K. government intends to impose on overseas property buyers, or the timescale involved.

Sentosa cove cheap cheap
 
MCF elites...don't wait liao
 
 
 
Sentosa condo prices attractive: Colliers
Gap with 99-year mainland properties narrows in both prime, mass markets
 
A WINDOW of opportunity has opened for buyers in the Sentosa Cove condo market as prices in the upscale waterfront housing district are now attractive relative to both the high-end and mass markets on the mainland, Colliers International said in a White Paper issued yesterday.

 
The median price of 99-year Sentosa Cove condo units has dropped 44.2 per cent over two consecutive quarters, from $2,950 per square foot (psf) in Q1 2013 to $1,646 psf in Q3 - a pricing level that is about 1.5 per cent lower than their 99-year-leasehold counterparts in Districts 9, 10 and 11 as well as the financial district on the mainland.
 
"Considering that prices of condominiums in Sentosa Cove once climbed as high as 133.1 per cent above their mainland counterparts in Q1 2008, this about-turn today represents a possible window of opportunity for value investment and to snare a dream home," said Colliers.
 
Also, the $1,646 psf median price in Q3 is just 25.6 per cent more than the $1,311 psf median price of 99-year mass-market condos in Outside Central Region in the same period.
"This is in stark contrast to the 77.6 per cent difference registered when condo projects were first sold in Sentosa in Q4 2004, and the gaping 315.9 per cent difference in Q1 2008 when the property market was abuzz with strong interest from foreign home buyers. The current 25.6 per cent price gap is the narrowest observed since condos were launched in Sentosa," said Colliers.
 
In absolute price quantum too, there are attractive deals to be found on Sentosa Cove. Seven condo units with floor areas of between 1,012 square feet and 1,216 square feet were transacted at $1.71 million to $1.90 million in the first nine months of this year. Of these, six units were in The Berth by the Cove, which was completed about seven years ago, while another was a unit in the three-year-old The Oceanfront@Sentosa Cove.
"The entry-level price band of $1.7-2 million is comparable and in some instances, even more favourable than the prices of some popular new mass-market homes on the mainland. For example, two units of similar sizes in the yet-to-be-completed 99-year Centro Residences in Ang Mo Kio sold at a median price of $2.1 million in the first nine months of 2013."
 
"Given that new mass-market condos are increasingly pushing towards the $1.7-$2 million price band, potential home buyers with a budget of $1.7 million and above should not overlook the opportunities in Sentosa Cove, where the condo segment appears to offer intrinsic value in terms of capital appreciation in the long run," said Colliers.
The property consulting group said Sentosa Cove condos can be considered for rental returns as well. Condos offering unrivalled proximity to the sea will remain rare given the controlled supply.
"And with the unique island-resort lifestyle offering that is likely to continue to appeal to the affluent, there is potential for the net rental yields of 2.8 per cent as of September this year to return or even exceed the historical high of 5.4 per cent achieved in Q4 2008 in the long run, when the major economies emerge from their doldrums," according to the White Paper.
 
As at end-September, there were still 412 units which developers have yet to release for sale in projects that have only been partially launched. These are Marina Collection, Seascape, Seven Palms Sentosa Cove, The Residences at W Singapore Sentosa Cove and Turquoise. In addition, among the units already rolled out, 63 units remained unsold.
However, would-be buyers are better off seeking Sentosa Cove condo units in completed projects in the resale market, from investors who acquired their properties in earlier years, Colliers pointed out.
"Owners who have made handsome profits may be ready to cash out at a level that may be a bargain compared with the prevailing asking prices of new apartments being offered by developers," said Colliers' director, Chia Siew Chuin.
In fact, of the seven entry-level condo units that changed hands in the $1.7 million-$2 million price band in the first nine months, four in The Berth by the Cove and one in The Oceanfront@Sentosa Cove were sold by their first owners who bought them between 2004 and 2006.
 
Developers generally remain upbeat about the long-term prospects for residences on Sentosa Cove given their rarity value and are holding back on sales launches hoping for a recovery in the high-end sector. Most of them also have strong holding power and are unlikely to slash prices to clear unsold inventory.
IOI and Ho Bee have decided to rent out units in their recently completed 302-unit Cape Royale instead of selling them.
Demand for homes on Sentosa Cove has whittled on the back of an exodus of foreign buyers following the Global Crisis, as well as the onslaught of seven rounds of property cooling measures and the Total Debt Servicing Ratio framework introduced in late June.
 
In January-September 2013, only 29 caveats were lodged for condo purchases on Sentosa Cove, compared with 70 for the whole of last year. These figures pale in comparison with the the record 497 caveats in 2006.
Foreigners including Singapore permanent residents made up 17, or 58.6 per cent, of the 29 caveats for January-September 2013. In 2006, they lodged 188 caveats, translating to 37.8 per cent market share.

No, not for investment. For retirement. Basically the final house one will be in.
 
For myself, I hope that will be in Swiss, in the Alps. Cost of living is about the same as SGP, relatively safe as well, but much more clean air and space to live in.
 
Heard that as long one is above 55, anyone can apply for a PR in Swiss without much other conditions

Facing up to the impending property market correction
http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/facing-impending-property-market-correction
 
 
 

Owning a condominium — or, for the really ambitious, landed property — is many a Singaporean’s dream. But anything that is not an hour’s commute from the city centre can be eye-wateringly expensive and out of reach for most of my generation (those born in the 1980s). 

 
 

 
Owning a condominium — or, for the really ambitious, landed property — is many a Singaporean’s dream. But anything that is not an hour’s commute from the city centre can be eye-wateringly expensive and out of reach for most of my generation (those born in the 1980s).
Our predicament is not unique: Many citizens of major Tier 1 cities around the world experience the same challenges, and too many of them have also given up any hope of ever owning a house.
 
In cities like London, where the average flat is estimated to cost 7.9 times the average household income (according to Demographia), an entire generation of 20-somethings is growing up only to find that, even in their 30s, their savings are still not enough for a down-payment on their first home.
The situation is even more acute in cities like Sydney (8.3 times) and Vancouver (9.5 times) where, like in London, Hong Kong and Singapore, home prices have been bid up by inflows of foreign capital from investors seeking to park their wealth away from the relatively less stable regimes from which it was derived (such as the Middle East, China and Indonesia).
 
The result is almost always increasing discontent and disenfranchisement among the local population and, in particular, the emerging middle-class of young professionals. This is the group who have not had the time to accumulate any assets to benefit from rising asset prices, and yet must bear the costs associated with this form of inflation.
In Singapore, the problem is exacerbated by the pressures that our imported workforce exert — competition in the labour market depresses wage growth, while that same competition for scarce resources contributes to overall inflation for consumer goods, services and, yes, housing (although according to figures announced yesterday, this seems to have ameliorated — foreign buying in the private housing market fell from 17 per cent in 2011 to 7 per cent in the third quarter this year).
Overall, this leads us to the current situation, where real wage growth is outstripped by the pace of inflation, and thus, people find themselves in prolonged servitude to the owners of capital and other economic rentiers, widening the chasm between the haves and the have-nots.
 
WHAT GOES UP ...
The question that naturally comes to mind is one of sustainability. How long can an environment of such extreme disparity and disconnect last before capital flows reverse, and prices revert to reflect the fundamentals of domestic incomes and affordability?
The answer, if London and Sydney are anything to go by, is “very long, indeed” — but my suspicion is that Singapore’s market for private residential property is more likely than not to go through a period of significant correction in the next 12 to 18 months, along with much of the emerging markets.
Experts and industry leaders such as Robert Shiller (Nobel-winning economist) and Larry Fink (CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager) have expressed concerns about the “bubble-like” state of current global financial markets — bonds, equities and real estate — propped up by the unprecedented monetary expansion of global liquidity by major central banks, particularly the United States Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. Both Professor Shiller and Mr Fink have called on the Fed to begin tapering quantitative easing to take some froth out of the markets. Indeed, indications are that this may come as early as the first quarter of next year, thanks to stronger-than-expected US recovery.
 
While a tightening of monetary policy is overdue (and probably healthy) for the US economy, such action has dire implications for the emerging markets, including city states such as Singapore and Hong Kong, where asset bubbles have built up as an indirect consequence of exceptionally low US interest rates.
The withdrawal symptoms associated with weaning any economy off cheap credit are severe; asset prices could plunge to reflect the reduced willingness/ability for creditors to extend loans and for debtors to service them, and unemployment would likely spike as companies cut costs to preserve their profitability.
 
KICKING THE DEBT HABIT
 
As is the case with quitting any addiction, the initial stages are the most painful but also the most crucial, and the global credit binge since the onset of the 2008 financial crisis has created a population of “credit junkies” on an unprecedented scale.
In my opinion, the world needs another severe financial crisis, because we do not seem to have learnt a key lesson from the previous one — you do not solve a debt problem by creating even more debt.
 
Unfortunately, as figures from a recent report by Dutch bank ING show, total debt (that is, all forms of debt across both private and public sectors) relative to GDP has increased since 2011, having initially fallen from 2009. I guess old habits just die hard.
A handful of friends and family have accused me of being somewhat sadistic, wishing for a purgative recession of sorts. However, I would argue that our artificial sense of prosperity is due to central bank largesse, which masks the true cost of capital, distorts economic incentives and plays havoc with price signals generated by a market-based system.
 
Given access to artificially cheap money, inefficiencies are tolerated for longer and funds are diverted to unproductive rent-seeking activities, resulting in an economy driven by outsized, fundamentally unprofitable “zombie companies” and dominated by banking and property barons.
If recent data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority are anything to go by, recent measures (like the Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty, Total Debt Servicing Ratio and others) to cool the housing market may be working: Home prices rose at the slowest pace in six quarters. But unfortunately, prices are still rising.
It is my belief that, even if Singapore’s private property market does not undergo correction, as I expect it to, the Government should engineer one by continuing to tighten credit conditions and industry regulations. It is worth taking a little bit of pain now if it means preventing a far uglier property market collapse in the future and setting us on the path towards a more stable, sustainable economy over the longer term.

The construction companies cum property developers are in the best position to control construction costs. Hence they can afford to bid more aggressively.

IMF flags risk of significant decrease in real-estate prices
 

 


One of the risks the local financial sector could face is a significant fall in real-estate prices, said the IMF in its report on Singapore.
In the assessment, it noted that property prices are already past the 2008 peak and suggested that a 55 per cent fall in prices over three years is a risk.
 
While local property experts agreed that a correction is on the cards, they said a fall of that magnitude is highly unlikely.
Century 21 Singapore Chief Executive Ku Swee Yong said if prices started to fall very quickly, the Government would step in. “If there were two consecutive quarters of a 5 per cent drop, immediately, the alarm bells would start to ring.”
 
He noted that the Government had introduced initiatives to stabilise the property market and, if prices start to spiral downwards, some of the cooling measures brought in to curb price increases could be relaxed.
 
“Realistically, the only way prices could fall so fast is if there’s a global catastrophe.”
In a recent report, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research noted that a fall in prices is definitely coming, but not at the rate flagged by the IMF.
“We believe home prices are on the precipice of a 10 to 15 per cent correction over the next three years, with rising interest rates the tipping point.”
 
But Mr Colin Tan, Head of Research and Consultancy at Suntec Real Estate Consultants, said the IMF risk-assessment numbers cannot be totally written off. “Prices have doubled since 2007, but income has not. I think, based on that fundamental, property prices should be 40 to 50 per cent lower than what they are now.”
 
To lower the impact of any major property-price correction, the IMF made a few suggestions, including encouraging over-extended households to reduce their leverage.
In its response to the report, the MAS noted that some measures have already been implemented to encourage borrowers to exercise financial prudence.

Units that are being sold fairly easily now are those below $1m and small in size.
I liken that to the "retail" market.
Just as in a stock market, the last move is made by the "retail" segent who also is left with the brunt of the tumble.

although i agree that the rich shld settle themselves.. but hor.. some of the older folks that bought their pte pty 10-20 yrs ago are not exactly rich in current sense.
 
To downgrade is not really easy for some of them.
To sell and to move to hdb, they will still need cash.. some dont even have 1-3k.
 
Some of them are too old to get a loan also, so they may not be able to buy a resale hdb because no one would grant them bridging loan.
 
If they sell their current pte pty.. they will have to stay at void deck for a while before they are handover the cash proceed from their sale for their next purchase.. .
 
This is the group that gov may need to render some form of interim help.

yes.. if they dun have cash at all esp the sick old folks..
 
have you sell and buy before ?  you need to put downpayment / or rent apartment , pay for movers .. all these $$ , you need to have before completion of sales.
 
 
even if you buy resale 300k hdb.. you still need to put in $1k option..

ok. you talk until the person living in a million dollar private property don't have $1k in the bank.
this person should have sold the property long time ago.
similarly, a person who lost a job with no income and still want to drive a bmw 5-series (reluctant to sell) with no cash in the bank

Sell landed already, receive option money.
 
Use option money to purchase condo/HDB option.
 
Completion of landed sale will come in approx. 12 weeks.  So in 12 weeks time, collect full cash from buyer.
 
Upon completion of condo or HDB in 12 weeks (from time of purchase of condo/HDB), use the cash to pay off.
 
If option lapse and buyer of landed don't want to pick up?
 
Then the buyer of condo/HDB also let the option money lapse lor.  This option money surely less than the option money of the landed.
 
In the end, still got money to make.

Would u sell ur onli roof over ur head b4 buying a replacement roof? Likely not rite? 
 
So even if buy $300k hdb w/o loan, one still needs to cough up $300k cash b4 they can collect key to the hdb 3 mths later. And depends on how long to sell the pte, still gotta wait another 3 mths to receive proceeds. 
 
Not sure if banks would give a $300k bridging loan to a retiree w no income.
 
So may not be so simple hor.

the problem is sometimes.. these folks are so debt -riddance that no bank will help..
 
they own PUB , Singtel , IRAS etc... and with the compound interest.. no one knows what is left. The lucky or unlucky thing is that they dun own the bank that will force sell their property.. So they just squat in their landed lor.

I  already have offers from sellers of several relatively new different D9 condos in the range of $1700 to $1950.
Unit sizes are bwteen 1200psf to 1600psf.  
 
We all know that physical market doesnt move like and exchange because the liquidity is not there and instalmants dont run on daily basis.  But it wouldnt be long before, we see more decrease in prices.  I do beleive that people are getting a bit uncomfortable and i am not even talking about a rate hike.  Even if rates stay flat,  the property market is due for a good correction.
If the rates are hiked , the market will not only correct, it will tumble.
 
So i insist on not buying.

sometimes options cannot cover the debts also. you need to clear your debts with at least the government agencies before the completion..
 
Another thing is that hdb dun grant loan to these folks. So upon hdb completion .. they need all 300k in order to get the keys.. else also no go.. they wont have a place to stay in between..
 
So the biggest hundle for them is that 2-4 mth between houses.. they need to be able to put up somewhere.. and some have medical condition.

I am sure if you show HDB that the sale of your landed option is exercised, landed sold for $millions, HDB sure got no problem let you have early completion of purchase, move in and otang the full payment until completion of landed.
 
This is where the Govt needs to exercise some flexibility.
 
The buyer of HDB surely won't run away mah.  Plus got millions coming in liao.  No problem one lah!

I don't think there is a problem there.
 
The HDB is not inflexible, especially not when there is a HDB buyer that is confirmed worth $millions from his sale of asset.  HDB also has case-to-case basis and this surely falls under it.  If they want to be more stringent, check that the buyer is net positive and can afford to pay the HDB in full.

Another way is, after selling the landed, negotiate for extension of stay AFTER completion, during which the seller will pay monthly rental to the buyer. Until the seller manages to buy and move into his new flat.  This will solve the "roof over head" problem for a few months.
 
I don't think any buyer will reject this rental income!  Especially if it is an old landed but buyer receives market rate rental!

ha ha ha .. not so easy..
if sellers are "desperate" , it's unlikely that buyer will give extension esp when extension means that $$ already given to the buyer.
Lawyers is unlikely to agree to this also.. , HDB also wont allow.
This is because , after completion, if seller refused to move out/pay rent. there is no easy way to move them out of permises.
 
no buyer will want to be caught in a situation , driving old folks out their only dwelling.. :|

we are talking abt the situation where to seller has no $$ at all even 1-3k..and no one willing to lend then.  they need the house sale to completes before they have any cash.

Come on, its the same for everyone right?
Instead of being sitting duck, we do something, thats the difference.

Dont anyhow use, rich or poor and say i dont understand.
 
They already owe govt agencies, whether they die in their houses or whether they sell and move out.
That is the bottomline.  So better sell and repay and start afresh.
If they uneducated , then govt agencies should come in and sort it out. 
After all, thats what our tax is for right?

2day ah khaw say MND gonna announce 2013 masterplan soon... its been a long time since big plot ratio changes, so its quite expected to see upwards ratio revision in hdb old towns to accomadate 6.9M. To that extent, i suspect they will only increase HDB plot ratio whilst delaying increase private plot ratio to mute price speculations.
 
Commercial may see plot ratio increase n i expect new land to be zoned for medical usage.

hmm.. likely... but increase hdb plot ratio has no impact of the prices of the hdb as there is direct increase in value for exisitng hdb owners.. Just means that hdb estate will be more densely populated.
 
Hopefully the new ERL will be more clearly indicated in the masterplan.
Also the clear pic on the developement in th marine parade/east coast area. :) *vested*

This topic started only 20 Aug lah
We didnt predict a crash but there presents such a risk in the 12mth to 18mth horizon.
What we predict is a downward movement of prices across the general broad market and thats what happened.  We further predict prices to drop further.

I already have offers from sellers of several relatively new different D9 condos in the range of $1700 to $1950.
Unit sizes are bwteen 1200psf to 1600psf.
 
We all know that physical market doesnt move like and exchange because the liquidity is not there and instalmants dont run on daily basis. But it wouldnt be long before, we see more decrease in prices. I do beleive that people are getting a bit uncomfortable and i am not even talking about a rate hike. Even if rates stay flat, the property market is due for a good correction.
If the rates are hiked , the market will not only correct, it will tumble.
 
So i insist on not buying.

 
i cannot imagine how those people who stretch themselves to get a pte pty to be able to do refinancing with any bank 3 yrs from now with all the new loan curbs in place. if LL no refinance, then stick with old bank at their mercy 
 
last option, fire sale  [bounce2]

they wont stop printing, instead wat will cause a crash is the US economy slowing down into recession despite QE, n theres no further stimulus... thats when i thk its going 2 hell...

recent IMF speech by larry summers... of cse this isnt covered by mainstream news... its too worrisome lol

QE will b here for a long time, in fact maybe "forever". The best way to see things is assume real interest rates will always been zero, then new bubbles can then b measured, means wat was expensive last time, will get much more expensive than we thought, n then go even higher to a parabolic top then crash. The new normal, get used to it.

Maybe we should set up a poll.Car instalment as a percentage of monthly salary.
I recall last time, many in MCF say its about 30% of their salary and they are buying cars which are priced at 100% of their annual salary.  So $120kpa means buy $120k car.
So with the TDSR at 60% max , that means car instal and house instalment same same 30% + 30%?

anyway marina bay isnt news as the previous masterplan already zoned that area for use liao so it was matter of time they release for sale.
 
THis is why i refuse to buy any new projects like duo residence etc coz if i wanted a 99yr project, id go straight for the "best" which is marina bay seafront.

http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/breaking-news/singapore/singapores-paterson-hill-worlds-fifth-most-expensive-street-report-20131120
 

Singapore's Paterson Hill has been ranked the fifth most expensive street in the world with an average price of S$$53,800 per square metre by Billionaire.com. This works out to about S$4,998 per square foot. 
Paterson Hill is located in district 9, a tranquil residential area close to Orchard Road Shopping Belt as well as various international schools.
 
The most-expensive condominium on this road is The Marq, which achieved a record price of S$6,850 per square foot for a 3,003 square foot unit in November 2011. Prices along the street have jumped 6.5 per cent in the last year, though largely down to currency fluctuations, the report said.
 
Pollock's Path, The Peak, in Hong Kong was the world's most expensive street at US$120,000 (HK$930,670) per square metre, followed by Kensington Palace Gardens in London; Avenue Princesse Grace in Monaco; and Boulevard du Général de Gaulle in Cap Ferrat, France.

Singapore economy to grow by 3.5-4.0% in 2013: MTI
 


THE Singapore government now expects the economy to grow by 3.5-4per cent this year, hiking up its earlier official forecast of 2.5-3.5 per cent.
The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) announced on Thursday morning that Q3 gross domestic product grew a stronger 5.8 per cent, thanks to a rebound in manufacturing output.
 
This beat both the initial flash estimate of 5.1 per cent growth, and the market's expectation that this could be raised to 5.3 per cent.
 
This also means that after seasonal adjustments, and on an annualised basis, the Singapore economy grew 1.3 per cent, contrary to the flash estimate of a 1 per cent contraction.
 


that's why ... my fav tagline for 2013 is no $1M no talk

i refer to pareto principle eg. 80% of wealth is controlled by 20% of population. so for SG the poverty line is prob the median population coz our wealth gap is so big.

thanks..i still got many years to reach 66.. still got time...  
 
but from the report, the sg millionaire sounds like a very boring giam kana  
"So, that Ferrari which whizzed past you on Orchard Road was probably that of an Indonesian. 
 
And that high roller on the Baccarat table in the casino is probably a China “whale.” 
 
The average Singapore multimillionaire, in his pinstripe suit and horn-rimmed glasses, is at work on spreadsheets. He will then, most likely, go home to a quiet dinner with his wife and three kids."

Dow Closes Above 16000
 
huat ah !!! xmas lai liao.... i mean Yellen effect lai liao
whether the "fundamental" of economy is solid or not
cheap money is flooding into the market
easy come/up easy go/down ... caveat emptor
 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 16000 for the first time Thursday, extending a rally that has the blue chip-index on pace for its best year in a decade.
 
Thursday's gains came after Janet Yellen moved a step closer to becoming the next Federal Reserve leader and a better-than-expected report on the jobs market boosted sentiment. The Dow rose 109.17 points, or 0.69%, to close at 16009.99, its 40th record close this year.
 
The S&P 500 rose 14.48 points, or 0.81%, to close at 1795.85 and the Nasdaq Composite Index was up 47.88, or 1.22%, to close at 3969.15.

It is true that many rich new Singapore Citizens from mainland China are buying up landed properties in Singapore. MP Inderjit Singh commented one such case recently in the Parliament. In that case, the new citizen bought 3 landed properties in Kebun Baru

$250K passive income per annum. achievable?
if the target is only $125K per annum, then the total investment can be halfed
 
10% annualise return of $2.5M investment = $250K
8% annualise return of $3.125M investment = $250K
5% anualise return of $5M investment = $250K

Prices can only continue to go up if land supply is reduced. The authorities have already experimented with closing the tenders for sites at the same time but without much success in reining in response. Of course, one could argue that prices would have been higher if not for this.

 Spike in number of flats sold below valuation	THE number of Housing Board flats being sold below valuation has rocketed, as tighter mortgage rules eat into demand.
 

The Straits Times - December 2, 2013By: Rachel Au-Yong

THE number of Housing Board flats being sold below valuation has rocketed, as tighter mortgage rules eat into demand.
According to HDB's latest figures, 105 units were sold in October for less than their appraisal. This accounted for 7 per cent of the total resale volume, a marked increase on the average 0.3 per cent for each month of the first half of the year.
This means around four times as many flats were sold below valuation in October alone than over the whole of January to June, when there was an average of five such transactions every month.
This has forced sellers, such as assistant manager Raymond Koh, 37, to adjust expectations.
After asking for a cash-over- valuation (COV) of $20,000 for his $526,000 five-roomer in Punggol earlier this year and finding no buyers, he cut his price. "I lowered my COV to $10,000, then $5,000, then zero," he said. "Then I started going negative."
Today, his second-floor, nine-year-old flat is on sale for $20,000 below valuation.
The lower mortgage servicing ratio, shorter loan tenure and three-year wait before new permanent residents can buy public flats - announced in quick succession since August - have cooled interest. Median COV, the cash amount which buyers typically pay on top of valuation of a resale unit, fell from $35,000 in January to $12,000 in October.
Some sellers are no longer asking for COVs, and some are pricing flats even below valuation. OrangeTee research head Christine Li thinks the main COV killer is the stricter mortgage rules.
In August, the Housing Board announced that resale buyers can use up to only 30 per cent of their gross monthly income to repay loans with HDB, down from 35 per cent. This is in line with the mortgage servicing ratio announced in January for loans from private banks.
"Because buyers, especially young couples, can now take out only smaller loans, the additional portion has to be fronted by cash, which eats into their ability to pay COVs," she said.
Some flats will be hit worse than others, said analysts.
In Punggol and Sengkang, or larger estates in outlying areas such as Choa Chu Kang, the ramping up of new Build-To-Order flats has come at the same time as owners of neighbouring blocks being allowed to sell after a typical five-year minimum occupation period, said PropNex chief executive Mohamed Ismail.
"And if you live on the second floor, facing the rubbish chute - it's a triple whammy," he said. "Your COV will, of course, fall."
Owners such as divorcing couples or those who have purchased a new flat may have little choice but to sell.
Mr Koh has not bought a flat yet, but wants to upgrade to an executive apartment or a condominium in Sengkang, near the school of his choice for his five-year-old son. But he is adamant that $20,000 below valuation is as low as he is willing to go. "Any lower and I might as well continue living here."

Is this a plan from garmen to press down prices so that new citizens can buy cheap housing and to prevent old citizens from earning monies. Cos the only people that can profit is the garmen

falling COV or negative valuation is a function of oversupply under demand. this happened 10yrs ago when garmen did exactly wat they did recently by building ahead of demand. 15yrs ago they did so coz they expected rising demand n didnt foresee asian crisis, this time rd is coz of political pressure, so different catalysts but probably same results.... time will tell...

This time is different , is a engineered soft landing . GE is only 3 yrs away , hence price must be cheap cheap to allow more happy new citizen to buy wat , otherwise they get angry vote the wrong part how ?

The drop in hdb price have started.. and will continue until all EC / BTO are completed... :)
 
Alot of upgraders are being force sell their HDB because of the completing of EC..Due to this fact, there is more flats in the resale mkt forced to close asap, seller has no choice but to lower their expectation regardless of their holding power.
 
- PR cannot buy within the first few yrs
- Pte owner cannot buy
- PR buy already cannot rent out.. so no point for them to buy if they dun intent to stay in hdb.
- Profile of new PR are ppl with higher nett worth...
 
Now those youngster that KPKB abt hdb price too high for them. and concerned parents can take a break from kpkb liao :P .. ha ha ha

another point to add... hdb is losing it "investment" value to some hdb owners.
 
Simply because sg owners can no longer buyer a pte to move to, and rent out their hdb,  because of high downpayment and levy for the next house.
 
*well done* to hdb for curbing the speculation on hdb flats.

i thk they feel they can arrest the decline if it falls too hard by removing some cooling measures, but my experience is that once a commodity goes into bear mkt, it can remain in a certain direction for longer than expected. plus assume they remove cooling measures but interest rates rise, effectively theres no help liao... of cse hdb mortgage rates r set by themselves... but those refinance private properties may not b helped

yeah..i agree that they probably unwilling to that until all the singie get their house....
But if the owners kpkb more abt falling price, it is likely..
 
btw , billionaire cannot buy 1 block lah.. because 1 hdb for 1 family only..
 
aniway, alot of ppl i know is regretting buying oversea pte because of exchange rate hike( oz / my ) and the change in policies ( malaysia).
 
The spike in exchange rate effective zeroies the profit from these property...  Many ppl are still looking to buy in sg as part of long term planning... These ppl are not looking and 5-10 yrs turnover.. more like 10-20 years.

Drop in hdb price will affect pte price or not? 
 
Since more pr cannot buy hdb then assume these people buy pte or rent hdb/pte

Think pte will be pose for correction also.. because of higher vacancy rate..
 
however, since these owners mostly are not force selling.. , even if there is drop.. you dun see ppl selling alot lower than initially expected...  Also we need to see if there is any change in the immigration policies.
 
From what i understand, alot of  KL companies are looking into moving their manpower /hq here.. because of lower income tax.  My friend's company just got invaded by malaysians after the change in GM. Apparently, they get paid more here than in my and the company saves also because their personal tax here is lower. ( we are talking abt MNC paying global rate).
 
So i guess, a few landlords just got lucky also.

National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan said the tapering will be done in a "measured" way to allow the housing market to gradually adjust.

ENLARGECAPTION 
SINGAPORE:  The government will begin to taper off massive construction of public housing from 2014  as supply and demand for public housing return to balance.
 
In a blog post published on Monday evening, National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan said the last three years of sustained ramp-up have helped to "restore the balance in our housing market".
 
However, Mr Khaw said the tapering will be done in a "measured" way to allow the market to gradually adjust, just like the government had done to cool the property market earlier.
 
Mr Khaw noted in his blog that as the November's Build-to-Order (BTO) and Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) launch - the last exercise for the year, draws to a close on Monday, the average BTO application rate has fallen from a high of 5.3 in 2010, to a low of 2.9 this year.
 
The November exercise saw 8,952 flats in a single launch, making it the largest in HDB's history.
 
Mr Khaw said with this, HDB has delivered over 25,000 BTO flats this year and over 77,000 BTO flats in the last three years.
 
He said HDB has cleared the backlog of young families buying their first flats, with average BTO application rate for first-timers holding steady at below two times.
 
BTO application rate for second-timers has also fallen from a high of 25.9 times in November 2011, to 2.4 times in the current November exercise.
 
While singles' demand continues to be high, Mr Khaw noted that the BTO application rate for singles has come down from 57.5 times in July this year, to 25.2 times in the latest BTO exercise.
 
Lower application rates for November's BTO and SBF exercise
 
As of 5pm on Monday, the application rates for November exercise are relatively lower this time round.
 
For example, the number of applications for BTO flats in areas such as Sembawang is lower than the number of flats put up for sale.
 
There were 85 applicants for 174 five-room units in Sembawang. In Bukit Batok, there were 401 applicants for 591 four-room units in Bukit Batok.
 
Analysts said the results are not surprising.
 
Eugene Lim, key executive officer at ERA, said: "Due to the sheer number of flats that have been put on sale, this is possibly the biggest number of flats that have been put on sale in recent times."
 
Mr Lim also cited the wide variety of locations and the types of flats available as possible reasons for the lower demand.
 
According to analysts, home buyers are also lured by the lower cash premiums in the resale market.
 
"Cash premiums have come down, it is nice to see valuations, or sale prices equal to valuation or below valuation. This has attracted some buyers back to the resale market again," explained Chris Koh, director of property firm Chris International.
 
"Moving forward, I should see more demand now coming back to the resale market because prices of the resale flats have gone down."
 
According to figures from the Housing and Development Board, the average number of flats transacted below valuation was five per month in the first half of 2013. The number has increased to 105 in October 2013.
 
And while the government has launched 25,000 new flats this year, Mr Koh believes authorities are unlikely to commit to a figure next year, and will probably monitor and adjust BTO supply after every exercise.

Not no money buy BTO, is no money buy resale flat. Which makes all their "asset appreciation" talk look like a scam and makes a lot of people unhappy with them because they got problem selling their HDB on resale market.
 
Then hor, in the long run if valuations drop, HDB need to lower price of BTOs also (yeah right prices are delinked) because the surrounding resale values also drop. HDB earn less you say?? Cannot be!
So tarik back on new BTO lor. Politics mah, must throw scraps to the baying masses to keep them satisfied now and then. They cheong BTO launches to satisfy those who kpkb, now can forsee the current owners gonna kpkb soon (is it too late already?) so time to balance it up on this side.
 
They always like to earn money, but more important long run must ensure ruling party stay in power to keep their income opportunities flowing (and the dirt under the carpet) for the 6.9/8 million future.
 
 
ps, This is my simple layman coffeeshop opinion of the situation. Feel free to correct me.

don't even need to target bank clients.
 
Practically anyone on the street can own a iskandar condo.
 
The lowest entry i have seen just require $10k or so upfront and no other payment until TOP. And the $10k is for levy and other fees.

i don't think KT is an "average" earner leh ... where to find so much cash to buy and buy
all started from just one $320K property in 1986?
 
How an Average Earner Can Become a Multi-Millionaire Property Investor
 

Recently I had a reader of Propwise.sg write in to share her story of how she built up a multi-million dollar property portfolio in the span of over ten years, despite being just an average earner. I’d like to share her story, and have also added in some of my own remarks. I think it is a great illustration of how even an average employee, with some wisdom and of course a dash of luck, can build up significant wealth over a period of time. I’d like to thank the reader, let’s call her KT, for generously sharing her story.
 
Enter KT:
 
I stayed in a private property for 18 years before it went enbloc. I bought it during the recession of 1986 when prices were low and picked it up for around $320,000. The property was sold for $900,000 in 2005.
 
Mr. Propwise: A wise investor once said that you make money when you buy, not when you sell. KT picked up her property during a recession when prices were low. Of course this is easier said than done, as during the lows of the cycle you’d be worried about your job security and whether prices would fall further. But as long as you have holding power and have built up a cash cushion for the tough times, there is no better time to buy.
 
While staying in the private property, I decided that I had to invest in another property at the end of December 2002. The market then was extremely quiet and I remembered the URA price index was about 100. I saw a unit in Normanton Park which I liked so much because it offered a lovely view of the Kent Ridge forest. I bought it for $385,000 and the property has since been rented out for about $3,300 per month. The current market value of the property is about $1.4 million.
 
Mr. Propwise: The PPI at the end of 2002Q4 was 115.1 and had gone up to 215.4 by the end of 2013Q2, or an 87% increase. KT’s property, on the other hand, has gone up by more than 260% over the same period. So other than buying during the right time of the cycle, what you buy is also important. Based on her monthly rental, she is enjoying an incredible 10+% rental yield on cost and about 2.8% yield on current market value. By buying a good unit at a low point in the cycle, you maximize your probability of getting a good yield.
 
After the enbloc sale I decided to buy a landed property with the proceeds from the sale. I saw one in 2005 and bought an inter-terrace house with a land area of 1,800 sq ft and a built in of 2,500 sq ft for about $900,000. I am currently staying in it and the current market value is about $3,000,000.
 
Mr. Propwise: A few points about KT’s move to buy a landed property. First, she took her proceeds from a successful property purchase and rolled that into an even bigger property. It’s important to get on the right side of the property market cycle and make that first good investment. In the future you will then be able to build on that momentum and roll your success into even greater wealth. Second, she made the very smart move to switch from non-landed to landed during a period when landed property was relatively underpriced (a situation that has now mostly been corrected). This maximized her gain with a 233% return in just the past 9 years. Third, she got to stay in the landed property and continues to enjoy living in it to this day.
 
Then in January 2007, I was passing by West Coast Road when I noticed a huge crowd at a show flat at Clementiwoods. I saw a ground floor unit facing a park which I fell in love with. At that time, prices were still reasonable, and I bought a 1,421 square foot unit for $800,000. The unit has been rented out since getting its TOP three years ago at $5,000 and is currently worth about $1.7 million.
 
Mr. Propwise: To use the terminology from the Property Market Cycle Model I’ve developed, the best time to buy property is during the Late Bear and Early Bull phases of the cycle. If we look at when KT bought property, 2002Q4 was during the Late Bear phase while the whole of 2005 and 2007Q1 were still in the Early Bull phase of the cycle. Contrast that with the current situation when we are currently in the Late Bull phase of the cycle (as of 2013Q2), which has historically not been a good time to buy property as the cycle is turning. Also, KT is getting a great 7.5% yield on her property based on her purchase price versus the current 3.5% based on market value.
 
I am no expert but I invest only when everyone is not interested in property. I don’t look at property nowadays as I think the prices are crazy. The last three properties I acquired were done during periods when nobody was interested to look at the real estate market. I don’t earn a lot but through my property purchases I think I have made it. It shows that in Singapore if you are patient and dare to take calculated risks, you can make it and become a multi-millionaire!
 
Mr. Propwise: To quote Warren Buffett: “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” This is the essence of being a contrarian investor, and KT has clearly demonstrated this in her property purchases over the years. The key, as KT put it, is to take calculated risks at the right time. As for the current market, just ask yourself this simple question – are the participants in the property market today showing more fear or greed?
 
Though she was just an average earner, KT today owns three properties, two of which generate $8,300 in monthly rental income, plus the landed property which she enjoys staying in. Based on my calculations, over the years she has made over $4.5 million in capital gains from her properties. She can now look forward to a very comfortable retirement. Congratulations KT! And thanks very much for generously sharing your story so that others may learn from you

I recall in 1986, a five room HDB was about $125k and one could buy a brand new freehold terrace house for $400k..
 
So in 1986 can pay $320k to buy property means quite ok.
 
Pity the next generation.

i dont think so, mas rule is tighter than the Central Bank, so the portfolio they own is much more safe than the Lehman. I can imagine if SG banks went bankrupt, the majority of banks in Asia are following suit 
who thought it was possible for Lehman to turn turtle? 
 
Spore banks hold good portfolio, in bad times, good portfolio will also lose it value accordingly.
 
noob ques: how come Tem and gic lose so much good $? they are not gorven by MAS?

i think EC demand just got snuffed out by 1st 2 changes
 
 
 
Three tweaks to EC scheme


By
ong chor hao ongch@sph.com.sg


print |email this article

 
[sINGAPORE] The executive condominium (EC) scheme has been tweaked to bring the terms for ECs closer to that for public housing and to support a stable and sustainable EC market.

The Ministry of National Development said yesterday that there will be three changes following a review, which took into account feedback from the Our Singapore Conversation.
 
The first change involves the Mortgage Servicing Ratio (MSR) for EC housing loans from financial institutions for units bought directly from developers. The MSR, imposed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), will be capped at 30 per cent of gross monthly income and will apply to purchases where the option-to-purchase is granted today and hereafter.
Previously, the MSR did not apply to ECs. Analysts see this as an effective move to cool demand for this class of housing.
Ong Kah Seng, director at R'ST Research, said the implementation of a total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework shifted the demand for private housing towards ECs. This is because HDB monthly mortgage payments were not factored into TDSR calculations.
Mr Ong said: "This measure will ensure that buyers purchase ECs in accordance with their earning capacity and that developers cannot excessively raise prices since, going forward, the pool of eligible EC buyers might shrink."
Nicholas Mak of SLP International said that with the MSR cap, the quantum that homebuyers can pay - assuming an 80 per cent loan over 25 years taken out by a couple with $12,000 in combined monthly income - comes up to about $950,000.
The prices of popular four- and five-room EC units now start at $1 million, he said.
 
The second change is that second-timer applicants who buy EC units directly from developers must now pay a resale levy, just like second-timer applicants who buy Build-To-Order (BTO) flats. This is to "ensure greater parity", MND said.
This levy will range from $15,000 to $50,000, depending on the flat type of the first subsidised flat; if the first subsidised unit was an EC, the levy is $55,000.
 
The third and final change is the reduction in the cancellation fee for EC buyers from 20 per cent of the purchase price to 5 per cent, in line with the practice for BTO flats. This new cancellation fee took effect yesterday; it will apply to buyers of units in projects with land sales taking place from yesterday, including those where the tenders have not closed.
MND said that unlike private property buyers, EC buyers who cannot complete their purchase cannot sub-sell their units and have to pay a cancellation fee.
The previous cancellation fee, pegged at 20 per cent of the purchase price, imposed a significant financial burden on young couples who are unable to proceed with their marriage and hence, the EC purchase, MND said.

are they calling themselves the "new poor" (money no enough) so need govt subsidy?
 
EC deepen HDB deficit ... HDB is loosing millions-and-millions per year leh ... LMAO
 
ie: the market rate for a 90sqm PC is $1M and if EC is selling at $700K ... that's a $300K subsidy over market rate per unit !!!
as the saying from all property agents, EC = 30% cheaper than PC

guys got a question: this is frm HDB site:
 
"
Ownership in Private Property
You, your spouse, any occupiers listed in the Application Form or their spouses must not own or dispose or have an estate or interest in any other flat, house, building or land*
Within 30 months before the date of application, and
Between the application date and the date of taking possession of the EC"
 
does this mean i can buy EC if i still own a private property I bought >30mths ago? ok i just checked guess cannot since its same wording for HDB BTO as well lol

NO
 
That statement means you must dispose your private property and wait 30 months before applying for new EC or HDB flat from HDB.

Bro , buy EC got subsidise is talk cock one lah !  Where got saving 30% ? 1. You cannot rent out for 5yrs  2. can only sell after 10yrs 3. must sell away current HDB if you are staying in one.
For 1) you most likely lost out to PC by say 4K x 60mths or 240K . For 2 and 3 the lost is very uncertain , and investors hate uncertainty .
Beside the above points , you really think HDB lost money and EC is giving out subsidy ? Why not tell those EC developers to price at PC price and see got people prefer buy EC or PC .

1. that's why many die die (even money no enough) also try to get dual-key. live and rent out studio (1-room with bathroom and kitchen) 
2. can sell after 5 years to SC and PR only. ok la, since potential buyers are mainly SC and PR
3. yup ... but this one only impact those who can afford both hdb and ec (if possible). many upgraders probably sell the current hdb in order to "upgrade" with the fund from selling the current hdb

 				Don't understand, bought EC the first time, selling it at huge profit and buy cheaper EC the 2nd time. If you buy at the right time EC or PC is still the same, 2006 got no EC so no huge profit anyone buy PC in 2006 Huat Big Big why wait and buy EC 
				If you have SGD 100,000 and buy a PC in 2006 now you should have at least a 2 Bedroom PC and a 3 Bedroom PH PC UC in 2011.
 in the first place, for existing EC owners to sell EC, then buy another EC from developers... they have to wait for 30 months (same rule as ex-PC owners)http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10321p....ocument#Owners
 
Ex-owners of an EC:
Are you, your spouse or any of the essential occupiers listed in the application an ex-owner of an Executive Condominium bought directly from the developer? If yes, you would need to meet a 5-year period from the date of taking possession of the earlier Executive Condominium.
 
30-Month Period:
In addition, you need to wait out a 30-month period from the effective date of disposal (i.e., date of legal completion of the sale of their Executive Condominium, evidenced by the Notice of Transfer or such other documentary evidence as HDB may require) of the Executive Condominium before you can apply to buy another Executive Condominium directly from the developer.

With the resale price of BTO dropping, difficult to make a pile from BTO nowadays (or even in the near future)  
 
  
goodchong  Newbie  Join Date: Jul 2010 Posts: 28     Unlikely developer will lower the bidding price for the land. What they can do is				1. Reducing the unit size to make it more affordable				2. Reduce the cost , lesser or not too attractive facilities, minimal or no furnishing at the unit...				So what I can see is that the EC might get less attractive to own, and may have slower pace of appreciation in view of the facilities, cost and size. I expect OCR Pc will pick up soon.. 
now that govt is plugging the hole of EC ... EC buyers will stretch themself to PC buyers  ?

1st time buyer for EC will huat ah!
stay with parents while waiting for EC to be completed
no levy and hopefully EC price drop a fair bit 
let's see what is the price for 2014 launch EC 
btw, from CM1 to CM8 ... i have never see price drop leh ... it's either stabilize or creep up tiny bit
no drop or nose dive leh
this means CM is not to bring down the price ... it is merely stabilize it or prevent skyrocketing only
nose dive or crash = tan ku ku ... i'm talking about new launch not resale
 
some PC new launch you probably see price soften abit ... but if you compare size-vs-size and location-vs-location
the price did not went down ... just take Sky Vue vs Sky Habitat ... Sky Vue might be cheaper but the unit is also smaller
 
then you take Alex Residences vs Echelon ...

let's see what is the price for 2014 launch EC 
btw, from CM1 to CM8 ... i have never see price drop leh ... it's either stabilize or creep up tiny bit
no drop or nose dive leh
this means CM is not to bring down the price ... it is merely stabilize it or prevent skyrocketing only
nose dive or crash = tan ku ku ... i'm talking about new launch not resale
 
some PC new launch you probably see price soften abit ... but if you compare size-vs-size and location-vs-location
the price did not went down ... just take Sky Vue vs Sky Habitat ... Sky Vue might be cheaper but the unit is also smaller
 
then you take Alex Residences vs Echelon ...

I doubt Psf will reduce
I think size will reduce to make more affordable

Whoever buys now will be basically out of the market for quite a while.
Buy one, immediately write off min 20% for the first year. Where's the upside?
Therefore in the short term 1 - 5 yrs, buyers are running a much higher risk of illiquidity now more than ever.
Better make sure you can cover your debt payments, dont play play.

So dont play play hor.
 
Applies to all properties impacted by SSD, not only new launches

With interest rates still so low, why pay cash even if you have it on hand?
 
Even for CPF funds, I rather take a bank loan and keep the money for interest in my CPF for now.

huat ah!!!
 
Hundreds visited showflat of first 'retirement resort' here
 

Hundreds thronged the showflat of The Hillford, the first development here being sold as a "retirement resort" on Saturday.The project in Jalan Jurong Kechil, which has a leasehold of only 60 years compared with the usual 99, is also one of the first property launches for the new year. It will have a 24-hour concierge service, a full-time resort manager, and commercial units such as restaurants and clinics.
 
For ease of movement, corridors will be wider and each block will have two lifts. Toilets in the units will have emergency call buttons leading to the concierge.
The visitors to the showflat ranged from those in their 40s - mostly looking to buy and rent out - to those over 70 years old exploring the possibility of moving in.
 
"I'm here as I'm curious, the units are small and it's easier to tidy up," said a 70-year-old retiree who wanted to be known as Mdm Tan.
The development by World Class Land has 281 residential units. While the showflat opened yesterday units will start being sold only in about two weeks' time.
 
The indicative prices start from $388,000 for a 398 sq ft one-bedroom unit, $498,000 for a 506 sq ft two bedder, and $648,000 for a 657 sq ft two-bedroom dual key unit.

Bukit Timah address very yaya papaya meh?
 
Hillford's 60-year lease may pose financing hurdle
But project may be seen as affordable way to buy into Bukit Timah address
 
 


[sINGAPORE] While The Hillford could offer potential buyers a chance to buy into the highly desired Bukit Timah address cheaply, demand could be limited by its 60-year leasehold.
 
Marketed as the first retirement resort in Singapore - albeit with no age limit placed on potential buyers - the 281-unit project offers a mix of one-, two- and two-bedroom dual-key units which are equipped with built-in elder-friendly features.
 
Both young and old thronged the showflat when it opened on Saturday; according to a market watcher, of the more than 400 cheques that have since been collected, the majority were from younger investors
 
Key pull factors for the project include its attractive quantum and location.
Indicative prices for units start from $980 per square foot (psf), which translates into about $388,000 for a one-bedroom unit, $498,000 for a two-bedroom unit and $648,000 for a two-bedroom dual-key unit.
 
"It is like a legitimate shoebox development in a very attractive RCR (Rest of Central Region) location," said a market watcher.
Given that there are no restrictions on either ownership or tenant mix, it is not surprising that the project attracts younger investors, said Christine Li, head of research at OrangeTee.
 
"The indicative price is still on the high side, but given that there are fewer such small developments around the area, it probably will not deter people from buying," she said, noting that the latest launch in the area, Creek@Bukit, achieved a median price of $1,637 psf when it was launched last November.
 
Ms Li expects The Hillford to attract a mixed group of buyers spanning singles, downgraders in their 50s and 60s, and even investors who might have previously been priced out of the market because of the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) and other cooling measures.
 
But given the 60-year leasehold cap, investors might find it harder to finance the property since it may be harder to get bank loans for a shorter lease, said Nicholas Mak, head of research at SLP International.
 
Unloading the property in the resale market might prove a challenge, too. After five years, for instance (assuming the buyer holds the property for five years to avoid paying Seller's Stamp Duty), the development would have a remaining lease of 55 years. Based on the remaining tenure, a 30-year-old buyer can only withdraw up to 55 per cent of the value left in his or her Central Provident Fund. This assumes that the above sum is up to 55 per cent of the lower of the purchase price or the value of the property.
 
Another factor that could potentially limit the scope of buyers is the design of the project, said Desmond Sim, associate director at CBRE Research.
According to the developer World Class Land, the project was designed to be "significantly different" from that of a typical condominium, given its specially tailored facilities, elder- friendly features, and provision of services such as a 24-hour concierge service and dedicated Resort Manager.
 
"Is this the cheapest way to get a condo in the Bukit Timah area? Yes. But at the end of the day, it is marketed and designed for the elderly so you may not get the amenities and features of a lifestyle home," said Mr Sim.
 
Consultants agree that the project will likely do well, regardless of its buyer profile.
Indeed, more such sites could potentially be offered, said Donald Han, managing director at Chesterton Singapore.
"(The introduction of The Hillford) creates an interesting variety of products that is available on the market ... If we don't create such spaces, a lot of demand might filter into other countries," he said.
 
CBRE's Mr Sim agreed: "This is a pilot project. When it does well, it will spark off other projects. Maybe in the suburbs, where costs can be further managed ... I think if the government feels they have succeeded in reducing the cost of home ownership for the elderly, they may roll out one or two more sites in different locations."
But perhaps instead of the closed-envelope system currently employed, the government should consider a point system where every developer submits two prices - a land price and a product launch price, suggested SLP's Mr Mak.
 
"Higher land price, higher points; lower launch price, higher points," said Mr Mak. "In this way, they will be able to award the land to the most efficient developer."

4 reasons why 2014 could be a turbulent year for Singapore property
 
Reason 1: More new properties are going to flood the market
Reason 2: More resale units can be expected when the 4-year Seller's Stamp Duty duration expires
Reason 3: Owners who overstretched themselves financially will have a hard time securing refinancing
Reason 4: The pool of potential property buyers has shrunk significantly
 
look at the number of properties to be completed from 2014 to 2017 ... holy smoky ... where are the buyers?
 
2014 - 19302
2015 - 19727
2016 - 26469 ... election lai liao ... ho say bo

Pinnacle@Duxton ... last time one couple said $3,000,000 also no sell
 
in order for Pinnacle@Duxton to hit 7-figures means the unit must be valued at $900k + $100K COV
walao ... simi hdb is valued at $900k?
 

SINGAPORE- The seven blocks of the Pinnacle@Duxton on the edge of Chinatown rise an imposing 50 storeys towards the sky, giving their owners not just a great view of downtown Singapore but also the comfort that they are sitting on a potential gold mine.
 
Simply wait out the five-year minimum occupation period, which ends at the end of this year, after which those who want to cash in could easily demand more than $1 million for their units in the resale market.At least, that was the conventional wisdom until recent months, when resale flat prices kept dropping in a soft property market.Now, some residents in the Housing Board's (HDB) iconic blocks of flats, which are linked by skybridges, are tempering their expectations on how much profit they could make.
 
That seven-figure resale price could now be a skybridge too far.
 
A resident, who wanted to be known only as Mr Tan, said he was not hopeful of making a killing if he decides to sell his flat.Mr Tan, who is in his late 40s, bought his 1,130 sq ft five-room unit in 2005 for around $400,000.He said: "I may need to upgrade to a bigger flat as my two children get older. But the resale value might not be as good as previously estimated, so it may not be advisable to upgrade."
 
Last Thursday, estimates released by HDB indicated the resale price index continued to fall in the fourth quarter of last year, recording the sharpest drop in 8½ years.The resale price index declined 1.3 per cent as prices slipped for the second quarter in a row, reported The Straits Times.The fall was also the sharpest quarterly drop since 2005, when resale prices plunged 4.8 per cent in the second quarter.
 
Mr Tan said he had been optimistic the resale value would "be good, especially after I heard that a resident here had bought one of the balance five-room flats for $600,000 in 2008".
 
Furthermore, five-room flats in Bukit Merah had been sold at around $785,000, he added."But with the new (cooling) measures, it's not uncommon for sellers to reduce their asking cash over valuation (COV)," said Mr Tan, referring to the cash premium that buyers pay for resale flats.
STRICTER CONTROLSThe price decline in public housing is a result of stricter controls on home loans as well as the attractiveness and volume of new Build-To-Order offerings.New permanent residents also have to wait three years before they can buy a resale flat.
 
The New Paper spoke to 10 residents of the Pinnacle@Duxton, the first 50-storey project in Singapore.Comprising 1,848 units over seven blocks, it was launched in 2004 in a lacklustre property market.
Prices of four-room flats started at $289,200 and five-room flats were offered at up to $439,400.
Like Mr Tan, five residents said they were thinking of selling after they fulfil the minimum occupation period in December this year.While they can only wait and see now, property agents told TNP that the purchase restrictions have reduced the demand for resale flats and they expect prices to drop further.
 
In Punggol, for instance, the median resale price and COV of a five-room flat - at $560,000 and $30,000 respectively in the second quarter - fell in the third quarter to $542,000 and $8,000, reported The Straits Times in October last year.
 
A property agent, who declined to be named, said: "In the past, people were asking for $100,000 as COV if their flat was in a good location, but buyers now are even looking for zero COV flats - something that was unheard of years ago."
 
But PropNex Realty chief executive Mohamed Ismail said it was "still possible" for selected units at the Pinnacle@Duxton to fetch high prices in the resale market.
 
"People might still pay high COVs if the unit has unblocked views, for instance," he said.
While he doubts that any unit will hit the magic million-dollar mark, he said owners still stand to make "a huge profit, especially since many bought their units for below $500,000."
 
Agreeing, Mr Donald Han, managing director at Chesterton Singapore, said resale prices for the Pinnacle@Duxton "will hold" because it is a "hotly sought-after location and is unlike any other HDB estate".
But such forecasts are moot points for Pinnacle@Duxton resident Foo Soo Lim, 58, who bought his five-room unit on the 49th storey for $450,000 in 2004.
The businessman, who lives there with his wife, 53, their daughter, 12, and his mother-in-law, 88, said: "No matter what price is offered, I'll never sell my flat because I love the location. It's convenient because my place is right next to the Central Business District."

When it comes to things like this, a good businessman never says never.
 
I hv been to pinnacle once.  Parking is a mess and quality of the build is poor to average at best.
So the only thing is location.  I think for Singapore, i can easily accept a 15-20min drive distance from the city.  I do not want the action to be at my void deck.  Like as if life is not fast enough.

Knn, hilford at jl jurong kechil also considered bt.timah address??
 
Then i own freehold land beside Cluny Park last time considered what?
 
Singaporeans really like to slap face swollen to look fat, ah?

 
your land can consider as orchard rd lah

 
ha ha ha .. dun understand.
 
aniway.. the street name is not associate with bukit timah.. and it in d21.
it's remotely associated to upper bukit timah which is flooded with freehold.
 
i dun see how it's what address they are talking abt.. also no of the bukit timah good school is there..Morning jam like F*.. night also jam like F* .. sometimes.. jam until mid-night..

 
it's ok what.. u dunno retirees dont need to travel during rush hour?
 
all cramp up inside their retirement village 

 
 
ha ha ha .. the government has created an environment for themselve to let in FT..
 
- undersupply of able and qualified manpower in all sectors
- oversupply of housing.
 
hosei lah.. they now only got 2 options.. 1) ease the curb 2) open the gate and bring the ppl..

 
their intention was made very clear in the white paper already. Only thing hidden is the actual number they wanna let in. 6.9m probably just to test our reaction only.

Pinnacle@Duxton ... last time one couple said $3,000,000 also no sell
 
in order for Pinnacle@Duxton to hit 7-figures means the unit must be valued at $900k + $100K COV
walao ... simi hdb is valued at $900k?
 

 
If pinnacle only have 100 units then the 7 figure target could be possible
 
But with thousands all ending MOP at the same time.. i'd say good luck with that

or 9.6M ?

How come still talking about property? So Singaporean lah...
 
If you bought already or currently already own property, just keep under pillow and move on with your life lah.  No need to look at it till 5 years later.
 
If haven't bought yet or currently hunting to add to property collection/portfolio, also just move on with life lah, your jump building fire sale will never be here. If it ever comes, then you probably also won't want to buy because:
 
1. that will mean that the Singapore story/dream is kaput, over, finished, and not worth investing in any more
2. banks, if they are still around and not yet up lorry, also don't want to lend you because they rather invest themselves
3. not sure if you still have a job

my neighbour is trying to sell his flat. 2 months ago, his best offer was $20k COV. Under advice of his agent, he held out for $30K.
 
Today, hardly anyone is coming to view. The only offer he had was below valuation. Again, his agent attributed this to CNY and asked him to wait 2 more months and get a new valuation.
 
And this is in a mature estate with few flats for sale.. i think the situation is probably worse in new estates like punggol & seng kang where hundreds of flats are put up for sale at the same time once MOP ends

COV is a unique and crap. Do people overseas do this?
 
Seller: This much
 
Buyer: Ok
 
Who cares about what valuation the buyer can get from the banks? LOL

haha, yeah but his case also quite sorry. Have to downgrade.. hope he can at least get a fair price.. i suspect in a few months time, the agent will advice him to sell a much lower price
 
for condo, price drop will lag behind HDB, cos their demand comes from "upgraders" 
 
some people already anticipating by selling their flats now and renting for a year or two

i think the COV is meant to protect the market from escalating too fast... HDB  would have appreciated more if loan could be taken on the COV.

It is not really COV's fault. In fact, the system of COV whereby financing is not allowed helps to moderate the price escalation.
 
The real fault lies with the govt. If they have pegged new flats BTOs to resale valuation only, it would not have caused the rapid escalation.
 
They created the mess by taking into account the COV in their "delinking" process, thus pushing up the market.
 
Also, not to forget their idiotic policy to render supply zero for a few years while importing record number of immigrants.

bishan can still command the crazy price now because of its location and relatively little flats for sale there.

This is called: giving your kids a head start in life.  It starts from toddler class and nursery school.  The better ones are usually the more expensive ones that not many can afford.
 
In future, social mobility is going to get worse. If born poor, likely to stay poor for generations.

 	The Monetary Authority of Singapore says Singapore is not facing a credit bubble that puts the country or its banking system at any risk of crisis, in response to a Forbes article that claims Singapore is facing a dangerous credit bubble, fuelled by ultra-low interest rates.

ENLARGE
CAPTION 




SINGAPORE: The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on Tuesday said Singapore is not facing a credit bubble that puts the country or its banking system at any risk of crisis.
This was in response to media queries after a Forbes article claimed that Singapore is facing a dangerous credit bubble, fuelled by ultra-low interest rates.
The article cited several risks including Singapore's ratio of household debt to GDP, rising property prices and potential crisis in the banking system should non-performing loans increase when interest rates start to normalise.
The lengthy article dated January 13 was titled "Why Singapore's Economy Is Heading For An Iceland-Style Meltdown." It was written by a contributor who claims to be an economic analyst.
The MAS emphasised that serious observers and investors are not in doubt about Singapore's financial health.
On the unusually low global interest rates, the MAS said it is clear that they have stimulated credit growth and an increase in property prices in recent years.
However, decisive steps have been taken to cool property demand and prevent excessive leverage.
The central bank also highlighted three facts which it said 'stand out clearly'.
First, the property market is now stabilising and new housing loans have also been declining.
Private home prices in Singapore rose by one per cent in 2013, with a 0.8 per cent decline in the fourth quarter. This is after a three per cent price increase in 2012 and annual increases averaging 12 per cent per year during 2010-2011.
The MAS added that new housing loans fell by 35 per cent on year in Q3 2013.
Second, household balance sheets are on the whole strong and property asset values are significantly higher than the debts incurred.
The MAS explained that "the average loan-to-value ratio of outstanding housing loans stands at a healthy 47 per cent as of Q3 2013, implying a large buffer in asset values”.
Lastly, the MAS said Singapore's financial system is robust.
It cited a recent assessment program by the International Monetary Fund that showed Singapore's financial system would remain sound even under severe stress scenarios which include a sharp increase in interest rates - together - with a steep decline in property prices.
The MAS said Singapore's banks are resilient, with strong financial and capital positions.
The MAS said Singapore's triple-A rating from all the major rating agencies is not an aberration and that it attests to the country's economic and financial strength, including its sizeable foreign reserves.

Paya Lebar is the Next Big Thing?
 
Upper Paya Lebar Road condo site draws top bid of $392.3 million from UOL
 
$648psf for land alone ... selling price could be > $1200psf?
 

A 99-year leasehold site in Upper Paya Lebar Road drew seven bids in a closely-fought tender that closed on Tuesday.The top bid from UOL Overseas Investments - a unit of the UOL Group - came in at $392.3 million, or $648.30 per square foot (psf) per plot ratio (ppr).
 
This was just 3.2 per cent higher than the next highest bid of $378.3 million, or $625.20 psf ppr, by EL Development.
Consultants expected the site to garner a winning bid of $470 to $750 psf ppr, with five to 10 bids lodged, when it was put on the market on Nov 18.

marina bay suites bought by many rich foreign investors.
 
i wouldnt be surprised that they use it as holiday homes or just keep it as part of their waterfront portfolio without any need to rent it out for cash
 
more interesting would be suburban shoebox units mostly unoccupied!

Truth is that 1,300 psf is the price for almost all new projects
 
An agent friend told me the cheapest new condo in SG that is near MRT and shopping mall is at 1200 psf. He challenged me to go and find any project that is selling lower

Dunno about the unoccupied in the mass market.
 
Those Grange Rd, Paterson Rd, Cairnhill, Scotts, Ardmore, etc, those are unoccupied because the owners use them as holiday homes or just a place for their children and wives to stay in when they drop by Singapore for shopping trip.  Or just simply a brick and mortar where they dump their spare cash because they don't trust paper currency or paper titles.  These people have no need to rent out their units as rental income, actually it is more like they would prefer nobody else touches their apartment when they are not in town.  It is also highly possible that the units do not have bank loan on it.  I think your wealth management guys can tell you more about it.

I've always thought the "market subsidy" idea is stupid. 
 
To my mind HDB should always have been a "cost plus" policy, with the cost being construction cost (not land) and the "plus" being somewhat dependent on a combination of family size and income. 
 
With the market subsidy policy it was just a spiral with increases in one side, justifying increases in the other. 
 
I think there should also be even tighter controls on the sale / purchase of truely subsidised housing, coupled with more freedom for less subsidised housing. 
 

 
It is not really COV's fault. In fact, the system of COV whereby financing is not allowed helps to moderate the price escalation.
 
The real fault lies with the govt. If they have pegged new flats BTOs to resale valuation only, it would not have caused the rapid escalation.
 
They created the mess by taking into account the COV in their "delinking" process, thus pushing up the market.
 
Also, not to forget their idiotic policy to render supply zero for a few years while importing record number of immigrants.
haha
 
bishan can still command the crazy price now because of its location and relatively little flats for sale there.

wealthy indonesian, indian and prc buy with cash la
buy and let it empty ... no care of rental ... loose change nia 
 
buy and keep an empty unit in spore is better than keeping $cash in home country
if these projects were TOP recently means bought several years ago without heavy stamp duty, right
 
usa subprime ... build many many units ... many unsold and unoccupied
singapore property ... build many many units ... all sold and unoccupied
the major difference is sold and unsold ... unoccupied is no issue if "majority" buyers or owners have holding power
 
even the project is 20% unsold, the singapore property developer also can tahan right with their super-duper-awesome balance sheet
unlike the developers in usa subprime ...

Never dispute that fact, but no one wants to be the last man standing and a property somehow physically deteriorates when left empty.   There will be those who , as you have highlighted prefers it untouched, but there will also be those who are looking to rent.  Lots of empty well located units in the market will inevitably impact the rental of units in lesser places.  
 
As i said, there should be no debate on the direction of the market.
Only the magnitude and the velocity.

it is too unbearable for HDB to see new flat owners creaming off so much profits... their tolerance level is for new owners to "gain" $50K in paper. The rest have to go to the reserves to shore up investments abroad
 
that is why cost plus is not viable for now.. maybe when the market crashes..

I am surprised that even after living here for so long, you do not truly understand Singaporeans.
 
If you draw lines there to differentiate segments for the purpose of giving financial aid and providing free stuff, there will always be people who are going to game the system in order to qualify for that aid.  Through spreading of the word and tactics used, you will soon find entire groups of people gaming the system.

I dont think its a question of his understanding.
But its something he hopes.
Differentiation is not too difficult if we dare to put in place a clawback and big consequence if case is found to be gamed.
 
Eg. Home address is hdb but actually owns private properties and assets should not receive any aid.
And if people try to game it by using wife, relative etc names, then get ready to be penalised heavy heavy if discovered.

Its ok if they choose to stay in HDB as long as they are not subsidised simply base on their address.

Yes, you are right. 
 
mainly due to developers releasing fewer units.
 
The number of units sold has been so high that developers can tahan a 80% drop in sales for more than 6 months without breaking any sweat. Can buyers hold out that long? I dont think so.
 
Look at the paya lebar sale site - forward indicator that future launches will still hoover at $1,300 psf
 
Only thing the govt can do to really cool the market is to impose more buyer stamp duty plus reducing gearing , even for first timers
 
Or wait for financial Armageddon sometime after 2017

with hardly any major retrenchments, 0.25% will not do much. All can still afford the extra hundreds or a thousand. Just have to squeeze on luxury spending,
 
Have to push it to at least 3% to 3.5% then will maybe showhand
 
ABSD will work better in this current economic condition, IMO. if they impose another 5% more - especially for first timers, plus restrict loan to less than 40% LTV, i don't think there will be many who can buy a suburban $1.2m condo and fork out close to a million in cash & CPF.
 
Then that will truly chill the market for good!

Its not what the rate will be. But knowing that the govt is willing to raise it continuously .
Thats the law of expectancy, the market doesnt wait for things to happen before it reacts.
So start with raising 0.25% without much warning first, see the market freeze.
This i guarantee you.  
 
Take note raising rates dont just impact properties hor.
So 0.25 creates a rippling effect.

Its not what the rate will be. But knowing that the govt is willing to raise it continuously .
Thats the law of expectancy, the market doesnt wait for things to happen before it reacts.
So start with raising 0.25% without much warning first, see the market freeze.
This i guarantee you.
 
Take note raising rates dont just impact properties hor.
So 0.25 creates a rippling effect.

 
My friend said that with our small economy if we adopt a monetary policy that mainly depends on interest rates, there would need to be capital flow restrictions. I'm not an economics student, any thoughts about this?

TDSR framework is indeed a very good property cooling measures
sporeans are extremely cash rich  + foreign buyers love to buy spore property  = property cannot cool
 
those who bought property after TDSR in effect already based on 3.5%-4.5% interest rate calculation to determine their ability
if they still can pass TDSR means they are in very good shape!
 
3.5%-4.5% interest rate is peanut to them especially for property between $1-$1.5M which property analyst said these are the "affordable" mass market units
 
There are four major “killers” in the TDSR framework:1) 60% threshold
Total debt obligations cannot exceed 60% of total income.
 
2) 30% haircut
There is an arbitrary 30% cut of all variable and rental income, and 30% to 70% cut for the value of eligible financial assets.
 
3) 3.5% or 4.5% interest rate
Calculate new loan repayments based on medium-term interest rate of 3.5% for residential properties and 4.5% for non-residential properties, or prevailing interest rate, whichever is higher.
 
4) Income-weighted average age
If a borrower can’t meet the TSDR threshold, the guarantor will be the co-borrower.
Use income-weighted average age of borrowers rather than younger borrower’s age to determine loan tenure.

even if clients can pass TDSR, banks are taking an awfully long time to do their due diligence
 
no more in-principle loan approval in 10 mins

During times of relatively higher interest rates when compared to other countries, you might attract more hot money than you want (and vice versa: lower rates lead to hot money leaving) and to reduce hot money inflow is to lower rates but there may be a need to adopt a high interest rate regime to ward off inflation and this leads to complications.

yeah ... interest rates is very very complicated as you pointed out and also ripple effect as throttle pointed out
higher interest rate = higher business cost = people not buying property also suffer
 
property stamp duty and debt-servicing-ratio still the best way to mitigate over-leveraging ... no icelandic burst
need to plug the loopholes !!!

Raising rates does not constitute  the adoptiion of a monetary policy that mainly depends on rates.   
We dont mainly depend on interest rates, we just need to use it a bit more.

You dont need to be an ecomonist to realise who's more right or wrong when you know that every singaporean teenager yearns to retire at 30 by owning several condos - rented out
 
You dont need to be an economist to realise who's right or wrong when a B&B car costing a mere fraction anywhere else in this world is sold here for the price of a house in a neighboring country.
 
You dont need to be an economist to realise who's right or wrong when people buy luxury watches by taking "luxury" loans to look luxuriously luxurious to the neighbors cat/dog.  Noting that these same people cry father or mother when transport fares go up by an insignificant amount.

your friend is right. It is called impossible trinity in economy. Singapore has chosen a fixed exchange rate and free capital flow, therefore has no control on the interest rate.

I don't see anything wrong with that.  It is just a smaller scale of what listed companies who own shopping malls and office buildings and renting them out are doing.

You should know better than anyone else how frustrating it is to have traffic clogging up the road.  And we are really squeezed in this tiny city.  So the best solution is exactly what our Govt is doing - keep the bar high, highest bidders get to buy cars and drive.  Keep out those who fail to make the grade.  If you want it, I don't care how you do it, but you just come up with the money.  This is true meritocracy, fair and square!

That happens everywhere and is not unique to Singapore. And the material object in question may not be a watch, it may be many other things.  This is solely the failure of a person's character and education.  It has nothing to do with how a country is being run.  If one is "shoey (Cantonese)", one shouldn't blame the country and everything else around him.

I for one have said many times that we should not simply put the blame on the Govt.We should reflect on ourselves, understanding the situation before pointing the finger.
My above post as well is a reflection of ourselves. It is not blaming anyone.
 
But there is simply no question on the way Singapore (and many other countries) is (or has been?) run.
Its something which you may understand a little more when you have kids, Viceroy.
And if you already do have one, try having another, it deepens that understanding.
And if you indeed already have another and still dont get me, then wait a year or two, sometimes it takes a while.
 
And if you really really still cant understand, then you, my friend, is the true elitist.
Cos they dont understand it either, ever.

Hdb rental increase, demand for pte properties increase also so at least people will continue hold their pte properties
 
Why would HDB rent increase? 
 
Cap on foreigner means LESS demand doesn't it?  Less demand means rent down. 
 
Of course, private Condo demand will increase BUT...there is already a price gap between condo and HDB, so will rent increase? 
 
If people start to have problems renting HDB, then mortgage for the private condo becomes less affordable...
 
But apparently, island wide there is only about 1% of districts that will be affected by this - so at the end of the day it seems more like a precautionary measure than anything else. Would be surprised if there is any measurable impact on rentals at all beyond a few isolated sob stories

HDBs are scarcer now. No change to the same pool of tenants (even with caps, it's not like they slashed 92% of the quota). There is no cheaper substitute for HDB that this pool of tenants can switch too.
 
Condo is the next alternative. You think condo landlords will lower their rental to match that of HDB landlords? Condo landlords may have to lower that asking rents to tap some spillover demand from this pool if they are desperate but it be to that of a HDB rental.
 
If you are now one of the "8% approved" landlord, how much would charge compared to previously, now that you know only 8 out of 100 HDB can be sublet and your customers have no cheaper alternatives?

that's a valid argument
 
for now, the 8$ cap will lower rental supply hence maybe push up HDB rent a little
 
When more and more condo units and HDB flats are completed in the coming 1 or 2 years, and population growth is not as high, i think we will see more downward pressure on rents 
 
As it is, some condos i see are renting at close to HDB rents (eg $3000 for a suburban 3 bedroom vs $2000 for a HDB 5 room flat). Yields for condo at a very low 3% will fall further

Having said that, they do put their money where the mouth is. Most of the successful ones have been acquiring properties, Even at today's prices.

My guess there will be some adjustment downwards for condo rents in light of the physical completions in the next 2 years. (CDL appoint Goh Chok Tong type CEO to "look outwards" for growth is ominous). 
 
But rental and property price are very sentiment driven. It may take some time for rents to stabilize as the market works itself out but HDB rental should hold for now and rise later, if the 8% rule is not for show and enforced.

Definitely. Condosingapore forum has a lot of those types.
 
In the same breath, they can come up with:
 
Better buy now, next CM will make it harder to buy
Better sell now, next CM will make it harder to sell
 
Better buy now, project next door will launch at higher psf (never mind there are 8 other projects in the vicinity plus 3 more in the backburner = oversupply for the area ) and we may raise our psf or remove "pseudo-discounts"
Better sell now, so many projects coming up.

I dunno much about property - just going by what seems logical to me...
 
but a few comments...
 
1. $3k for Condo vs $2k for (similar size) HDB... some might call this "close" - but to me it's a 50% differential, which is pretty big.  My idea of close is within 15-20%. 
2. According to other articles, when you have a 5% vacancy rate, you get downward pressure on rents.  To me, this seems logical - at 5% vacancy its pretty easy to find an equally good unit nearby, so renters have a lot of bargaining power.  And also, think of it from a landlords point of view also - mathematically, the difference between $3k and $2900 is $2,400 over a two year contract - less than one month rent.  If I had a tenant willing to move in NOW, but was asking for a $100 discount, I'd be grabbing them vs having the unit empty for another month. 
3. I don't think you will see much upward pressure in the limited units.  Why?  Because each unit is assessed as at the time of renewal.  If the quota is reached - can only rent to locals - so no upward pressure.  If quota is not met....where is the pressure?

I dunno much about property - just going by what seems logical to me...
 
but a few comments...
 
1. $3k for Condo vs $2k for (similar size) HDB... some might call this "close" - but to me it's a 50% differential, which is pretty big.  My idea of close is within 15-20%. 
2. According to other articles, when you have a 5% vacancy rate, you get downward pressure on rents.  To me, this seems logical - at 5% vacancy its pretty easy to find an equally good unit nearby, so renters have a lot of bargaining power.  And also, think of it from a landlords point of view also - mathematically, the difference between $3k and $2900 is $2,400 over a two year contract - less than one month rent.  If I had a tenant willing to move in NOW, but was asking for a $100 discount, I'd be grabbing them vs having the unit empty for another month. 
3. I don't think you will see much upward pressure in the limited units.  Why?  Because each unit is assessed as at the time of renewal.  If the quota is reached - can only rent to locals - so no upward pressure.  If quota is not met....where is the pressure? 

 
1. It depends on sentiments, pendulum has probably swung towards the tenant. But can't assume every landlord is desperate to sublet.
 
2. We have been having 5% vacancy rate since 2010 so....
 
3. But you can still sublet rooms to foreigners. Just not the whole unit. Those who rent the whole unit (not included in the approved 8%) will go even deeper underground. That's why I say, depends on how it is enforced.
 
Although the HDB sublet rate to foreigners is 4% (officially), in some enclaves, it's higher than 4%, like 5%-18%. Meaning without cap, the equilibrium is 4%.
 
So if you are a HDB landlord in the right enclave (>8%) and you have the right tenant (ethnicity), you stand a good chance of getting better rents.
 
But to me, it is still business as usual for the HDB rental business as one room of tenants will just move out of a flat that used to be wholly sublet and find another room of tenants and rent 2 bedrooms from another flat in the same block/ neighbourhood.

Actually the Iceland article does has its merits.
Don't be too quick to dismiss it. 
Our property prices have risen too quickly.
To use an example that i experienced personally. .
Suburban units in the bedok area going for about 600k in 2007/2008, were going at 1.2m in early 2013.
The same bishan HDBs that today are selling for 900k and up, were selling at 550k then.
 
During this period, did population/rents/income double? 
What actually changed? Very little.
What was the driving factor during this time? Just global interest rates.
 
As Throttle rightly pointed out, interest rates have many effects, one of which is that loans become affordable.
This stimulates spending which drives the economy through higher employment, higher tax income, more infrastructure spending etc.
A virtuous cycle, driven also by higher money velocity and the multiplier effect. 
 
Once interest rates go up? the cycle reverses, and the multiplier effect also comes in play...And well, this is the painful part.
Its really like a balloon, first blowing into flat balloon a bit hard, then it becomes easier as it inflates.
We all know how balloons deflate.
 
My personal fear is that there might be a triple whammy.
Higher supply (which actually cannot be turned off), more CMs(van be turned off) and higher interest rates.
Even some of my rich China clients, one of whom who once bought 4 properties (not cheapo ones mind you, about 2-3m per unit)in cash (like throttle) in one weekend have all stopped buying.
 
Reason is that they feel prices are coming down. Wait and see.  They see properties here like any other investment.
If it drops, they will sell and cut loss. Imagine hundreds of other such people moving in concert.
Things like this could just be the pebble that results in a avalanche.

Rental rate is dependent on a number of factors other than availability of units.
 
1) Holding power of owners - they pay in full and they "buay song" give you $100 discount you LLPL because they can afford not to rent it out
 
2) Agents control - they group together and control rental rates of entire developments. "Market spoilers" will be viewed as such and they will be avoided by agents in future (co broking etc.)

i'm not saying that invisible hand can hold the market but i'm sure can "water down" the crash and slowdown the train to "soft landing"

KNN at 40 still dunno how to think, small wonder he's still an associate
10k watch for a 40 year old associate on 4o month instalment? A freaking mile stone indeed.

Why would HDB rent increase? 
 
Cap on foreigner means LESS demand doesn't it?  Less demand means rent down. 
 
Of course, private Condo demand will increase BUT...there is already a price gap between condo and HDB, so will rent increase? 
 
If people start to have problems renting HDB, then mortgage for the private condo becomes less affordable...
 
But apparently, island wide there is only about 1% of districts that will be affected by this - so at the end of the day it seems more like a precautionary measure than anything else. Would be surprised if there is any measurable impact on rentals at all beyond a few isolated sob stories

Simple demand supply law, supply reduce mean price increase.
 
Maybe we dont expect a high increase on price but probably demand for pte properties will increase

Agrees. 
 
Depends who is financing the cost - if the watch shop is bearing the cost, I rather ask for upfront discount.  BUT if it is something the bank is paying for, why not?

For a house, car maybe.
For a pure luxury item ?  This is prudent? Or simply spending money one does not have to keep up with the Joneses?
This is financial suicide as far as i am concerned.
 
For house, no choice.
For watches? A pure luxury good? Sheer stupidity. IMHO.
 
Time value of money is correct, but how much can you actually generate?
20k put in your bank account for the next 3 years can generate how much? 3% total or less? Hardly life changing money.

Theres something wrong, if u cant afford the 10k dont go for installment. What u adding is liabilities every months and during hard times, it will be even worse.
 
Even if u have the money, how much u can get from investing it? Cos once u forgot to pay installment the interest will kick in.
 
This is a pure luxury small item unlike house, car, yatch or even renovation that u can take loan as amount are too big to be fork out.

For a house, car maybe.
For a pure luxury item ?  This is prudent? Or simply spending money one does not have to keep up with the Joneses?
This is financial suicide as far as i am concerned.
 
For house, no choice.
For watches? A pure luxury good? Sheer stupidity. IMHO.
 
Time value of money is correct, but how much can you actually generate?
20k put in your bank account for the next 3 years can generate how much? 3% total or less? Hardly life changing money.

 
You've got two choices
a) Pay cash of $20k
b) Spread it over 40 months interest free.
 
Which is better for you?
 
Obviously b right?
 
It's not life changing money - but ultimately enough drops make an ocean...

Nope, i beg to differ.
Option A is better. 
And if i cant do option A, i cant afford it, period, dont buy.
40mths?? Thats too freaking troublesome.
 
Therefore, if only have drops, dont make ocean lah, just fill a mini crucible can already.
It's ok, no everyone can make an ocean, or even a lake, or a pond. Sometimes a puddle is fine.
No need to slap face swollen to look fat.
 
Can you imagine someone in a big Bentley asking his driver to let the car roll in neutral to save petrol?  If it's a Pplated cheryQQ driver doing that, can still understand.  Want to buy luxury? be luxurious lah....

Obviously? No, not so obvious to me. 
My option is A.
The pride and joy of ownership, knowing that i truly earned and own this watch, outright, right now, outweighs the measly 'returns'.
I deserve to take pride in what i have achieved, since i own and earned it.
 
Option b does not hold any pride or 'milestone' for me, as i have yet to earn and yet to own this 'milestone' outright.
If there's no pride, why buy this luxury item?
I am merely 'borrowing' it, merely pretending to have achieved. Empty pride. Yet to achieve. Who are you really kidding?
If so, it holds no value to me. No pride of ownership.
 
Well to each is own, and i realize you come from a different cultural background from most of us here.
So lets agree to disagree.

Obviously A, why? Cos this is a luxury item and if u cant afford it to pay cash, then dont buy. 
 
Unlike car, housing and reno, this is a need and luxury as well. 
 
If u have a drops of water, dont expect it can fill up a sea

I totally agree with you.. if someone needs to loan to buy a lolex. I think it's silly.. It's a shame.
 
hmm... but what if you have > 20k in the bank to pay for the watch..
how would you pay ? by instalment or by in 1 full payment ?  And the AD will still give you the max discount.
 
the only issue i see that with mthly instal, you may miscalculate your total liabilities, mthly commitments and also there are chance you miss payment because you forgotten.
 
 
anyway, if 20k is just loose change to you.. how you chose to pay for it ..really does not matter. Of course , i will chose the one with max benefit. to monitor deduction for 40 mths.. may be too much trouble in this case.

if i got 20k only and really really dying for a rolex maybe i will pay for full cash or by credit card at most 6 months installments(in case in need of $$$)
 
Even if AD give slightly more discount if take loan, if u miss ur payment the penalty will be much more than that

I think URA made a mistake in allowing for HUGE numbers of MMs to be built in Hillford because it is supposed to be retirement housing and yet did not set the requirement for age of buyers...
 
This is really stupid. If you want to artificially distort the market with measures like restrictions on MMs, you must APPLY it across the board. If it is meant for retirement homes, PLEASE sell it to old people..... how stupid can they be by allowing Hillford to built so many MMs and yet sell it to young people.
 
Anyway if you read the MAS article, they never said the housing bubble will not burst but rather that the financial system in Singapore can withstand the burst, ie the banks will not die. They never say anything about the pain on the borrowers. They say the loan to value ratio is like 50%, so the market can probably crash 50% and the banks can still get back their value....
 
Most of the article is focused on the health of the banks I guess.

parent will do anything for their children. by the time hillford is ready she is 78+?
since this is a private project, i guess there is no "subsidy" from govt
i assume there is nothing wrong about it since many old folk already doing it with their hdb
 
any unit between $500k-$600k, people will grab without 2nd thought
that's why all these property agents come out and say ... who care about retirement resort (many old people stay), who care about 60 years leasehold, as long as low quantum ... whack liao
 

 
 
 
good alternative for new minted PR since cannot buy resale hdb
but still need to wait for a few years leh ... why not buy ready < 10 years old condo - but price is indeed crazy

On the contrary, its not peasant bashing.
Got nothing to do with being rich or poor.
Everything to do with mindset and attitude.
 
If no money dont kehkiang take instalment to buy luxury
If work hard save up to acheive, then there is more honor and meaning compared to a rich kid taking his fathers money to buy a $300k watch. 
 
So its not peasnt bashing Enye, you need to get that right mate

upgrade to ec $800k+ aim for bigger unit and planning to sell $1.3M+ (5 years mop)
this plan take at least 13 years ... how to roll $300K to $1.3M ... huat ah!
 

I seriously think all these measures should have been implemented 2 years back. Singapore has became a country where her citizens become too obsessed with property investment as a form of living. 
 
We are becoming less "less" practical in how we make money.

Buy bto $300k take how much loan?Sell for $500k but need to pay how much outstanding loan?
Take remainder to Upgrade to EC and take how much additional loan?
Sell for $1.3mil and need to pay how much outstanding loan for the EC
Take remainder to buy private and take up how much loan?
 
In the end got how much loan ?

Rolling loan is ok as long as valuation up and up and up, income in and in and in.
 
When valuation down and income no in, rolling loan will be a rolling pin on your neck....muayhaha.
But of course, in Singapore , everyone is so rich, will never happen.

i got a better plan. 
 
Start with BTO, 5 years later sell, apply another BTO. Use profits buy Commercial/Industrial property. 
 
Another 5 years later, Keep BTO, sell commercial property and buy Condo. I rather skip the EC part cos HDB provides the safest investment and guaranteed rentals. 
 
Too bad i already pass that age. So young folks under 30, start with BTO unless u got loads of cash.

I am thinking about our singapore property problem.
 
I think almost EVERYONE feels that the prices is too high. The government found that out during the "singapore conversation".
 
The trick is of course how to bring the prices down.
 
One of the policy was to release much more land and BTO. I am wondering if that is actually beneficial. All the supply seems to get sucked up by the insatiable demand which means more and more singaporean money has become invested in property. Almost everyone I know has bought a property or two during the last 3 years. The problem is that those units do not get built instantly and comes on like 3 years later. 
 
When a downturn comes, it is really going to hurt because almost EVERYONE is vested.
 
I really hope the government is keeping those money they made from the land sales secure cuz we are probably going to need them when the down turn comes. I think the best solution out of this mess is for the government to make as much money as they can (by pricing the land as high as possible and keeping the developers margin low and through taxes like ABSD) and saving those money.
 
It make look bad to the man on the street but it is FAR FAR better than letting the profits go into the developers pocket....

Yes, but the reserves are not sitting idly somewhere and they are invested by temasek/GIC....
 
lets hope for all our sake, they are doing well...
 
I think they are heavily invested in Asia right? I hope they know when to get out or at least spread out the risks....

Very lucky indeed.
But careful, luck can run out 
Just like how it is going to be for many people in the next 5 yrs.
Therefore better have some skills to counter the bad luck.
Instead of hoping and hoping for good luck to continue.

i believe BTO made the most percentage gains. Folks bought punggol for 100+k selling for 500k. 
 
of cos EC will make money but having a flat just makes u a little special cos a group of ppl can't buy it n u will never starve of rental

you think developer will accept such loss to clear units?

That thinking is muddle headed. 
Where got "accept" or not accept losses? 
 
If a property is only "worth" $X, then that is its value - whether I want to accept it or not. 
Remember also that there are holding costs, as well as govt penalties for unsold units in a development. 
 
Think this way...
 
Lets say your cost is $1 million
Interest on the loan @ 2% is $20k per year. 
Got govt penalty of 8% per additional year if unsold.  This works out to $100k - 
Would you sell now for $920k or hold on for a year?  
 
And that's before things like cash flow and a dropping market come in...

Would be interesting to know how many unsold units there are across all the recent releases.  
BTO needs 80% before go ahead right?  That means that potentially there are 20% unsold...
 
That's a lot of units! 
 
Also, once fully build, the area is going to be horribly crowded...I hate to think what TPE is going to be like in 5 years

buyer B bought $850K-$900k close/after to TOP
can buyer A "sue" developer for undercutting price to clear unsold units? what's the law says?

simply put.. if current conditions remain the same... tight labour mkt, low interest rates, moderate economic growth etc.
 
prices psf will still remain no matter how long buyers try to hold out. That is because the developers are still setting the price. And they have no rush to offload (talking abt big developers)
 
Anyone hoping to see 15%, 20% or 40% discount will have to wait for a mini asia crisis.. possibly triggered from china.. as funds start to reverse back to the west, bank interest rates rise, and slowdown causing more retrenchments.
 
so look out for the signs and make the judgement call yourself

Sell for $500k but need to pay how much outstanding loan?
Take remainder to Upgrade to EC and take how much additional loan?
Sell for $1.3mil and need to pay how much outstanding loan for the EC
Take remainder to buy private and take up how much loan?
 
In the end got how much loan ?

upgrade to good district condo at 2.5m... sold at ??? (in future)
 
of course, all these happened during the 2004 to 2013 period.
 
According to my mother in law and my wife, they are very clever. Even though debts went up from 100K to now 1m (or more?), they have "made it" in life.. no matter how the mkt crash, they will still be in the money. both couple working, raking in nearly 20K a month (main income earner in high risk industry aka financial services)

Why so difficult to understand about developers keep outbid each other ?
There are at least 20-30 developers , gov release land for biding once in a blue moon , if the devoloper dont bid for that piece of land , no need to do business liao lor .
I think is more difficult to understand why people keep outbid each other for COEs at 3,000/= psf

you are right ... should not blame developer - their main objective is to make money ... lots of them
developer can bid $1000 or $2000psf for the land ...
if buyer still die die buy $2000+ psf for OCR ... there is no one else to blame but buyer
 
but there is a "trick" ... when 1 developer bidded a project in an area ...
the same developer will bid sky high for the plot of land next to it or nearby
bid sky high and sell sky high ... if any buyer want to buy a unit at that area ... no choice but to pay sky high because the whole area is monopolised by the "same" developer

i don;t think the govt is releasing land once in a blue moon.. LOL
 
if i am a developer who is expecting prices to soften 5% to 10%, why should i outbid by paying even higher prices and risk making zero margin or even losses?
 
i might as well dont bid anything and put my money into REITs.

That translate to a loss considering time value of money.

Remember there is a time limit to clear units before penalties kick in (which are 8% / 16% / 24% ) 
 
Interest is also a cost
 
There is also cash flow to consider

Remember there is a time limit to clear units before penalties kick in (which are 8% / 16% / 24% ) 
Interest is also a cost
There is also cash flow to consider
And in a falling market.... 

 
 
i agree with you. Whether or not developer can continue to hold will depend on the bigger pic. Their funds are not locked up in sg alone.

wife's good friend.. 
 
bought HDB at 300K. Sold at 500K
 
upgrade to condo at 1.1m. Sold at 1.6m
 
upgrade to good district condo at 2.5m... sold at ??? (in future)
 
of course, all these happened during the 2004 to 2013 period.
 
According to my mother in law and my wife, they are very clever. Even though debts went up from 100K to now 1m (or more?), they have "made it" in life.. no matter how the mkt crash, they will still be in the money. both couple working, raking in nearly 20K a month (main income earner in high risk industry aka financial services)
 
too difficult to explain to them, so i just go along and agree 
 
better to get something they can understand like residential, since 90% of people out there are experts with a view

 
Increase rate goes up then booooooooommmmmmzzzz
 
Over leveraged people will cry. Poor people like me just watch and pity them.

taking high debt.. wah. but still earning 20k  month. ok lar, if they still work for the rest of the yrs. without income to service loan.. tat's the worst part. i know many ppl taking huge debt n rely on their monthly income to service the loan, is pointless to be able to buy a million condo and not being financial freedom.

20k for 2 working adults actually not so ok lah. It is quite common. 20k per working adult then still not too bad lah.

That thinking is muddle headed. 
Where got "accept" or not accept losses? 
 
If a property is only "worth" $X, then that is its value - whether I want to accept it or not. 
Remember also that there are holding costs, as well as govt penalties for unsold units in a development. 
 
Think this way...
 
Lets say your cost is $1 million
Interest on the loan @ 2% is $20k per year. 
Got govt penalty of 8% per additional year if unsold.  This works out to $100k - 
Would you sell now for $920k or hold on for a year?  
 
And that's before things like cash flow and a dropping market come in...
 
 
 
 
Would be interesting to know how many unsold units there are across all the recent releases.  
BTO needs 80% before go ahead right?  That means that potentially there are 20% unsold...
 
That's a lot of units! 
 
Also, once fully build, the area is going to be horribly crowded...I hate to think what TPE is going to be like in 5 years

Thanks for reminding me,  I was about to post on the jam...  I notice the jam starts when I turn into slip road to the toward sle direction almost on every morning since beginning of the year,...  Same timing and routine,  around 7:35am.. It was never that bad last year...Slow speed,  start stop, all the way until sle..

buyer A bought $1M+ during launch
buyer B bought $850K-$900k close/after to TOP
can buyer A "sue" developer for undercutting price to clear unsold units? what's the law says?

If buyer B bought $1.1M... can developer ask buyer A to top up $100k?

Yeah, in SG, some developers are govt or kawan of govt...
if we storm their office.. they send us to Changi. 
 
...but we can sign price protection contract like.. within 2-3 years, if price drop >5%, developer will refund xx%.

actually my point is ... in the tv programme the "analyst" commented developer will not cut price drastically for existing project aka unsold units ... 
 
those bought already will suffer a great loss if the project value goes down. new project ... may be.

	The HDB resale market may have turned the corner, with a more neutral balance between sellers and buyers, but it has not reached its steady state yet, said National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan.

CAPTION 




















SINGAPORE: The HDB resale market may have turned the corner, with a more neutral balance between sellers and buyers, but it has not reached its steady state yet.


National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan made the remark in his blog on Saturday morning.


He was referring to the last quarter's resale data that the Housing and Development Board (HDB) released on Friday.


He noted that over the next three years, 80,000 new HDB flats will be rolled out, and 30,000 of them will be completed in this year alone -- more than doubling last year's figure.


Most buyers of these new flats will be first-timers.


"But some, not a small number, are flat owners who will need to dispose of their existing flats within six months after collecting keys to their new flats," Mr Khaw said.


Of the 18,100 HDB resale transactions, 2,800 units came from households in the process of moving to their new flats.


The authorities expect the number to double to about 6,000 units each year, in the coming three years.


The number does not include those selling their HDB flats to move into newly completed private property.


Mr Khaw said: "This will no doubt have an impact on the resale HDB market, starting from this year. We will be monitoring closely. I am sure flat hunters and sellers will too."


Data released by the HDB on Friday showed that prices of HDB resale flats registered a 0.6 per cent decline last year -- down from the 6.6 per cent price growth seen in 2012 and the double-digit growth in the two years before that.


As for the fourth quarter last year, prices fell 1.5 per cent, marking two consecutive quarters of price declines in 2013.

I glanced theough this report and it doesnt say anything about which company is really tops in real profits.
 
No. Of units sold is like the worst way to compare.
 
Say one developer sells 300 units of mickey mouse apartments vs one which sells 150 units of luxurious 1500 to 2000sft units.    Does no. Of units tell the real story?  Its no secret that developers HAD to cut unit sizes to bring down quantum as a way to boost sales.
 
Now they will absorb this and that etc...but still keep psf prices stagnant becos they are scared that once they cut psf$ upfront, it could lead to a complete market pullback.
You know lah, The market here is sibei herd type.

big brother selling emerging market currencies ... lai liao
don't play play
 
now sgd$1 = myr$2.6 ... myr$3 by 2015? 
hopefully, sgd$ will not be beaten up badly ....
 

Investors around the world braced for another rough and tumble trading session Monday amid growing volatility in emerging markets.
Asian markets opened sharply lower as benchmark indices in Tokyo and Hong Kong shed more than 2% as investors looked to move out of riskier assets. South Korea's KOSPI Index and the Mumbai Sensex were off by 1.5%.
In currency markets, the yen gained ground against the dollar as investors parked their money in traditional safe havens. Emerging market currencies extended losses, building on a trend from last week that hit the Argentinian peso, Turkey's lira and India's rupee especially hard.
Emerging markets have been hammered in recent days due to the possibility that the Federal Reserve, Bank of England and Bank of Japan will pull back on propping up their own economies. Signs of weakness in China's huge manufacturing sector and a looming default in the shadow banking system have only added to worries.
"The fear is that the Fed, Bank of England, and even the Band of Japan will become less dovish more quickly than had been though even a few weeks ago," said Steven Englander, head of foreign exchange strategy at CitiFX.

There were also dozens of such articles during 2008 crisis, saying until like dooms day coming. In the end, see how fast the market rebounded from 2010 till now. I will take such article as reading pleasure nia.

 
so what's your position?

 
ya when price crash, its time to max out mortgage, but frm my experience, its hard 2 get a bank 2 match asking price when its d bottom coz banks will b even more conservative than u when sh!t hits da fan!
 

 
probably can get 40% to 50% LTV for resale

speculators and overstrechers maybe yes
but as govt pointed out, 70-80% of buyers are upgraders who buy to live in ... so bo taichi one
unless many upgraders lost their job due to economy crisis ... that's a different story

wife's good friend.. 
 
bought HDB at 300K. Sold at 500K
 
upgrade to condo at 1.1m. Sold at 1.6m
 
upgrade to good district condo at 2.5m... sold at ??? (in future)
 
of course, all these happened during the 2004 to 2013 period.
 
According to my mother in law and my wife, they are very clever. Even though debts went up from 100K to now 1m (or more?), they have "made it" in life.. no matter how the mkt crash, they will still be in the money. both couple working, raking in nearly 20K a month (main income earner in high risk industry aka financial services)
 
too difficult to explain to them, so i just go along and agree 

if we do not take value of money and loan interest payment into account, your wife's friend is still out of pocket by $900k. only way to negate that is to sell that $2.5m property and downgrade to cheaper housing to have net in. Assuming they sell their $2.5m property at breakeven and buy a $1m condo to stay in, their overall net in will be $600k. In a way, maybe your wife is right to say they have made it, but conditional on their willingness to stay in a cheaper house and use the $600k to reinvest.

haha yea d value of d property doesnt reflect how much debt is taken. tats y SG has v few entrepeneurs, all playing d leveraged property game which requires income statements, hence d current property bubble.
 
N that guys MIL n wife r wrong. If say later this yr another global crisis n property crash -10 to -20%, their prop bot at $2.5M will b say valued at $2.15m, but their mortgage remains same value. Then their bank may ask them to topup d negative equity when the maintenance margin % is hit.
 
Assume they downpay $1M n took 1.5M loan, they may have to topup 2.5M - 2.15M = $350,000. So yes theyll still b in d money, but they need 2 know such situations have occured in d past, eg. 2008 & asian financial crisis.
 
Super worse case is if their property drops 40% in value, then all gains since their first HDB will b gone if bank ask for topup. N this assumes they paid for their first HDB in cash... if they took 80% loan, totally out of money liao.

0-20% drop = bo tai chi right since LTV is 80% previously
 
even drop >20% ... let's say slightly 25% ... bank rarely make margin call if the loan has been serviced timely and no credit bad history. i was told even during sars (2003) and lehman collapsed (2009), there was hardly anyone kena margin call. the 1997 financial crisis, yes, many were forced to sell their property because that time really sibei jialat and financial institution know sh.it how to deal with the problems.
 
as what we were told, bank balance sheet is super duper sibei tok kong ... won't easily foreclosure leh ... no?
 
i think sars time, hdb also give chance and let owner to defer payment for up to 6-months ...

there were def margin calls but not many until media picked up. banks watch individuals n corporates which r v aggressive n buying n maxing out loans. these guys they will easy easy give them mortgage, but when crash these same guys will kena makan.
 
D avg conservative household dont do such things so banks arent gona margin call so fast, but those aggressive types, banks have no mercy. My bank frens told me if QE didnt happen, confirm much more margin calls were gona happen.
 
Wat happens next crisis? We wish recovery wld b short n sharp like 2009, but nobody can tell d future right...
 
Eg. many kept saying interest rates will remain damn low for long time, but guess wat d US Fed started tapering already, forward rates r rising already. Once US economy is fixed in few yrs time, they wont care if SG property crashes due to SIBOR hitting 3-4%, they only care for themselves.

fully agreed on what you said. bank has no mercy, period.
bank is not charity and 1st priority to recover not just their capital but also their profits.
another thing is US Fed policy is always push out to save themself and political motivated. who cares what's happening outside.
but they themself keep haunting china to increase and keep china high gdp to sustain the world economy.

they only made $700k paper profit so for the 2.5mil property 1.8mil is out of own pocket...

Sidenote anecdote: My property agent/family friend called me yesterday to wish happy CNY and catch up. I asked how the market is for him, the usual reply came back. Private resale still holding for now or slight drop. HDB in mature estates or central areas also holding, but outlying estates seeing big drops. One place in punggol apparently sold 70k below valuation. Huat ah!

think the accounting for the profit is not so simple as to price 1 - price 2 = profit..
 
there is stamp duty involves and 2.5m stamp is ard 75k.. which is pretty signicifcate.. not forgetting agent fee  etc . you also assume that that they sell each house after paying for the house.. which may not be true. I wont be surprise that they already have 1 mil in the bank on investment, while the 2.5 mil is on low-int mortgage..
 
in any case, there are finer details that will determine if you could surive a crisis.
1) your mthly mortage amt ..
2) income source . 1-2 or more
3) cash buffer
4) % of loan
5) location of the property - ease of rent
 
most imptly, if that is your only house. if it is, then will be harder to sell. Too much emotion and logistic involve.

property agent and car dealer is the last person you want to ask for opinion
ironically, they are suppose the "professional" who has the know-how and first hand information to advise you. but they are blinded by greed and incentives to close deal. hence, good or bad time ... everyday is good to buy and sell.
 
that's why i'm dumbfounded that how property agent and car dealer actually benefit buyer and seller.
 
anyway, whether property market crash after cny or not ... huat ah!
every crash is opportunity and they are people who made a lot of money from each crash.
crash made money, economy skyrocketed like in 2012-2013 also made money no $1M no talk.

No lah, this fellow is family friend for over 20 years and knows we're not in the market to buy or sell. We were talking about my dad's recent illness and his recovery, then I itchy backside ask him how the market is now.
 
But agreed maybe it's a hopeful opinion since most people are not keen to face up to potential bumps in the road. I wish him well anyways, he's the plodding sort not the flashy type so whether market up or down he just quietly goes about his work.

correlation is questionable but as i mentioned before this time HDB resale doesnt have downside cushion of undersupply. HDB is d biggest mkt in SG, so when d biggest mkt is under pressure, likely everything else gets hit. Why? Coz if pple staying in HDB cannot get more cash, they cannot push up mass mkt, in turn mass mkt cannot sell at premium n cannot upgrade to prime, so its chain reaction.
 
As for COE impact if SG enters bear mkt, there is limited downside due to quota constraint but will still fall to a certain lvl.
 
For me, im back to looking at my old spreadsheet which i last used in 2009. Flipped out liao now waiting 2 makan some good deal. D9-D10 alot of resale under pressure liao

Not all agents are BS lah. Part timers like me will just call as i see it. selling a few more units a year isn't going to make me any richer anyway.
 
Having said that, i do see some agents really believe in the prata story they sell. They put money where their mouth is and are buying properties (mainly overseas) at this time.

true. Boom time or market crash all will have transactions. for an agent, his only job is to make sure the transaction is closed by him and not someone else.

i don't think there would be a "fatal crash" per se even there is a price correction especially the govt had put in the emergency brake (8 CMs) and already slowly braking the charging train (supply & demand). even it crashed, it gonna be knocks and dents but not fatal.

97/98 was worse than 08/09, coz 08/09 hDB was undersupplied, but 97/98 had HDB oversupply, LIKE NOW ONWARDS.... fingers crossed deja vu dont happen, but ever since QE happened n when i saw Asia rebound, immediately i thot 98 crisis n all d bankruptcies which followed... lets hope not.

 
 
really hope that public housing prices will go down for good..
 
the only problem is good chunk of the sales involve seller that are receiving their new bto / EC. Not really sell because of financial hardship.
 
Let's see how the next few mths pan out. Any change in immigration policy and stamp fee may have significate impact to mass mkt condo and public housing..
 
i don't think there would be a "fatal crash" per se even there is a price correction especially the govt had put in the emergency brake (8 CMs) and already slowly braking the charging train (supply & demand). even it crashed, it gonna be knocks and dents but not fatal.
 
 
really depend how good in them removing the ebrake..
 
if they release too slow.. the mkt may have freefall because herd mentality..
 
if they release too fast.. it will negate all their prev effort.
 
 
the only consolation is that if it freefall, most ppl have enuff reserve to draw on.

For them to remove say ABSD or SSD, I thk URA PPI has to show a 10-15% decline first, then they have reason to say that prices have stabilized n theres no more bubble.

property prices had run up 50% (ie: $800K+ 3-bedder pigeon hole condo already selling at $1.2M+) ...
$1M-$1.2M+ is the mass market price now ... which all the analist said "affordable" price range
decline 10-15% means still got 30-35% profit ... huat ah!

08/09 I am talking about how US real estate prices crashed...

 
property has 2 major attributes which its affected: 1) economic condition 2) supply/demand situation
 
both shld b analyzed separately n then added together to come to a conclusion.
 
Eg. 2 yrs ago i was posting abt possible supply/demand problem in SG prop but alot kept slamming me n saying im crazy etc. Back then QE was still ongoing so economy was not bad. Now taper liao plus supply/demand everyone reverse gear n become cautious.
 
Really nobody can tell future n i dont believe in efficient mkts, as in prop prices may not drop alot even if got over supply. such is life

Eh, corrections.
That is mathematically wrong.
 
Eg. 
Say $50 become $100, thats 100% increase.
From that $100, it just has to drop 50% to take it back to $50
 
Likewise if a property valuation has gone up from $1mil to $1.5mil (50% increase) it only takes about 30% decrease to take it back to where it started.
If historical price behaviour is anything to go by, sell offs / crashes are always more pronounced.
 
The reason why the CMs didnt have speedy impact on the upside will be the reason why the removal of CMs wont have speedy impact on the downside.  Unless they counter with removl of several CMs at one go, then maybe, just maybe

I'm hearing 2 school of thought from casual chat with colleagues,  although I'm not in properties, well,  just lunch kaki chat lor...  
One side would never believe the market will crash, or fall badly..  This group always believe the gov will not allow that to happen..  Political suicide to allow that to happen  since 2016 is just around the corner.. 
 
On the other group,  they don't believe gov can do much since sg is hugely affected by external factor and if market crash,  it's to their advantage since political change is the last thing people want when times are bad.. 
 
Hehehe...  Anyway,  I prefer market to drop to a sane level so that my kids don't have to sell backside just to buy a hdb  in 15-20yrs time.. Hehehe...

i was watching some youtube videos with regards to QE and tapering since it's hot topic this week
 
fed can single handedly "control" the usa market including major influence to the world market. yes, i understand that usa is a huge market, hence, they got the bullets.
 
on the contrary, spore is a small market, hence, govt can "easily" manage it by using policy and control measure, supply and demand, monetary and interest rate, etc.
 
i will definitely do not under estimated the govt invisible hand. just look at bto ... suka suka ramp up to 75000 and suka suka taper to 25000 .. hdb ... rental and buy new policy also can suka suka change.
 
since spore property market is small ... the chain reaction is impactful which means all based on bto and resale hdb. bto/hdb up and down has direct impact to private property market ... especially the mass market

I think it's a bigger problem for PAP in 2016 if they allow property prices to remain at current high levels. Immigration, jobs and inflation will become weapon to the opposition.

By Anthony Mirhaydari

 Crowd of people gather outside the New York Stock Exchange following the Crash of 1929.
 Back in December, the bulls were foaming at the mouth in excitement over the market’s perfect 45-degree uptrend and seeming invulnerability to any negative catalyst. After months of concern, the Federal Reserve took the first step to finally, five years after the financial crisis and well into an economic recovery, start pulling back on its most aggressive monetary policy stance in history. The December taper, taking the ongoing QE3 program’s monthly run-rate of bond purchases down $10 billion to $75 billion, seemingly went off without a hitch.  Click to Play			The Federal Reserve Finds Itself in a Bind	Paul Vigna and Michael Casey discuss the Federal Reserve meeting, and Dan Gallagher looks at the reaction to Apple's earnings.  This was helped by the fact that the Japanese seemed ready to keep flooding the global financial system with yen in a desperate effort to boost exports via currency devaluation. It was at this time that I wrote a column noting the similarities between now and the run up to the 1929 market crash. Not only, on a pure price analog basis, the market’s ups and downs remarkably similar, but the primary driver of the uptrend — aggressive Fed bond buying late into a bull market — was also shared. The scorn and mockery came next, as the “stocks can only go up” pure religion was defended. Price analogs were dismissed as pseudoscience. The fact the 1929 run up was so much stronger than now was cited as a dismissible offense for the comparison. And the classic “there’s money on the sidelines” justification was used to explain away historic levels of bullish sentiment, record margin debt, and aggressive positioning by retail investors.    Well guess what? The ghost of the 1929 crash is still haunting the market, and the price analog is still in play as shown above. A regression analysis for the dates shown in the chart above results in a R-squared value of nearly 90% — meaning that nearly 90% of the current market movements can be explained by what happened in 1928 and 1929. It’s the texture of the pattern that matters, not the values themselves. It suggests that we could see all of 2013’s epic melt-up rally reversed by April with the selling intensifying in March — which just so happens after the new drop-dead date for the latest round of the debt-ceiling title fight in Washington ahead of the mid-term elections. The selling has been ignited by the realization that cheap money from the central banks — like all good things — becomes a problem when indulged into excess. You know, mo’ money, mo’ problems. This time, artificially holding down the price of money in the major economies has sent hot money inflows into emerging-market economies like Turkey, Argentina and Russia. Now that interest rates are moving higher as the cheap money spigot is ever-so-slightly closed, it has set off a stampede to reverse these trades. Foreign stock prices are being hammered. Foreign currencies are being hammered. And the Japanese yen, used by so many hedge funds as a funding currency for “carry trade,” is now shooting higher like a bottle rocket as the Japanese suffer the negatives of a weaker currency (higher food and fuel prices and a trade deficit) without the positives, and additional bond-buying stimulus now looks uncertain. If stocks are following the echoes of the 1929 crash — with the ups and downs, like all technical analysis, a reflection of the shortcomings of human decision making and our susceptibility to behavioral and emotional weaknesses like chasing momentum and selling amidst panic — then what’s happening in the emerging markets feels a lot like the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Yes, there are differences. In 1997, we witnessed the collapse of many fixed exchange-rate regimes, starting with Thailand’s baht, as currency reserves were depleted. Most currencies of the countries under pressure now are free-floating or floating-but-managed regimes. But the similarities are striking. Then, as now, export-dependent countries throughout Asia were hammered by a sudden and violent depreciation in the Japanese yen. Then, as now, hard and fast currency drops resulted in import-price inflation, economic stagnation, the loss of dollar-reserve assets. And then, as now, it resulted in a quagmire for emerging-market policymakers as their central banks were forced to raise interest rates to stem the crisis, stabilize their currencies, and cap inflation, but pushing their economies deeper into a downturn as stock prices cratered. In 1997, after the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its worst point loss ever at the time, the solution was international bailouts and the Fed hitting the pause button on its policy tightening. The result was the final, terminal phase of the dot-com bubble in 1998 and 1999. Perhaps we see a repeat if the Fed, under Janet Yellen, decides to cave and keep the party going for a little while longer. The risk, of course, is that this will merely invite bigger problems down the road. For now, I continue to recommend investor protect themselves from a worsening crisis by focusing on defensive assets like Treasury bonds and making opportunistic short-side plays. Examples include a position in the leveraged Direxion 3x Treasury Bond BullTMF +2.22%  and a short against Brazilian steelmaker Companhia Siderurgica NacionalSID -0.06%  . Both positions are carrying gains of more than 7% since I added them to my Edge Letter Sample Portfolio. Disclosure: Anthony has recommended TMF and SID short to his clients. Anthony Mirhaydari is founder of the Edge, an investment advisory newsletter, as well as Mirhaydari Capital Management, a registered investment advisory firm.

spore property market ... 70-80% is public housing (including EC) and 20%-ish is private property
what say you ... who has the control? 
i cannot find another country with the property market is like this 80-20

75% is public housing and 25% is private in dollar value terms?
Or land area terms? Or what terms?
Gotta make sure we get that right.
 
75% of the population staying HDBs doesnt mean that the dollar value of this segment of the market is directly reflected , hor.....
 
I would take two steps back and analyse it a bit deeper than just that

the difference between the 2 era is Internet age and flow of information that's instantaneous through social media... There is fast.reaction for huge swing correction and rebound.. No longer a 10year recession.. I'm surprised that most economist can state the similarities but not the differences.. The magic question is always when is the correction...
 
How many thinks what would the strategy that should be deployed to capitalize on the correction or Recession..

yeah the internet had changed the world including the "high frequency" trading that trade is executed by super computer that trade billions and hundred of billions of dollars ... funds can be moved from country to country ... continent to continent ... with a push of a button
 
not to mention the simi bloomberg, cnbc, etc ... 24x7 news and "propaganda" ... running on the tv

I am one who doesnt like to draw any similarities nor differences to any event.
I'd rather just see each one seperately understanding their causes and implications.
Specifically regarding local properties, i did not foresee and still dont, a crash.
But as it is now at least a 20% downward price adjustment must be experienced to get me interested in considering property as an investment.
 
And if caveats lodged are anything to go by, the last six months hv seen D9 prices come off between 5% to 10%  already.  Who here is buying, looking to buy, or has the firepower to buy , at current prices and conditions! Kee chiu!  
 
None?  I thought so.

when asian crisis happened, d US stock mkt kept running up till 2000. im saying that asia can b in a crisis while US is still in bullrun. Most of d worlds consumption is still US n europe, it doesnt matter much if SG is in recession coz we dont effect anyone.
 
Tapering has begun n theres still US$65B to go. Thats at least 4-5 rounds more of stock mkts getting rattled everytime taper happens. Asia n emerging mkts r facing a massive carry trade unwind & as to how long more to go, i thk we're abt halfway done IMO.
 
India, turkey raised interest rates to stop capital outflow. SG doesnt have liquidity issue like them, but wat will cause SIBOR to jump is when Fed announces when theyll cancel ZIRP. Even before the actual event, expectations of rates rising will cause SIBOR to jump, so I'd listen carefully whenever Fed talks abt ZIRP n hints of cancellation. I dunno when this happens but Fed did talk abt 2015 being likely year of ZIRP cancel. If this is really true, then I expect SIBOR begin increasing ard 3Q14

there are always articles on doomdays in 2012, and article on silver lining during 2009... It all depends on which one do you believe and hence conduct a search on the types of articles. 
Seize the day.. be prepared for the worse to come even when market seems good, and be happy even the the worse has come. Seize the opportunities as well.
 
Even if market collapse, then how? Got to have some backup plans, savings etc. . What if market don't collapse and we always keep thinking it will collapse and keep staying at sideline, don't invest, don't spend.. stay small house even when actually can afford a nicer place... Life is so short... Then suddenly realise 5 Yeats, 10 years gone...

I use to worry this worry that.. this don't spend that don't spend, then one day realise that a huge chunk of my savings is in the market! and that's the main reason I felt stressed about $$ all the time..
 
Then realigned my portfolio 2 years ago.. instead if 90% invested, 10% cash, became 5% equities, 95% cash.. suddenly I sleep better, work wise also perform much better so income also better, and actually the cash cow is ourselves.. 
 
in fact spend more now but savings also more..quality of life improve bec suddenly realise $ are meant to be spent, not stay invested and let it grow mouldy. 
 
So my strategy for whatever doomsday be it short term or long term is very simple.. now minimal exposure.. when time comes, wack the market in 3 phrases.
 
Now just work and save and spend..

Then realigned my portfolio 2 years ago.. instead if 90% invested, 10% cash, became 5% equities, 95% cash.. suddenly I sleep better, work wise also perform much better so income also better, and actually the cash cow is ourselves.. 
 
in fact spend more now but savings also more..quality of life improve bec suddenly realise $ are meant to be spent, not stay invested and let it grow mouldy. 
 
So my strategy for whatever doomsday be it short term or long term is very simple.. now minimal exposure.. when time comes, wack the market in 3 phrases.
 
Now just work and save and spend..

Not commenting on right or wrong , becos nobody truly knows.
but at least you have your own strategy and you act on it .
That i respect.  
Well done. 
Good for you.

look at Russia and Brazil.. Worst scenario is default loh.. China never enjoy the status of a triple A like USA and the corporates are on credits but the consumers are not high geared like US.  
Just my thoughts anyway.

judging from the trend
it will happen every 10 to 12 years
if the last one is 2008/09
the next one will be somewhere 2019-2021
 
unless somebody stabilse the market but still there are punks who will violate the market for their own gains

from the perspective of Sg, the financial crisis are during 1997 (Arc), 2000 (dot com bubble), 2003 (Sars), 2008/9(Lehman), 2010/11(Europe).. Each is fast and.furious.

2010/11 euro crisis has almost zero impact in spore economy ... because govt did a very good job, no? 
and also because of usa and euro debt crisis ... interest rate remain near 0 for the longest time

75% is public housing and 25% is private in dollar value terms?
Or land area terms? Or what terms?
Gotta make sure we get that right.
 
75% of the population staying HDBs doesnt mean that the dollar value of this segment of the market is directly reflected , hor.....
 
I would take two steps back and analyse it a bit deeper than just that

 
I suspect that 75% number comes from the housing stock of private vs hdb. 
 
http://www.singaporepropertycycle.com.sg/market-trends/singapore-property-price-index-and-housing-stock/
 
IT should be easy to calculate the dollar value of private and hdb by estimating their relative value... 1.5-2 private = 1 hdb??

as at 2012, 922k (77%) hdb vs 277k (23%) private
with the ramp up supply of hdb/ec, the percentage of public housing should increase slightly
as at 2012, only 1.2M housing stock for the population of 5M ... no wonder property is sibei HOT

I don't know the exact number but 2 is probably reasonable.
 
Some guy calculated for 2011. Around 2 is probably realistic +/-50%.

property price up or down got nothing to do with QE, interest rate or debt crisis ...
 
it's because of snake, horse, yin/yang, fire and many more ...  LOL
 
http://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/very-challenging-horse-222010684--sector.html
 

Already, in the last quarter of the Snake year in 2013, we began to see property prices falling, and once the Horse year officially arrives on February 4 2014, we may experience a sharper fall in property prices.In the second half of the year, the "yin fire" is strong. This can cause property prices to rise a fair bit and then remain stable towards the end of the year. This is because the "yin fire" supports the "earth" element, which represents property. Therefore property prices would start to rise, but not at the same rate that overall property prices will fall in the first half of 2014.

Buffett invests with a long term outlook and only if the business makes sense. His investment approach is backed by rigorous analysis and confidence in a sound and capable management team.
 
Can you quote an example where he invests solely based on sentiments?

buffett famous quote is when he buy the share he has no intention to sell the share unless the company business is going down
 
many like to quote buffett but buffett not anyhow invest ... when he invest in the company, he actually bought enough shares that make him / Berkshire Hathaway a substaintial shareholder where he has direct access to the invested company

Buffett's famous words, " buy when everyone is fearful and sell when everyone is greedy " lean on sentiments.
 
Of course Buffett of all people would understand how sentiments and behavioural sciences impact the markets, he is one who has and will play that to his fullest advantage.
 
This is not to say that he is one big time gambler who will take rash bets.
But bets, he will take , thats a bet i will take.

I don't want to go into semantics but Buffett's famous words are not based on sentiments. It is based on human behavior and consequential impact on the markets. It is backed by logic. Sentiment (by definition) is based on emotion instead of reason; it has no concrete data to back it up.
 
But let's agree that he is damn good at what he does lah ok?

I didnt say it was based on becos base is too strong a word, so i say lean.
 
Human behaviour is not void of sentiments. Whether its driven purely by logic or not, i cannot say as the market ( not just stock) is sometimes just so crazy.   If only it could be deciphered with 100% logic, every trade would be a winning trade. 
 
Fear and greed are emotions, not necessarily logical
Why would some people be fearful of a small insect which can do no harm, while yet not be afraid of a animal fierce and strong enough to rip their limbs?  Where's the logic?
 
And yes, i agree, i never thought Buffett is otherwise from what he is known for anyway.

think the accounting for the profit is not so simple as to price 1 - price 2 = profit..
 
there is stamp duty involves and 2.5m stamp is ard 75k.. which is pretty signicifcate.. not forgetting agent fee  etc . you also assume that that they sell each house after paying for the house.. which may not be true. I wont be surprise that they already have 1 mil in the bank on investment, while the 2.5 mil is on low-int mortgage..
 
in any case, there are finer details that will determine if you could surive a crisis.
1) your mthly mortage amt ..
2) income source . 1-2 or more
3) cash buffer
4) % of loan
5) location of the property - ease of rent
 
most imptly, if that is your only house. if it is, then will be harder to sell. Too much emotion and logistic involve.

of course i know that. if you throw in too many moving variables, it just complicates the final calculation for a forum discussion unless we all attach an excel spreadsheet calculating the above and all scenario analysis.

Honestly, i am one of those who dont make much from the markets.
All i target is slow and steady gains over the years.
Every now and then, i do take some tactical bets, usually no more than $50k per pop.
So even if it goes up a fair bit, profits are hardly ever in the tens of thousands.

Ban UK overseas buyers: report
 
 
Today's report blames foreign property buyers for driving property prices out of the reach of many U.K. citizens. It says that in 2012 a total of 85 percent of prime London property purchases were made with "overseas money", and that two-thirds of overseas buyers were purchasing for investment purposes. 
It also notes that since 2012 more than half of all new homes in central London were sold to residents of Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, China and Russia, with just 27 percent being purchased by U.K. residents.

at the end of the program, the host ask what's your wish list ... i am fully agreed with one of the guest on these points 
 
please please please build bigger flat. spore already small ... not everyone can afford condo, landed property or even a car. but at least give them a bigger flat when they come home after work, they can at least enjoy and appreciate what they have achieve. bigger flat also motivate familty to have more babies although it is not 100% true formula but smaller flat definitely demoralise to build bigger family.
 
spore is already a little red dot. i guess the least the govt can do is to build bigger bto/hdb ... after a long day of work wiping table come home also can enjoy abit instead for facing 4 walls

Bishan median COV is zero? 
 
 
	COVs for resale flats fall to 4.5 year lowProperty Guru – 1 hour 12 minutes ago

The median cash-over-valuation (COV) for HDB flats has dropped yet again to $3,000 in the month of January, according to fresh market data. Previously, the median COV had fallen to $5,000 in December 2013. January's figure is the lowest since similar levels were matched in June 2009 during the global financial crisis. Eight out of 28 HDB estates reported zero or negative median COV, namely Bishan, Geylang, Jurong West, Punggol, Sengkang, Sembawang, Woodlands and Yishun. Despite the decline, HDB resale prices bucked the trend. They inched up by 0.3 percent in the month which reverses the general decline seen in the market since Q2 2013. Meanwhile, demand for resale flats remains tepid with the sales volume falling to 893 transactions last month from 910 in December 2013.

imo valuation is a snake oil... evaluator base on "their" data to valuate, and that's how they can push up the value .... it should have drop first before cov drop and not the other way round..

valuation using comparable transaction is the best way to value residential. This method has been around since pre-war era
 
otherwise how to determine whether to adjust valuation up or down?

imo valuation is a snake oil... evaluator base on "their" data to valuate, and that's how they can push up the value .... it should have drop first before cov drop and not the other way round..
 

i encountered a valuer who cannot even differentiate ceramic tiles from homo tiles. although it makes no diff to the final valuation figure, it shows up her (in)competence.
 
nowadays, there are homo tiles which look like marble flooring. one of the main diff is the feel of the grout line for any homo tiles. maybe can bluff lousy valuers and raise valuation up by a few K.

valuation using comparable transaction is the best way to value residential. This method has been around since pre-war era
 
otherwise how to determine whether to adjust valuation up or down?

toss a coin...

We will see prices come down.
There is no argument on the direction by now.
Question is magnitude and velocity of the drop.
That would determine the casaulty rate.

What 600-700 psf... Last time mass market condo got 400-500 psf also ah
 
Already said liao, mass market condo cannot buy one... It's no different from HDB except got security niah. Even facilities also jialat one... Ratio is 1000 units to one swimming pool...
 
Wan to buy condo, also get those in D9,10,11 type, if cannot afford those, then get those short supply neighbourhood like Leicester Rd or City Square type... More "exclusive" and freehold and not in HDB estate.
 
Avoid those in HDB estates. Hoh kua boh hoh jiak one... Siao one... Simi condo right next to HDB... Might as well save money stay HDB and renovate swee swee plus got one Porsche in MSCP.

For HDB, I think govt cannot afford it let it drop too much.  Or else Govt will get f**ked big time from the haves and the have-nots.  What they want is a compromise, otherwise they risk pissing off both sides and lose the vote in 2016.
 
HDB prices are the support level for private properties.   I guess 20% down is a comfortable compromise to keep HDB owners happy, allow them to upgrade to private, and also let new buyers afford to buy HDB.

Got. You like south or North?
 
South is Bintang. North... Segamat...

Published: Saturday February 8, 2014 MYT 12:00:00 AMUpdated: Saturday February 8, 2014 MYT 7:55:24 AMSingapore's wealth bubble may popby seah chiang neeThe city-state has attracted foreign wealth, but economists warn of trouble if tycoons were to pull out in the future.MONEY, plenty of it! So much is circulating around parts of Singapore – much of it from abroad – that some economists are worried.After years of success luring in foreign wealth, the city is now experiencing what an analyst calls a “wealth bubble” that is continuing to grow.Noted global economist Jesse Colombo warned that several bubbles were on the verge of popping, threatening the city with an Iceland-style economic meltdown. He predicted in Forbes that this could happen within years.They exist in property, Singaporean household debts and the bloated population of migrant workers.“Singapore (also) has a wealth bubble,” added Colombo, who had earlier forecast America’s housing bubble.For years, the republic had worked to attract high net-worth foreigners to its shores, a strategy that is unlikely to end any time soon.Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said last year: “If I can get another 10 billionaires to move to Singapore and set up their base here ... Singaporeans will be better off...”He indicated this would be pursued even if it worsens the rich-poor inequality.(In the last 10 years, the wages of the bottom 20% fell by 10% in real terms, while those for the top one-fifth grew by some 30%.)“I think Singaporeans will be better off, because they (foreign investors) will bring in business, bring in opportunities, open new doors and create new jobs,” Lee said. “I think that is the attitude with which we must approach this problem.”He’s following in his father’s footsteps.In the early 1980s, Lee Kuan Yew started to attract wealthy foreigners here to make up for a shortage of land and natural resources.Lee, now 90, used to invite wealthy entrepreneurs, including a number of Hong Kong billionaires, to witness the National Day parades as special guests – and gave them permanent residency.With low taxes, minimal corruption, protective banking laws and the abolishing of estate tax in 2008, his successors have succeeded in attracting more of them here.Today, Singapore has 27 billionaires, the fifth largest number in the world.New arrivals included US investor Jim Rogers, a Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, New Zealander Richard Chandler, Indian telecom tycoon Bhupendra Kumar Modi, several Australians and Hong Kong movie stars.One in 30 Singaporean residents is today a millionaire – doubling from 2008 to 2012. It has the world’s highest number of millionaires per capita.The government appears to be unfazed by warnings of potential trouble if foreign tycoons were to pull out one day.China feels differently. It started to curb the entry of hot money on concerns that capital inflows pose a threat to China’s economy.Not many Singaporeans agree with their prime minister that having more billionaires necessarily means more investment and jobs.“Some do invest here, but most simply park their money here and run their businesses outside,” said a retired banker.They drive up the cost of living for locals, especially in real estate and cars, he added.Colombo said Singapore’s total wealth rose by 8.7% in the past year alone to reach an average of US$282,000 (RM938,000) per adult.The danger is that when Singapore’s bubble pops, it would cause “wealth to decline significantly”.Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy associate dean Donald Low expressed concern about efforts to attract the super-rich here - even if they increase inequality.“Relying on inflow of foreign monies to finance real estate domestically is often a recipe for financial disaster,” he told The Independent Singapore.On perspective, the influx of so much money has some impact on the upper class, businessmen and property owners.Generating investment and jobs rests more with global investors than billionaires looking for a safe place to park their money.The Prime Minister is right in predicting that if more were to arrive, it would widen the economic gap between rich and poor Singa*poreans.Whatever benefits they have brought here are being unequally distributed, observers say.“While the rich have fun, locals are struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living,” a foreign TV journalist wrote.Earlier, under pressure from Europe, Singapore banks started to scrutinise foreign account holders as stricter tax evasion measures kicked in.This is to decide whether to send high-risk clients packing, said one source. They include wanted people accused of corruption elsewhere, criminals and drug traffickers.Foreign politicians have charged that, as banking secrecy is lifted in Switzerland, some tax evaders are shifting their attention here.Emotionally struggling Singaporeans are no different from people elsewhere when they see splurging wealth around them as they struggle to hold their jobs.PM Lee’s remarks, saying the presence of 10 foreign billionaires is more desirable than levelling economic inequality, has hurt his popularity.An undergraduate asked incredulously: “I don’t believe he said it. Was he quoted correctly?”Adding to his woes is the growing class divide in society.The recent misbehaviour of some wealthy residents – both foreigners and locals – in flaunting their wealth or thumbing their noses at ordinary people is adding public blame on his policies.Law Minister K. Shanmugam told the Financial Times that the rich-poor gap was very obvious.Recalling how he was cut off while driving one evening, first by a Ferrari and then by a Porsche, the minister added: “The middle class in Singapore has found costs rising because of energy, food and so on.”They find themselves squeezed since they don’t get the government subsidies that the poorest 20% gets, he added.

Last time i played 18 was about 3 yrs ago?
Managed to sell off my first set of Ping ISI custom orange dot clubs some years ago.
Now only left with my trusty set of steel shafted first generation Mizuno T-Zoids.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said last year: “If I can get another 10 billionaires to move to Singapore and set up their base here ... Singaporeans will be better off...”
 
He indicated this would be pursued even if it worsens the rich-poor inequality.
 
(In the last 10 years, the wages of the bottom 20% fell by 10% in real terms, while those for the top one-fifth grew by some 30%.)
 

 

 
Yes please LHL
 
Bring in more rich UHNWI to buy more of our D9 properties and party at pangaea and crash some ferraris. 
 
that would surely make my lower class life better off. Can't wait for the next billionaire!

1st tree house = $800+psf
2nd comes foresque residence = $1100-1200psf
3rd comes eco sanctuary = $1200psf
4th comes skywoods = $1250psf
 
from 800psf jump to 1200psf ... all 4 projects within the same location
a classic 50% jump ... for 1200psf drop back to $800psf ... requires 33% drop ... now only 0.9% drop?
 
 

 
so what the agents have told tree house and foresque buyers is true! they all had a handsome capital appreciation! No BS man

A reflection of how scared developers truly are.... And they are IN the market right?
I dont want soft landing leh, i want it to hit the ground hard the way it should...

 
they are not scared. hardly. just greedy and opportunistic as they should be
If act on Kwek advice immediately, PAP will be seen as pro developer leh...
 
Wasnt what they did when they introduced the DBSS to screw heartlanders? Or perhaps i was mistaken?

Why penalise foreigners from buying PRIVATE property?
 
Want to penalise, just penalise the foreigners from buying HDB lor.
 
Since the issue here is "foreigners snatching affordable housing from Singaporeans".
 
Don't tell me, Singaporeans expect private property to be considered affordable housing?

Sales drop but price remain steady man
 
http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/money/story/resale-prices-non-landed-private-homes-rise-january-second-straight-month-
he resale prices of completed non-landed private homes in Singapore rose last month for the second consecutive month, even as the number of transactions continued to drop.
 
Resale prices of these homes rose 2.3 per cent in January over December, after a revised 0.8 per cent increase in December over November, according to the latest data from the Singapore Real Estate Exchange (SRX) on Monday.
 
But the number of sales of such homes fell to 310 in January, a 9.1 per cent decline from December. The figure also marked a 70.2 per cent decline from January a year ago.
 
 
 
Part of the fall in transaction numbers was likely due to the Chinese New Year holiday that started at the end of January this year, said Mr Jeremy Lee, co-founder of srx.com.sg.

what happen the billion population of richies in china buy up 70-80% of the mass market private properties
then sell to peasant sporean ... no $5M no talk ... it's a free market right?

I see this as a curb to speculation. If the foreigner is genuine a home owner who is buying first private property here for stay, there is no ABSD. Penalizing speculators is right thing to do.

Plenty of inventory to go around for those singles looking to buy to stay.
Are we talking HDB or private?
Proper size or mickey mouse ?
>$2.5mil price or the below $2.5mil kind?
Landed or non landed?
 
There are many segments in our tiny property market but they are all somewhat linked.
A big move in any segment can lead the way for the other segments.

a lot still want to buy SG properties. Those who are priced out want to buy overseas.
 
The greed and fear factor is at all time high. No one is contented with leaving money in the bank.
 
Stock market can't even smell a 5% correction and bargain hunters are all back in droves

Many want to buy, not so many can buy.
With the US rates poising to rise, our Govt knows better not to allow more poorly calculated debt-taking.

The CM measures have diverted many mom and pop to consider riskier overseas properties that are marketed as "safe". All the usual packaging including 9% gross rental guarantee for 5 years etc
 
Many average couples and worse still, retirees are putting in a significant amount of savings into these properties. These people are not protected by the govt's CM and debt ratio rules. Many can buy overseas cos the upfront can be as low as just $10K all in.
 
i am neither fearful or greedy, i'll buy when i think it is "worthwhile". i have my own valuation of what real estate pricing should be.

I think its a fair move by MAS.
 
The key word is "owner occupied"
 
But lest anyone thinks it makes the market any better. Think again.
 
If rates up, all kena hit so no change.
For people who are buying to occupy, they are ready to buy anyway. They never really moved this market.
 
Its the additional or investors who drive demand up. This group are still faced with same rules. No change.

With all the CMs, the Govt is telling you in the face to stop the excessive buying and aggressive price escalation.
You wanna go against that?
 
While i will never ever advise "shorting" , at this point its not all that bad a direction.
Fair risk to assume if one doesnt have any chips besides the primary residence.

There are some D9 freehold units, fairly new, near paragon, low floor about $1800 psf now. It has come down already. It is quite attractive liao.  Can't really see it going lower. If I had the money, I would buy lah. But not enough money so hoping for lower lor.  If never hit lower then too bad, buy other locations lor. If indeed come down lower, then can buy lah.  I have no real position, just go with the wind.

Difference between investor and speculator?
 
Govt is warning speculator, but they don't discourage investing.
 
I have long accepted that I cannot get rock bottom prices, and cannot accurately time the market. I also didn't buy at the bottom and sell at the peak. Just in between, got feeling, can liao. Make sure can hold lor, that's all.

Actually hor... for people with household income above a certain level, if don't go expensive holidays, buy expensive cars, spend on expensive hobbies, just live a normal average lifestyle, can pay off a $2m to $3m property within 10 to 15 years easily.

Eh please leh bro... Not expensive holiday doesn't mean no holiday mah, inexpensive food doesn't mean $3 chai png mah, no expensive car doesn't mean take bus mah... There are still pretty decent but not super expensive alternatives to all of the above.

Eh please leh bro... Not expensive holiday doesn't mean no holiday mah, inexpensive food doesn't mean $3 chai png mah, no expensive car doesn't mean take bus mah... There are still pretty decent but not super expensive alternatives to all of the above. Still can buy branded stuff but just not so often lah, make sure the shoes last a couple of years, the watch lasts 20 years like throttle2's submariner, instead of M3 can buy second hand 335i mah, something like that lah

market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent
 
this will remain long drawn for another few more years before a sustained drop in price

I guess..there is no real need for most pte owner to sell at a lost.
 
HDB upgraders are bobian ..have to sell within 6 mths that's why sell below COV esp those at low flr.. hardly any buyers for these units.
Even at good time, their COV also min.
 
Some of PR colleagues that are currently renting are also looking at buying soon.. because there is no real saving compared to renting with cold cash even if the price goes down.

those driving car who want to save more money but then can;t stand the public transport the striaghtforward way is to ride bike. benefits:
bike <150cc - $7-8k can get you a nice bike, actually no need loan one de wat for pay 4% interest for such small sum 
road tax - $80 per yr
parking - hdb $18per month, outside almost zero, most buildings are free actually
maintenance - cheap cheap <$300 per yr
petrol - don think will exceed $50per month, can go JB pump then come back, worth it, no worry of jam. bike is faster but avoid peak hours

Drop in vulnerable road user fatalities 
3 The total number of fatalities decreased from 195 in 2011 to 168 last year, while the number of fatal accidents dropped from 192 cases in 2011 to 162 cases in 2012. 
 
4 In particular, fatalities involving two vulnerable road user groups namely motorcyclists and their pillion riders, as well as pedestrians declined in 2012. The number of fatalities involving motorcyclists and their pillion riders fell from 99 persons in 2011 to 76 persons in 2012, while total pedestrian fatalities dropped from 49 in 2011 to 44 in 2012, with the number of elderly fatalities showing a decrease from 26 in 2011 to 23 in 2012. 
 

 
 
Out of 163 fatal accidents - 76 persons are motorcyclist and their pillion riders..

most pte owners will not sell at a loss. U just need 1% of them to firesale (cover stock losses, kanna retrench etc) and u will see a major move in the market
 
i dont know how many "upgraders" will be forced to sell their HDB in the coming few years. I am sure a sizable number in Punggol/ sengkang where many yuppie couples have committed to many of the new ECs & condos that were launched over last 3 years. Many will continue to snap with all these launches thinking they can dispose their pigeon holes for $500K or more in 3 yrs time.
 
When price comes down, rental will also drop. it could make sense for a PR or foreigner to rent when that time comes depending on the prevailing interest rates

Reported PSF prices remain but developers give discounts and rebates and subsidies and ID packages etc....so actual PSF has dropped easily up to 10% for many projects.

For prices to drop more, must be ppl lose jobs, no money, have to fire sale... Like that time 10 years ago nobody wanted to buy, agents and developers all begging customers to buy lah please buy lah... Hahaha
 
If want prices to drop, either SG go into depression or very bad recession, or everybody must pakat die die don't buy and force sellers to reduce prices. How to pakat?

that is why in a down market, prices falls much faster than it took to go up
 
banks will under value properties. thereby exacerbating the fall further
 
So moral of story - keep enough cash and bring it out when showflats are a ghost town

Mate, actually it isnt all that crazy.
If we look at units being sold, they belong to the mid to low segment where quantum is low.
Say it however way they want, this group can be liken to the "retail" group.
The group that is at the tail end of the mkt.
 
Just like in other types of markets, the retail and lower end category is the one that suffers being the last mover.  
 
Thats whats happening now.  The higher end category which is usually the first mover is kind of a leading indicator although nothing is ever perfectly accurate.  The ones who truly can move the market are staying out leaving only the ikan bilis like us to hold the burning rope.

Of course I think it will go down 10-20%, some of the prime and value for money ones like Cairnhill Crest maybe down 5% only from here on. The HDB heartland ones will bear the brunt of 20%.
 
But this isn't a crash, just a dip. As long as ppl don't stop buying, the dip is 20% thereabouts at most.
 
If you want 50% down, something very drastic must happen.

I have a feeling at this point in time, even capital gains tax will not affect the buying much. Maybe fewer buyers, but not to the point of show flats becoming ghost towns.  People seem like they are buying for occupying, or for their parents, or their children... the kiasu syndrome setting in.  Irrational fear of not owning something for the future. Khaw made it worse when he announced "tapering" of residential land sales.  And I suspect many are cash rich Asian foreigners.

No i dont think they hv a few million in cash.

To many cash rich people, foreigners especially, a 10% to 20% drop in value is small potatoes. Of course this is alien to us penny pinchers but to them, what's a 10-20% drop in price when their buyers' stamp duty is already 10%?  They want to secure properties first and foremost, and less interested in whether their properties can make money or not, or if they are buying at peak/trough.  If you have dealt with filthy rich Chinamen before, and I literally mean filthy, you will know what I mean.  This is not hard-earned blood and sweat money like ours.
 
For the rest of the owners, including those holding multiple properties, they look at their sellers stamp duty and they seem to prefer to hold on to their properties. They have no need to "cut loss" or so it seems. For these people, making or losing a few % does not interest them.
 
Maybe we are approaching this the wrong way, we are approaching this like liquid markets like stocks and commodities.  To many foreign filthy rich folks from screwed up third world countries, Singapore properties are like blue chip long term stocks, buy already keep under the pillow, and best of all it represents a perfectly legal brick and mortar vehicle to stash their wealth in.

Developers are buying GLS plots at crazy prices too.  And they are the ones who can move markets.
Let me shed some light here.
 
Developers are developers.
No land no build no business
Just like car dealers.
No COE no cars to sell No business
 
Moreover developers who have been in this market long enough can still hve reasonable average cost psf.   
 
Notice that it the smaller developers who are paying bigger money?
They got no choice otherwise its game over for them.
So faced with prolong game with possible loss or immediate game over, whih do you choose?
Of course they choose to prolong the game.  So they have to buy at high prices.
 
The big guns with landbanks are holding back.

Yes buying, building and selling is their business.  No land, no business.  It is the smaller developers who have no choice but to buy.  The bigger ones are holding back on purchases.
 
However if you look at it the other way, if everybody knows property prices will drop, why are the developers with landbanks not selling some of their stock now?  Sell now can get higher price than if sell later, right?  And sell already got money to save for later purchases, right?
 
Because the truism remains that land is a precious commodity, if you have it, keep it, don't sell.
 
Also there is a big possibility that despite the current gloom, there is a high chance that the market will not crash and any dip will be met with a rebound.
 
And developers also know that if sell already, keep cash, later no more GLS, any land they buy in the future will cost a lot more than their holding cost of current stock/landbank.
 
As developers 10%, 20% drop is less fearful than not holding any land to sell.  Which is almost the same mentality as some buyers, the fear of not having any property (or properties) overwhelms the possibility of a mere 10-20% drop in value of their properties.
 
Lastly, given the large economic pie the construction and property sector takes up, along with home loans business of local banks, you can bet that the SG Govt is on the developers' side.

Developers are not in the business of buying and selling land for immediate profits.
Developers are in the business of developing and adding value to a piece of land for sale or rent so as to make many more times profit
Developers are not in the game for 2 yrs 3 yrs 5yrs.
They are in it for much much longer than that.
It is exactly that which makes them resilient to short term swings.
So they may continue to buy some whether high or low.
Its like how some long term investors do their averaging.
High also buy low also buy. As long as got inventory , the business can continue.
But clearly those with strong landbanks are not really too keen to load up.
This i repeat explains the reason why we see the smaller ones winning the bids lately.
Becos they got no "inventory" so they LL hv to buy.
 
I am not saying that market will crash 50%
I am not denying that in the long run (beyond) 10yrs 20yrs, property will move up.
But for now for sure i see no upside for property investors in the short term
Not sure which part of that you disagree in.
 
Anyway i hv said my piece and the folks here can read and decide for themselves if what i say makes any sense.  So i leave it as that

I think viceroy and myself agree with most points . 
Just that he firmly believes that market wont come off at all, while i feel it will, 20%
 
Doesnt matter either ways becos the most important is putting money where the mouth is as i said.
I do that all the time, so even if wrong, at least i made my move.
 
Thats all.

but gahmen wont allow 20% fall, at most 10% or less, if more than that maybe they just take off the ABSD and loan ratio. 
 
so at most u get to save on the ABSD money

To many cash rich people, foreigners especially, a 10% to 20% drop in value is small potatoes. Of course this is alien to us penny pinchers but to them, what's a 10-20% drop in price when their buyers' stamp duty is already 10%?  They want to secure properties first and foremost, and less interested in whether their properties can make money or not, or if they are buying at peak/trough.  If you have dealt with filthy rich Chinamen before, and I literally mean filthy, you will know what I mean.  This is not hard-earned blood and sweat money like ours.
 
For the rest of the owners, including those holding multiple properties, they look at their sellers stamp duty and they seem to prefer to hold on to their properties. They have no need to "cut loss" or so it seems. For these people, making or losing a few % does not interest them.
 
Maybe we are approaching this the wrong way, we are approaching this like liquid markets like stocks and commodities.  To many foreign filthy rich folks from screwed up third world countries, Singapore properties are like blue chip long term stocks, buy already keep under the pillow, and best of all it represents a perfectly legal brick and mortar vehicle to stash their wealth in.

Are these cash rich buyers here, now? Nope they are not.
 
Those who are holding, is there a need to cut? Nope, but nobody likes to see red on a valuation report and it isnt a question of need to cut or not.  As long as they see that opportunity knocks elsewhere, they would rather take a small hit. 
 
 Anyway, thats history. We talk current.
how many of these super cash rich are out there looking to buy loads of properties in Sg now?
Definitely not as many.  Rich also not stupid mah.

20% is not a big drop as it has gone up a lot.The Govt knows that the market needs to absorb a drop and hv the ability to absorb it.
It is healthier than prices ballooning 
 
And you think the Govt can so precisely "allow" or "disallow" the percentage fall?  Hahah
 
By the way, the Govt slapping so many CMs is already telling you that they are ready to take the market down!  Signal so in your face you still dreaming ah??

Not disagreeing with you bro. I believe it will come off too. 
 
But as you said, for most property buyers (since speculators have been weeded out) it is a long term thing, not for short term profits.  So despite the generally accepted sentiment that prices will dip a certain %, there are still people buying and that accounts for the long queues at show flats.
 
I belong to this group of people but I am looking at a different market segment, namely bigger sized prime freehold units and prime freehold landed.  For these segments, a good one is hard to come by, and if I see a good one for sale, at a relatively reasonable price considering the current climate, I will still buy.  Of course I am aware of the high possibility of prices dipping but a good property is rare and if it comes on to the market, I may not hesitate to buy it.  Because property is for the long term.

so many CMs to control the price from going further but until when they want to reduce the price? 50%? the demand will jump in again. so dont dream drop so much.

agree property isnt stocks, just keep it, esp in sg whereby land is scarce, its like more valuable than gold.

Property is for long term. Absolutely.
 
And You've said it.
You are looking to buy but only if you see a good one at reasonable price considering current climate.
What would be reasonable price then?
 
If you are one of those in the market for $20m to $30m type of properties then we hv nothing to duscuss already becos those kind are more about the heart and feeling.
 
But if you are in market for $3mil to $5mil property,  it is still sensitive to many factors leh, dude
bought liao last year, exercise on July
Well done.
 
No wonder you scared drop, muayhahah.
 
Good luck , jul to sep 2013 is record peak for resale private.
 
But my question is now, now now.
Now can you buy another?
Even if you can, will you?
 
No?

Yes bro. Our govt can will the property market to go up or not to crash. Their measures are all powerful and immune to external events.  
 
Too bad they all went on holiday in 1997-1998
 
Also in 2001-2004

20% drop is not a crash lah.  With a 20% drop, most if not all owners are still in good stead with the banks.
 
But if 40-50% drop in price, many owners will be in negative equity and that's when banks will require substantial top-ups and there will be many foreclosures.

i agree with you...if you looking for a own-stay property.. it's has a very different set of consideration than investment property. If you see your home as a place to reflection of you and there is no 2 house that is the same.  Price moving upwards or downwards become irrevelant to you, although , you still need to check you affordablity.

To me, condo beside hdb block in the heart of hdb estate is really a marketing boon by developers.
Becos Singaporeans are so 爱面子, they are willing to downgrade to a much smaller place in a private compound beside the hdb block they used to live.
 
Uniquely Singaporean!

in todays context, for a simple cost equation comparing staying in hdb or neighborhood condo, could be work out quite easily. Just these 4 items,
 
1) raised social status from hdb dweller to private.
2) With security guards.
3) Swimming pool,gyms, bbQ pit, etc..
4) Free carpark.

But in popular estate esp those next to mrt, there is a  more rowdy crowd. Saleman at the door etc. Funny mad men lurking below at the void deck.

at redhill mrt area , there was this mad man that shout every morning ard 6+.. he will yell for ard 30mins..before he calls it a day..
 
then another one who carry a guni sack and walk ard the estate.. one of my neighbour kena punch by him.. because he didnt give way.. :|
 
There were other matters like not enuff parking space, theft at the corridor and no lift at carpark .. We spoke to MP.. but MP.. wah lao.. MP didnt have time for us.. and his kaki actually told us that "we have to live with it.. because we are staying hdb..." *suck*
 
Once in a while, there is the bad children lurking ard.. I remember there was a chinese boy who ask/cheat $$ to eat lunch.  Then another indian boy less than 9 yr old.. also asking for $$.. And some neighbour saw him smoking..
 
Forget to add.. sometimes got superman or superwoman that does not stay in the estate.. to come to fly.
 
Aniway.. i hope these is only happening in redhill. That place very "happening".

I think there is no property bubble in our market. Property bubble occurs when the prices increase drastically, but our market is like this from begining. Only thing change is the high interest rate and direct foreign investment.

You misunderstood lah
 
He is saying that market will come off 15% but for the Bank even if property valutions drop 30% , bank can still absorb, no problem.  In other words, he is saying DBs very oon lah...no need to worry that a drop in property will cause any harm.  
 
But if price drops more than 30%?  Wonder if his knees will shake a bit or not?

From ST
For four years, Mr Luo Yong, 44, dreamt of migrating to Canada.
 
His hopes were dashed last Wednesday when news emerged that Canada had decided to scrap its 28-year-old investor visa scheme due to a huge number of applications from Chinese millionaires.
 
The scheme had been frozen since 2012 to clear the backlog. The latest development meant that an estimated 46,000 applications from Chinese citizens could be dumped, according to the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post (SCMP) daily.
 
"My mind went blank at the news," said Mr Luo, who makes about half a million yuan (S$103,300) a year as manager of a Beijing-based firm. He had sent his 16-year-old son to a high school in Canada two years ago in preparation for the whole family's move there. "I couldn't believe it that I had waited so long for nothing."
 
Affluent Chinese like Mr Luo have made international headlines over the past few years for dominating investment-for-immigration schemes. They leave mainly because of China's food safety, and air and water quality problems, as well as its stressful education system.
 
The exodus of rich Chinese could accelerate further this year, as China's pollution woes deepen and the government cracks down on corruption and proposes to raise taxes on the rich to close a yawning income gap.
 
The proportion of wealthy Chinese who are planning to migrate abroad - or who have already done so - surged to 64 per cent from 60 per cent a year ago, a survey of over 393 millionaires released last month showed.
 
In fact, one-third of the 41 super-rich Chinese respondents - who have at least 100 million yuan in assets - have already migrated abroad, according to the survey by the Hurun Research Institute, which compiles an annual list of China's richest people.
 
The lure of foreign citizenship has seen almost 10 million Chinese leave their home country over the past quarter-century, said Centre for China and Globalisation (CCD) professor Wang Huiyao.
 
And wealthy Chinese have stashed away a cumulative US$658 billion (S$830 billion) offshore, estimated London-based consultancy WealthInsight.
 
For this year, the top-most popular destinations cited by respondents to the Hurun survey were the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia, in descending order. Singapore was at No. 5, added Hurun.
 
The Lion City has slipped down the rankings - in 2011, it had been the third most popular country after the US and Canada.
 
The slide came after Singapore raised the investment threshold for migration in 2011, according to Shenzhen-based firm China Business Immigration (CBIEC).
 
On its website, which lists the number of visa approvals for various countries, CBIEC stated it facilitated just five individuals in obtaining Singapore permanent residency, compared with over 130 cases - most of them for families - in 2010.
 
While previous waves of migrating rich Chinese had concentrated on mature and stable countries like the US, Canada and Singapore, the nouveau riche these days are diversifying into other places like Europe, Australia and even South Africa, said Ms Nancy Zhang, an immigration middleman for millionaires in China's prosperous eastern provinces.
 
Nine in 10 applications for Australia's one-year-old millionaire visa scheme are from China, SCMP reported last week.
 
Meanwhile, some debt-ridden European Union states such as Greece and Cyprus have raised eyebrows at home for allegedly offering their citizenship too cheaply to the Chinese in exchange for investment and loans to local governments.
 
Chinese entrepreneurs - and some officials - are apparently eager to bite.
 
"In China, it's not easy to be 100 per cent clean when doing business. So some Chinese who have made their fortunes are eager to get citizenship abroad quickly," said Ms Zhang, who declined to give the name of her agency.
 
"Getting a foreign passport is an exit strategy in case the corruption probes that (the government of President Xi Jinping) have been expanding over the past year target them."
 
Portugal, in particular, has been a hot spot, noted Mr Xiao Ming, a CBIEC marketing manager.
 
The agency has facilitated about 400 successful applications for migration to Portugal - a 100 per cent success rate - as of end-2013, he said.
 
"The rich Chinese's attention has shifted to Europe, especially Portugal where the immigration policy is clear-cut and without risk."
 
China's outflow of wealthy Chinese is likely to continue in the coming years, predicts Prof Wang.
 
Countries like the US and Singapore have launched schemes in the past year to attract more investment and high-level talent to their shores, and more Chinese are likely to respond, he added.
 
The CCD is among Chinese think-tanks urging Beijing to act to reverse this wealth and brain drain.
 
Suggested solutions range from cleaning up the environment to opening up more sectors to private investment so rich Chinese would keep more money at home, and schemes to attract foreign talent.
 
Meanwhile, the queue to leave is long.
 
Ms Lucy Fang, in her 30s, whose family applied to a few countries including the US and Britain early last year, is splitting her spare time between watching American sitcom Two Broke Girls and British hit serial Downton Abbey as part of her preparation for the move.
 
"I'll go to whichever country gives me residency first," said Ms Fang, who works in her family's interior lighting company in the eastern Zhejiang province.

Let say one China man buy a S$ 2.5mil house and get to become new citizen.  After 5yrs he sell the house to another China man who then become new citizen . Does it mean one house keep on filping can create many new citizens ? No wonder China man now turn to commercial properties , no need to wait 5yrs to sell and also no additional stamp duty .

Very tempted leh...  2 mins walk to Paragon... fairly new unit... spacious... very attractive... if the price drop some more I would not be able to resist.

walao ... planting seed already?
they the developer will do anything
 
 

Singapore may start easing some of its property measures if home prices drop as much as 10 percent this year, according to the chief executive officer of the city-state’s biggest developer.The government may remove some curbs that it had said were for the “short term,” such as stamp duties or taxes for homebuyers, said Lim Ming Yan, president and CEO at CapitaLand Ltd. (CAPL) in an interview in Singapore yesterday. It may also tweak rules for loan limits, which are very stringent, he said.“If the market should moderate down by another 5 percent, 10 percent, perhaps they will have to unwind,” Lim said, adding that it’s his personal view that conditions were not yet in place for the measures to be loosened.

hence, no $1000-$1200psf charge to consumer is NO TALK !
 
if really want to see consumer price at $700-800psf ... the land must be bidded below $500psf ...
 
bid $500psf ... govt no sell land (below reserved price)
bid above $500psf ... developer need to sell high too
 
so ... consumer lan lan have to pay the price la!

Both ways die, but why are there developers still buying at high prices today?
 
Want to know? Then go read my explanation earlier.
The secrets that developers and agent dont want you to know.
 
Notice how the expensive bids are by the small players?
Notice how the big boys dont want to bid so high and let the small ones buy at high price?

Property bubble unlikely in Singapore: Citi
 
no bubble but will it drop 15-20% 
 

The chance of a property bubble in Singapore is very slim as housing loans only account for a small portion of property values, according to comments from Citigroup which were reported in the media.Based on its analysis of government data, the country's $203 billion worth of mortgages amounted to 24.2 percent of the value of residential properties in Q3 2013.
 
“Nobody has walked me through the mechanics of a total crash of the real estate market for it to be compelling,” said Michael Zink, Head of Citi’s ASEAN operations.“Ninety percent of households (in Singapore) live in a home that they own, so where’s the bubble?” he asked, adding that many households here are financially very stable.In addition, about 82 percent of Singaporeans live in public housing and most of them have already paid off their mortgages, noted Singapore-based Zink, who has lived in other Asian cities such as Jakarta and Guangzhou.“The potential for a bubble has been greatly deflated” thanks to the government’s series of property cooling measures, especially the TDSR framework imposed last June, added Nicholas Mak, Executive Director and Head of Research at SLP International Property Consultants.Following a recent Forbes article claiming that the city-state is heading for an “Iceland-style meltdown”, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said last month that household balance sheets here have strengthened, while new housing loans have declined.

People say that Developers will always be right about the market. Since they bid high price for land means property prices will continue to go up.
 
I say PWUI to that.
 
Now first report of developer writing off $110mil.....
I foresee more writeoffs going to happen when the smaller developers get whacked.
 
Muayahahahahahahaha, yeah!

Developers are not in the business of buying and selling land for immediate profits.
Developers are in the business of developing and adding value to a piece of land for sale or rent so as to make many more times profit
Developers are not in the game for 2 yrs 3 yrs 5yrs.
They are in it for much much longer than that.
It is exactly that which makes them resilient to short term swings.
So they may continue to buy some whether high or low.
Its like how some long term investors do their averaging.
High also buy low also buy. As long as got inventory , the business can continue.
But clearly those with strong landbanks are not really too keen to load up.
This i repeat explains the reason why we see the smaller ones winning the bids lately.
Becos they got no "inventory" so they LL hv to buy.
 
I am not saying that market will crash 50%
I am not denying that in the long run (beyond) 10yrs 20yrs, property will move up.
But for now for sure i see no upside for property investors in the short term
Not sure which part of that you disagree in.
 
Anyway i hv said my piece and the folks here can read and decide for themselves if what i say makes any sense.  So i leave it as that

As i said, developers are not immune.  Just becos they buy land at high prices doesnt mean that they can sell it at the profit they wish.
 
Only property agents and novice in the property markets will tell you to look at developers to take the lead.  They will want you to think that prices will always go up, even in the near term (1-2 yrs)
 
See my earlier explanation on why developers continue to buy at high prices.
And also take note of the ones who are buying, they are the ones who are short of "inventory" (land)
 
Liken this to COE, whether price is high or low , dealers will still buy COEs.
Why? Becos without COEs, they got nothing to sell.
Imagine if dealers get penalised with a fine if they dont use the COE within a month.
Or if they are not allowed to buy COEs until a buyer puts 50% down for a car
Now that would change the game, wouldnt it?

It's also normal for people to commit suicide when they realised whatever they build up over the years has become dust.

Oh really, then why Wheelock need to write off $110mil leh?

 
Developers are not always right, In fact they are "right" as often as anyone else.
 
But high bid price would mean that they will resist lowering price unless it is the last resort. And i think they can hold out for quite some time. I didnt study their financials but based on sale volume alone for the past 4 years, they have probably made 7-8 years of money already to buffer against a drop in transaction volume. They could even survive well if transaction drops to 7,000-8,000 for whole of 2014.
 
Wheelock write off 100m because they overbid for the land. Most of the bidders put in $550-650 and wheelock won it for $790. The write off translated to revaluation of land to $630 which is still a very high price and nowhere near the $400 region before the bubble grew.
 
In truth, demand is still very strong, as evident from the fact that people will rush in if quantum is a bit lower, nevermind the area also smaller. Nowadays, 3 BR above 1,000 sf is considered a premium 3 bedder already. So to see any real drop in price (in psf, not in quantum), Govt must introduce MORE CMs!

It is true to a great extent that GLS price will set the market.  
 
I am sure you will not be seeing any more record GLS price going forward. That will indicate that psf will likely remain the same or drop 5% or so.
 
Quantum wise might drop by 10%, but that is because area also drop by 10%.
 
If market does move down more than what developers expect, they also have no hurry to sell. 5 years is a very long time. 
 
in the past, developers take 1 year to sell 70% and another 2 years to sell the remaining 30%.
 
Now it is "normal" to sell 70% within a week, or a few months if your pricing is high! I think the govt must release another 40,000 - 50,000 confirmed list units to quench the demand for investment property!

write off means developer will slash price?
 
if no slash price ... what is the write off for?

 
no slash price lah
 
developers all brudder brudder. Won't go and spoil the market one. Moreover, it will cause the first "VVVVIP" buyers to cry father cry mother.
 
slash price is to revalue land, probably

i have seen 25% discount and still the same as comparable projects. Dunno how they can justify jacking up the "initial price" by so much.
 
overseas projects also the same. discounts here, rebate there, somemore TOP still got another rebate. End up nett price higher than other projects sold locally

The last wave of buyers is usually the largest as the most resistant ones sitting on the sidelines finally succumb to the temptation to join the mass of lemmings. 
 
The buyer pool in Singapore's property market has been almost fully exhausted (a large part helped by the government's cooling measures) and we should be in the first leg of the bear market.
 
As liquidity continues to be tightened worldwide led by QE tapering efforts, funds will continue to flow out of Asia into the U.S. and Europe, and prices are inevitably correcting.
 
I have an uneasy feeling that we are experiencing the calm before the storm. Something major is brewing and these are strong candidates to become the tipping point, the black swan event that triggers the next crisis:
 
a. one or more of the fragile five begin to get downgraded by ratings agencies as their bond sales falter and their governments are caught between the devil and the deep blue sea in terms of interest rate hikes and massive inflation fears
 
b. Thailand's political problems escalate into economic turmoil and shortsellers begin hitting hard at the Baht, forcing the government to raise interest rates to unhealthy levels in a futile bid to fight the outflow of funds; fear spreads within Asia as contagion takes root and bubbles begin bursting
 
c. China's shadow banking system gets even more exposed as the government gets swamped by the need to bail out an ever-increasing of failing investment trusts
 
It would be wise to tread carefully at this point in time; start to deleverage and hold cash to reduce exposure to the markets.
 
 
Hello, prices have been slashed already , in the form of rebates, discounts, vouchers etc.....So, you should buy leh, waiting for what?Ps. Mickeymouse units are far from representative of the real market.

The buyer pool in Singapore's property market has been almost fully exhausted (a large part helped by the government's cooling measures) and we should be in the first leg of the bear market.

To make it simple; if the market are expecting a big drop it wont drop, just like some bros said here experiencing calm before storm. 
 
However if everyone expected a storm, I am afraid only a small storm will come. Why? Everyone is ready for it, the moment the property price drop 10%, some people see it as a bargain and rush immediately to showflats. 
 
How to make price drop further when our mindset says 10% drop is a bargain for property. Just like High COE, when COE drop 40k people rush to the car showrooms. 
 
A crash has to happen when everyone caught unguard

Yea, those waiting at the sideline can testify this. Even when it drops 20% still won't budge... sup sup water only! People will just wait and wait and wait and wait... may or may not buy eventually because of the waiting LOL
 
In a nutshell, property is definately coming down by 20% or more in the next few years. When it drops by 20%, I'll start my home shopping again in the midst of a probable recession. Cash is going to be king because INT will be high enough to make a dent on most pockets.

First DBSS flats go on resale market, asking price as high as $780,000
 
buy $300k+, sell $700k+ ... that's every sporean dream 
huat ah!
buy $700k+, sell $1M? 
 
 


SINGAPORE - The first HDB flats under the Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) have been put on the resale market, after reaching the minimum occupancy period of five years.
 
Some flat owners are asking for as much as 60 per cent more than what they paid five years ago.
 
The Premiere on Tampines Avenue 6 was the first HDB flat project designed, built and sold by a private developer.
90 per cent of the development are five-room flats, which were sold for between $308,000 and $450,000.
 
Now, online listings for some of these properties have prices starting at $650,000 and going up to as high as $780,000.
That's $70,000 to $200,000 more than other five-room flats in the same area."I think many owners are, in a way, testing the market to see whether the market is willing to accept their asking price. Another reason is that perhaps many of them feel that DBSS as a public housing is of higher quality than the normal HDB flats," said Nicholas Mak, executive director of SLP International Property Consultants.

that's true, the top 1% rich ppl are all waiting for a big drop. Institutions also move out of SG real estate long time ago liao
 
However, there are middle to upper middle income marginal buyers (representing around 20% of population) dying to jump in at the slightest push.
 
Even if they do not jump into SG, they will jump into international waters. I have been in the midst of international project launches and even without much press publicity, i can say their sale rate is comparable or even better than SG projects.
 
Most buyers know nuts about what they are buying into. But they are attracted by the low quantum (usually around 300K). Some even buy multiple units.
 
So either a crisis comes along, or the demand for investment will not be quench

More CMs or release of GLS confirmed list sites may dampen sales in SG. But investors, like crack addicts, will look for other outlets. Such as Iskandar, Manila, BKK, Yangoon, London, melbourne etc etc

Bro, 
 
It actually depends on the situation. A lot of it has to do with inertia. Yes, Isaac Newton's first law of motion applies to human behaviour as well.
 
Prior to Lehman Brothers' collapse, Bear Stearns had already failed but that was insufficient impetus to start the herd fleeing due to the huge inertia that was in place. 
 
Immediately after the much larger Lehman Brothers collapse, the inertia to remain in bullish territory gave way. Many investors went into panic mode and started liquidating their holdings. That led to the crash in the equity markets and shortly after the property markets. 
 
The inertia at this juncture had become that of motion towards freefall. For the next two years or so, the markets showed few signs that they were ready to recover.
 
DJIA bottomed only at slightly above the 6k mark, a vast fall of more than 50% from its peak.
 
This happened only after the Feds had sufficient backing to bring about the controversial QE programme. Bring it on too early and they could have killed the USD immediately. They had to wait for the opportune time so that the QE programme would appear to be an angel instead of a devil.
 
The markets rallied as the fear abated quickly and greed rapidly took control. Smart money moved first and were responsible for pushing the indices above key resistance points. Retail investors came in only after several rounds of consolidation.
 
Fast forwarding to 2014, we see that DJIA has been breaking new highs, fuelled by greed and bolstered by huge liquidity returning to the U.S. from Asia and the emerging markets. As more and more problems arise in the emerging markets and Asia, DJIA will break even greater highs.
 
Once the impression that DJIA has become the new safe haven (rosy growth indicators, jobs reports, etc) that has been established, it would be time for the smart money to short the very markets that they had been pumping skywards post-2009. They know that the herd will run from the new danger zone (Asia, EMs) to the new haven (U.S. and later Europe).
 
When that takes place, we know what will happen to Asia and the EMs.
 
 

To make it simple; if the market are expecting a big drop it wont drop, just like some bros said here experiencing calm before storm. 
 
However if everyone expected a storm, I am afraid only a small storm will come. Why? Everyone is ready for it, the moment the property price drop 10%, some people see it as a bargain and rush immediately to showflats.

without CM, prices would probably be at least 10-20% more.
 
Met a developer last night. Confirmed my gut feel that this year there will unlikely be any significant correction in new project price PSF
 
While he acknowledged demand for new SG condo has plunged, he will still be able to ride out 2014 in the black. However he is quite pessimistic about 2015 onwards. That's when we will likely see a notable price reduction.
 
Also revealed that some of the bigger developers have started trimming their BD or acquisitions team to prepare for the storm ahead
 
So genuine buyers and investors, hold on for another year!

CDL open his mouth again ... "the invisible hand will do something when market is not so good"
 
CDL warns of tough times as property curbs remain
 
 

Mr Kwek said: “In view that the Government has very recently announced … that it will not be relaxing the property cooling measures soon and will further tighten foreign labour in the construction sector, macro headwinds are expected to continue to weigh on the domestic property market.
 
“I’m not as disappointed (because) if you read the Finance Minister’s speech carefully, he said (the Government) is not engineering a collapse of the property market … It doesn’t matter if they treat it today or tomorrow, as long as they have the mindset that we have to do something when the market is not so good.”

It would be wise to tread carefully at this point in time; start to deleverage and hold cash to reduce exposure to the markets.

hard to time the market - yes
 
but u should have your own view of what is the intrinsic value of the property. Risk can be minimized if you have the ability to hold without rental.
 
Eg, Freehold city fringe drops to $1,000 psf. Will it drop further to $800? Perhaps. But is it good value at $1,000 psf? That's up to you

Personally I am keeping most of my powder dry now, about 80% with the remaining 20% vested in direct business investment, gems and equities.
 
Timing the market is near impossible however it is still important to observe the dynamics and adjust one's portfolio to match.
 
In the long run, due to the inherent flaws and weaknesses of fiat currency, inflation remains the dominant force that erodes one's cash holdings. Thus being in cash perpetually is a bad investment strategy.
 
However, sharp rises and ebbs of the markets due to psychological plays can cause more damage to one's wealth (and ego) than just pure inflation.
 
I feel one of the best analogies to investment is the weather and how it affects us.
 
If it has been drizzling lately and there are signs of storm clouds on the horizon, should one remain stubborn and refuse to believe that a storm is approaching and seek shelter?
 
On the other hand, if there is nary a storm cloud in sight but one has been completely drenched by the one that just passed, should he succumb to fear and remain indoors all the time?
 
The key to investment, in my humble opinion, is to be observant of several things:
 
a. one's own emotions of greed and fear
 
b. the environment i.e. other investors, market sentiment
 
c. changes to the underlying structure of the investment vehicles that one participates in
 
After observing, one then needs to act on his observations because hypothetical situations will remain theory until one puts his plans into practical actions.

So far over the past decade, investing in regular amounts into a highly diversified portfolio regardless of market conditions works for me. 
 
But I have to admit that I do not have the psychological resilience to move my life savings in and out of the market. 
 
The few times which I tried using a small portion of my money I failed miserably 
 
But I do respect those who can and do it successfully

There is no absolute right or wrong. If your method has served you well then it has been good for you. 
 
My personal view is that one needs to be constantly learning, growing and changing as everything else in the investment universe is doing so.
 
If for example an investment move causes me unhappiness or misery, there are a few possible reactions that I can have:
 
a. remain status quo and hope that the source of unhappiness or misery disappears after a while
 
b. change my own way of understanding, thinking and feeling so that the extent of unhappiness or misery is reduced
 
c. change my actions and behaviour so that the root of my grief is indirectly or directly resolved
 
Reaction a is the easiest because it requires no extra effort but how often can unhappiness or misery just go away on their own?
 
Reaction b requires a lot of mental re-programming and not something that can be achieved overnight. And in the meanwhile, the pain persists. If not effected properly, one can fall into the mode of self-delusion.
 
Reaction c provides for the most immediate change to the situation. Walking the talk is effective and though it causes short-term pain, in the long run there are likely more benefits than drawbacks.

You shouldnt be moving your life savings in and out. 
I usually stay invested between 40 to 80% 
Now i am about 50% invested 50% pure cash, property not inclusive.
And i hold no additinal properties currently. Just a fully paid roof over me and my family's head.

3-4% very common nowadays
Even for small units below $1m
Why u think so many agents can "reinvest" into properties? LOL

CDL chut pattern ....

CDL may turn condos into serviced homesIt is considering move amid thinner profit, rapidly slowing property sectorPublished on Feb 28, 2014By Melissa TanPROPERTY giant City Developments (CDL) says it might consider turning some of its upcoming high-end condominium projects into serviced residences.This drastic move is being contemplated as thinner profits from property development in a rapidly slowing market weighed down the company's earnings released yesterday.CDL executive chairman Kwek Leng Beng also said yesterday that property prices could fall by up to 10 per cent this year.But he added that it depended on the world economy."I used to make a forecast, 10 per cent. It hasn't reached 10 per cent yet... the worst worldwide scenario is over, but we are still facing a lot of uncertainty."CDL group general manager Chia Ngiang Hong told reporters after the briefing that converting some of its unlaunched high-end residential projects into serviced apartments "may be difficult but we won't rule it out... if we have not sold the project yet".Other developers of luxury condos have also contemplated such a conversion recently. Developer OUE was said last year to be planning to convert part of its Twin Peaks condo at Leonie Hill into serviced apartments, though that has not happened.Mr Chia said CDL's Nouvel 18 at Anderson Road, which is still unsold, was on track to be completed by the end of this year.CDL also successfully applied last year to extend the qualifying certificate (QC) construction deadlines for its Gramercy Park condo on the former Lucky Tower site at Grange Road and its New Futura condo on Leonie Hill Road to until the end of next year, he added.He said CDL plans to open the whole South Beach complex by next year, before the project's 2016 completion deadline.Mr Chia said CDL plans to launch a 944-unit condo at Pasir Ris Grove in March or April and then an 845-unit condo at Commonwealth Avenue in the second quarter of this year.Mr Kwek also called on the Government to modify its QC rules this year, saying that these rules were driving up land tender bids."If they will not tweak it or will not do anything about it, we have other plans," he added, but decline to elaborate.Mr Kwek noted that "with QC in place, there is competition for every site... Without any sites, business comes to a standstill. They (developers) have no choice but to bid higher and higher".The QC rules effectively mean developers cannot hold onto sites very long, since a QC gives them up to five years to finish building a project and two more years to sell all the units. They are not allowed to rent out unsold units.Developers whose shareholders and directors are not all Singaporeans have to get a QC to buy residential property for development. This is imposed to control foreign ownership of land here.To ensure compliance, the developer has to put up a banker's guarantee of 10 per cent of the purchase price of the property, which may be forfeited if it fails to fulfil the QC's conditions.Mr Kwek was speaking at CDL's full-year results briefing yesterday, which also happened to be new chief executive Grant Kelley's first at CDL.Mr Kelley, who spoke little yesterday, took the reins on Feb 17 this year.Mr Kwek said CDL chose Mr Kelley because "we can promote from within - we have also third generation, they are very good - but we want to build an international, external wing".The group yesterday posted an 11.4 per cent drop in fourth-quarter net profit to $221 million. Revenue for the three months to Dec 31 dropped 12.6 per cent to $774.4 million from the preceding year.For the full year, net profit inched up 0.7 per cent to $683 million while revenue slipped 5.7 per cent to $3.2 billion.Earnings per share fell 11.6 per cent to 23.6 cents for the quarter from the year before.Net asset value per share was $8.63 as at Dec 31 last year, up from $8.03 as at Dec 31, 2012.CDL proposed an ordinary dividend of eight cents per share.

Give some discount when they say mkt is good
 
likewise, also give some discount when they say they are sweating
 
Now they can still hold their pee back. Bladder & kidneys will only explode in 2015 if things do not move at all

Is it any surprise?
 
But by that does it mean that a field mouse needs bull balls to have baby field mice?

actually if you bought a small unit in geylang and can afford to hold without renting, i would keep it for long term. 
 
maybe pass it on to your children.
 
who knows, when govt decides to revamp and relocate the chicken farm, you will strike jackpot.

Dont worry , my XMM garantee certified AIDs free, those type that can get PRs one , must have degree in love making .
Rental huh , agent tell me can get 3K plus , I supect he double up as a pimp , tell me very easy to get rental one for Geylang . But I dont need to depend on rental to hold the unit , so Ok even at very low rents.  Anyway , put in bank also jialat lah , eat away by inflation .
It is a duo keys , 2 rms unit , upstair 1rm , downstair 1rm + kitchen.  Very flexible on rental lor , can rent one room out , one for own use ,rent 2 seperate tentants or even use as a SOHO for biz.  Sibeh tok kong actually , if not for the shitty market should be quite OK lor. Actually not exactly Geylang , actual address is along Guillimard Road , you wont meet any chicken if walk toward Makota Station.

I think what they purposely forget to mention is that 50% out of the 40% "sold" used to be ex-owners of the development there.  So in the end the hit rate is still on 20%.  For a development with not many units, i dont consider it a runaway success at all...... 
Still left to be since what happens after launch.
 
I estimate at least 30% unsold at the end of the day

Property values 'unlikely to slide in longer term' 
By Cheryl Ong
 
PROPERTY values are unlikely to slide in the longer term, if the Government continues with stable, clear-sighted policies, Law Minister K. Shanmugam has said.
 
"(As) we move into a high-tech economy... we remain a safe centre for banking and financial services... where the Government does not move arbitrarily and acquire for no compensation. The Government doesn't chase people away," he said on Thursday.
 
"If we can keep our policies right, in the longer term, if Singapore was a stock, buy it. And that means property prices will go up," Mr Shanmugam said in response to questions that cooling measures such as the Additional Buyers' Stamp Duty would weigh down property values.
 
He was addressing about 1,700 property agents attending a ministerial dialogue organised by real estate firm PropNex at Kallang Theatre.
 
He also noted in a Facebook post yesterday that he was optimistic about Singapore's future, as the thriving Asean economic community "will offer exciting economic and trade opportunities for us as a regional service hub".
 
Headwinds in the property market, though, in part due to the cooling measures and Total Debt Servicing Ratio, do not mean buyers are unable to afford property, he added at the convention.
 
Instead, some buyers may be wary and are holding back because of fears of a correction in prices.
The Government's redevelopment plans for the Greater Southern Waterfront and Paya Lebar Airbase will also free up "prime superb-value land" and play a part in propping up property values, he said.
 
That means that the role of property agents will grow in importance, as property prices rise.
 
"You are talking about people having to commit millions of dollars, and I think a highly-trained professional who can help people get value for that... can have a tremendous amount of value," Mr Shanmugam said.
 
"I think a lot more advisory work, a lot more analytical-type work and services will have to be started and provided."

developers typically break even at 70% sold. So firesale unlikely if 20-30% is unsold.

Agreed.
Pressure to firesale may note be there.
But pressure to sell at lowered nonetheless will be.
Otherwise, let them all convert to serviced apartments or rent out (if they can) loh!!  
Hohoho

Its like missing the hole by 2cm, 2feet or 2yards or 20yards, still one stroke.
Many land auction nowadays is won by smaller developer and even at high prices.

dont be so excited yet lah. Your logic is correct that mkt is at turning point if only small developers would participate in land tenders and the big boys only go in and bottom fish.
 
a few points in this case:
 
- the winning price is a historic high for yishun. Yishun is hardly considered prime by any stretch of the imagination.
- first prize - EL ($450 psf); second prize FCL ($440 psf 2% lower); third prize CES ($423 psf 6% lower)
- big boys apparently still very hungry to buy at high prices
- if the big boys continue not to win, you don't think they will push their bids further? i'm sure FCL regretted not putting in at $460psf

They are lukewarm and not aggressive in bidding thats for sure.Only the smaller ones who have no choice.
Becos, no land = no inventory = no sales = no business = no future
 
The big boys can win if they wanted to, its whether they deem it worthwhile or not at those prices.
 
I am simply offering a real down to the ground alternative view of why land may still be bought by developers (smallerones) at high prices,  as oppose to stupid agents who cannot decipher the information further than their frontdoor mat.
Haha true cos now got one additional property, by value my networth increase though haha
By networth, not necessarily.
Becos value drop, loan still there.
 
Heh heh heh 
 
Be careful now.....if we are talking valuation.....thats different from liquidity.

Refinancing that home loan on many a to-do list, New launch Condo
 
The Government last month also made it easier for many home owners to refinance their home loans by widening exemptions from its total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) requirements.
Still, experts say that borrowers should do their sums and assess all available options before picking a new loan package.

Singapore
A FOUR-BEDROOM apartment in the prime Draycott 8 project has been put up for sheriff's auction on March 27. JLL, which is conducting the auction, is also separately marketing by private treaty four condo units in Sentosa Cove that have been put up for sale by their mortgagees (or lenders).
Private treaty deals entail negotiations unlike an auction where all the bidders come publicly.
Two of the apartments are in the Turquoise project; they are four-bedroom units, one above the other and believed to be owned by the same party.
The other two apartments - a three-bedder and a four-bedder - are in the Marina Collection condo.
Mok Sze Sze, head of auction and sales at JLL, said there has been a rise in the number of private homes being put up for auction by mortgagees or lenders. In the first two months of this year, there were five such properties, compared with only two in the same period last year.
Typically, financial institutions tend to provide some leeway to borrowers who are experiencing difficulty servicing their mortgages by giving them an opportunity to dispose of their properties themselves. "But lately it has been more difficult for owners to sell their properties as they tend to hold on to their prices. Buyers, on the other hand, have been finding it harder to obtain credit since the TDSR (total debt servicing ratio) was introduced last June," said Ms Mok.
This has resulted in a price gap, causing more properties to end up as mortgagee sales, she added.
Colliers International deputy managing director Grace Ng says the same argument would apply to non-residential properties since TDSR cuts across all property sectors. "In fact, since last year, we have seen more industrial properties being put up for sale by lenders because SMEs have been experiencing a challenging business environment.
"As for commercial properties, the trend of mortgagee sales is not yet pronounced but I expect more such cases this year."
At Turquoise, a guide price of $5.5 million to $5.8 million has been set for each of the two four-bedroom units, reflecting $1,981-$2,089 per square foot (psf) for the 2,777-sq-ft apartments - on the second and third levels.
The highest transaction in the development was $2,772 psf in October 2007, said Ms Mok citing caveats data from SISV Realink.
Over at Marina Collection, JLL is marketing a three-bedroom apartment of 2,098 sq ft on the first level and a 2,185-sq-ft four-bedder on the third level.
"The asking price for each unit is $6 million, which works out to $2,860 psf for the three-bedder and $2,746 psf for the four-bedder," said Ms Mok.
The highest price achieved in the condo is $2,950 psf between the November 2012 and March 2013 period. Generally, Marina Collection units have been transacting at higher prices as they enjoy a better facing, added Ms Mok.
According to a recent study by Colliers, the median price of condo transactions in Sentosa Cove shot up from $847 psf in Q4 2004 to $1,576 psf in Q4 2006, touching a high of $2,658 psf in Q1 2008. The global crisis took the wind out of the luxury condo market's sails and Sentosa Cove was no exception.
Within just nine months, the median price of condos in the upscale waterfront housing district had tumbled to $1,200 psf in Q4 2008. Following that, prices have been on a rocky road to recovery. The median Sentosa Cove condo price touched a record high of $2,950 psf in Q1 2013. But with the release of the TDSR framework a few months later, this eased to $1,895 psf by end-December 2013.
Meanwhile, those keen on a property in Singapore's traditional prime districts may want to head to JLL's auction on March 27, which starts at 2.30pm at The Amara Hotel. The star property is the sheriff's auction of the four-bedroom unit on the 13th level of Draycott 8. The unit faces the clubhouse and greenery, said Ms Mok. Completed about nine years ago, Draycott 8 is on a site with a balance lease term of about 82 years.
The indicative price for the unit is $6-6.5 million, which reflects about $2,096-$2,270 psf based on the unit's strata area of 2,863 sq ft. JLL said that about a year ago, comparable units in the development fetched around $7 million or $2,445 psf.
The sheriff's sale is being conducted to recover debt owed to an individual creditor.

may i ask, for private, i thought usually tenants do not need to pay agent fee?
usually is tenant's agent will co-broke with landlord's agent for the landlord's commission right?

	New home sales surge 28% in Feb	But March figures likely to be subdued, say experts

The Straits Times - March 18, 2014 By: Cheryl Ong

NEW home sales here kept picking up pace last month, as developers returned to the market with major new suburban launches.
But experts expect this month's figures to be subdued, and estimate that total sales for the first quarter will still be about 30 per cent lower than that for the fourth quarter last year.
They said February's upswing might reflect a stabilising market, but that a rebound in buying demand would still largely depend on how developers price units.
Home hunters bought 724 units last month, a 28 per cent surge from the 565 units sold in January, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority showed yesterday. This excludes sales at executive condominiums.
The upswing was driven by two launches in Sengkang West, where 550 units went on sale. This helped the suburbs record 588 sales, leading the overall tally.
"With the market more attuned to the raft of cooling measures and financing curbs, as well as the festive lull behind, developers released two new mass-market projects in the suburbs," said Ms Chia Siew Chuin, director of research and advisory at Colliers International.
Frasers Centrepoint's 495-unit Rivertrees Residences moved 218 units at a median $1,111 per sq ft (psf), while UOL Group's 555-unit Riverbank @ Fernvale sold 211 units at a median $1,033 psf.
"Despite being (in) strong competition to each other, both adopted competitive pricing strategies," said Dr Chua Yang Liang, head of research and consultancy, South-east Asia, at property firm Jones Lang LaSalle. "The conditions today require developers to be more sensitive to the market, where value for money is key."
On the city fringes, 87 units were sold, while 49 units were moved in the city centre.
Experts said projects launched earlier felt the pressure from new launches, as developers slashed prices at older developments.
Property agency OrangeTee's research head Christine Li pointed to 10 per cent price cuts at MCL Land's Hallmark Residences in Bukit Timah, where 26 units were sold for a median price of $1,860 psf last month. "February's sales of Hallmark Residences could be a silver lining in the market: As long as developers can forgo some margins, but still be profitable, buyers do come back," she said.
Buyers picked up 23 units at EL Development's La Fiesta in Sengkang and 22 units at Fragrance Group and World Class Land's Urban Vista in Tanah Merah.
CBRE research head Desmond Sim said prices are "relatively stable" despite minor corrections of 1 per cent to 3 per cent at older projects. He said the discounts may have been for "less saleable units at older launches".
Still, Mr Sim said March sales figures are not likely to be strong. He expects sales this month to come in at between 400 and 500 units due to a dearth of new launches, and first-quarter sales to hit 1,800 units, 30 per cent below that sold in the preceding three months.
"The future new home sales market will very much be dependent on how developers want to move sales in a quieter market," said Ms Li.
But developers are also waiting to see who makes the first move, said Mr Sim, adding: "It is also a matter of who blinks first... Developers don't want to cannibalise each other too."

Hearing some buzz that the upcoming lakeside condo project will be launched at $1,300-$1,500 psf.
 
If they can move these units, then dont be surprised to see price index actually going up!

most of the time property lags behind stocks by 6 mths
 
the STI is so resilient, after all the news abt tapering, china defaulting, russia invading crimea etc still holding firm at 3,000 - 3,100
 
I think we have to see STI hitting 2,500 - 2,700 before sentiments can get low enough to affect property
 
otherwise expect mass market property price to remain flat. maybe at most drop 5%. Not even enough to compensate for ABSD.

Reports keep showing, no. of units which doesnt tell much.
 
Quantum $500-700k is one unit
Quantum $1.5mil to $3mil is also one unit.

Yah, the floor, i think he nitpick, but the plastering , the sliding door lock etc, cannot pass for sure. 
Older condos are more solid for sure.
Nowadays even the high end ones which i hv seen are ok only.
Sigh......what to do.....
Even older watches are more collectable.
Things are not made they used to already.
People are also not......

"Mr Tan B K, 48, who bought a penthouse unit for S$1.15 million, said “the standard is definitely not up to the mark”. He claimed that he found more than 500 defects, including a gas pipe that is not connected to the stove. He gave up trying to label all the defects, which he photographed and compiled for the developer. “It is completely unacceptable. If there are more than 10 flaws, it is not a defect anymore, it’s a workmanship issue,” he added."

This is The Canopy.
Along yishun avenue 11. 
It's not close to MRT. But it's beside a neighbourhood center. NTUC, 3-4 coffeeshops.

even he upgrade from selling a $650k hdb (assuming fully paid liao at age 48), still need to take a loan of $500K
but if sell bishan $1M hdb ... good la

Some times it is not about your own convenience, but the convenience of other members in the family who don't drive. I would like to stay near MRT if possible so that my kids can have easy access to PT. They don't have to transfer from MRT to bus or having to walk 20 mins home from station.
 
Unless you are so rich that every members in the family have their own cars, yah then I agree, stay somewhere like what T2 said, atas and privacy.

you are absolutely right, else $1M-$1.25M condo near MRT will not move like hot cakes
in today market,
$300k-$450k hdb is entry level
$1M condo is entry level > if private condo, can only get you 2B or 3B (sibei compact) 750sqft to 850sqft nia
if you go showroom ... agent ask you what is your budget ... you said $1M ... agent will tell you your options are only MM (invest) or 2B (live in)  factoring ABSD, etc

stickers no enough for 500 defects ... lol
 
"Mr Tan B K, 48, who bought a penthouse unit for S$1.15 million, said “the standard is definitely not up to the mark”. He claimed that he found more than 500 defects, including a gas pipe that is not connected to the stove. He gave up trying to label all the defects, which he photographed and compiled for the developer. “It is completely unacceptable. If there are more than 10 flaws, it is not a defect anymore, it’s a workmanship issue,” he added."
 
 
 

 
seriously, a lot of buyers are delusional that they are entitled to good worksmanship just because they paid over a million
 
Pls check what is the proportion of price paid for the land
 
In fact, developers have less budget for construction these days compared to 10 yrs ago when condos were selling for just $600 psf.

Million dollar EC penthouse very dai sai???
 
There are a lot of other developments where it has been amply proven that proximity to MRT matters even when the condo goes for way above 1 million.
 
MRT still comes into consideration because the target group are not your GCB type or 1 rung below GCB types.

Prices dip for housing units at uncompleted projectsPublished on Mar 19, 2014By Melissa TanSELLING prices at some uncompleted projects have fallen over the past three months - by anything from just over 1 per cent to 7 per cent - possibly as developers aim to clear units that have been on the market for some time.Urban Vista in Tanah Merah, The Glades nearby and D'Leedon have all recorded declines in their median prices from December to last month, Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) figures show.Consultants said developers could be facing pressure to give discounts due to stiff competition from newer launches. "But most of the projects will still try to maintain prices as much as possible," R'ST Research director Ong Kah Seng said.OrangeTee research head Christine Li noted that a median price drop does not necessarily mean that developers reduced prices for the whole project.Analysts added that it could also mean developers sold more bigger units, which draw lower prices on a per square foot (psf) basis, than in previous months.The URA private property price index could still hold steady in the first quarter or even rise slightly from the preceding quarter, Ms Li added.At Urban Vista in Tanah Merah Kechil Link, waiting two months could save a buyer over $50,000. For instance, an 850 sq ft unit sold for $1,131,953 on Dec 3, but a similar unit on a higher floor in the same block sold for $1,080,000 on Feb 27, according to caveats lodged with the URA.The median price for new sales at the project slid from $1,345 psf in December to $1,291 psf in January, down 4 per cent.The project by Fragrance Group and World Class Land sold eight units in December and seven in January. The median price sank a further 2.4 per cent to $1,259 psf in February, a month when 22 homes were sold. This brought the cumulative sales to 554 out of 582 units at the end of last month - a take-up rate of 95 per cent.Many more units are unsold across the road at Keppel Land's The Glades. The 726-unit project in Bedok Rise, launched in September last year, had moved 140 units by the end of last month.The median price for new home sales at the project declined by 6.2 per cent from $1,477 psf in December to $1,385 psf in January. It slipped another 1.7 per cent to $1,362 psf in February, while notching up 14 sales that month.Prices at The Glades are slightly higher than those at Urban Vista, partly because its developer paid more for the land.CapitaLand's D'Leedon also saw median prices fall by 7.4 per cent for new sales, from $1,512 psf in December to $1,400 psf in January. There was a further dip of 1 per cent to $1,386 psf last month.The project at Leedon Heights moved between two and five units in each of those three months. It had sold 1,442 of its 1,715 units by the end of last month.melissat@sph.com.sg

I would like to disagree. Every buyer of a property, regardless of how much he has paid for it, deserves good worksmanship if it was promised as part of the package. 
 
Should the seller not be able to deliver good worksmanship if it was part of the package at the point of purchase, it is simply misrepresentation and he should be answerable to the buyer for that shortfall in delivery.
 

 
seriously, a lot of buyers are delusional that they are entitled to good worksmanship just because they paid over a million

yes, every buyer is entitled to good worksmanship
 
my comment was in jest/ sarcasm
 
from experience hearing from buyers that the quality of finishing (not worksmanship) is so crappy given that they are paying millions of dollars. Eg Sail @ Marina in the past, and nowadays suburban or even prime condos
 
Not to say all china developers proj are lousy (natura loft was quite good), but i would also lower my expectation and also price expectation when buying from a china firm

tanah merah $1,300 psf.. who'd have thought? Just a few years ago, we'd underwritten a bid for GLS there based on $800 psf selling, thinking that we were already stretched to almost the max LOL
 
Yeah, heard that jurong launch is super hot. over 2,000 groups of interested people viewed the showflat over the weekend.
 
Wonder how many cheques were collected?
 
could be another fish market on preview day where people end up in tears for not getting a unit LOL

mass market pricing is $1.5M and below ... affordably-priced 
 
how much to lowball for auction property? any tips? hehe
 

Auction property sales to fall 24% to $80m this year
 
Buyers to remain cautious.
 
According to Colliers International, considering the current inertia in the property market, it is expected that the number of properties put up for mortgagee sale will continue to increase, particularly in the high-end residential and retail sectors. Ms Grace Ng (黄黎明), Deputy Managing Director of Colliers International, said “Affordability will still be the main concern among buyers. Buyers will continue to look for affordably-priced properties such as those below S$1.5 million.
 
Although buyers are expected to remain cautious – in light of the impending interest rates increase and the potential upcoming supply, which will put pressure on prices – sales activity is expected to pick up over the next two quarters, as both buyers and sellers gradually adjust their expectations to work towards market equilibrium.”
 
She concludes, “The total sale value for the Singapore auction property market is expected to come in at between S$70 million and S$80 million for the whole of 2014, a decrease of some 13-24 per cent from the total sales value in 2013.”

Property buyers sued over 'lost opportunity' costs
 
CONDOMINIUM developer is suing an "obstinate" man and his wife for more than $760,000, claiming they built two unauthorised timber lofts in their penthouse apartment.Developer Macly Assets alleges that Mr and Mrs Andrew Loke are to blame for the delay in it obtaining the certificate of statutory completion from the Building and Construction Authority (BCA).Macly alleges that the certificate for the Thomson V Two project at Sin Ming Road was meant to have been issued in March last year but it was only granted last November because of the couple's unauthorised renovation.This meant that a $5 million sum, paid by the flat buyers and held in a stakeholding account, was tied up longer than it should have been when it could have been used for other purposes.Macly is trying to claim $760,782.96 in "lost opportunity" costs from the couple in a three-day High Court hearing that started yesterday.Mr Loke, 42, a chief financial officer, and his 37-year- old teacher wife bought the 60 sq m apartment in 2007 for $600,000, before it was built.They started renovating the unit after the temporary occupation permit for the development was issued in June 2012.Mr Loke got his contractors to build two 7 sq m lofts, one above the hall and the other over the bedroom.In January last year, BCA officers visiting the couple's unit to check other defects chanced upon the lofts and told Mr Loke that the structures did not comply with regulations.Two months later, BCA said it would withhold issuing the certificate for the property until several "deviations" were fixed.Macly asserts it had fixed the other items cited by the BCA but the Lokes were uncooperative in removing the lofts.In May, BCA ordered them to be demolished. Mr Loke then changed the timber decks to softboard materials to make the structure non-load-bearing and the BCA lifted the order in September.Macly's lawyer, Mr N. Kanagavijayan, said in his opening statement yesterday that the lofts were built without the developer's permission, breaching the sale and purchase agreement that the couple signed.But the Lokes, represented by Mr Mahmood Gaznavi, said Macly and its managing agent were aware that the renovations included the timber decks and did not object to them.The couple also pointed out that other owners in the condo had built similar loft structures in their units.

Just a few years back, consultants are saying that developers have to keep mass market below $1.2m to move. Otherwise no buyer will bite with all the cooling measures
 
now it is $1.5m?
 
looks like middle income grp upgraders are able to stretch their budget further and further

Developers crank up marketing machine
Seminars at showflats, multiple agencies among tools used as launch sales dry up

LYNETTE KHOO
lynkhoo@sph.com.sg

Some developers engage multiple marketing agencies for one project, offer higher commission to agencies for specific projects and discounts to buyers for a limited period - PHOTO: SPH

 

 


More developers may promise the 'first-year rental guarantee' to buyers because of increased new completions.- Ong Kah Seng, director of R'ST Research



Downward trend


[sINGAPORE] In yet another sign of tepid private residential sales, the proportion of projects that managed to move more than half of their units in the month of their launch has declined significantly last year.
This has prompted developers and their marketing agencies to deploy more marketing tools to draw more potential buyers to their showflats.
Some developers engage multiple marketing agencies for one project, offer higher commission to agencies for specific projects and discounts to buyers for a limited period. Property agencies have also turned to their favourite tool - holding seminars at show flats to draw in the crowds.
Data collated by OrangeTee Research shows that the proportion of projects with more than half of their total available units sold in the month of launch fell to 21 per cent in 2013, down from 31 per cent in 2012 and below the 27 per cent level seen in the 2009 recession year.
The month of launch is typically crucial for developers to move their units quickly as interest for new launches tend to wear off after the initial weeks of the launch. The subscription rate takes into account the total number of units in each project as developers will roll out more units for sale when there is demand for it.
Going by this measure, 2010 remained a banner year for the private property sector, where 50 per cent of projects launched that year sold more than half of their total available units.
Property consultants believe that the downward trend will continue this year. This is leaving developers scratching for more ideas to entice buyers besides the current price discounts and rebates offered.
"The main factor driving this decline is that the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework and the additional buyers stamp duty (ABSD) is reducing investment demand. Even an HDB upgrader with an outstanding mortgage on his existing flat, who wants to buy a condo unit for his own use, will have his available loan for the condo unit reduced by the TDSR framework," said SLP International executive director Nicholas Mak.
"Under pressure to push sales, some agents may direct clients towards potential projects that pay highest commission or have the best chance of closing the deal, swinging buyers from one project to another because the agents' loyalty is to themselves," he said.
Ong Kah Seng, director of R'ST Research, noted that the restriction of having no shoebox units in Outside Central areas in 2013 also affected the pace of sales in the first month of launch, as shoebox apartments were quickly snapped up in previous years. He predicts that more developers may promise the 'first-year rental guarantee' to buyers because of increased new residential completions in the years ahead.
The slower market pace has already prompted some developers to appoint multiple marketing agents in the hope of pushing sales more quickly.
For The Santorini project in Tampines launched by MCC Land over the weekend, the developer has engaged four marketing agencies that include two of Singapore's largest agencies PropNex and ERA Realty, as well as GPS Alliance and CBRE Singapore.
"Under the current market conditions, working with multiple marketing agencies would help cast a wider net in reaching out to more prospective buyers," a MCC spokesman told BT, adding that this does not translate to higher costs for the developer as fees to marketing agencies is paid upon sales.
It is not common to see four agencies joining forces or having two large agencies for one single project, said Christine Li, head of research at Orangetee. PropNex and ERA each have over 5,000 agents in Singapore.
For Singapore Land's prime 106-unit project Pollen & Bleu at Farrer Drive, the developer has appointed three agencies - Huttons, Savills and CBRE.
Property consultants note that for projects with multiple marketing agencies, it is unclear if each agency would give its fullest commitment. It also requires greater coordination between the developer and its marketing agents.
"There is a point of diminishing returns," one industry veteran noted.
City Developments Limited (CDL) has added two more marketing agents - OrangeTee and SLP Realty - early this year to market its project Jewel @ Buangkok with Huttons. The 616-unit development has so far sold 401 units since its launch in June last year.
Just over a week ago, a parenting seminar was held at the project's showflat with an invited speaker from Touch Family Services. Huttons is soon holding a property seminar at the showflat this Saturday, where the agency's director of business and research, Bernard Lee, will talk about the potential impact of URA draft master plan 2013 on property supply and demand.
CDL spokeswoman said that events held for Jewel@Buangkok and other launches "have been planned with a view towards enriching potential homebuyers' knowledge of and exposure to topics of interest such as property update seminars by industry experts and talks on fengshui".
"Some events such as parenting talks and children's enrichment activities were also organised to coincide with festive celebrations such as Mid-Autumn and school holidays, as a form of outreach and engagement with our customers and their families," she said.
SLP International's Mr Mak will be speaking on URA's master plan for Woodlands at Twin Fountains, an executive condominium project by Frasers Centrepoint. ERA and SLP are the marketing agents for this project.
Elson Poo, general manager for sales and marketing at Frasers Centrepoint Homes, said the talk is meant to "educate people who are not familiar with Woodlands to see the potential of living in Woodlands and hopefully to drive some sales".

 

 
 
Sales at The Santorini disappoint
Only 80 of the 200 units released at the 597-unit condo's weekend launch sold

The Santorini: The units sold at the 'Mediterranean-inspired' Tampines condominium are mostly one and two-bedders, says MCC Land. - FILE PHOTO

 

 


 
 
OF the 200 units released at The Santorini's launch over the weekend, only 80, or 40 per cent, have been sold, leading analysts to suggest that the market is tiring of too much supply of similar mass-market projects, particularly ones with low-quantum compact units.
The units sold at the "Mediterranean-inspired" Tampines condominium were mostly one and two-bedroom units, a spokesman for developer MCC Land (Singapore) Pte Ltd told BT. This was expected, since over half of the condominium's 597 units are one and two-bedders.
Compact units have become the rage since the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) framework rolled out last June lowered the loan-to-value limits for buyers who have an existing home mortgage and are still looking to buy more residential properties.
Buyers have therefore had to scale down their sights to lower-quantum investment property purchases.
"For most middle-class buyers, this is all they can afford as a second property. The TDSR framework has restricted the liquidity in the market," said SLP International research head Nicholas Mak.
Prices at The Santorini start from $508,200 for the smallest unit, a 463-sq-ft one-bedder.
From the developer's point of view, selling units at "small quantum with higher-dollar per square foot prices" will also help it to break even more easily, given the high price at which it bid the land for - at $562.01 per square foot per plot ratio - for a plot not walking distance to the MRT station and in an area with quite a lot of new supply, Century 21 chief executive Ku Swee Yong said.
He estimates that more than 25,000 units will come onstream in the Punggol, Sengkang, Tampines and Pasir Ris area in the next three to four years.
Price at The Santorini's units average $1,100 per sq ft, slightly higher than the nearby Waterview and Q Bay Residences condominiums.
Looking ahead, most consultants believe that the appetite for one and two-bedders will dwindle.
Mr Ku said: "It will be tougher to find additional new sources of buyers even at the $500,000 mark. This segment of mass market buyers buying at low quantum may have been exhausted already."
He added that compact investment units are also untested in terms of rentals. Referring to The Santorini development, he said: "How many people will be looking to rent a one-bedroom of about 500 sq ft? What sort of rents can you get? Would a renter rather take a three-room HDB flat that he can share with a colleague for $2,000 a month, or pay for a much smaller room with more facilities? It's a bit of a struggle."
But Chesterton Singapore managing director Donald Han thought otherwise. He sees the trend of developers releasing and buyers snapping up low-quantum small units continuing.
"The sweet spot is really $800,000 and below - which is what one- and two-bedroom units are targeting at," he said. "The fact that The Santorini can sell 80 units is deemed a fairly good number to achieve in a slowing market."

Bro, you are also right la.  
the agents marketing to foreigner is buy SG property must pay 18% stamp duty.. The ones haven't buy before wouldn't feel the pinch and psychologically felt its norm. It's the loan application part that is hindering the process.
 
For local buyer, asking to fork out additional 10% for a 1.5mil property, is like paying government a free car.. So most wouldn't buy unless the 1.5mil property is now 1.2m n lower.. A lot of local resident got hundreds of K or many millions sitting in bank account.. Of course those committed to 3 property and above are now maxed out on debt servicing ratio are out of the game currently.. 
 
If u put yourself in the shoes that u have 1mil in your bank account now and u have 2 properties under your belt, and the 3rd property your income can support TDSR as only take 40% loan! but u have to pay additional stamp duty of 10%... Sure sibei buay song to pay even if can afford.

You must have catched a falling parang in your properties investment portfolios, please re-calculate break-even point level and execute a minor cutting lost strategy.
I'm not frightening you now, the days of 1997 property crisis is hovering in my imaginations due to the facts of earlier immigrants are packing up for retreat movements, I'm closely watching the local construction sector labour managements.

Yah cos i was affected badly by ABSD Already thanks for having second property. 
 
However my LTV about 40% and i think even if another 1997 come i would be able to hold as long as ur property value dont drop below ur loan amount. 
 
Now i need to hold my property until price hit higher another few years with the 6.9m population and redevelopment along pasir panjang

Few months installment -- you're playing with fire bro. Your mindset is one of a speculator. I can tell from the way you calculate till zun zun and expect to sell for profit in a few years.
 
A true property investor can hold for at least 2 years (24mths).

Just came back.

Home prices continue slide as loan curbs bite THE housing market downturn worsened in the first quarter of the year as loan curbs bit deeper and a possible oversupply of new homes loomed larger.
Private home prices fell 1.3 per cent in the January to March period from the three months before, according to Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) flash estimates out yesterday
developers are holding back new launches and are trying to clear previous projects
Analysts said yesterday that prices would likely continue to soften and could fall by 5 to 8 per cent over the course of this year.
Given market weakness and a potential oversupply of completed homes, some have called for some property curbs to be modified.

5 to 8% only?
Thats nothing lah.....

Cash buffer -- only cold hard cash counts during hard times because nobody would buy anything then. Take for example, your car worth 80k now doesn't mean it would be worth as much during a recession. Asset rich ppl are only just for that moment (just like most Singaporeans -- richest country in the world eh).

Before the recession in 1997, many ppl who are asset rich thought they could have all their assets to depend upon (car, house, gold, stocks) but it all vanished in a moment and they couldn't liquidify any without making huge losses. Minimum cash buffer I would keep is 20% of my portfolio but that's just me. You got to keep at least 2 years (installment + expenses) to be safe.

What else can the property agents marketing this area harp on?
That it is freaking far from airport?
That it is as vibrant as a new factory?
That much better central areas can be had for the same price?
 
That said, i dont deny that there will be a fair stable demand of units at jurong.
Its the price i find overvalued.  So i am more than willing to let other people make this money.

Lately with watches , destiny hasnt been with me, although in stock markets, it has.
 
When i got back from HK two weeks ago, should hv already bought the diamond dial Daytona full gold but didnt.  Then before i left for Europe last week, should have got a seadweller but didnt close.
Perhaps this weekend, it may happen.  But even not, i will just hang around and wait.  No rush

Right now there isnt a new watch or model that attracts me.
The last one that really did (gmt master 2 full gold,  i bought already.

huat ah .... anyway, i wouldn't say "unexpected" for unit < $1M
400 cheques received for balloting ... i wonder why not more than 180 units were sold
assuming 40% x 695 units were 1-2 bed units = 278 units
the remaining 1-2 bed units will be priced higher today? 
 

Jurong condo sales better than expected180 Lakeville units sold; project in Commonwealth also unveiledBy Rennie WhangBUYERS flocked to get a piece of the action at a new Jurong condominium while an upcoming project in Commonwealth Avenue was unveiled on a busy day for property yesterday.Much of the buzz was at the preview of MCL Land's Lakeville condominium in Jurong West Street 41, but Hong Leong Holdings grabbed some of the spotlight as well with its announcement.The balloting tent for the 695-unit Lakeville, which comprises six 16-storey blocks, was filled with more than 150 buyers and 50 agents yesterday.MCL Land chief executive Koh Teck Chuan said the firm had initially released 150 units but released a further 50 as sales were better than expected.In all, 180 units were sold at $1,300 per sq ft (psf), with most of the buyers Singaporean. About two-thirds of the units sold were one- and two-bedders.Prices range from $736,000 for a 560 sq ft one-bedder, to $2.67 million for a 2,271 sq ft four-bedroom penthouse.Mr Koh noted that 400 cheques were balloted yesterday, adding: "Considering the market, we are very happy with the turnout."The last condominium launch in the area was J Gateway last July, also developed by MCL Land. Most of its 738 units sold in one day at an average of $1,480 psf.The low number of residential projects in the area compared with Sengkang and Punggol has led to much pent-up demand, said Mr Donald Han, managing director of Chesterton Singapore.He added that Lakeville's $1,300 psf price tag reflected weak market sentiment.The Urban Redevelopment Authority said on Tuesday that private home prices dipped 1.3 per cent in the first quarter from the fourth quarter last year."It could be launched at more than $1,300 per sq ft. But because of general market sentiment, developers would rather play safe and launch at a lower price," said Mr Han.He noted that MCL Land seems to have "cornered the market fairly well, they understand the market in the area... We should see a good first phase launch."Century 21 chief executive Ku Swee Yong said that Jurong is "definitely up and coming". "With two new hospitals and hospital-related jobs paying better than average salaries, as well as new office buildings, the level of wealth within Jurong should go up."He added that having the Canadian International School next door would mean expatriate families could be keen to rent at Lakeville, which should be completed in mid-2017.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Meanwhile, Hong Leong Holdings unveiled Commonwealth Towers, a 99-year leasehold condo in Commonwealth Avenue.It is undertaking the development, which will be launched in May, with City Developments (CDL) and Hong Realty.The condominium, comprising two blocks of 43 storeys each, will be linked to Queenstown MRT station by an overhead pedestrian linkway. It will have 845 units, mostly one- and two-bedders, with sizes starting at 441 sq ft. Show suites will be open for public preview from April 13 to 27, with building work expected to be completed in December 2017.The Commonwealth Avenue area has seen a few launches over the past two years, most recently Alex Residences at Alexandra Road, which sold 150 out of 429 units at an average of $1,650 psf on its first day of sales in November.Echelon in Alexandra View, also developed by CDL, sold 390 of 508 units at an average of $1,700 psf in its first weekend of sales in January last year. It is now 99 per cent sold, with just three penthouses left.Mr Edwin Wee, head of sales at SLP International, said Commonwealth Towers should do well given Hong Leong Group bought the land at a low $880 psf."When developers buy cheaply, they can sell cheaply. With competitive prices for the area at about $1,500 per sq ft, Hong Leong may price at $1,300 or $1,400 per sq ft and still move units."Additional reporting by Ivan Teo

Hhhmmmm even the HDB upgraders are thinning out.  Foreigners are almost totally out.  One to two roomers? Well done.  $600k to $800k type? Well done.
 
This is excellent news and serves to prove me right.  It will take a few new launches to absorb the leftover market and then we shall see some serious friction forming.
 
this MM segment does not impact me prsonally at all, i am just concerned for my fellow Singaporeans.

Problem is they only hv 400 checks for MM units and they hv already released all.  
The market can hardly absorb anything above $2mil.
So the "players" will continue to develop small ones to stay afloat
 
But let me share a perspective, sell $3mil unit do same work as sell $1mil unit but now no one wants to buy $3mil unit and the $1mil unit buyers are thinning out slowly and surely.
 
You say how leh?  
 
One thing is for sure, no developer or agent will dare speak the truth of their own market.
And we know why dont we?

seller stamp duty!
can i assume condo that TOP between 2010 to 2014 were probably purchased before feb 2010 and will not be subjected to SSD?
 

In February 2010, the Government imposed a seller’s stamp duty (SSD) on sellers who buy (or acquire) residential properties on or after 20 February 2010 and sell (or disposed of) them within one year of acquisition.
The amount of SSD is computed based on the same rates as the buyer's stamp duty. 
On 30 Aug 2010, the Government further announced that SSD will be payable on residential properties which are acquired (or purchased) on or after 30 Aug 2010 and disposed of (or sold) within 3 years of acquisition. The amount of SSD for the holding period of 1 year is computed based on the same rates as the buyer's stamp duty, but will be reduced  to 2/3 and 1/3 of the amount of buyer's stamp duty for holding period of 2 years and 3 years respectively.
On 13 January 2011, the Government announced the extension of the holding period for imposition of SSD on residential properties from 3 years to 4 years based on new rates. The new SSD rates will be imposed on residential properties which are acquired (or purchased) on or after 14 January 2011 and disposed of (or sold) within 4 years of acquisition, as follows :
Holding period of 1 year : 16% of price or market value, whichever is higher
Holding period of 2 years : 12% of price or market value, whichever is higher
Holding period of 3 years : 8% of price or market value, whichever is higher
Holding period of 4 years : 4% of price or market value, whichever is higher
Properties acquired before 20 Feb 2010 will not be subject to SSD.

Will Sky Habitat price cut nudge others?
CapitaLand will relaunch the Bishan project priced from $1,370 psf

AMID mounting pressure from upcoming condominium launches, at least one condo project will be re-launched at lower prices. CapitaLand's Bishan project Sky Habitat will start at $1,370 per square foot (psf) on April 19, says a promotional pamphlet from one of its marketing agents, Knight Frank.
This is a drop from two years ago, at the project's first launch, when prices ranged from $1,435 to $1,893 psf. The average selling price then was said to be about $1,650 psf, after taking into account the initial 3 per cent discount given to all buyers. It was what gave this development designed by Moshe Safdie the reputation of being the most expensive suburban condo here.
Only 36 per cent of its 509 units have been sold, as the project nears TOP (temporary occupation permit) next year. With the re-launch, a one-bedroom cum study could start from $1.05 million or $1,485 psf, down from about $1,600 psf previously.
This is not the first time CapitaLand has pared prices for its residential projects; it did so for Interlace in Alexandra and D'Leedon in the former Farrer Court Estate. Its latest move has, however, set observers thinking about whether others will follow suit.
SLP International executive director Nicholas Mak said that the repricing reflects the "new market reality", as developers anticipate new competing launches soon. "If it does not do something to increase sales or the rate of sales, it will end up getting stuck with unsold units as the project nears completion."
But Christine Li, head of research and consultancy at OrangeTee, believes that drastic price cuts are unlikely. "Developers have made enough profits in the last few years and so are in no hurry to do so."
Prices are more likely to be cut for high-end projects because of waning demand, but mass-market projects should hold up well, she added.
Other analysts said that larger developers have more holding power for unsold inventory than smaller developers, so the fact that CapitaLand is among the first to re-launch a project at tamped-down prices comes as a surprise. CapitaLand is developing Sky Habitat with Mitsubishi Estate Asia and Shimizu Investment (Asia).
DBS Group Research analyst Lock Mun Yee said that it was unlikely that CapitaLand would need to do any write-downs on the project, though margins could be affected if the average selling price falls. Her estimated breakeven price for the project was in the "low $1,300s". "They've already locked in a portion at higher prices, so they don't need to take the drastic action of writing it down. Asset turnover is also an important consideration. You don't want to sit on inventory."
Mr Mak said that the repricing is not an issue of holding power, but is in line with the "conveyor belt" strategy to move sales in both good times and bad, which tends to pay off in the long run.
Sky Vue, CapitaLand's adjacent project, has sold close to 70 per cent of its 694 units since its launch last September; its 2013 average price was $1,500 psf and its median price in February was $1,457 psf.

STI still lingering at 3200
 
Until it reaches level of 2600-2800, dont bother about hoping to see any significant price correction. By which i mean 15-20% reduction.
 
Those who are thinking of exiting now still not too late.. still got time to get out

So isnt it a 20% drop already for this project?
No surprises, more to come.
 
Yes they have to move sales, or they die.
Its just as simple as that.
Even if you open convenience store, you do the same thing.
"YOU DONT WANT TO SIT ON INVENTORY"
 
Yup, they got it right.
Sky Habitat only sold 36%, after so much hype? Does not compute.
This project is farked if they dont move fast.
 
I would think it will eventually drop to $1200psf

those who have bought earlier that were 20% more expensive will lppl suck thumb? no recourse for them?
lose 200k for every 1 million is no joke..  
Yup suck thumb lor.  Wooohooooo!  Just as if the price goes up 20%, can the developer have recourse?
Deal done means done deal.

1200psf sell below cost? 
 
So desperate... 
 
Well they can follow the Chinese example ie band together to protest at the sales office if got guts
Must see if they can sell or not, if not, then below cost also let go.When you run a business you will understand.
Small profit better than no profit.
No profit better then small loss
Small loss better than big loss.
 
 
Protest! Muayhahahahahahahaha, get haul up for unlawful assembly, good luck!

The lowest psf was $1416, so effectively only 3.3% drop le. 
 
But if compare the highest psf $1893, then it is a whopping 27.6%.

So isnt it a 20% drop already for this project?
No surprises, more to come.
 
Yes they have to move sales, or they die.
Its just as simple as that.
Even if you open convenience store, you do the same thing.
"YOU DONT WANT TO SIT ON INVENTORY"
 
Yup, they got it right.
 
This project is farked if they dont move fast.
 
I would think it will eventually drop to $1200psf

I once rented out a 3 bedroom, 1,238 sq ft unit in Novena area (but on Newton road and has the word Newton in the name) for $8k a month for 2 years.
 
Not sure how much the new owner rented it out for after I sold it to him when the 2 year lease came to an end..

yup fear cause price to go up, fear of more measures to restrict buying multiple units n cannot afford next time also caused price to go up.
 
but now that cooling measures stopped appearing liao, theres no more scare of future measures pushing buyers to commit first.
 
is same as stock mkt, they both climb walls of worry. once the worry is gone, then is time for the bear to appear

When times are good, you build up cash reserves.When times are bad, you go in and buy.
Now where got high possibility of losing job?
So now is good for building cash reserves.
By the time market crack you would have build up enough cash.
I have been building cash for the last 4 years.
Will be building another year or so at least

what i meant was during bad times,
 
for many people, they would still not use the cash reserves built up prior, to go in and buy
 
since there would be a high possibility of losing one's job.

Incorrect.As i already mentioned, i dont look for prices to be anything when i buy.
I dont care so much as where prices are on a stand alone basis.
I care that whereever they are, i can buy if i wanted to on a relative basis
Therefore I build my cash reserves or equivalent.
 
It is also true that i collected rent and enjoyed a bit of capital appreciation between 2010 until mid 2013 when i sold my investment property.  The cash is now put to good use and i am satisfied paying the opportunity cost of holding liquidity.  And what makes you think that my returns on investment would be lower than rent?

Dude, if you had enough cash reserves to buy a real (read: not MM) condo without taking a loan, you wouldnt be afraid to lose your job.
 
Unless, that is, if you spend like some of the crazy buggers out there.
Then you'll have to take a lifestyle hit.
 
Therefore, my rule has always been to up my lifestyle only if i can carry it without a job.

You trying to drum up property sales ?!!. Ahahahahah....
As mentioned, the direction is clear,  Downward.
Just how quickly, and how much more than 10% .
 
Buying a property extends way way beyond just the simple play of interest rates.
Especially with the CMs on credit.
Cash remains KING.

now .. it's quite clear to everyone that number of transactions have decreased steadily ...
and while the % mass market sales remained relatively stable, it started decreasing this year (as seen above). of course, i wont even try to convince you that a drop in just 1 quarter means the sky is falling, but based on market sentiment, my assumption is that there definitely seems to be a slowdown (and affordability is an issue if there are less mass market units being sold ...)
 
(sorry for the formatting issues, all the tables i pasted didnt come out ..)

bro ... nobody know the timing la. when u enter and u get good tenant and a fair return ... just go for it. if u can secure decent corporate tenant and rental covers mortgage (and a 0.5% increase) .. you can consider liao. cherry on top if can cover mcst and prop tax !

The lowest psf was $1416, so effectively only 3.3% drop le. 
 
But if compare the highest psf $1893, then it is a whopping 27.6%. 

More clarify now, indeed it is about 10% drop ($1416 -> $1267).

Aiyoh! Plse lah, brother.
 
Who doesnt know that from 2014 onwards there is going to be a surge of property launches.
The developers who jumped on the bandwagon a few years ago have to all let it go let it go....otherwise kena frozen, wahahahaha ...supply will flood the market.  So many projects still not fully sold after 2-3yrs.
 
 i can tell you, the developers have only one card to play now.
That is to shrink. The size and the price.  
Who cant afford a $1mil aprartment right?
And who cares how big or where it is as long as we can say"we own a condo" right?
 
Huat ah!

Why so happy?  
In the first place the gahmen up the price by placing ABSD and TDSR, which must be in full cash. 
 
So even if price drop 10%, it is still the same price before the govt put the stamp duty in fact u pay more cash ratio. So unless u see further drop to a level whereby people can afford the cash in front then thats the real price reduction
 
Don't get fooled by MIW, in the caveat lodge the price dropped but u still pay the same just that u pay more to gahmen instead of developer and this scheme will only benefit people like first timer buyers not for T2 bro who had so many properties collection

Sky Habitat relaunch draws crowds with lower pricesATTRACTIVE pricing and a revamped showflat drew a crowd of buyers at the Sky Habitat project in Bishan over the weekend.The Straits Times - April 21, 2014By: Melissa Tan
 
ATTRACTIVE pricing and a revamped showflat drew a crowd of buyers at the Sky Habitat project in Bishan over the weekend.Developer CapitaLand sold 80 units last Saturday as the Bishan Street 15 project - once known as the most expensive suburban condominium in Singapore - was relaunched with prices slashed by an estimated 10 per cent to 15 per cent.This brings the total number of homes sold at the 509-unit condo so far to 262.Sales figures for yesterday were not available.The strong response at the relaunch showed that buyers were still very price-sensitive, analysts said yesterday.Prices at Sky Habitat's relaunch ranged from $1,276 per sq ft (psf) to $1,590 psf, CapitaLand said.This is about 10 per cent to 15 per cent lower than the price range of $1,435 psf to $1,893 psf at the project's launch two years ago.CapitaLand said that absolute prices ranged from $984,000 for a one-bedroom plus study unit and up to $2.18 million for a three-bedder.Its spokesman noted in a statement yesterday that since Sky Habitat's initial launch in April 2012, several additional cooling measures have been introduced."Developers have to make necessary adjustments in view of the prevailing market conditions... It would not be meaningful to compare prices of units bought at different points in time," she said.The most popular units last Saturday were the three-bedders, the spokesman said, adding that about 200 cheques were collected for balloting.Buyers at the showflat yesterday told The Straits Times that the project appealed to them because of its location near Bishan MRT station and its design by star architect Moshe Safdie.The discounted prices helped to seal the deal, they added."The pricing is attractive and the design is iconic," said Madam Lilian Teo, 40, who works in the energy industry. She bought a 1,249 sq ft three-bedder for around $1.63 million or $1,304 psf.Another buyer, Mr Lau Yuk Mun, 54, said he picked up a one-bedroom plus study unit as an investment after seeing the redesigned showflat for the 710 sq ft apartment."The showflat optimised the usage of space and showed that it could be well utilised... The price is also more attractive now," he said.He paid $1,411 psf or slightly more than $1 million for the unit, and said he hopes to reap a rental yield of 4 per cent to 6 per cent.Mr Mohamed Ismail, chief executive of real estate agency PropNex, said the solid sales show that buyers and investors are "not ready to buy if the price is not right".CapitaLand has pared prices at other projects before.It slashed prices at the 1,040-unit The Interlace early last year, bringing the total discount to as much as 20 per cent. Before that, it also cut prices at the 1,715-unit D'Leedon by up to 15 per cent.Sky Habitat's next-door neighbour Sky Vue, also developed by CapitaLand, launched in September last year.It moved nine units last month at a median price of $1,532 psf and sold 494 out of its 694 units by the end of last month, according to Urban Redevelopment Authority data.

Go in when comfortable if it is your primary residence.
You need a roof over your head to move on.
Sometimes, moving on is more important than money.
 
But for investment, this is just the start.
You should know better, right?

havent see 15% drop la. 1-2 developers lowering their prices doesnt mean 15% drop .. but its a sign of things to come ..
 
with that being said, dont always assume that the big boys know what they are doing .. i have seen some major f**k ups from some big boys before ... :)
 
like T2 says ... follow your gut sometimes ... and if you need a roof over you head, then pay the price you feel is a good deal for you.

theres no global recession now, plus wat we r witnessing now in SG prop is potentially a secular bear mkt. To me property is a commodity which is supply demand driven. So even if all the cooling measures were removed, some buyers will return but it cannot portend the fact the big supply fact near term, unless garmen suddenly boost  our population up, which is unlikely before next GE.
 
I already noticed some resale props transacted at 2011 prices liao, so if u get can one at close to 2010 prices & ownstay, then yes sounds good. If u max upside in the shortest period possible, then ahve to wait for global downturn.

the old suburban condo i eyeing from last year was asking $1.3m. Now still $1.3m, but with a caveat that it is negotiable..

Look , you know you have been eyeing since last year and it is still not sold.
Therefore it's a matter of you gian more or the seller gian more.
There are also many sellers who are waiting for a Robert.
 
A true seller will price the property in line with market.
Just as a true buyer will offer in line with market.
So where do you think the market is headed.  Up or down?
When transacting a property deal whether as buyer or seller, the most important thing is that both parties are motivated and realistic.  
 
If one hang up high to sell and one lowball, then it means both not true seller nor buyer.  No deal. Waste time.
 
You will see a lot of landed houses unsold for more than 2 yrs in the market. Why? Becos the demand is just so much only.  And there are only so many Roberts out there.  People are not stupid.  In an uptrend market prices go up, in a downtrend market prices go down.  Skmple as that

to clarify, i was referring to a particular development, not a particuar unit.
 
There are listings for several same type units, all asking at the same price (>3% variance)
 
You are right that the asking and offer has to be realistic. Hence i have not contacted the agents for a long time since i am still adamant not to pay more than $1.1m. i dont want to waste their time too.
 
Guess i have to wait until next year to see how it goes

Theyre probably expecting lower prices by year end so better move all units first before cannot move at all IMO.
 
Good lah suck more $ out of system, then less liquidity then easier to nego with resale unit sellers for me :)

Bishan got several good schools within 2 km and shopping mall and crematorium.  Want to go visit dead relatives is very convenient.
 
Commonwealth got pai kia schools within 2 km and car showrooms and IKEA and near Holland V plus Orchard.
 
Next time want to work as car salesman very convenient.
 
I would not buy either one.  For the same amount of money, I would buy a bigger sized, older, freehold, resale condo in River Valley or Novena/Newton and renovate it.  Think will still have $$$$ left over for a Panamera or Cayenne.

	Higher ratio of HDB dwellers goes for small private units	Those with private addresses bought mostly over-1,000 sq ft units in Q1

The Business Times - April 24, 2014 By: Kalpana Rashiwala

[sINGAPORE] A larger proportion of private apartments andcondos bought by those with HDB addresses in the first quarter were smaller units of up to 800 square feet, compared to buyers with private addresses, shows a caveats analysis by DTZ.
Buyers with HDB addresses acquired a total of 892 non-landed private homes in the first quarter of this year. Of these, 453 units or 51 per cent were for units of up to 800 sq ft, up from a 44 per cent share for the whole of last year. The proportion has been climbing steadily in recent years, from 25 per cent in 2010 to 32 per cent in 2011 and 36 per cent in 2012.
DTZ's South-east Asia chief operating officer Ong Choon Fah said: "Those with HDB addresses could be buying a higher proportion of smaller units as the investment sum is much smaller; it comes down to affordability and managing risks. Morever, if they buy from developers, they enjoy progressive payment terms i.e. they pay for the purchase price according to the phases of the project's physical completion. If they are buying for investment, they are unlikely to want to sell until after the project has been completed - as typically, you see a price spike just before a project receives Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP). Every little bit helps."
In contrast, only about 29 per cent of the 1,014 non-landed private homes bought by those with private addresses in Q1 this year were for units up to 800 sq ft. The bulk of their purchases, 59 per cent, involved units larger than 1,000 sq ft, up from a 54 per cent share for the whole of last year.
DTZ said the increase in the proportion of purchases of non-landed private homes up to 800 sq ft by buyers with HDB addresses is probably due to them being more active in the primary or developer sales market. In Q1 2014, about 65 per cent or 581 of the total 892 non-landed private homes (of all sizes) bought by those with HDB addresses were purchased in the primary market, that is, from developers.
Lee Lay Keng, regional head (SEA), research at DTZ, noted that developers have continued to mint a higher proportion of smaller units in new projects to keep overall price quantum affordable for buyers, in view of the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework and earlier cooling measures.
"For those planning to invest, picking up a residential property from a developer at a new launch means that they enjoy the progressive payment scheme and yet can sell off the unit on receipt of TOP four years later, to avoid paying the seller's stamp duty," she added.
Put another way, of the total of 750 units of up to 800 sq ft transacted in Q1 2014, 453 units or 60 per cent were acquired by those living in HDB flats and 40 per cent by those with private addresses. It was the reverse situation for bigger units (above 1,000 sq ft). Buyers with private addresses mopped up 66 per cent of the 911 units in this size category that were sold in Q1, with purchasers with HDB addresses picking up the balance 34 per cent.
Market watchers expect small private apartments/condos to continue to be highly sought after by HDB dwellers and likewise expect developers to continue building a high proportion of such units to cater to buyers sensitive about lump-sum pricing.
"At most new launches these days, typically the smaller units - the one and two-bedders - sell the fastest," observed Mrs Ong.
Chesterton Singapore managing director Donald Han estimates that about two-thirds of HDB upgraders would be living in three or four-room HDB flats and their preferred investment in the private segment would be units less than 800 sq ft, that is, one or two-bedders - in line with their affordablility.
"Some may be buying private homes for owner occupation while keeping their HDB flats to lease out as a longer-term investment, given that net rental yields are higher for HDB flats at about 4 to 5 per cent compared to 3 to 4 per cent for private apartments.
"However, things may start to change this year if the deceleration in HDB resale prices gathers momentum. Then two things could happen. First, the wealth effect will start to diminish and some HDB dwellers may no longer wish to upgrade. Second, those in five-room HDB flats, who might previously have bought a two or three-bedder private condo, may instead opt for a one or two-bedder condo. So the signs point to continued demand for small units."

what is the level of affordability?
build smaller and smaller unit but not lower prices ... $1M-$1.5M is here to stay for the mass market 
 
Housing market still struggling, report reveals
 
To entice buyers, developers dangled offers in the form of furniture vouchers, early-bird discounts, direct price discounts and partial absorption of stamp duty. But the allure of these promotions was outweighed by affordability concerns.

Assuming 2nd property at $1.5M, dp + ABSD will cost $450K. With rental of $4K let say, how many years to recoup back the duty? The first 3 years of rental yield is like a free gift to govt.

I recalled reading a newspaper interview some years back
 
a upgrader was quoted saying that he had been saving for decades and can now finally upgrade to a condo in Pasir Ris (or tampines, cant remember)
 
Anyway, i almost fainted when i saw that he bought a 2 bedroom condo. And he was "upgrading" from an exec flat.
 
And he had 3 children (pri or sec school age)

BS it may be, but credit to agents who can make you feel like a million dollars for having creative ID to overcome small spaces
 
Similar to when agents pull out the report that average household size is shrinking, thus it is perfectly acceptable and reasonable that our average living space should shrink as well.

It was never meant to be a family-oriented place and it was never marketed as one.  More for singles and couples.... sexy living... you know, that kind of thing.  Especially for your unique unit.

That's why most condo ad on TV only show a beautiful gal with her handsome bf, both enjoying sexy living. And not showing how a family with 2 or 3 kids living in the unit.

U don't need big units lah. just u and your bf who occasionally sleeps over right? 
so in fact condo price remain the same?
 
PSF would remain the same in near future
 
overall quantum may reduce as developers choose to slash area instead of psf price

that's my point ... 5-rooms flat ... 3 bedrooms ... sibei 'kelong'
 
hdb ... 5rooms flat 110sqm
condo ... 3rooms 75sqm
 
both are 3 bedrooms ...

 
u forgot that for condo, the area is usually quite inefficient. so 75sqm would be 70sqm of usable space

Exec condos helping people meet their housing aspirations: Khaw
Some 86% of EC buyers in the last three years are HDB dwellers, he says

Most buyers of executive condominiums (ECs) in the past three years are HDB dwellers, suggesting that the EC scheme is still helping Singaporeans to meet their aspirations for private housing, said Minister for National Development Khaw Boon Wan - PHOTO: ST

 

 


11,000 EC buyers


[sINGAPORE] Most buyers of executive condominiums (ECs) in the past three years are HDB dwellers, suggesting that the EC scheme is still helping Singaporeans to meet their aspirations for private housing, said Minister for National Development Khaw Boon Wan.
In a blog post yesterday, Mr Khaw revealed that 11,000 Singaporean families bought ECs from Q4 2010 to Q4 2013.
About 86 per cent of the buyers are HDB dwellers and 55 per cent are second-timer households. Some 80 per cent earned $10,000 or less.
ECs are public-private hybrid built by private developers to allow eligible families to own a private condo at way below market price. First-timer households can enjoy a CPF Housing Grant and sales restrictions are fully lifted after 10 years.
Since the income ceiling for ECs was raised from $10,000 to $12,000 in 2011, there was a shift in profile of EC buyers over a one-year period, Mr Khaw observed.
The proportion of second-timers rose from 43 per cent to 57 per cent and those aged between 35 and 44 increased from 35 per cent to 43 per cent. "I will continue to make sure that the EC scheme stays on track, to serve the housing needs of Singaporeans," Mr Khaw said.
Recent analysis of caveats by property consultants suggests that the proportion of private condos bought by HDB dwellers has increased gradually.
In the first quarter, about 45 per cent of all buyers of private condos have HDB addresses, up from 38 per cent in the same period in 2011. A higher proportion of these buyers with HDB addresses are going for smaller units of less than 800 sq ft.
Given the muted market conditions, developers are downsizing their units to make the overall price quantum of private condominiums more affordable for buyers, DTZ had said.

why downsize the unit leh? why not downsize the psf price?
 
EC is not such good value, considering their location usually CMI
 
if buyers would look around more, they could find older & bigger condo in better location at maybe just 10% - 15% higher price.

think twice if u are thinking of going in now at $800+psf for EC..
 
In 5 yrs time, people might be able to buy a city fringe condo for the same price
 
and your holding will have to be much longer (very long if there is a sustained global financial shock & crisis)
 
And in the end, the long holding period will greatly erode your IRR

this one i agree ... the price is really runaway from reality liao
previously EC is really a money making machine
buy $500k-$600k ... sell $1M for the past few years ... sure sell
 
$800+psf for city fringe condo? you think so? i seriously don't think so.
even for OCR condo ... $800+ psf must be really ulu and far away from mrt
and now developer and agent where got say ulu one ... jurong west (lakeville) like city fringe liao
bishan is like the next best thing after orchard ... few stops mrt wor
and every piece of land in spore is like orchard > amk > toa payoh ....
coming soon bidadari, sungei tengah, paya lebar also don't what price liao

not any expert of any kind but noticing that due to the rental increases over the last few years, its beginning to take its toll on said businesses. even the big guys aren't really being spared as rent is eating up a significant portion of revenue ...

so golden question is when will the 'idiots' stop biting? 
 
 
think twice if u are thinking of going in now at $800+psf for EC..
 
In 5 yrs time, people might be able to buy a city fringe condo for the same price
 
and your holding will have to be much longer (very long if there is a sustained global financial shock & crisis)
 
And in the end, the long holding period will greatly erode your IRR

 
Very simple.  
How many bullets does each of these buyers have.
Most likely case is that, they buy one and they will be out of the market.
Next, we look at the supply available the next few months and years.
Its gonna drown the market.....
Yes sure, our govt can do something and start removing some CMs along the way.
But if they have their game played right, it wont be anytime soon....

My corporate tenant just renewed for 2 years. $200 increase.  This is his second renewal. We have an amicable relationship.
 
It is a Northeast Asian company. The unit is in Marina Bay area.
 
For certain tenants, they feel that it's ok to pay a bit more to stay put because of the kam cheng.
 
For other tenants especially from certain countries, they want to scrimp and save every cent like its their life. So those will get depressed.

Thats why prime area will always be prime area not like fake prime area being touted as real prime area.
Corporate tenants are usually good especially big multi nationals.
The HR related dep handle matters professionally and swiftly. My experience.

envisaged overall drop of 4-5% only, cry papa cry mama to lift up CM especially ABSD ... 
 

Is it time to adjust the property curbs? 
According to PropNex, prices in the CCR are expected to fall by another 2 to 3 percent in the next 3 quarters this year, with an estimated 4 to 5 percent decline in 4Q14 y-o-y due to the higher absolute quantum and larger unit sizes compared to homes in the other regions.
 
RCR price decline could slow in the second half this year, with an overall decline of about 5 percent by 4Q14 y-o-y. However, this segment could be more resilient given its dual attributes of close proximity to the city centre and lower prices compared to the high-end new private homes in CCR.
 
For OCR, PropNex expects prices of mass market homes to fall by another 2 to 3 percent this year, with an estimated 3 percent decline in 4Q14 y-o-y. This is due largely to the moderation in HDB resale flat prices which would inevitably have an adverse impact on upgraders’ purchasing power.
 
As long as borrowing costs stay low, the government is unlikely to reverse the earlier anti-speculation measures. With TDSR being a long-term instrument—and together with the ABSD, will continue dampen any speculative activity. Under such an environment, PropNex expects price weakness to persist. Assuming that current policies remain in force to year end, overall private home prices is envisaged to decline by about 4 to 5 percent in 2014 y-o-y.
 
“It may be timely to adjust some of the cooling measures—especially the ABSD, in order to ensure a sustainable growth of private property prices in the long term,” said Mr Mohd Ismail, CEO of PropNex Realty.

lower commission = lower total revenue

Property developers pulling out the stops to boost sales  SINGAPORE: Some are giving big discounts, while others are going on marketing blitzes -- property developers are pulling out all the stops to boost sales which have been hit by cooling measures. Statistics from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) on Friday showed a 1.3 per cent decline in prices in the first quarter of this year. It is the largest drop since the second quarter of 2009, when prices fell by 4.7 per cent. The Interlace condominium was launched in 2009 and some residents have since moved in. However, the project by CapitaLand still has 183 unsold units as of March 2014. Over at Whampoa East Road, the Eight Riversuites condominium has 205 unsold units. However, the 862-unit project was one of the top sellers last month, when it sold 44 units. It was the project's highest sales volume in a single month since June 2013, when the government tightened property loan rules. Under the Total Debt Servicing Ratio framework, home buyers can only loan up to 60 per cent of his or her income. The units were sold at a median price of about S$1,100 psf -- almost 20 per cent lower compared to when the project was first launched some two years back, when it was sold at S$1,340 psf. Property watchers Channel NewsAsia spoke to said developers may be under pressure to cut prices in order to boost sales. Nicholas Mak, executive director at SLP International Property Consultants, said: "If a certain residential project has been launched for quite some time and still has substantial unsold units, and this project is quite near to its completion date, the developers may be under some pressure to increase sales. "Because if let's say the development is completed and there is still quite a number of unsold units, they (the developers) could also be facing competition from other developments that could be newly-launched in the vicinity." Jones Lang LaSalle's national director of research and consultancy Ong Teck Hui said: "Since the TDSR was introduced in June 2013, the number of unsold units in launched private residential projects has increased significantly by 19 per cent from 5,243 units in Q2 2013 to 6,247 units in Q1 2014. "This is reflective of the slower take-up of units at new sales launches, resulting in the build-up of unsold units." Besides cutting prices, developers are also trying other tactics. Sales for the Sky Habitat project at Bishan Street 15 picked up in April, after a marketing blitz. In a statement issued on Friday on its first quarter earnings, developer CapitaLand said 106 units were sold in April -- after more than six months of single-digit sales volume, according to URA's figures. "Another strategy that some developers may embark on is to increase the sales commission for agents," Mr Mak added. "For example, a one percentage point reduction may not be that attractive to buyers. However, if developers were to raise the commission by one percentage point of the price, that absolute amount will give a lot more incentive to the property agents to work harder in attracting buyers." The competition is expected to intensify with close to 15,000 projects, including executive condominiums, set to be completed. This brings the total number of units to be completed in 2014 to almost 20,000 -- higher than the some 14,400 units in 2013.  - CNA/ac

Property developers pulling out the stops to boost sales	
 
SINGAPORE: Some are giving big discounts, while others are going on marketing blitzes -- property developers are pulling out all the stops to boost sales which have been hit by cooling measures.	
Statistics from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) on Friday showed a 1.3 per cent decline in prices in the first quarter of this year. It is the largest drop since the second quarter of 2009, when prices fell by 4.7 per cent.

And the median price dropped by 20%??!!  Oh really?  Its been less than 6mths leh...

why u so angry?
 
it is the buyer's fault mah. So greedy, 1% discount also don;t want to bite. Must have 20% discount then jump in
 
so might as well give the 1% to agent who will work quadruplely harder to sell it to buyers

why so confused?
 
Let me enlighten u!
 
true that property price is always on the rise. Wait and see after 10 yrs. If not higher, then wait 20 yrs. If not then 30 yrs. Will go up one!
 
No need to worry about all these unsold units. They are history. In sg, only new launch is King. Doesn't matter if development under construction beside is selling 20% lower, people will still wanna buy new launch hokay!
 
The unsold units can crash and burn but new launch pricing still the same. Eg jurong $1,300 psf also got many many people buy. Upcoming Yishun at $1,300 psf also will have many many people buy. And upcoming queenstown at $1,700 psf also will have many many people buy. nevermind u can get a D11 freehold for about the same price.
 
Last, please do not try to time the market bottom. Just buy now and hold, 10 , 20 , 30 yrs hosay liao. Sleep easy at night and strike it rich when you are old and dying

Mickey mouse units below $1mil, perhaps still quite a handful.Not much ABSD to talk about. Sup sup suay.
But the fact that a reasonable TDSR can halt the market shows that the buying is largely fueled by high leverage. Which is quite unhealthy.
 
Even if there are "many" people buying second property, the buying is very muted today, as banks hv to be more stringent, no more frenzy activities.
 
So sad for those fellas who rush to buy at 20% higher, lan lan lose a nice premium conti, aiyoh....

Three-quarters of units at The Sorrento sold 
[sINGAPORE] About 100 of the 131 units in upcoming freehold condominium The Sorrento on West Coast Road, which was launched for sale last Friday, were snapped up over the Easter weekend.Initially, 80 units were launched but eventually all 131 units in the Allgreen Properties development were released due to strong demand."The project was competitively priced, so we expected to have a fairly decent pick-up (rate)," said Joseph Tan, executive director (residential) of sole marketing agent CBRE, yesterday. The pricing was between $1,380 and $1,600 per square foot (psf).The freehold status as well as the smaller scale of the development - which offers a degree of exclusivity vis-a-vis condominiums with hundreds of units - also proved a draw for buyers, added Mr Tan. Smaller units were popular with younger buyers while families opted for bigger ones.The five-storey development - offering one- to three-bedroom units ranging from 441 to 1,808 sq ft - is situated on a site of about 78,100 sq ft. The units yet to be sold are said to be largely penthouses.Similar five-storey project launches in West Coast/Pasir Panjang last year - such as Icon@Pasir Panjang, Seasuites, Village@Pasir Panjang and Whitehaven - have seen average transacted prices of $1,600 to $1,700 psf.The Sorrento is expected to obtain its temporary occupation permit (TOP) in the first quarter of next year.

prime is always prime ... like OptimusPrime 
prime in terms of location, freehold, exclusivity is always sought after
$psf or ABSD is not an issue ... sup sup water
 
if take west coast highway ... everyday kena tailgate by truck or windscreen kena stone chips ... 
opps ... abit sour grape already ... excuse me ... lol
anyway, i cannot afford this project la ... so i'm not confused
 

 
There is still real demand but thats about it.
Another 100 buyers out of the market after this purchase.
And the developers know that fact very well, that is why nobody is holding back.
They are all rushing to launch due to limited demand.  
If can sell now quickly sell!
Yet some silly private individual sellers are stubborn.
Becos they hv been Roberts so they are expecting a Robert to buy at higher price from them.
 
It continues to point down.

Dude it isnt hard at all.
 
DLeedon, interlace, skyhabitat have been around for ages and they are huge developments
So buyers are already super tired of them.  It has basically hit saturation for such developments.
The only way is additional 10-20% discount to move the remaining 20% unsold.
 
As for Sorrento, a completely new launch with only 130units, reduced price, and freehold.
Its only natural that they sell ok.  However, 100 out of 130 is still 75% only.
In the good o' days it would hv been all sold within the day with people queuing up for more.
 
Even if it were completely sold today, there is no surprise, as long as the prices are reasonable vis a vis the features and location, it will still be alright.  The scary part is that for every buyer who buys, the demand shrinks, unlike before.
 
This is why the 15,000 to 16,000 units that developers hv yet to launch is going to crash the market or disable it at the very least.  This is why behind the facade of a calm, nonchalant developer is a sweaty palmed, knobbly kneed, anxiously pacing CEO.  They KNOW.
 
How about those experts who said 5-10% drop was a maybe when idiots like me say that 15-20% is a given?    I wonder if i am stupid or they are lying.....
 
So there, it aint hard at all.

well one of the key aspects of the days when units were sold like kachang puteh was the fact that you could buy multiple units without worrying about financing. now however, is a different ball game. now dont even need to see if you dont bother sounding out your banker first ...

I'm not worry about developers, they can resort to desperate measures like we see now. My guess is those buyers who bought in the last 2-3 years will get hardest hit. They bought at peak, and to realize no rental demand, plus possible interest hike. But what can we say, they went in with greed and eyes wide open.

We've been hearing about property glut in '14-'16 for a few years already, esp since last GE when Khaw decided to ramp up hdb development.

T related property companies can be quite daft. Notice a similar recurring theme among the projects you named? 
 
Not as if other firms have not moved big developments.

Yup correct.
 
It will not crash, it will be more realistic.
That is 15-20% off current sellers' marked up asking prices.

maybe... those numbers make a trend, so a trend is a trend until its broken...
 
so maybe prop prices will be sideways until at least 2016 GE... p8p is keeping prices in check, & if they lose more seats, our immigration policy may tighten further, then population growth declines & if stock mkt collapse again, 2017 got show liao.
 
anyway i anyhow guess one lah.

looks like Ho bee never ho last quarter
 
No sale: Property developer Ho Bee Land didn’t sell a single unit last quarter
 
The high-end property market carnage continues.
 
Ho Bee Land is known for its high end condos in ritzy addresses like Sentosa with developments such as the Turquoise. Yet in this market, the big spenders are not coming out and the company didn’t record a single sale of a new property during the first quarter of this year.
 
It shows just how bad Singapore’s high end luxury property market is. CIMB Analyst Tan Xuan told Singapore Business Review the lack of sales was expected but that it’s a concern and shows the problems with selling high-end properties and Sentosa properties in particular. She added that Ho Bee has decided to rent out units in Sentosa rather than sell them, a trend that has been ongoing for some time.
 
Naturally the results are bad, and were below even the pessimistic expectations.
 
Ho Bee Land w 1Q14 revenue and PATMI dropped 72% and 92% yoy, respectively, as there were no units sold during the quarter, and thus no recognition of revenue for development properties, noted CIMB’s Tan.
The rental income from industrial and commercial properties increased by 495% yoy and contributed to 93% of revenue, largely from its office buildings, The Metropolis in Singapore and Rose Court in London. Residential properties’ rents accounted for the remaining 7%.
 
We expect rental income to underpin FY14-15 earnings, specifically from The Metropolis and the two commercial buildings in London. Additionally, its rental income should improve in the coming quarters as more tenants move into The Metropolis (94% committed) and the recently acquired commercial building in London at 1 St Martin’s Le Grand starts contributing. 
 
Overseas developments to contribute to earnings from FY15. Management has demonstrated foresight in increasing its exposure to investment properties ahead of weak development income. The overseas developments in Australia and China acquired over the past three years should start contributing meaningfully to earnings in 2015-16.

did this chart in jan 2013 before hdb resale prices peaked. think it went above my upper green line then dropped, so the 1996 peak probably matches 2013 peak as well & is parallel to lower green line.
 
http://www.singstat.gov.sg/statistics/visualising_data/chart/HDB_Resale_Price_Index.html
 
for all fibonacci fans, a reminder of the golden ratio & sequence:
 
23.6%38.2%61.8% (The Golden Ratio)78.6% (Square root of The Golden Ratio)88.6% (Square root of 0.786)100%112.7% (Forth root of 161.8%)127.2% (Square root of 161.8%)138.2% (Addition of 100% and 38.2%)161.8% (1 divided by 0.618)200%261.8% (Addition of 100% and 161.8%)
 
At any of those %, its a major point, so as seen in the resale index, it hit abt 200% & turned back. If it doesnt recover soon, then its likely the major lower support is 161.8% fib retracement = abt 162 on the resale index = equates to abt 20% decline from peak & still within the green trendline channel. For some condos, it has already corrected abt 20% in price?
 
This is what im looking for when im going to buy my next prop. To break that green 3 decade long trendline is a major problem & its a minority scenario at the moment, so 138.2% is unlikely & if it happens, a short & sharp event.

Wah, u very zhun !

I am just disciplined. 
What is an investment is an investment, dont hv sentimental feelings for it.
I said it so many times here.
Also for porperties, we need to start a bit early as it takes a while to sell.
If you think you are ready to sell, you willneed another 3 mths to six mths before the sale actually goes thru.  We gotta factor that in.  
 
Secondly dont depend on hope. Face the facts and act.
 
Good luck.

They bought at peak, and to realize no rental demand, plus possible interest hike. But what can we say, they went in with greed and eyes wide open.
 
 

 
The main thing to watch out for is whether this group of buyers have the holding power, if not they will have to dump their properties into the market in the next 2-3 years once interest rates start moving up. Which of course will contribute to further drop of the market, which the government has only one solution to stop the drop - open the floodgate to immigrants and foreign buyers.

I think you got it slightly wrong.
It aint about holding power this time
Too much unsold unit is too much unsold units.
A flood that overflows the dam.  The water need to be dumped into the sea not kept in the dam.
 
The situation sucks, nobody wants to hold even if they can.
They rather sell and move the cashflow.

ya lo .. a lot wont make the same mistake twice. they rather take cash, wait for market to drop, then re enter ... (even if financing etc is more difficult, the key is that CASH IS KING) ... if you can, lowering your gearing is the best way to go right now.
 
better to side on cash and sit on the sidelines. dont sell everything, but sell enough to have some "ammo". if market goes up, you still have assets. if market comes down, you'll have ample cash to go in. win win for you. lowering your current risk at the moment makes sense due to market sentiments ... imho ...

Ho Bee is not a luxury player IMO. Everyone wants to be a luxury player but scrimp and save on concept and design. Getting a celebrity concept architect does not make the development a high end one. Using Poggenpohl kitchens does not make a development a high end one. And for goodness sake developers should stop producing developments with the ugly bay windows.
 
SCGlobal is the only one close to a high end player. I said close. Tough words from a nobody like me but yeah that's my opinion.

You can find which developer is screwed and which developer is holding well.
But in this situation, the stupid one is the one that doesnt let his inventory go.

Thanks for the earlier advice. Noted that the discussions are mostly on new launches.

b) Also how bout a freehold landed (3800 sq ft) in Bishan, from a seller perspective? 6-7 mins walk to MRT.
 
For a) may move in or invest
      b) sell & move in to a)
 
Think the major question is when to sell b) ?  TIA.

iProperty Survey Shows Pricing Concern Amid Unshaken Confidence in Property
 
no worry ... we have unshaken confidence that can defy the law of gravity
property outlook is as viagra strong as coe ... huat ah!
 
The iProperty Asia Property Market Sentiment Report H1 2014 (APMSR), Asia’s  largest consumer sentiment survey, reveals Singaporeans’ broad support for cooling measures and expectations of falling prices, while expressing unshaken confidence in property as an investment, both nationally and internationally. It also suggests growing pent-up demand, with private condominiums top of the purchase wish list.

how many percent from MCF ... 100%? 
 
 
There is a huge jump in respondents who see property as a long-term investment – 53 per cent, up from 23 per cent. 23 per cent also intend to buy a property within the next 12 months, and an additional 28 per cent within the next one to two years. Over two-thirds (67 per cent) have a preference for new developments and more – 71 per cent up from 69 per cent – are interested in purchasing a private condominium.

This type of survey chun meh? It really depend on the target audience. If you survey someone at showroom who is ready to buy, his confidence is unshaken. If you survey someone who bought at peak and now sitting at paper loss, his confidence is shaken. If you survey someone rushing to sell now, his has no confidence.

 Sims Drive site attracts top bid of $530.9m

A residential site (pictured) at Sims Drive attracted four bids when the tender closed on Tuesday, said HDB. Launched for sale on 30 December 2013, the 23,900.1 sqm plot has a gross floor area (GFA) of 71,700.3 sqm and plot ratio of 3.0. The top bid of about $530.9 million was submitted by GuocoLand's First Changi Development. This translates to around $7,404 psm on the GFA.
Developer Sim Lian Land offered the lowest bid of $356 million, which is approximately 33 percent lower than GuocoLand's tender price. Offered on a 99-year lease, the site could be developed into a condominium project or flats. A combination of flats and strata landed houses can also be built with prior written approval. HDB noted that the site is expected to yield 900 homes. 
Desmond Sim, Head, CBRE Research, Singapore said: "The site is located about 300m from the Aljunied MRT station and within the Paya Lebar Sub-Regional Centre, an up and coming commercial hub. The bids demonstrate that developers are still hungry for land with good attributes such as established amenities and situated in a good location. "In addition, CBRE observed that while land prices are affected by general market sentiments and specific site attributes, they are also a reflection of other considerations such as foreign labour crunch, and pre-fabrication requirements that have contributed to the rise in development cost." 
A decision on the award of the tender will be announced at a later date after the bids have been evaluated.

Thanks for the earlier advice. Noted that the discussions are mostly on new launches.
 
a) Whats ur view of existing 999 lease, 10yo condo like the SpringBloom at Chuan Park (3 bedroom). across the road have MRT.  Will price go up, down or maintain over the next 2 yrs. From a buyer perspective. ?
 
b) Also how bout a freehold landed (3800 sq ft) in Bishan, from a seller perspective? 6-7 mins walk to MRT.
 
For a) may move in or invest
      b) sell & move in to a)
 
Think the major question is when to sell b) ?  TIA.

 
My view is for residential property to drop regardless of new, old, condo or landed.
But obviously the one that will lead the drop are the new ones.
As for the older ones, they will move in tandem with market although not at the same degree.
 
Landed 3800sft land is good size, but the demand for such a property is limited.
Also depends on age and build.
If you are selling to take profit, should hv done so last yr.
 There is more room for the residential market to come off.
Landed homes need to take at least a 10% hit from last done prices to move sales.
That said, yours could be the best on that street, i cant say
 
 
Good luck.

a. Springbloom is a 99-year leasehold project, not 999-year leasehold. Proximity to MRT has already been priced into current prices.
 
b. As long as growth fundamentals for Singapore remain sound, long-term (10-20 years) for FH/999LH land is up. If you are talking about short-term (6 months to 2 years), all boats go lower with an ebbing tide.

Thanks. 10% hit is heavy. Will waiting out 3-4 yrs help in yr opinion, assuming theres no global crisis.?

99year lease? unless I got the condo wrong.
 
So if its in 2015, it could mean sell 10% less, but get 2 units also at 10% less each.

problem for old currently is that their rents are under big pressure as more n more new condos TOP & tenants rather rent the new place for a little more than stay in an old place, so the old prop rents have to discount alot more than new to get tenant.

i thk even if rates dont go up next few yrs, the supply problem will keep rents & cap values in check for awhile, so flat for a few yrs then a dip due to a long overdue global recession which will setup a nice bounce for the next leg up.

@omom ur right. Not just SB. The Chiltern, CHuan Park, The Scala, all 99 yrs. Based on 3 bedroom, seems that regardless of whether its built in 1985-1995-1999-2014, the prices is like 1.5-1.6.
 
Its like prices similar, its whether u want older with bigger area or newer with less space. (Based on 3 bed room)
 
These are all private condo right? sigh 99yrs. Thought it was 999yrs.
 
compared to Regentville (D19), built 2000, 99yrs, seems that that Lorong Chuan Mrt is worth at least 500k !!!

Bolah Bolah, hard to explain. Not my house & I also didnt initiate the idea to owner.
Anyway, the place I believe is still on tenancy till mid next year.
 
Its a case of people wanting an individual home for their respective family unit. However, none have the ability the upkeep/stay in the place solo. And even if any party try to put up violent finincial struggle to stay in there solo.......red eyes pandemic would surface.
 
Unless 1 side suddenly become high flyer & earn big big $, move in & appease other stake holders.

The closest 999LH condo in that area would be The Chuan which is next to the Australian International School and Goldenhill Park Condo which is opposite Springbloom is FH.
 
Markets are generally quite efficient except when under duress so all current prices would have priced in any advantages that the projects have e.g. proximity to MRT.
 
One of the best buys in that area for investment ten years ago would have been New Tech Park (commercial) but the developer-owner CDL smartly kept the entire project for themselves.

Thanks, I just checked at Property Guru. Seems that The Chuan being a 15min walk from mrt cost about 200k more all other things equal. Goldernhill Park which is 5 min walk from mrt is 300-350k more compared to those other surrounding 99yr lease.
 
In this case, between 99 & 999, what are the implications when the place reaches 30-40 yo , eg if enbloc, ..failed enbloc & continue staying there or just sell off.  Is the xtra 300k paid to get 999 worthwhile? Eg, can pass down gen to gen & of enbloc will make lots significantly more compared to 99yrs.
 
Somehow, 99yrs dun feel very safe to me. Though we have a family friend whose Farrer Court HUDC enbloc got 2.0 to which he/she had the choice to either buy another 999 condo with a little change for a Jippin car or 99 condo with 0.5 balance, or a 5rm HDB and have 1.5 to retire comfortably.
 
Pardon my noob questions. As I am kinda stuck with the COE mindset whereby once car reach 10yrs no more value, vs a car in australia where u can drive till car disintegrate. Having  sentiments on 99 though I believe its probably a lot more complex than the COE, PQP, PARF issues.
Oh i see, ok when the idea become reality, you know who to look for. I love to cut out the agent and buy from owners direct. House Cars Watches same same
 
noted. Think u were the guy who mentioned u always rather buy direct from owner (Cars) as theres more integrity ?

here is my thought
 
condo = go with 99yrs. sell when price is good (highly speculated) to make lots of money and move on or live in 10-15-20 yrs and sell. based on the eXpert analysis, 99yrs condo provide the best ROI in terms of rental yield and capital appreciation for resale because of its lower entry price point  compare to freehold condo project
 
landed = go with freehold. the land is priceless. so much potential and so much worth it.

LH properties in CBD are more expensive than many FH ones - where got lower entry price?
 
Property is about location. You pay a higher price for property in good location and you're more guaranteed to get better rental and capital appreciation when the market moves up - % wise I'm not sure. Maybe someone can show data.

i thought this is more or less "market info" liao?
$1200-$1300psf is the market rate for mass market 99LH condo
 
1-bedder = $600k-$750k
2-bedder = $900k-$1.1M
3-bedder = $1.2M to $1.5M
 
anything below $1.5M is good to go liao ... property eXpert says one

new launches although the useable space is smaller than old project
the design, layout, balcony, landscape, etc are all better than 2004-2009 condo completed projects
 
seriously, if not making $250k-$1M or more ... who buy property? that's why people is crazy about property.
yes, they are many other tools of investments ... property is the most layman investment instrument to flip

Chuan Park is a good example of what happens when the project reaches 30 years of age. Its TOP was in 1985 so that makes the project around 30 years old. Its value was given a shot in the arm when the location of Lorong Chuan MRT was announced, although it was quite a bitter-sweet experience (sweet because it sits just outside the MRT station entrances and bitter because part of its land was acquired by the government for the MRT station).
 
Generally for 99LH projects, the value fall-out quickens after the 40th to 50th year mark due to several factors such as escalating maintenance costs, borrowing/financing restrictions due to the remaining lease of project, CPF utilisation, etc.
 
Not all residential projects are well managed and management/sinking funds do get depleted/low when major repairs turn up sooner than expected. There have been cases in smaller projects where residents are called upon to top up the sinking funds in order to raise sufficient funds for major and pressing works.
 
Enbloc is not always guaranteed. With almost all projects that are less than 20 years old having GFA maximised, there is little incentive for developers to pay a premium over market rates unless there are special circumstances e.g. to combine the land from the potential-enbloc project with an existing land in its land-bank.
 
In spite of all the above, IMHO a 99LH property can still make a good buy if you manage to get it at the start of a bull run. This significantly reduces the downside risk and provides several advantages over competing 999LH/FH properties: lower entry cost, lower financing cost (if not paying fully in cash), etc while still enjoying the pricing-lift from the bull market.
 
However, enter at the wrong time and the fact that the property is 99LH exacerbates/compounds the loss that the buyer will experience from the bear-phase fall-out.
 

 
Thanks, I just checked at Property Guru. Seems that The Chuan being a 15min walk from mrt cost about 200k more all other things equal. Goldernhill Park which is 5 min walk from mrt is 300-350k more compared to those other surrounding 99yr lease.
 
In this case, between 99 & 999, what are the implications when the place reaches 30-40 yo , eg if enbloc, ..failed enbloc & continue staying there or just sell off.  Is the xtra 300k paid to get 999 worthwhile? Eg, can pass down gen to gen & of enbloc will make lots significantly more compared to 99yrs.
 
Somehow, 99yrs dun feel very safe to me. Though we have a family friend whose Farrer Court HUDC enbloc got 2.0 to which he/she had the choice to either buy another 999 condo with a little change for a Jippin car or 99 condo with 0.5 balance, or a 5rm HDB and have 1.5 to retire comfortably.
 
Pardon my noob questions. As I am kinda stuck with the COE mindset whereby once car reach 10yrs no more value, vs a car in australia where u can drive till car disintegrate. Having  sentiments on 99 though I believe its probably a lot more complex than the COE, PQP, PARF issues.
 
noted. Think u were the guy who mentioned u always rather buy direct from owner (Cars) as theres more integrity ? 

 
It still boils down to the buyer's profile - the ammunition he has on-hand, tools of leveraging available to him, his risk appetite, buying/selling style (frequent/infrequent for example), etc.
 

here is my thought
 
condo = go with 99yrs. sell when price is good (highly speculated) to make lots of money and move on or live in 10-15-20 yrs and sell. based on the eXpert analysis, 99yrs condo provide the best ROI in terms of rental yield and capital appreciation for resale because of its lower entry price point  compare to freehold condo project
 
landed = go with freehold. the land is priceless. so much potential and so much worth it.
 
yes / no? i would like to hear more point of view

ok, i know The Sail @ Marina Bay 99LH condo can buy FH unit including landed at many areas
let's say a better comparison like OCR FH vs LH? anyway, FH project is extremely limited nowadays ... definitely not cheap if 1 come by
 
 
 
i thought this is more or less "market info" liao?
$1200-$1300psf is the market rate for mass market 99LH condo
 
1-bedder = $600k-$750k
2-bedder = $900k-$1.1M
3-bedder = $1.2M to $1.5M
 
anything below $1.5M is good to go liao ... property eXpert says one
 
 

I was referring to the ROI for FH and LH properties. One needs to look at the data to reach a conclusion. ROI is dependent on many factors - location of property, leverage, unit layout etc. You can't blanket a conclusion based on 2 broad categories (FH and LH).
 
In General, one would expect higher rental and appreciation of asset value for a property in a good location vs one in a sub par location. However the exact ROI is dependent on the factors I stated above. Please feel free to correct my mistakes if there are any.

that's why many buy new launches (no previous owner) instead of resale
is that consider 'n'th sucker too?
new launches although the useable space is smaller than old project
the design, layout, balcony, landscape, etc are all better than 2004-2009 condo completed projects
 
seriously, if not making $250k-$1M or more ... who buy property? that's why people is crazy about property.
yes, they are many other tools of investments ... property is the most layman investment instrument to flip
 
 

Interestingly you mentioned balcony. I personally think balcony is useless if the living space is less than 70sqm. But yet developers are churning out small apartments with balconies. The apartments have bedrooms that can hardly accommodate  a queen size bed and yet balconies were included. You know why? It's because of URA's GFA incentive for balconies. Read that up. It's interesting.
 
Instead of designing a unit that makes the most sense and has proper usable space, the developers are following the design incentives and guidelines because it directly affects the total area for sale. And you wonder why the private residential landscape in Singapore looks so boring and similar.

Indeed. When I was renovating my 100 sqm 4rm flat, actually wanted to DIY a balcony that eats into my living room. But the due to size contraints, it was awkward & I gave up the idea. 
 
I wanted it to be my smoking point where I can light up w/o exposing my daughters to 2nd hand smoke & coating the house progressively with 3rd hand smoke. But anyway I stay on a low floor. So I just take the stairs down every 1.5-2hrs.

For me its likely not for investment but stay in. But nonetheless, i dont want to be a robert :( .With so much talk on the next recession & Garmen stabilizing the market for 2015, may not be bad to let the landed go after tenency (or maybe renew another 6-12mths) & wait for market to crash in 2017-2018 
 
Very insightful info u shared on the probs that aging condo faces.

SINGAPORE: The Commonwealth Towers condominium near the Queenstown MRT station saw strong demand at its launch on Thursday.
Developers said that as at 8pm, 175 of the 400 units launched were sold, with at least another 100 buyers waiting in line.
One property analyst said the lack of recent launches in the area may have driven up sales for the project.
 
Many people took advantage of the May Day holiday to check out the latest property launch in the Queenstown area.
Franky Lim, a potential buyer, said: "This is quite a good location. The psf (per square foot) is slightly over what we thought it would be. The quantum is also not small so we are still considering."
 
The most popular are the two-bedroom units, which are going from S$965,000.
More than 50 per cent of those units have since been sold.
 
The launch saw 300 units on offer initially but developers decided to add another 100 in view of the strong demand.
The development has a total of 845 units consisting of one- to four-bedroom units ranging from 441 to 1,302 square feet.
 
Prices start from S$721,000 for the one-bedroom units to S$2.2 million for a four-bedroom unit. Analysts said the lack of recent launches in the area may have boosted sales for the Commonwealth Towers project.
The last condominium in the area was launched some four years ago.
 
Ku Swee Yong, CEO of Century 21 Singapore, said: "Today's showing is (also) evidence that there are a lot of investors who, firstly they qualify under the TDSR (Total Debt Servicing Ratio) and ABSD (Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty) rules, and they are also happy to put their investment money to work in a product that is well-located as well as with good interior furnishings."
 
Attractive prices are also important in drawing buyers, especially for two upcoming projects at Kim Tian Road and Prince Charles Crescent.
 
Prices have not been released yet but analysts expect developers to take the cue from the market reaction for Commonwealth Towers.
Channel NewsAsia understands that the Kim Tian Road site has the highest land cost at S$1,163 psf per plot ratio. This is followed by the Prince Charles Crescent plot at S$960 psf ppr.
 
Another project which opened for preview on Thursday is the Waterfront @ Faber. The 199-unit development at Clementi saw some 400 visitors at its showflat.

There's almost no such thing as FH/999 and near to MRT. 
 
Except maybe Shunfu area. 
 
It's either FH but further from MRT (> 15 min leisure walk) or 99 yr and within 3 min to MRT.
 
Best if the MRT is underground.

Especially if your unit is priced lower due to facing etc, you csn stomach a corresponding lower rent and active the same yield as your neighbour owners.

hey man, im just a number cruncher. i only spit out the numbers 
each person is free to form their own opinion based on hard numbers ;)

 
bro ... nobody know the timing la. when u enter and u get good tenant and a fair return ... just go for it. if u can secure decent corporate tenant and rental covers mortgage (and a 0.5% increase) .. you can consider liao. cherry on top if can cover mcst and prop tax !

 
Hmm, are you saying if can cover mortgage, mcst and property tax, its a no-brainer?

keep location in mind and whether you can support the property in the event that there's no tenant for say, 6 months to a year. if you can do this, then it should be fine. also keep in mind rising interest rates (that's why i said, if you can make a little extra its safer).
 
current market returns for residential may be hard to cover all of those expenses ... so if you can find ... then why not? better than having the $ sit in your bank account and not doing much ...

- Kovan Melody 1.55m , 1250sqft 3br.
2006, 800 units.  (Approx)
 
- Kovan Residences 1.7m , 1250sqft 3br. 2011, 500 units. (Approx)
 
- Noted right beside MRT, very near Heartland Mall, hawker, NTUC, Cold Storage, overall newer.
 
But yet pricing similar to Chuan Park area. Is it because further from Town & expressway?
 
Also heard that most ideal is for # of units to be at 500. Because, too few high cost as fewer SP to divide. Too many, difficult to get things done. Eg, enbloc, pass resolutions.
 
From a live in perspective, will the options at Chuan or Kovan be better. Both areas are near kid's school & near both side's parents place. .
 
 
PS : Hmm, just noted that Castle Green also seems not bad.
1997, 664 units, price about 300k less than above, yet 5 mins walk to MRT.
Location slightly off but still familiar enough.
 
Btw, since each SP is entitled to a car lot. If a SP choose to park his motorcycle there, will there be a problem? Thanks

- Kovan Melody 1.55m , 1250sqft 3br.
2006, 800 units.  (Approx)
 
- Kovan Residences 1.7m , 1250sqft 3br. 2011, 500 units. (Approx)
 
- Noted right beside MRT, very near Heartland Mall, hawker, NTUC, Cold Storage, overall newer.
 
But yet pricing similar to Chuan Park area. Is it because further from Town & expressway?
 
Also heard that most ideal is for # of units to be at 500. Because, too few high cost as fewer SP to divide. Too many, difficult to get things done. Eg, enbloc, pass resolutions.
 
From a live in perspective, will the options at Chuan or Kovan be better. Both areas are near kid's school & near both side's parents place. .
 
 
PS : Hmm, just noted that Castle Green also seems not bad.
1997, 664 units, price about 300k less than above, yet 5 mins walk to MRT.
Location slightly off but still familiar enough.
 
Btw, since each SP is entitled to a car lot. If a SP choose to park his motorcycle there, will there be a problem? Thanks

 
I can give u the last transacted for these places if you want.
 
as for bike parking in car lot - need to check with mcst but from my experience, most wont allow since your neighbors may kpkb ...

Thanks, but should be ok.  I can check at URA site just like checking at HDB site for recent transactions (which I had prev done) right ?
 
hmm I see. In this case if a condo owner does not have a car llst, esp since there wont be concessions on maintenance fees.
 
Thinking of something no older than 20yrs at point of moving in. So that should I reno, I get to use what I paid for. Assuming stay there for 20yrs, the place would be 40yo already.
 
Assuming have both hdb & condo, it actually makes more sense to rent out the latter. But main incentive for condo is for my daughters. esp during primary/secondary sch days. Much safer environment downstairs for cycling, moving about in general.
 
I heard 1 input frpm a guy whom mentioned, the Garmen will never allow a condo/hdb to cross 40-50yo. If cant enbloc, they will 1 way or another force a sale of sorts. Is there any truth? If so, will it result in being under compensated? Thanks

no idea. i have the system access (and just checked that there were 2 transactions on april 21st, one for kovan melody and one for kovan residences, both transacted at 10% and 25% less than what you specified as the seller's price)
 
not sure about hdb rulings so hopefully another bro with more experience can help you with that

For condo, govt cannot force it to enbloc. it is based on market forces and willing buyer seller
 
For HDB, it is also not a guarantee that it will be enbloc. Pls see below
 
Mr Khaw Boon Wan (The Minister for National Development): The Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) is part of the Government’s estate renewal strategy for older estates. It allows intensification of land use and revitalises such estates through new developments. At the same time, it offers an opportunity for flat owners to buy a new replacement flat with a fresh 99 year lease.
In the last 10 years, SERS has benefitted the owners of about 18,000 flats. As the name suggests, the identification of suitable precincts for SERS is selective. The selection of sites and pace of SERS will depend on factors such as their redevelopment potential, and the availability of replacement sites for rehousing and other resources.
Currently, there are about 300 HDB blocks with 31,000 flats which are more than 40 years into their 99-year flat leases.
Like all leasehold properties, HDB flats will revert to HDB, the landowner, upon expiry of their leases. HDB will in turn surrender the land to the State.

note that there is a plan to build the new NS Expressway in 2016 and I think it runs just next to Castle Green. Not sure if it isunderground or semi covered or overhead.

The seller/ agent got smoke you or not? The last 2 year transacted prices as per URA range near 1200 psf for small units and 1 100 psf for bigger units. 
 
Download the URA app and check caveat prices for yourself. 
 
For projects like the Kovan condos you listed, sure have a lot of transactions on record for your reference.

Thanks for all the invaluable input.
 
I just looking at the asking prices at propertyguru. I assume theres some mark up for bargaining. Wont be approaching agent anytime soon.
 
The Castle Green part is a wild card man, can make or break the place.
 
But in my family's case, buyer or seller mart's will cut both ways. Ideal situation will be landed up 2016, condo down 2016. But I doubt so right. Usually all interlinked.

for kovan melody - launch was $400+ psf. just checked.
 
all the new sales listed in 2004 were done at $450psf to a hair under $500 psf.
 
so quite a few owners made money.
 
for the #09-xx unit, the original owner bought in 2004 for 516psf, and sold for 952psf in 2010 and that owner in turn sold 2-3 weeks ago for 1123psf after 4 years =)
 
(too lazy to do the exact work for kovan residences since the results are similar, but a cursory look at the first 20 transactions are all around $540psf to $650psf during launch in 2009)

Ideal max is 300units thereabouts.My ideal is about 200units.
However all this is subjective, as it depends on plot size and facilities and very importantly tenant mix.
Kovan Melody, is pure mass market.
But a pretty convenient one.
 
However, the layout of the property is lousy like a maze and the plot size is too small for comfort imo.
 
I would not pay more than $800psf for this in current market.
 
Of course i am just an ah siao, plse dont mind me.
But i am the same ah siao who said that 20% down is a given from 6 mths ago.
The same ah siao who said 50% downpayment for cars is the way to go.
The same ah siao who is saying that COE prices will come off to $50k within a year.
Yup the same ah siao , i am.

I subscribe to this:
 
https://www.squarefoot.com.sg/trends-and-analysis/residential
 
In my opinion this is a value-for-money service as you get more than just caveat information.
 
Also, do refer to the following article on why Kovan land plots may not fare as well as those near Lorong Chuan in terms of future en-bloc potential:
 
http://www.stproperty.sg/articles-property/singapore-property-news/no-more-crammed-plots-ura/a/32970
 
I feel that Castle Green has too many units for comfort based on the facilities available. One measure of comfortable condo living would be the resident to facility ratio. Also, the project is getting quite old so maintenance will be a growing concern.

i do feel the same ... must wait ... how long ... dont know
anyway, just had a casual chitchat with a buddy during dinner
i start the conversation "i am not going to pay more than $800psf for mass market condo especially simi jurong, cck, tampinese"
 
then my buddy quickly cut in ... 
if fall to $800psf, the last few years new launches average $1200psf how? all kena screwed high and dry?
 
in 2009/2010 average $800psf skyrocketed to $1200psf in a short 3-4 years
so how long will it take to return to $800psf  ... 2014 gradually drop till 2016/2017?
 
anyway, those bought between 2010-2013 will not sell even property drop below $1000psf for mass market condo. be it for investment or live in ... they will hold for long long ... it is priced for the future
they might buy high but dont think there will be firesale. 6.9M population will come to the rescue.
that's end of our discussion

Dude, i think you have not understood my words, although i have explained. 
 
$800psf is just a number.
I could have said, $850, $900, 650 etc..., wont really matter.
I mean to say, Kovan Melody just isnt my target, when its $800psf, i will be buying better ones at $1500psf. 
 
I can see the winter coming so i gather like the Ant.

at this kind of expectation of bid ... how would property price go down?
 
 

Published May 01, 2014Top bid for Potong Pasir plot seen at $650-900 psf pprCommercial use capped at 5,000 sq m, or 8.8% of project's maximum GFABy Kalpana Rashiwalakalpana@sph.com.sg @KalpanaBTA COMMERCIAL and residential site next to Potong Pasir MRT Station launched for sale on the confirmed list of the Government Land Sales Programme is expected to draw four to eight bids.Property consultants' forecasts for the top bid varied from $650 to $900 per square foot of potential gross floor area. The tender for the site closes on Aug 19.The government yesterday also made available for application on the reserve list an executive condominium (EC) site at the corner of Sembawang Road and Canberra Link, although most market watchers are not expecting it to be triggered for launch anytime soon as there is sufficient EC supply.Both sites have 99-year leasehold tenures.Sites on the reserve list are launched for tender upon successful application by a developer with an undertaking of a minimum bid price acceptable to the State. Confirmed list sites, on the other hand, are launched for tender according to a known schedule, regardless of demand.The 1.6 hectare Potong Pasir site, located along Meyappa Chettiar Road, can be developed into a 13 to 16-storey project with a maximum gross floor area (GFA) of 56,523 square metres (608,408 square feet). Of this, a maximum 5,000 sq m (53,819.5 sq ft) - or 8.8 per cent of the total GFA - can be for commercial use. This includes a 500 sq m (about 5,382 sq ft) cap for restaurant use - due to traffic congestion issues. The Urban Redevelopment Authority has also banned uses such as bars, pubs, karaoke lounges, night clubs and massage parlours for the project's commercial component - as they cause or pose disamenities such as noise, disorderly behaviour and other disturbances to residents of the project as well as surrounding developments.URA has set a 5,000 sq m cap for total commercial use as there are already other retail facilities in the vicinity and in order not to strain the capacity of the road network in the area.The project's residential component can generate an estimated 685 private homes. A through-block link has been safeguarded in the development to make it convenient for commuters to walk from the MRT station to the HDB neighbourhood centre.CBRE Research head Desmond Sim said: "We expect bids to come in from blue-chip developers as well as some joint ventures to mitigate the equity investment and market risk."This will be the fifth site that URA will be selling around Potong Pasir MRT Station since 2010. The earlier plots are now being developed into three condo projects - Nin Residence, Sennett Residence and Sant Ritz - and a mixed development, The Venue Residences and Shoppes.Lee Lay Keng, DTZ regional head (SEA), Research, predicts an $800-900 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr) top bid. This is higher than the $793 psf ppr at which The Venue site nearby was awarded in September 2012 - because of the bigger commercial component compared with the earlier plot's 2,000 sq m.Jones Lang LaSalle national director Ong Teck Hui said: "With residential units in nearby developments currently selling for around $1,400 psf, bidders are likely to use this as a reference point in their pricing but also take into account a likely softening in prices by the time the project is launched for sale."As for the Sembawang EC site, consultants' estimates of its pricing range from $280 to $350 psf ppr. R'ST Research director Ong Kah Seng reckons that the earliest the plot could be triggered for release from the reserve list would be in late-Q3 or in Q4 this year. "There's some sense of oversaturation of new private homes and ECs in the immediate vicinity and in the Sembawang location in general."A City Developments-TID consortium bagged the next door EC plot at a state tender that closed in January this year at $350 psf ppr. At the 506-unit SkyPark Residences, a nearby EC project that was launched in Q4 last year, only 293 units were sold as at end-Q1 this year.

Alamak, i thought i already explained this?
 
No inventory(land) no sales.
No sales, no business.
 
"Experts" forecast bid to be between $650-900 psf, muayhaha almost 50% range who cant forecast?
 
I also predict top bid is by a company who got no "inventory"

With a showflat in their area, they will just take it as an excursion.
Must been seen there becos so are the neighbors
 
Mass Market will continue to cheong regardless, but the supply is enough drown the demand.
944 units, wah say....
Mass mean Many mah.....so there must be many many but still not enough.
And They will react at the slightest tease and nudge.
Once they buy one, they are out of the equation. 
Its still early in the game.
 
Arent you happy there are less and less to compete with?
If i were in that category of $1mil to 2mil properties, i would be jumping glad!!

i am jumping glad that the pool of buyer for $1M-$2M properties is greatly reduced
some buy because they want the location for whatever reason ie school, near parent, sentimental, etc
cant help it ... it is good people get what they want
 
i guess this is what we said "you can't have it both ways"

Just saw a post from my friend on coco palms showflat...its crowded man.
 
looks like upgraders still out in force.

Bro, i was informed that the pricing is $1000+Psf for 500sft unit and for "bigger" units , the pricing is $800++psf....  Its been a while since prices are below the $1000psf mark?
Am not sure as i dont follow this segment.
But it sounds that prices are depressed and the developers know it well to price accordingly and move their inventory.  Even so, withh 950 units, lets see if they can sell half.
 
So if anyone asks me where prices are going, i would firmly still say South.

Alamak, i thought i already explained this?
 
No inventory(land) no sales.
No sales, no business.
 
"Experts" forecast bid to be between $650-900 psf, muayhaha almost 50% range who cant forecast?
 
I also predict top bid is by a company who got no "inventory"

 
Usually Company sell and lease back property in foreseeing dwn and buy back during low. ..
 
Wonder which company has this is idea.

Fact is who people have money, dont want to buy such properties.
This is to cater to the folks who only have several hundred of thousands spare and no knowledge or avenue of investing.  But as i said, the demand is thinning out day after day.
 
An agent just informed me that seller dropped price by another $100k for me if i am sincere and show him the check.  My reply was, no need, thanks.

assuming majority of buyer/investor is above 31 years (likely) and buying 2nd or 3rd properties
LTV is 20% - 30%, this means they do have few hundreds Ks to dispose 
if hits TDSR 60% ... the 2nd MM that costs $500k-$700k is paid ca$h?
with progressive payment plan ... should be achievable, right

Interestingly you mentioned balcony. I personally think balcony is useless if the living space is less than 70sqm. But yet developers are churning out small apartments with balconies. The apartments have bedrooms that can hardly accommodate a queen size bed and yet balconies were included. You know why? It's because of URA's GFA incentive for balconies. Read that up. It's interesting.
 
Instead of designing a unit that makes the most sense and has proper usable space, the developers are following the design incentives and guidelines because it directly affects the total area for sale. And you wonder why the private residential landscape in Singapore looks so boring and similar.

 
I'm impressed.

Wheelock to cut prices for The Panorama
Agents say prices at re-launch this Sunday could be up to 10% lower than that at initial launch

Wheelock Properties's condominium project in Ang Mo Kio, The Panorama, is gearing up for a re-launch this Sunday, with agents saying that new prices could be as much as 10 per cent lower than those at the initial launch - PHOTO: WHEELOCK PROPERTIES

 

 


[sINGAPORE] Wheelock Properties's condominium project in Ang Mo Kio, The Panorama, is gearing up for a re-launch this Sunday, with agents saying that new prices could be as much as 10 per cent lower than those at the initial launch.
The re-pricing comes on the heels of earlier price cutting by its rivals to hasten sales amid mounting pressure from upcoming condo launches.
Balloting takes place on Sunday.
A one-bedder at The Panorama could start from $565,000, a two-bedder from $820,000 and a three-bedder from $1,175,000, according to marketing agents of the project.
These guided prices translate to $1,100-1,310 per square foot (psf), depending on the unit size. One-bedroom units at The Panorama are 431-474 square feet, two bedroom units are 678-700 sq ft and three bedroom units are in the 990-1,066 sq ft range.
Bigger units at The Panorama - four-bedders, five-bedders and penthouses - do not come under this "promotion" and are made available only on request from buyers.
The Panorama showflat re-opens today with a new one-bedroom show unit after a seven-week hiatus. Poor turnouts at the showflat after the first couple of weeks prompted the developer to temporarily close the showflat in mid-March for a revamp - barely three months from its January launch.
Some 58 units of the 698-unit project were moved in January at prices ranging from $1,234 psf to $1,591 psf, with a median price of $1,343 psf. Another four units were sold subsequently, with the last median price at $1,457 psf in March.
Also in District 20, CapitaLand relaunched its Bishan project, Sky Habitat, two weeks ago at lower prices of between $1,276 and $1,590 psf - around 10-15 per cent below the initial price range when it was launched two years ago. The tactical move apparently worked - more than 100 units have been sold since the re-launch.
CapitaLand is also dangling a 15 per cent discount for a key District 10 project, D'Leedon at Farrer Road, which is due to receive its temporary occupation permit (TOP) by year-end but has about 700 unsold units remaining. The one-bed plus study units start from $1.3 million, while a three-bedder starts from $2.2 million.
Tepid sales at The Panorama have prompted Wheelock to make a $110 million provision for the project, which pushed the group deeper in the red with a loss of $91.3 million for its fiscal fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2013, compared with a $30.8 million loss a year ago. For the full year, however, Wheelock posted a profit of $40 million, down nearly 37 per cent from the previous year.

if HDB really prata flipping policy to ban sporean to let out HDB whole unit and living in private condo
 
all hell break lose ... mass market condo can go jiak sai
 
agent can stop singing the song "just let out your hdb can finance your $1000psf condo liao" ... sibei shiok ah ...
 

Why condo units are shrinking 
 
PRIVATE developers are only meeting the growing demand for smaller condominium units ("Condo units shrinking: Report"; April 28).
I know of people who are holding on to their HDB flats and buying small private condo units either to rent out, or to live in while renting out their HDB units, hence turning the subsidised flats into "long-term cash cows".
 
As they are not selling their flats, they cannot pay a large quantum for the condo units, which leads to growing demand for "downsized" apartments.
 
Letting HDB flat owners rent out their units for profit, when they can afford private property, goes against the HDB's mission of providing affordable homes for the masses.
 
A subsidised flat that is being used to generate long-term profits is not really a home. The HDB should relook its policies in this regard.
 
A flat owner who buys private property should be subjected to an income assessment. If his income is above a certain cap set by the HDB, he should be made to sell his flat on the open market within a certain period of taking possession of the private property.
 
When owners have to dispose of their HDB flats upon upgrading to private property, they will have more cash and Central Provident Fund savings to purchase larger condo units, which in turn encourages developers to build them.
 
Another way would be to limit the timeframe that an HDB flat can be rented out, if the owner has a private property under his name and does not have a valid reason, such as being stationed overseas, for renting out the unit.
 
Current rules forbid a private property owner from purchasing even a resale HDB flat. The same rule should apply to HDB flat owners looking to buy private property.
 
This is a loophole many are exploiting, resulting in fewer resale HDB flats on the market. This deprives people who genuinely need public housing from owning such units, and encourages developers to build smaller condo units for HDB flat owners who want the best of both worlds.

"Senior citizens who sold off their old flats and moved to a studio apartment have made around S$200,000 each from the scheme.
 
This is the amount they gained after paying off outstanding loans for the old flat and fully paying for the new studio apartment.
 
National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan revealed this in his blog on Wednesday as he described the Studio Apartment scheme as one which has become "valuable in supporting seniors' retirement needs"."

balcony is easy money ... i have seen balcony as big as 1/2 children room size ...
 

 
my friend's condo at least 30% of the apartment is balcony.
Actually the layout is nice and practical inside. 1100+ sq feet but in reality the apartment feels like 800 sq feet.

Thanks for all the invaluable input.
 
I just looking at the asking prices at propertyguru. I assume theres some mark up for bargaining. Wont be approaching agent anytime soon.
 
The Castle Green part is a wild card man, can make or break the place.
 
But in my family's case, buyer or seller mart's will cut both ways. Ideal situation will be landed up 2016, condo down 2016. But I doubt so right. Usually all interlinked.

 
the NS expressway will run beside castle green. Though only Nuovo's land is taken by Govt for building purposes.

There is a surplus of units in the range of 20,000 to 30,000 from the last report I read. I personally think rental rates for suburban condominiums will drop eventually. Owners still holding out for better rental - good luck to them.

-25% from peak on a simplistic general overview, neither URA PPI nor property specific becos that would become meaningless already.
 
As for now, many have already dropped 15-20% as opposed to property agents saying that it wouldnt budge.

The units are really small these days. You need at least 150 sq ft to fit a queen size bed and have some left over space to manoeuvre around. Throw in a wardrobe with sliding doors and you can forget about having that small side table by the bed.

the good thing abt prop is its only a loss if u realize it. property goes up in long term, so essentially timing the mkt is whether u make a little or alot in short term, as long is no issue.

Those who bought a new condo and now developer lelong 10-15% off, haven't collect key already sitting a loss of few hundred K. Now that's what I call fire burning the pant.
 
 

 
This is subjective.
Also, hard to compare as no 2 units are exectly the same, unless you tell me there are owners now cutting losses selling 10%-15% down from what they bought their unit for (on top of taking the SD and SSD hit...)

the good thing abt prop is its only a loss if u realize it. property goes up in long term, so essentially timing the mkt is whether u make a little or alot in short term, as long is no issue.
 

 
Ai yo, these are just comforting words in my opinion. Who will be happy sitting at a loss, be it actual or paper? Incur more interest, and so what if property will recover in long term. How long? 10, 20, 30 yrs? I don't have that many 20 yrs to wait bro.

I hv always advised friends to go ahead and buy a property which they feel it is right in terms of affordabilty and personal preference as long as they are living in it and allows them to move on in life.
 
However an investment property is not the same.  It must be treated for what it is.  Profit or loss unrealized may just be on paper but there is no denying it represents lost opportunity or gained opportunity in real terms.
 
So if someone puts his money where his mouth is, correct or wrong i still respect him for being steady enough to make the decision .
 
Property isnt the most liquid instrument and at a retail level the buying and selling can be due to heavy emotions.
 
Go in with your eyes open plse.

An Example of Bad Property Advice
 

BAD ADVICE: “The monthly salary needed to get the most out of your property purchase is $10,000 to $12,000. I know, it’s not the easiest number to reach. But if you and your spouse can climb your way to this number, you’ll be in a prime position to afford a fantastic first home.”
 
BAD ADVICE: “According to ERA key spokesman Eugene Lim, depending on whether your income is fixed and your finances are well within the Total Debt Servicing Ration (TDSR) framework, you should be able to afford properties priced between $600,000 and $1.2 million.”
 
REALITY CHECK: Having a combined income of $10,000 to $12,000 for married couples does not justify a worthwhile reason to own an expensive suburban condominium as their first home. The purchase is more conspicuous spending than financial prudence.
Most married couples I know simply live from pay-check to pay-check servicing expensive home and car loans to keep up with society’s expectations. If one spouse loses his/her job, their financial position gets tougher with kids along the way.
 
Suburban condos that are priced lower than $1 million today are very small units, either the 1-bedders or 2-bedders, spaces that may be too small for a married couple who wants to start a family. Today’s $1.2 million condos do not get you much space either, only larger mortgage payments. Even at a low 1.5% interest rate for a 30-year loan tenure on a 20% down-payment, a couple would have to fork out $3,300 every month. With interest rates at 3.5%, the mortgage payments jump to $4,300 every month.
 
REALITY CHECK: Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) guidelines are meant to serve the business interests of a lending bank to a borrower. They are not meant to serve as financially prudent advice for buyers.
Most couples with a combined income of $10,000 to $12,000 would do a lot better financially buying less expensive re-sale HDB flats instead. They could use that savings to acquire financial freedom instead of paying through their noses for a cage in the sky.

 

BAD ADVICE: “What a 7% property drop would save you on ABSD – As you can see, falling property prices take the “bite” out of ABSD when it comes to purchasing a second or third property. You’ll even be able to save money, as the example above shows.” 
BAD ADVICE: “If property prices drop by 7% to 10% over the course of 2014, which everyone expects will happen – the pain of ABSD actually gets nullified.
 
REALITY CHECK: I have received many emails from readers telling me they have gotten a great price on a property. One particular lady approached me excitedly about discounted developer prices for a project called Sky Habitat in Bishan recently.

 

BAD ADVICE: “But there’s another way to purchase property in this buyer’s market – buying property from new launches through the progressive payment scheme.” 
BAD ADVICE: “In most new launches, units priced below $1 million are usually purchased quickly. That’s because payment for new developments is made progressively, allowing buyers who aren’t severely affected by tighter loan rules to buy smaller units with cash instead of financing larger units.” 
 
REALITY CHECK: If a buyer decides to buy a smaller unit because he/she is severely affected by tighter loan rules, it simply shows he/she may already be overstretching on finances, never mind a smaller unit.
 
This is the equivalent of saying,  “If I cannot afford a Ferrari, I will throw my money modifying a cheap Toyota Vios to look and sound like one.”
 
“If I cannot afford a second property in Singapore, I’ll just throw my money into a cheap overseas property I’ve never seen before.”
 
Many ‘experts’ have given advice that suggests buying with no or little money down is more important than buying a quality investment property. In your overall investment analysis, how you finance the property isn’t as important as buying one that will be a sound, long-term investment, i.e. quality properties that have positive cash-flow. Even if it’s 100% financed, a bad property is a bad property!
 
When you look at the noise out there, you will come across numerous suggestions on what you should do, and have to determine the legitimacy of every idea presented to you. It’s often not easy to differentiate between good advice and a bad advice, so take care before you act on it.

The low psf prices at Coco Palms are those low floor, poor facing or large patio units. All the better units are more than $1000psf.
 
The developers cut prices at developments such as Sky Habitat and The Panorama because they were not realistically priced in the first place. The resale freehold homes which represent good value have dropped by perhaps 3-5%, which is not even enough to cover the 10% ABSD.

Prices will drop but by 20% at most. If it drops by more than 20%, the government will need to intervene in order to ensure a stable and sustainable property market.

So how much has your property that you sold dropped by? Enough to cover ABSD, BSD and legal fees?

less commission also better than jiak sai !
 
agent need to be patient and skillful in talk-cock-sing-song
property price skyrocketed to the roof = make money
property price retract to sane level = also make money
 
unless there is economic crisis that is so catastrophic that $600k private condo also no one buy
there is no crisis now ... just buyer <> developer play tarik-tarik see who blink first and who blink more

Property agent rather earn less a bit on commission but have more transaction. What is 2% of a 2 million property- 40K. sell 1.8 million, 2 % is still $36K. 2 million maybe must put extra extra effort, 1.8 so much easier to sell. rather quickly see and move on.

CityDev struggling to sell its posh projects
 
 

Blame it on property cooling measures 
Things are getting uglier in Singapore's property market as City Development is finding out. The number of unsold projects for its high-end luxury segment remains a concern despite having stable sales in the mass-mid segments.
 
According to CIMB, in the rental market, recent media reports have suggested that South Beach Tower is in discussions with numerous occupiers that could potentially bring the pre-commitment to over 60%, though no signing rents have been disclosed. CIT previous guidance indicated that enquiries at about S$9 psf/mth have been received. 
 
Here's more:
 
During the quarter, due to the series of property cooling measures and the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR), sales of existing projects launched last year have slowed. 
 
For the rest of the year, further contributions from other pre-sold projects, including D’Nest (94% sold), Jewel @ Buangkok (83% sold) and Blossom Residences, are expected to support its earnings. The sale of the development project, Coco Palms – the last parcel of land within Pasir Ris Grove, will commence on 17 May 14.

Was reading my fave ST just now and it was reported that Until today, D'Leedon has one third unsold and sky habitat has two thirds unsold ......so basically Developers just tong.....but no matter how you tong, this market is going nowhere with such measures in place.
 
Good luck developers!
 
So the impact of rising rates will be far greater than we think.

 
 
reminder

No need black swan, already up lorry lah.
 
In fact its the opposite, we need a black swan event for the market to remain steady.
Everything simply points south, no question about it.
 
Its whether the "experts" dare to say it out loud or not.
 
Now they have with this still muted report.
 
The last paragraph, agent head still say , if drop 5 - 8% govt may remove CM....KNN they still dont get it.
The Govt wants it to drop 10% at least from current.

 
 
 
repeat

 
Once developers clear 60-70% stock, they are in the black already. Moreover, what used to take 3 years to sell in the past can be achieved within 6mths to a year now.
 
Hence less pressure for developers to lower prices beyond a cursory 5%
 
Mass mkt prices are tied to a certain extent to HDB prices. However, developers are reducing areas smaller and smaller to allow for PSF to continue on a marginal growth path.
 
I went to nine residences in yishun to kaypoh. Sales rate not very good. But I was surprised that all the 4 bedrooms were sold, and even 5 bedrooms were sold as well.. it was the smaller units that couldnt move.. occupier demand is still very strong it seemed.

 
 
 
wah this one confirm agent talk

This topic started only 20 Aug lah
We didnt predict a crash but there presents such a risk in the 12mth to 18mth horizon.
What we predict is a downward movement of prices across the general broad market and thats what happened. We further predict prices to drop further.

Buyers at the 695-unit Lakeville condominium showflat. -- ST PHOTO: NG SOR LUAN



BY CHERYL ONG
 

More buyers snapped up new private homes last month, as developers priced their units competitively to cope with the softening market.
Developers sold 745 new units last month, up 55.2 per cent from 480 in March, according to Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) figures released on Thursday.
This exceeded the 586 new homes being launched for sale in April, which was also a slight increase from the 724 units that were launched in March.
The top seller was MCL Land's 696-unit Lakeville in the Jurong Lake District, which moved 210 units in March at a median price of $1,318 per sq ft (psf).

i thk u shld know by now more than half the cars in showflat carparks belong to agents, & the "crowd" more than half are agents. They purposely make a small showflat n fill it up w agents n freeloader friends in plain clothes to create atmosphere of panic buying. Witnessed it many times over.
 
Same for car showrooms, half the "customers" are there just to eat the free food...

perhaps true for other agencies
 
but for my agency such tricks are not used. agent cars are not allowed to be parked at showflat 
 
i have never been asked by any project head to bring in friends or fillers to create panic buying, it is simply not necessary over the past 5 yrs. (maybe during the property lull period)
 
Of course, having a packed showflat doesnt mean high sales as most could be there to be kaypoh only

400psf? that's 25% off from launch price. I don't think there is such a big discount.
 
looking at the 474sf unit, the psf price still the same
 
624 sf units are studio with PES if i am not mistaken hence the $1,200 psf
 
anyway, what do i know? i'm even lower in the food chain than u.. above me got consultant, contractor, architect, project manager, developer, banks. Even walk-in kaypoh people also treat me like pest

Garmen - sold land off to developers

For the first time since the turn of the century, economic fortunes in the West and East have reversed, and Asian property investments are finally losing some of its glitter and shine.This view comes from Pacific Star Group’s recent 2014 Asian Property Outlook and Strategy (APOS) report, where the investment house notes how the composition of global growth has shifted from emerging economies to developed economies with stronger recovery momentum. Investors have also flocked to developed countries that offer attractive entry points Pacific Star Group views the reversal of growth prospects and investment activity is a natural progression as Asia comes of age. The Group expects sustainable growth in Asia to be driven by economic integration, urbanisation and rising incomes. Commenting on the report Lam Chern Woon, Pacific Star’s Vice President of Research and Strategic Planning, said: “We see little reason to alter our positive long-term prognosis of Asian real estate markets. “After an extended period of stellar growth, Asia has entered a consolidation phase in the near term. It is thus paramount to identify the growth opportunities before the markets pick up. Investors should actively lock themselves onto Asia’s long term growth potential while keeping an active lookout for opportunities that are in line with the trends playing out.” Pacific Star recommends a core satellite investment approach where core investments will track the region’s medium term growth prospects, while well-executed opportunistic investments will help bolster risk-adjusted returns. Asia may no longer be an investment green field, according to the company, but pockets of opportunities remain. In particular, the senior and youth population are rising in dominance. Opportunities in both segments are largely untapped and successful first movers will unlock a new paradigm of real estate investment in Asia. The report highlighted that the greying demographics in the region could see a greater number of retirement communities being developed to cater to this segment’s rising affluence and desire for an independent and active lifestyle. Such communities have been well received in the U.S. and Europe and the success could be replicated in Asia Pacific countries, where the concept is still relatively new. Youths in the new era are different from previous generations given rising affluence, educational standards and exposure to globalization and technology. Retailers should adopt a careful mix of online marketing strategies, and focus on designer and new-to-market brands to engage this segment. Developers can meet the desire for convenience, differentiation and experience by providing innovative mixed-use developments while keeping the quantum affordable. Using its Property Drivers Framework, which seeks to establish the attractiveness of real estate  sectors across Asia by scoring them along various macroeconomic and real estate indicators. Pacific Star’s top recommendations for strategic investments include: Quality office assets in Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo Besides having strong institutions, these markets are undergoing a cyclical recovery and face limited new supply in the near term. Retail assets in Hong Kong, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur International retailers will be more selective and favour established retail destinations like Hong Kong and Singapore. Kuala Lumpur, on the other hand, should benefit from continued retail interest in view of its positive demographics and resilient domestic spending. The retail pipeline in China is large, but mismanaged assets in good locations present great repositioning opportunities. Residential markets in Tokyo, Singapore and Hong Kong In the residential sector, Tokyo’s housing market is past the worst and new opportunities could surface in Singapore and Hong Kong, given strong latent demand. Mass housing development remains as a viable play given the wave of urbanization across cities.

When you toggle the area and floor range, can more or less tell its PES units.
 
They tend to bunch up together even when doing a cursory glance.

Trends in the last few decades have shown that economic cycles are more frequent and last shorter. And the impact concentration is regional (with varying spill over effects, extent of which depends on the scale of the downturn). As such, more are getting bolder in their spendings and plan to have enough to tide over a few years of downturn as compared to previously, when the duration of impact can be quite many years. Some argue that that's how modern economy work now. Others argue that these had been small ripples leading to the big bubble burst. As far as Sg property is concerned, the price increase over the last 5-10years was fueled by rapid and huge influx of foreigners. From 2.6m in the late 90s/early 2000s to now, close to 6m. That more than double. Do we expect the property price and population to grow like it did in the last 10 years? Is there a possibility of a market crash? Quite unthinkable for Sg. Whether you wish for the crash to happen or not, the govt will use all means to prevent it from happening. Property price drop too much, Banks get hit hard and ultimately the currency and the country. If they can help it, they will want it to keep going up, allowing occassional slight and tiny drops.

Tell it to the developers who are all a bit bruised from recent double digit percentage price cuts.
 
From a month of low sales to a month of better sales purely becos of price cut is normal.  If they cut more, they sell more. Simple.  And as the demand thins out, its becomes more and more a case of early bird catches the worm.
 
And idiots are still comparing no. of units sold between past and present as though every unit is exactly the same size in the same area.  
 
Come on!

That I agree wholeheartedly. When that tsunami supply arrives, there'll be no where to hide. 
 
After which, interest rates increases will follow but I feel this factor will be muted compared the supply issue. Central banks will move up interest rates in a synchronised manner.

a very good move for 1 day sale,  i must say 
 
Coco Palms, a joint venture between CDL and Hong Realty (Pte) Ltd, sold about 490 units at an average price of $980 per square foot (psf) as at 3pm yesterday. The number of units sold represents 82 per cent of the 600 units available at the weekend launch, or 52 per cent of the 944 units in the entire development.

Falls in landed home prices 'may ease'Short supply of such properties likely to cushion price decreases: AnalystsPublished on May 12, 2014 1:40 AMBy Melissa TanA SEVERELY limited supply of landed homes may help their prices hold up better this year compared with condominiums.Analysts say although landed home prices have fallen over the past few quarters owing to generally poor market sentiment, the segment's slowdown could ease off this year and even bottom out.They tip landed home prices to fall by 2 to 6 per cent this year, less than the 5 to 8 per cent tumble predicted for the overall private property market."Genuine landed home buyers could come back in the second half of this year as prices bottom out," said Mr Jeffrey Hong, chief executive of real estate firm GPS Alliance. "The current situation offers them a window of opportunity to get into the market."Mr Hong said that buyers may be able to pick up bargains in suburban areas such as Bukit Batok, Loyang, Jurong and Sembawang.Although landed home prices fell in tandem with the overall housing market in the first quarter this year, their decline was gentler.Landed home prices slid 0.7 per cent in January until March from the preceding quarter, the Urban Redevelopment Authority said last month. Overall, private home prices dropped 1.3 per cent in the same period.The decline in landed home prices in the first quarter was also smaller than their 1 per cent fall in the fourth quarter last year.Analysts said that the scarcity of landed homes in Singapore would likely cushion their price decreases.Terraced houses, in particular, may see more demand since their overall prices tend to be lower than those of semi-detached houses or bungalows, they added.SLP International research head Nicholas Mak noted that landed homes make up a mere 3.2 per cent of the estimated 76,300 private homes that are expected to be completed between this year and 2017."This indicates that the prices of landed homes could increase rapidly again when property prices recover in the future."Mr Hong also noted that some landed properties could be acquired for redevelopment into cluster housing or apartments, meaning that landed housing could get rarer.Government land sale sites zoned for landed housing are very rare, he added.Mr Mak observed that landed home prices have historically tended to be "more robust" than non-landed home prices.Their prices climbed more compared with that of non-landed homes during the property market boom from the second quarter of 2009 to the middle of last year, he said."The strong price growth of landed homes was partly driven by the arrival of new rich immigrants," Mr Mak said."Some of them became Singapore citizens which qualified them to buy landed homes."The boom ended after tough home loan restrictions were imposed in June last year, capping the sum that buyers could borrow to buy property.But even after that, landed home prices fell less than non-landed home prices from October last year to March this year, Mr Mak said.Analysts noted, however, that landed home rentals could weaken further."Landed homes typically do not command a good rental yield (unlike) most condos," Mr Hong said.He tips that rents could fall 5 to 8 per cent this year.

Excellent job.
You hv proven again what all car dealers and property agents are about, wyfitms.  
 
Go on thinking that every buyer is an idiot, attracted purely by the percentage of discount and not the actual price they are paying
Go on treating your clients as fools, there are many but the number is shrinking.
 
Well done! Just dont forget to put your money where your mouth is.
Otherwise how are you going to participate .
Surely not by plain talking, right?

i think u actually give too much credit to salesman like me. I'm not qualified to give any advice, nor do i have any power to give discount or set the marketing strategy. 
 
i'm just here to open the door and help buyers to photocopy NRIC and collect their cheques then shake their hands and congratulate them

 S'pore third as City of Opportunity

 

May 20, 2014 
 
Singapore has been ranked third – up four positions from last year – in PwC’s sixth edition of its Cities of Opportunity report.
 
For the first time, London posted the highest score in the 30 cities studied by PwC. The U.K. capital is the only city to finish first in three of the 10 indicators - economic clout, city gateway and technology readiness, a category it ties with Seoul - and was followed by New York and Singapore. 
 
The study showed that top ranked cities embody the energy, opportunity and hope that draw people to city life. High performing cities also find the right balance between social and economic strengths in a world being quickly shaped by inescapable global trends.
 
Moving up four spots from the last edition, Singapore took third place overall and finishes first in two indicators - ease of doing business and transportation and infrastructure. 
 
Despite not having a top rank in any indicator, New York continues to show strong consistency across most of the categories. Rounding out the top five cities are Toronto and San Francisco.
 
“Changing demographics, shifts in economic power and the concepts of urbanization being realised are the forces taking the world in a new direction,” said Bob Moritz, PwC's U.S. Chairman and Senior Partner. 
 
“Cities are increasingly competing for talent and are working hard to capture the promise of growth from the many opportunities in today’s rapidly changing world. As a result, people are looking for more potential for personal opportunity while demanding critical elements to increase quality of life. It’s the top ranking cities in this year’s study that are demonstrating the foresight that is needed to adapt, stay competitive and thrive for a sustainable positive future."
 
Cities of Opportunity 6 also highlighted the increasing competitiveness of emerging cities across several key indicators. Beijing, which ranked 19th, finishes in the top three in both the city gateway and economic clout categories, while Seoul is top in technology readiness and is the only emerging city to reach the top 10 in the ease of doing business indicator. Seoul and Buenos Aires also break into the top three for transportation and infrastructure, while Johannesburg is in the top three for cost.
 
The full report is available at http://www.pwc.com/cities. 
 
The methodology for Cities of Opportunity is based on publicly available data, using three main sources: global multilateral development organisations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund; national statistics organisations, such as National Statistics in the UK and the Census Bureau in the U.S.; and commercial data providers. The data was collected during the third and fourth quarters of 2013. Besides adding Jakarta, Nairobi, and Rio de Janeiro to the study, PwC also replaced Abu Dhabi with Dubai which brought the study to 30 cities total, the largest to date. The scoring methodology was developed to facilitate transparency and simplicity for readers, as well as comparability across cities.

 	Singapore Home Sales at Five-Month High Amid Declining Property Prices

By M Rochan May 15, 2014 12:54 BST

 
 



A file photograph of a residential condominium project in Singapore.Reuters


Home sales in Singapore, Asia's second-most expensive housing market, struck a five-month high in April amid declining property prices, according to government data.
Home sales in April rose to 745 units, the highest since 1,271 in November 2013, according to data from Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).
Home sales jumped 55% over March 2014 but dropped 46% when compared to April 2013's figures, data showed on 15 May.
Realty firms managed to sell more than the 586 units marketed, as home buyers rushed to make bookings amid falling prices.
"It's an improvement as developers sold more units than they launched last month," said Nicholas Mak, an executive director at SLP International Property Consultants in Singapore.
"That's a good sign because it shows they are cutting their inventory of unsold units." Mak told Bloomberg.
Prices of private residential properties fell by 1.3% in the first three months of 2014, following a 0.9% dip in the preceding quarter, URA data showed on 25 April.
Rental Discrimination
Several landlords in Singapore refuse to rent homes to mainland Chinese and Indians and the so-called rental discrimination has reportedly become a rising menace in the small but wealthy city-state.
The issue appears more common with less expensive properties and on property rental sites where content is posted directly by users, the Online Citizen reported.
Singapore is an ethnically diverse nation, comprising 74% Chinese, 13% Malay, 9% Indian and 3% from other groups, according to official data.
Nine out of 10 Singaporean households own their homes, according to government data. As such, a sizeable chunk of renters are foreigners.
Most Expensive City
Singapore has become the most expensive city in the world to live in following rise in house prices after an influx of foreign workers boosted the island's wealth and demand for homes.
According to a February Economist Intelligence Unit report, entitled The Worldwide Cost of Living Survey, a strengthening of the Singaporean dollar also pushed the country to pole position as the expansion of the republic's financial industry contributed to the country's wealth.

Not a single resale transaction this year! Market dead man.
 
Or is everyone saving bullets to buy new? even if price is 30% more?   
 
  Slow resale activity in Tiong BahruShare
 

With buyers looking forward to Keppel Land’s upcoming 500-unit condominium along Kim Tian Road in Tiong Bahru, there was not a single resale transaction recorded at the nearby existing condominiums since the start of the year.According to media reports, the 99-year leasehold Highline Residences is expected to be launched in late June, with prices ranging from $1,700 to $1,900 psf.It will be next to three completed developments -- Central Green, Regency Suites and Twin Regency, where there has been an absence of resale activities in the past few months, based on caveats submitted to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).Completed in 1995, the 412-unit Central Green saw its most recent resale transaction in December 2013, when a 1,292 sq ft unit was sold for $1.73 million ($1,339 psf). Average rents at the 99-year leasehold project reached $4.05 psf per month in the last six months.As for the Regency Suites, its latest resale deal was in August 2013, when a 980 sq ft unit was sold for $1.63 million ($1,664 psf). Units at the 84-unit freehold project also yield a higher average rent of $4.82 psf per month.Finally, the 234-unit Twin Regency witnessed its most recent resale activity in July 2013, when a 1,227 sq ft unit was transacted for $2.15 million ($1,752 psf). The freehold project also has the highest average rent of $5.18 psf compared to the other two.Meanwhile, the outlook for property in Tiong Bahru appears promising due to its scarce supply of new homes and convenient city fringe location, according to experts. Expatriates also find the area appealing thanks to its vibrancy.Ong Kah Seng Research Director at R'ST, said, “The character of Tiong Bahru is very unique, with a mix of older and new apartments, eateries, shops and some old-world charm, setting it apart from areas that are too similar in housing forms.”However, resale prices of the newer completed condos there could drop to about $1,550 psf by year-end, given the sluggish resale market, he added.Image: Tiong Bahru (Source: Wikimedia Commons/User: Sengkang)

I ask because I pass by The Interlace regularly in the evenings and it still seems to be a ghost town, very few lights on. Is this the norm nowadays with new TOPs?

 
Looking at the data; The Interlace project total got 1040 units... but the total caveat lodged is only 307...
 
so there are about 700+ units unsold...
 
Looking at their website, the developer start offering renting out as well as lowering the selling price.
 
I heard that many local don like the design of it...

http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/project/knox-view-2105 (this one had a recent transaction for 4th floor, of a 5 storey bldg, 816psf for 2200sqft total 1.8mil)
 
well i've seen penthouse in katong go for slightly less than $1000psf (but 4000sqft)
 
if you look at some of the older bldgs in katong, might be able to hit 1000psf soon enough.

http://www.straitstimes.com/archive/...orrow-20140510Lower prices at Panorama relaunch tomorrowAgents say prices could be 14% lower than at January's initial launchPublished on May 10, 2014 1:11 AMBy Melissa TanTHE Panorama condominium in Ang Mo Kio goes back on sale tomorrow at a discount, the latest in a recent string of relaunches.The new prices could be up to 14 per cent lower than at the initial launch in January, according to marketing agents.Consultants said more projects could be put back on the market at lower prices in the coming months as some developers may have to sell units to pay for the project's construction.Developers may also be encouraged to do so because recent condo repricings by their rivals have managed to move a decent number of units, they noted.At The Panorama's relaunch tomorrow, prices for a one-bedder could start at $565,000 in total, according to marketing agents.This is about 14 per cent below the lowest price paid for the smallest one-bedder in January - $658,670 for a 431 sq ft unit.A two-bedder could start at $820,000 and a three-bedder $1,175,000. New prices for larger units such as four- and five-bedders and penthouses were not advertised.The new prices work out to a range of $1,100 to $1,310 per sq ft (psf), lower than the previous average of $1,366 psf, according to caveats lodged with the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).The 99-year leasehold project has sold poorly, partly because home loan curbs set last year have made it tough for buyers to afford more expensive units.The developer, Wheelock Properties, moved 58 units in January at a median price of $1,343 per sq ft - just 8 per cent of the 698 units available. It had sold only 57 units in total by end-March, going by the latest available URA data, indicating that some units had been returned by their buyers.Wheelock said in its first-quarter results yesterday that it had sold 56 units at $1,365 psf. It did not specify the average price.The slow take-up had prompted Wheelock to write off $110 million for the project, which sent it into the red for the three months to Dec 31 last year.Wheelock had paid $550 million for the land in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 2, which works out to $790 psf per plot ratio (ppr) for the nearly 1.85ha site - far higher than the $560 and $650 psf ppr analysts had expected.Consultants yesterday said more condo relaunches could be on the horizon, with likely candidates being projects that have moved fewer than half their units."Developers generally need to get some cashflow so they don't have to dig into their own pockets to carry on the development," said CBRE research head Desmond Sim. But he noted that the threshold at which developers would need this extra cash depends on their profit margins from the project and the complexity of the construction.OrangeTee research head Christine Li said "very good results" from recent condo repricings may also entice other developers to relaunch their projects.The 75-unit freehold Hallmark Residences in Bukit Timah, for instance, managed to sell 26 units in February and a further 13 in March after its developer, MCL Land, cut prices.CapitaLand's 509-unit Sky Habitat project in Bishan sold 80 units the day it relaunched last month, at prices about 10 to 15 per cent lower than at its initial launch two years ago.Projects launched last year that have sold fewer than half of their units so far include Hillion Residences in Bukit Panjang, Kingsford's Hillview Peak in Bukit Batok, Vue 8 Residence in Pasir Ris and The Glades in Tanah Merah.melissat@sph.com.sg

Why they like to say "could be" "maybe" when it is already for sure that prices WILL BE cut.

http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/project/knox-view-2105 (this one had a recent transaction for 4th floor, of a 5 storey bldg, 816psf for 2200sqft total 1.8mil)
 
well i've seen penthouse in katong go for slightly less than $1000psf (but 4000sqft)
 
if you look at some of the older bldgs in katong, might be able to hit 1000psf soon enough.

because roof terrace etc is free money for developer.
 
there's many CCR penthouse with empty roof. i saw quite a few in river valley area. also believe hijaun has this problem, as well as helios, just to name a few.
 
the worse is those with void area ... they put in small print that the area is considered double square footage due to "high ceiling" which is garbage as well lah.
 
developers got too many tricks up their sleeves lah .. need to be extra careful ... worse is when agents themselves dont know ...
 
before i bought my place, gave a cheque for another place and the agent confirm to me the void area was not counted (even when i was skeptical). next day the agent sheepishly return cheque when they did their homework as the area was short 10% (due to the f**king void area). i told them if give 10% discount i can continue with the deal, but the developer said no way ... so i just ask for my $ back ..

Lower prices at Panorama relaunch tomorrow
 
Agents say prices could be 14% lower than at January's initial launch
 
Published on May 10, 2014 1:11 AM
 
By Melissa Tan
 
 
THE Panorama condominium in Ang Mo Kio goes back on sale tomorrow at a discount, the latest in a recent string of relaunches.
 
The new prices could be up to 14 per cent lower than at the initial launch in January, according to marketing agents.
 
Consultants said more projects could be put back on the market at lower prices in the coming months as some developers may have to sell units to pay for the project's construction.
 
Developers may also be encouraged to do so because recent condo repricings by their rivals have managed to move a decent number of units, they noted.
 
At The Panorama's relaunch tomorrow, prices for a one-bedder could start at $565,000 in total, according to marketing agents.
 
This is about 14 per cent below the lowest price paid for the smallest one-bedder in January - $658,670 for a 431 sq ft unit.
 
A two-bedder could start at $820,000 and a three-bedder $1,175,000. New prices for larger units such as four- and five-bedders and penthouses were not advertised.
 
The new prices work out to a range of $1,100 to $1,310 per sq ft (psf), lower than the previous average of $1,366 psf, according to caveats lodged with the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).
 
The 99-year leasehold project has sold poorly, partly because home loan curbs set last year have made it tough for buyers to afford more expensive units.
 
The developer, Wheelock Properties, moved 58 units in January at a median price of $1,343 per sq ft - just 8 per cent of the 698 units available. It had sold only 57 units in total by end-March, going by the latest available URA data, indicating that some units had been returned by their buyers.
 
Wheelock said in its first-quarter results yesterday that it had sold 56 units at $1,365 psf. It did not specify the average price.
 
The slow take-up had prompted Wheelock to write off $110 million for the project, which sent it into the red for the three months to Dec 31 last year.
 
Wheelock had paid $550 million for the land in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 2, which works out to $790 psf per plot ratio (ppr) for the nearly 1.85ha site - far higher than the $560 and $650 psf ppr analysts had expected.
 
Consultants yesterday said more condo relaunches could be on the horizon, with likely candidates being projects that have moved fewer than half their units.
 
"Developers generally need to get some cashflow so they don't have to dig into their own pockets to carry on the development," said CBRE research head Desmond Sim. But he noted that the threshold at which developers would need this extra cash depends on their profit margins from the project and the complexity of the construction.
 
OrangeTee research head Christine Li said "very good results" from recent condo repricings may also entice other developers to relaunch their projects.
 
The 75-unit freehold Hallmark Residences in Bukit Timah, for instance, managed to sell 26 units in February and a further 13 in March after its developer, MCL Land, cut prices.
 
CapitaLand's 509-unit Sky Habitat project in Bishan sold 80 units the day it relaunched last month, at prices about 10 to 15 per cent lower than at its initial launch two years ago.
 
Projects launched last year that have sold fewer than half of their units so far include Hillion Residences in Bukit Panjang, Kingsford's Hillview Peak in Bukit Batok, Vue 8 Residence in Pasir Ris and The Glades in Tanah Merah.

USA xerox so much paper...credit will still find its way to where it's needed in one form or another.
 
Just need sentiment to get a knockout sucker punch. Then all will recoil like when you knock on a tray of tubifex worms.

I would do the same if i were a developer.
Whoever launches quicker and earlier and lowers prices first will clear his inventory first allowing buffer for the next course of action.
 
This round down 10-15% also cannot sell all for sure.
Next round down another 10% from this round still cannot sell all
So my estimation of a good scenario using skyhabitat as example is for the price to drop to at least $1100psf before they can manage to sell remaining 230units.  
$1600psf to $1100psf is $500psf.  So the early buyers, almost lost their pants already.
 
For the newer big projects which started out at around $1300psf.  Expect that to go under $1000psf or they wont be able to clear all "stock"
 
By the way, D'leedon still how much % unsold?

Any insights on commercial property? Seems like most of the new B1 industrial are >80% vacant for half a year or so, like oxley 1 & 2, a-z building, commerze@irving, novelty biz centre, yet price no drop, think most being held by investors.

Yup. Just need some unforseen situation to catch the already fragile sentiment offguard then it's ho say liao. 
 
I think for DLeedon, CapL got rid of the lousier units at discounted prices.
 
I got to know bec there was so much chatter on the Dleedon thread in the condoforum so i kaypoh see see look look. 
 
I got no money to buy second property,  let alone a D9/10/11 property.

just paper losses only, same as paper gain, only realized when u sell.
 
Early batch can console themselves that they paid higher for their choice units. Now only leftovers for others to nibble

quantum low mah
 
singaporean investors are cash rich. All hoping to hold out and sell for 20% higher. If they can get their target price in 10 yrs time, already better than putting money into fixed D
 
even if they only lease the unit out for $0.50 psf for people to dump their barang barang

1..Paper loss is different from paper gain.Paper loss can kill, paper gain cannot and doesnt.
 
2.  As you said, console is the word.  Simi choice units?  Are you now saying that all choice units are launched in 1st phase?  Agent always say every phase also have choice units lah.  Or are you twisting words now ?  Moreover some development havent even sold 10% yet.
 
3. Duration of the investment makes a hell lot of difference. For some people , cannot lease out at minimum $4psf means cashflow screwed.  Cashflow screwed means KNNBCCB for some.  Not all are truly cash rich.  Cash rich means one can buy a few units in cash but choose to buy only one and have no impact when job is lost.  Quantum low for low cash people mostly.  Even if truly cash rich, will face opportunity loss still.
 
 
Not recognising where the market is and is heading, makes you sound like the "expert" property agent that everyone knows.   So i would sincerely advise you not to prata anymore. Unless of course you truly think that the market is always up and trouble free.

if paper loss can kill, cashflow screwed can die, then simply means that the buyer has over extended himself. No one points a gun at the buyer to buy. Media has been warning about the impending supply and PAP has implemented so many CM to warn investors.
 
Agents are just a convenient scapegoat lah. When investor huat from the property, do they credit agents? But when people get burnt, all will start cursing and swearing at agents.
 
Most agents like to prata, but come on.. if you have enough money to buy a property, you are definitely not some kiddo frog in the well. 90% of the buyers i come across already have their own strong belief in the market even before i open my mouth. And they seldom change their view no matter what an agent says. If they think the market is down, they will not buy. If they think the market will be up, they will buy. Simple as that. 
 
i'm no expert, just a salesperson. if i am so expert, i would be in other jobs like table wiping liao

if can, find me at $0.60 also can! i'll re-rent to someone at $1.00 and pocket the difference 
 
been doing this for a while and my $0.02 is ... the big boys (the ones you should worry about) will tell you the same thing .. they rather keep vacant than to lower the rent, since that affects the valuation as well. better to use the previous rent as a benchmark for valuation than to give a new low rent.

quick question .. $2M property ... ABSD 7% = $140K cash
should whack now or wait for ABSD to be lifted ... $140K for ABSD is very shiong leh
 
if ABSD is lifted, very sure all kancheong spider will cheong to showroom and developer raise $psf or less discount
eventually, $2M property might cost more than $2.14M (incl ABSD)?
 
so, how?

i dont do rental sorry
 
if u want, just search for the newly TOP ones.. as someone mentioned, oxley bizhub etc are all 80% vacant now.
 
likely u will be able to find one investor who is desperate enough to rent to you  

quick question ...
 
$2M property ... ABSD 7% = $140K cash
 
if price drop to sane level of $psf
should whack now or wait for ABSD to be lifted
$140K for ABSD is very shiong leh
 
if ABSD is lifted, kancheong spider all cheong and $psf rise ... so the $2M property might goes up
 
so, how?

 
how now brown cow?
 
then govt implement ABSD again lah!

edit: sorry reply is for wt_know
 
just calculate the absd into your return lo ... what else can you do. everyone is surely thinking along the same lines as you ... even those multi  millionaires cant bear to part with extra 7% for the prime residential they want to buy. so all cheong together la ...
 
if you are financially stable and the yield is decent, should be ok to consider. but market is still soft and you can probably squeeze the seller (or wait for a desperate enough seller)

I don't suppose that's a professional advice coming from you right? If they are so desperate, they would already lower their asking price already.

Not desperate, just smart.  There is 5 years of industrial supply in the pipeline, it can only get worse.  Better secure a lease or eat air for a few years.

if paper loss can kill, cashflow screwed can die, then simply means that the buyer has over extended himself. No one points a gun at the buyer to buy. Media has been warning about the impending supply and PAP has implemented so many CM to warn investors.
 
Agents are just a convenient scapegoat lah. When investor huat from the property, do they credit agents? But when people get burnt, all will start cursing and swearing at agents.
 
Most agents like to prata, but come on.. if you have enough money to buy a property, you are definitely not some kiddo frog in the well. 90% of the buyers i come across already have their own strong belief in the market even before i open my mouth. And they seldom change their view no matter what an agent says. If they think the market is down, they will not buy. If they think the market will be up, they will buy. Simple as that. 
 
i'm no expert, just a salesperson. if i am so expert, i would be in other jobs like table wiping liao

I don't suppose that's a professional advice coming from you right? If they are so desperate, they would already lower their asking price already.
 
some have started to lower, but as i have said, the market is not in panic mode yet so majority adopting a wait and see first 
 
if u knock on enough doors, you would probably find someone willing to do business at a good price

private condo dual key is not subjected to the rule living with parent or grandparent ... heng ah 
 
dual-key vs penthouse unit ... whichone better?
 
i like the idea of buying 4rooms dual-key = 1 3bedder + 1 studio
1 studio = 1 MM to let out
2 residences for 1 stamp duty ... huat ah!
just walk to next door to collect rent ... wahahaha
 
what projects got dual-key unsold? 
hopefully can wait for the right time to lowball
 

Housing market gets distorted in favor of dual-key flats.
Singaporeans have found a way to sneak around the infamous additoinal buyer's stamp duty by getting two apartments for the price and tax of one. This concept, called dual-key aparment, has become popular among buyers who can get an apartment with 2 residences for the stamp duty of one unit, thereby avoiding the additional 15% of a second proeprty.
 
According to research done by Knight Frank,an amazing 1 in 13 units launched in 2013 was a dual-key unit, up from just 3.5% in 2011and this is almost entirely due to the tax factor. This is an interesting distoriton of Singapore's property market in jsut a short amount of time and could have long-term lingering impacts with potentially seriuos consquences.
 
Dual-key apartments were originally designed so that family units could stay together and enoy some privacy. but with this new super-investor class of residence, the original purpose is being perverted.
 
Now, the family is being forced to share spaces with other people.
"With a total of 330 newly-launched dual-key unts in 2011, the number has risen by approximately 1.5 times to 840 units in 2013. This increase is mostly contributed by large-scale private residental developments, as the EC sector experiences a gradual decline in the number of newly-launched dual-key units," Knight Frank said in its research.

yes, dual key condo is under 1 title deed
dual key = dual door = dual unit but 1 deed = 1 absd
you can use it as 1 property and also can use it as 2 property ... 1 = live + 1 = let out
dual key is sibei brilliant ... 
for limited ca$h investor ... instead of buy 1 condo to live + 1 MM to let out ... why not dual key
for limited ca$h investor ... let out hdb, buy condo dual key ... let out the studio unit ... hdb rent + stuido rent = condo loan auto-servicing ... huat ah!

Its not the same , dual key vs two seperate units.
One cent money, one cent good.
 
When it comes to liquidating and cutting up the pie, you can sell one seperate unit for cash and keep one to stay, with dual key, its all or nothing.
 
So while it is a saving on the duties, there presents its own limitations.

almost reaching "have you cake and eat it"
 
for example, a family sell their hdb and upgrade to private condo (this is a typical scenario)
why not a dual-key condo
achieve the 5C dream and yet can let out the studio unit to collect rent ...

thats what i was thinking ... it's not really saving on stamp duty or absd because it's essentially 1 unit split into 2. it was sold as 1 title, so there's no benefit to saying you are "Saving" on the second absd because that is misleading the un-informed buyer. the benefit that is being touted does not technically exist. 
 
of all things, i sure as hell wouldnt want to stay in an apartment next to my tenant. everytime there is a small issue, they will knock on the door and say toilet broken, this broken, that broken. no thanks man. it's literally bringing work home when the apartment starts aging. (maybe i've become jaded after dealing with so many residential tenants ... )
 
lastly - if you rent out the other half and establish a baseline rental ... your own property tax will be adjusted upwards anyway. IRAS is not stupid ..

you have summarized the essence of today's market
 
having your cake and eat it. How to continue supporting high psf price?
 
By making units smaller
 
That way, developers happy, buyers also happy (thinking price is now affordable when in fact area has shrunk 20%)

Perhaps but absolutely twisting and misconstruing in response to the original context.
 
For example:  
 
A:  blue and red  are the same color
B:  no, blue and red are clearly different,  becos etc......
A:  if blue and red are different, it means that another color has been added in to make it different
Already warn the person not to add another color to make it different.  If you know how to paint, surely blue or red wont make a difference.    
 
So at the end of the day are blue and red really the same color? 
Which is the original question to answer.
 
Or has A twisted the whole context to make it sound logical in his favor?

Sp4wn is talking about the treatment of the unit as owner occupied or otherwise, or the proportion of each in question, i believe.  
 
Owner occupied properties are taxed at a much lower rate than non owner occupied properties.

actually, it has everything to do with 1 unit .. (i think .. i dont know how dual key works exactly)
 
imagine this is your only property ..
you use half and you rent out half
because it is 1 property - do you get the owner occupier rate, or the 10% annual value rate?
(now do you see where i'm coming from?)

To meet the housing needs of Singaporeans, HDB today launched 6,454 flats for sale under its May Build-to-Order (BTO) and Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercise.Some 3,071 BTO flats over four projects in the non-mature estates of Bukit Batok and Woodlands were offered together with 3,383 balance flats.This is the third BTO launch in 2014 and brings the total number of BTO flats and balance flats offered for sale this year to 13,090 units.Although no studio apartments were made available in this BTO exercise, a wide range of two- to five-room flats and 3Gen flats are being offered to first-timers, second-timers, multi-generation families and singles. Prices start from $12,000 for a two-room in Marsiling Greenview, inclusive of grants.The balance flats comprise studio apartments, two- to five-room and executive flats which are reserved for families.Applications will close on 28 May and the next BTO launch will take place in July 2014.In July, HDB will offer 3,810 BTO flats in Punggol, Sembawang, Toa Payoh, Woodlands and Yishun.

Why prices will not crash: CIMB
 
Singapore property prices are likely to decline - but not crash - by between 10 percent to 15 percent according to CIMB's latest Cost of Living survey, published today.Answering the question "Will my home price crash?" the report noted that government policy and buyers' expectations are reasons for a weak residential property market, not unaffordable property prices.

 
CIMB said that property buyers are the clear winners in this cycle, with healthy household balance sheets and time on their side. Developers that took the initiative to court buyers with lower prices, have achieved healthy take-up rates thus far. This should bring on a gradual property price decline, not a crash. We expect a 10-15 percent correction over 2014-15.

Why people wish to have big crash? Big crash mean many people lost jobs, businesses out, homeless increasing and bankruptcy on the roll
 
 
Why it has to be a big crash? A decline would be more suitable. Moreover as long as economy is healthy, a crash is harder to realize. People with tons of cash does pray property crash big big so that they can use this crisis as opportunity to increase their wealth. Selfish but true

In any case, I'd venture a guess that owner occupier rates apply across the entierty of the property as long as you stay there regardless of if you derive an income from it. IRAS gets their kicks from taxing the rental via income tax.

govt see the $ coming from your rental. Don't think they will let it slip away from their taxation  
Anyway they can tax via income tax. Property tax forgo. Maybe it's too complicated to administer.
Dual key is a very small percentage of the market anyway.

dont worry bro .. like i said, im as confused as anyone else because i've never dealt with dual key units.
 
just to clear things up in a concise way -
 
income tax should be as per normal for collection of rental (i think we are on the same page here)
property tax is a guess since we cant be sure whether it is taxed as owner occupied / tenanted / hybrid of both. (this is the contention)
 
Since IRAS will get from income tax and property tax, it is unclear how they will deal with these units. the crux of my argument was that agents shouldnt be saying the taxation is owner occupied if nobody is certain ... sorry for going all over the place!

I never said crash either.
I said consistent drop over next two years before bottoming out 2016-17 all else unchange.
So we have seen experts say drop by 0-5% then shift to 5-10%, now 10-15% drop.

CAPTION 




SINGAPORE: Two plots of land for executive condominium (EC) development at Yishun Street 51 have attracted a healthy number of bids from developers at the close of tender on Thursday.
The two adjacent plots were put up for sale under the batch tender closing system, which is aimed at ensuring more prudent bids from developers.
According to the Housing and Development Board, one plot attracted six bids.
The top bid came in jointly from Verwood Holdings and TID Residential at S$178.5 million.
Verwood is a wholly-owned subsidiary of City Developments, and TID Residential is a wholly-owned subsidiary of TID Pte Ltd. 
The site measures about 17,940 square metres and is expected to yield 490 units.
There were eight bids for the other plot, with JBE Holdings placing the top bid of S$184.1 million.
The plot has a size of about 18,260 square metres and is expected to yield 520 units.
Desmond Sim, head of CBRE Research (Singapore), said in a statement that "developers are still hungry for land. The relatively small total quantum for the two sites has enticed a spectrum of developers, big and small, to place competitive bids".
He also noted that the area is fast becoming an enclave of private developments in an established housing estate. 
In a statement on Thursday, CDL said that if awarded the site, it will explore a mid-rise EC development of between 12 to 13 storeys with approximately 480 units.
In January this year, CDL and TID also successfully tendered for an EC land parcel at Canberra Drive.

How much is the difference?
If you like the place so much and can write off the difference then buy it and move on lah.
 
Is this your matrimonial home?
Or is it investment property?
 
The considerations are different. Becos one is more about sentiment and the other is more about money.

if own stay and u really like the place and u can afford it, id say go ahead. its better to buy smt you like even if a bit ex, rather than to settle for second best.
 
tell the seller to meet halfway, or issue the 1% at your price (or slightly higher) and write your terms behind (ie to be banked in on XXXX date before 5pm for deal to confirm). once you give a time limit normally seller will know u r serious and u will make them kancheong because they got a cold hard offer in hand =)
 
good luck!!

Look its not a house, right?
If its a house then i can understand if you say its perfect etc etc...becos every house is different even if on the same street.
 
Its an apartment, asking for $279psf higher means you are probably taken for a ride unless it is $4000psf last done and you are paying $4279psf. And even then in this market you are still being taken for a ride.
 
However if you can live that up, go ahead.
 
Willing buyer willing seller as they say.
But i am sure the seller would be the one with a much much bigger smile.

http://www.straitstimes.com/archive/...orrow-20140510Lower prices at Panorama relaunch tomorrowAgents say prices could be 14% lower than at January's initial launchPublished on May 10, 2014 1:11 AMBy Melissa TanTHE Panorama condominium in Ang Mo Kio goes back on sale tomorrow at a discount, the latest in a recent string of relaunches.The new prices could be up to 14 per cent lower than at the initial launch in January, according to marketing agents.Consultants said more projects could be put back on the market at lower prices in the coming months as some developers may have to sell units to pay for the project's construction.Developers may also be encouraged to do so because recent condo repricings by their rivals have managed to move a decent number of units, they noted.At The Panorama's relaunch tomorrow, prices for a one-bedder could start at $565,000 in total, according to marketing agents.This is about 14 per cent below the lowest price paid for the smallest one-bedder in January - $658,670 for a 431 sq ft unit.A two-bedder could start at $820,000 and a three-bedder $1,175,000. New prices for larger units such as four- and five-bedders and penthouses were not advertised.The new prices work out to a range of $1,100 to $1,310 per sq ft (psf), lower than the previous average of $1,366 psf, according to caveats lodged with the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).The 99-year leasehold project has sold poorly, partly because home loan curbs set last year have made it tough for buyers to afford more expensive units.The developer, Wheelock Properties, moved 58 units in January at a median price of $1,343 per sq ft - just 8 per cent of the 698 units available. It had sold only 57 units in total by end-March, going by the latest available URA data, indicating that some units had been returned by their buyers.Wheelock said in its first-quarter results yesterday that it had sold 56 units at $1,365 psf. It did not specify the average price.The slow take-up had prompted Wheelock to write off $110 million for the project, which sent it into the red for the three months to Dec 31 last year.Wheelock had paid $550 million for the land in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 2, which works out to $790 psf per plot ratio (ppr) for the nearly 1.85ha site - far higher than the $560 and $650 psf ppr analysts had expected.Consultants yesterday said more condo relaunches could be on the horizon, with likely candidates being projects that have moved fewer than half their units."Developers generally need to get some cashflow so they don't have to dig into their own pockets to carry on the development," said CBRE research head Desmond Sim. But he noted that the threshold at which developers would need this extra cash depends on their profit margins from the project and the complexity of the construction.OrangeTee research head Christine Li said "very good results" from recent condo repricings may also entice other developers to relaunch their projects.The 75-unit freehold Hallmark Residences in Bukit Timah, for instance, managed to sell 26 units in February and a further 13 in March after its developer, MCL Land, cut prices.CapitaLand's 509-unit Sky Habitat project in Bishan sold 80 units the day it relaunched last month, at prices about 10 to 15 per cent lower than at its initial launch two years ago.Projects launched last year that have sold fewer than half of their units so far include Hillion Residences in Bukit Panjang, Kingsford's Hillview Peak in Bukit Batok, Vue 8 Residence in Pasir Ris and The Glades in Tanah Merah.melissat@sph.com.sg

Medical tourists flouting short-term rental rule
 

OVER the last few years, there have been reports of home owners purportedly leasing their properties to tourists, in violation of the six-month minimum subletting rule ("More renting out homes as 'hotels' "; April 29).
These incidents appear to be facilitated through portals such as Airbnb and Roomorama.
 
Increasingly, we are seeing a new breed of short-term tenants - medical tourists.
The Balestier area where I live is highly favoured by such tourists from the Middle East, presumably because of the medical hub in the Novena area and the proximity to various amenities and places of worship.
 
In my residential development, residents were alarmed to learn that more than 12 per cent of the units had been leased through a Singapore-incorporated company to Middle Eastern medical tourists, who typically arrive with large families and domestic helpers.
 
The Immigration & Checkpoints Authority's website states that visitors seeking medical treatment here may not extend their stay for more than 89 days from the date of entry into Singapore.
 
Consequently, medical tourists cannot possibly satisfy the six-month rental requirement.
Although residents in my estate value the diversity of our neighbourhood, we have little tolerance for illegal transient tenants who cause inconvenience and nuisance to us.
 
With the high concentration of patients from the Middle East, we are also concerned about the Middle East respiratory syndrome.
 
We have been reporting the cases to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) since January, and our managing agent has provided all available information to facilitate investigations. But to date, no enforcement action appears to have been taken.
 
The URA cited reasons such as the lack of direct evidence of infringement and impracticality of obtaining information from the landlords.
 
We are puzzled as the Planning Act empowers it to require information from any property owner, occupier or tenant.
 
We hope the URA will invoke its powers and apply greater urgency in its investigations and enforcement actions.
 
It did suggest that owners institute by-laws to deter short-term accommodation operators from using units within our development. In fact, a group of owners has submitted a detailed proposal to our council for the implementation of such by-laws and to improve security and screening.
Unfortunately, the council is controlled by the property developer, which also owns a majority of the strata units in the development and displays little interest in engaging residents on this issue.
 
I urge the authorities promoting Singapore as a medical tourism hub to work with the agencies responsible for building the infrastructure to support the growing number of medical tourists.
 
Beatrice Tang (Ms)

Well they ask for it.
Developments with large percentage of MM units face these issues.
So those owners who bought to stay will find it disturbing as tenants generally do not take care of the units as a real owner would. Moreover these are short term tenants.

Sentosa Cove villas relaunched at a discount
Developer Ximeng Land giving 5% discount for remaining 12 luxury villas on Pearl Island

Each villa on Pearl Island comprises two storeys in addition to a roof terrace and basement. Absolute prices vary from about $14.3 million to $25.5 million per villa. - PHOTOS: ARTHUR LEE

XIMENG Land, controlled by mainland China parties, is relaunching the balance 12 luxury villas on Pearl Island in Sentosa Cove at $2,185 psf on land area. The price is inclusive of a 5 per cent discount to the $2,300 psf list prices for the units. A year ago, the developer's asking price was $2,400 psf.
Absolute prices vary from about $14.3 million to $25.5 million per villa. Pearl Island is one of the five man-made islands in the upscale waterfront housing district.
"These are the last remaining brand-new luxury villas in the island developments in Cove, fully fitted and ready for occupation," said Steve Tay, associate director at Newsman Realty, which was last month appointed sole marketing agent for the villas.
Since 2010, Ximeng has sold seven of the project's 19 villas at prices ranging from $1,904 psf to $2,228 psf on land area. The buyers comprise Singaporeans, Indonesians and mainland Chinese. The seven units sold include two adjacent units bought by members of the Liu family that controls Ximeng Land. One was purchased for $17.1 million or $1,904 psf on land and the other, for $19.5 million or $1,906 psf. The highest absolute price achieved for the seven sold units was $27 million (translating to $2,162 psf), for a bungalow on 12,486 sq ft of land - the biggest of Pearl Island's 19 villas.
The project received Temporary Occupation Permit in the first half of 2012. The villas sit on plots ranging from 6,555 sq ft to 12,486 sq ft and with total floor areas (including roof terrace) of between 8,000 sq ft and 11,000 sq ft. Each villa comprises two storeys in addition to a roof terrace and basement. All four levels are accessible by a private home lift.
The bungalows have five to seven bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms.
The basement of each unit houses a lounge and wine cellar, and semi-open garden in addition to a concealed utility area, a maid's room and toilet. The top floor houses an entertainment room with powder room and a roof terrace. Each villa is built with wet and dry kitchens fitted with Miele refrigerators, wine chiller, ovens and cooker hoods/hobs. Big imported marble tiles cover the floors of the living, dining and bathrooms. Stairs also have marble slabs.
Each villa has its own private berth (imported from France) and swimming pool.
Ximeng Land is owned by the majority shareholders of Ximeng Asset Holdings Co, the parent company of Beijing Ximeng Real Estate Co, a developer of luxury building projects in Beijing, Yantai and Jinan, according to a December 2007 news release issued by Sentosa Cove Pte Ltd announcing the award of Pearl Island to Ximeng Land.
A company search of Singapore-incorporated Ximeng Land (S) Pte Ltd listed its shareholders as Liu Yangang, Liu Yanguo and Liu Yanqiang, all Chinese citizens based in Beijing.
Ximeng Land was awarded the 99-year leasehold site in late 2007 for $215.65 million, or $1,350 psf on its land area of 159,740 sq ft.
Mr Tay said that of the 12 units at Pearl island that have yet to be sold, four are under negotiation while one has been sold pending approval from the Land Dealings (Approval) Unit. He also revealed that talks are under way with a "very prominent" European family to buy up to five villas.
Sentosa Cove is the only place in Singapore where foreigners who are not Singapore permanent residents (PRs) may buy a landed home, though this is subject to LDAU's nod. A foreigner, whether a PR or not, is allowed to buy only one landed residential property on Sentosa Cove, which must be for owner occupation and cannot be rented out. The one landed property limit is on a per-family basis, including economically dependent children. Thus, if a non-Singaporean couple already owns a landed home in Sentosa Cove, their non-Singaporean children who are still studying and not economically independent would not qualify to buy another landed property in Sentosa Cove. The same treatment applies to grandchildren. However, grown-up children/grandchildren who are economically independent from their parents/grandparents may apply to buy their own landed home on Sentosa Cove.
The Sentosa Cove bungalow market is experiencing a dry patch. CBRE's analysis of URA Realis caveats data shows that there has been just one caveat lodged for a bungalow on Sentosa Cove so far this year. BT understands that the deal may not have gone through.
Last year, there were 18 bungalow transactions totalling $367 million. The average price works out to $20.16 million per transacted bungalow and $2,096 psf on land area. In 2012, 23 properties were transacted at a total of $461 million - with an average price of $20.5 million per transacted bungalow and $2,164 psf.
Samuel Eyo, director (prestige homes) at Savills (Singapore), said a major bug-bear among foreign buyers was the high transaction cost - 18 per cent in total buyer's stamp duties (the 3 per cent regular stamp duty plus 15 per cent additional buyer's stamp duty). "And if these investors have to exit within a year, they're staring at 16 per cent seller's stamp duty - regardless of whether they make a profit or loss. So total transaction taxes could be as high as 34 per cent. On a $20 million bungalow purchase on Cove, that would amount to $6.8 million!"
"Such UHNW investors will always compare Singapore against other markets," he added.
Highlighting that LDAU approval cannot be taken for granted - Mr Tay let on that earlier this year Ximeng Land had granted an option for a villa at Pearl Island but LDAU turned down the proposed non-PR foreign buyer's application.
The difficulty in finding genuine and motivated sellers has also caused a dearth of bungalow deals on Sentosa Cove lately. "Some owners are calling for high prices as they remain positive on the potential of Sentosa Cove. Don't forget: We are looking at a limited number of only about 300 bungalows in this luxury enclave, where PRs and foreigners can buy," said Mr Tay.
Despite the current dry spell in bungalow deals on Sentosa Cove, Mr Tay is confident of selling out all 12 remaining villas on Pearl Island by year-end, given the attractive discounts by the developer.

XIMENG Land, controlled by mainland China parties, is relaunching the balance 12 luxury villas on Pearl Island in Sentosa Cove at $2,185 psf on land area. The price is inclusive of a 5 per cent discount to the $2,300 psf list prices for the units. A year ago, the developer's asking price was $2,400 psf.
Absolute prices vary from about $14.3 million to $25.5 million per villa. Pearl Island is one of the five man-made islands in the upscale waterfront housing district.
"These are the last remaining brand-new luxury villas in the island developments in Cove, fully fitted and ready for occupation," said Steve Tay, associate director at Newsman Realty, which was last month appointed sole marketing agent for the villas.
Since 2010, Ximeng has sold seven of the project's 19 villas at prices ranging from $1,904 psf to $2,228 psf on land area. The buyers comprise Singaporeans, Indonesians and mainland Chinese. The seven units sold include two adjacent units bought by members of the Liu family that controls Ximeng Land. One was purchased for $17.1 million or $1,904 psf on land and the other, for $19.5 million or $1,906 psf. The highest absolute price achieved for the seven sold units was $27 million (translating to $2,162 psf), for a bungalow on 12,486 sq ft of land - the biggest of Pearl Island's 19 villas.
The project received Temporary Occupation Permit in the first half of 2012. The villas sit on plots ranging from 6,555 sq ft to 12,486 sq ft and with total floor areas (including roof terrace) of between 8,000 sq ft and 11,000 sq ft. Each villa comprises two storeys in addition to a roof terrace and basement. All four levels are accessible by a private home lift.
The bungalows have five to seven bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms.
The basement of each unit houses a lounge and wine cellar, and semi-open garden in addition to a concealed utility area, a maid's room and toilet. The top floor houses an entertainment room with powder room and a roof terrace. Each villa is built with wet and dry kitchens fitted with Miele refrigerators, wine chiller, ovens and cooker hoods/hobs. Big imported marble tiles cover the floors of the living, dining and bathrooms. Stairs also have marble slabs.
Each villa has its own private berth (imported from France) and swimming pool.
Ximeng Land is owned by the majority shareholders of Ximeng Asset Holdings Co, the parent company of Beijing Ximeng Real Estate Co, a developer of luxury building projects in Beijing, Yantai and Jinan, according to a December 2007 news release issued by Sentosa Cove Pte Ltd announcing the award of Pearl Island to Ximeng Land.
A company search of Singapore-incorporated Ximeng Land (S) Pte Ltd listed its shareholders as Liu Yangang, Liu Yanguo and Liu Yanqiang, all Chinese citizens based in Beijing.
Ximeng Land was awarded the 99-year leasehold site in late 2007 for $215.65 million, or $1,350 psf on its land area of 159,740 sq ft.
Mr Tay said that of the 12 units at Pearl island that have yet to be sold, four are under negotiation while one has been sold pending approval from the Land Dealings (Approval) Unit. He also revealed that talks are under way with a "very prominent" European family to buy up to five villas.
Sentosa Cove is the only place in Singapore where foreigners who are not Singapore permanent residents (PRs) may buy a landed home, though this is subject to LDAU's nod. A foreigner, whether a PR or not, is allowed to buy only one landed residential property on Sentosa Cove, which must be for owner occupation and cannot be rented out. The one landed property limit is on a per-family basis, including economically dependent children. Thus, if a non-Singaporean couple already owns a landed home in Sentosa Cove, their non-Singaporean children who are still studying and not economically independent would not qualify to buy another landed property in Sentosa Cove. The same treatment applies to grandchildren. However, grown-up children/grandchildren who are economically independent from their parents/grandparents may apply to buy their own landed home on Sentosa Cove.
The Sentosa Cove bungalow market is experiencing a dry patch. CBRE's analysis of URA Realis caveats data shows that there has been just one caveat lodged for a bungalow on Sentosa Cove so far this year. BT understands that the deal may not have gone through.
Last year, there were 18 bungalow transactions totalling $367 million. The average price works out to $20.16 million per transacted bungalow and $2,096 psf on land area. In 2012, 23 properties were transacted at a total of $461 million - with an average price of $20.5 million per transacted bungalow and $2,164 psf.
Samuel Eyo, director (prestige homes) at Savills (Singapore), said a major bug-bear among foreign buyers was the high transaction cost - 18 per cent in total buyer's stamp duties (the 3 per cent regular stamp duty plus 15 per cent additional buyer's stamp duty). "And if these investors have to exit within a year, they're staring at 16 per cent seller's stamp duty - regardless of whether they make a profit or loss. So total transaction taxes could be as high as 34 per cent. On a $20 million bungalow purchase on Cove, that would amount to $6.8 million!"
"Such UHNW investors will always compare Singapore against other markets," he added.
Highlighting that LDAU approval cannot be taken for granted - Mr Tay let on that earlier this year Ximeng Land had granted an option for a villa at Pearl Island but LDAU turned down the proposed non-PR foreign buyer's application.
The difficulty in finding genuine and motivated sellers has also caused a dearth of bungalow deals on Sentosa Cove lately. "Some owners are calling for high prices as they remain positive on the potential of Sentosa Cove. Don't forget: We are looking at a limited number of only about 300 bungalows in this luxury enclave, where PRs and foreigners can buy," said Mr Tay.
Despite the current dry spell in bungalow deals on Sentosa Cove, Mr Tay is confident of selling out all 12 remaining villas on Pearl Island by year-end, given the attractive discounts by the developer.

Well done! 19 villas, 7 sold, including 2 to own family.  
I expect prices to hit easily $1800psf for such developments before sales truly move.

Was offered D10 penthouse a month ago at $1560psf, then became $1500psf, then now $1460psf
 
Hhhhmmmm, was thinking, in an upswinging market, will prices constantly be reduced?
 
Or are we not on the uptrend anymore???
*horrors* 
*spine chilling music*
 
I think a realistic price now is $1350psf for that.
 
Porker will probably offer only $950psf

depends le .. how much terrace etc? if 10% of the property, then even 1400 still decent.
but if outdoor area is more like 15-20% or more, than the psf should be lower than your 1350 also

It really depends on how many years are left on the 999LH.
 
Most of the 999LH properties today have around 850 to 880 years left on the tenure. The remaining tenure for these is good enough for more than 10 generations. 
 
There are exceptions to this as I have come across properties with _only_ 600 plus years remaining. 
 
To get a better idea of how a decreasing balance lease affects the value of a leasehold property, you may wish to take a look at:
 
http://www.sla.gov.sg/doc/ser/DP%20policy%20wef%2018%20Jul%202007.pdf
 
Although the table shows a valuation based on comparison of 99LH balance lease as a percentage of FH, it should not be hard to extrapolate that to a 999LH property.
 
One interesting aspect to note is that the depreciation is not linear i.e. as the balance lease reduces to 0, the fall per year in remaining value with respect to FH increases.
 
Applying this model to a 999LH vs FH comparison, it would mean that the fall per year in remaining value in the first 100 to 200 years of a 999LH property would be very small.
 

what do you think of OCR 999LH at the price of 99LH $psf?
999LH is as good as FH .... ?

first they mark up 7% and then tell you they are giving you a discount. no free meal in SG when you look at the realty of the situation.
 
like i said previously, just give a cheque and see if they are hungry enough to accept your target offer. you think the number suits you, dont be afraid to write a cheque.

 Proportion of foreign buyers rises

The proportion of foreign buyers in the Singapore property market is on the rise following recent price falls, according to data published by CIMB in its Cost of Livingsurvey.
 
The report, published yesterday, said: “Foreigners view Singapore as a good city to own a piece of property, but cited high property prices as their key deterrent. In a separate survey of foreigners not based in Singapore, 35 percent of the surveyed population believe that the biggest draw for investing in a property in Singapore is its infrastructure and security, with Singapore being seen as a clean and efficient city. 
 
“However, when asked what the main deterrent to buying a property was, the majority (83 percent) cited high property prices and softer outlook. Obviously, our survey also has some shortcomings as Indonesian tycoons or Middle Eastern tycoons are unlikely to take part in our survey.”
 
It added that in reality, these views are also reflected in lower take-ups by both foreign and investment demand. 
 
“Foreign demand has fallen, now making up less than 10 percent of new sales compared to 15 percent two years ago. Investment demand has fallen as well, with upgraders making up more than 60 percent of new sales versus 50 percent two years ago.” 
 
Just like locals, CIMB believes the expectation of falling prices is the main deterrent to buying properties now. Singapore remains fundamentally a good city to own a property and demand should be supportive when property prices fall to a reasonable level. 
 
It said: “In our view, that reasonable level is a 10-15 percent decline in the next two years. With the recent fall in property prices, we have already started to see the proportion of foreign buyers creeping up.”

Firstly personally I do not think it is a good time to buy. Downside risks far outweigh upside potential.
 
However if you are really determined to buy another property at this time, I am quite sure (with some negotiations) the developer will give you the additional 7% discount even if you do not already have an existing property.
 
You have the advantage as the buyer at the present moment. For most developers today, they are quite happy to let go at price levels with reduced profit margins (not at a loss yet). 
 

thanks OmOm

Secondly, you make it sound as though foreigners are now rushing in to grab properties....

It may be good to highlight the following instead:
 
Foreign demand has fallen, now making up less than 10 percent of new sales compared to 15 percent two years ago. Investment demand has fallen as well, with upgraders making up more than 60 percent of new sales versus 50 percent two years ago.
 
Risks are high, upside potential low. It does not make sense for anyone to get their feet wet today. 
 
Caveat Emptor...
 
If the buyer has been educated of the risks and decides to go in in spite of being told of the dangers, it is a fair deal and the buyer deserves it when he suffers a loss on the purchase.
 
However, if the buyer is sold a property by anyone on the premise that prices will keep going up and he is not advised of / ignorant of the risks, I think it is not fair to the buyer.

In today's context, it is not so easy to hoodwink buyers. Everyone is screaming from forums to newspapers that price is falling. I don't think there is a large number of people who are not aware of the risks
 
In addition to the presence of CEA, which is ready to jail an agent who is misrepresenting

Price already dropped lah, when are you going to admit that?

ok... looks like i am mistaken. i'd always though that cluny and all other D9,10,11 have been dropping like a rock whereas suburban low class residential has been holding up
 
seems like it is the other way round ah?

 
No, everything is dropping, just not 20% like you mentioned...
Your straw man kinda weak...

yes, D9,10,11 prices are dropping ... Treasure @ Balmoral 48 units not even 1 unit sold
punggol, pasir ris, tampinese, sengkang, jurong are holding up because the price is mass market price ... $1100-$1200 ...
 
but for D9,10,11 to drop to $1350psf ... it's like Ferrari selling at bmw/merc/audi entry level price
if Treasure @ Balmoral drop to $1500psf ... i think sold out in 1 hour

You will be surprised at the number of people who have lemming-type tendencies where property investment is concerned. 
 
Misrepresentation is hard to prove, especially when it is not in writing. One man's word against another.
 

 
In today's context, it is not so easy to hoodwink buyers. Everyone is screaming from forums to newspapers that price is falling. I don't think there is a large number of people who are not aware of the risks
 
In addition to the presence of CEA, which is ready to jail an agent who is misrepresenting
 
sorry for sounding like an agent, or quoting research,
 
but someone gotta play the devil's advocate, otherwise this thread too one-sided and boring

Was offered D10 penthouse a month ago at $1560psf, then became $1500psf, then now $1460psf
 
Hhhhmmmm, was thinking, in an upswinging market, will prices constantly be reduced?
 
Or are we not on the uptrend anymore???
*horrors* 
*spine chilling music*
 
I think a realistic price now is $1350psf for that.
 
Porker will probably offer only $950psf

on a serious note, you are right. 
 
wise to give a big discount off the face value of what an agent say. Including what i post here

I have heard that many complaints to CEA are made by agents against agents

Sentosa Cove villas relaunced at 5% discount
 
Given the attractive discount, Tay is optimistic they will sell all the remaining 12 villas on Pearl Island by year end despite the current dry spell in bungalow deals on the upscale waterfront housing district.

You can always lowball them or the private sellers. A lowball offer involves a historical low price + squeeze factor. The squeeze factor depends on how desperate the seller is and how much a Bastid you are muayhahahaha

I think there are 2 kind of property developer.. One kind that's huge and big like CDL and Far East or have certain financial strength where they can start selling the units way way before even starting to build.. Another kind is the small small no history type, where they can only use start selling their unit when TOP.. Treasure@Balmoral Maybe one of these type?

Developers can sell before TOP if they have prior track record can they can do this by hiring Directors (Board) with track record. Once they have proven their track record, it is just a matter of applying a Sale License from Comptroller of Housing after obtaining Building Plan approval from URA.

Yup as much as they can hang up to sell, buyer can lowball to buy.

The cost has nothing to do with it. Maybe I'm old-fashioned but to me condo is something you find in quiet private residential neighbourhoods or around town. Not something crammed together next to government housing in hdb estates.

but to be fair to other residents, it is really annoying right if your neighbour unit turn into a hotel and have all kind of people come in and go, no? safety is another issue.
 
residential vs commercial ... it's a very clear line... isn't it
 
just like not anyone can turn their kitchen into a factory to make cake and pastry
but some already did selling cake and cookies online ... lol

but tenanted for a FT or family for 1-2 years and tenanted to strangers who can anyhoo book online for a couple of days and weeks still make a difference la
 
 i agree with your point ... commercial ... up front ... MM is already means commercial but that does not mean there is no individual who like to buy MM unit ... just like NY or Tokyo ... single or couple like to stay in MM or can only afford MM

Dispute leads police to suspected brothel in East Coast condo
A dispute between a woman and her customer led to the busting of a suspected online prostitution syndicate. -AsiaOne 
 
Thu, Oct 04, 2012
AsiaOne 
Four women believed to be prostitutes in an online prostitution ring were nabbed by the police in an East Coast condominium unit on Wednesday.
According to Shin Min Daily News, the police were alerted when a dispute broke out between one of the women and a customer at about 1.45pm.
A witness, Madam Liu, 57, told the Chinese daily that the man, who looked to be in his 40s, barged out of the woman's front door saying that he would file a report against her.
She said that she had heard the pair arguing and saw a porcelain cup being thrown out of the unit's window.
When she opened her door to see what was going on, she saw the man leaving in a hurry. She also saw a woman dressed in lingerie standing at the door.
She told the paper that there were five women believed to be Chinese nationals living in the unit. They all appeared to be in their 20s.
Shin Min reported that the man came to know the woman through an online forum. After obtaining her contact details, he came to the condominium unit to engage her in sexual services. She had asked for $128 as a fee for her services, the paper said.
It is unclear what started the argument.
Madam Liu said that the police arrived shortly after the man left and knocked on the woman's front door for about 20 minutes before she answered the door.
Four women in the apartment were arrested about three hours later, after admitting to prostituting themselves over the internet.
All four women are described to be slender and have coloured hair. Among them, three are in Singapore on special passes.
  Police arrest 4 women in suspected online prostitution ringClick on thumbnail to view (Photos: Shin Min)     
Lunch peak hour 
The neighbour who spoke to Shin Min also told the paper that five women had moved into the unit a month ago.
They were often seen bringing different men home, and had caused a great deal of discomfort among residents there.
After filing a complaint with the management, Madam Liu was told that the women would be asked to move out on October 6.
Madam Liu also added that the women often saw many customers between noon to 2pm and had good business during the lunch hour.
The women were often seen dressed in mini-skirts and would return to the apartment at around 5am everyday.
It was also not easy for others to peer into their apartment as the door was often closed. There was also a 2-metre sash in front of the door, obstructing the view of the unit from the outside.
The Chinese paper says the many residents of the condominium, which is guarded and has restricted access, have become infuriated by the presence of these women.

Lunch peak hour 
The neighbour who spoke to Shin Min also told the paper that five women had moved into the unit a month ago.
They were often seen bringing different men home, and had caused a great deal of discomfort among residents there.
After filing a complaint with the management, Madam Liu was told that the women would be asked to move out on October 6.
Madam Liu also added that the women often saw many customers between noon to 2pm and had good business during the lunch hour.
The women were often seen dressed in mini-skirts and would return to the apartment at around 5am everyday.
It was also not easy for others to peer into their apartment as the door was often closed. There was also a 2-metre sash in front of the door, obstructing the view of the unit from the outside.
The Chinese paper says the many residents of the condominium, which is guarded and has restricted access, have become infuriated by the presence of these women.

less competition for T2 to cherry pick D9,10,11 
 
target move to hougang, sengkang, seletar and yio chu kang. please don't come to west leave a tiny pigeon hole for me and my family.
 
SINGAPORE: Residential properties in prime Singapore districts have become less popular with Indonesians investors, who are now focusing on cheaper apartments in outlying areas, real estate consultancy DTZ said on Tuesday (May 27).DTZ said fewer than one in five of homes purchased by Indonesian investors during the fourth quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014 were in districts 9, 10 and 11.This is down from an average of 32 per cent between the first quarter of 2011 and third quarter 2013.Indonesian buyers have historically accounted for a large portion of foreign demand for homes in districts 9, 10 and 11, which cover the upmarket areas around Orchard Road, Tanglin, Bukit Timah and Holland Road.Data from the first quarter of this year, however, showed greater Indonesian interest in outlying areas such as District 19 (Hougang and Sengkang) and District 28 (Seletar and Yio Chu Kang), DTZ said in a report.DTZ said Singapore property remains an attractive option for Indonesian buyers, especially in light of the upcoming presidential elections in Indonesia in July.They have, however, become increasingly price sensitive."Indeed, the majority, or 35 per cent, of units bought by Indonesian buyers in the first quarter cost S$1 million or less," DTZ said.- CNA/kk

One of my rich indon clients has already given up on Singapore for the time being and sold most of his rental properties here, only keeping the "personal use" apartment at draycott. He's now looking at hong kong strangely enough, he buay song with all the additional taxes in Singapore.
 
On a more positive note, a close friend just signed papers on a resale penthouse unit in the balestier area for 270k below valuation. Seller is local but apparently needs to cash out urgently, making a loss on his 2 mill initial purchase price. Next week I meet my friend for dinner and get the juicy details.

Dispute leads police to suspected brothel in East Coast condo
A dispute between a woman and her customer led to the busting of a suspected online prostitution syndicate. -AsiaOne 
 
Thu, Oct 04, 2012
AsiaOne 
Four women believed to be prostitutes in an online prostitution ring were nabbed by the police in an East Coast condominium unit on Wednesday.
According to Shin Min Daily News, the police were alerted when a dispute broke out between one of the women and a customer at about 1.45pm.
A witness, Madam Liu, 57, told the Chinese daily that the man, who looked to be in his 40s, barged out of the woman's front door saying that he would file a report against her.
She said that she had heard the pair arguing and saw a porcelain cup being thrown out of the unit's window.
When she opened her door to see what was going on, she saw the man leaving in a hurry. She also saw a woman dressed in lingerie standing at the door.
She told the paper that there were five women believed to be Chinese nationals living in the unit. They all appeared to be in their 20s.
Shin Min reported that the man came to know the woman through an online forum. After obtaining her contact details, he came to the condominium unit to engage her in sexual services. She had asked for $128 as a fee for her services, the paper said.
It is unclear what started the argument.
Madam Liu said that the police arrived shortly after the man left and knocked on the woman's front door for about 20 minutes before she answered the door.
Four women in the apartment were arrested about three hours later, after admitting to prostituting themselves over the internet.
All four women are described to be slender and have coloured hair. Among them, three are in Singapore on special passes.

Yah should be around ah hood rd area, she's been renting a place there for a few years and previously mentioned she was looking at a few units in the vicinity with the intention of buying for own stay. Don't ask me why but she likes the area.
 
No details about the unit itself because we were msging, all I know is that it's got a 5m ceiling and the balcony "isn't too big or excessive, just nice".
 
When she gets keys and settles reno i'll go kaypoh kaypoh.

tsunami of vacant units and depress rental ... huat ah!!!
no 30% discount no talk ... 
 


FOR a health check of the private residential market, an investor needed only to check out the sales at an upmarket condo project in Ang Mo Kio when it was relaunched recently.
 
The developer attracted scores of buyers in a flat market - but only after slashing prices by 12 per cent.
 
The discounting lends credence to the forecasts made by some property analysts that private residential prices may fall by between 10 and 15 per cent over the next two years.
 
There are a range of issues feeding into this narrative, from both the supply and demand sides of the equation.
 
On the demand side, Nomura analyst Sai Min Chow recently noted home buyers' waning appetite for mass market condos.
 
She estimated that of the 12,200 unsold homes built on land sold by the Government since December 2011 - when the additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) was introduced to cool the buying fervour - 8,200 are in the suburban areas typically favoured by Housing Board (HDB) flat upgraders.
 
But even in a worst-case scenario where all this inventory is sold at a 30 per cent discount to current prices, she thinks property developers' share prices will not be that badly affected.
 
Some property shares would even be worth between 10 and 35 per cent more than their current levels, she calculated.
 
Ms Sai's analysis suggests that property developers may not lose much sleep even if they have to slash prices to move units.
 
But the same cannot be said of the legions of mum-and-dad investors who have sunk their life savings into a condo in the hope of achieving a higher return than the crumbs on offer at the banks.
 
Their consolation must lie in the fact that home prices are holding up so far. In the first quarter, private home values slipped by only 1.3 per cent from the previous quarter, after sliding 0.9 per cent in the preceding three months.
 
This seems to suggest a gradual correction is in the works rather than the more dramatic double- digit percentage drop analysts have been predicting.
 
Still, worse may be to come. The big question for many is how the market is going to cope with the deluge of completed units coming onstream between now and 2016. That may, in turn, depend on how HDB home owners who have bought private units - either to move into or to rent out for investment income - will fare.
 
This group of buyers has grown in importance over the years. In the fourth quarter of 2008, buyers with HDB addresses bought 255 new private homes. Two years later, in the fourth quarter of 2010, that number had jumped to 1,990.
 
It then more than doubled to 4,046 units in the second quarter of 2012, even though the Government had imposed the ABSD. This may have been partly due to developers softening the blow by giving cash rebates on stamp duties.
 
Then last year, property loan rules were tightened. A borrower's total monthly loan repayments now cannot exceed 60 per cent of his gross monthly income. But HDB owners took this in their stride as well, buying 1,200 new private homes in the first quarter of this year.
Let's consider the impact on the private rental market when these units bought by HDB owners are completed.
 
Based on estimates provided by developers to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), private housing completion may hit over 17,000 units this year - up from 13,150 completed last year and 10,329 in 2012. A further 48,000 units are scheduled to flood the market in the next two years.
 
This increase in supply may depress rental growth in the private housing market.
 
Rental statistics have not raised any alarm bells yet, with private residential rentals easing only 0.7 per cent quarter-on-quarter as at the end of March.
 
However, tucked into a recent Savills residential property report was an observation that in the first quarter, the vacancy rate for completed units in the eastern region had almost doubled, from 3.4 per cent to 6.1 per cent.
 
This, Savills, noted, was partly due to newly completed large projects such as Waterview on Tampines Avenue and The Shore Residences on Amber Road.
 
If the trend from the eastern region is a gauge, vacancy rates will shoot up as more units are completed. This may cause rental yields to come under pressure, especially in the suburban areas favoured by HDB owners and where most condo completions will be.
 
Private home owners renting out their suburban properties will also face competition from landlords renting out their HDB units.
 
What may aggravate the problem is that landlords can no longer claim vacancy refunds on property taxes. So rather than cope with the various expenses of leaving a unit vacant, they may lower their rental expectations instead.
 
A different problem may confront those wishing to sell their HDB flats and move into their new condos. In the past three years, the HDB has launched a massive 77,000 build-to-order flats (BTO) on the market to help to meet the demand for public housing.
 
At the same time, HDB has allowed singles to buy new two- room flats in non-mature estates, and given second-timers a higher chance to ballot for a BTO flat.
 
It has also introduced a three- year waiting period for new permanent residents before they can buy HDB resale flats.
 
These measures have dampened demand for HDB resale flats. Resale transactions fell to just 18,100 last year from 25,094 in 2012 - the fewest since 1997.
 
Mr Tan Tiong Cheng, chairman of property consultant Knight Frank, said the crunch may come when HDB owners get their keys to the large number of newly- built condos in locations such as Pasir Ris, Sengkang and Punggol. These areas are less likely to attract the expatriate tenants who offer better rental yields.
 
Caught between a sub-par rental market and a lacklustre HDB resale market, these property owners may have some tough decisions to make.

RM2m limit for Johor landed homes
 

The ruler of the Malaysian state of Johor has backed plans for a new RM2 million ceiling for foreign buyers of landed property in the state.The Sultan of Johor, Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar, said earlier this week that the current RM1 million limit is unsuitable for Johor. He also expressed his support for proposals to have what is described as an international housing zone to curb rising prices.Johor's Housing and Chairman of the Local Government Executive Committee, Datuk Abd Latif Bandi, added that the proposed new limit would allow the state government to control sales of landed properties to foreign buyers.He told reporters: "This, in turn, will protect the interests of local buyers as they will not have to compete with foreigners. I also agree that the ceiling price should be higher in Johor because of its proximity with Singapore."In Johor, we have to take into account that the price of land is higher and our proximity to Singapore means the demand for landed properties is also high. Local buyers also prefer to buy landed properties, so we must give priority to them."Sultan Ibrahim said Johor was different from other states because of its proximity to Singapore, which is a developed country.Sultan Ibrahim also said that it was vital for every property development to undergo an environmental impact assessment (EIA), but cautioned that such measures should not be used to halt projects unnecessarily.According to recent data from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Malaysia was the number one overseas buying destination for Singapore-based property investors during 2013 with just over 50 percent of all overseas transactions happening for Malaysian properties.

that BT article is interesting... the reason y many rich owners r keeping units empty is coz they dun wanna lodge the rental caveat or else itll show how much rents have dropped IMO, n therefore speed up their unit's price decline. Its either that or theyre holding on as long as possible hoping for a higher rent... Old units r under serious pressure as mentioned before but their owners r willing to rent real low coz they bought them long ago.

You really think the market players can be in such unison ?
If that is the case, we would be able to "rig" COE prices long ago.
And HDB prices too. And in fact prices wouldnt hv moved that much.
 
There are simply no tenants at the right price for the owners to accept the wear and tear to renting the house.  As long as they can afford it, they wont rush to rent but in time to come, you cannot sweep the dirt under the carpet .

Removal of Vacancy Claim with effect from 1 Jan 2014Vacancy refund claims are no longer available for properties with vacant periods starting from 1 Jan 2014. As property tax is a tax on wealth, it is levied on the ownership of properties, irrespective of whether the property is occupied or vacant. No further claims will be considered.

I that think article is pure bunk. It is simply a matter of price and demand. Owners have unrealistic expectations and the agents aren't helping much.

Price cuts at prime central private homes too

More discounts

 

Singapore
THE sale is on for private residential projects in the prime central region, following price cuts for city fringe and suburban projects which helped developers move more unsold units.
Palms @ Sixth Avenue, a strata landed semi-detached project, is offering to absorb the 7 per cent additional buyer's stamp duty which existing Singaporean home owners have to pay for a second residential property.
With this, prices will go from $5.3 million to $4.9 million for a 4,510-sq-ft unit, and from $7 million to $6.5 million for a 5,834-sq-ft one. The discounted prices translate to a per square foot range of $1,086 to $1,114.
The project will receive its temporary occupation permit (TOP) in the first quarter of 2015.
Meanwhile, Hallmark Residences along Ewe Boon Road in Bukit Timah is offering a discount of more than 10 per cent for several of its units.
A 969-sq-ft two-bedder, for instance, will cost $1.9 million, down from $2.1 million. Three-bedders will cost $2.8 million instead of $3.1 million, and four-bedders, $3.5 million instead of $4 million. An actual show unit will be open for a one-day-only viewing tomorrow, an agent told The Business Times.
R'ST Research director Ong Kah Seng said "it was only a matter of time" before core central region (CCR) projects started to cut prices. "They have been left substantially unsold for quite a long time, and generally buyers' interest for CCR projects has been very weak. Well-located projects like these have hefty price tags, and previously, there wasn't the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework limiting large loans. Some buyers like to overstretch their loan limits by buying costly homes with high leasing demand and hence, investment potential. But they can no longer do so after the TDSR." The TDSR, which requires financial institutions (FIs) to take into consideration borrowers' other debt obligations when granting property loans, is aimed at strengthening credit underwriting practices by FIs and encouraging financial prudence among borrowers.
Developers of CCR projects feel compelled to cut prices as the TOP dates of their developments loom closer, because empty units paint a discouraging picture of the projects and buyers may turn sceptical about their investment potential, Mr Ong said.
Two other condo projects in the city fringes are also re-launching units at lower prices.
8M Residences along Margate Road in the East Coast is offering an 8 per cent direct discount on its one to three-bedroom units.
For instance, an 893-sq-ft three-bedder will now cost $1.6 million, from $1.8 million. Per-square-foot prices range from $1,832 to $2,015, a breather from the median $2,100 psf at which its units transacted until April 2014. Buyers may opt to take a 10 per cent "rental guarantee" package by purchasing at the current price and getting a 5 per cent cash-back from the developer annually for two years - even while renting out the unit and receiving actual rental income.
One Eighties Residences is giving a 13 per cent discount on its two-bedroom units and penthouses, which will now start at $890,000 and at $1.4 million respectively.
Derrick Poh, marketing and communications manager at Santa United, the developer, told BT of the Joo Chiat development: "We've received enquiries, but those didn't turn into sales. Buyers are keeping a lookout and shopping around, expecting developers to reduce prices based on the current market outlook."
In any case, the lull in the June holiday period is driving developers and agents to take any measures they can to move sales, "probably now more so with World Cup fever distracting buyers away from home purchases", Mr Ong said.

Enye, not yet lah, as i said in mid 2013. its just the beginning.
 
Physical property market takes about 6mths to start reaction, if the situation is salvage within 6 mths there is hope.  But in this case i foresee at least a 3yr downward trend starting mid 2013 if nothing fundamental changes positively.
 
So not yet my friend, not yet.  Not for me.
 
Let those who need it buy it first.
I dont need another property at this point.

a. allow retired to rent out for passive income
b. allow buyer who bought from resale market (no subsidy) to rent out
c. disallow buyer who bought from hdb (with subsidy) to rent out
d. allow buyer to rent out after MOP - current rule
e. disallow PR to rent out - current rule
 
walao ... so many disparate views ... simi tai ji ... red eye green eye or purple eye
 
should people profit from hdb ... then EC leh?
a $800k touching $1M EC still need subsidy?

Jumbo mah..... limited edition. Think the owner is looking to see if can sell. He has not comit to anything yet. If someone take his flat, then he buy. He is just fishing in the market and hoping for the fish to bite on his asking price.
 
IMO, jumbo due to their limited supply can ask a bit more lah but not at such high COV. Not many transaction to take reference as well, esp in Yishun area (woodland different story).

yeah ... no fault to fish ... if got robert to chop ... why not 
 

Jumbo mah..... limited edition. Think the owner is looking to see if can sell. He has not comit to anything yet. If someone take his flat, then he buy. He is just fishing in the market and hoping for the fish to bite on his asking price.
 
IMO, jumbo due to their limited supply can ask a bit more lah but not at such high COV. Not many transaction to take reference as well, esp in Yishun area (woodland different story).

Looks pretty healthy to me. In a sustainable market, a typical project of 300 units takes around 12 to 18 months to be fully sold. That is approx 5% per month on a straight line basis.
 
In any case, as i have said, any significant drop in price will not be seen this year. We are already in June and looks like developers can tahan till next year

the 1st 50% may be easy to sell
the 2nd 30% will be tough to sell
the last 20% will be hard to sell
 
unless the project is very unique and have good selling points
once the buyer pool dried up ... only lelong can move sales

Very clear price drop reflected in a lower median across the board. (Not forgetting this are all the small pigeon holes units)  cannot mix that up with proper size units. 
(If you were to show this same table dtd a year ago, you will realise, oh i forgot you are agent, you wont realise anything except for the comms in your pocket )
 
Also the newer projects all have a lower median price compared to those launch ions ago.
Also percentage sold remains low
 
All depends on how intelligent the person is when reading the table to decipher the actual facts behind the situation.

Ok being a bit more serious now fellas
 
Think about the price of launches in the last two years. Lets say median price $1300psf.  This is inclusive of small units and larger units. 
 
In recent launches, the median may not be far off maybe $1200psf. But this as we all know is 90% small mickey units.
 
what does it mean?
Simply that people are not willing to bite big units at that price.
 
Even stupid agents will know that if a 500sf unit sells for $1200psf, a 1000sf unit in the same development will probably be only $900psf+ 
 
So Not Yet fellas!
Those who believe me kee chiu!

big units have not been selling well since probably 2010
 
the market is driven by speculators/ investors + fueled by ridiculous HDB capital appreciation due to shortsightedness under supply from govt + low interest rates
 
so many mm units being sold is just a reflection of the unsustainability of the market
 
however, developers will continue to play the game for as long as possible until the shiit hits the fan. Expect more mm units to be built, and at even smaller size to keep quantum "affordable"
 
meanwhile, investor demand is still super strong. the high number of supply is not enough to soak the even higher number of demand. This is evident from the ridiculous number of people buying properties in emerging markets. You know the market is in trouble when housewives and retirees are buying stocks, and in this case, "cheap" overseas condo at just $250K (with deferred payment scheme)

i suspect overseas demand is strong as a spillover from SG.
 
Many are buying overseas as it has no ABSD, no TDSR, some are under HDB MOP but wanna invest, most are simply being priced out by SG's pricing
 
Real low demand for Sg can be seen in 2009. Lakeside MRT condo launch at $700psf but cannot sell, big or small units the same. SHowflat is a ghost town
 
I don't think the demand is dead now. Govt knows this that is why CM will still be in place. Without CM, i am sure that people will still be snapping up small units and you might even see PSF prices creeping up for suburban.

If there are not so many launches happening and units for sale
If the foreign buyers are willing to pay the huge stamp duty
If borrowing was easy
If prices were not already so high
If rental returns can be a bit higher
If developers dont have to pay levies
If people are all huating
If there is no election ever
..............
 
Then prices may stop trending down...and investor demand may be less weak.
 
You know the market is in trouble when the buyers of these MM units are mostly HDB owners

property mouth piece is out to talk up the market again
now near new launches & no similar competing projects = good = why cut prices = bo logic leh?
http://www.todayonline.com/business/property/private-housing-market-unlikely-see-price-war-say-analysts?singlepage=true
 
have they forgotten with ABSD + TDSR + MSR ... the pople no longer can afford the prices?
 
Developers are not in a rush to lower prices as demand has yet to reach a standstill
 
“If we look at the few developers that are cutting prices, their projects tend to be a bit isolated. For example, there are no other new 99-year launches near The Panorama and there’s also no similar competing project around Sky Habitat … I don’t think we’ve reached a situation where there’s a price war,” said Mr Nicholas Mak, executive director of research and consultancy at SLP International.

Mortgagee sales touch quarterly high in Q2
Trend seen gaining momentum due to rising supply of homes, weaker rental market

Rising share of mortgagee sales


[sINGAPORE] The number of properties up for auction by mortgagees (or lenders) as well as their share of the number of properties going under the hammer has hit a quarterly high in Q2.
Auctioneers say this reflects the difficulty that financially stretched borrowers face in securing buyers for their properties since the implementation of the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework a year ago. Because of this, financial institutions have had to repossess more properties and put them up for auction.
The trend is expected to gain momentum as the rising supply of non-landed private homes will make it harder for mortgagors (or borrowers) to find buyers and thus dispose of their properties themselves - resulting in more properties ending up as mortgagee sales.
Furthermore, the reduced inflow of expats into Singapore is shrinking the pool of potential tenants, hitting rental incomes and hurting owners' ability to service their loans.
Figures from Colliers International show that this quarter, 42 mortgagee sale properties have been put up for auction - almost double the 22 in Q1 this year. In Q2 2013, the figure was just six properties.
The latest figure is the highest since Q3 2009, when 63 mortgagee sale properties landed on the auction block. The first-half tally of 64 was double the 32 for the whole of last year - and also a big jump from 24 in 2012 and 39 in 2011.
In H1 this year, the number of properties put up for auction by owners was 192, down from 226 in the same year-ago period.
As a result, while the owner sales' share of properties put up for auction has dropped from 93.4 per cent in full-year 2013 to 75 per cent in H1 2014, the mortgagee sales' share has risen from 6.6 per cent to 25 per cent. On a quarterly basis, the mortagee sale share has doubled from 16.7 per cent in Q1 this year to 33.9 per cent in Q2 - the highest level since the 35.5 per cent share in Q1 2008 during the global crisis.
Colliers' analysis took into account information as at June 19 from auction lists for the major houses for the month of June. While DTZ conducted its auction last Thursday, Colliers, Knight Frank and JLL will conduct theirs this week.
JLL's analysis shows that for January-May this year, 13 properties (both owner and mortgagee sales) were sold for a total of nearly $26.2 million at auction. Of this, the mortgagee sales accounted for nine properties which fetched $12.8 million.
For the whole of last year, 21 properties amounting to $99.6 million were sold at auction, of which 10 properties totalling $12.6 million involved mortgagee sales.
Typically, financial institutions provide some leeway to borrowers who are experiencing difficulty servicing their mortgages by giving them the first crack at finding a buyer as owner sales tend to fetch a higher price compared with a mortgagee sale which is often seen as distressed. However, the implementation of TDSR has made it difficult for potential buyers to obtain credit.
"More buyers have also chosen to stay on the sidelines with a view that prices will start to ease," noted JLL's head of auction and sales, Mok Sze Sze.
As a result, said Colliers' deputy managing director Grace Ng, banks have little choice but to respossess such properties - resulting in the increase in mortgagee sale properties surfacing at auctions.
She added that due to exuberance at private housing launches in the past few years, many buyers bought uncompleted properties "off plan" with the non-savvy ending up with units that have undesirable orientation or layout. Such owners now face difficulty finding buyers and tenants.
While the majority of mortgagee properties ending up on the auction block are residential, there are also signs of an increase in strata industrial units, notes Ms Mok.
Going by Colliers' analysis, nearly 63 per cent of the mortgagee sale properties that have been put up for auction in the first six months are residential properties, followed by a 17.2 per cent share each for industrial and retail properties.
Colliers' auction tomorrow will feature a mortgagee sale property at Turquoise condo in Sentosa Cove. The 2,777-sq-ft four-plus-one bedroom unit previously surfaced at an auction on April 30. It was withdrawn without bids at the opening price of $5 million.
Another mortgagee property to be featured at the same auction is a third-floor unit at the freehold Stevens Court. The 2,863-sq-ft unit has five bedrooms. JLL's auction on Thursday will feature mortgagee sale units at VisionCrest Residence, Residences@Killiney, The Floravale in Westwood Avenue and a shop unit at 116 Yio Chu Kang Road. At Knight Frank's auction today, a mortagee sale of a two-bedder at Dover Parkview is expected to go under the hammer.
Sharon Lee, head of auctions at the firm, advises those having problems servicing loans to be realistic. Given the buyer's market today, one has to be aware that potential buyers would be anticipating price corrections - instead of sticking to the last transacted price in the project some time ago, she said.

Little recourse for property agents
 
http://www.straitstimes.com/premium/forum-letters/story/little-recourse-property-agents-20140626
 
ehh ... i thought anyone walk in to showroom now is VVIP liao ... lol
who got moolah who is VVIP ... T2 would be VVVVVVVVVVVVVVIP


 

THE Council for Estate Agencies was set up to protect home buyers/owners and tenants from errant or unethical agents. This is in the interest of the general public.
 
But what about the well-being of agents?
 
As a property agent, I am left to fend for myself.
 
I had acted for a client in brokering the sale of a developer's unit, and had been solely responsible for introducing the sale and managing the entire transaction leading to the eventual sale.
 
At the eleventh hour, the developer conferred a so-called "VVIP status" upon the buyer, and declared that the commission normally payable had hence been reduced to a token service fee of $500.
 
I took my case to my management, which chose to look the other way. I then approached other agencies including the Manpower Ministry and Small Claims Tribunal, which advised me to seek legal action as they were not able to represent me.
 
I am disappointed that agents like me who have applied ourselves diligently have no suitable avenue to seek recourse except via costly legal action.
It will be daunting to wage a legal battle against an established property firm and developer.
 
Why are agents at the mercy of rules and regulations that seem one-sided?

This is no good, if the developer can get away paying off peanuts to the sales people.
 
This might spill over to other industries and companies could start coming out with ideas to short change sales people, even if you don't sell properties

Home prices to dip 10 to 20%: OCBC
 
first ... 5% top
second .... 10-15% top
now ... 20% top
 
waiting for T2 comment ....
 
https://sg.news.yahoo.com/home-prices-dip-10-20-ocbc-055711221--sector.html
 
OCBC sees residential prices will dip ten to 20 percent over 2014 to 2015.However, a price crash in excess of 20 percent is unlikely, even after accounting for the anticipated physical oversupply and interest rate uptrend ahead, according to a recent OCBC report.

don't bother with all these analyst reports. as good as not reading 
 
there is an urban myth amongst property agent that this old uncle in white singlet and shorts rode a bicycle to a showflat.
 
To avoid serving him and wasting a queue, the senior director pretended to go toilet and let the next agent (a newbie) in line to serve the old man.
 
turned out that the old man bought 2 penthouses for himself and his son.
 
moral of the story - those who dress down in showflat are usually the rich ones

Sentosa condos feel the blues

Losing their shine

 

Singapore
ABOUT two in five Sentosa condominium units have resold at a loss in the past year, symptomatic of the plight of luxury homes here, as financing restrictions put off buyers, industry watchers say.
Since May last year, 31 units have changed hands at six Sentosa projects: Marina Collection, Seascape, The Azure, The Berth, The Coast and The Oceanfront, according to data compiled by STProperty.sg from URA Realis.
The profitability findings is in line with data gathered by HSR Research which shows resale prices at the plush Sentosa district falling 25 per cent to about $1,800 psf in the first five months of this year, compared to around $2,400 psf over the Jan-May 2013 period.
That said, the price movements tend to be volatile, given the single-digit number of transactions each month. There were just five transactions altogether this year, and none in the months of February, March and May.
Of the 31 transactions in the past year, profitability analysis could not be done for seven because caveats, which include information on purchase prices, were not lodged for the units. Profitability is calculated by subtracting purchase prices from selling prices. Of the remaining 24 transactions, 10 resold at a loss.
Among the loss-making transactions, four were units at The Berth, the debut project at the Cove which was launched in 2004 and completed in 2006. Three units made losses at The Oceanfront, two at the Coast, and one at the Azure.
Two in particular made seven-digit losses. A 2,982 sq ft unit at The Oceanfront sold for $5.65 million ($1,895 psf) in November last year, after it was purchased in April 2008 for $7.2 million ($2,415 psf) - a $1.55 million loss.
Another 2,820 sq ft unit at The Coast sold for $4.8 million ($1,702 psf) in January this year, two years after it was purchased at $6 million ($2,128 psf). This was a $1.2 million loss.
SLP International executive director Nicholas Mak suggests that this could be due to owners struggling to find tenants for their units amid the weak leasing market. Some may also not be able to secure high enough rental rates to service their loans. (Most Sentosa homes are bought not for own occupation, but as investment.) "So they may find it a better option to just liquidate," he said, adding that the location is also not the most convenient for expats to commute to the mainland for work.
Another industry watcher added that buyers who bought units at $2,100 psf and above appear to have "overpaid". Those who profited from their resale deals mostly bought in at lower psf prices; a handful even got their units at $800, $900-plus psf back in 2006.
Meanwhile, several Sentosa Cove units are also up for sale at auction houses here. A 2,777-sq-ft unit at Turquoise condo, put up for sale by a lender at a Colliers' auction this week, yielded no bids, despite having reduced its opening price to $4 million from its previous $5 million.
Two Sentosa homes are up for auction by DTZ, both by lenders, one at Turquoise and another at Marina Collection. Another four are for sale by private treaty (akin to private negotiations) by JLL - two at Turquoise and two at Marina Collection.
Typically, banks repossess homes and put them up for auction as part of a repayment structure when delinquent mortgagors (borrowers) are unable to find buyers and dispose of their properties themselves.
JLL's head of auction and sales, Mok Sze Sze, said: "The owners of the two Turquoise units bought them at $7 million each, which is quite difficult to match in the current market.
"Auctioning is a good method to garner all interested parties in a room to competitively bid. Potentially, the owner can also expect to get the optimum price because it's a competitive method of sale."
Meanwhile, some Sentosa condos such as Cape Royale and The Residences at W have made strategic decisions to lease out their unlaunched units instead, given current soft condo prices on the Cove.
Roaring sales in the waterfront enclave back in 2006-2008 were hit by the financial crisis and had hardly recovered when the private housing market succumbed to successive rounds of cooling measures from 2009. The way Mr Mak sees it: "For property prices anywhere, what goes up will also come down."

Depends what is your 50% lah..
 
Jurong/Clementi pte to go back to 700psf.. is very possible. You can say that's 60% drop compared to Jgateway..
 
As spoken earlier.. i think that price will moderate to
700-800psf for OCR (LH), 800-900psf for FH/next to mrt
800-900psf RCR (LH), 1000-1200psf for FH/next to mrt
1000-1200psf CCR (LH), 1400-1500psf for FH/next to mrt
 
HDB will hover ard 300psf - 600psf
 
% drop .. depends what is the price you are comparing too.

 
Let see what i mentioned Sept 2013 will come true.. :P
T2's pic already pretty close to my estimate..
thing it's should bottom-out at the low end of my estimates.
 
 
 


 
Property market crashed already? This topic page 60 liao[/quote

then another day said ... price correction will impact mass market condo because of abundance of completed condo coming till 2016 and there is no critical selling point or uniqueness of mass market condo ... pricing is everything

who cares abt developers, the real fire sales are in resale mkt now. so many units for sale n negotiable some more 

 
there are some discounts but my friend who is looking says some of these are being transacted
seems like resale is picking up after some of the sellers lowering their asking prices.

But of course some will be transacted.
Buyers in the market for proper size units are mostly first timers and real demand.
Investment and speculative demand is super thin, the higher the price category.

Is Paying Just 5 Times Your Annual Income for a Property Realistic?
 
muahahaha ... it is precisely this kind of lame thinking that lead the developer to build smaller and expensive $1.2M to $1.5M
CAN afford? lol ... the CAN afford is die die must buy la ... 2.8% interest for 28 years ... what a joke ... lol
 
might as well say can take 50 years loan .... condo would be fking cheap then ...
 
JC must be a property agent ... lol
 

The five times of income to property price ratio is quite ridiculous. I feel that this ratio is only applicable during the “mata wear khaki shorts” days. How can one ever find such a low ratio of five times in today’s context? No way, even if the property market is to crash, or rather correct. Nevertheless, I would definitely wish such a ratio would still hold today, and I would bet all my money into property.  
Example: a couple earns $15,000 per month, which annually would be $180,000. At five times, they can only afford a property that is $900,000, which can only buy a 2-bedder condo at an RCR or OCR location in Singapore. If the couple has kids, then I think it’s pretty difficult to live in a smallish 2-bedder of approximately 75 to 85 square meters with a maid!
 
Rather, many couples CAN afford properties at $1.2 to $1.5 million and above when their income is approximately $10,000 per month, which is a 10x rather than 5x ratio. With savings of $400,000 to $500,000 (approximately 30% of $1.5mil), they can easily afford the mortgage at $3,000 per month (2% interest rate over 28 years). A savings of $400,000 is not difficult to achieve for a couple (both university grads) who have worked for 10 years possibly with a little help from their parents, say $50,000 to $80,000.
 
In a nutshell, the 3-3-5 rule is skewed towards an unrealistic scenario which is unlikely to happen in Singapore (for Rule #3). We need to be realistic about the current pricing, current market, and hopefully, capitalize or gain from it through long term investment or enjoyment of the property. If we stick to this rule, we will NEVER buy a property (condo, that is) in Singapore, unless we earn $25,000 per month income combined for a couple. (i.e. $12,500 each!)

About 30yrs ago, most normal working adults with an above average decent income could afford a landed hous as a couple.  I remember very clearly, my uncles and aunts who were normal teachers buying terrace houses for $350k in the mid80s.  My father simply preferred an upfront fully paid HDB although as a family we did encouraged him to do the same as his siblings who were even lower paid than him.
 
 
Today, we ask ourselves how many can buy a landed terrace house 1800sft without any help from parents?

foreigner buy now and sell to local at higher price ... when TDSR is lifted
 
nabei ... in any country property policy is to tax foreigner heavy but not local
in this case is terbalik ... walan eh ...
 
need to sponsor my cousin using australia passport to buy liao then transfer the unit to me after a few years as gift? 
 
Mr Kwek suggested in February that the Government consider lifting the hefty 15 per cent duty levied on foreigners buying homes after the property market and global economy showed signs of slowing. Prices have since fallen, confirming his concerns, he said yesterday.

More residents have trouble selling their flats
03/07/2014 on mypaper by SAMANTHA BOH
 
IS THERE an oversupply of flats? This was a question raised by Nee Soon GRC Member of Parliament Lee Bee Wah on Monday, after she noticed that many residents in her ward faced problems selling their homes.
 
In a Facebook post, Ms Lee said residents have approached her at Meet-the-People Sessions, saying that their Build-To-Order (BTO) flats are ready but they are unable to find buyers for their current flats.
 
"Is this (a) sign of oversupply of flats?" she asked.
 
The problem surfaced in the past month. At Ms Lee's Meet-the-People Session on Monday, four residents asked for more time to sell their flats, reported Chinese evening daily Lianhe Wanbao.
 
"They are mainly middle-aged and older, mostly looking to downsize their flat, but had been unable to sell their old flat to fund their new flat," Ms Lee was quoted as saying. "Without money, how can they get the keys to their new flats?"
 
She said there were residents who did not even have a single prospective buyer view their flat, adding that all she could do is to help them get an extension of time to sell their flat.
 
Gan Thiam Poh, MP for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, also encountered two to three such cases over the past year and, on most occasions, he had been able to get them a six-month extension, Wanbao reported.
 
SLP International research head Nicholas Mak did not think there is an oversupply yet, but noted that demand has definitely softened, with flat prices expected to fall further.
 
So, sellers have to price their flats ahead of the market, Mr Mak told My Paper.
 
"From the buyer's point of view, he would want to buy at next month's price because by the time he gets hold of the flat, its price would have fallen more," he said.
 
Lee Lay Keng, DTZ's regional head of research for South-east Asia, said restrictions placed on permanent residents and allowing singles to buy BTO flats also contributed to the drop in resale demand.
 
"Buyers will tend to take their time to shop around, so sellers have to be more flexible with their pricing," said Ms Lee.
 

 

 
price up many not happy, price down also no buyer?

Just dont mistake demand with means.
 
 
I demand a GCB but i dont hv the means to buy one.
The "demand" may be high but if it is fueled purely by loose credit which has been the case until TDSR came in, then its a bubble we are creating.  Just like what happened to car population when they allowed full financing zero down payment.  Every ah ter ah kow also demand. Muayhahaha.

First, the government has no business helping private real estate companies like Kwek Leng Beng’s to attract international business. Nor, as [straits Times’] Cheryl Ong put it in her opinion article in ST A20 yesterday, no obligation for the government to “give a lift” to the property market.” The real estate industry is an industry that basically thrives on monopolistic rents. It is not a productive industry, in a strict sense of the term. If Kwek Leng Beng finds it hard to make money, he only has himself to blame for not working harder. Meritocracy, right?  
Second, it is of no loss to Singapore if we miss out on Kwek Leng Beng’s so-called [foreign] “investments.” In fact, what we have observed is the extreme negative externalities wrought by the free flow of such “investments” (read: cash) due to excess liquidity which has its roots in the liberal cash-printing US, EU and Chinese central bank policies. The spike in commercial rental increases (again monopolistic rents) has caused consumer prices to increase, and the spike in home sale and rental prices in all sectors has caused plenty of problems for Singaporeans who wish to own a home. 
 
Third, by Cheryl Ong’s calculation, private home prices have spiked 60% since 2009. 
Assuming a generous sustainable rate of 6% compound increase for home prices since 2009, home prices should only have increased by 33.8%. 
We are about 25% over-valued. Quarterly decreases of 1.5% is nothing.
 
Forth and finally, the government’s role should be to develop a sustainable, moderate, gradual increase in home prices (just like overall inflation!) so that homes remain affordable for the masses in land-scarce Singapore – and not to indulge folks like Kwek Leng Beng who are too happy to make a quick buck from policy errors and mistakes.

TDSR is a good measure and should stay.
 
It's the additional stamp duty that is damping the demand from the high-end buyers ( ppl with the real $$ , not leaveage ones)  to come in, which he is talking abt. No wants to pays 15% more than others, even if pay in full cash.
 
At the same time, there is every reason for gov to attract high earning to buy and roots themselves in singapore. These are ppl that gov want to squeeze to pay taxes. Not the low-income singaporean.  And these ppl spending power will fuel other sectors in the sg.
 
So i dun agree that gov has not interest in helping to attract these buyer to come to sg.
 
Aniway, Kwek's opinion , although vested, is of good intention to sg. His business is not limited to sg unlike other "smaller developer". He owns the whole MCIL.. which makes him have a stake in almost all major cities. If SG is not attractive to him, he could divert his fund else where. He and old Lee goes a long way back. I feel that it's most of an honest opinion from a wise man. Of course, we may or may not agree with what he says, but his points is worth considering.
 
Definitely better, than the analyst that sways where the wind blows.

So 25% may be a big fall but not all that unrealistic actually....heeeeeeee

Yeah looking at SBF today it seems demand is still hot. There is still alot of demand from SBF to spillover into BTO. So my take is that HDB should not stop building and should have foresight to meet expectations from the govt's 6.9mil figure. Look long term or your legacy will be short term.

HDB, please do not be an idiot again and stop building flats for fear of oversupply. Please keep building at least 25K per year.
 
no such thing especially when you are aiming for 6.9
 
all supply will be absorbed at the end of the day

 
This is just an roundabout way saying that housing issues has been (over) addressed. Drop 25% in next 2yrs could be possible, but in view of the long term goal (6.9), will be lucky if it just shifts back up by 50%.

The problem is not only supply, it's the location.
 
When there is sever lack of supply, everywhere has a good demand.
 
When the supply is more balance,  then those worse off location will suffer lor. Simply because everyone dont like the location.  Seller want to move out , buyer don even want to look. Don think it's a issue with oversupply.. but rather poor location.
 
Was talking to  single friend who just bought last mth, she told me that the prices in her area is still going up..MP estate.

  still go up in some area?
 
so where is the market heading? up or down or sideways?
 
is there over supply or under supply?
 
is demand strong or weak?
 
seems like many people are confused, except for MCF where all of us are the real experts

amidst all the talk of price dropping, here is one researcher who thinks price may even inch up  
 
 
 
Savills Singapore research head Alan Cheong said that at this juncture, a critical factor for developers' success is "how good they are at reading buyers' wishes rather than their needs".
"For example, buyers may only want to invest in real estate rather than upgrade so to speak. If this is the case, it is pointless to build larger units so that a family can move in comfortably. Smaller units may be what they want, and with the TDSR and cooling measures still in place, that may be where the market is for the masses," he added.
By thus minting a substantial chunk of units in the affordable lump-sum price range for buyers, developers can maintain, if not inch up, psf prices.

from Savills?   Muayhahahahahahahahaha! 
Papaya seller say papaya sweet! Hohoho!
 
Moreover he is talking about the small niche market where idiot buyers get creamed.
He is also recommending that developers continue creaming that market segment becos that segment deserves to be creamed anyway.
However, even fools wake up soon enough.

Competition healthy, market weak thats all.
 
In any other industry, when two rivals team up, we know how bad the market is.
No difference in this industry or market , right?
 
Heeeeheeeheee....
 
However, it is in my opinion that the market IS healthy and doing the right thing.
It was too fat in recent years.  Need to trim down fast before it gets a heart attck or some chronic ailments.
 
 
 
Ps. More prop agents being dropped like flies in the months to come.......careful now

Singapore
DEPUTY Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam has raised the possibility of a further correction in property prices. He told a conference yesterday: "I think further correction would not be unexpected."
He told a conference that Singapore had responded early enough to raging property prices with a set of cooling measures, but added that a crash in the property market was unlikely.

2010-2014 ... property price had risen as high as 50% (ie: OCR $800psf to now $1200psf)
now all analysts/banks/developers/agents are looking at 20% drop which is not considered crash
and the 20% drop is on selected units and projects to clear stock ... not a typical 20% drop across the board
so what percentage drop would be considered a crash? down by 50%?

well said Dr V ...
TDSR should NEVER be removed even property price had corrected. TDSR framework is to ensure financial prudence and not targeted to curb property price. the reason property price skyrocketed and create bubble is precisely due to no financial prudence.
 
No need to ease property curbs
 

THERE has been an ongoing debate for some time over whether property cooling measures should be relaxed ("Too early to relax property cooling measures, says MND"; Tuesday).
 
Why is it necessary to ease them in the first place?
 
The measures - particularly the total debt servicing ratio framework and the additional buyer's stamp duty - have served us well by ensuring greater financial prudence among property buyers, and a stable and sustainable property market, besides keeping inflation in check.
 
While the measures have reduced the number of units sold, the main objective of reining in prices and speculative activities has been achieved. So why upset the apple cart? Do we want to go back to the days of runaway property prices and speculative trading?
 
The argument by developers that Singapore's reputation as a global city would be jeopardised is fallacious ("Right time to review cooling measures: Kwek Leng Beng"; Tuesday).
 
Foreigners wishing to invest in properties here would take advantage of lower property prices despite heavy stamp duties.
In fact, such investors would help boost our economy by snapping up properties at attractive prices. Conversely, expensive properties may deter foreign investment.
 
Competitive lower prices also enable Singaporeans to upgrade from their HDB flats to private homes, thereby contributing to wealth accretion and stemming the rate of price declines.
 
While property developers would like to see higher prices to boost their bottom lines, greater affordability of housing for Singaporeans should take precedence.

His comments are already very mild.
Simply becos he cannot be too one sided.
Must be politically correct so that buyers and sellers will feel comforted.
 
Wahaaha
 
As mentioned, the direction of prices is clearly down, its only the velocity of the fall.
 
If the TDSR stops one from buying it means one really cant afford it.
Well done SG Govt! Love the TDSR , they should tighten it to 50% . 60% still a bit fat...

Their profitability and efficiency are deteriorating. 
Singapore’s biggest banks are grappling with more problem loans and steadily higher interest rates, prompting Moody’s Investors Service to again issue a negative outlook on the country’s banking system.
 
Moody’s noted that the negative outlook will last for the next 12-18 months, as asset prices continue to fall and banks struggle with increasing credit costs.
 
According Eugene Tarzimanov, a Moody's Vice President and Senior Credit Officer, "Even a gradual increase in interest rates will put pressure on the banks' operating environment, because the rapid credit growth in recent years has led to a situation where many loans will not be fully seasonedwhen the repayment burden on more highly leveraged borrowers increases, as interest rates rise."

Singaporeans went on massive property buying spree abroad in 2013: MAS
 
According to the MAS, the value of overseas purchases made through real estate agents in Singapore has grown to S$2.0 billion in 2013 from S$1.4 billion in 2012.More Singaporeans are foraying into overseas property markets, but many of these buyers are unaware of the risks associated with their purchases. In a statement released yesterday, the Monetary Authority of Singapore issued warnings against overseas property purchases.

So this is good news for people who hv not bought at the toppish levels in the last one year.

Fewer BTO flats expected next year
 
Next year's Build-to-Order (BTO) supply is expected to be lower than this year's, said the Ministry of National Development (MND) in response to a query at yesterday's Parliament session.The government has launched 9,700 BTO flats this year, and another 12,700 flats will be launched in the next six months, adding up to 22,400 new BTO flats for 2014.HDB will also conduct a second Sale of Balance Flats Exercise later this year to augment the BTO supply."As for next year's building programme, we will monitor the BTO application rates closely and decide on the BTO supply in due course," National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan replied in a statement."As more resale flats were transacted at below valuation, we expect more buyers to return to the HDB resale market instead of relying on the BTO programme," he added.After three years of ramping up the BTO supply, the backlog of first-timer applicants has been cleared.
 
In response to another query, Mr Khaw revealed there are currently 10 families who have made three or more unsuccessful first-time applications for BTO flats in non-mature estate.

BTO supply should respond to demand and forward planning right ... why must look at resale price
at the end of the day ... price "matching" and "benchmarking" is here to stay ... officially or unofficially
 
if can sell higher and collect more money .... what's wrong?

They just changed the bloody valuation system into one where buyer/seller agree on the price of the flat before getting the valuation report, now so fast got kneejerk. If people agree on a price below valuation because they don't have the valuation reports anymore, it just means flats were overvalued lah knn bodoh siol.

Goddamn bloody idiots.
 
 
"ECs were introduced to help Singaporeans acquire condos at affordable prices" - means condos are not affordable.

 
How about making Mercedes Benzes and Beemers affordable?
While we're at that, why not make a GCB affordable?
Yippee

Yeah, so we realise.........
 
All this EC, BTO etc crap.
 
My humble take:-
 
Singaporeans should simply be allowed to buy a HDB to live in no matter how much income they make.
HDB must ensure that Singaporeans will always hv a home at an affordable price
HDB is not for profiteering or rental, any rental must be stringently applied.
Manage the pricing via differencesizes and locations and quality but do not set any income requirement.
Just all the TDSR etc is good enough.

They just changed the bloody valuation system into one where buyer/seller agree on the price of the flat before getting the valuation report, now so fast got kneejerk. If people agree on a price below valuation because they don't have the valuation reports anymore, it just means flats were overvalued lah knn bodoh siol.
 
you know i know who control the valuation value lar.. what market force is pure bs since the valuation is manipulated...

Hiap Hoe seeks sole buyer for Balmoral condo units
It has till Nov to sell them before it falls subject to big fees to extend sale period

Treasure on Balmoral: The Singapore-listed group wants to sell all 48 units in its District 10 project at a guided price of $1,850 per square foot or a total of $191.4 million. - ST FILE PHOTO

 

 


ANOTHER developer is putting up unsold condo units for bulk sale, apparently to avoid having to pay hefty fees to extend the sales period.
Singapore-listed Hiap Hoe Group wants to sell all 48 units in its District 10 project, Treasure on Balmoral, at a guided price of $1,850 per square foot (psf) or $191.4 million.
This follows attempts by other developers to offload their unsold units in bulk sales - as did Great Newton Properties for its Newton Imperial condominium project and Heeton for iLiv@Grange.
With buying interest still dampened by tough lending rules, property consultants believe more bulk sales at reduced prices are in the offing, especially for high-end projects.
"That's one way for developers to dispose of unsold units without incurring the QC fines," said OrangeTee head of research and consultancy Christine Li, in a reference to the government's Qualifying Certificate rules, under which developers have to pay extension charges to extend the sales period two years after the project's completion.
Hiap Hoe's project received its temporary occupation permit (TOP) in November 2012, meaning that the developer will have to pay extension fees for unsold units from this November.
To extend the sales period, developers have to pay 8 per cent of the land purchase price for the first year of extension, 16 per cent for the second, and 24 per cent for the third year onwards; the charges are pro-rated according to the proportion of unsold units in the project.
Hiap Hoe's subsidiary paid $138 million for the Balmoral site by way of a collective sale tender in 2007. The guided price of $1,850 psf for Treasure on Balmoral is lower than the median prices achieved for units at two other projects on Balmoral Road: Goodwood Grand ($2,360 psf) and One Balmoral ($2,451 psf), going by caveats lodged.
SLP International executive director Nicholas Mak said the bulk-sale attempt reflects the developer's softened view of the high-end segment.
"This segment may not be expected to recover in the short term if the government does not remove or reduce the existing cooling measures," he said.
If the potential bulk buyer is a property company or a property fund, the buyer has to pay an additional stamp duty of 15 per cent of the purchase price, plus the usual 3 per cent stamp duty, leaving the buyer with limited headroom for profit, Mr Mak said.
In January, Great Newton Properties tried in vain to offload unsold units in the 36-unit Newton Imperial to a single buyer, after selling only nine units.
Heeton was also said to be seeking $2,200-$2,300 psf for the 30-unit iLiv@Grange, which TOP-ed last October. Not a single sale has been lodged there so far.
Ms Li said projects have to be seen as "the right product with good layout" to attract bulk purchasers, who ultimately want to profit from selling the units to individual buyers.
Savills Singapore managing director Steven Ming said he expects a strong price recovery in the high-end property market - embattled for quite a few years - in the next property upswing.
Savills is the sole marketing agent for Treasure on Balmoral. The deadline for expressions of interest is Aug 21.
Based on the indicative pricing for Treasure on Balmoral, the rental yield is estimated to be in the region of 3 per cent, Mr Ming said.

	5 properties in 4 years = 100% profits
SAMANTHA BOH
 


SHE went for over 60 apartment viewings before deciding to buy her first property in 2002 - a one-room condominium unit in Mandarin Gardens. Even then, she was not satisfied.
"I made a mistake, I really think I should have seen at least 100," said former marketing professional Vina Ip.
The 41-year-old thinks she should have waited longer and checked with more sources, instead of solely tracking past transactions. Shortly after she had made her purchase, a similar unit with a better view, level and price came onto the market.
Still, she persisted. Over a span of 41/2 years, she added four more properties to her name.
All were funded by her own savings. She was saving 70 per cent of her salary during this period, and she could get generous bank loans in those days.
"Life became a catch-up game to save hard for my next purchase. Whenever my savings reached the $100,000 mark, I would add another property to my portfolio," she said.
From 2010 to 2011, she sold them all, except for her current residence in Verde Avenue. She managed to chalk up a net profit of between 80 and 120 per cent.
She admits that cooling measures such as the Total Debt Servicing Ratio framework make it harder for an investor to follow in her footsteps - especially if one is not cash-rich. But she believes the real challenge is to somehow acquire that first investment property and rent it out. Positive returns from this can have a rollover effect, she said.
That's how she funded her later property investments.
Next to that would be a good understanding of the market. To share her insights with budding investors - a move her friends labelled "crazy" - Ms Ip went on to start a blog, Property Soul, in 2011 and amassed a following of over 500.
Now, she has written a book, titled No B.S. Guide To Property Investment, and started a property club, with its first session taking place last weekend.
When making a property investment, she looks for a good location, a well-maintained project and a favourable tenant profile.
For an investor, a good location does not simply mean one close to an MRT station, school or shopping centre. "That is a good location in the eyes of a Singaporean, not an expatriate, whom we are targeting, she said.
"Also, birds of a feather flock together, so knowing who lives in the estate will help you predict how attractive the property will be to tenants."
It is also key to differentiate between a home and an investment. "Some think, 'I will just rent it out first and, then, if it becomes unprofitable, I will move in,' but it is never that straightforward," she said.
"It is about packing up and moving your entire family, and getting used to a whole new location."
Ms Ip noted that this is a mistake many first-time property investors make, along with buying on impulse at sales launches and trusting an incompetent agent.
One rule which she follows is to bid at a price at least 15 per cent lower than the last sales transaction for a similar unit, along with entering the market at its lowest point and escaping once she notices a surge in buyers.
People will say, "Wah, so daring," which will make you think twice, but you have to pluck up the courage to strike when the economy is in the doldrums, said Ms Ip.
So, is it a buyers' market now? Not quite yet, although it has indeed changed course, she said.
"When you call up an agent and he asks you for a time convenient for you, or if you go for flat viewings and notice that you are the only one, then it might be the time to strike," she said.

I think those guidelines are pretty sound for people who cannot afford to full cash, happy to say I managed to keep within those guidelines when I bought my first flat last year.
 
Maybe that's why I think she talk some sense, but I never go read her investing advice

Fed to end bond-buying programme in October
Move signals central bank's confidence the economy is gaining strength

 

PRINT |EMAIL THIS ARTICLE






Officials and academics disagree about how much, if at all, the purchases have reduced the cost of mortgages and other kinds of consumer and business loans - PHOTO: BLOOMBERG

 

 


[WASHINGTON] The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that it planned to stop adding to its bond holdings in October, in a sign of its confidence that the economy is gaining strength even as the central bank gradually withdraws its support.
The decision, described in an account of the Fed's most recent policy-making meeting in June, signals the end of one of the central bank's most aggressive efforts to stimulate the economy.
The Fed, which started reducing its monthly purchases in January, said it planned to add a final US$100 billion to its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities over the next four months, for a total of US$1.5 trillion.
But the account underscored that many Fed officials remained guarded in their optimism about the economy. It also suggested that they had not yet decided when to take an even more important step in their retreat: raising short-term interest rates for the first time since December 2008.
Investors generally expect the Fed to start raising interest rates next summer. The Fed said the decision to end bond purchases in October, rather than continuing purchases at a nominal level until the end of the year, should not be interpreted as evidence that rate increases were likely to begin sooner.
"Most participants viewed this as a technical issue with no substantive macroeconomic consequences and no consequences for the eventual decision about the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate," the minutes said, referring to the benchmark interest rate that the Fed uses to influence borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.
Fed officials disagree about the pace of retreat in large part because they disagree about how much more monetary policy can accomplish. Five years past the end of the Great Recession, the share of adults with jobs has barely recovered, inflation remains below the level the Fed regards as healthy, and economic output remains weak.
Officials are increasingly convinced that some of this damage is permanent - or at least, that it cannot be fixed by holding down borrowing costs - but they differ on the depth of the damage.
At the June meeting of Federal Open Market Committee, they debated why the housing market weakened over the last year, whether sidelined workers would return to the labour market in large numbers, and when inflation would start to rise.
Since last year, however, they have been in firm agreement that the time has come to stop buying bonds. The purchases are intended to reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, and to encourage risk-taking by investors. But the impact of the Fed's asset purchases, and similar efforts undertaken by central banks in Britain and Japan, remains highly contentious.
Officials and academics disagree about how much, if at all, the purchases have reduced the cost of mortgages and other kinds of consumer and business loans. They also disagree about the consequences. Warnings about inflation proved to be mistaken, but there is still concern the purchases have destabilised financial markets.
Officials in recent months have expressed particular concern that many investors have grown overly complacent about the Fed's plans, mistaking its predictions about the likely timing of its retreat for bankable certainties. While that sense of certainty is helping to hold down borrowing costs, officials are concerned that it will come at a price if those expectations are disappointed.
As investors have discounted the risk of losses, they have driven up asset prices in markets across the globe, raising concerns about potential bubbles.
"Low implied volatility in equity, currency and fixed-income markets, as well as signs of increased risk-taking, were viewed as an indication that market participants were not factoring in sufficient uncertainty about the path of the economy and monetary policy," the account said in describing the Fed's misgivings.
Such concern is a reason that Fed Chair Janet Yellen has sought to emphasise that the central bank's next steps depend on economic conditions.
Investors, so far, remain largely unshaken. "This concern about low volatility is somewhat ironic given that it's their policies which are responsible," said Luke Bartholomew, an investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management.
While the minutes did not clarify when the Fed plans to start raising interest rates, they did provide some new details about the mechanics.
Before the crisis, the Fed set policy by moving the federal funds rate, which is the rate banks pay to borrow money from each other to maintain required levels of reserves in their accounts at the central bank.
But the Fed, in buying bonds from banks as part of its recent stimulus efforts, has flooded those banks with excess reserves, all but eliminating demand for interbank loans.
Fed officials are generally inclined to preserve the rate because of its familiarity as a communications tool, a point reiterated by the minutes. But future policy would be set primarily by raising the rate the Fed pays banks on excess reserves, along with a second rate it would pay to investors for short-term loans. Those two rates would be set at a fixed interval bracketing the funds rate like crutches. - NYT
The Fed's decision should not be interpreted as evidence that rate increases are likely to begin soon, says the US central bank.

EC bad sales
As of end May 2014, 779 executive condominium (EC) units had been launched and remained unsold. 
The Ministry of National Development (MND) revealed this following a written query at yesterday’s parliament session.
 
In the next 18 months, about 6,800 EC units are expected to be launched.
 
The HDB website lists 18 EC projects available throughout the country currently, out of the total of 29 ECs listed.
 
In April, National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan said in a blog post more than 11,000 Singaporean families purchased ECs from Q4 2010 to the same period last year.
 
ECs were introduced to help Singaporeans acquire condos at very affordable prices

 

 
wah lau eh, 779 EC unsold, next 18 mths 6,800 ECs to be launched...
 
so many unsold inventory, i dunno why yesterday Frasers go and bid $320 psf for an ULU EC land in sembawang...
 
So much confidence by the developer to sell out 600+ units ah?

smaller floor area, using cheaper materials, contractors
 
the tricks are known to everyone. 
 
But seems like nobody is bothered by the tricks, still buying esp if the quantum is "affordable"

property cooling measures are implemented to cool the property market for soft landing not crash ... i was told
the most deadly CMs were introduced in late 2013 ... aka TDSR and MSR
assuming it takes 2 years to cool the market for soft landing
we should only see reasonable property price by late 2015 to early 2016? 
10 cooling measures from 2009 to 2013 ... really sibei cool liao

i agree with u, assuming everything remains hunky dory
 
however, nature of property market is prone to boom and busts given real estate's inherent characteristics
 
which is why i believe despite all the collective stratospheric IQ levels of the scholars, the CMs will not engineer a soft landing, and eventual crash will happen.
 
which begs the question why the hell they bother to waste time in the meeting rooms and writing approval papers to implement 10 CMs over so many years when they should just apply shock therapy before 2010 when it was obvious that asset appreciation is unstoppable with weak CMs.

Is the 3-3-5 rule unrealistic?
 
you buy a rolex not because you can afford a rolex with 50 months zero interest installment (ie: take 35 years loan to buy a $1.2M property)
you buy a rolex because you can afford more than a rolex (in full cash of course)
 

Why do the 99% always complain that they’ve no money or no money to invest? 
One of the habits that is common among all wealthy people is that they live below their means. This means that they buy a small car when then can afford a medium sized car, then buy a medium sized car when they can afford a big car, they buy a big car when they can afford a small helicopter and they buy the helicopter when they can afford the private jet. They’re not eager to own expensive toys to boast to the world that they’ve arrived.

look at the ad..
 
it says UP TO 36%
 
Prices FROM $1,300 psf
 
in all likelihood, the price is probably about the same as other neighbouring developments ($1,500 psf for typical units)

All these gifts are just sweeteners. Perhaps a few percent of the transacted value.
 
Maybe U are seeing big 6 figure rebates for super prime property, but i just dabble in average salary man market aka mass market and so far the usual incentives are like $40K ang pow or maybe lucky draw to win a car (without COE hor)
 
Or maybe it is because my colleagues are so good at selling that developer is very happy with our sale rate

i think nicholas mak or one of these experts said that developers would rather give 5% commission to agents than to give 5% discount on the price as the discount will not attract the buyer but to agents 5% is a lot of money and they will work a lot harder to bring buyers in! 
 
hope to huat more!

not really lah.
 
one agent was showing me a place to recommend to my boss. he was careless and left the paperwork on the table (in full view hor, i never open his file) and comm stated was 4% if he closes. 
 
needless to say, didnt bother to close the deal since the cost is simply being pushed to us.
 
i know agents got to make a living, but it cant all be at the expense of the investor as well ...
 
(been bitten once as an agent lied that he was getting 1%, but unfortunately for him, when the seller's lawyer was doing the paperwork, they had me prepare the cashier order for his comm as part of completion ... turns out it was 3%. not saying we didnt get a good deal, but after he lied to my boss's face, we stopped dealing with him)

i'm normally upfront to clients about my comm. Why not, since it is the developers who are paying, not the buyers.
 
As for working with brokers, my advice is always assume that they are pushing the deal which pays them more comm
 
so do your own homework and take their advice with a handful of salt

while driving listen to the radio the host ask the so called property analyst si mi tai ji for jun low sales.
as usual the analyst said due to jun holiday and world cup ... no one go showroom and developer also did not launch/release many units
then the host ask the analyst .... what is the upcoming direction for property
then the property analyst answer ... property buying sentiment especially for investment had dampen significantly including smaller unit aka shoebox
 
nabei .... 2-3 years ago ... property investment is the way to go
 
1. small quantum ... $650k-$700k a pop .... long term no sweat
2. low interest
3. singapore being land scarce ... property investment is sustainable
4. property investment is still considered as one of the safest investment compare to many other investment tools
 
now change tune like change underwear
 
1. interest is expected to rise ... this will be a challenge for investor to service their loan
2. investor especially local might overstretch themselves if they hold multiple properties
3. not easy to let out unit and some left their shoebox vacant and yet still need to finance the mortgage
4. facing rental pressure resulting lower rental than expected and need to top up cash every month to service loan
 
nabei ... same shit different smell 2-3 years ago and now
 
if 2-3 years ago ... advicing people to invest in property ... isn't now is a better time to invest since the price had soften 10-15%?
 
2 years ago ... sky high price ... good to invest
now ... price soften ... be cautious and don't jump in immediately
isn't invest now is better than the robert invested 2-3 years ago?

of course. i dont disagree. a lot work hard for their comm.
 
but when they blatantly tell u cannot push down the price cos their comm "is so low, less than 1% only" and then turn around and its far, far higher, it tells you a lot about integrity.
 
we got no issue paying higher comm either if its our deal. but the problem is the clear lying. builds mistrust at the offset.

I am very sad to say, I have never come across a good and reliable property agent. I am guessing that the good property agents cannot survive and have to move on to another type of job. The last agent I had high hopes for her because she always include a bible verse in her email. Turn out, no better than the others. I hope the authorities can improve the quality of the agents here. This goes for insurance agents too. Once you pay, you seldom see them anymore. I sincerely hope this is just my bad luck and others do not have not similar experience.

I am very sad to say, I have never come across a good and reliable property agent. I am guessing that the good property agents cannot survive and have to move on to another type of job. The last agent I had high hopes for her because she always include a bible verse in her email. Turn out, no better than the others. I hope the authorities can improve the quality of the agents here.

Insurance agent may be different though. I believe many of them get commission on monthly basis for the amount of long term insurance that they sold such as life insurance, so if the customers cancel them, they'll lose part of their monthly commission, and this commission will be ongoing if after they retire or quit their job, this is hearsay only, need some agent to clarify.

Nope.  Insurance agents only earn the first year or 2nd year of the commission from the life or investment policy and not much too.  For General insurance, yes they will earn every year you renew the policy but not much too, they averagly 10 to 15% depending on the type of policy. 
 
Last time insurance earn alot of money but now not easy liao since everywhere is flooded with agents and the commission getting lesser and lesser liao.  Imagine for life and investment, they only buy from you once and you earn only for the first year and you have to service them for life.
 
For general insurance renewal,  some customers so lazy to make payment themselves and they will call you to collect cash or cheque from them, every time you meet them you have to buy them lunch or dinner.

of course. i dont disagree. a lot work hard for their comm.
 
but when they blatantly tell u cannot push down the price cos their comm "is so low, less than 1% only" and then turn around and its far, far higher, it tells you a lot about integrity.
 
we got no issue paying higher comm either if its our deal. but the problem is the clear lying. builds mistrust at the offset.

 
what's low comm gotta do with pushing down price?
 
Did u ask him to give u further discount from his own pocket?

he ask to take pity on him lo. saying not earning $, and if below that offer price, supposedly the seller wont accept. he work very hard la, bla bla bla. (actually, my boss is the one who found the property details, we did our own checking and gave him the offer price. he didnt do jack shit, in fact, i probably did more work at the back end of things before calling him ..)
 
so my boss felt bad for him. (big mistake, i know ...)
 
this biz .. i've learnt one thing ... its hard to feel pity. whether agent, tenant or seller ... come across wayyyy too many cases of dishonesty or people trying to weasel their way out of things.

There really isnt a standard how much to nego.
As long as you have done your homework on the place, go ahead and make a firm bid for it.
Many selling agents jack up the price anyway.
Or perhaps i should say all, becos they know people will nego.
So most prices you see being advertised especially on certain websites are inflated.
 
I usually bring my checkbook along and make my bid with a piece of signed paper instead of my mouth. 
Likewise, when i sell, i ask for a signed check if the fella is serious.

while driving listen to the radio the host ask the so called property analyst si mi tai ji for jun low sales.
as usual the analyst said due to jun holiday and world cup ... no one go showroom and developer also did not launch/release many units
then the host ask the analyst .... what is the upcoming direction for property
then the property analyst answer ... property buying sentiment especially for investment had dampen significantly including smaller unit aka shoebox
 
nabei .... 2-3 years ago ... property investment is the way to go
 
1. small quantum ... $650k-$700k a pop .... long term no sweat
2. low interest
3. singapore being land scarce ... property investment is sustainable
4. property investment is still considered as one of the safest investment compare to many other investment tools
 
now change tune like change underwear
 
1. interest is expected to rise ... this will be a challenge for investor to service their loan
2. investor especially local might overstretch themselves if they hold multiple properties
3. not easy to let out unit and some left their shoebox vacant and yet still need to finance the mortgage
4. facing rental pressure resulting lower rental than expected and need to top up cash every month to service loan
 
nabei ... same shit different smell 2-3 years ago and now
 
if 2-3 years ago ... advicing people to invest in property ... isn't now is a better time to invest since the price had soften 10-15%?
 
2 years ago ... sky high price ... good to invest
now ... price soften ... be cautious and don't jump in immediately
isn't invest now is better than the robert invested 2-3 years ago?
 
wakao smlj advice

 
wat talking u sia?
 
of course advice 2-3 yrs ago is the not the same as today lah
 
real estate moves in cycle
 
2-3 yrs from now the advice will be different too, i can guarantee u that

thats the only way to do it lah  chop chop kari pok can close deal. 
 
thats how i bought my place ... wrote the price and on the back wrote down the deadline time  that way, if they fail to bank in after deadline, even they bank it in, it contravenes the deal

smaller floor area, using cheaper materials, contractors
 
the tricks are known to everyone. 
 
But seems like nobody is bothered by the tricks, still buying esp if the quantum is "affordable"
 
 
got such new ruling ah?
 
wow, govt still must come up with so many measures to slow down sales?
 
how come? I thought market is coming down?
 
or is the market only seemingly coming down due to all the cooling measures? once the invisible hand is lifted, all hell will break loose?  
not really on inferior material used.. it really boils down to each developer. I seen friends condo by Fraiser centrepoint, and another friend's EC also by Fraiser centrepoint.. both looks similar and material and workmanship quality same same.. difference is in pricing and location of the 2 project. 
I can't say the same for the China developer.. 
 
I personally wouldn't buy them scared by what I watched on those China tv channels about their quality so can't imagine putting hundreds of K of millions in a sour unit haha

I also believe it takes a certain type of person with specific personality to do well as a property agent. Just imagine if you have the luck to match a buyer and a seller, each and every time, on the first or second viewing. Collecting one percent commission from each million dollar deal. No wonder I noticed many property agents drive expensive cars.
 
We study so hard and nowadays got to work equally hard. We work like cows (gu) until end of the month to collect a pittance salary.
 
Look at these property agents show a few flats and walk abit already cry mother and cry father that very hard to earn the commission. Sometimes I want to tell them, look at the uncle and auntie cleaning plates for 8-12 hours a day and earn less than $1K each month.
 
Earning so much in such a short time, the very least these majority of property agents can do is do an honest day work. Is this asking too much?
 
This reminds me of 2nd hand car dealers. Another group of people I would never trust. I remember buying my car, they said no accident. A few months later under the hot sun, there was fading at the boot area. Brought it to AD, the took the carpet out from the boot and show me the repairs and welding made. I brought the car back to the 2nd hand car dealer, the dealer can never be contacted or found. The rest of the staff just act blur.

cannot say like that la ... no pain no gain (for worker) .... no risk no gain (for agent)
what if 6 months also cannot close 1 deal, how? eat bread and drink water
still need to wear suit and walk under the sun to bring potential buyer to view house
and in today context the competition is so stiff that even you work 8-12 hours per day also cannot close deal

that's why ... good year make a killing ... not so good year ... stay low and can also spend quality family time
ups and downs ma ... the only problem is those make money in good year and drink $600 ice cream soda ... lol
 
i personally know a case ... a car agent ... during good time when coe was low
sell conti car like sell cup cake ... i suspect he made $20k-$30k a month ... that 1-2 year made at least $500k liao

I offer $5,000. That's a low ball offer.
 
To answer your serious question: Do your homework. Have your own willing-to-buy price after your homework is done. Your valuation of the property will not be the same as others'. Work towards an acceptable price for both parties thereafter.

Its about 4% not 0.004%, if i buy 2-3 mio property 50k would mean nothing
 
Moreover what i offer is the valuation price which is 1.25m. I think thats reasonable even though house got reno but like many people said reno doesnt count into house price

Maybe I have little luck with property agents, but I haven't come across one that works for my interest.  Their interest always come before mine, I wonder if any property agent can truly fulfill their fiduciary duties.  Agent is a misnomer, they are all businessmen. 
 
A fiduciary duty is a legal or ethical relationship of confidence or trust between two or more parties. The two key fiduciary duties an agent owes to its principal are as follows:
 
a. it must not place itself in a position where its own interests conflict with those of the principal or whether there is a real possibility that will happen (the 'no conflict' rule);
b. it must not profit from its position at the expense of the principal (the 'no profit' rule).

Agent靠得住，母猪会爬树。
 
Maybe I have little luck with property agents, but I haven't come across one that works for my interest. Their interest always come before mine, I wonder if any property agent can truly fulfill their fiduciary duties. Agent is a misnomer, they are all businessmen.
 
A fiduciary duty is a legal or ethical relationship of confidence or trust between two or more parties. The two key fiduciary duties an agent owes to its principal are as follows:
 
a. it must not place itself in a position where its own interests conflict with those of the principal or whether there is a real possibility that will happen (the 'no conflict' rule);
b. it must not profit from its position at the expense of the principal (the 'no profit' rule).

 
i got a guy who puts the customer interest before himself 99% of the time. worked with him when i joined (he worked with my predecessor beforehand) and is probably one of the most reliable guys we know. even rental issues with any of his tenants he will settle properly.

You are lucky to meet one but then yours is probably a corporate account and is very long term in nature, he screws you once and he can say good bye to future businesses.  
 
For my own property matters, I only trust myself as the conflicts of interest is so outright most of the time, even signing exclusive would not align our interest.

i think people still have a lot of wrong expectations from agents.
 
Why would you even think that the agent will put your interest above himself? Would an employer really believe all his staff would put the company's interest above themselves?
 
take the agent's words with a pinch of salt, and if u suspect misrep or fraud, complain to CEA.

with 8% GDP growth, how to lose?  Growth to outweigh challenges in Asia-Pacific's emerging markets

 

Jul 18, 2014 - PropertyGuru.com.sg
 
 
 
Indonesia has been ranked as the most efficient and transparent emerging real estate market in the Asia-Pacific region, and the fifth most efficient and transparent emerging real estate market in the world.
Following Indonesia is Thailand which placed 11th overall and second in the region courtesy of impressive scoring within a number of operating conditions parameters.
The Philippines is third within Asia-Pacific and 14th overall, and scores well in a number of the property related parameters with bureaucracy levels making business relatively easy to undertake.
The findings come in Cushman & Wakefield’s second edition of its comprehensive white paper titled Emerging and Frontier Markets: Assessing Risk and Opportunitythat evaluates four key risks and ranks 42 countries using a weighted index to determine which markets provide the best opportunity for global expansion.
Bangkok’s office market remains landlord favourable with the highest rental rents centralised in the city, according to the report. Rental rates have continually increased due to strong demand and limited supply.
Thanks to the easy access and extension of the BTS and MRT lines-as most of Bangkok’s office buildings are connected to the stations-daily commute is not affected, hence occupancy rates and rental rates continue to increase. Moreover, with the ASEAN Economic Community coming into effect in 2015, developers have been refreshing their current and future projects to attract tenants.
“Emerging and frontier markets present some of the most significant opportunities for occupiers and investors,” said John Santora, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cushman & Wakefield Corporate Occupier & Investor Services.
”The coming months will bring challenges, but the growth opportunities in most markets should outweigh the risks.”
“Adequate security plans must address the physical asset, the employees, and the company’s information,” said Raymond W. Kelly, President of Cushman & Wakefield Risk Management Services.
“The right plan and protocols begin with pre-occupancy planning and address on-site and off-site security, business continuity, crisis management, and recovery assistance.”

If a longkang can be called waterfront, then the HDB flats at Clementi Avenue 5 also have waterfront view.
I am referring to the one near Provost and Pandan Valley.

I think slightly faster than a tennis ball, maybe a few times faster offhand (around few hundred m/s)? Most RPG flies or rather "sails" across the air.
 
Okay maybe it will give him a concussion but probably not take his head off.

The absd for singaporeans is only 7% extra. 
Removing it will obviously bring some buyers who cannot wait, into the market but it wont make any significant difference in the bigger scale of things.

I also believe it takes a certain type of person with specific personality to do well as a property agent. Just imagine if you have the luck to match a buyer and a seller, each and every time, on the first or second viewing. Collecting one percent commission from each million dollar deal. No wonder I noticed many property agents drive expensive cars.
 
We study so hard and nowadays got to work equally hard. We work like cows (gu) until end of the month to collect a pittance salary.
 
Look at these property agents show a few flats and walk abit already cry mother and cry father that very hard to earn the commission. Sometimes I want to tell them, look at the uncle and auntie cleaning plates for 8-12 hours a day and earn less than $1K each month.
 
Earning so much in such a short time, the very least these majority of property agents can do is do an honest day work. Is this asking too much?
 
This reminds me of 2nd hand car dealers. Another group of people I would never trust. I remember buying my car, they said no accident. A few months later under the hot sun, there was fading at the boot area. Brought it to AD, the took the carpet out from the boot and show me the repairs and welding made. I brought the car back to the 2nd hand car dealer, the dealer can never be contacted or found. The rest of the staff just act blur.
 
 
No disrespect sir... But I think you sound so sour towards property agents... U be one la since so simple n lucrative like what you say. Me no insurance, property agent btw.

MORE private home owners are not making their mortgage payments on time, figures from the Credit Bureau of Singapore show.The number of borrowers with delinquent mortgages - accounts that have not been paid for more than 30 days - hit 4,186 in May, up 20 per cent from the 3,340 a year earlier, the Credit Bureau told The Straits Times.Delinquent borrowers comprised 0.82 per cent of private home loans in May, up from 0.7 per cent in the same month last year.But there was a much smaller increase in the number of mortgage defaults. Banks wrote off six mortgages in the first five months of the year, a touch up from the five bad loans over the same period last year.The Credit Bureau does not decide on the status of a mortgage, it said, but banks typically consider accounts with payments that have been overdue for 90 days or more as a defaulted loan.However, industry players noted that the decision to repossess a property varies among banks.Although the percentage rise in the number of delinquent accounts was more than the increase in total private home loans, experts note that the figures are not yet alarming.Mr Alvin Liew, senior economist at United Overseas Bank, said: "It's good to pay attention to the numbers, but it's too early to conclude that this is the start of a major problem."Loan curbs, known as the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR), were introduced in June last year to stop home buyers from overstretching themselves.Mr Liew noted that as the figures are cumulative, there could be highly leveraged individuals who took out large loans before the TDSR was introduced.However, given the stricter loan curbs, the situation is expected to improve, said Mr Liew.Another possible reason behind the increase in overdue payments could be the slight rise in the overall jobless rate, which increased from 1.8 per cent in December last year to 2 per cent in March.Mr Song Seng Wun, regional economist at CIMB, pointed out that it could be a reflection of the correction in the property market.The number of private condominium homes completing this year is expected to hit 17,000, up from 13,150 last year.As tenants have more options amid a softening market, owners who bought units expecting to finance them with rental income could find themselves burdened instead, Mr Song said.Moreover, mortgages are almost fully drawn down upon the completion of a new property, bumping up the monthly payments, he noted.This underlines the increasing number of properties that were put up for auction by banks.Earlier reports showed that 42 mortgagee sale properties went to auction in the second quarter, the highest since the third quarter of 2009, when 63 homes were up for a fire sale.Repayment schemes can be worked out with the bank, said Mr Joseph Wong, head of consumer credit risk at OCBC Bank, but borrowers at risk should inform the bank as soon as possible as a sign of commitment to the loan."Some options could include lower repayments to meet a temporary change in their financial position," added Ms Lui Su Kian, managing director and head of deposits and secured lending at DBS Bank

 Release of 2nd Quarter 2014 real estate statisticsPublished Date: 25 Jul 2014 The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) released today the real estate statistics for 2nd Quarter 2014.1

Prices of private residential properties decreased by 1.0% in 2nd Quarter 2014, following the 1.3% decline in the previous quarter. This was the third straight quarter of price decline. 
 
Price decline was observed across all segments of the private residential property market. Prices of non-landed properties in the Core Central Region (CCR) declined by 1.5%, following the 1.1% decrease in the previous quarter. Prices in the Rest of Central Region (RCR) declined by 0.4%, after decreasing by 3.3% in the previous quarter. In Outside Central Region (OCR), prices declined by 0.9%, significantly more than the 0.1% decline in the previous quarter (see Annexes A-1, A-2 & A-62). Prices of landed properties declined by 1.7%, significantly more than the decrease of 0.7% in the previous quarter.

Developers launched 2,843 uncompleted private residential units (excluding Executive Condominiums, ECs) for sale in 2nd Quarter 2014, compared to 1,964 units in 1st Quarter 2014 (see Annex C-1). 
 
Developers sold 2,665 private residential units (excluding ECs) in 2nd Quarter 2014, compared to the 1,744 units sold in 1st Quarter 2014 (see Annex D).
 
No new EC units were launched for sale in 2nd Quarter 2014 (see Annex F). Developers sold 154 EC units in 2nd Quarter 2014, compared to the 149 units sold in 1st Quarter 2014.
 
Resales and Sub-sales
There were 1,314 resale transactions in 2nd Quarter 2014, compared to 941 transactions in 1st Quarter 2014. Resale transactions accounted for 31.9% of all sale transactions in 2nd Quarter 2014, compared to 33.5% in 1st Quarter 2014 (see Annex D).
 
There were 139 sub-sale transactions in 2nd Quarter 2014, compared to 128 transactions in 1st Quarter 2014. Sub-sales accounted for 3.4% of all sale transactions in 2nd Quarter 2014, lower than the 4.6% recorded in 1st Quarter 2014 (see Annex D).
 
Supply in the Pipeline
As at the end of 2nd Quarter 2014, there was a total supply of 76,0143 uncompleted private residential units (excluding ECs) in the pipeline, compared to 80,261 units in 1st Quarter 20144 (see Annexes E-1 & E-25). Of this number, 27,024 units remained unsold as at 2nd Quarter 2014 (see Annexes B-1 & B-2). After adding the supply of 12,812 EC units in the pipeline, there were 88,826 units in the pipeline.
 
In addition, another 13,592 units (including ECs) will soon be added to the pipeline supply. These units are from Government Land Sales (GLS) sites that have been awarded to developers, but for which planning approvals had not yet been obtained as at 2nd Quarter 2014; and Confirmed List sites from the 1H2014 and 2H2014 GLS Programmes that have not yet been awarded (see Annex E-3).
 
If these units are included, there would be about 102,400 private housing and EC units in the overall pipeline supply. 
 
Based on expected completion dates reported by developers, 9,242 units (including ECs) will be completed in the second half of 2014. Overall, 20,023 units will be completed in 2014. Another 24,893 units (including ECs) are expected to be completed in 2015. In comparison, about 14,400 units (including ECs) were completed in 2013.
 
Stock and Vacancy
The stock of completed private residential units (excluding ECs) increased by 4,715 units in 2nd Quarter 2014. The vacancy rate of completed private residential units (excluding ECs) increased from 6.6% at the end of 1st Quarter 2014 to 7.1% at the end of 2nd Quarter 2014 (see Annex E-1).
  OFFICE SPACEPrices and Rentals
Prices of office space remained unchanged in 2nd Quarter 2014, following the increase of 0.5% in the previous quarter (see Annex A-1). Rentals of office space rose 2.8% in 2nd Quarter 2014,  following the 2.4% increase in 1st Quarter 2014 (see Annexes A-3 & A-5).
 
Supply in the Pipeline
At the end of 2nd Quarter 2014, there was a total supply of about 1.055 million sq m GFA of office space in the pipeline (see Annexes E-1 & E-2). 
 
Stock and Vacancy
The amount of occupied office space increased by 22,000 sq m (nett) in 2nd Quarter 2014, compared to the 6,000 sq m (nett) increase in the previous quarter. The stock of office space decreased by 1,000 sq m (nett) in 2nd Quarter 2014, compared to the increase of 15,000 sq m (nett) in the previous quarter. As a result, the island-wide vacancy rate of office space at the end of 2nd Quarter 2014 fell to 9.6%, from 10.0% at the end of 1st Quarter 2014 (see Annexes A-5 & E-1).

i think people still have a lot of wrong expectations from agents.
 
Why would you even think that the agent will put your interest above himself? Would an employer really believe all his staff would put the company's interest above themselves?
 
 

Ok, at least you are honest and admitted to it.  You rather sell a property low than share the sales commission with another agent with a better offer (ie taking the money and screwing your customer at the same time). Most people are aware there is no principal/agent relationship and they are just dealing with property salespeople.
 
Most employees' interest are aligned to those of their employers' with the setting of the correct KPIs. There is also no major conflict of interest most of the time, otherwise corporate won't survive.

Let us call longkang, a longkang
If a longkang can be called waterfront, then the HDB flats at Clementi Avenue 5 also have waterfront view.
I am referring to the one near Provost and Pandan Valley.
I believe the proper term is called canal. My friend lives at waterbank. My parents stay beside clementi canal. I think these are Ok. They are actually natural rivers mostly that were changed to canals to prevent flooding. 
Yes the pandan Valley side is like a longkang. 
Anyway benefits are bit cooler in daytime but really a lot of oxidation or rust on your electronic stuff like metal panels and connectors
 
Btw h20 residences is beside a real river . it's not a pseudo river. My mother knows of it since her childhood. 
Of course it's not true waterfront living but don't Diss it just cos it's near a body of water that's not a sea.

My personal opinion is the market is owning a correction long overdue, to me I don't see why anyone other than Singaporeans should benefit from a property increase expecially in public housing.
 
I have warned many times in the past 2 years with regards to a bubble burst and will continue to do so. I do not think singapore will recover from this drop personally.
 
Reasons being 
 
1. Restricted inflow of investments to create jobs for the middle class
 
2. Too many SME are being priced out of via unrealistic rental from the shop spaces be it in shopping centres or even shophouses. Even the hawker centres nowadays charge a ridiculous amount to the hawkers.
 
3. Our garmen is too myopic in their policies,  first they are not willing to offend foreigners in certain areas and turn a blind eye to abuses to the systems. ie the pr system,  too much has being given.
 
4. Lack of technology advancement and a global company to bring us to the world,  since 90+% of Singaporean in SG owned a phone why are our telco one of the worse?  Be it in software or hardware development. The last global I heard is creative which is a passe.
 
5.lack of vision from future leaders,  or lack of future leaders at all.

Now before any over zealous protector of PR come in I will explain to you why I think I deserve it.
 
1. Let's say my taxable income is roughly 400-500k p.a 
 
2. I have serve Ns using the peak of my youth 2 and half years and 8 years of reservist which is roughly 3month plus the countless days of recall manning and I ppt. Let's round it of to 3 years for easy computation.
 
3. In compensation I am being paid roughly 10k per year and 30k in 3.
 
Which means i lose 3*400k of income in return for 30k 
 
Price in every shit,  I still lose 1mil for those effort to keep my country safe as compared to some leeches in the PR.  So why should I not say that PRs are given too much?

Opportunity cost dude , 3 more years of youth or working life , personally i think bao jiak in my industry. As long as that bugger not stupid. I didn't include non taxable capital gains. I think i can make this 400k for another 3 more years , why not?
 
That said i didn't think i wasted my time in NS , it is just only the opportunity cost to prove just in case PRs wanna think otherwise.

the opportunity cost for 18-20 years old is low ... everyday facebook, play game and "chase girl" unless he is mark zukerberg
the opportunity cost for a 30-35 might be high especially in climbing corporate ladder
the opporunity cost for a CEO is in millions and hundreds millions liao
 
the opportunity cost for a cleaner not to work 1 day is $1000/30 days = $33/- 
 
400k for another 3 more years and 400k pa is very different leh, aka 1.2mil over 3 yrs from 18-20yo?

400k p/a or not depends on the person. @CH_co is currently making that so what's the problem? The opportunity cost for him is indeed 400k per year.

yeah ... if a junior minister without portfolio can make $1M a year, a perm sec can make $600k a year (at least?)
CH_CO highly likely to make $400k a year or a lot more
else those $5M-$10M property who buy?
just check propertyguru $5M to $10M property at least 600 fking pages ... even after de-dupe also at least 50-100 pages
i strongly believe many out there make > $400k a year

i agree with what you said about opportunity cost of 2-3yrs spend in NS instead of out already in the workforce.
but what i dont agree is defining the opportunity cost as 400k pa, maybe i small fry but IF someone can achieved 400k pa anyway, he/she probably wont bother about that 2-3yrs opportunity cost.

Dude you fail to understand what i am trying to put across is the earlier i come out of the work force , the longer i have to make another 400k p.a in my work years.
 
If i took 10 years to reach where i am and started working at 25 , plus part time and stuff
 
For e.g , i start studying at 18 for uni , i will be out by 22 at most given 10 years to reach where i am , by 35 i would have made more now as compared than if i served.
 
Of course , you can always choose to contest your choice but i am stating a fact i would probably earn the same if not more in the upcoming 3 years.

bro, i understand your point well.
my points are,
 
1) I do not agree that the 2-3 yrs in NS which u deem as opportunist cost will prevent you from making 400k pa later on some point in life
2) for someone who has no calibre to make 400k pa, give him extra 10yrs also no use, not to mention 2-3yrs of NS
3) for someone who has the calibre to make 400k or more pa, even start working from 40yo also can achieve

Dude , that is a self limiting belief , if one already hard cast himself to how much he can earn then he will always be where he is. You are trying to say everyone here is stupid so cannot make 400k. I always give everyone the benefit of doubt til proven otherwise. Sky is always the limit.
 
I am trying to tell you , even whether one has calibre or not , it doesn't show in their resume neither when they report for NS . I am also saying , for those time i served , it deters many which can probably do more in their lifetime as compared to leeches which doesn't need to serve and still make use of our system for their advantage. I am not alone. I have friends which served and continue to make more than whatever i am making all had the same question , what if , i didn't serve? Could i have made even more? Thus the fact that many chose to run from Singapore avoiding NS while many which doesn't need to serve(i.e PRs or foreigners) flock here and make use of the others which chose to serve to protect them.
 
As for your 3 probability , it is a maybe. For my case , i am stating a real life example. Ask yourself , how do you make 400k or more when you start work at 40 , how long do you need? I am not saying you can't but How long more do u have left to enjoy it? Stupid question stupid answer right? By the way ,i am probably trying to give the benefit of doubt the on average we all have a chance to make this amounts.
 
As you mentioned , no calibre give 10 years also like this , so how are you going to define calibre? 一只竹竿打反一艘船？ Now the possiblity of what ifs is the opportunity cost which i have being saying for so long. Dude if you cannot comprehend what i am trying to say i cannot help you.

i am small fry as compare to the ferraris and porsches of trottle , soya , porker and gang. Mine is achievable with luck.
 
Buy a few property during a crash with everything you got and leverage to the hilt , if u fail you bankrupt. Just sit on it and continue to add more. Rental incomes will be suffice to make these money if you have enough.
 
Coming from where i am from , it is not difficult to know when the market is bad and when is it good. I have already given a heads up many times throughout the past 1 to 2 years on the potential effect , just scroll back on my posts.
 

Job hazard , haha see too many sale personals to the point of disgust back in my dept.
 
 
 
By the way, never ask a "banker" whether their product is the best, instead look up the other banks to compare what they offer , due diligence is important , falling for one's showmanship would only result in investments which are likely to fail.
 
Anyway back to property . Looking forward , though property prices are unlikely to drop sharply but it is likely that there won't be much liquidity in the secondary markets as the ones holding on to their properties are unlikely to sell them. Unless one or two of the things below happen
 
1. Sharp hikes in interest (sibor rates)
2. Economic downturn resulting to mass corrections in multi asset classes
3. Sudden withdrawals of foreign investments from Singapore
4. War
5. Over supply of properties due to various reasons ( bankrupted developers/investors etc )

Ok, at least you are honest and admitted to it. You rather sell a property low than share the sales commission with another agent with a better offer (ie taking the money and screwing your customer at the same time). Most people are aware there is no principal/agent relationship and they are just dealing with property salespeople.
 
Most employees' interest are aligned to those of their employers' with the setting of the correct KPIs. There is also no major conflict of interest most of the time, otherwise corporate won't survive.

 
nope, i rather sell new projects. First, there is no need for me to try to negotiate price, it is take it or leave it and i am happy to work with multiple agents if it means selling more units.
 
second, in today's market it is so much easier to move new projects than resale. An average agent who does resale can probably close a deal or two each month. An average agent who does new projects can easily do twice that number. 
 
based on my little bit of corporate experience, i recalled my ex bosses would set very easy KPIs for us as it would also translate very easy KPIs for themselves. So end up everyone sure get maximum bonus each year with ease. No conflict of interest between employees for sure, but i can't say for the shareholders. Mind you, it was a major financial institution, and is still around today after the financial crisis.

That is because no bank in history is foolish enough to pay the credit department/ approving officers based on percentage of all loans approved.  Loans are still the largest business segment of most commercial banks.

Let us call longkang, a longkang

If a longkang can be called waterfront, then the HDB flats at Clementi Avenue 5 also have waterfront view.

I am referring to the one near Provost and Pandan Valley.

Flat glut: Developers grapple with unsold flats as supply goes through the roof
 
assuming 30% unsold. there is 50,000+ units waiting to be lowball? 
opps ... hdb cannot lowball leh ... fixed price by ah gong ... hehe
hdb developer no worry right ... ah gong will settle the payment for unsold flats
 
Almost 175,000 units are expected in the next 3 years. 
Both private condos and HDB flats are increasing at a staggering rate, with almost 175,000 new units expected to crowd the property market within the next 3 years. This in turn will only drag prices further.
 
According to PropertyGuru’s Outlook Report for H2 2014, a further 65,128 private condos are expected to be completed between this quarter and end 2016, while 108,000 HDB flats will come onstream from 2014 till 2017.
 
For private developers, the amount of vacant units up for sale is expected to be much larger than this as a result of spillovers from the year before.
 
“This cycle of remnant units will continue to have a domino effect on prices year- on-yearin the long run, adding further pressure on developers to offer discounts and incentives to purchase their projects,” noted the report.
 
Meanwhile, the large supply of HDB flats market will influence the amount of resale flats in the market in the next 3-5 years.
 
“Current flat owners are more likely to set their sights on the resale HDB market rather than purchase another BTO. This is because second-time applicants must have a monthly household income of less than $12,000 to qualify for a BTO as well as the fact that they are not as favoured as compared to first-timers with families (70 to 95 percent of BTO flats are set aside for the latter). As such, the effect of higher
 
BTO supply on resale demand is low – at least for the short term,” stated the report.

These CMs are all CMI. They had no effect whatsoever, some even helped property chiong, LOL! If you remember, that's how MBT became "popular". So removing CMs does the opposite, to cool down property instead of helping. Of course, we know the only effective CM was the last one: TDSR. But we also got QE taperring and iminent interest rate increase, so do your own calculations. It's safe to say that the mid-term outlook for SG property isn't good.

Plse read my post carefully.  I didnt say 10% vouchers.
 
Absorb stamp duty is already 10% for some.
Other furnishing vouchers probably 3-5%
Some give other shopping vouchers .
 
My message is clear.
Dont be fooled by developers psf prices. 
The actual psf is much lower. 
All this is done to prop up the ailing market.
Otherwise, you will se psf price tumble like crazy and the selldown will happen.
 
Well, it is happening only a bit later and more gradual.
 
Congrats on your tremendous sales, by the way.
You are probably one of the top agents in town.
Wonderful.

i think u're mistaken again, i only make average sales. Enough to survive in the industry.
 
I do hope to become one of the top agents in town, then can also buy mutiple properties like most of the buyers i meet everyday!

No problem. In few years we will know who are those sour grapes and who are those who will cry father cry mother blaming govt this and that.

 
QE and int rates are direct factors. TDSR is also quite an impt factor. Supply and vacancy are just the results of these factors.

 
Seriously , easy money is never a good way to grow business , everyone knows that. Why would i be crying mother and father when i already expected it to happen?
 
The ones which are crying are the ones which jump in the ship and watch it sink .
 
Why is this happening ? Greed !
 
1. Greed from developers big small new old , typically the small ones which think they can jump on the bandwagon and sell . The biggest ones have enough cash to hold those empty units. Always the smaller ones with no experiences which takes the first hit..
 
2. Greed from property speculators thinking they can make a quick buck from an investment without thinking whether if the timing is right. Especially dumbos which think economies will forever go up.
 
3. Greed from the garmen to sell land at ex prices and not stop the sharp property rises which makes living in singapore so tough and now despite everything we are the most expensive in the world. So is our ministers. Look at their pay , they need to justify their pay , these people are no longer doing things for the people but themselves.
 
4. Greed from property agents , many claim to be gurus after they made easy money from 2009 thinking that they can flip a few units and make , now only to vomit all of those and sitting on a pile of debts. Why i know ? My job.
 
5. Greed from banks , loose loans from easy money makes every feel rich when they aren't. Anyone can easily have cash of up to more than 10x their earnings.
 
 
So who is crying?? Everyone. Those who aren't are those holding cash or debt free. oh ya and those which missed the bandwagon and hoping for everything to crash for them.

The selldown is happening now. It should have started earlier but instead started later becos of many many preventive moves to "bluff" the market.  The intensity which should have been stronger is more gradual becos of the extended low rates.

Seriously , easy money is never a good way to grow business , everyone knows that. Why would i be crying mother and father when i already expected it to happen?
 
The ones which are crying are the ones which jump in the ship and watch it sink .
 
Why is this happening ? Greed !
 
1. Greed from developers big small new old , typically the small ones which think they can jump on the bandwagon and sell . The biggest ones have enough cash to hold those empty units. Always the smaller ones with no experiences which takes the first hit..
 
2. Greed from property speculators thinking they can make a quick buck from an investment without thinking whether if the timing is right. Especially dumbos which think economies will forever go up.
 
3. Greed from the garmen to sell land at ex prices and not stop the sharp property rises which makes living in singapore so tough and now despite everything we are the most expensive in the world. So is our ministers. Look at their pay , they need to justify their pay , these people are no longer doing things for the people but themselves.
 
4. Greed from property agents , many claim to be gurus after they made easy money from 2009 thinking that they can flip a few units and make , now only to vomit all of those and sitting on a pile of debts. Why i know ? My job.
 
5. Greed from banks , loose loans from easy money makes every feel rich when they aren't. Anyone can easily have cash of up to more than 10x their earnings.
 
 
So who is crying?? Everyone. Those who aren't are those holding cash or debt free. oh ya and those which missed the bandwagon and hoping for everything to crash for them.

 
Well said! But I think you might have mistaken my point. I, too, have sidelined since the announcement of TDSR as I don't want to be those pigs waiting to be slaughtered like you just said. I'm now holding on to cash and I'm in no rush to go in again. Can wait several years while enjoying the fruit of my labor.

Sales of five-room and executive flats have been the worst hit by the shrinking Housing Board resale market.Not only are fewer of these large flats being sold, but they are also taking more than twice as long to find buyers, compared with five years ago.This is despite prices falling since the start of last year. The median cost of a five-room flat inSengkang, for example, was $495,500 in the second quarter of this year, down from $523,000 at the start of last year

bad times - good to buy cos can negotiate lower price
 
good times - also good to buy cos price will go up later
 
U mean during bad time or good time, transaction level will become zero meh?

Leng Beng's elder son buys Jervois Rd GCB for S$18.8m
This works out to about S$1,247 psf for 15,073 sq ft of freehold land

Prime property: The bungalow at the confluence of Jervois Road and Tanglin Road is said to have six en suite bedrooms and a small swimming pool. The total built-up area is around 7,600 sq ft. Mr Sherman Kwek is said to be buying the property from a couple

GCB transactions


[sINGAPORE] Sherman Kwek, chief investment officer of City Developments, has picked up a Good Class Bungalow for S$18.8 million. This works out to about S$1,247 per square foot on freehold land area of about 15,073 square feet.
Sitting on an elevated, triangular-shaped site near the confluence of Jervois Road and Tanglin Road, the two-storey bungalow is said to have six en suite bedrooms and a small swimming pool. The total built-up area is around 7,600 sq ft.
Mr Kwek, who is in his late 30s, is said to be buying the property from a couple. He exercised the option for the purchase last month.
Based on caveats information, this would be the fourth time the property is changing hands in the past 11 years. It was previously transacted in 2003, 2006 and 2007.
Mr Kwek is the elder son of City Developments and Singapore Hong Leong Group executive chairman Kwek Leng Beng. He is also a council member of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
In another GCB deal, motoring tycoon Peter Kwee is believed to have exercised an option last month for the purchase of a house in Gallop Park for S$25.2 million, translating into S$1,574 psf on land area of about 16,010 sq ft.
Mr Kwee is understood to be buying the property as trustee for another party. Under a complex deal, the seller - who is understood to be formerly from China, have completed his university education here and to be now a Singaporean - is said to have granted an option in the fourth quarter of last year.
The two-storey Gallop Park bungalow has about 7,000 sq ft built-up area; it has six bedrooms and a swimming pool. The property is believed to have been renovated a few years ago. The latest deal would mark the fifth time the property is changing hands in the past eight years; the earlier transactions were at about S$7.5 million in March 2006, S$12.3 million in July 2007, S$13.1 million in September 2008 and S$21 million in December 2010.
Other recent GCB transactions are said to include an option granted recently for an Oriole Crescent property for around S$15.7 million. It has land area of about 10,220 sq ft and built-up area of some 7,000 sq ft.
A property at Dalvey Road is also said to be selling at S$30-plus million. It is said to have five bedrooms in addition to a granny room and a guest room. The bungalow is on nearly 18,490 sq ft of land.
GCBs are the most prestigious type of landed housing in Singapore because of the planning constraints imposed by the Urban Redevelopment Authority, which has designated 39 locations on mainland Singapore as Good Class Bungalow Areas (GCBAs).
Typically, GCBs have a minimum land area of 1,400 square metres (15,069 sq ft). However, when GCBAs were gazetted in 1980, they included some slightly smaller existing sites. Nonetheless, these are still considered GCBs as they would be bound by the other GCB planning rules if they were to be redeveloped.
For instance, such plots cannot be further sub-divided and they cannot be built more than two storeys high (plus an attic and a basement).
Based on CBRE's analysis of caveats data, 15 deals in GCBAs have been done in the first half of this year totalling slightly over S$344 million, an improvement from just eight deals of S$233 million in the second half of last year.
RealStar Premier Group managing director William Wong notes that prices of GCBs as well as transactions have dropped since the onset of the total debt servicing ratio framework in June last year, as well as the fact that Singapore permanent residents are no longer allowed to buy landed homes in GCBAs.
The latter rule-change is thought to have been introduced sometime in the second half of 2012. "This means the pool of GCB buyers today comprises only Singaporeans," he added.
Even in prime GCBAs such as Chatsworth and Bishopsgate in the Tanglin vicinity, said Mr Wong, prices are now hovering around S$1,600-S$1,800 psf on land area, compared with S$1,800-S$2,000 psf about 18 months ago.
"On a more positive note, following a slow second quarter this year, we are now seeing an increase in viewing activity. There are more potential buyers looking out for good deals; however, not many owners are adjusting prices just yet. I foresee the price-gap will narrow, most likely in the fourth quarter of this year, which is when we will start to see more transactions."

No 1 mil no tok! 
 

Take the case of Ms Sharon Wu, 40, who lives in a 39th-floor five-room unit in City View@Boon Keng.
 
We paid a lot for the flat in 2008, but it was for the location and the million-dollar view, said the project manager who enjoys views of not just the Singapore Flyer and Central Business District, but parts of Batam Island too.
 
She expects the value of her flat  it was $722,000 when she and her husband bought it  to increase to as much as $1 million when it can go on the resale market.

Vacancy is healthy, not getting cancer ok!
 
 
 
 Vacancy rate in private residential market still ‘healthy’

 

Aug 12, 2014
 
 
While the number of completed but unoccupied private homes in Singapore is growing, property watchers believe the vacancy rate is still “healthy”, reported the media.
In fact, they even expect the number to increase over the next few years, with the suburbs witnessing the most significant increase.
In Q2 2014, the vacancy rate of completed private homes rose to its highest level since Q1 2006 at 7.1 percent, according to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).
Notably, vacant units in the private residential market refer to completed units but unsold by developers, or homes purchased by buyers but are unoccupied.
Property watchers noted the present vacancy rate is still healthy for the market.
“Looking at the way prices have been behaving and of course you have the impact of the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) and the cooling measures, it appears that around six to seven percent is the normal or healthy vacancy level in Singapore,” explained Alan Cheong, Senior Director of Research and Consultancy at Savills Singapore.
“But unfortunately, vacancies will increase as more projects get completed in the course of the next couple of years. We may even head towards double-digit levels like 10, 11 percent,” he added.
Including Executive Condominiums (EC), URA expects around 24,893 homes will be completed in 2015 while another 29,582 homes will enter the market in 2016.
In comparison, less than 14,400 homes were completed in 2013 and 20,023 homes will be expected to be completed this year.
With this, Nicholas Mak, Executive Director of Research and Consultancy at SLP International, expects the market to be challenging over the next few years, “especially in some locations where it is not proven as an established leasing market.”
These locations will likely be in the suburban areas and are not located near MRT stations or amenities, said SLP International.

Lets not debate about where the direction is, ok?  It will make us sound so stupid.  Direction is clear, velocity is the one, i said many times already.
 
 
Asking prices do not define a market.
Or else we would all be billionaires.
 
As the "professional", you should know that even within a small market like Singapore, there are several segments.  The drop is happening in various pockets of the market.
Some more than others.
 
If you hv ever heard of the notion, " the trend is your friend" you should know whether its time for an investment property or not.
 
There will still be buyers absolutely as theses constitute real demand (users)
 
The professionals should be advising us as such. Why am i the stupid nincompoop doing the job?  
 
Enjoy the day folks

Simple analysis, dude.
 
Asking $1.3m , can sell?
Now asking $1.25m, can sell?
Fact is, can sell, but probably at $1.15m now.
Going forward a few months from now , maybe $1.15m also cannot sell.
 
If dont sell can?  Can.  Than why even put up for sale?  Trying to catch Robert? Hhmm...there are less nowadays.  Or lets say there are less who can afford to be Roberts.

 Review earlier property curbs: property consultants

 

Aug 13, 2014
 

  Comment E-mail to friend Bookmark & Share

 
Although the government has reiterated that property cooling measures will be kept in place, some real estate consultants are still calling for a review of earlier curbs, which they believe may have become “redundant”, reported the media.
Speaking at the annual National Real Estate Congress yesterday, consultants believe earlier taxes such as the additional buyer’s stamp duty (ABSD) as well as the seller’s stamp duty (SSD) have become less relevant, considering that the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) have effectively kept prices in check.
“I think nobody questions the reason behind the TDSR, but with it being in place for slightly more than a year now, I think it’s time for the Government to start looking at whether some of the earlier measures have become redundant because we have a pretty effective TDSR,” stated Colliers International Managing Director Dennis Yeo.
ERA Key Executive Officer Eugene Lim reckon the SSD has become unnecessary now that the speculative activity in the local property market dropped.
In fact, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) revealed sub-sales accounted for 3.4 percent of the overall sale transactions in Q2 2014, down from Q1’s 4.6 percent.
“The sub-sales number is actually very low across all types of properties, so there is very limited speculation. It could be an opportune time to review the measures aimed at tackling speculative buying and selling, which is essentially the SSD. Is it necessary anymore at this stage?” said Lim.
Meanwhile, ABSD for local buyers should either be removed or lowered to allow Singaporeans to acquire second properties, said consultants.
“Since TDSR is already preventing people from over-gearing, I don’t think tweaking ABSD for local buyers will cause prices to shoot up again. Developers also have a lot of stock to clear, so prices can’t shoot up,” noted Lim.

Many people asking many years already still asking.
Why becos looking for Robert.
Why becos agent tell them possible
 
Anyway, who doesnt know what tricks an agent does.
 
To buyer, he say prices going up.
To seller he says prices coming off
Then easy to bridge the gap.
Chey, these tactics who doesnt know?
Therefore, i always talk to owner or buyer direct. It can be in the presence of agent.
No bulls**t.  But of course many folks are too emotional and sentimental about selling their homes so kena play by agent tactics....

no lah, just tell the truth. I say it is possible, never say guarantee right?
 
Surely the owner must know that anything is possible, with transacted price as reference of course 
 
As u said, all these tactics are known to all, so everything is in the open here  

 
haha... earlier this yr, particular d5 condo asking 1.6mil and above for same unit size, recently i check all similar asking only 1.35 mil  [laugh]
 

 
your d5 condo how many sqft and how many BR?
 
asking 1.35m means can deal at 1.15m (according to experts)  

How about, what else can we expect out of real estate agents mouth? Prices of property to drop ?
Muahahaha

 
why not
 
always say that price will rise also very susah. Becomes not so affordable to the average joe
 
say price will drop (2%) gives some comfort to rich singaporeans as they would think they have gotten a nice discount

a $2m PH today was prob worth just $1m 5 years ago.
 
Can your $1.6m be considered lowball? 
 
Will it fall further to $1.3m?

Why do you always use this stupid irrelevant example?
Whats before is before.
 
We talk about current and future.
If it is worth $1.6mil today so be it.
But if it isnt worth $2mil, dont try to bulls**t it to be.
 
Who cares what it was 5 yrs ago? Not me
I care what it will be 1-3 yrs later becos i belong to the investor segment.
Different segment do care about different time horizon.
 
But cash rich investor segment care mostly about next 1-3yrs horizon aka shorter term price movements. 
 
You dont just only make money from buying low selling high.
Its more about when you buy , whether its low or high.
Becos high can be higher and low can be lower.
Its about the direction of the market and how deep into the direction we are.
 
Anyway your twisting prata style of debate, i hereby too sian to engage you any further lah, bro.
You win!
 
All the best to your endeavors.

Direction is clear. CMs curbing speculation in easy credit environment, TDSR preventing families from overextending themselves.
Will probably save a number of ppl from getting burned when/if sh*t hits the fan
 
 
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-13/singapore-housing-purchases-drop-as-rates-poised-to-rise.html
 
 
James Hee, a property agent who lives with his family of four in a government-built flat he owns in Singapore, was eyeing a condo for about S$1.5 million ($1.2 million) earlier this year. Then Hee discovered that he wouldn’t qualify for a mortgage after the government restricted lending.
“Being self-employed, only 70 percent of what I earn is considered for the loan calculation, and with my car loan I can’t get the amount I would need to upgrade,” Hee, 32, said.
Singapore curbed lending after home prices climbed 25 percent between 2006 and 2008. While the measures pushed down prices, they also prevented some Singaporeans, who mostly live in government-financed units that they own, from buying privately built apartments. The central bank said in July that it’s too early to ease property restrictions, a view that some economists support to protect borrowers from an impending rise in interest rates.
“This preemptive step to limit loan liabilities could actually help to buffer a slump as it reduces the number of marginal home owners who may struggle to meet loan obligations and then need to liquidate,” said Vishnu Varathan, an economist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in the city-state. “It’s priming the Singapore market for more resilience when the rate cycle turns.”

no security guard to salute u when u come home, no swimming pool for your maid to swim in the afternoon while u are away at work, 
 
most of all, stay in private means u are one of the elite 30% in SG. If agent can upgrade to private, got a lot of face and dignity to face his clients !

 Slight rise in new private home sales

 

Aug 15, 2014
 
 
Sales of new private homes in Singapore, including executive condominiums (ECs), rose marginally month-on-month to 535 units. In June a total of 531 units were sold according to data published by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).
Excluding ECs, the number of transacted units last month was 484 units.
The best-selling project by the number of units sold in July was City Gate at Beach Road (pictured), which sold 89 units at a median average price of $1,809 psf.
The most expensive property sold in July based on median psf pricing came from a single unit at Clermont Residence in Tanjong Pagar, which transacted at $3,244 psf.
The same month last year produced a total of 594 transacted private homes, including ECs.
A total of 5,365 new private homes, including ECs, have been sold during the first seven months of the year, according to URA data. The first seven months of last year saw a total of 12,562 units transacted according to the same data source – a decline of more than 57 percent year-on-year to date.

so, the take home message here is if looking for a condo for own stay, better look for ulu places that is not targeted for tenancy?
if near mrt means tenancy is high and you got all sort of short term "resident"
sibei unfair leh ... pay million dollar $$ for a condo and experience this kind of treatment like illegal tenant ... nabei
property is location location location
being near city or near mrt is sibei best location but these kind of projects are heavily targeted by investor
buy the unit and throw to market purely for tenancy and dont give a fk who is the tenant ... it's $$ all it matters

This is not out of the ordinary. The managing agent must have done a lousy job. I had a nasty encounter with a condominium manager from DTZ. She was replaced subsequently after I found evidence of her stirring s h i t against me.

Its about the direction of the market and how deep into the direction we are.  before changing direction?

This is the part that many men on the street have diff deciphering leading to deadly outcomes.

Dont think dog's ticks go for human blood.
Its the bedbugs......thats the skull cracking problem.
Almost impossible to fully eradicate. Even pest control dont gauranntee u after they come. Only dare to give 6 mths gaurantee if u follow their instructions............practically throw away at least half of ur wooden furnitures.
 
No prize for guessing which breeds brought bedbugs in abundance to Sg.

Ticks/fleas u can bomb the house kill them all. Yeap, ticks usually won't go for humans. Easy for us to pick them off. Ticks will try to stick to host, bedbugs bite u and run away hide.

so, the take home message here is if looking for a condo for own stay, better look for ulu places that is not targeted for tenancy?
if near mrt means tenancy is high and you got all sort of short term "resident"
sibei unfair leh ... pay million dollar $$ for a condo and experience this kind of treatment like illegal tenant ... nabei
property is location location location
being near city or near mrt is sibei best location but these kind of projects are heavily targeted by investor
buy the unit and throw to market purely for tenancy and dont give a fk who is the tenant ... it's $$ all it matters
 

As an investor you need to consider what kind of tenant you want? 
 
Those near mrt condo...the tenant mix should be very varied..ranging from noisy students.. etc. They might be harder to manage n mess up your place n don't pay in time.
 
Those a bit so called ulu places.. More popular for families... Coz the environment more serene n so caller conducive for families especially with kids. They are usually safer kind of tenant coz pay on time
..N keep your place clean.
 
So investors need to think carefully what kind of tenant they want.
 
I prefer those not that attract family ones cos the condo upkeep is better n when I old Liao can move in to stay as an option.

This is something new.. Ulu condo tenants tends to pay on time.. Near mrt condo tenants tends to be late in payments? You experienced that with both your ulu & near mrt condo?

No lar..I said "might be" and "usually"....
 
I used "so called ulu" is because singaporean investors tend to favor those very near the mrt..like within 700k at most ones..
 
N those not within 700k they labelled it as far or ulu lor.
 
But by definition ulu places should be not near any amenities or schools.shouldn't be judged by mrt only what.as long can accessible by bus can liao.
 
How about this..if you have family n come to a foreign country to live..would you want your family to live in a more "dynamic" n transient neighbors? 
 
Usually the expats with family have bigger pay package housing allowance.
 
You do the maths. ;)

I meant 700 metres.. Not 700k..stupid auto correct.
 
Btw condo for investment should consider those near international schools or good schools.
 
Not only mrt..but dunno why singaporean love mrt lei.
 
But the mrt effect is increasingly irrelevant by 2030..so you should take a long term look when it comes to buying for investment.

 S’pore land prices flat amid strong headwinds

 

Aug 26, 2014
 
 
Land prices across major Asian cities grew at a slower pace in the first six months of 2014, advancing by 4.9 and 2.9 percent for office and residential sites respectively, compared to 9.8 and 7.7 percent during the same period last year, according to Knight Frank.
“One reason for the deceleration is the slowdown in China, although activity also fell across the rest of Asia,” said Nicholas Holt, Research Head for Asia Pacific.
He added: “In H1 2014, investment volumes totalled only 37.6 percent of the amount achieved in the whole of last year.”
Meanwhile, land transaction volumes in Asia dropped five percent year-on-year in H1 2014.
The report also noted that Singapore’s housing market faced strong headwinds, and as a result, land prices here stayed flat.
“In Q2 2014, as compared to the same period last year right before the impact of the Total Debt Servicing Ratio ruling was felt, prices of non-landed houses in (the) Core Central Region dropped 4.8 percent as transactions plunged 52.5 percent, softening demand for land,” said Holt.

 Resale private home prices down 0.3% in July: SPRI

 

Aug 29, 2014
 
 
Resale prices of completed non-landed private homes in Singapore dropped 0.3 percent in July compared to June, revealed the latest flash estimates of the National University of Singapore (NUS)’s Overall Singapore Residential Price Index (SRPI).
Notably, a revised 0.5 percent decline was posted in June.
Prices of small condo and apartment units (up to 506 sq ft) fell 0.8 percent in July compared to June’s 0.7 percent drop.
Home prices in the Central Region, excluding small units, dipped 0.7 percent in July after falling 0.8 percent last month.
However, prices of homes in the Non-Central Region, excluding small units, inched up 0.1 percent in July after easing 0.2 percent in June.
The Central Region sub-basket refers to properties located in districts 1 to 4 and the traditional prime districts 9 to 11, while properties found in other postal districts are in the Non-Central Region sub-basket.

High end developer going to wait for one and half years before deciding want to cut price or not
 
I wholeheartedly agree that developers should not cut price. Instead, give the poor agents another 5% more commission to motivate them to work harder to bring buyers in  
 
 	Cutting luxury home prices can backfire: Wing Tai chairmanBy Lee Yen Nee POSTED: 29 Aug 2014 08:37Mr Cheng Wai Keung explains rationale for holding its valuation of its new Ardmore Park project, despite having sold just 3 of 43 units.

SINGAPORE: Slashing prices is not the best way to increase sales in the luxury home segment despite the current property climate, as developers risk tarnishing the brand image of their offerings, said Wing Tai Holdings chairman Cheng Wai Keung on Thursday (Aug 28).
 
This is one of the reasons the company has not taken that option with its freehold Ardmore Park project, Le Nouvel Ardmore. Wing Tai has sold only three of the 43 units on offer but, under the Qualifying Certificate, it has until mid-2016 to sell all the units.
 
“There is no point in lowering the price … it’s almost like retail — you don’t see the high-end, luxury products on a fire sale. If LVMH does that, it is destroying its brand. In the high-end segment, you’re selling a brand image; not for utility. If it’s for utility, you can never sell at that kind of price,” said Mr Cheng. “We still have one-and-a-half years for Le Nouvel Ardmore. We will hold our price and wait until that time to make a decision.”

Sentosa is a flop, $2800psf to $1400psf now and still not moving....  But then it was way over priced in the first place, a bubble.  
 
Even Sky Habitat has cut price from $1700 psf to $1200-1400psf.  Those who bought earlier sure cry father cry mother or they can tell themselves it is a really long term investment, no problem, property sure makes money one.

actually can consider sentosa if really at 1400psf and can afford 2000-3000sqft.. That like 2.8 to 4mil+.. But the 3 bedder monthly conservancy cost is like $1600-1800 per month..

Sentosa is a lifestyle product.  Not near public transport, so a big family will need a few cars or dad becomes the chauffeur often.  Better pay slightly more for a D9-11 freehold property.  It is for the truly rich and not for commoners like me, ieven if I can afford it.

 Challenging times ahead for shoebox landlords

 

Sep 3, 2014
 
 
Landlords of shoebox apartments located outside the city centre will find it “challenging” to rent out their units once the influx of new homes enters the market next year, said experts quoted in the media.
Most of the 53,900 new condo units set to hit the market over the next 30 months are small or shoebox apartments, or units measuring up to 506 sq ft.
“Owners of such units for investment would not be as successful at getting the kind of rentals they want going forward,” said Desmond Sim, Research Head at CBRE.
“There will be pressure on vacancies, as they will be facing competition from the broader market too.”
While there are no official figures on the number of shoebox units in the market, in September 2012 the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) estimated that there were around 2,400 completed units as at 2011, with the number climbing to 11,000 by the end of next year.
From 2009 to 2012, shoebox units featured heavily at newly launched projects including the 72-unit Suites@Guillemard in Lim Ah Woo Road, the 138-home Parc Imperial in Pasir Panjang Road and the 293-unit Alexis in Alexandra Road.
Although they tend to have a higher psf price due to their small size, investors find the overall quantum “more palatable, especially amid tightened financing”, noted Chia Siew Chuin, Director of Research and Advisory at Colliers International.
Typically, rental yields of shoebox units range from three to four percent, up from the two to three percent yields for residential developments islandwide.
However, experts warn investors looking to acquire shoebox apartments that rents for such units are expected to moderate in line with the flood of newly completed homes.

I think Iskandar properties are more owner occupied. Do you have data to support this theory? I look and look and I cannot fathom why investors would want to park their money there

i don't think so. At least from the buyers who i interacted with, (most) singaporeans who buy iskandar condos just wanna flip or rent out
 
those who want to stay there typically look for landed at east ledang/ horizon hills etc
 
i too also cannot fathom why, but u can't use reason to stop a rampaging herd from running u over right?

A consortium comprising Hoi Hup Realty, Sunway Developments and Oriental Worldwide Investments submitted the next highest bid of $202.9 million, while Verwood Holdings and TID Residential jointly bid for the land at around $197 million.
Head of Singapore’s CBRE Research Desmond Sim said, “The number of bids and close winning margin indicate the healthy interest in the EC market, despite current market conditions. This is coupled by the establishment of the vicinity as a matured housing estate with a myriad of amenities. The bid price also reflects the confidence of the developers in the mid to long term for the EC market, bolstered by steady underlying demand.”
The land parcel measures 19,058.0 sq m and is next to Chua Chu Kang Secondary School.
HDB will announce the award of the tender soon.

Wow since when did Tiong Bahru suddenly command D9 price? Response has been good some more  
 
All loaded singaporeans, ready to chiong ! (first come first serve, no more units don't cry hor    )
 

 
 
 
Highline Residences, Keppel Land’s condominium project in Tiong Bahru, is expected to launch on 13 September coinciding with the opening of the showflat for Marina One Residences, according to media reports.
Although a Keppel Land spokesperson declined to confirm the date, she said, “we have given a market guide price of $2,000 psf (on average) and response has been good.” The guide price excludes an unspecified “special preview discount” for registered buyers who have viewed the units prior to the official launch.
Last weekend, potential buyers were invited to view the development, and another session will be held this weekend.
Including the discounts, the average price at Highline Residences could range from $1,800 to $1,900 psf, according to market observers.

Alright! Sales volume will chiong through Sep...  
 
 
 
 More launches expected in coming months

 

Sep 8, 2014
 
 
 
As it was seen as an inauspicious time to buy property during the seventh lunar month, which fell in August, developers are expected to launch more private residential projects in September and October, according to experts as reported in the media.
These include Keppel Land’s Highline Residences in Tiong Bahru which was previewed in the past two weekends. The guide price for the 500-unit project stands at $2,000 psf.
To attract more customers, Keppel Land is offering concierge services to buyers, such as housekeeping and limousine services, plus membership at a golf club in Bintan.
Another major project slated to be launched is the Marina One Residences (pictured) by M+S, a joint venture between Temasek and Khazanah Nasional. The development is anticipated to be released on 13 September, with indicative prices averaging at $2,600 psf.
ERA Realty’s Key Executive Officer Eugene Lim explained the peak periods for housing sales occur after the Chinese New Year and Hungry Ghost Month. “Most developers will capitalise on this second peak window to clear as many units as they can before this year-end lull,” he added.
Meanwhile, several Executive Condominiums (ECs) are expected to come on stream after a hiatus of nearly one year.
Developers of two EC sites at Punggol’s Anchorvale Crescent and Woodlands Avenue 5 are set to unveil their projects. In fact, construction of the Woodlands Avenue condo has started and online applications will begin by end-September. Prices are expected to fall within $750 to $820 psf.
Additionally, three other ECs in Punggol and Jurong West are scheduled to debut in November. Altogether, these developments will have around 2,900 units.

wah ... against all odds ... buck the trend ... jump 4.8%
 

Posh private condos buck the trend as resale prices climb 4.8% in August 
Resale volume inched up 1.2% year-on-year.
 
Private condominium units in the Core Central Region are bucking the country’s falling price trend. The Singapore Real Estate Exchange’s August 2014 Private Residential Flash Report revealed that non-landed private residential resale prices were up slightly by 0.4% in August compared to July 2014.
 
Condos in the CCR and RCR drove the overall index up with price gains of 4.8% and 1.5%, respectively. In comparison, resale prices of units in OCR decreased 1.1%.
 
Year-on-year, prices have dropped 5.0% from August 2013. Prices have declined 5.3% since the recent peak in Jan 2014.
 
Meanwhile, resale volume remained flat as an estimated 418 Non-landed Private Residential units were resold in August, levelled with 417 transacted units in July.
 
Year-on-year, resale volume improved 1.2% compared with 413 units resold in August 2013, while it is down 79.6% compared to its peak of 2,050 units resold in April 2010.

Singapore - Home prices here could fall 20 per cent by 2016, depending on how the Government moves on its economic restructuring policies and property cooling measures, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has said in a new report.

No sorcery required.
 
Most agents read and translate reports and information out of context or simply to their advantage.
Just as they would tell a seller that the market sucks and to a buyer that the market is shining.
 
Read the news again.  Prices moving up just due to a few sales at already LOWERED prices doesnt mean a change of direction.   
 
Markets dont move in a complete straight line.
Not when its going up nor when its coming down.
But when put together, the direction is still clear.  Downwards.
 
Anyway, respect to the one who puts money where his mouth is, either ways.
That, compared to those who make hell lot of noise but never execute .
 
Those who think it is going up and up and up.
 Plese leverage and buy more lah! Waiting for what?
 I dont understand leh?... Waiting for f**k?

But the teacher assured me that it is DOWN if you take into consideration everything

the author does not seem to appreciate property economics 101. a slump in the market does not lead to poorer economy and jobs loss. should be the other way round

 Highline Residences receives positive response

 

Sep 15, 2014
 
 
Highline Residences, Keppel Land’s latest condominium project in Tiong Bahru, received good response from homebuyers during its closed-door preview sales over the weekend, said media reports.
Notably, over 80 percent of the first 160 units released were sold at an average price of $1,900 after taking into account a special preview discount, which ranged from $28,000 to $68,000. The project offers 500 units in total.
The price was in line with market watcher’s expectations of between $1,800 and $1,900 psf.
“This (positive response) may be due to pent-up demand for new private housing in Tiong Bahru, which has not seen a launch in the past seven years,” noted a Keppel Land spokesperson.
The closed-door sale last weekend was by-invitation-only, and for prospects who registered their interest.
Keppel Land is planning the sales launch of the long awaited project. Located at Kim Tian Road, it is within a few minutes’ walk to Tiong Bahru MRT station and the future Havelock MRT station on the Thomson Line.
According to a recent OCBC report, when The Crest, a condo developed by a Wing Tai consortium located at Prince Charles Crescent near Redhill, was launched in June 2014, only 35 units were sold at a median price of about $1,700 psf over that month.

More owners of luxury condos selling at a loss
Yields also under pressure; low rentals leave more people struggling to pay mortgages
 

 

[sINGAPORE] A larger percentage of high-end luxury condo homes on the resale market are selling at a loss and a smaller percentage at a profit, as the tide of the once-rosy property market recedes and reveals those who have been "swimming naked" - that is, those without adequate holding power for their extravagant purchases.
 
According to data compiled by STProperty.sg from URA Realis, 7 per cent of transacted units in the prime districts 9, 10 and 11 sold at a loss in the first eight months of this year, up from 5.5 per cent over the same year-ago period.
 
Fewer people are profiting from their resales too: only 62.2 per cent enjoyed any capital gains - a steep drop from 83.5 per cent a year ago. And 4.5 per cent sold without making a profit or a loss (versus 0.4 per cent a year ago).
 
Yields are also under pressure. The low-rental environment is leaving more owners struggling to repay their mortgages. Assuming a S$1.6 million loan (equivalent to an 80 per cent loan limit for a S$2 million property) is taken out at an annual 1.5 per cent interest rate over a 30-year tenure, this would amount to a monthly mortgage of S$5,500. Rentals would therefore have to be in excess of this to cover mortgage payments.
 
"In some cases, the monthly rental cannot cover the mortgage. Take a S$5 million Sentosa Cove condo: it would take a monthly rent of S$13,800 to cover your loan," said Christine Li, head of research and consultancy at OrangeTee.
 
"That said, it's quite common that rents cannot cover monthly instalments, especially for bigger units. But those who don't have holding power would have to let go of their units. Others may be forced to do mortgagee sales," she added.
 
But not all the sellers who were willing to stomach losses were over-leveraged. Some could simply want to exit the market because they don't see the cooling measures ending anytime soon (meaning, they expect that price recovery is still far off), or just as a way of rebalancing their overall portfolio.
 
"A large proportion of purchases in the prime districts are by foreigners; perhaps they are just pulling out of Singapore. But the fall in demand for private homes makes it harder for sellers to find buyers. So if they really need to sell, they will have to lower their prices significantly," said Lee Lay Keng, DTZ's Southeast Asia regional head of research.
 
Investors would also have bought into high-end properties in major cities in the US, Europe and Australia, where there have been exciting properties launched in recent years, RST Research director Ong Kah Seng said.
 
In all likelihood, despite pulling out of Singapore, they might have profited elsewhere as other countries saw an uptick in residential property prices after the global financial crisis.
 
Meanwhile, loan curbs and price cutting by developers at new condo launches also continue to sap strength from the resale market.
 
Condo homes in the prime districts 9 (Orchard Road, River Valley), 10 (Bukit Timah, Holland, Balmoral) and 11 (Novena, Newton, Thomson) have traditionally been purchased as investment homes for capital gains and rental yields.
 
Buyers bank on demand from expatriate lessees, most of whom enjoy staying near the city. But with corporate housing budgets having shrunk post-financial crisis, these foreign workers are moving instead to the city fringes and suburbs, with some even renting HDB flats.
 
Losses made in resale transactions from January to August 2014 range from S$9,300 for a unit at The Hillier in Bukit Timah, to S$2.06 million for a unit at St Regis Residences in Tanglin. The latter was purchased at S$6.8 million in 2007, and sold for S$4.7 million in April this year.
Four units at The Promont (at Cairnhill), St Thomas Suites (near River Valley), Tanglin View and Waterscape At Cavenagh also resold at considerable losses of S$800,000 to S$1.2 million each (see table).
 
Notably, there were also four units at Robinson Suites on Shenton Way which resold at losses of about S$300,000.
 
Many of the loss-making resale transactions from the first eight months of this year were from sellers who bought their units in 2007, in the run-up to the previous peak in property prices and just when the financial crisis was starting.
 
Prices of these prime-location condos have recovered since, but dipped back down slightly from 2012 due to cooling measures. As at Q2 2014, prices were roughly on a par with the previous peak in 2008.
This means that not only would buyers who picked up condo units fresh at launch in 2007 not enjoy much capital gains, they may also suffer a loss if they sell now.
 
While analysts expect the trend of loss-making resale transactions to continue, they say it is unlikely to worsen significantly as long as economic conditions - such as low unemployment and interest rates - remain favourable.

one month up, one month down, rinse and repeat haha
 
anyway, sales volume of 8000-9000 for any given year is one of the signs of a property market that is not under pressure to sell
 
For those waiting for price to drop, sales have to be closer to the 6000 level and showflats definitely not like the picture below, even on launch day
 
waited for 9 months this year and price still about the same, dunno if i can even see a 10% drop by end of 2014
 
i think i better wait for 2015, or 2016, or 2017 sia  
 
 
 
 
 September sales expected to spike

 

Sep 16, 2014
 
 
 
While last month’s new private home sales continued to weaken, new sales volume in September is expected to improve from July and August 2014, according to analysts.
For instance, OrangeTee expects sales volumes to be around 750 units to 850 units for September.
The market is likely to experience more deals soon, as anticipated projects such as Highline Residences, and 70 St Patrick’s are expected to launch in September while Marina One is expected to launch in early October.
According to media reports, Highline Residences by Keppel Land has sold over 80 percent of the first 160 units, and Marina One by M+S has also received good response during its private viewing last weekend. Kemmy Tan, CEO at M+S said toPropertyGuru, “Interest has been strong with over 800 visitors to our show gallery over the weekend.”
Alice Tan, Director & Head of Research at Knight Frank Singapore, said, “Developers are also likely to intensify efforts to launch projects with attractive offers to boost sales performance in view of a traditionally quiet year-end period ahead.”
She added, “Buying sentiment for new launches is likely to remain fairly muted in light of the current cooling measures.”
As 2014 approaches its last quarter, analysts believe new private home sales volume for the year is likely to hover around 8,000 to 9,000 units, falling just short of the 10,000-unit mark.
Additionally, PropNex CEO Mohamed Ismail Gafoor expects a cloud of stillness will continue to hang over the high-end segment. “The spotlight will be on more affordable mass and mid-tier market segments. The outlook for the private residential market will continue to be dismal for the rest of 2014 so long as the cooling measures and the TDSR framework remain in their current form,” he said.

SIAO LIAO!
Investors should sell their residential investments in Singapore. The property market, which has been gradually declining, does not need any new action to tip it over. Just the sheer number of new homes being supplied both in Singapore and Iskandar will drive prices lower.
 
New private home sales in Singapore have plunged in the past three months to about 40 per cent of the monthly average of the past five years or so.
 
Since January 2010, the average number of homes sold by developers each month has exceeded 1,300 units. The total number of new homes sold in June, July and August were 531, 560 and 490, respectively, including executive condominiums (EC). Excluding the hybrid housing type, the respective numbers were 482, 509, and 432, respectively, Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and Century 21 (IPA) data showed.
 
Given seasonal factors, such as the Hungry Ghost Month and the quadrennial football World Cup, the three months of dismal private home sales will not be sufficient to render the residential sector a bear market. However, the downward trend can be confirmed by several other indicators.
 
The Housing and Development Board (HDB)’s resale price index, which has a direct impact on mass market private properties, has fallen 5.4 per cent over the past four quarters.
 
During the same period, the URA’s private residential price index slipped 3.4 per cent. The weakness is also reflected in the rental market, where median private non-landed rentals eased 1.1 per cent in the past four quarters to S$3.79 psf per month. Meanwhile, private residential occupancy rates fell to 92.9 per cent in the second quarter of this year from 93.9 per cent in the third quarter of last year. In absolute terms, the number of vacant units increased to 21,268 in the second quarter of this year from 17,459 in the third quarter of last year.
 
Taken together, it is evident that we experienced a slow decline over the past year. Will this gradual weakening lead to a soft landing? Or are we about to fall off the edge of a cliff? As a practising real estate agent, I find it tougher to hold up high rents for landlords. With the rising vacancy rates amid a stream of newly-completed properties, the competition for tenants is intense, especially with the Government tightening foreign employment.
 
Although some landlords have yet to tune themselves to this new reality, others have reacted quickly ahead of next year’s record high supply, which will further pressure rents.
 
Supply of HDB, EC UNITS and Private Residences
In the past 10 years, Singapore has added about 8,000 new private residential units per year. But next year, we can expect about 22,000 units to be completed and 24,000 the year after and at least 16,000 in 2017. The pressure on rents will be overwhelming. Lifting the property curbs will not help fill vacant apartments and improve rents.
 
The expected supply of new HDB flats and ECs is large as well. More than 25,000 units will be completed every year over the next three years. There are also many second-time new HDB buyers and those who are upgrading to ECs who are required by law to sell their current HDB flats when they collect the keys to their new flats or ECs. Unless a few of the cooling measures are lifted and the foreigner employment policies are relaxed, the HDB Resale Price Index and the URA Residential Price Index are set to decline at a faster pace with the onslaught of new, completed home completions, even after taking into account the need for infrastructure to keep pace with population growth.
 
Supply in Iskandar
We must also not forget the promise of lower-cost properties across the Causeway in Iskandar.
The numerous Iskandar residential projects launched in Singapore since 2010, in locations such as Puteri Harbour, Danga Bay, Tebrau, Medini, etc, are now being completed.
They are ready to compete for tenants from Singapore seeking to reduce their housing costs and who do not mind making the commute between the countries. I estimate that over the next four years, about 10,000 new homes will be added per year in Iskandar and some of these will find tenants from Singapore with their attractive rents.
In the past six months, there has been an increase in the number of mortgagee home sales, with several headline-grabbing ones involving luxury condominiums in Sentosa Cove and the prime District 9. During the luxury property boom from 2006 to 2008, about 60 per cent of top-end apartments were purchased by foreigners. Some have held on to their investments, but they are now feeling stifled as a result of the multiple rounds of cooling measures, weak property demand and the restricted ability to refinance under the current regime.
 
For those who are willing to take a long-term view, say, 15 years and beyond, landed homes and high-quality freehold properties in Districts 9 and 10 would remain safe bets as these sub-segments are limited in terms of current stock and future supply.
 
As for now and the immediate future, as I forecast in a commentary in this column last year (“The price war has begun”, Nov 8, 2013), sellers are lowering prices and this will continue to take its toll on investors.
 
I recommend that investors sell their residential investments before they are engulfed by the tidal wave of new supply.

This is the first time I came across someone from property line recommending SELL!  I agree with him.

Finally someone from the property sector singing the exact same song as me.
 
1. Direction is clear , down
2. Real demand will always be there but that alone cannot hold up flooded market
3. Lifting CMs cannot prevent a crash when over supply is the reason.  
 
Even a starving person will stop eating when he is totally full. With so much food on the table, scared hungry? 
 
Can continue eating? Can!!!

THE property market's woes have spread from the luxury sector to more modestly priced homes on the city fringe as new loan curbs keep buyers in check.
Unsold units are piling up in areas such as Bukit Merah, Kallang and Marine Parade, with developers forced to dangle big discounts to move homes.
However, bucking the trend, UOL Group's 186-unit Seventy St Patrick's in Marine Parade sold about 100 units at an average $1,630 per sq ft at a private launch at the weekend, a spokesman said.
Homes in the area - dubbed the "rest of the central region" (RCR) in industry jargon - are right in the price range that leaves many buyers struggling to raise a mortgage, in the light of new rules that restrict lending.
"Developers of suburban condos have not needed to slash prices as most HDB upgraders find launch prices of about $1,000 per sq ft (psf) affordable. But developers of RCR non-landed homes have had to cut prices to fit the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) limits of buyers," said R'ST Research director Ong Kah Seng.
Wealthy buyers of properties in the central city area generally do not require a loan and so are not affected by the TDSR, he added.
The city fringe area had 414 completed but unsold units islandwide as at June 30. This was 29 per cent of the national total and up from the 20 per cent or 250 such units at the end of last year.
The central city area accounted for 63 per cent of such units as at June 30, down from 70 per cent at the end of last year.
Colliers International research director Chia Siew Chuin believes the build-up in completed but unsold units on the city fringe could be due to the recent completion of large-scale projects.
"It is also more challenging to find buyers for projects in the (area) where homes are generally pricier than mass market condominium developments, especially in the light of the current weak market sentiment," said Ms Chia.
There were about 300 units left unsold in total at the 1,040-unit The Interlace in Depot Road and the 360-unit Concourse Skyline in Beach Road as at June 30. The Interlace obtained its temporary occupation permit (TOP) in the third quarter of last year, while Concourse Skyline received it in the first quarter of this year.
 
As at the end of last month, just six units had been sold at the 41-unit Riverside Melodies in St Michael's Road, which received its TOP in the second quarter.
Project launches on the city fringe have had a mixed reception as well. About a week ago, the 500-unit Highline Residences in Tiong Bahru sold about 80 per cent of the first 160 units released.
But the picture at older launches is less rosy. The 56-unit Cosmo Loft in Balestier, launched in May last year, had sold just five units as at Aug 31.
The 128-unit Fulcrum in Fort Road, which started selling units in April 2012, has moved just 17 units with its last sale in May last year. #1 Suites in Geylang, on the market for over a year, had sold just 38 of 112 units as at the end of last month.
"The pool of buyers who can afford RCR properties has definitely shrunk. Unit sizing and price quantum are even more critical areas to consider today to achieve sustainable sales," said Knight Frank Singapore research head Alice Tan.
She noted that while the cost of a 680 sq ft two-bedder home in this area tends to range from $1,600 to just over $1,800 psf, or $1 million to $1.3 million, "any price beyond $1.3 million would be a stretch for many people".
Before the TDSR, some leasehold apartments had even been launched at nearly $2,000 psf, added Mr Ong. Alex Residences in Alexandra and Sky Vue in Bishan, which were both launched in the second half of last year, have sold at average prices of $1,640 psf and $1,576 psf respectively, "way below (the prices of units in) the nearby projects launched before them, before TDSR", he said. As at the end of last month, Alex Residences had sold 214 of 429 units and Sky Vue 504 of 694.
Consultants noted that while sales momentum on the city fringe has slowed in line with overall market performance, developers have adjusted their expectations. The 99-year-leasehold Sky Habitat, for example, sold 120 units from April to last month. Prices have gone down from a median of $1,593 psf at the launch in April 2012 to $1,354 psf last month, said Ms Chia. It had sold just one unit at $1,530 psf from January to March.

However, bucking the trend, UOL Group's 186-unit Seventy St Patrick's in Marine Parade sold about 100 units at an average $1,630 per sq ft at a private launch at the weekend, a spokesman said.
 
 
Homes in the area - dubbed the "rest of the central region" (RCR) in industry jargon - are right in the price range that leaves many buyers struggling to raise a mortgage, in the light of new rules that restrict lending.
 
 
"Developers of suburban condos have not needed to slash prices as most HDB upgraders find launch prices of about $1,000 per sq ft (psf) affordable. But developers of RCR non-landed homes have had to cut prices to fit the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) limits of buyers," said R'ST Research director Ong Kah Seng.
 
 
Wealthy buyers of properties in the central city area generally do not require a loan and so are not affected by the TDSR, he added.
 
 
The city fringe area had 414 completed but unsold units islandwide as at June 30. This was 29 per cent of the national total and up from the 20 per cent or 250 such units at the end of last year.
 
 
The central city area accounted for 63 per cent of such units as at June 30, down from 70 per cent at the end of last year.
Colliers International research director Chia Siew Chuin believes the build-up in completed but unsold units on the city fringe could be due to the recent completion of large-scale projects.
 
 
"It is also more challenging to find buyers for projects in the (area) where homes are generally pricier than mass market condominium developments, especially in the light of the current weak market sentiment," said Ms Chia.
 
 
There were about 300 units left unsold in total at the 1,040-unit The Interlace in Depot Road and the 360-unit Concourse Skyline in Beach Road as at June 30. The Interlace obtained its temporary occupation permit (TOP) in the third quarter of last year, while Concourse Skyline received it in the first quarter of this year.
 
As at the end of last month, just six units had been sold at the 41-unit Riverside Melodies in St Michael's Road, which received its TOP in the second quarter.
 
 
Project launches on the city fringe have had a mixed reception as well. About a week ago, the 500-unit Highline Residences in Tiong Bahru sold about 80 per cent of the first 160 units released.
 
 
But the picture at older launches is less rosy. The 56-unit Cosmo Loft in Balestier, launched in May last year, had sold just five units as at Aug 31.
 
 
The 128-unit Fulcrum in Fort Road, which started selling units in April 2012, has moved just 17 units with its last sale in May last year. #1 Suites in Geylang, on the market for over a year, had sold just 38 of 112 units as at the end of last month.
"The pool of buyers who can afford RCR properties has definitely shrunk. Unit sizing and price quantum are even more critical areas to consider today to achieve sustainable sales," said Knight Frank Singapore research head Alice Tan.
 
 
She noted that while the cost of a 680 sq ft two-bedder home in this area tends to range from $1,600 to just over $1,800 psf, or $1 million to $1.3 million, "any price beyond $1.3 million would be a stretch for many people".
 
 
Before the TDSR, some leasehold apartments had even been launched at nearly $2,000 psf, added Mr Ong. Alex Residences in Alexandra and Sky Vue in Bishan, which were both launched in the second half of last year, have sold at average prices of $1,640 psf and $1,576 psf respectively, "way below (the prices of units in) the nearby projects launched before them, before TDSR", he said. As at the end of last month, Alex Residences had sold 214 of 429 units and Sky Vue 504 of 694.
 
 
Consultants noted that while sales momentum on the city fringe has slowed in line with overall market performance, developers have adjusted their expectations. The 99-year-leasehold Sky Habitat, for example, sold 120 units from April to last month. Prices have gone down from a median of $1,593 psf at the launch in April 2012 to $1,354 psf last month, said Ms Chia. It had sold just one unit at $1,530 psf from January to March.

Gulp!
 
Dude, dont scare the retail mass market crowd leh.  
To them the property prices will forever go up.

It is becoming harder than ever for Housing Board upgraders to make the leap to private property, despite softening prices.
 

The price gap between an HDB flat and one in a private condo has widened, hampering those who rely on resale proceeds to fund their new home - not least in the light of tougher home loan curbs.
 
A 2011 Goldman Sachs study found that the price gap in the first quarter of that year was $490 per sq ft, a record then. That means a 1,000 sq ft condominium unit would have cost $490,000 more than a resale HDB flat with the same floor area.
 
A five-room HDB flat is slightly larger than 1,000 sq ft.
 
..........
 
 

 

DREAM A LITTLE LONGER
It does mean that private housing for HDB upgraders is becoming more unaffordable.
- SLP International Property Consultants research head Nicholas Mak, on buyers having to fork out more
 
DREAM FULFILLED
Many HDB upgraders have already fulfilled their dreams of upgrading.
- R'ST Research director Ong Kah Seng, who does not see the growing price gap between HDB and condo units as cause for alarm

Private condo is a luxury.
The third biggest mistake is to think that everyone should own one.
The second biggest mistake is to think that it is the garment responsibility to help everyone own one
The biggest mistake is the garment actually introducing policies and schemes to help everyone own one.

http://www.todayonline.com/voices/cooling-measures-will-let-property-market-correct-itself
 
 
 
 

 
While I do not disagree about the effects of panic selling in a property bubble, I disagree that the situation necessitates action from our authorities, as recommended in the letter “Curb supply to avert dangers of a burst property bubble” (Sept 23).
Firstly, over a 15-year period, property prices have more than doubled, with the hottest growth in the past five years — small wonder then that Singaporeans have relatively hefty mortgages now.
 
Even a modest 1,000sqf apartment exceeds S$1 million.
 
This is clearly untenable. While the authorities had instituted a series of cooling measures, it was the last one, the Total Debt Servicing Ratio of 60 per cent, that is proving to be the most effective.
 
Secondly, the surge in supply — 83,633 upcoming private homes (and 21,268 currently vacant units) — peaking next year and in 2016 was anticipated. Buyers, developers and banks went in with their eyes open.
 
On top of that, it was known that only about 8,000 private units were added annually in the past 10 years.
 
Thirdly, home ownership is a big, long-term investment for every family; decisions taken must be thought through. Singapore has public housing and there is no shame if one cannot afford or is not ready to buy private property.
 
Finally, those who leveraged to buy a home for occupancy will endure the ups and downs of the market, which are but paper gains or losses.
 
The real pain is for buyers of two or more properties with sizeable loans. In wanting quick riches, these borrowers could pay the price for any major downward correction through a potential default or top-up required by the bank for mortgage security.
 
Unfortunately, buyers who lacked financial prudence would similarly have to pay for rushing into the then red-hot market.
 
But the authorities have taken the correct steps.
 
There would have been a drastic collapse eventually if the market had been allowed to operate unchecked in the past few years. A correction is now timely, accentuated by the oversupply, declining rental opportunities and rising interest rates.
 
Unlike in the United States, most Singaporeans are generally conservative and prudent, which explains why our banks are paying less than 1.5 per cent for time deposits.If the market corrects substantially, it gives new opportunities for these conservative Singaporeans to buy a private property at an affordable price, creating a new market and a consequential pick-up in demand.

"in explaining why the cooling measures are still needed, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) cited that prices went up 60 per cent over the last four years but have declined by just 3.3 per cent over the last three quarters.
 
What puzzles me is why the bottom of the last property cycle in 2009Q2 was chosen for the comparison. Why not choose the peak in 2008Q2, which were the prices before the disruption of the Global Financial Crisis, for the comparison? The increase would then be only 22% over 5 years or about 4% a year, not unreasonably high.
 
In assessing whether our property prices are too high, we should be focusing on the long term and not on the short term fluctuations. Taking the market peak in 2013Q3, we can compute the increase in property prices over various time periods."
 
A lot of us hope for the prices to drop...for the market corrects substantially, coz it gives new opportunities for these conservative Singaporeans to buy a private property at an affordable price, creating a new market and a consequential pick-up in demand.
 
With the ASEAN 2015 in place next dec n if the price do drop a lot...there will be lots of foreigners rushing in to buy..singaporeans will have to compete with them to buy then.
 
Nonetheless if the money has been devalued by so much..all thanks to mass money printing by our banks n this happened when at the same time.... property has crashed on such low levels then it means Singaporeans.. Majority hdb dwellers... Will be holding on to very devalued hdb flats.
 
Hdb, Ec, Condo and landed prices all correlated. When hdb price shots up or crashed..the rest will follow. 
 
Will government want that scenerion to happen?
 
And if the affordability has been the crux of the problem.. 
 
If you are the developer.. How would you react?  Continue to mint smaller sized property? To keep the quantum affordable? 
 
If you are the government...how can you ensure that the people severely eroded purchase power is restored? Continue push for the economic reform n restructure while pushing up the local wages at the same time? 
 
What would you do?
 
What do you think? Too overly simplistic? Too naive?
 
What I do know is that the prices of commodities have shot up a lot in the recent years. My $1 cant buy much this year..or the next.
 
Think.
just think about it.

Well if i look around my friends circle, a lot of them want to buy private properties but still waiting on the sidelines.
Not because they can't afford it, but just waiting for better value proposition.
 
So once price is corrected more substantially or government abolished some cooling measures they will jump in.
 
Hopefully these will support the market and form some kind of a soft landing rather than hard crash.

2. How many of your friends
3. Will they need to take at least 50% loan
4. Is it investment property or to live in?

What would you do?
 
What do you think? Too overly simplistic? Too naive?
 
What I do know is that the prices of commodities have shot up a lot in the recent years. My $1 cant buy much this year..or the next.
 
Think.
just think about it.

 
If you're thinking that a plunge in property prices will severely erode the purchasing power of people, you're wrong. A declining property market improves the PPR http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power
 
PPR is just how much you can get for a given amount of money. Currently, where it stands, one can only get a MM for $1M. That's the current PPR and I would say is pretty pathetic. Poor peaseants.
 
Property needs to take the plunge! The prudent will not suffer. The rash will take a beating.

Well if i look around my friends circle, a lot of them want to buy private properties but still waiting on the sidelines.
Not because they can't afford it, but just waiting for better value proposition.
 
So once price is corrected more substantially or government abolished some cooling measures they will jump in.
 
Hopefully these will support the market and form some kind of a soft landing rather than hard crash.

 
True but you can't always assume a soft landing. There could be two outcomes.
 
1. Small correction will cause those waiting on the sidelines to go in. Result is not much price adjustment.
 
2. A larger correction or drastic move from the govt will cause everyone to be wary. Those waiting will wait longer, lest that he catches a falling knife. And I can tell you most will miss the boat and will never be able to go in.
 
So it can either be flat (#1) or plunge (#2).

It's the eroded purchasing power that causes the commonalities prices to go up.
 
Most people realise this n start to pour their money into properties to preserve their wealth.
 
N is this phenomenon of high property prices only unique to Singapore or around the world?
 
Some buy not to rent out. They buy to keep it empty.
 
Why China is shoring up gold reserves? Why the ultra rich still snap up properties around the world? 
 
Why the bank "inject" funds into the economy?  when there's more money in the system what does it mean?
 
Did the supply of money in Singapore goes up or down? Did it coincide with the increase of property prices?
 
Every property cycle is different. Government can't stop the external factors to shock our system n economy. But it's disastrous if they crash the property prices only for it to break during the black Swan event.

All developers will say they will increase price for the subsequent launch phases.
It's to make buyers feel they're losing out if they don't buy now.
But in the end it's all about supply and demand, if the take up rate decreases they will have to stay with current prices or even lower it later.
It's buyers market now.
 
Although, location wise highline is very nice, will be the last private condo built in TB MRT for a while.

Haha yeah, lots of people missed the boat in 2009 because they were waiting for too long.
If prices dropped a lot again in future, they will wait again like you said and will miss the boat .....again haha.

Sometimes, I feel policy makers must declare their property holdings (direct and indirect).
 
If as a policy maker with direct influence and as a beneficial owner of multiple properties, how can you expect the public not have doubts when you sit by and allow property to run so far ahead?

You didn't look hard enough.  
There are still 797 sqft units going for 810k+, 1033 sqft units for 900k+. Location next to sea n right next to an international school formally located at orchard. Mrt 3 bus stops away.
 
Just that typical singaporeans mostly go for condos near mrt stations only.

As mentioned earlier..most singaporeans investors only look for condos near mrt For investment. 
If you are looking for ready pool of tenants... You should look out for international schools with no dormitory too.Hence..
 
It's not cheap since it's just right next I.E just a road across.. to an international school which is being relocated from orchard. Its kindergarten teacher pay starts at least 6k. It's a huge complex.
 
It's not cheap since its not far from mrt..with amenities such as 24hr supermarket coffeeshops etc just behind it. Yet it's near the sea.
 
It's not cheap since it's fresh 99 lease
lease. It's top is estimated to be within 2years.
 
But it's still reasonably priced since there are plans for mrt soon..just not announced. N not surrounded by hdbs or other condos. Mid sized development of 460+ units compared to 600+ or 900+ mass market condo. 
 
N that it's not built by "famous" big boys like far east, uol etc.

9xx sqft for 900k-ish 
 
Just that by the time Top in 2019, the property already aged by 11years..The developer didn't top up the lease.
 
N with lots of bay windows n planters...it's units are smaller than the other developments. N it's surrounded by 3000+ other condo units..so rents will be pressured due to high competition.

The real pain is for buyers of two or more properties with sizeable loans. In wanting quick riches, these borrowers could pay the price for any major downward correction through a potential default or top-up required by the bank for mortgage security.
 
 

 
The last people we have to worry about is those with 2 or more properties.

Haha the devs are on the same bed as the govt. Govt may bail them out but companies like CDL also have inventories overseas like China. Their time will come and govt will be grilled again for loosing tax payers' money. Best way out for Govt then is to allow one to fail.

Both projects very far east. The limelight has not fallen upon the first development is because most singaporeans looking at condos near mrt. Not near international schools.
 
The 2 bedders are slowly being snapped up. Think sold out for the 2nd development... Left only the 1st development... Which is slowly but surely moving. 
 
If the government casts its attention to the west and north..then look elsewhere coz all the subsequent condo projects in west and north would already have priced into these units.
 
If you are looking for long term investment....Always remember.... foresight not hindsight.
 
cos once the government shifts it's attention to the rest of the region... Then the prices of the existing units or further projects will raise. 
 
By then your investment would have reaped it's rewards.

For 11 out of 34 units sold in District 1, rentals would have been unable to cover the assumed mortgages, said SLP International's Mr Mak. -- ST PHOTO: DESMOND WEE


By Rennie Whang

AS THE luxury residential segment flounders, properties in the Downtown area have taken an especially big hit.
More loss-making transactions have occurred in this area so far this year, compared with last year. Fewer profit-making transactions have taken place.
Resale prices in the area have also fallen faster than those in the traditional prime districts, reflecting its status as a less established high-end residential area.

 
 

According to data compiled by ST Property, there were seven loss-making transactions in the Downtown area in the first eight months of this year.

AS THE luxury residential segment flounders, properties in the Downtown area have taken an especially big hit. More loss-making transactions have occurred in this area so far this year, compared with last year. Fewer profit-making transactions have taken place.
Resale prices in the area have also fallen faster than those in the traditional prime districts, reflecting its status as a less established high-end residential area. According to data compiled by ST Property, there were seven loss-making transactions in the Downtown area in the first eight months of this year.
They ranged from a $60,000 loss from the resale of a 1,130 sq ft unit at Marina Bay Residences last month to a $343,200 loss from the subsale of a 506 sq ft unit at Robinson Suites in April. In comparison, there were just two such transactions in the same period last year – a $30,740 loss from the resale of a 667 sq ft unit at The Sail in January and a $82,400 loss from the resale of a 1,184 sq ft unit, also at The Sail in the same month.
The number of profitable transactions slid from 37 in the first eight months of last year to 27 in the same period this year. The average annualised profit margin from profitable transactions fell as well, from 9.4 per cent a year in the first eight months of last year to 4.83 per cent a year in the same period this year, said SLP International executive director Nicholas Mak.
He added that there was a higher risk of suffering a loss on an investment in a one-bedroom unit this year as five out of seven loss- making deals over the two time periods involved investments in one-bedders (60 sq m, or about 646 sq ft, or smaller). Mr Mak noted that in the first eight months of this year, for 11 out of 34 units sold in District 1, rentals would have been unable to cover the assumed mortgages, assuming median market rents.
This compares with five out of 39 sales over the same period last year. Owners putting up high-end residential units for resale may also be feeling the strain of competing with developers with ample unsold stock, said R’ST Research director Ong Kah Seng. Developers may be offering attractive discounts, or even renting out units instead of selling them.
“This impacts owners who are investors, so their best choice would be to sell the unit away at a loss,” he said. Resale prices in the Downtown area have fallen by about 8 per cent over the past year, whereas resale prices in Districts 9 to 11 fell about 5 per cent over the same period, Mr Ong noted.
Prices are steadier in Districts 9 to 11 as they are more established as exclusive areas, said Mr Ong. “Owners (in these areas) are more willing to hold on to the properties even as prices decline ‘on paper’ – they take pride in their property’s established location.” He noted that units in traditional prime districts are also usually larger, a reflection of the fact that their owners are typically wealthier.
All 330 units in Ardmore Park, for example, are 2,885 sq ft. In comparison, condominiums in the Central Business District usually comprise a mix of small, average and large units. “When the overall high-end residential segment plunges, those newer high-end residential localities without an entrenched positioning might see prices falling faster,” said Mr Ong.

Prices are steadier in Districts 9 to 11 as they are more established as exclusive areas, said Mr Ong. “Owners (in these areas) are more willing to hold on to the properties even as prices decline ‘on paper’ – they take pride in their property’s established location.” He noted that units in traditional prime districts are also usually larger, a reflection of the fact that their owners are typically wealthier.
All 330 units in Ardmore Park, for example, are 2,885 sq ft. In comparison, condominiums in the Central Business District usually comprise a mix of small, average and large units. “When the overall high-end residential segment plunges, those newer high-end residential localities without an entrenched positioning might see prices falling faster,” said Mr Ong.

Reveals a NUS indexThe overall SRPI value is 151.8.
 
The resale prices of private non-landed residential properties remained flat in August, the National University of Singapore’s Singapore Residential Price Index revealed today.
 
The SRPI Index was also flat in July. Resale prices of private condominiums in the Central District were unchanged at 139.5, while the SRPI index in non-central regions inched up by a very marginal 0.1% to 164.2.
 
Currently, SRPI indexes are published in the form of value-weighted indexes. The SRPI is the index for the overall non-landed residential market in Singapore based on the whole SRPI property basket. Two sub-indexes are also produced for the Central and non-Central regions.
 
The Central region sub-basket comprises properties within the overall SRPI basket located in Postal Districts 1 through 4 and 9 through 11 while properties in the other postal districts are in the non-Central region sub-basket.

PRICES of private residential properties slipped for the fourth straight quarter, flash estimates from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed.
 
The overall Private Residential Property Price index, covering both landed and non-landed homes, fell 0.6 per cent in the third quarter, after slipping one per cent in the preceding quarter.
 
Prices of landed properties fell 1.7 per cent, after falling by the same magnitude in the previous quarter.
 
Prices of non-landed condos also fell across all segments. The Core Central Region saw prices slipping 0.9 per cent, after a 1.5 per cent decline in the second quarter, while the Rest of Central Region saw prices dipping 0.1 per cent, compared to the 0.4 per cent decline in the previous quarter.
Prices in the Outside Central Region dipped 0.2 per cent, compared to a 0.9 per cent fall in the previous quarter.
 
The URA said that the flash estimates are compiled based on transaction prices given in caveats lodged during the first 10 weeks of the quarter, supplemented by survey data on new units sold by developers in the quarter.
The data will be updated four weeks later when the URA releases the full real estate statistics for the third quarter, which captures more data on the caveats lodged and the take-up of new projects.

Iskandar 'housing glut' may hit rents
 

 
A LOOMING housing glut in Iskandar Malaysia may weigh down rental yields in the economic zone, with homes being left empty.The warning this time came from Malaysia's national organisation of developers, the Real Estate & Housing Developers Association (Rehda).F.D. Iskandar, president of Rehda, noted that some 30,000 homes could be completed by 2016 or early 2017 in Iskandar.If these are mainly sold to buyers outside Malaysia and Singapore, "then you will see that these units will be empty and once they are put up for rent and there are so many units available, that will put pressure on rental yields", he said.Malaysia's federal government is "actually looking seriously" at this issue, Mr Iskandar added. But land administration in Malaysia lies within the state government's authority.In the past 12 to 18 months, the deluge of homes launched or in the pipeline by Chinese developers, including Country Gardens and Guangzhou R&F Properties, has stoked concerns over a looming housing glut in the Iskandar region, which encompasses an area of more than 2,000 sq km in Johor."Obviously, we have seen developers from China launching a few thousand units at one go," Mr Iskandar said, adding that Malaysian or Singaporean developers would typically have 400 to 600 units in one project.Most of the buyers of these Chinese projects come from mainland China, he observed. "Upon completion, they will not use this as their main home, there will be some concerns about these residential units being empty."But Iskandar is bigger than Nusajaya or Danga Bay, he said, adding that demand for landed homes still "looks very strong".Mr Iskandar noted that many Singaporean buyers prefer to buy from Singapore developers or reputable Malaysian developers.There has also been much interest from Singaporean investors in industrial as well as commercial properties.Meanwhile, other hot property spots in Malaysia such as Penang and Greater Kuala Lumpur are likely to be shielded from the supply glut in Iskandar as strong population growth in these areas is still supporting fundamental demand for housing, according to Mr Iskandar.Kuala Lumpur's population is six million, and could grow to 10 million by 2020 through demographic growth, urbanisation and intra-state migration.Mr Iskandar estimated that this would translate to some 170,000 homes being built each year, based on the assumption of four people per household.Investment yields from residential properties in Penang and Kuala Lumpur are likely to hold up in the region of 5 to 8 per cent, while commercial properties could reap higher yields, he projected.The retail segment has also emerged as a strong component, with Kuala Lumpur being ranked by global news network CNN as the fourth-best city in the world for shopping, after New York, London and Tokyo.With the upcoming high-speed rail between Singapore and Malaysia expected to cut travelling time from 51/2 hours to just 90 minutes, both Kuala Lumpur and Singapore will benefit from greater inter-city travel and cross-border investments, Mr Iskandar said.Still, he is not asking potential buyers to completely snub Iskandar, which he believes to be a "highly investible location".But he has a piece of advice: "Please look at the quality of the developers. Be savvy investors. If it's for owner-occupation, there's no worry whatsoever, but if it is for investment, you need to do due diligence before buying."THE BUSINESS TIMES

now that the oversupply is becoming reality, the last straw is SIBOR rising 1-2% to push sellers off the edge.
 
For a long time already ive given up timing the market, instead i study the market & come up with a conclusiion, then wait for it to hopefully appear. nobody knows when rates will jump, maybe this yr end but most likely next onwards for a couple of yrs... which likely mean the best prices for buyers are over the next 12-24mths... when some if not all the cooling measures have been removed.

Not yet Wait for 2015 for interest rates to rise. From 0.25% to:0.5% will cause another 5% drop0.75% will cause another 2% drop1% will cause another 3% dropSee... total drop only 10% if interest rises to 1% next year. But that's on top of the govt's measure which is already biting. So assuming 8% from the CMs, plus another 10% will be 18% drop next year If interest rates increases another 1% in 2016 we will only see an exponential plunge. Perhaps another 30% drop in 2016.Wah! Property really bearish now...
 
Also, just to add that govt is unlikely to lift any of the CM till the first interest rate increase, lest that they shoot themselves in their own foot. If they lift CM now, more ppl will chiong to buy and when interest rate start to increase they GG during election liao.

http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/housing/story/hdb-resale-prices-fell-eighth-consecutive-month-september-volume-picked
 

SINGAPORE - Although Housing Board resale prices continued an eight-month fall in September, more flats were changing hands, according to SRX Property preliminary figures released on Thursday morning.
HDB resale prices dipped 0.5 per cent in September compared to August, marking a 20-month low. The price index was 7.5 per cent lower than a year ago and 8.9 per cent down from its last peak in April 2013.
The fall was driven by dips of 0.2 per cent for three- and four-room flats, and 1.6 per cent for five-room flats. Executive flat prices rose slightly by 0.1 per cent.
But resale volume improved with 1,469 flats sold in September, up 10.7 per cent from the 1,327 sold in August. This was also 19.9 per cent higher than a year ago.
The rental market remained weak. An estimated 1,483 HDB flats were rented in September, down 6.7 per cent from August and 0.7 per cent from a year ago.
Rental prices also slipped 0.3 per cent from September compared to August, ending up 2.5 per cent lower than a year ago.
Rents were down 0.5 per cent for three-room flats, 0.3 per cent for five-room flats and 0.8 per cent for executive units, but edged up 0.1 per cent for four-room flats.
HDB buyers are continuing to pay less than SRX's estimated market value for their flats, but to a lesser degree. In September, buyers paid a median of $2,000 below SRX's 'X-Value' measure of a flat's market value. This was a price improvement from August, when they were paying $3,000 less than X-Value.- See more at: http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/housing/story/hdb-resale-prices-fell-eighth-consecutive-month-september-volume-picked#sthash.vdpxTMdF.dpuf

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-09/singapore-condo-builders-brace-as-19-billion-due-asean-credit.html
 


 
Singapore’s listed developers and real-estate investment trusts face their heaviest burden of near-term maturities on record just as home prices drop.
The 80 property companies on Singapore’s stock exchange reported a combined S$23.5 billion ($18.5 billion) of borrowings that have to be repaid within a year in their latest filings,Bloomberg-compiled data show. The looming debt wall comes as the vacancy rate for condominiums soared to the highest since 2006, pushing prices to the lowest in almost two years, according to data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority.
Savills Plc predicts refinancing for homebuilders and REITs will be more challenging as Singapore’s economy slows, with expansion cooling to 2.4 percent in the second quarter, from 4.8 percent in the previous three months. Population growth on the island is at a 10-year low and Standard & Poor’s expects home prices have further to fall.
“We’re at that point in the cycle when every quarter you’re seeing selling prices come down a little bit and secondary market transactions aren’t very active,” Kah Ling Chan, a property analyst at S&P in Singapore said. “I suspect we haven’t seen the bottom yet.”
Price Plunge
Developers of residential homes are suffering not so much from lower selling prices than “collapsed” sales volumes, said Alan Cheong, a senior director of real-estate research at Savills in Singapore. Secondary home sales plunged to the lowest since 2003 in the first quarter, according to URA data, and as business slows, builders with less pre-sales money to finish projects have to rely on loans, boosting short-term borrowings, he said by phone Oct. 2.
Despite the weaker demand, the number of new residential dwellings being built remains high. Units under construction reached a record in the second quarter of 2013 and some 65,270 apartments were in the pipeline as of June 30, URA data show.
“Appetite to buy is already curbed” and rents could fall further, Chan said. “We haven’t seen the full impact yet.”
The 42 listed developers on Singapore’s exchange reported S$13.4 billion of short-term borrowings in their latest filings, 42.5 percent more than a year earlier, data compiled by Bloomberg show. City Developments Ltd. (CIT) posted debt of S$1.66 billion in the second quarter, 48.6 percent more than at the end of 2013. Second-quarter net income fell 33 percent, it said in August, and the company is looking to expand overseas to offset declining demand in Singapore.
Borrowing Costs
City Developments’ S$500 million of bonds due next September and sold to investors at par in August 2010 are trading at 101.2 percent of face value, down from 101.25 at the end of last year, DBS Bank Ltd. prices show. It sold S$100 million of 10-year 3.78 percent notes yesterday.
A spokeswoman for City Developments said the company has a strong financial position, noting its cash of S$3.4 billion and 33 percent net gearing ratio.
The three-month swap offer rate, a measure of borrowing costs in Singapore, touched 0.2561 percent on Sept. 16, the highest since June 2013.
REITs are in better shape than listed developers because they started refinancing with longer tenor debt ahead of rising interest rates, according to S&P. “For the REITs, I don’t see a major problem yet,” Chan said. “The bigger players are still getting good rates and valuations haven’t fallen dramatically,” she said.
Ringing Tills
Starhill Global REIT, which has S$124 million of notes that mature in July, reported S$129.1 million of short-term borrowings as of June 30, more than double the amount it had in December 2013. Retail occupancy rates at the trust’s flagship Wisma Atria mall along Singapore’s Orchard Road slipped to 98.5 percent in June from 99.5 percent at the end of 2012, company data show. Office occupancy rates are 100 percent.
Jonathan Kuah, a Singapore-based spokesman for Starhill, said the company has already refinanced its debt due within the coming 12 months. The “leverage situation hasn’t worsened,” he said by e-mail Oct. 7.
Retail sales, which affect revenue at some REITs, decreased for four of the past five months, the worst performance in two years, data from Singapore’s Department of Statistics show. Excluding motor vehicles, sales dropped 0.4 percent in July versus the previous corresponding period.
Don’t Shop Here
“Singaporeans don’t shop here anymore,” Savills’ Cheong said. “Traveling has become so cheap and they buy more stuff on the Internet. The Chinese have also been avoiding Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand since the MH370 tragedy,” he said, referring to the Malaysia Airlines flight missing since March.
Arrivals of tourists from North Asia, which typically comprise more than a quarter of visitors, slumped almost 13 percent the first seven months of 2014 from a year earlier, Tourism Board data show.
“In 2008, when the refinancing situation was quite bad, the REITs still managed to pull through,” said Danny Tan, a Singapore-based fund manager at Eastspring Investments Ltd., which managed $115 billion of assets as of June 30. “There’s a high probability these REITs will be able to refinance especially because the loan market is also open to them.”
While the Singapore dollar has weakened 1.8 percent against the U.S. dollar this half that’s not as much as the Philippine peso, which is down 2.2 percent and Indonesia’s rupiah, down 2.6 percent.
Hiap Hoe Ltd. (HIAP), which recently started selling apartments in its prestigious Skyline 360 building, reported short-term borrowings of S$287.6 million for the quarter to June 30, 94 percent more than the S$147.9 million for the three months to December. It raised S$115 million selling three-year 4.75 percent notes at par in September 2013, which now trade at 100.317. A spokesman for Hiap Hoe declined to comment.
Developers on the island are changing their business models and reducing exposure to the local market, according to Singapore-based Tim Gibson, who helps run Henderson Global Investors Ltd.’s global property equities fund.
“By buying Singapore developers now you’re really buying exposure outside of Singapore and into markets like China,” he said in an interview Oct. 8. It “doesn’t give you a huge amount of confidence that a turnaround in the residential market is coming anytime soon,” he added.

What i have done is put a serious of events that will occur, from there you can see what will happen next
 
First was gold to collapse, followed by reits and then the SGD
 
My prediction still stands that the singapore property prices will collapse by 80% - 90% of its value
 
This in turn would collapse the national currency as well, probably you can expect an exchange rate of 1 USD = S$ 3.50 - S$4
in the future (which is not far off)"

No. of units sold is quite a poor representation of anything actually.
 
Nowadays so many mickey mouse developments, whats the big deal if more units get sold?
Yet less units are being sold YoY....
I can only see prices continue to move southbound.
 
Ie.  Rolex suddenly introduces $2k entry level model, of couse it will sell more pieces.  And if yet it still sells less?  *shake head* that means it has screwed up.
 
The property market has screwed up. 
We just need to watch it unscrew itself taking some people along thats all.

I recently put one of my properties for sale, and I was surprised my asking price was met, that said it was priced realistically as opposed to my neighbors who were asking for a 15% premium.
 
But that was really heart pain to sign the option document   (it was my first property), I am still wondering if I made the right move. I was hoping to hold it until the downtown line MRT station was completed (350 metres away) before selling but all the recent articles about oversupplying glut is really spooking me.

To be honest I don't really know yet, I have other properties and associated debt so if the sh*t hits the fan I will use the cash to pay it out.
 
Alternatively I am looking at some areas now which I believe will appreciate more once the MRT lines I built I might acquire 1 / 2 units in those areas if the pricing is right.
 
I am not good in stocks so I will probably park the funds in FD and the a reasonable sum in the STI ETF.

Exactly, this is what people did not plan properly in investment.
Some reasons make sense, but some are just lacking in proper planning and only itchy hand/gut feeling kinda thing.
 
Unless you have good use for the cash its good, but some people bought other property at equally high price, or put in stock which they don't know about and lost money, or some bought other properties and got unnecessary ABSD/higher loan interest than previous sold property.
 
If it's a good investment that you can hold, why sell? Timing the market only looks good on hindsight, but in actuality more people got burned than making profit by timing the market.

that aint the solution. one downtown area is not enough
 
what the govt should do is to create another 20 downtown area - bukit batok, woodlands, yishun, AMK, Punggol, bedok, tampines etc etc
 
This will make every square foot of SG into prime city center space
 
all singaporeans will then become multi millionaires!

Wait what?
https://sg.news.yahoo.com/only-20-units-sold-marina-one-residences-first-050046873--sector.html
 

Poor sales were recorded on the first day of launch for Marina One Residences with only 20 units sold last Saturday, according to media reports.
This is a sharp turnaround from the strong build-up seen during the preview phase, which saw more than 300 units taken up since 3 October, many by bulk buyers.
Singaporeans account for about 70 percent of buyers, while the rest are PRs and foreign nationalities. The top three groups of overseas buyers are from Malaysia at 20 percent, followed by Indonesia and China.
Approximately 70 percent of the units at Marina One Residences are one- and two-bedrooms. Prices start from around $1.4 million for a one-bedder while two-bedders cost above $2 million.
When contacted, a spokesperson for the developer M+S told PropertyGuru there were no further sales updates at this time.
M+S appears to have adopted a cautious approach to selling units at the development. Just one of its two towers is available for sale right now and only 372 of the total 1,042 apartments have initially been released.
Located in the heart of Singapores new downtown core, the 99-year leasehold condominium is close to Marina Bay MRT station.
Meanwhile, sales of luxury apartments in Singapores central business district have been muted in recent times.
A CBRE report attributed the drop in sales to the TDSR framework which took effect at the end of June 2013.
At the same time, foreign buyers who used to be big players in Singapores prime residential market, appear to be retreating since the ABSD was raised to 15 percent.
 
 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
By BUSINESS TIMESTHE Marina One investment by Khazanah Nasional Bhd and Temasek Holdings is off to a good start, ahead of its public launch on Saturday.Its units, which are priced from RM1.4 million onwards, have been oversubscribed by 20 times.The integrated development near the Marina Bay financial district, here, is flanked by two parks — the Marina Station Square and Central Linear Park.It is expected to be completed in 2017.M+S Pte Ltd chief operating officer Kemmy Tan said private viewings had been held for two weeks and the project was well-received, judging from the healthy interest by local and foreign buyers.“Our strongest foreign buyer markets are from Malaysia, China, India and Indonesia, with 70 per cent of them looking to invest and the rest for own occupation.“We expect more buyers to come forward when the public launch begins on October 11 in both countries.“Interested buyers in Malaysia may visit our sales gallery in Plaza Mont Kiara, which is already open,” said Tan at the Marina One special preview on Thursday.The residential units come in four designs; namely 1-bedroom, 2-bedroom, 3-bedroom and 4-bedroom, and all units come equipped with a private lift.He said among the challenges faced during the initial development phase were the design considerations as well as huge amount of coordination that took place.“The successful collaboration between the two countries was especially evident when both prime ministers unveiled Marina One last year during the Annual Leaders Retreat, aas well as the timely progress of the development.”Marina One is a mixed-use development bounded by Marina Way and Straits View in Marina South.

Buffett rolls out the Berkshire Hathaway brandStephen Foley20 Hours AgoFinancial Times

 


Warren Buffett plans to license the Berkshire Hathaway name to estate agencies in Europe and Asia, in the next phase of a campaign to use his widely respected investment company as a consumer brand.


Adam Jeffery | CNBC
Warren Buffett


After decades buying into some of the most valuable brands in the world, Berkshire has this year dramatically expanded the use of its own name, rebadging its family of utility companies, U.S. estate agents and a newly acquired car dealership.
Marketing consultants and company insiders believe it is sitting on a valuable asset in the Berkshire Hathaway brand, which they say taps into 84-year-old Mr Buffett's reputation for financial acumen and longevity.
"Like Virgin reflects Sir Richard Branson's rebelliousness and Apple reflects the genius of Steve Jobs, Berkshire Hathaway has brand equity around trust, stability and integrity," said Oscar Yuan, partner at consultancy Millward Brown Vermeer.
The number of U.S. estate agencies using the Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices brand will swell to almost 1,400 by next spring, said Earl Lee, chief executive of HSF Affiliates, a franchising joint venture between Berkshire and Brookfield Asset Management.

Seven in 10 new private condos sold in H1 at under S$1.25 mBy Kalpana Rashiwalakalpana@sph.com.sg@KalpanaBT15 OctA STUDY by CBRE has showed that 71.7 per cent of new sales of private apartments and condos in the first half of this year had price tags of below S$1.25 million each. This is higher than the 63.6 per cent share recorded for the whole of last year.The property consultancy group observed that even with a longer-range view - looking at figures since 2007, despite rising wages and inflation - this sweet spot of consumers has stayed largely unchanged.CBRE research head Desmond Sim said: "Our study of caveats lodged for non-landed new sales from 2007 to H1 2014 showed that 55 to 75 per cent of transactions were priced below S$1.25 million each. In particular, the most popular price band was from S$750,000 to S$1 million over this period."AdvertisementLooking at the addresses of buyers of new sale units with price tags below S$1.25 million, CBRE noted that, since 2008, 52 to 67 per cent of them have been HDB occupiers."They could be HDB upgraders, or singles and new couples looking for their first homes. The TDSR (total debt servicing ratio) framework has just closed the lid tighter on liquidity and made it that much harder for HDB upgraders to buy a private property, much less new couples aspiring to join the fray by bypassing the HDB route," Mr Sim said.Although the proportion of HDB dwellers among buyers of new non-landed private homes below S$1.25 million was at a high of 66.7 per cent in H1 2014, the absolute number of such buyers was only 1,696 in the first six months of this year; this is lower than the 1,967 figure for H2 2013 and 3,385 for H1 2013.The number of units below S$1.25 million picked up by those with private addresses also fell markedly to 847 in H1 2014, from 1,459 in H2 2013 and 2,248 in H1 2013.This reflects the across-the-board drop in property transaction volumes following the introduction of the TDSR framework in late June 2013.DTZ SEA chief operating officer Ong Choon Fah said that a large portion of HDB dwellers buying private homes are likely doing so for owner occupation.She acknowledged that some of these upgraders would be moving into smaller private housing units. "They may be downsizing, but psychologically, they feel they have arrived because they have upgraded to join the 20 per cent of households here living in private homes."Moving to a private condo allows you to pamper yourself with club-style facilities just a door-step away. This is especially appealing to those with kids."She pointed out that the design of condo projects has changed to include a higher proportion of small units. "Developers now offer more amenities and spaces for entertaining - not just at the clubhouse and poolside but sky gardens for instance - to cater to residents in small units who wish to entertain guests outside their units."

it is just sad that for many singaporeans, they feel the need to keep up with the jones, and to give the impression that they are doing very well

however i think it is unlikely that results alone would get someone sacked in this type of company
 
i suppose things changed a fair bit since the liew mun leong left

Asia - playground for fun managers  
 
 
 
 Asia’s unresolved $10bnCBRE’s white paper on Asian fund terminations published this week highlights how there is insufficient capital in the region to absorb the amount of real estate to be sold.
 
CBRE’s The Great Wave of Fund Expiration white paper published on Monday reveals approximately $40 billion of real estate in Asia is to become available for sale in the next two years.
 
The 15-page paper takes the temperature of the region’s private real estate funds market, which the firm reckons is really only one ‘great wave’ of funds old. Funds were formed for real estate investments in Asia previously, but as CBRE sees it, the 84 funds raised between 2005 and 2008 account for a bulk of the equity raised for the region so far.
 
It says 50 of these funds, responsible for the aforementioned $40 billion of assets, are slated for termination in 2014 and 2015. When you consider also how capital markets support is once again returning to the sector, it is becoming increasingly likely that we are in the midst of the second wave of funds dedicated to the region.
This second wave won’t be quite as ‘great’ as the first wave though. Using historical data to predict future investing patterns, CBRE forecasts the market will only likely absorb about $30 billion of these particular assets. Funds will constitute part of that buying power but there will be other kinds of buyers besides.
 
CBRE also infers that the second wave will herald lower risk and return strategies than many of the opportunistic strategies that dominated the first wave. No doubt, the pool of assets that already has been managed through one cycle of funds and thus has seen its risk reduced will play some part in the strategy of the incoming funds.
 
When PERE spoke with CBRE following the publishing of the paper, the firm said most of the prime and liquid assets held by the first wave of funds have been sold already. The remaining ones generally require further asset management, but would hardly fall into either distressed or development categories – the two most recognizable hallmarks of an opportunistic strategy. Better it finds homes with core-plus and value-added strategies.
 
From this you might infer that the next generation of opportunity funds will be best off tackling the unresolved $10 billion.
 
In the paper, CBRE details four options for managers finding themselves with assets that sit outside of what the market can naturally absorb. They are: extend, restructure, secondaries or IPO. Which route they take depends really on prevailing market conditions. CBRE notes that 65 percent of the assets are in Australia, Japan and China. There currently is stronger demand for property in the first two of these markets than in the third, and that will naturally inform which of these routes they take.
 
Whatever transpires, the unresolved first-wave fund assets in each of these markets likely will be sold at some interesting discounts – and that is precisely what opportunistic capital is all about. Meanwhile, the lion’s share of the legacy investments - the naturally resolvable properties if you will – are destined for the region’s now lower-risk and return investors.

east side is now pending airport development. Once the height restriction is remove, ppl will start moving back to east side.
 
No matter how "beautiful" jurong is .. you wont get over the occasional chocolate smell and buring incenarator.Now even bird park , they are moving to mandai. In any case, $30 per airport transfer will also drive freq traveller to the east side.. :)

Physical property market is much slower than most other financial markets so must make sure we shore up reserves and be steady ready.  
 
The signs which were building up since 2013 are so clear and in our faces, only the stupid will think that the market can be going any other way but down.
Price stays the same or is marked up by up to 180k? Whether price stay the same or not....
if sales are good, need to resort to such gimmicks or not?

So are they charging buyers for Lim Ming Yan's management time to come up with this innovative ID plus product?  I will be surprised it helps to move significant number of units, knn, just do what Capitaland did for Bishan, cut price to move units lah or is Mr. Lim changing their strategies?

So are they charging buyers for Lim Ming Yan's management time to come up with this innovative ID plus product?  I will be surprised it helps to move significant number of units, knn, just do what Capitaland did for Bishan, cut price to move units lah or is Mr. Lim changing their strategies?
Interlace is also by CapLand...

I know bro.... that is why I am puzzled. They cut price for D Leedon and Bishan projects but this one is a different ID driven strategy.  They got the land cheap, so got rooms to cut price, IIRC.

 		Private home prices at a new equilibrium 
Private property market prices in Singapore may be levelling off at a new support level after five years of cooling measures that have been very effective at stalling the market.
BY SAM BAKER -
OCTOBER 24

Private property market prices in Singapore may be levelling off at a new support level after five years of cooling measures that have been very effective at stalling the market.
However, it appears the effectiveness of the measures has levelled off. Barring major catastrophes such as war, epidemics or financial crises, private property prices are expected to hold up, unless more resale supply is introduced or the Government removes the cooling measures.
According to SRX Property, the market transacted an estimated 468 units last month. This is down 77.2 per cent from the peak of 2,050 units sold in April 2010.
Prices, on the other hand, have dropped a mere 5.6 per cent since the market’s monthly peak in January 2014, based on the SRX Price Index.
There are three signs that it is going to be difficult for the cooling measures to pull prices down further.
The first half of this year was rough for the private resale market, with the SRX Price Index dropping rather dramatically from 178.8 in January to 170.2 in June.
However, since June, the index has found a plateau in the 168 to 170 range. This suggests the market has come to terms with the impact of the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR).
Until the TDSR, private resale prices would not come down. They finally capitulated at the beginning of the year. But now, it seems the market may have found a price equilibrium under the new TDSR regime.
Second, market sentiment, as measured by the median Transaction-Over-X Value (T-O-X) has improved in the past few months. T-O-X measures the actual transaction prices over the computer-generated X-Value of each unit in Singapore.
Last month, the national median T-O-X was negative S$2,000, which means the average buyer was paying only S$2,000 below the computer-generated X-Value. This is a big improvement over the negative S$20,000 in March and July.
In other words, fewer people are paying significantly below the computer-generated X-Value. This means less downward pressure on prices.
Third, volume is down significantly and has been consistently in the mid-400-unit range. There is not much more room for volume and, hence, prices to drop.
The cooling measures, in particular those impacting the TDSR, have been quite effective at discouraging people from putting homes on the market.
While bargain hunters and those unaffected by the cooling measures are delighted to buy today, sellers are not as inclined to sell. They have been sitting on the sidelines, waiting for prices to rebound before putting their properties on the market.
Unless a new round of resale supply comes onto the market or there is an external shock that causes a sell-off, it will be difficult for the market to drop much further, given the low stock of homes for sale each month.

PROPERTY prices in Singapore have not seen a "meaningful correction" yet, said Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam on Tuesday.
"We've seen some correction in both private property pricesand HDB resale prices over the last four to five quarters, but there is some distance to go in achieving a meaningful correction after the sharp run-up in prices in recent years," said the chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore at the Credit Counselling Singapore's 10th anniversary luncheon.
"If we do not get a meaningful reversal after each upswing, property prices will run ahead of the growth in household incomes in the long term. And that, we must avoid."

prices have dropped but in small volume... my contrarian view is the current situation is v similar to 2008 - 2009, where prices did drop but in small volume, therein lies the opportunity for a good buy. ive detected some already n gona view them. in fact sentosa big units r seriously hit, many foreigners offloading but no buyers...

If you hv detected some, then its good.  
There will still be genuine sellers who know that they must discount 10% off current to get a sale done.
Keep a lookout for those.
 
The biggest difference between now and 2009 is that people are already heavy property in their port now.
The buying pressure is much lower than the selling pressure.
 
In 2008/2009 many people were clean as a whistle. 
Like myself i sold off two properties in 2007 and 2008 leaving the roof over my head in 2009.
I hv done the same last year, selling at record high price, now leaving just the roof over my head
But the masses are instead heavy laden with debt today.  
 
We are not tycoons, if dont reload , how to shoot.
Some people wait until completely no bullets then they reload.
By that time everybody is reloading, so got not enough bullets to go around.
 
I hv reloaded, have you?
 
All the best, bro.

The buyer decided not to exercise the option, he wanted to move in after the tenancy expired but wasn't happy that the TA had the a clause for the tenant to extend for 1 year at market rate. My tenant don't want to legally waive that out and I don't wanna force him so it fell thru.
 
Not sure which part of the "buying with tenancy" did he not understand. TMD waste my time, some more there was another interested buyer  around the same time but now run road liao.
 
Next time I have to include in the TA a waiver to the extension option if the property is sold.
 
 
 
Very heng you hit gian png buyer, (i hit one too after waiting 9 mths last yr) , care to share location, site, price , psf, etc?Your neighbors are not serious sellers lah. 15% premium can go jiak sai.Unless it is really sought after property 10% discount off last done more like it.

Buying with tenancy just means you have a tenant (for however number of months the agreement has left) but if you failed to disclose at the start that the agreement has an additional clause for extension then how will the buyer know about it? If you did not disclose the extension clause then I feel that you have been deceitful and wasted the buyers time (disclaimer, if you did disclose it beforehand then it is obviously his fault).
 
By the way, you could have asked the tenant how much $ he wanted from you to give a waiver for that clause.

Firstly its for the agent to explain the terms of the sale not me, I was too was concern that this was not clearly explained but the Option did clearly state it was sold with tenancy and subject to terms of the TA. It was even discussed during the house visit that the tenant may extend. The buyer likely didn't give it too much thought until he got the option and had a discussion with his friends.
 
I bought properties with tenancy before and I always request and review necessary documents mentioned on the option before committing to anything (to the point of making sure the tenancy is stamped). Especially when its legal and requires me to put up cash upfront. I cannot fathom why people legally commit to something without making sure all their concerns are met. 
 
My tenant is very decent chap, he would see offering money as buying him off and would really piss him off. He just didn't want to commit to anything legally since he wasn't obliged too and if he had to then he would need to consult his lawyer. But he also didn't see what the big deal was since it was a mutual agreement to extend pending the revise rental rates once the agreement expires.

Point taken about the TA but I don't understand why your tenant would be offended.
 
A tenancy agreement is a business transaction and so is a cancellation of the clause in it. Nothing much to do with whether he is a decent chap or not. I also don't see why he had to consult his lawyer - do you mean he also had a lawyer go thru the TA when he first signed it?

Haha not sure how to put it but lets say he has a strong moral standing? But he is the best tenant I have, he would sometimes update me on issues around the estate not impacting him but as an fyi that the MA is not doing in the interest of the owners. He also helps resolve issues on the property which most tenants would demand the owner come down and rectify it immediately.
 
The original TA was a standard one that he was familiar with, he is a family guy and he wasn't comfortable to put a legal waiver on any part of the contract would may jeopardize his occupancy. Its just one of those things some people feel uncomfortable with I guess.

As a buyer i will request to go through TA.
Its part of due diligence.
Believing the agent wholeheartedly is the last thing anyone should do - seller or buyer.
 
People usually dont give up option for such small reasons.
Its not like the extension will definitely happen
And if it should happen its in the buyers favor as rents are dropping.
 
I know becos i also gave up exercising an option costing a high grade 1 carat diamond before.
Reason being, i got a better unit at a price cheaper by a high grade 2 carat diamond. Haw haw.
 
So my take is that he either found another unit cheaper or he realised that the price aint right as the market is coming off.  So he give some half baked reason for not exercising.  
 
Bottomline is that the unit remains unsold at the price you wanted.
Good luck.

I also think that the tenancy is too small a matter for the buyer not to exercise. On a positive side, you managed to forfeit the option money. It should be a decent amount for the 2 weeks of agony for you.

I checked other TA I have and it not a clause that typically, I am not defending the agent but I don't think its something normally inserted in the TA. Every agent has a varying TA template and yours is on the ball to have it included. Anyway as above since its a legal doc which I committed too its my fault for not vetting it properly. 
 
That one reason why I posted my experience to, so others can note it down for future refence.
all good tenancy agreement must have escape clause for both landlord and tenant.. In situation of tenants got posted out of SG, and if landlord sell house.. Yours don't have this?? Please blasted your agent who help u rent house.

I do believe he actually wanted to go thru with the deal, cause he arrange to speak to the tenant himself after we failed to convince him to sign the waiver. Guess he was really bothered by this option.
 
My unit would be considered one of the cheapest one in district, and its very relatively to scgs. I would be ideal for someone looking to upgrade with a family I suppose. Anyway just another throw of the dice, I'll see how things pan out.
 
 
As a buyer i will request to go through TA.Its part of due diligence.Believing the agent wholeheartedly is the last thing anyone should do - seller or buyer.People usually dont give up option for such small reasons.Its not like the extension will definitely happenAnd if it should happen its in the buyers favor as rents are dropping.I know becos i also gave up exercising an option costing a high grade 1 carat diamond before.Reason being, i got a better unit at a price cheaper by a high grade 2 carat diamond. Haw haw.So my take is that he either found another unit cheaper or he realised that the price aint right as the market is coming off. So he give some half baked reason for not exercising.Bottomline is that the unit remains unsold at the price you wanted.Good luck.
 
Lol it is indeed, but I will need to compensate my agent/lawyer for time spent assuming we don't successfully sell the property. Its only fair they partake in some of it for their time & efforts.
 
The rest will probably go into my kids childcare fees  
 

 
I also think that the tenancy is too small a matter for the buyer not to exercise. On a positive side, you managed to forfeit the option money. It should be a decent amount for the 2 weeks of agony for you.

For your info, it is usually stated in the OTP that should it be forfeited, agent gets half the amount.

Thanks for the below Throttle, it was not on the OTP but on the sales service agreement. Sua Ku me so focused on the OTP I missed it out, not that I would have raised a fuss anyway since I didn't expect that to happen. Strange the agent hasn't asked for it yet.
 
Aiya I just feel that its right (even if the agent didn't have the 50% clause). Although I was thinking of just giving them 2 / 3 grand and not 50% 
 
I am a ka kia draw humble salary leh, you are the real BOSS

Yeah, probably not applicable to MCF folks becos i understand, most people here in recent years change to full settlement in cash instead of loans.
 
Then again not applicable in the past as well becos people seem very comfortable buying a car which is priced the same quantum as their annual salary.
This inevitably means at least $1,500 for car loans.
 
Hhhmmmmm,  so complicated is Singapore life, aiyah dont buy already lah....muayhaha

another question for gurus: for those who have fully paid for properties, is it possible to get cash out of home equity financing to buy another property? assume this cash out is considered variable, then one can add the cash out to the rental income n then combine both for a larger variable income?

By BUSINESS TIMES
 
THE Marina One investment by Khazanah Nasional Bhd and Temasek Holdings is off to a good start, ahead of its public launch on Saturday.
 
Its units, which are priced from RM1.4 million onwards, have been oversubscribed by 20 times.
 
The integrated development near the Marina Bay financial district, here, is flanked by two parks — the Marina Station Square and Central Linear Park.
 
It is expected to be completed in 2017.
 
M+S Pte Ltd chief operating officer Kemmy Tan said private viewings had been held for two weeks and the project was well-received, judging from the healthy interest by local and foreign buyers.
 
 

 
Starting price is only S$538k? So cheap?
 
All those predicting the imminent collapse since 2009 must be right.

Not allowed. You cannot draw a loan backed by property to pay for another one.
But as usual, if dont get caught, double yellow line can park too, wahahahaha

http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/property-management-news/2014/11/71751/falling-hdb-prices-led-to-higher-ec-vacancy
 
 

 
Falling prices in the HDB resale market has resulted in more vacant Executive Condominiums (ECs), according to Century 21’s Chief Executive Ku Swee Yong in a media report.
 
At the end of September, there were 14,624 completed ECs, of which a total of 2,941 units came from six projects completed in the first three quarters of 2014. However, 16.2 percent or 2,375 units out of the overall figure were vacant, he said.
 
This means 2,941 ECs were added this year, but the number of vacant units significantly increased to 2,375 in Q3 2014.
 
“One reason for the slow take-up of ECs despite the Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) is that upgraders and second-timers are finding it challenging to sell their current HDB flats,” he said.
 
“Four years ago, when these ECs were launched, a typical plan for upgraders was to buy the EC — many on deferred payment schemes — in the expectation that HDB resale prices will rise during the time that the new home was being built.”
 
By the time the ECs were completed, they thought they could gain a sizeable windfall from the sale of their HDB flats, which could be used to pay off a portion of the loan for the EC unit.
“However, the tide has turned against them. HDB resale prices have dropped for the past five quarters and recent changes to valuation rules and to purchases by Permanent Residents have made it even tougher to sell the current units at market prices,” Ku explained.
 
While some HDB sellers, especially upgraders, accepted below-market prices, some are still waiting for better offers. However, there are some who postpone collecting their EC keys as they hold out for better prices.
“So, in the EC segment, potentially about 2,300 families concurrently own two taxpayer-subsidised housing units: the HDB flat that they currently own and possibly occupy, and one completed EC that they have yet to move into,” Ku said.
 
Because each family can only posses one subsidised home under the law, upgraders are compelled to sell their HDB flat as quickly as possible. “The pressure to sell may worsen, with EC completions expected to total 2,854 next year, 6,371 in 2016 and 2,505 in 2017,” he added.

Let me correct that.
The pressure to sell WILL worsen.

EC buyers are from the same pool of HdB buyers
 
Mostly not affected by cooling measures and buyers are upgraders or first time buyers
 
This means people who buy to stay.
 
Invest property market is a different story.  
 
Different segment different results different characteristics.
 
After so many rounds of price reductions, its no surprise that real demand pick up a little.
People buy so that they can move on in life.
 
*yawn*
Blardy hell who say its going downhill lolReal astute investors. Read: ME

all depends on p8p's immigration polices IMO. 20k below current valuation but up 50-100% from long ago values still = net valuation gains lol...

Of course earn because bought direct from hdb.
 
But selling below valuation means unexpectedly the loan on the ec became bigger than originally planned

There's an article in ST yesterday on FH v 99 yrs leasehold, quite an interesting read actually. 
Sorry I can't post the link as I not ST online subscriber but in short they claim if you intend to have better
rental yield, in would be better to invest in 99 yrs leasehold condo in view of the lower price upfront.
 
Obviously if you intend for own stay, then freehold may be better. Never thought of it this way
as I always thought freehold is better!

Yes if for rental dont care about freehold or 99 as long as its near mrt and good location. If 99 there will be better return compared to freehold but then again when u sell ur property 10 years later, freehold will be better

Didn't read the article but did they mention overall returns or just the rental yield?
 
Rental yield for 99yrs will of course be higher but the land+building is subject to depreciation as well. In the case of freehold, only the building is subject to depreciation.
 
One should always consider overall returns instead of just rental yield.

Fully agree with you on overall returns that's why I feel the article abit skewed cos they too focused on returns and they calculate based on the rental vs cost of the condo which obviously the 99 yr one wins. When you eventually sell, the freehold should still fair better IMO. Think their point is for the overall quantum you pay, you get a better return esp in these days of TDSR.

No road works to airport , no direct access everywhere , i don't see how Jurong will facilitate the CBD requirements , though i do understand the need to decentralize.
 
As for the lake simi lake simi , personally i see why i will clusterf**k in jurong where it jams almost every morning and evening and how many FW fills up the malls everyday.
 
I am not having phobias but i do think as compared to wasting plenty of time on traveling and waiting for jams , i would prefer to stay nearer to my work place and spend lesser time on travels. I won't mind pay a little more as i think it addes up when you including waiting time , travel time , fuel and erp cost.
 
Anyway ,i am in view of a correction of the property prices since 2013 and will continue to remain this way at least til the elections.

True to some and not true to others , for my case , i have stayed near town for almost the past 30 over years  , my average travel time be driving(no jam) or taking an mrt to my work place is around 15~20 mins.
 
I have practically worked in town for the past 15 years and i do think , having a shorter traveling time would save me alot of time over the long run to do other stuff.
 
I cite an example , if i stay in jurong and work in town , let's say raffles place , the average traveling time is at least 40 mins and another 40 mins back . 1hour and 20 mins. For my case , i roughly take 15mins~20mins under normal traffic to reach home from where i work let say i over estimate , 25 mins , the difference is at least 30 mins per day.
 
Not alot , but if you include , travel cost , Erp , Jams and petrol , i save at least 10-30 bucks on productivity related cost mutiple by 300 days * 5 = it is a difference of 45k over a period of 5 years , not alot of difference for some but i rather spend my 30 mins doing something else like having coffee with someone than to be stuck traveling.
 
Now a house in jurong 4 rooms 460k and one let's say in tiong bahru/potong pasir cost 600k the difference of 140k is offset by a 45k difference over 5 years not to mention capital appreciation. Of course i don't deny people changing their jobs and locations , different people different requirements.

I'm a simple man. I can't just stomach paying so much money for something that's not freehold. Even if it's 200-300k cheaper. 
But my friend is single (no siblings) and plans to stay single, for him, i agree buying 99LH for your own stay and rental makes sense for him. Cos when he dies, he's just going to donate what's left to charity.

the properties im interested in have dropped more than 10% FYI... also in 2008-2009 crisis, prices dropped max abt 20-25%...
 
property must buy along the dips as in the long run it goes up so this current rental problem is good time to lowball sellers.

Bishan and amk (matured town as well) is really the most central part of SG, although there are not that particular close to CBD. 
 
The traveling to each part of SG from bishan or amk via public transport is really faster especially after inclusion of circle line.

This development should rival Jurong Gateway in the sense that it's a mixed development right smack in the middle of a popular housing estate and with MRT at the door step. I suppose with govt promoting Jurong, that one slightly more expensive. That said I'm not too convinced personally at this price but then again I have a bad track record as far as predicting housing price are concerned haha!

And dont bother looking at the inflated caveated prices. Real trasacted prices are easily 15-20% cheaper after all the developer discounts subsidies and vouchers.

huat ah huah ah!!!! dun spread fear!!!!!!
 

SINGAPORE - Home buyers picked up 765 private condo units last month, as developers rolled out new property launches and discounts at older developments.
This was a 18 per cent jump over September's 648 units, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority showed on Monday.
The estimates came on the heels of a dismal quarter of sales for the three months to Sept 30, during which developers shifted just 1,596 condo units - the lowest quarterly figure since just 419 units were sold in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Rules that restrict the size of a mortgage implemented in June last year have weighed on buying sentiments, causing the market to be a pale shadow of itself just 18 months ago, when quarterly sales averaged about 5,000 units.
Compared to the same month a year ago, October's sales fell 30.7 per cent.
Buying in the city centre areas underpinned October's performance, with half the units sold in the central region.
Projects in the suburbs moved 261 units - or 34 per cent - of all homes sold, while developers sold 123 units - the remaining 16 per cent - in the city-fringe areas.
The top seller was the massive integrated development in the Marina Bay precinct, Marina One Residences, where 334 of its 1,042 units were snapped up at a median price of $2,228 per sq ft (psf), after its developer M+S announced that early buyers would be given a 10 per cent discount, bringing prices down to between $1,960 and $3,100 per sq ft (psf).
Older projects that were launched earlier this year drew buyers as well. City Development's Coco Palms in Pasir Ris came in second with 34 units that were sold at a median price of $1,039 psf, bringing the total sales tally at the 944-unit condo to 725 units.
At Lakeville, a project in the Lakeside area, its developer MCL Land sold 32 units at a median price of $1,340 psf. So far, 321 of its 696 units have been sold.
Including executive condos, which are a hybrid of public and private housing, 855 units were sold last month - a 21 per cent rise from September's figure.- See more at: http://www.straitstimes.com/news/business/property/story/new-condo-sales-jump-18-oct-driven-buying-city-centre-ura-20141117#sthash.80zZGiHw.dpuf

Long way to go, as mentioned there will always to real demand and at lowered prices, these will come in.
But the supply is way way beyond actual demand, without investment appetite to jiak, the buffet spread will confirmed be leftover to rot...

More high-end homeowners default payments
 
The number of houses placed on the auction block by banks has increased by nearly five-fold as borrowers struggle to sell their luxury units amid the falling prices and the governments tough cooling measures, according to media reports. 
Between January and October of this year, 98 repossessed homes were placed under the auctioneers gavel, said Colliers International, a far cry from the 17 for the whole of 2013.

It is probable that the cost of extracting shale will fall over the years, so falling oil prices may not help to show down shale production in the long run given the ever improving technology.

USA doing his best to hurt Russia economy. Lower oil price will improve GDP for them. Keep inflation in check, therefore no need to raise interest rate so early.

The worse loss i have taken was about $130k during the crisis. But i made it all back plus more.
I am quite conservative, so losses are never very huge.  Profits also slow and steady.
 
Thats my boring life

Property also sold at the peak and holding cash.
Like you say, tempting....

haha go other places to buy if you hold cash , different nations have different stages of their life cycle.
 
Malaysia is also on the rise for its city area while iskandar is dead piece of land , law isn't to our favor , i won't take a chance on those.
 
Based on credit , japan is at rock bottom and US is on it rise though. There isn't any chance for japan to recover unless there is a sudden rise in pop growth or huge drop in the older generation,anyone studying economics would be able to tell you that japan had a fantastic growth partially because of US technology transfer and a high growth in pop in people willing to take hardship.
 
In Singapore it is the same unless we do something to improve our population on people willing to work , we are heading for the same path. What we are experiencing is a high growth in the malay population and this might affect the fabric of our nation. Just look at our neighbors, look at how hard working their malays are?
 
Many can't study though most are good natured people, i am not racist , i have seen how hard our teachers tried, the environment for them is simply too hard for them to pick up the speed of study when other kids are already too ahead from the countless tuition lessons the parents put the kids to. One e.g my nephew goes for 4 extra lessons on top of normal school , his entire saturday is tuition and piano classes while sundays swimming and other activities.
 
How do malay kids catch up when most don't even go for kindergarten despite so much subsidies given to the malay kids and many go into primary schools without learning how to count to 20. How to compare to those kids which are already doing division and problem sums?
 
I am pretty negative in the way our garmen treats this problem. They aren't addressing problems of these fast growing populations which can be useful to society if properly educated and importing low classes trash from china and india would not help much .
 
They should also address to the high cost of living and having a family for the young as a whole. Regardless whether how strawberry one is , the basic cost of getting a home and surviving is damn high, as mentioned in the other chat , it is time for property prices to drop sharply and allow Singaporeans to grow our nest again and call this places our home.
 
Not let FTrash and FW lay waste to our land ,ruin its fabric  and walk away with the hard earned money we worked so hard collectively for. We need foriegn investments but not trash .

People should be more cautious when they buy properties, make sure they have remaining cash to buffer any loss. Don't push your limit to get a property. If u cant get a favorite and popular condo, then go slightly further for cheaper one that is friendly to your pocket.
 
 
For example i could get a D9 condo but i ended up in D15 condo with installment only 1.4k per month

Only idiots believe that the real transacted price from developers is anywhere near the reported caveated price.
 
Most of the time it is 10-20% lower.

Ok, now that all paperwork done, have to admit the place my gf and i just bought (for own stay) is also the lowest PSF in the development (i reckon approx 15-18% off the average psf). I think we might be the ones pulling the mkt down in the area.
 
but i'm happy cos it's the culmination of our years of "savings-to-buy-our-very-own-place" plan :) as for it going on URA website. *wink wink*

looking forward for 30% down from current pricing ... huat ah!
will mock buy 1 more unit when price down 30%? 
 
This new equilibrium in resale volume, coupled with the price plateau, suggests that the TDSR might have run out of steam in terms of its effectiveness in reducing prices further. 
Therefore, for prices to continue to decline, something must be introduced into the equation to alter the market’s dynamics. So, the first question is whether the Government is satisfied with a 5 per cent decline.
 
If not, what additional policy tools are available to the authorities?
Given that the cooling measures have proven that price is a stubborn variable in the property market, if it wants the price to drop further in the private non-landed resale market, the only way is to increase supply.
 
Demand, at its current level, is about as far down as cooling measures can push it.

S'pore posts biggest drop in house prices in the region 
https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/spore-posts-biggest-drop-house-prices-region-025349644--sector.html
 

 
House prices in Singapore fell 4.3 percent year-on-year in the third quarter, making it the largest drop across several Asia Pacific markets, according to JLL and reported in the media.
 
The drop in prices came as extra stamp duties and tighter bank lending rules continue to weigh on market sentiments.
JLL expects house prices in Singapore to continue to correct over the next quarters, with a decline of -2 percent to -6 percent in the quarters leading up to end-2015.
 
In other markets, Manila registered the largest year-on-year increase in house prices at 12.7 percent, while Shanghai came in second with an 8.9 percent increase in prices.
 
Modest price growth is expected in Beijing and Shanghai as sales volumes may improve in the next 12 months after the loosening of mortgage lending policy, said the report.
 
In emerging SEA, most markets should see moderate price growth supported by persisting buyer interest. However, capital value growth in Kuala Lumpur is likely to be driven by the introduction of higher priced units.

10% cut from previous asking price does not mean developer is selling cheap if the "previous" asking price was "insane" (140% markup)
it's like $20k overtrade for $200k car given by AD ... $20k overtrade is GIVEN

S'pore posts biggest drop in house prices in the region
 
https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/spore-posts-biggest-drop-house-prices-region-025349644--sector.html
 
Asia-House-prices-Q3-JLL.png
 
House prices in Singapore fell 4.3 percent year-on-year in the third quarter, making it the largest drop across several Asia Pacific markets, according to JLL and reported in the media.
 
The drop in prices came as extra stamp duties and tighter bank lending rules continue to weigh on market sentiments.
JLL expects house prices in Singapore to continue to correct over the next quarters, with a decline of -2 percent to -6 percent in the quarters leading up to end-2015.
 
In other markets, Manila registered the largest year-on-year increase in house prices at 12.7 percent, while Shanghai came in second with an 8.9 percent increase in prices.
 
Modest price growth is expected in Beijing and Shanghai as sales volumes may improve in the next 12 months after the loosening of mortgage lending policy, said the report.
 
In emerging SEA, most markets should see moderate price growth supported by persisting buyer interest. However, capital value growth in Kuala Lumpur is likely to be driven by the introduction of higher priced units.
 

 
Wah
 
drop 4..3 % is the biggest loser in APAC?
 
Market damn jialat sia

oh.. so based on your example like that, means the 10% cut considered market is dropping or not?

Southeast Asia: Singapore tests its successJeremy GrantWeary commuters stream off the train at the station in Punggol, a district on Singapore's east coast, as retired engineer Michael Ng and his wife hunt down a restaurant in the area known for its seafood.Like many parts of the Asian city-state, Punggol has been transformed by the economic miracle that propelled Singapore from what was a southeast Asian backwater after independence from Britain in 1965 into one of the world's most successful economies.The last pig farm in Punggol closed in 1990 as the area's kampongs – a Malay word for village – gave way to dense developments of government housing, home for thousands of Singapore citizens and, increasingly, migrant workers from China that make up a large proportion of the island's 1.3 million population of foreigners. The total population is 5.3 million – about the same as Norway.But Mr Ng, 67, says life has become "more stressful" of late. "My children have to work very long hours. People have to work hard to maintain their lifestyles, transport costs have already increased these past two years and housing has gone up a lot," he says.The Singapore in which Mr Ng's children are working is a radically different place from the post-colonial years, when per capita gross domestic product was a mere $550. Thanks to an astonishing feat of nation-building under the iron leadership of Lee Kuan Yew, one of the 20th century's most respected Asian statesmen, Singapore boasts GDP per capita of $55,000, according to the World Bank. That puts Singapore ahead of $47,000 for Ireland, with a comparable permanent population.And for a tiny city-state whose land mass is about the same as a moderately sized Caribbean island, Singapore has for decades punched above its weight.Its economy has grown at an average of 5-7 per cent for much of the past decade, helping to create a gleaming financial hub that is closing the gap with Switzerland as the world's largest for wealth management. Singapore is Asia's largest trading center for both foreign exchange and commodities.Low corporate taxes – averaging 17 percent – have lured foreign investment, turning it into the undisputed business node for the fast-growing economies of southeast Asia. The ships moored in a narrow channel separating Singapore from Indonesia – visible from the top floors of the offices of Citibank and Standard Chartered – are evidence of Singapore's role as the world's largest bunkering port. Corruption is almost unheard of and such is the low rate of crime that uniformed police are rarely seen on the streets.Yet as Singapore prepares to mark 50 years since independence next year, there is a pervasive sense of unease. The model that built Singapore – based on attracting foreign investment, a steady increase in the population to fuel economic expansion and paternalistic control – will not ensure that the economic miracle continues. "We are now at an inflection point, changing gears, changing pace," says Lee Hsien Loong, the prime minister. "Today [we are] successful, prosperous, [but] not without issues which we have to deal with."Those issues have been multiplying – unlike Singaporeans. With a falling birth rate, Singapore has had to rely on foreign immigrants, such as mainland Chinese who drive public buses or work on building sites, to keep its economy on track. That has strained transport infrastructure and stirred resentment among some ordinary Singaporeans.Income disparity has widened as Singapore has become a tax-friendly financial hub. Wealth-X, a research firm, estimates that there are 255 people with $30 million or more in assets, including property and business holdings, per 1 million people in Singapore – more than eight times the average. One effect has been to make Singapore a magnet for upmarket car makers including Maserati, Lamborghini and McLaren, which opened its first showroom there last year.Meanwhile, a recent study by the Lien Center for Social Innovation at Singapore Management University estimates 10-14 per cent of the permanent population live below a poverty line defined as monthly income of S$1,250 ($962) or less for a four-person household. Those statistics highlight a pressing existential dilemma: can this island country that has spent the past half a century on national development manage a transition to successfully tackling the dilemmas of being a world city?Piyush Gupta, chief executive of DBS, Singapore's biggest bank by assets, says: "Singapore, in a way, is still going through a crisis of identity. Does it really seek to embrace being a global city or not?" He adds: "For London and New York, the answer has been unequivocal over the past several decades. In Singapore's case the jury is out because being a global city comes with attendant pluses and minuses. If you chose not to want to be a global city, that brings into question the economic and growth model that you seek to aspire to."Aside from rising living costs and a widening income gap, many Singaporeans feel that they are losing touch with a concept of national identity nurtured by the ruling People's Action party (PAP).Sudhir Thomas Vadaketh, a local writer, says the combination of globalization, low birth rates and high immigration has "essentially overturned the very essence of a Singaporean identity that our forefathers tried to build".The government has been promoting ways to nurture a "core" Singaporean identity. Ministers argue that increased debate has bolstered a sense of identity, not eroded it. "This idea of a multicultural, multi-religious and multiracial society has become a lot deeper, this sense of our shared identity and sense of shared destiny is a lot stronger," says Heng Swee Keat, education minister and the politician in charge of the independence celebrations.He points out that almost a third of school and university students spend some time overseas on exchanges, much of them funded by the government. That was rare when he was a student, says Mr Heng, 52.Mr Lee has acknowledged the income gap. Last year the prime minister said, "We are not all Ronaldos" – a reference to Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo – "so the government must intervene more to keep ours a fair and just society". That has involved bolstering social safety nets, with almost $S8 billion set aside in benefits for senior citizens.The government has also embarked on an economic restructuring that aims to boost productivity and reduce dependence on foreigners. Singapore's productivity levels are about 70 per cent of those in the US, according to Credit Suisse, well behind Taiwan and Australia but just ahead of Britain.Yet the jury is out on how well that strategy is working, as an International Monetary Fund report said last month. "The planned further slowing inflow of foreign workers, as part of the ongoing economic restructuring, could moderate potential growth and lower competitiveness," it warned. "Productivity improvements might take some time to materialize."Yeoh Keat Chuan, managing director of the Economic Development Board, responsible for attracting investment, says the "inflection point" cited by the prime minister "is as much about going after new and exciting opportunities as well as restructuring the economy".Singapore has managed to shift up the value chain in areas such as storage technology, where it claims to account for 40 percent of production of hard disc drives. It has also invested in higher education to ensure a steady stream of skilled staff for foreign companies such as Emerson, a US engineering company."They do continue to reinvent themselves and that's why we continue to invest here because we see the universities and technical colleges coming out with the talent we need," says Ed Monser, Emerson's chief operating officer.Multinational companies continue to choose Singapore to set up regional headquarters. This year Archer Daniels Midland, the US-based agribusiness, moved its regional headquarters from China, while General Motors shifted the bulk of its non-Chinese international operations from Shanghai.All this highlights Singapore's heightened importance as a southeast Asian hub while the fortunes of its northern rival Hong Kong are increasingly tied to China.Yet with no economic hinterland of its own, Singapore may have to rely still further on financial services – currently about 11 percent of GDP, compared with 15 percent for Hong Kong – to drive much of the next phase of growth.Productivity in Singapore's financial sector has outperformed that in any other financial center, according to the IMF, but Mr Gupta of DBS believes the sector's output will have to rise perhaps as much as 20 per cent of GDP. Singapore's emergence as an offshore hub for the renminbi, the Chinese currency, will help. Its English legal system will be even more important, he says."What creates a good financial center is not just an aggregation of [financial] flows but a rule of law. In this context most of the other alternative sites in Asia still have a ways to go, and that's something that Singapore really has got going for it," he says. Early next year, Singapore plans to open an international commercial court, at which foreign judges will be allowed to sit. That will be the final building block in an effort to turn Singapore into a top commercial arbitration center in Asia.Yet the price Singapore will inevitably pay for expanding financial services is that "you have more bankers, you have more McLarens on the road – and then you have the social angle", says onesenior banker. Early this year, British wealth manager Anton Casey apologized in the face of public anger when he posted on Facebook of his relief at being able to "wash the stench of public transport" off him, having collected his Porsche from the car repair shop.Such sensitivities have tested a ruling party that already had a taste of popular discontent over immigration in the wake of the 2011 general election. While the PAP won just over 60 per cent of the popular vote, it lost six parliamentary seats in what was its worst result since 1965. The PAP will be hoping for better at the next poll, expected either next year or in 2016."Whereas in the past you could be very confident that the PAP would win election after election, now for the first time there is some degree of political uncertainty," says Kishore Mahbubani, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore (NUS).The PAP is also grappling with the rise of a noisy social media, where bloggers are openly critical of government policy and provide a popular alternative to the government-leaning traditional media."The hitherto pristine 'policy lab' that Singapore's policy makers used to operate in is today being monitored by a more critical and skeptical public," says Donald Low, an associate dean at the NUS and lead author of Hard Choices: Challenging the Singapore Consensus.Few believe that the PAP will end up having to share power with the opposition at the next election. But Mr Mahbubani says: "After that? You cannot predict. But what I know for sure is that the PAP will have to keep reinventing itself."Because, if you've been so successful for so long, like any company you want to stick with your tried and tested formulas and then suddenly you have to change after 50 years of success. It's not easy."

Who gives a damn , as i said before , those tell me this report that report from the banks , i wanna see how those monthly reports going to stop foreclosures ?
 
Prices of property has being over priced for the past 3 years , any normalization of prices is just reflective of the actual economic situation in singapore.
 
Allow imports ? Go ahead , see how far they will go . If i am going to run for the next election , i will recommend prosecute the ones which brought us this mess , namely the ones in power the same way LKY did when he was removing his political rivals.
 
The ones in power made millions for the rich and hot money and the withdrawal effects are going to be fully felt in the same nature how US citizens is going to feel at 2009. This is not spreading fear , i am just voicing my concerns which might actually happen.

Money is nothing to them.
Really nothing.  Its whether they fancy or fancy. 
If fancy just buy.
 
Imagine today, if everything to you is three zeros lesser.
You wouldnt fret buying a $300,000 watch becos it would just feel like $300.

Yeah we saw this coming long ago! That's what separates us from those "inflation mongering" agents/speculators @ CondoSingapore
 
Yeah I know money in bank earns peanuts but it's still better than loosing 25% over few years. Money can now pick up cheap and good durians for more profits later!

i will wait for people to die first ,massive bankruptcy is what that is waiting for those property speculators.
 
Expecially many property agents which got greedy.
 
Now where is spring and what is the other fellow's name , maybe they can tell me if the NPL ratio and other numbers, they submit every month will help banks from those poor payers , it is likely that many now are rowing their debt into a bigger one , the longer the authorities take clamp down on this loose credit , the more potential for a larger damage across the economy .
 
 
I quote myself.
 
 

 
Seriously , easy money is never a good way to grow business , everyone knows that. Why would i be crying mother and father when i already expected it to happen?
 
The ones which are crying are the ones which jump in the ship and watch it sink .
 
Why is this happening ? Greed !
 
1. Greed from developers big small new old , typically the small ones which think they can jump on the bandwagon and sell . The biggest ones have enough cash to hold those empty units. Always the smaller ones with no experiences which takes the first hit..
 
2. Greed from property speculators thinking they can make a quick buck from an investment without thinking whether if the timing is right. Especially dumbos which think economies will forever go up.
 
3. Greed from the garmen to sell land at ex prices and not stop the sharp property rises which makes living in singapore so tough and now despite everything we are the most expensive in the world. So is our ministers. Look at their pay , they need to justify their pay , these people are no longer doing things for the people but themselves.
 
4. Greed from property agents , many claim to be gurus after they made easy money from 2009 thinking that they can flip a few units and make , now only to vomit all of those and sitting on a pile of debts. Why i know ? My job.
 
5. Greed from banks , loose loans from easy money makes every feel rich when they aren't. Anyone can easily have cash of up to more than 10x their earnings.
 
 
So who is crying?? Everyone. Those who aren't are those holding cash or debt free. oh ya and those which missed the bandwagon and hoping for everything to crash for them.

Lately I hear stories about friends of friend that bought like 2 units new and are now kan chiong causes prices gone below cost. Good luck to them I say, all say want to rent out to cover cost. The development launch by the hundred per tranche I really wonder how many for rent signs are gonna pop up.
 
That said the prices transacted for some development is still damn high, 1600 psf for D'leedon, I wonder if its developer sale with built in "incentives"

Yes it is developer sale with built in incentives.I was offered at $13xxpsf by developer sales team...
So i dare say all the caveats are built in with incentives.
I was last told that there are still about 100 units unsold?

Macquarie Research? Do they have any credibility or were they misquoted by the reporter.
 
Only 10% increase in house prices between 2009 and today.
 
Excess of 12k units can bring the price down 10%?
 
When I bought a property in 2002 there was 40k private units unsold
 
and also 40k hdb units unsold, totally 80,000 unsold units.
 
There is 1 million homes in Singapore so 12k units going unsold
 
is not going to do much to pull prices down.
 
What is going to pull prices down is people losing their jobs
 
and not being able to pay their mortgage or people buying
 
2 or 3 units and not being able to rent it out to pay the mortgage.

I beg to differ , what is going to pull prices down is the lack of hot money in the region , coupled with an increase perception of a market crash around the corner due to over supply. Though they aren't many unsold but there are many awaiting TOP with the buyers totally stretched beyond their means.
 
Prices still drop despite stable economic conditions.In fact , the economy is still not as bad as it seems they aren't much people losing jobs yet.
 
To me , this time round , asset prices aren't cyclical and a full scale correction is around the corner
 
Policies like importing foreign talents that aren't loyal would only boost our workforce in terms of numbers but not efficiency and capacity. And many MNC's seems to realised those FTs they employ aren't really good enough and thus cutting down on them. Numbers of FTs seems to be dropping on my count but i might be wrong.
 
In this scenario , how will there be rental income when there is an oversupply places and there aren't as much high paying jobs around? It comes to show our leadership thinks using their bottom and has not thought of how to react out to those professionals and instead tries to fill the nation with CHEAPLY imports which makes even exclusive areas look cheap.

major job losses and economy downturn trigger crash
this time round is toward correction
depends how soft or hard the landing is
 
every effort is made to correct the property price especially from govt policy
property price vs income level is way mis-align
 
while we have heard many news and stories with regards to not enough CPF for retirement
if there is any paradigm shift in limiting CPF use for housing ... ho say liao!
i also believe the govt is preparing contingency plan for interest rate hike in 2015/2016
 
i recalled KBW said last time the oversupply of HDB ... took several years to clear, no?

Anyway let me share a story ok?
 
Once a gambler and his friend went to casino
 The gambler was on a winning streak and his friend advised him to stop
Gambler said why stop?  Must make more as the streak will last.  Moreover he looked around and saw many others winning.
Friend advised again to stop
 
Gambler brings in all sorts of reason not to.
Even citing that the casino is encouraging bu giving free food and drinks
 
Well the gambler did not lose everything thankfully becos his friend pulls him out of the casino by force.  But he still went back with much less than he started. 
 
Back at home, the gambler starting blaming the stars, the color of his wife's underwear and even the birthday of his children for causing the loss.  A huge argument ensues with the family and relationships are destroyed.  
 
The gambler then turns his anger on the casino, for the free food and drinks enticing him to play and lose.  For the beautiful picture painted that didnt come true.  He wants casinos to stop such "policies" and lobbies for support from others.  But yet all this while continues going back to the casinos.
 
 
Moral of the story?
The gambler was not ready to lose his pants
He was not ready to face a family breakup
He was not ready to lose his job
He was just simply..........not ready.
 
Hope you all like my bedtime story.

and also 40k hdb units unsold, totally 80,000 unsold units.
 
There is 1 million homes in Singapore so 12k units going unsold
 
is not going to do much to pull prices down.
 
What is going to pull prices down is people losing their jobs
 
and not being able to pay their mortgage or people buying
 
2 or 3 units and not being able to rent it out to pay the mortgage.
 
 

 
 
 

 
I beg to differ , what is going to pull prices down is the lack of hot money in the region , coupled with an increase perception of a market crash around the corner due to over supply. Though they aren't many unsold but there are many awaiting TOP with the buyers totally stretched beyond their means.
 
Prices still drop despite stable economic conditions.In fact , the economy is still not as bad as it seems they aren't much people losing jobs yet.
 
To me , this time round , asset prices aren't cyclical and a full scale correction is around the corner
 
Policies like importing foreign talents that aren't loyal would only boost our workforce in terms of numbers but not efficiency and capacity. And many MNC's seems to realised those FTs they employ aren't really good enough and thus cutting down on them. Numbers of FTs seems to be dropping on my count but i might be wrong.
 
In this scenario , how will there be rental income when there is an oversupply places and there aren't as much high paying jobs around? It comes to show our leadership thinks using their bottom and has not thought of how to react out to those professionals and instead tries to fill the nation with CHEAPLY imports which makes even exclusive areas look cheap.

 
There is no need to beg to deffer as there is nothing you said that is different.
 
All you did is paraphrase what I said and thank you for adding more details.

Anyway let me share a story ok?
 
Once a gambler and his friend went to casino
The gambler was on a winning streak and his friend advised him to stop
Gambler said why stop? Must make more as the streak will last. Moreover he looked around and saw many others winning.
Friend advised again to stop
 
Gambler brings in all sorts of reason not to.
Even citing that the casino is encouraging bu giving free food and drinks
 
Well the gambler did not lose everything thankfully becos his friend pulls him out of the casino by force. But he still went back with much less than he started.
 
Back at home, the gambler starting blaming the stars, the color of his wife's underwear and even the birthday of his children for causing the loss. A huge argument ensues with the family and relationships are destroyed.
 
The gambler then turns his anger on the casino, for the free food and drinks enticing him to play and lose. For the beautiful picture painted that didnt come true. He wants casinos to stop such "policies" and lobbies for support from others. But yet all this while continues going back to the casinos.
 
 
Moral of the story?
The gambler was not ready to lose his pants
He was not ready to face a family breakup
He was not ready to lose his job
He was just simply..........not ready.
 
Hope you all like my bedtime story.
I guess many hv heard similar ones

 
what a lousy FR. zap you.
Why you worry, you already bought at 25% discount right?
 
cannot meh? buy liao den must shout huat huat PAP mah!!! you dunno meh  (not 25%, 18-20%. Unless compared with this year's peak then maybe 22-23% off)
 
 

haha ... no rubbing la
property is not like car
can buy the same model same spec
whether 25% or 50% if you dont buy you could never buy back the same unit
buy when you feel right ;)

 
Ya, correct. I really really like the one i got :)
 
anyway, HUAT HUAT PAP!!!! WAN SHUI WAN SHUI WAN WAN SHUI!!!!! you all mai fearmonger ah!!! Choi choi!!!
 
 

mock, price drop 50% ... buy 1 more unit for rental ... huat ah!
 

 
 
Price drop 50% than i think other ppl will have more bigger problem den me liao. Need more luck than panty luck.

No offense , dude there is a difference between losing jobs and not losing them which i had clearly mentioned.
 
What is going to pull prices down is people losing their jobs
 
Prices still drop despite stable economic conditions.In fact , the economy is still not as bad as it seems they aren't much people losing jobs yet.
 
 
Neither did i say not paying , i merely said stretched beyond their means which means they are stretched but not to point of non payment.
 
 
and not being able to pay their mortgage
 
Though they aren't many unsold but there are many awaiting TOP with the buyers totally stretched beyond their means.
 
Not paying would meant foreclosure.
 
There is 1 million homes in Singapore so 12k units going unsold
 
is not going to do much to pull prices down.
 
Prices still drop despite stable economic conditions. <-- I am saying that they are many going to top which are as good as unsold as they are in desperate need to sell to avoid losing more money
 
 
 
or people buying 2 or 3 units and not being able to rent it out to pay the mortgage.
 
how will there be rental income when there is an oversupply places and there aren't as much high paying jobs around?
 
It comes to show our leadership thinks using their bottom and has not thought of how to react out to those professionals and instead tries to fill the nation with CHEAPLY imports which makes even exclusive areas look cheap.
 
i am saying the state of how garmen plans to flood the markets trying to fill singapore with cheap labor and nothing with not being able to rent out , you can still rent out but at a cheap price which is what i am saying when i say even exclusive areas look cheap, an income would mean u make a profit after cost and not being able to rent out to pay the mortgate is totally different
 
 
If you wanna say i paraphase , up to you , to me it is just selective reading and you are the only one doing paraphasing. Maybe my england is not good for you to misunderstand , my fault.

and say wah we are so smart ah, we are so zhun ah, we are like geniuses ah.
 
Please lah which market doesn't go down?
 
Are people so small that they need to boost what little

I just don't understand your phrase "stretched beyond their means"  but not to the point of not
 
being able to pay their mortgage.
 
 
If they can pay their mortgage then it clear they are not "stretched beyond their means" 
 
They may be stretched to the very ends of their means but certainly not beyond.

My flower power eyes looks like 2009 property price index is about 130 +/-
 
and today is over 200.
 
Where did they get an increase of 10%?
 
What are they smoking?
 
 

Yes... your flower power eye needs a better correction.
 
See... they said 2009. It could be Jan 2009 or 31 Dec 2009.
Looking at the graph... Dec 2009 was about 170 already.
 
Then... 2014 Q1 was still above 200 but by Q3... maybe is already 190.
So, 190 - 10% is 170.
Back to 2009 level is no wrong ma......

Haha good post. 
 
They are absolutely right!
 
We are already back to 2009 levels.
 
Whoever said I want to buy at 2009 price
 
here is your chance! Although I am sure
 
they meant buy at Jan 2009 prices but never say clearly.

 There are people who dont mind stretching beyond their means just to own a private property. Rising interest rate and price dropping will not deter them, as long as they look good on the outside. But losing their job will hit these people hard and that could be their final nail into the coffin. Some people have to see the coffin then their tears will fall. 不见棺材不掉泪。

Think its not that they dunno....it just that they think it won't happen to them. Just ask any gambler and they know that the odds are against them. Out of 10 gamblers, 9 will lose. BUT out of the 10 gamblers, all 10 believe they are the 1 out of 10 winner.

Quite jia lat leh, no recession already like that, imagine when recession. Lucky the government put brakes on the property sky rocket few years back (I still feel it's abit too late though ), if not the implications will be far worst not now but in the future.

I am surprised interest rate is so low and job market so stable yet so many hammer sales, imagine interest rates were to double and rental market continues to soften...  still don't see a crash but property market often over/ under perform.  So expect the unexpected.

I am surprised interest rate is so low and job market so stable yet so many hammer sales, imagine interest rates were to double and rental market continues to soften...  still don't see a crash but property market often over/ under perform.  So expect the unexpected.Bro, the reason is fairly simple. 
There are many many leveraged property investments. 
 when prices come off, no one wants to benthe last man standing as i hv mentioned before many many times.  Hammer sales are due usually to overleveraged situations yet not always the case.  
However increase in hammer sales is a direct reflection of the buying appetite.
 
If, and if only our property market is made largely by real demand, then there is no fear of sudden huge selling pressures unless serious recession loss of income etc...
But that is not the case.
 
Our property prices are held up much more so by investors and speculators.
When the measures came into play, you see the first level at standstill, ie speculators. Bringing a dip in prices.
 
We are now in the second layer, ie investors. It is clear that this category is now at standstill.
So a further dip is inevitable.
 
There are several types of investors too but for simplicity, we can breakdown investors into 2 types, long term (10yrs and beyond) and short term (5yrs to 10yrs)
We can further breakdown these into various other categories which i wont be bothered to highlight here.
All these impact the market.  Nobody can truly pinpoint and like the stock markets, it takes a good understanding of fundaments, some reading of price historicals and lastly but not least, a fair amount of gut feel.
 
Bottomline, direction is down, velocity is increasing.  All smack within my personal forecast after employing the above three major elements.  As Jamesc said, i am trying to boost my own self esteem, yay! Woohoo.
 
But dont take my words on where we're headed,i am just a low level, table wiping, below average man in the street, unlike the many true gurus like......you know who lah....😅😄😜

Good analysis.  I also agree that the bull market has lasted too long and that means we have lots of over stretched investors, the smart ones got out earlier, the average one are trying to get out now and there are those who are still in denial.  
 
To me, the direction is clear lah, govt wants price to correct and I think they won't withdraw the CM till a meaningful correction, the question is how much?  I also no guru and I could be wrong but I am of the view that prices, asset and equity, have raced ahead of fundamentals due to QE and the game cannot go on forever.

The CMs cannot be withdrawn until the first clear signs of economic crisis emerge.
 
The purpose of the CMs is not to crash the property market. That would be political suicide. The government is aware of the reversal of hot money that is quickening each passing day. Financial restraint is the key intention of the TDSR and other measures.
 
The price corrections that we see right now are the desired effects of the CMs. As T2 mentioned, speculators have been largely weeded out of the market. The weaker investors are also yielding to the falling prices. 
 
Once the prices stabilise, it means that only two groups remain - the strong investors (high networth using light leverage who are virtually immune to any run-of-the-mill economic crisis) and home-owners.
 
These two groups will form the foundation of the market pricing levels at that point in time and the government will have the flexibility of withdrawing CMs to stimulate demand (on need-to basis) as a counter to weakening market conditions.
 
Cash is king at the moment because upside in the property market is virtually zero while downside risk is increasing.

TDSR is Good, I do hope that it will stay forever be it whenever is there financial crisis or not. Because of tdsr it forces people to have a reality check, it forces bank to no choice and not run into mistake of easy money lending. Too much loose monetary policy and bank reckless lending is no good as it will bring great issue of paying bCk in the future that the person may will not afford it .

Good for business on easy money lending by banks?
 
Think of it this way, if there is no TDSR, I believe prices would have sky rocketed a lot higher then it is currently now, or worst, the bubble might already burst. It maybe good for short term or for medium term, but it is defiantly not good for long term when people wake up the senses base on false hope that they can buy and sell at higher price at already very expensive housing prices.
 
What about if there is interest rate rise, those that take loan that far exceeded what they could afford because of rise of interest payment, they will be force to default on loan, or worst lose job because of economy downturn and still have such a huge loan to pay off, good for long term business meh??  
 
So TDSR to stay forever is good, as it forces bank to have no choice and not running mistake of reckless lending be it during good economy or bad economy.

Good for business on easy money lending by banks?
 
Think of it this way, if there is no TDSR, I believe prices would have sky rocketed a lot higher then it is currently now, or worst, the bubble might already burst. It maybe good for short term or for medium term, but it is defiantly not good for long term when people wake up the senses base on false hope that they can buy and sell at higher price at already very expensive housing prices.

Yes TDSR should stay forever........   
Those who take big loans to buy cars without cash backing behind also cannot buy properties so easily.
Love the TDSR, hopefully they tighten it to 50%.  Even better.. Muayhahahahahaha

No fear lah, just normal course.
I forecasted it happening in early 2013 and it has moved accordingly.
The big kick in the nuts is expected in 2015.
Not sure how the reaction will be, but better be prepared, with a shield for blocking but also with a sword for opportunity.
 
You no problem lah.  You are buying a home to move on, neither speculator nor investor, so as long as the price is correct, finances comfortable, no prob lah.

If Singapore were a stand-alone economy with no dependence on external economies, having a stringent TDSR permanently in place would not be an issue.
 
As you have pointed out, it helps to maintain financial prudence on the part of borrowers and responsible lending on the part of financiers.
 
Unfortunately Singapore is closely linked to the global economy and is very much affected by the monetary policies of other countries. Loose lending by the central banks of the U.S.A. and now the EU means that monetary/currency warfare is ongoing. 
 
Much as we would hope for an economy that is built on good values such as industriousness and innovation, a lot of the global financial markets are driven by morally-hazardous financial wizardry today. 
 
Stringent money-lending and financing policies will result in investors shunning our country in search for greener pastures. This will lead to fewer businesses being set up in Singapore and consequently fewer jobs being created.
 
As such, TDSR needs to be tweaked in line with the dynamics of the global economy. It cannot be cast in concrete.

well said. play safe don't work for long ...
if others play risky or even play dirty ...
we got to fight back ... else we'll lose big time
 
monetary policy
interest rate
currency exchange rate
low tax
foreign direct investment incentives
ease of immigration & FT to work here
etc etc etc
 
all the above will put on pressure to local market ... but that's how things work
the big question is how fast govt react and how "smart" are they with all the information they got to plan ahead

monetary policy, see interest rate generally
Interest rate, just follow blindly , easy.
Currency exchange policy, unchanged since a long time
Low tax, errr errr err.  Very high indirect taxes
Foreign direct investment incentives , plentiful
Ease and flow of immigrants, already f**ked up big time.
Etc etc etc, i am really keen to see.

At risk of sounding like a broken record player that keeps repeating the same message ad nauseam, Singapore is a tiny boat in a sea of much larger vessels.
 
Without a unique proposition/economic tool that allows us to stand out, we are always at risk of becoming fodder for the governments of larger countries or even the larger hedge funds that have international reach.
 
We tread carefully and diplomatically to avoid stepping on the toes of the bigger boys and at the same time avoiding appearing as easy prey to the predatory funds that constantly prowl the oceans for coordinated short-selling.
 
So far we have been lucky but how long can our good fortune last?
 
Our unique proposition has been a strong team of leaders found in the old guard. Charismatic, knowledgeable, intelligent and well-connected, the old guard served as our primary safeguard against malice coming from abroad. 
 
Today as the old guard passes on one by one, we need to quickly find a replacement unique proposition. And we have yet to find it.

Which is why , i am pretty skeptical of the current social political economy (google destep), well i warn of all this long long time ago , no one bothered . Many tell me all sort of bs , including one which told me that those MONTHLY REPORTS will be more than enough to "protect" against a potential "meltdown" in the regional credit .
 
I don't know if they are farking stupid or is my england so poor that they simply cannot understand what i am trying to put across.
 
There are many people like this around , many i know are patriotic, just only they don't wish to step up the plate as the world is their oyster , the self serving monkeys on the trees are throwing everything at them to protect themselves and no one willing to open up the reach neither have any will to listen to what others have to say. I can only say when the monkey king is down and when all those monkeys scatter , those which are willing to help will come back. This i am pretty sure.
 
If they don't i will beg them to come back if i need to. Our country needs salesman , damn good ones to sell Singapore on the ideologies which will push us further forward , not paper chasing scholars which have never step out of the tree and venture in the jungle and use deep deep england to "convince" others. Non of them can do a proper speech without looking at their notes.
 
Just look here , plenty of fellows tell me all sort bs , mixing global credit with local credit and some tell me all sort of crap on how good their MIK selections are when they fail to acknowledge the fact if one is capable they would probably be owning 3 instead of the pathetic "value" for money choice which i have time and time against proven to them that , in fact , they are cent wise and dollar stupid.
 
In fact , even the so called educated ones which told me he was talking his masters failed to support his stance and prove to me based on a few hundred more monthly , i could be driving a conti instead of my fit. He has yet to prove me this point despite all those time i have given him.
 
While i don't claim to be smarter than many , to me as long as i can make enough for myself by putting my ideas into action, i have already answered their queries. I am not good in my language , this i acknowledge but i compensate with deep thought which those smarter than me can understand. I don't expect everyone to like what i say , but i just say what i think and do , i don't think i need anyone to like me , i am not seeking this affection but more than that i seek to offer some opinions on how things "can" go.
 
Many here accuse me of paraphasing all the time and selectively read whatever i said failing to understand what i am trying to put across as a whole yet accuse me of those very actions they too are doing. I don't deny i too do selective reading , never attempt to hide it.
 
Many here preach but don't practice. I am worried , worried that things would only go further south , foreign investments have dried up and many don't even know , ask yourself a simple question , what value have you created for Singapore ?
 
How much money have you brought into Singapore? What technological advancements have you done for people to come here and "learn" from you ,  how can one bring more ideology of what is to offer in Singapore where you can't find any where else. I don't see clowns asking these questions here , they tell me many years of up sure come down , expecting it to come back up after a few year but asked when and how ? ... no answer. LOL , ok thats all the rant i can think of , have a great evening,

It depends
 
During good economy TDSR restrict them  and bank lose many potential customers
 
 
However during downturn the TDSR will protect the bank better and will have less bad debts

Just a thought which I am thinking out loud if I am a foreigner or foriegn entity , would I have any problems if I already made a pile the past few years in cash and now I have a couple of properties which I think might lose me money ., should I just bail out and take the cash I have and move it elsewhere before it crashes and default on the other properties which I got caught in , anyway the most I don't go back to that small island which has nothing , they used to have a pretty nice beach at east coast and chose to let it rot now.
 
Well no issues ,I made my piles time to move on ,good bye?

To the typical investor which forms the majority, it is all about the growth story of whatever is being invested in.
 
As long as the prospects of growth are good, the investors will continue to pump in the monies.
 
Once the growth story is shown to be completely non-viable, investors will leave on the next departing plane.
 
Singapore was the poster boy (girl) of growth. From fishing village to metropolitan city-state, the transformation has been rapid and unrelenting. The phenomenal growth attracted attention of investors all over the world and many came to set up shop or to invest in properties/equities over the last few decades.
 
Today as we sit comfortable, our third/fourth generation of children generally happy with their lot, we do not realise that the growth story momentum is at its weakest (except for when we first separated from Malaysia in 1965).
 
Investors buy into the potential for future gains, not for swanky-looking buildings and landscapes that are present right now unless these contribute to the potential for a good growth story.
 
What is the growth story of Singapore as we move into the next phase of nation-building?
 
We are waiting for the architect to step out and paint us that clear and astounding yet confidence-inspiring plan, as Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Keng Swee, et al had done in the early years.

To me I think it would be easier if they removed the social levels they surround themselves within, changes involved pain and sacrifices which many have never experienced , racial riots , bombing etc etc.
 
No major changes ever done without a major crisis , to me one might happen in the next few years and I am sensing our leadership trying to bail out already.
 
As I said , prosecution is what worries on singaporeans and never foriegners.ehich is why I said we need a damn good salesman to pitch whatever crap which we can think of and make it a reality.

Good analysis. I also agree that the bull market has lasted too long and that means we have lots of over stretched investors, the smart ones got out earlier, the average one are trying to get out now and there are those who are still in denial.
 
To me, the direction is clear lah, govt wants price to correct and I think they won't withdraw the CM till a meaningful correction, the question is how much? I also no guru and I could be wrong but I am of the view that prices, asset and equity, have raced ahead of fundamentals due to QE and the game cannot go on forever.

 
many people say that real demand has fallen
 
if that is the case, why is CM not withdrawn (which the developers are hoping for)
 
why is there a need to intervene and curb demand?
 
i suppose the answer is that demand is still freaking strong
 
removing CM is like unleashing the hordes of investors/ speculators rushing in to push the markets to new highs 
 
that is just my lowly opinion. feel free to disregard as rubbish since as i only sell, not buy property

CM not remove maybe is like why cpf is not remove?Cpf minimum sum has cost PAP to lose more vote why they nv remove?
 
If i remember correctly gov said they trying to create soft landing.
Cpf not remove cos scare ppl anyhow spend with lump sum of money and wont have enough for ur golden age (actually gov dont want our potential problem to be their problem)
CM not remove cost scare ppl anyhow chiong in and buy to speculate.
 
CM is to deter speculation not true home ownership.
 
Bro if u gov do not do anything to stop or ease property speculation, sg may end up like blumount.
 
Feel free to disregard as rubbish too, since im not buying and selling too :)

banks arent allowed to hold properties which is why theyre auctioned or sold off... in 2009 crash, the earliest buyers werent the banks, it was some lawyers n individuals who knew abt the firesales n they gang up n makan n flip... i was pretty active back then so i know wat was going on...
 
banks are really useless at timing property one, theyre either too conservative or too aggressive.

that is just my lowly opinion. feel free to disregard as rubbish since as i only sell, not buy property  
 
 

Becoz people were buying thinking real estate is a one direction bet? I thought CM is to prevent govt having to bail out everyone, from middle class to poor class, to developers to banks as if left alone could possibly lead to a full blown housing crisis. Seriously, prices are crazy and yield are crazier.  I know what I can do with 1-2 million and it is definitely not property at the moment, only downside and limited upside.  
 
Demand?  Real demand can only be seen when interest rate, supply, yield normalise.  Seriously net yield of 2% is freaking real demand?  But then, please feel free to disregard my opinion as rubbish as I have no intention to buy or sell.

Let the shakeout continue for a few more years for the weak holders.
 
Then maybe can see some rational sentiment return.

many people say that real demand has fallen
 
if that is the case, why is CM not withdrawn (which the developers are hoping for)
 
why is there a need to intervene and curb demand?
 
i suppose the answer is that demand is still freaking strong
 
removing CM is like unleashing the hordes of investors/ speculators rushing in to push the markets to new highs 
 
that is just my lowly opinion. feel free to disregard as rubbish since as i only sell, not buy property  
 
 
when the picture has been painted clearly, prices would have gone up another 100%
 
so better to place your bets now and buy while it is cheap, i'd say  
 
 
Correct, quite lowly and should be disregarded as rubbish, 
Who say real demand has fallen? 
Real demand pertains to those buying their first homes and those who are buying for own use.
That has not fallen for sure. That grows with population.  However high prices and CMs have naturally forced real demand to move a notch lower.  But real demand is aways there lah.
 
What you mean is speculative demand, not real demand. Speculative demand is fueled largely by future prices and financial capability to enter market.  Of course, the govt has to keep CMs there to prevent this demand.  Speculative demand has been quashed by the policies, yes, and correctly so.  There are many people who cannot afford but want to buy Porsches, Mercs, and BMWs too.  Is that real demand?   Until now you still talking rubbish? Muayahahahahaa

demand plunge 50% !!!
mai spread fear ... mai spread fear ... lol
 
i think demand is there but many cannot afford after the TDSR ... hehe

just by looking at demand alone is like looking at one side of the coin. So what if real demand grows? if the city cannot keep up with the supply, prices also under pressure to increase 
 
real demand can turn into investment or speculative demand vice versa depending on the market situation
 
anyway demand is always at point in time. and right now at this point in time, investment demand is still rocket high hence the need for CM to prevent prices from reaching unsustainable levels
 
with so many interventions, prices only dipped 5% this year... the fact that prices moved marginally with huge drop in volume suggests that many are waiting at sidelines to get their 2nd or 3rd properties
 
the moment CM is released, all hell will break loose
 
even if CM is kept, the standoff will still last for another few years

CM is not really to prevent govt from bailing everyone out
 
if they have real intention to bail ppl from committing financial suicide, they would have intervene and stop the man on the street from investing in overseas condo long ago
 
CM is the govt's desperate last resort to contain the booming market for which part of the root cause was due to their own policy failure between 2003-2007
 
anyway, the market can stay irrational longer than we can stay solvent, so dun be greedy and wait too long, in case miss the boat again hor   (now already corrected a whopping 5%)

How well the property market perform,really depend on how well Singapore as a whole will perform in the next 5 to 10yrs. 
 
There is always a trade off. Ppl want opposition to form the main spine they must accept a slower population growth, resulting in slower economical growth. Hopefully some smart person can come up with a better solution.

Leverage kills, both man in the street, banks and the economy.  
 
Policy failure? Agree but supply has caught up since, so don't be so fixated on demand, look at supply as well.  If expectation of price increase is lacking, doubt many will invest with yield of 2%.  With resident population of 4 million plus (exclude FW and domestic helpers) and HDB and private residential stock of more than 1.5 million units and assuming average 3.5 pax per unit, we are already in oversupply situation, it is very evident.  Vacancy should exceed 10% soon and when it does and / or is close to those level, I may consider buying, if And only if I strike Toto.  
 
Well, there are much better investment opportunities with the type of d/p and stamp duties required for RE investment these days.

different markets we are talking about
 
I am referring to private residential market  
 
 
 
 
 
 Private home prices down almost 5% in 2014

 

Dec 12, 2014
 

  
Prices of private properties in Singapore fell by 4.79 percent during the first nine months of 2014, compared to an annual increase of 2.1 percent in the same period last year, revealed a report from Global Property Guide.
On a quarterly basis, prices of private units dipped by 0.38 percent in Q3 from the previous three months.
At the same time, residential demand in the city-state is dropping. The report stated that sales of housing units plunged 38.6 percent to 1,465 units in the third quarter from last year, according to data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).
Singapore’s economy is also slowing, with forecasts of 2.96 percent growth this year, down from 3.9 percent in 2013, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Of the 10 Asian markets tracked in the report, only Singapore and China saw house prices decline during the year.

i agree that there are better instruments giving better risk-reward
 
however, real estate will still be in demand even with highly compressed yield as buyers are looking forward to long term capital appreciation
 
As for supply, i am not so sure if it has caught up, or if it will be oversupply in the next 5 yrs. I think your 3.5 person per unit is a little generous

Honestly mate... i wld prefer to take propertyguru's reports with a pinch of salt considering they have vested interest...  
 
they failed to point out the 4.79% drop is largely contributed by luxury house pricing plunge over the course of the year... normal houses decline is not that substantial due to stronger holding power..

Cannot really blame them too, i am also guilty of that sometimes
 
I sold all my stocks last year when i thought it was very high
 
it dropped for a while and now it is back slightly higher
 
but i have to rationalize and justify my own actions, and keep telling all my friends that the market will tank very soon, and i was right to sell last year. Otherwise i will have to admit that i made a mistake

yes u are right, the luxury market dropped more than 5%
 
hence using simple math, it means that normal housing prices have actually gone up this year!

i agree that there are better instruments giving better risk-reward
 
however, real estate will still be in demand even with highly compressed yield as buyers are looking forward to long term capital appreciation
 
As for supply, i am not so sure if it has caught up, or if it will be oversupply in the next 5 yrs. I think your 3.5 person per unit is a little generous

Yeah, 3.5 is on the conservative side, If we use 3.8 or 4.0, the supply overhang is worse.

the moment they appointed ah khaw as housing head, i consperm knew he was gona repeat history of hdb boom bust... he is nothing more than a figurehead to simply follow instructions n flood the mkt w new properties coz that was the main complaint in GE2011, & made worse due to FT import reduction...
 
now whole island suffering again... but those who studied the prop mkt from early 90s to now wld have seen it coming a mile away...
 
i simplify the prop bull n bear dynamics for u:
 
Bull:
1. increase population by import more FTs/PRs etc
2. increase garmen spending & launch projects to increase jobs, eg. casino, sportshub
 
Bear:
1. decrease population by importing less FTs/PRs etc
2.decrease garmen spending & launch projects & decrease jobs, eg. casino due to social concerns etc.
 
right now we are in the bear scenario... garmen is waiting for everyone to suffer first then go backt bull scenario IMO...

I give my honest opinion.
 
Bull (shit) :
1. Increase population by importing more FTs/PRs ( end up ) , increase more FW and leeches leeching our system and stuff increasing expediture. See how many "sponsored" PRs leeching on our medical services in Sg. From what i know , most of them do not even pay tax , if so why should they be using the subsized rates?
 
2. Increase garmen spending & launch projects to increase jobs , eg. casino , sportshub  , if the leaders can think of such a bright idea , hot money won't be flowing out. Have you actually spoken to the leaders and see how well heeled they are? They don't even seem to be concerned with what happens around the world in terms of technology and concerned with whatever we can bring in to improvise and to make it ours.
 
Bear (crap)
1. Decreasing population by importing less FTs/PRs etc , Singapore grew its fastest when there aren't much PRs , when there is an explosion of local population growth and not based on FWs. I am not sure how you define FTs but most i see are crap FWs which aren't capable of helping , they are only here for the money and not many are actually delivering goods they promised. At least this is what i see on the financial sector. We are on the good track to remove leeches from the system.
 
2. Decreasing garmen spending & launch projects & decrease jobs, eg. casino due to social concerns etc., without foreign investments , singapore would be where we are , in fact we should be getting more foreign investments and less garmen spending , the actual garmen spending we should be doing is to improve the general skill set of our people to match with any country in terms of price and quality. They are wasting their money "beautifying" singapore's landscape while removing plenty of local culture which lures others to come back here AGAIN. What is the use of that many pretty buildings when you are bringing in all those population (china and indian shit along with their bad attitudes) and dilute the multi cultural acceptance and mixture which has made us unique to the world.
 
To me , i do not think your points are valid but that is just me , i might be wrong. It is just how the rich make money. Don't be so dumb to think they do not have a leg in it. As for the garmen , i do not think they are prepare for whatever that happens from now on, TSDR is just a immediate stop gap to prevent further blood letting , without that , we would be seeing a full crash which will make many bankrupted and no NPL reports can stop this from happening. I have studied more than well on the how US property bubble crashed , Detroit became bankrupted 2013 due to failures to forsee future trends and how we need to consistently evolve to survive towards the next century. Our neighbors are already waking up , it is time for the strawberries to stop dreaming and start working.

That we have mentioned and highlighted many times.  
Therefore recent price indices which show minute drop must be taken with a table spoonful of salt.
Better to survey and get facts properly instead of purely relying on such statistics.
 
I consider this a soft cooling measure aiding the buyers with an objective to make prices more realistic.
At least they are on the right side this time.  
 
Bring property prices down may not necessarily have a deflationary effect overall as cited by some stakeholders.  The money which does not go into overpaying for a property can then be channelled to other more efficient parts of our economy.
 
Thanks

Take note of the number of lots vs no. of units. Some have less number of lots vs units!!

short term a little too late but longer term no worries... NY was the first city to recover back to peak prices after the last recession.
 
as for SG, my longview guess is itll perform similar to current swiss prop, 2-3% inflation tracked gains per annum & will continue to attract big $ for capital protection. gone are the days of 100% gains over few yrs barring an asian financial crisis again...
 
i do feel that garmen will remove the CMs gradually to ease if any deflationary impact upcoming

Unless you are FT and can take the money and get the hell out of Singapore.
Otherwise you would hv lost a decent size place in a convenient area. 
If doing a swop its LPPL if need to buy another one unless downgrade.
Not to different from cars.  
Basically primary home better dont play.
好好做人.
 
Then again some people are daring enough to make the move to sell when high.
High risk high returns.  I can respect those decisions and their value
 
There are also many people who are not able to handle a bundle of cash in their hands.
End up squandering and mis using.  I have met too many of such folks.
Hope thats not the case for the folks here

They paid $340k for it but am sure it doesnt include fittings and reno.
If it truly looks like a showflat, they would hv spent a fair bit.
 
No matter what,for the seller it would make "sense" cashing out especially since he works in the west.
I cant imagine having to drive 30km one way everyday to work.
I think most people would do the same. Cash out and move west, save up some money for investments.
Any background on the sucker er i mean buyer of the flat?
 
Hopefully not to buy a $300k car or a $50k watch

Err they still looking for a new place.  What can 900k buy now in the west?
 
Also they probably spent 100 to 150k for the renovation of pinnacle flat since it looked like a showflat.
 
they would probably spend the same or more to reno their new place since they seemed quite the house proud sort looking at the pinnacle flat example
 
In the end maybe high cash outflow and debt on new condo despite the gains
 
But then again i maybe wrong since I am a sour grape peasant
 
They could have bought a 3 room hdb in the west and wisely kept the money for retirement

Although it may be a different question.
It is totally related.
If wrong step made, $900k also gone.
 
And the truth is $900k is really very very very average in todays Singapore.
Most people already have at least $700k cash in savings.  Dont believe, ask Enye.
 
Heeeehee

Yes but the follow up is a very related question although different, old friend.
The value of money is only when it is spent.
So absolute growth is definitely not the only thing becos they are doing a sell/buy.
 
To truly partake in the upswing of the property market, you MUST HAVE MORE THAN ONE PROPERTY.  Otherwise any profit taken will still have to be placed back on the table.
Same for cars, watches etc.....
I think can le as investment
Thats the problem.
If really can, it means we have a big loophole in our public housing system.
Although i too believe that there will never be a foolproof win-for-all policy / system but big holes must quickly be plugged.

i fully agree that the one and only property is not for "flipping" and sell high also buy high if the market is buoyant
 
nonetheless, i also agree that the 1st hdb property if buy/sell timely, it does give the owner a leg up
 
i have seen 2-3 cases in my office that young sporean at the age of 25-28 buy 1st bto, sell and upgrade to private condo
 
yes, upgrading to condo means more loan but the bto is not fully paid off anyway. quickly sell right after 5 years MOP and then rollover to private condo. the condo that they stay now is also an asset rising in value. this is also why private condo no $1M no talk. but govt said upgrader is not the reason property price is high. i am not worry about the 2-3 cases in my office because when their parent kick the bucket they got few hundreds K inheritance (this need another thread ... lol)
 
i am not saying like buy and sell making nett profit type. i am saying the first bto does give sporean a leg up to upgrade and some downgrade to cash out.
 
if buy another hdb and then use the cash out money to buy a used GTR or Porsche is a different story

No need explain so much lah, i purposely tease you.  Any first property will give anyone a leg up to upgrade.  Otherwise it wont be called upgrade, it will be called buying first property, muayhahahahahah.
 
I know one idiot, who sold his HDB, pocket a small profit of $100k nett after paying everything.
Never tasted the feeling of "so much" money before and thought he could double up at casino.
Of course in the end, you guys can guess what happened lah. 
KNN f**king stupid fool, i really pity his wife and kid.

But i would dare say most people know that you shouldnt arm yourself with profits from selling your primary residence to walk into a casino thinking that you can double the takings.

If wrong step made, $900k also gone.
 
And the truth is $900k is really very very very average in todays Singapore.
Most people already have at least $700k cash in savings.  Dont believe, ask Enye.

Well nothing wrong financially selling a place for 900k when it is bought at 300k
 
If one is wise , they will keep the money and rent a place and wait for asset prices to drop.
 
To me , it makes sense as long as that joker knows what he is doing but if he isnt then we might see him staying in far out of town areas and waste his money away.

To a number of them, the concern was how the resale value of their flats would be affected by all this. One of them was project manager Vicky Naidu, 33, who said that rejecting the flat "is a very tough decision".

Refund should be rejected on the following basis:
 
Even if HDB had not stated that there would be a columbarium there, URA is still within their rights to re-designate any area to whatever they want. That wet market across the road? That could be a cemetery (or MRT station) if URA decides it.

Prices of private residential property dropped 4.0 percent for the whole of 2014, revealed flash estimates of the URA price index.
In the last quarter of 2014, prices declined by 1.0 percent, higher than the 0.7 percent decrease in the previous three-month period. In a statement, URA said this is the fifth consecutive quarter of price falls.
Prices of non-landed private homes declined in all market segments.

Over in the Rest of Central Region (RCR), prices were down 1.2 percent, higher than the previous 0.4 percent dip.
As for the Outside Central Region (OCR), prices dropped 0.9 percent, higher than the 0.3 percent decrease in the quarter before.
Prices of landed properties fell 1.1 percent compared to the 1.8 percent slide previously.

reality is that real estate price is very high and cannot drop
 
hence to make units affordable, they started with mm units
 
then the cancer creeps to making 800sqft 3 bedrooms
 
then they tried 60 yrs lease
 
now trying reducing finishing
 
finally they will sell you the rights to construct your own unit for the land price they paid to PAP + 20% profit margin

Easy money over , seeing that the property prices are cooling down , all the pattern come out liaoz. The building is not within your premises what right do you have to decide whether what is built there , i have seen my neighbours with their mother's ashes in their flats , so should i complain to HDB that my neighbour is doing this and i am sensitive to it?? Most temples have this in them , it is nothing new , the fact is how many actually go into a temple and find it out for themselves ? Nowadays people expect to be spoonfed and all the way inside the mouth.
 
What is new? Speculation after that wanna pull out because of a columbarium ? Not happy sell it when you get it , you sign a contract , wanna withdraw then withdraw by foreiting your deposits.

This depends on how he defines ""home" , i have friends which their homes are the office where they spent more than 14hours in , the place you define as home , he only goes in does his wash up , sleep and go back to work. Doesn't even do laundry as he sends it for washing outside. He could even stay in a hotel if he wants and it would probably be "cheaper" than buying a property in a falling market. Of course this example is a single staying alone might apply , might not to the ones with a family unless they have an alternative.
 
If for a family , then home might have another different defination all together but i still think if they are able to find an alternative and yet cheaper than buying why not? I have heard of a family moving back to their parents , one to take care of their aging parents and two make use of the existing arrangements to "make" money.
 
It is more towards , knowing what they are doing vs one which doesn't.

I bought many properties and sold many , i do not call them "homes" , i rented some out to the nicest of people where they call them homes , some have stayed for more than 6 years with their families. They help me take care of the furniture and clean it properly and treat it as their own.
 
The only home i call home , is a small room in my parents flat whom i am still staying at. It is the company thats is more important to the place and that is what makes it "home"

agree. if u are renting purely to wait for a crash in the market, it could get very risky.
 
everyone was expecting crash to be imminent in 2008/9. When central banks flood the mkt, everyone thought it would not last more than a couple of years. After 6 years, the market is still waiting for bear phase
 
case in point (true story) - A sold his condo in 2007, thinking that the market is toppish and with subprime concerns etc, expected the market to drop within 1 or 2 years, and hoped to buy a landed for a good price. Ended up renting until 2013 and cannot tahan anymore and bought a house which cost a million more than what it cost back in 2007. Not to mention he burnt $400k on renting over the years.

	Interest rates up as S'pore dollar falls
 

Siow Li Sen
The Business Times
Tuesday, Jan 06, 2015

Local interest rates have been on a slow upwards creep, and on the first working day of the New Year, rose to a 52-week high as the Singapore dollar continues to weaken against the greenback.
The key three-month Sibor - or Singapore interbank offered rate, on which most home loans are pegged - rose to 0.45738 per cent on Friday, up 17.6 per cent from the low of 0.38885 per cent on Feb 21.
The benchmark rate had been flatlining for much of the first half of last year until it began its slow rise from August, then rose steadily as the United States dollar rallied.
The Singapore dollar has fallen to four-year lows against the US dollar. At Friday's rate of 1.328, it is down more than 7 per cent from July 23 high of 1.238.
Observers say Singapore interest rates are now tied to the strength of the US dollar and will move further up even in the absence of rate hikes from the US Federal Reserve. The Fed is expected to raise rates in the second half of this year.
"I suspect a large part of the Sibor's upward creep is due to the SGD weakness," said Selena Ling, OCBC Bank economist.
The latest growth data released last week showed that the Singapore economy continues to slow and, with not much cost pressures, the Singdollar is likely to remain weak.
The Singapore economy grew a weaker-than-expected 1.5 per cent year on year in the fourth quarter of last year, slowing from the third quarter's 2.8 per cent expansion as the manufacturing sector shrank in the final quarter, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry on Friday. a
Full-year 2014 growth was 2.8 per cent, down from 2013's 4.1 per cent.
There is also "the softer gross domestic product growth coupled with benign inflationary environment which does not warrant an overly aggressive monetary policy stance", Ms Ling added.
She said another factor for tighter Singdollar liquidity has been "intensifying competition for SGD deposits, especially over the year end".
OCBC's forecast for three-month Sibor is 0.55 per cent and 0.69 per cent for the middle and end of this year, respectively.
DBS Bank projects that the Singdollar will head to 1.33 by the fourth quarter of this year and the three-month Sibor to reach 0.60 per cent then.
United Overseas Bank is more bearish - it expects that the start of the US interest rate normalisation in June this year will see further downward pressures on the Singdollar this year.
UOB's forecast for the exchange rate remains at 1.34 as of the end of the second quarter of this year, said the bank, in its first quarter of the year outlook.
"With the SGD Sibor positively correlated with the USD Libor (London interbank offered rate), our expectations are that the US interest rate normalisation in June 2015 will see the Sibor moving on a higher trajectory in 2015.
"We expect the three- month SGD Sibor to move towards 1 per cent by end-2015," said UOB.
Should home loan borrowers worry? Some say the pace of the increase could be a concern but as long as the absolute interest rate remains low, the hike in monthly instalments should be manageable.
On a $100,0000 loan with a 20-year tenure, the monthly instalment would rise $11.45 to $484.85 if the three-month Sibor moves to 0.7 per cent for a home loan package based on three-month Sibor + 0.85 per cent, according to OCBC Bank.
Lui Su Kian, head of DBS Bank (Singapore) deposits and secured lending, said the best time to lock in an attractive set of fixed rates is during a low interest environment.
"Fixed rate packages continue to remain popular with both private property and Housing Board home owners, but there are also options to have both floating and fixed rates within the same programme," said Ms Lui.{C}

May not be good to long gold if you are looking for appreciation.
Market is risk on and USD is expected to remain firm.
Versus the SGD, i think USD would perform better.
Am looking for USDSGD to go towards 1.38 by year end.

SINGAPORE: A key interest rate that housing loans in Singapore are pegged to rose sharply for a second day, indicating home owners may face higher mortgage payments.
Bloomberg data showed the three-month Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (Sibor) was fixed at 0.62052 per cent at 11.30am on Tuesday (Jan 6), up from 0.57762 per cent on Monday.
Sibor is the rate at which banks lend to one another and is a widely used measure of the cost of funds. The three-month Sibor had been creeping up previously, rising from around 0.4 per cent in October to around 0.45 per cent at the end of last week.
Many housing loans are pegged to three-month Sibor. Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC), for example, is currently offering home loans at three-month Sibor plus 0.85 percentage points for the first three years, according to its website.
The lending rate is reviewed every three months.
Assuming mortgage rates in Singapore rise to 2 per cent from around 1.5 per cent currently, a home buyer with an outstanding loan of S$500,000 and 20 years remaining will need to pay around S$2,530 a month, up from S$2,410. Should the rate rise to 3 per cent, the monthly payment will increase to S$2,770.

higher sibor cld mean the bank cartel,,oops... association of banks are detecting more mortgage payment arrears, more property valuation declines & maybe more widespread mortgage defaults... before this was high end prop defaults, but now i wont b surprised if mid to low income also kena, especially those property going to or already TOP cannot find rental cover mortgage etc
 
flip side is this may signal the start of CM removals...

i have long warned of interest rates increases and i do not think CM will be removed , even if it is removed i do not think it will move the market.
 
It only allow foreign leeches facilitate their running away plans and potentially adversely affecting our banking system. But i might be wrong.
 
As for gold , i would not suggest trading them , i am more of a physical person , i person to buy gold physical. Worse come to worse i can use it as a pillow.
 
As for USD , based on what i read and research they are probably going to go through at least 5 years of asset appreciation.

There are many CMs. Some are useless ones.  
No big impact whether remove or not.....
Its clear no one wants to see a crash (except perhaps me and a few forumers here)
 
While the true price movement has probably been -10 to -15% over the last 18mths, its only reported as maybe -4 to -6%.  So if they make decisions base on these reports, i expect another -10 to -15% in real price reductions before any CM will even be considered for removal.
 
Woooohoooo, last checked, the price of a D9 unit i sold in mid 2013 is now asking at 15% cheaper or 2010 prices.....i think there's strong possibility for it to go another 10% down......

In a crash, the logic will be strong US treasuries.

Investor won't be so shallow one. Investors only think of making money but all signs are pointing the opposite direction.
 
In a higher interest rates environment the following will deter an investor:
 
1. Rental will drop and the difference (after deducting installment) might be too little an incentive for the investor to hold on to the property. Worse if he needs to pay up the difference.
 
2. Paper loss will also prompt the investor to cut loss (sell) sooner than later.
 
3. USD appreciating, US treasury rally will point to the US for more money making opportunities. Why hold on to a loss-making machine? Net results, sell SG properties to fund US investments.
 
All these have already started since QE3 was officially ended (even several months before). The order is just being reversed now. Two years ago a UOB banker at JGateway Condo Showflat told me interest rates will never rise for the next 5 years. Even if so it will still be less than 2%. And he calculated my projected monthly installment using 2.5% as the benchmark interest rate. I LOL at the young man.

10% 20% blah blah blah , why bother , if property prices can jack up 100% over the past 6 years i am not surprised if it can drop back to where it is prior to the casino rumor. Reason why ? China players are drying up due to restrictions , not much new investments coming up and jurong is overcrowded with shopping malls and hardly any establishment to sustain it. 
 
In a radius of 5 km there are 5 shopping malls , IMM , big box , jcube , jem , westgate so how much rental are you going to charge and how are the businesses going to sustain ?? Just hope that the hospital will bring you more biz? Do remember people are going to hospitals to visit their sick love ones , not come to a shopping and shop for grocery , seriously i don't know what is going on through their thick skulls. While pungol is overcrowded with HDBs with nothing to support it with the nearest mega mall being at serangoon. Best township design. Worse , no cars , all squeeze one lan jiao mrt all the way to jurong.
 
I am not sure , maybe there going to be big things going on there in jurong, maybe they are redirecting the banks over there and all other businesses. I do forsee alot of new stuff in jurong , hope it is good to go in the near future.
 
A suggestion to the leaders , please plan ahead and try to create jobs before you think of how to sqeeze rental yields out of people. No job creating , no technological advance no entrepreneurship , you guys are just getting everything wrong. Economic growth comes from SMEs creation , not building giant blocks of concrete and stiffing all the SMEs out of the picture.
 
3 things i would like to highlight to the freaking idoit on top.
 
1. The "can do" generation is getting old , now it is filled with the strawberry generation which has not tasted poverty. Clowns are picking and choosing jobs.
 
2. Rentals and cost of business are ridiculously high , how is it sustainable for SME and the less educated to even survive to support the basic fabric of the economy? Ask yourself , with goods vehicles at such high prices and ERPs everywhere , are the jams actually better? The problem is it isn't , what the garmen is doing is merely forcing the bussiness owners to transfer of cost of transport to the end users and making their own margins thinner.
 
3. Absolutely ZERO technological breakthrough , how are we going to evolve to the next stage when our young and being taught of meeting grades and being absolutely concerned with grades and grades alone as seen in the strawberry gen. Are kids even allow to drop out and create something be it , food , drinks or something they absolutely like . One example of zero breakthrough , what  i see now is the popup of countless cafes with similar ideas selling the SAME food , how boring is that? The young nowadays other than monkey see monkey do cannot think of other stuff to do.

To me prices of properties are absolutely going to drop and i would think it should drop to prices where SMEs are able to sustain and make a good living. Else i don't see any future in Singapore.
 
Our neighbors are picking up the slack we singaporean let go, our young are no longer hungry and no longer have the can do mindset and unless this is changed , what i forsee is a end of the road for singapore , reason as below
 
1. Shipping technologies are getting better and ports can be easily built everywhere , our main business and competitive advantage is slowly evaporating.
 
2. Oil products will never be able to sustain us forever , it is not a labor intensive industry and many of our young are not willing to do a hardship job.
 
3. Hot money flowing out , if anyone notice , there are no longer any noticeable IPOs in sg , even MAN U ipo elsewhere  , this was a clear sign that sg was going to decline , that's what prompt me to do a deep research on the economy.
 
4. High property prices and rental and low job creations. Foreign labors reliance is never the way to sustain a business over the long run , locals needs to be paid a sustainable income for the local economy to thrive and population to grow. An over prices property would do the opposite , people are being forced to work longer hours as a lower wage to merely sustain themselves thus leading to a lower rate of birth.
 
5. Emphasis on education system and a self serving garment is never the way to bring the country forward , people nowadays are no longer willing to make mistakes or take the risk , just look at the social media , just a small thing , stomp can make it a big hooha. 
 
6. Lesser and lesser outreach to the world and self enclosure , as our children gets more and more mono language competent  , how is it possible to trash it out with foreigners which are hungry and more willing to learn a new language to blend in? My parents can speak more than 5 languages and my grandmother which has passed learnt how to speak japanese during the japanese occupation. Kids nowadays think they can merely survive with english alone , many can't even speak mandarin properly less to say dialect or any other languages.

Innovation.... Intellectual capital is deemed as the new force. Creating and materialising something that people wants and generating business out of it. Gov has been pouring money into such initiative but so far, dun think the result is anything to shout about. A lot of hype in papers but dig further in, its just empty shells. It prob will require a revolutionary change of mind set to see results but how many of the current or next generation will do that? Even the current leaders will just stick to the same old formula for gdp growth or follow other so called success model else where. However, every case, every country is different. The basic foundation, culture and mind set needs to be change first before anything else.

but what if the buyer cannot even afford $2500 because cannot let out the unit? ho say liao ...
 

 
then he better lelong and rent out at 1500... if cannot then 1000.. if still cannot i am sure someone will rent it for 500  

 
If a table wiper can be as educated as yourself, why can't the kopitiam uncle be educated?
 
These days, Kopitiams are worth a lot of money so the uncle could be a very rich man.

 
you'd be surprised many kopitiam uncle or even taxi drivers are proud owners of BKK or MY condos. Hence they have to keep up with news on interest rates as it affects their interest payments too!
To me prices of properties are absolutely going to drop and i would think it should drop to prices where SMEs are able to sustain and make a good living. Else i don't see any future in Singapore.
 
Yes for the good of the nation, real estate prices have to drop.. by at least 30% from current values. 50% would be better.
 
But can it? and will govt allow it?
 
landlords will only strive to keep values and rental high. If it ever drops, it will be due to external forces, and not the goodness of the govt.
 
 
Landlords in SG:
 
residential - 80% controlled by HDB. significant part of remaining 20% by capitaland/ keppel land/ and friends
 
office - much of it also chenghu in REITS. higher value also means higher management fee on the AUM
 
retail - same as above
 
industrial - even worse than above as JTC/ Mapletree & Ascendas prob controls 90% of investment grade industrial property in SG

Not for the many which leveraged themselves to the hilt , I recalled if i am not wrong , personal bankruptcy cases also rose from 1,748 in 2012 to 1,992 last year, a 14 per cent increase in one year and i am not surprised it is going to increase in 2014 and even worse in the year of 2014.
 
There are many which will tell me that the NPL and shit implies that Singaporeans are still in good positions but I am not so sure .
 
The number of registered agents in Singapore grew to 31,040 as at 1 January 2013, up from 30,577 on 1 Jan 2012  , probably more dropped out during the year of 2014.
 
So if the property market is that good why are there peope leaving and more likely than not , there might be many which can't find employment after. It doesn't really reflect well looking forward.

 
then he better lelong and rent out at 1500... if cannot then 1000.. if still cannot i am sure someone will rent it for 500

Dude why not , the problem is it is not yet til signs of desperation , the land lords are unlikely to budge as most land lords are cash rich.

Some folks always say that market has gone up 100% what is 20% drop?
 
Let me highlight mathematically, drops are always bigger when percntages get converted to absolutes.
 
Eg. Price at start was 100  and growth was 100%. price now would be 200.   However, a 20% drop from 200 is not 20 but 40.  For this example, a 50% drop wiped out the 100% gain.
 
Therefore for every percentage that an asset rises, it takes a lower percentage drop to bring it back to the original position.  
 
Do take note ah, dont say i didnt say.

Where is the joker which tells me that Singapore debt is properly managed via a lan jiao report reporting NPL ratio? So debt won't affect local banks ?? Come leh explain to me why is this happening ??
 
Where is lightbringer the opera singer??
 
Sorry spring some shit stirring but target not you.
 
All banks have a comprehensive reporting to be done monthly to MAS and this includes all sorts of numbers from outstanding loans, deposits, bad debts etc.The banks report this meticulously and carefully cos the penalty for incorrect reporting can be a substantial fine to even suspension of license.There have been cases in the past of banks being caught by MAS for wrong doing like round tripping of S$ etc so our Central Bank is known for being a good policeman for our financial system and we are known worldwide to have a robust system in place.

Just a thought which I am thinking out loud if I am a foreigner or foriegn entity , would I have any problems if I already made a pile the past few years in cash and now I have a couple of properties which I think might lose me money ., should I just bail out and take the cash I have and move it elsewhere before it crashes and default on the other properties which I got caught in , anyway the most I don't go back to that small island which has nothing , they used to have a pretty nice beach at east coast and chose to let it rot now.
 
Well no issues ,I made my piles time to move on ,good bye?

 
Whatever that's is reported is just the tip of the ice berg.

To me prices of properties are absolutely going to drop and i would think it should drop to prices where SMEs are able to sustain and make a good living. Else i don't see any future in Singapore.
 
Our neighbors are picking up the slack we singaporean let go, our young are no longer hungry and no longer have the can do mindset and unless this is changed , what i forsee is a end of the road for singapore , reason as below
 
1. Shipping technologies are getting better and ports can be easily built everywhere , our main business and competitive advantage is slowly evaporating.
 
2. Oil products will never be able to sustain us forever , it is not a labor intensive industry and many of our young are not willing to do a hardship job.
 
3. Hot money flowing out , if anyone notice , there are no longer any noticeable IPOs in sg , even MAN U ipo elsewhere  , this was a clear sign that sg was going to decline , that's what prompt me to do a deep research on the economy.
 
4. High property prices and rental and low job creations. Foreign labors reliance is never the way to sustain a business over the long run , locals needs to be paid a sustainable income for the local economy to thrive and population to grow. An over prices property would do the opposite , people are being forced to work longer hours as a lower wage to merely sustain themselves thus leading to a lower rate of birth.
 
5. Emphasis on education system and a self serving garment is never the way to bring the country forward , people nowadays are no longer willing to make mistakes or take the risk , just look at the social media , just a small thing , stomp can make it a big hooha. 
 
6. Lesser and lesser outreach to the world and self enclosure , as our children gets more and more mono language competent  , how is it possible to trash it out with foreigners which are hungry and more willing to learn a new language to blend in? My parents can speak more than 5 languages and my grandmother which has passed learnt how to speak japanese during the japanese occupation. Kids nowadays think they can merely survive with english alone , many can't even speak mandarin properly less to say dialect or any other languages.

Referring to your point 4, I told my wife 2 years ago that when our current source of cheap labour no longer want to come here anymore, what's next? Look for cheap labour from Africa? Haha

There is no way they will reduce the cost of living to a reasonable level that is acceptable to common people because it needs to feed our self serving government and their "own circle of friends and associates".

The market is bigger than what you think it is. This leadership is no longer the same leadership which lead us to success. A leader which is afraid of making mistakes and admitting them is not a leader which will bring innovation and evolution.

According to UOB, one of the so-called buyers admitted to being paid $100,000 to act as a proxy.
LMC denies being part of any conspiracy to cause loss to UOB and will vigorously defend the claims made against it.

Considering that the local banks were quite enthusiastic to loan the max 80% based on the income levels, as I have personally encountered while trying to secure a property loan in 2011, the kiasi Malaysian Maybank was the only one who was not willing to loan the max 80% amount.
 
No surprise that the over-enthusiasm may have backfired in some cases.
 
OT: I think my loan rate of SIBOR + 0.7% flat for the entire tenure seems to be a good deal, don't think they offer this package these days. Live by the SIBOR, die by the SIBOR!

mkt weak, problems arise: UOB vs Lippo... fwah... 


"UOB alleges that sums ranging from $200,000 to $1.2 million were transferred between bank accounts of the "buyers" and several defendants.

This was to give the bank the impression that whoever was applying for a loan had at least $200,000 in their UOB accounts - one of the criteria for the loan to be granted."


Loophole spotted... hope all banks to take note and plug the loophone..
 
Lesson learn..
 
Don't just look how much $ in the bank account, also look at the transaction history of the account holder.

Ironically, those that took 90% loan for MY properties should be doing better than those who paid full cash - MYR down so their debt in SGD terms is also less.
 
Of course, both parties lose out on the value of their property.

When i was young , all the bussinessman uncles used to tell me LKY would be the world's richest man if he was a bussinessman , he is so sharp and shwerd that people are afraid of him. He is always ahead in thought based on my few impressions meeting him and he was around in his 70s , i  would wonder how strong he is when he was in his peak.
 
It takes bussiness acumen to make right strategic decisions and taking charge when things f**ked up , not duck from the responsiblity and try cover it.

Not many but got some lah
 
some people have some strange need to justify to the agent why they are buying.. maybe they want to appear clever
 
so i will warn them about the over supply and untested rental market etc 
 
and they will say don't worry, cannot rent then just use as holiday apartment lor
 
that's why sometimes it is quite easy being an agent. If client not keen to buy, no need to waste saliva convincing them
 
if they want to buy, even u tell them very risky they also will write you a cheque

Couple in their sixties with daughter downgrading from private to HDB, definitely have cash.Sell private already got cash.  Use some to buy HDb and some for the rest of their lives.
 
Whats the big deal, really? 
By 60s, most decent white collared employee would have likely a 7digit bank account after selling their property.  Average singapore household already has $700k in cash.
 
Next time you in your 60s will have also lah, dont worry.
 
In this case, the old couple doesnt want big commitment and prefers to leave life leisurely so just settle the bill.  Next time pass the flat to daughter without headaches.
 
Quite similar to my parents, the HDB is fully paid and will be passed to my unmarried sister if anything happens to them.

Haha , just things i observed , since i am on sabbatical after collecting a fat bonus ,i think i can give my opinion.
 
Probably some of the others in credit would notice , there is an increasing amount of default payments and more to come in the near future. I have warned of this since 2013 , but now i would think it is a good time to short the developer stocks.
 
Some of the richer guys here would probably receive a list from their banks on those default units. More shit to come.

Lucky the government put on brakes on loan curb , if not it will be a lot worst off now. I still feel that mainstream media should be more mindful of what is being published regarding the record breaking selling price if it is sold to buyer paying full cash instead of taking loan. The way the news is published is in such a way that it give public a false impression that the housing market is still good with the recent 900plus k sale of the pinnicle dexturn. In fact its not doing that well if buyer would to take loan.. So need to minus out cash rich people as market up or down do not affect as much as those taking huge loan.

When i was young , all the bussinessman uncles used to tell me LKY would be the world's richest man if he was a bussinessman , he is so sharp and shwerd that people are afraid of him. He is always ahead in thought based on my few impressions meeting him and he was around in his 70s , i  would wonder how strong he is when he was in his peak.
 
It takes bussiness acumen to make right strategic decisions and taking charge when things f**ked up , not duck from the responsiblity and try cover it. Most of the people know the ex aljunied grc lost money to lehman bros but how come they don' dig and publish it and yet bring out the deficients of the present group running one the moment it had problems.

 
Yes, LKY was very sharp and shrewd in his peak, but even then he also got snooked by the Chinese in the Suzhou Industrial Park saga. What more can we expect from other mere mortals? Learn and regurgitate from textbooks lah...

They didnt disappear lah..... Take a deep breath, i can smell chowtar prata, so nearby.

UOB lawsuit unlikely to impact developers

Market watchers believe it will be difficult to find out if the price of a unit sold has been inflated
[singapore] THE lawsuit filed by United Overseas Bank (UOB) against a Lippo Group subsidiary and seven other individuals has intrigued industry players over how the transacted prices of some residential units could be so substantially inflated. But many have deemed this a special case on its own facts.
 
The monthly developers' sales data collated by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) have started factoring in cash rebates, absorption of legal fees or stamp fees, furniture vouchers and rental guarantees in transacted prices since late 2013.
And while it is on a voluntary basis that developers submit their monthly sales information to URA since June 2007, it is generally understood that developers have been complying before the requirement becomes mandatory this year.
 
"When the Housing Developers (Control & Licensing) (Amendment) Act comes into effect in the first half of 2015, it will be mandatory for developers to submit to us the net prices of the units sold," said a URA spokeswoman. "We will then release these net prices on our website."
The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has since 2004 required homebuyers to declare any price discount, rebate or other benefit, including the reimbursement of any stamp duty or tax granted to the banks when seeking loans. The mortgage granted is based on net price.
But in the UOB-Lippo case, buyers of 38 units at Marina Collection in Sentosa had allegedly secured inflated home loans from the bank between late 2011 and July 2013 by failing to disclose substantial furniture vouchers amounting to 22-34 per cent discounts on the purchase price. Each condo at the 124-unit development costs an average of S$6 million.
UOB is suing Lippo Marina Collection and seven others for not informing the bank of these discounts, after loans for 37 of these units defaulted.
Will more banks start moving against developers too? Market watchers believe this is unlikely as it is difficult to find out whether the price of a unit sold is indeed inflated, except through the confession of the buyer, agent or developer.
"If there is no default and banks are still getting repayments, nothing will be unravelled," said SLP International executive director Nicholas Mak. "Why would you want to kill a chicken that is still laying eggs. As long as it is laying eggs every month, you will let it be."
Developers will still be watching closely the outcome of this court case and be more cautious when giving indirect discounts, perhaps requiring the buyer to sign documents stating that he or she is aware of the rules to declare such incentives when applying for loans, Mr Mak said.
In fact, this is already practised by many developers. One developer's general manager told BT that when the company offered rebates on the additional buyers' stamp duty in 2013, it made buyers sign a letter with a clause saying that the buyer has to declare this to the bank.
Instead of giving outright price cuts when sales are slow, some developers have sought to entice buyers with indirect discounts to avoid upsetting earlier buyers. Furniture vouchers or rebates would typically fall within S$20,000-S$50,000 for units costing between $1 million and $2 million.
 
While URA has asked developers to provide net prices of units sold, "it depends on whether developers are doing it or not", the general manager said. "Do banks want to sue developers for one or two units that could be inflated? Developers will argue that this is between them and the buyers."
But banks have become more stringent since the loans cap under the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) kicked in in June 2013, and it now works against borrowers to inflate their home purchase prices under the TDSR, property consultants say. Buyers are also more discerning now and prefer direct discounts.
Once developers are required by law to declare net prices, it will be difficult for any developer to hide behind those indirect discounts.
 
"Such practices (indirect discounts) are probably passï¿½ already," said Lim Yew Soon, managing director of EL Development, which will be launching Symphony Suites in Yishun in a month's time.
 
Denka Wee, head of business services at realty DWG, said that developers still need to sell their projects in the sluggish market and will have to come up with creative marketing events. "They will not adjust their marketing strategies because of this matter."

 	StanChart faces $4.4 billion commodities hit, may need to raise cash - analysts

Standard Chartered PLC
STAN.L
922.50p
+1.30+0.14%
08:35:20 BST



 
 
(Reuters) - Asia-focused bank Standard Chartered (STAN.L) could need $4.4 billion (2.9 billion pounds) of extra provisions to cover losses from commodities loans, potentially forcing it to raise billions of dollars from investors, analysts said on Monday.
Credit Suisse analysts said the losses could force Standard Chartered to raise $6.9 billion to improve its core capital ratio to 11 percent by the end of the year.
"We think the needed provisioning could be large enough to require further capital measures, such as further equity raisin, and/or dividend reductions," analyst Carla Antunes-Silva said in a note.
Standard Chartered's shares were down 2.3 percent at 923 pence by 1330 GMT, the weakest major European bank.
A jump in Standard Chartered's bad debts in the third quarter has prompted concern that it could face heavy losses from commodities loans after the fall in the price of oil andcommodities.
Credit Suisse's estimate was based on an "adverse" scenario that would see the bank need $4.4 billion to maintain its capital ratio, based on a potential $2.6 billion of pretax provisioning for commodities loans that sour and a higher risk-weighting on the loans.
It said the bank could announce a rights issue or cut the dividend at its 2014 results, due on March 4.
Standard Chartered declined to comment.
"We believe the last two years of de-rating have been driven largely by weaker revenue and that the asset quality deterioration leg is now setting in," said Credit Suisse, maintaining its "underperform" rating on the stock.
Analysts at JPMorgan and Jefferies also cut their target prices on the stock on Monday, saying that credit quality could deteriorate.
Standard Chartered CEO Peter Sands is under pressure after a troubled two years in which profits have fallen, halting a decade of record earnings. Some investors have said that Sands should go or the bank should set out succession plans.
Sands last week announced plans to close the bulk of the bank's equities business and axe 4,000 jobs in retail banking as part of a turnaround plan to cut costs and sharpen its focus.
The London-based bank issued three profit warnings last year and saw its shares tumble 29 percent.
Credit Suisse said that its analysis was based on default probabilities across Asian energy, metals and mining companies and an assessment of Standard Chartered's commodities portfolio.

Yishun site attracts $185.09m top bid
 

Jan 14, 2015
 

 
 

A mixed commercial and residential site at Yishun Avenue 4 attracted a total of five bids after the tender closed on Tuesday, revealed the HDB.
Launched for sale last November, the 9,759.80 sqm site has a maximum gross floor area (GFA) of 27,327.44 sqm and plot ratio of 2.8.
The top bid of $185.09 million was submitted by Northern Resi and Northern Retail. This translates to a psm price of about $6,773 on the GFA.
KBD Ventures and Changi Properties offered the second highest bid of $181.6 million, while the lowest bid of $94.5 million came from KSH Land Development.
CBRE Research Head Desmond Sim said given the current market conditions, the price bids remained subdued.
“Bids for this Yishun site reflect some level of caution as there are private residential projects in the North yet to be launched. The bidders would have factored these considerations before determining their overall bid price,” he explained.
According to the housing board, the 99-year leasehold plot could yield 180 housing units.
A decision on the award of the tender will be made after the bids have been evaluated.
Meanwhile, the first half of 2015 will likely see nine confirmed sites launched for sale. “With that in mind, the market should see a fair number of bidders for land sales in 2015 given that the inventories of some developers are running low,” noted Sim.

especially this guy 
http://www.stproperty.sg/articles-property/singapore-property-news/no-oversupply-in-property-market-consultant/a/140835
 
Enough home supply for up to 2030
 
i guess the main point is here ... so we need to meet 6.9M population by 2017 to fill up the vacancies?
or the vacancies is left vacant for 13 years until 2030? 
 
Singapore’s population was about 5.4 million at the end of last June. Taken together, it means that if we simply allowed the current residential projects in the pipeline to be completed, we can already accommodate a population of 6.7 million. And if we take into account the current vacancy of 23,375 private residential and EC units (as at end-September last year), we can just about accommodate the 6.9 million planned for 2030.

http://www.stproperty.sg/articles-property/singapore-property-news/no-oversupply-in-property-market-consultant/a/140835
 
Enough home supply for up to 2030
 
i guess the main point is here ... so we need to meet 6.9M population by 2017 to fill up the vacancies?
or the vacancies is left vacant for 13 years until 2030? 
 

 
 
perfect justification for PAP to bring in more ppl

Sorry I am less incline to use TA to measure prices as it is not inflation and fundamental adjusted. Though history do repeats itself but to me I don't judge based on this.
 
To me , properties prices is subject to cashflow and market flows more than charts . More often than not , under normal circumstances they are just a delayed action that reflect the economic scenario. But in SG it is slightly different this time round , it is more of hot money flowing out and everyone is no longer buying the dream Singapore is selling.
 
As for the justification , so what , by increasing the population by increasing trash here would increase the productivity?? Sorry , I don't think it works this way.

There's sufficient housing to go around.
 
http://www.todayonline.com/business/property/enough-home-supply-2030?singlepage=true
 
Many property market participants remain in denial about the housing oversupply situation, with investors and real estate agents hoping that the outlook will improve while they ignore the growing difficulties in securing tenants amid stiff competition among landlords.
BY KU SWEE YONG -
JANUARY 16

Many property market participants remain in denial about the housing oversupply situation, with investors and real estate agents hoping that the outlook will improve while they ignore the growing difficulties in securing tenants amid stiff competition among landlords.
It should be clear by now that the residential property segment is heavily oversupplied.
Vacancies of private homes at 7.1 per cent equate to more than 21,000 empty units at the end of last September, Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) data showed. Meanwhile, the stock of vacant Executive Condominiums (ECs) rose sharply to 2,375 units, or 16.2 per cent, at the end of September from 1,634 units, or 12.2 per cent at the end of June. And more homes are being built, putting further pressure on the market. We can expect a total residential supply of 150,689 units within three years and possibly another 35,000 units in 2018.
Table 1 shows the expected completion of new residential units — private, EC as well as HDB — from this year to 2017. The figures are compiled from projects currently under way and in various stages of completion, starting from land sales and HDB’s Build-To-Order (BTO) launches. Given that the pace of construction is usually ahead of developers’ planned schedules, we can expect the large supply to come into the market earlier.
Those who deny there is an oversupply of homes point to the Population White Paper published in January 2013 that outlined Singapore’s plans to allow for the population to increase to 6.9 million by 2030. In the same paper, it was stated that “sufficient land has been set aside for an additional 700,000 homes from today, and more in the longer term if there is a need”.
This implies that over the 17-year period from 2013 to 2030, we can expect population growth of 94,000 and an increase of 41,000 residential units per year on average. So those hopeful investors and property agents hold the opinion that while there may be some oversupply in the next few years, the excess supply will be small.
In my opinion, the forecast number of housing units is overestimated — and by a large margin. An increase of 94,000 in the population per year does not require an increase of 41,000 housing units, or about 2.3 persons per residential unit, because:
1. New population growth in the categories of “Dependants of Citizens/PRs/Work Pass Holders”, “Work Permit Holders” and “Foreign Domestic Workers” (which together take up 74 per cent of our non-resident population) does not take up significant additional housing units as the majority have their accommodation provided for by their employers at home or in workers’ dormitories;
2. New foreign students in Singapore (accounting for 6 per cent of non-residents) often choose to stay in hostels.
Furthermore, if we look back to the period with the highest population growth and look at the increase in the total number of homes, we will realise that the 700,000 additional housing units is grossly overestimated.
During the last decade, Singapore’s population growth averaged 130,000 per year, with the peak increase of 251,000 in 2008 (see Table 2). We managed to accommodate 1.3 million more people with an additional 151,475 residential units — or about one additional housing unit per 8.6 new persons in Singapore. This means that the 150,689 units that are expected to be completed from now to 2017 can accommodate another 1.3 million population growth.
Singapore’s population was about 5.4 million at the end of last June. Taken together, it means that if we simply allowed the current residential projects in the pipeline to be completed, we can already accommodate a population of 6.7 million. And if we take into account the current vacancy of 23,375 private residential and EC units (as at end-September last year), we can just about accommodate the 6.9 million planned for 2030.

 Rental revision not 10%; no renovation cost deal

20 Jan5:50 AM


I REFER to the Bloomberg article "S'pore empty homes may climb to highest since 1998" (BT, Jan 19).
I am Sam King's landlord, and I can confirm that the rental revision was 3.75 per cent lower, not 10 per cent as the article stated, and that I have not agreed to "split some renovation costs, and provide new curtains and lights".
While I am sure that your readers are well aware of the softness in Singapore residential rents, I am equally sure that they would appreciate the correct information.

Singapore
SAM King had a pleasant surprise when the lease on his Singapore apartment came up for renewal late last year. For the first time in six years, Mr King was able to negotiate a lower rent with his landlord.
"It has turned into a tenant's market," said the 29-year-old sales director at an aviation services company, who got a 10 per cent reduction in the rent on his two-bedroom penthouse in the east of Singapore. His landlord also agreed to split some renovation costs, and provide new curtains and lights.
As Singapore's property market cools following five years of price gains, the number of empty apartments is on the rise, putting pressure on some landlords and giving the upper hand to tenants like Mr King who are renegotiating their leases. Vacancy rates for private residential homes rose to 7.1 per cent during the quarter ended Sept 30, up from a low of 4.6 per cent in March 2010 and the highest since March 2006, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority showed.

SAM King had a pleasant surprise when the lease on his Singapore apartment came up for renewal late last year. For the first time in six years, Mr King was able to negotiate a lower rent with his landlord.
 
"It has turned into a tenant's market," said the 29-year-old sales director at an aviation services company, who got a 10 per cent reduction in the rent on his two-bedroom penthouse in the east of Singapore. His landlord also agreed to split some renovation costs, and provide new curtains and lights.
 
As Singapore's property market cools following five years of price gains, the number of empty apartments is on the rise, putting pressure on some landlords and giving the upper hand to tenants like Mr King who are renegotiating their leases. Vacancy rates for private residential homes rose to 7.1 per cent during the quarter ended Sept 30, up from a low of 4.6 per cent in March 2010 and the highest since March 2006, data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority showed. Some landlords, facing tighter lending curbs and a more competitive rental market, have defaulted on their mortgages, leading to a fivefold jump in the number of properties put up for auction by the banks. A total of 159 apartments or houses were auctioned last year, up from 32 in 2013, according to auction data from real estate broker Colliers International.
 
With fewer expatriates coming to live in Singapore due to controls on immigration, and a large number of apartments set to be completed in the next two years, the vacancy rate could rise further in 2015, bringing rents down even more.
 
"We may hit almost 10 per cent by end of 2015 as completions are coming faster than the time now taken to find a tenant," said Alan Cheong, a Singapore-based director at broker Savills plc. Even in the depths of the Asian crisis of 1998, when Singapore property prices plunged 34 per cent, apartment vacancies topped out at 9.7 per cent, Mr Cheong added.
 
More defaults are also probable, though for the moment it's only a small proportion of landlords who are facing difficulties with their mortgages. Less than 0.5 per cent of all mortgages were in default, according to the Monetary Authority of Singapore's latest financial stability report, published in December. Those in arrears made up less than one per cent of mortgages.
 
Landlords with multiple properties are most exposed to the softening rental market. With resale prices falling as well, they often can't recoup the price they paid for properties they are unable to rent out.
 
"The cooling measures have affected homeowners' ability to sell," said Sharon Lee, director and head of auction at the broker Knight Frank Singapore. "The current large supply of homes available for rent has also caused rental rates to decline and it could have affected some buyers' ability to refinance or service their loans."
 
Singapore's home prices fell 4 per cent in 2014, the first year-on-year decline since 2008. The government in 2013 added to its five-year campaign to rein in property values with some of the strictest measures, including capping total debt repayments at 60 per cent of a borrower's income.
 
Meanwhile, more restrictive policies on hiring expatriates have curbed demand for home rentals at a time when the supply of new apartments is on the rise, said Ong Teck Hui, the national director of research at broker Jones Lang LaSalle.
 
More than 20,000 new private homes will come onto the market in 2015 and again in 2016, up from about 17,911 in 2014, according to the Urban Redevelopment Authority.
 
The government has clamped down on expatriate hiring after losing votes on the immigration issue in the last election in 2011.
 
The number of employment passes issued in the first half of 2014 rose only 0.9 per cent to 176,600. That compares with a more than 20 per cent jump in such passes in each of the two years to 2011, data from the Ministry of Manpower showed. Passes issued fell 0.9 per cent in 2012 and rose 0.7 per cent in 2013.
 
Prime residential rents could fall another 10 per cent this year, after a similar drop in 2014, Mr Ong added.

I think this reporter has his numbers all wrong. Article says Sam King is 29 years old.
 
If you look at his LinkedIn page, https://sg.linkedin.com/pub/sam-king/14/6a1/936, he has almost 16 years of work experience.
 
A fresh uni grad from the UK would be around 23, making him 39 years old now. Best to take this article's figures with a pinch of salt. Looks like a very poor job of journalism here

Rising prices for housing because of cheap loan is good ? Think again. Again lucky government step brakes in 2012, if not I cannot open my eyes and see the consequences of what the banks will do for the 3 year period between 2012 to 2015 with them reckless lending to the consumer. Again does bank learnt the lesson in 2007/2008 financial crisis? Look at this article, I think only DBS at least got some sense in their head, but look at OCBC.

Housing demand unlikely to decline significantly: experts
 

Feb 3, 2015
 
 
Some consultants believe the rising interest rates will not significantly affect the ability of homebuyers to service monthly mortgages.
“Rising mortgage costs will reduce housing demand but the decline is not expected to be significant,” said Colliers International’s Deputy Managing Director Grace Ng. This is because “interest rates are expected to remain low given that the US economy has yet to see a full recovery and Europe has just announced a series of stimulus.”
 
And with the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) in place, banks have to factor in a higher interest rate of 3.5 percent when computing the loan eligibility of buyers, she added.
 
Owners who are holding multiple units or have over-committed to high loan quantums may face further “cash crunch”, said Ng. Colliers estimates around 78,402 units are set to be completed by 2018, of which 20,824 units are expected to be completed this year.
“If for a prolonged period, these property owners are not able to rent out their properties and service their mortgage loans, the market could see more mortgagee sales this year,” she added. The number of mortgagee sale listings is expected to increase from 160 last year to 200 this year.
 
For investors who can manage their cashflow, Ng believes they may be better off renting the property out even at lower rent in order that may have some income to pay for their monthly mortgage bills, than selling their units at lower prices.
 
For owner-occupiers, Ng believes it is the right time to commit to their preferred property. She noted a further five to eight percent slide in private home prices and a 10 percent drop in luxury home prices this year may offer a good opportunity for homebuyers.

Price is to be more "competitive" ?
 
so after dropping for a whole year, a new development without balcony, and facing yishun industrial buildings is priced at above $1,000 psf
 
and yishun condo opposite MRT is priced at $1,400 psf
 
very low indeed
 
 
 
Analysts expect new home prices to be more competitive
 

Feb 11, 2015
 
 
New private home units are expected to be competitively priced as developers prepare to roll out new residential projects amid challenging market conditions, according to analysts media reports.
Real estate agency PropNex Realty said past transactions indicated prices of new homes moderated by 10 to 12 percent on average over the past year.
 
Notably, prices of new units in the suburban areas as at end-2014 range between $1,000 psf for developments located further away from MRT station, and $1,400 psf for well-located projects, said PropNex.
 
The range stands between $1,400 and $1,900 for units located within the city fringe and from $1,900 to $2,400 for those in the Core Central Region (CCR).
 
El Development launched Symphony Suites at Yishun over the weekend.
 
“In order to keep units affordable, we have done away with large units, we have no balconies, no personal enclosed space, no roof terraces and no penthouses. We have tried to keep the layout of our units optimised,” said Lim Yew Soon, managing director at EL Development.
 
The 660-unit development saw 61 units snapped up at an average price of over $1,000 psf.
 
Another upcoming project is the Sims Urban Oasis at Sims Drive by GuocoLand. Market watchers expect units at this development to be priced from $1,300 to over $1,400 psf. They also expect Frasers Centrepoint’s North Park Residences in Yishun Central to have about the same price.
 
In recent years, sales of new homes slowed down after the government introduced a slew of property cooling measures and loan curbs.
Notably, new home sales plunged by over 50 percent year-on-year to more than 7,000 units in 2014. The drop in sales affected how new homes are being priced today.
 
“What the buyers can expect is this – the price will be relatively attractive because today, buyers are price sensitive, developers are also relatively anxious in many of the launches to have that momentum,” said PropNex CEO Mohamed Ismail Gafoor.

Did URA remove the free 10% GFA for balconies?
 
Otherwise isn't it just extremely stupid not to have balconies? I would think that the additional cost of constructing a balcony would be extremely low compared to the price of the flat.

yes, cost is low, and it is free hence developers all max out balcony, living room, MBR all have
 
i don't think the bonus balcony has been removed, there could be some revision to the policy though
 
my guess why they opt to leave out the balcony is to market it as the cheapest condo in SG
 
the units are around 700+ sqft for 3 bedder and cost under 900k. if they add in the balcony, quantum will exceed 900k? 

nabei ... really no $1000psf no talk for ulu condo ...

Buy more , buy more !! Take more risk , put your fortune on the line. Listen to housing agents and part your money to their comm  !!
 
I bought one of my condos at balestier at 300+psf in 2003 , historical high 1k+ psf , so ask yourself why should one pay such amounts in yishun ?? You mean yishun nearer to orchard or town than balestier which is 5~10 mins drive to both CTE and PIE?
 
On top of that 99 years vs a freehold ?

By today, if people think that launch price is real transacted price, i am sorry to say that these people are STUPID.
 
By today, if investors (no real demand) still think they can make big bucks in a short time, i am sorry to say they are STUPID.

most of those who buy are not investors.. it';s real occupiers who need a house
 
many ppl getting married and many ppl relocating to SG hor
 
those who bought during the lehman crash in 2009 were called stupid cos the market was expected to tank
 
those who bought in 2011 also labelled as stupid cos everyone knows that interest rates will soar soon and market will tank
 
i would guess these stupid people don't feel so foolish today
 
And i would soon be labelled stupid very soon cos i am also on the lookout to buy !

Good for you , future is a dirty word . Some time back , people are telling me to buy sentosa as it is a premium lifestyle residence and will float to the sky in the "future" due the limited units.
 
Some time later in the future those which "bought" suffered millions in losses and some close 40% paper losses. Dude , back up your words with some ERA plans stating the "future" and that shopping centres like "paragon" and the likes would be moving out to places like yishun before telling me about the future.
 
Before you tell others to buy , please show me that you will also bought. No point telling others to buy and you don't jump in. It is like telling other to drink poison because it is good for you and you only talk but don't drink it yourself. Else it is just sale speech which i think is against forum rules.

Don't misled people la , first i compared balestier to yishun , you gave me to bulls**t of the "future" the new orchard will soon be at yishun/ woodlands .
 
When is that ? 10 years time? No timeline nothing. Wow , URA draft plans , and yishun ion called northpark city wow!! Last heard , there is also about 4 shopping centres in jurong east mrt and yet , it takes years before it can become a CBD. What kind of crap are you talking about the future which isn't even in 10 years. I don't even see any buildings neither construction site.
 
Are you telling me because of your claims , the uber rich from sentosa and bukit timah are made to move upwards in order to be near to the "new" orchard??
 
I don't subscribe to anything i do what i say and i say what i do. Thats all. I don't tell people about the "future plans" and but nothing to support those claims.

Well , from the prices of what i sold to whatever prices now, i believe there is at least a 10% drop , which meant for every 1 mio i have in property i would have suffered a loss of 100k if i held it til now. The only property i held are those which are fetching me <7% rental yield.
 
I don't shift goal post , you are. First you claim about what is coming in the future now you claim you aren't fortune teller?

if yishun is not prime, then please explain why it is 1,400 psf and 99yrs
 
whereas your balestier FH at the historical high only 1000+ psf?  
 
u clearly do not appreciate what is prime and subprime

Thats why i said , go buy lor , buy more. Yishun is prime. By the way , show me to prove you bought. Else , same rules applies.
 
I didn't know 1400 isn't 1k+ , i must have failed math.
 
By the way , prices of condos in yishun range the same as those of balestier , thats was why i used it as reference.
 
The volatility of prices are clearer in this context where prices went as low as 400-500per psf back in 2003 as well. So if you think 1.4k is sustainable , it is your choice.
 
I have already stated my case to you, if you think otherwise , it is your opinion. I based mine on my own research , it isn't something i will buy at current prices. IF you wish to tell others that it is a good buy , please buy one yourself. Thats all. It is not convincing when people give all those shit and yet when asked if they committed , they say they are "looking" out.

the smart investors are saving bullets for the 1400 psf at northpark.. 
 
maybe if EL development hired me, i can help move more than the 61 units for them

Dude go check the prices of THE INTERWEAVE which was completed last year before you talk about 1.4k is damn prime. Wow , employ you will move more than 61 units , so clever.  The other older ones , are pretty dated and ranged around 1k+ but they were sold at prices in the region 300~500 psf which represents a 200% return. For your yishun "prime" , it is at its highest prices in the area and it is only 1.4k and you call it prime? To me it is a risk given a potential higher interest rate and dropping rental yields.
 
Go do your homework before you bark at me. Everything need to spoonfeed. Haiz , joker. What is new? Hahahaha aiyo , this forum is damn funny , filled with plenty which shoot themselves in the leg from time to time.

Right , everything you say one. First you say property prices stablized and moving up , next claim he is no fortune teller , now tell me buy now sure lose money and still claims his 1.4k condo is prime when prices compared loses to the ones of 1.7k else where. Claims we are talking about places in yishun and claims he invest in prime , yet 1.4k is prime , 1.7k isn't prime and confirm lose money. WOW , not fortune teller but can tell me sure lose money but his property at yishun selling at 1.4k at a premium above the neighbouring condos wil not lose money. ?!?!

For the records i was looking to buy in 2009 and concluded sale early 2010
Sold at prime segment market peak in 2013.
 
So i am really not sure who you talking about
 
The point is you talk so much, what did you do?
Only prata people to buy regardless of market
And prata people to sell regardless of market
 
Therefore dont talk so loud.

Liao liao, forget the fight.
this year market anticipate more retrenchment and businesses may experience slowdown.
My bonus last year still can buy secondhand datejust. This year can only buy secondhand lady datejust.
 
How to buy another few properties with high stamp duty, high prop tax, high mcst fees, higher interest, lower rents
 
Finished already.
 
Now considering to sell my cheap car to buy a cheaper one.
Sell wife's car and ask her to take bus wth the kids.
 
Starting to sell Rolex too.
Oysterdate 115210 with black dial for sale at $4288 with box and warranty card.
 
😢😣😞😭😥😫😩

 
 
if most people's bonuses are affected like yours, then no need high stamp duty, all can go back to 3%
 
However ABSD is still there cos many people still loaded with cash, dunno what to do
 
hence i suspect you are just downplaying everything as usual.. bonus gao gao still come and say falling... wanna sell car

I find this argument more reasonable. If ABSD is to ensure affordable housing for Singaporeans, there is no need to have it for properties costing above 5m.
 
Those rich people can easily fend for themselves.

Wah lau eh......
 
If truly want to fine tune CM.
Govt should apply ABSD to beyond two properties per married couple and not per single ownership.
 
This means that a married couple can jointly own two properties without AbSD.  
 
Instead of husband owns one and wife owns one.
 
At the end of the day it is still two properties max for two people except one creates a social rift and much possibly ugly endings.

Its like if i ask you to give me just 1% of your annual salary every month.  
You may think that you are only giving me 1% of your annual salary in a year but actually you are giving me 12% of your annual salary becos you give me 1% every month.  So the effective rate which you pay me is actually no less than 12% of your annual salary. 
 
Car delaers and ah long do this shit all the time.  So when you borrow at 2%, it could easily be 5% effctively.......

but comm has gone up 200%-500%

Healthy demand for Kingsford Waterbay units
 

Mar 9, 2015
 
 
A new mixed-use development at Upper Serangoon View has seen keen interest from buyers, selling 40 percent or 140 of the 320 units launched over the weekend, media reports said.
 
Prices for condominium units at Kingsford Waterbay range between $1,050 and $1,180 psf.
 
The 1,165-unit project by Kingsford Development also features six strata terraces, two strata semi-detached homes, its own childcare centre and six retail units.
 
The Chinese developer reportedly sold two strata semi-Ds, one strata terrace and six retail spaces. Prices for the shops, which range from 431 to 452 sq ft, stood at $2,700 psf.
 
Consultants noted that it was “quite good” that Kingsford Development was able to achieve three-digit sales within a day (on Saturday) amid the lacklustre property market. Some attributed the healthy response to attractive agent commissions, while R’ST Research Director Ong Kah Seng said it was due to the attractive pricing.
 
 

 

WOW, high end condo still got legs to run??? 
 
 
Apartments at Marina Bay condo fetch above $3,000 psf
 

Mar 9, 2015
 
 
The ultra posh Marina Bay Residences located in Singapore’s new downtown core has made headlines after three large apartments on high floors transacted recently over the $3,000 psf mark, media reports said.

and the effective rate is even higher? 
 

 
ppty loans are capital-reducing, so the nominal rate = effective rate.
 
if paying instalments for a mid/long term non-capital reducing loan, that's where the advertised (nominal) rate and the effective rate (EIR) have a huge gap, typically the EIR is double the nominal. Car loans fall into this category. IIRC, the longer the loan, the bigger the spread.

made $198K from selling hdb ... huat ah!
opps ... the huatness is short-lived
sell hdb to buy a weekend car + rent a private apartment ... 
even if the investment is not a scam ... this is not a smart move
https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/198-000-flat-proceeds-gone-two-years-family-033024065--sector.html
 
The mother of four used the $198,000 sales proceeds to buy a weekend car and rent a private apartment.
 
The family had spent all the sales proceeds in less than two years from the time they sold the flat.Thereafter, Madam A, along with her husband and eldest son, resorted to sleeping on the beach or void decks because they could no longer afford to rent or buy another flat on the open market. The younger children lived separately with different relatives.

what's wrong to remove income ceiling for bto as long as
 
1. no grant for income > $10k (current ceiling)
 
2. one time only
 
3. not applicable to 2-3 rooms flat which are targeted lower income (the problem is lower income also want to buy 4 room flat thinking to sell after mop)
 
4. stop selling the smoke  of hdb heavily subsidy. land cost is left to right pocket. grant is knock off from market price not really hard cash outflow

Think they have drift away from their origin. HDB was set up to make sure everyone can have a place. Now they strip the right off certain group of Singaporean.

I would also allow private property owners who are still eligible to buy new HDB, to do so if they meet the income ceiling but they will have to sell away their property and you can't rent out the new HDB as well.  
The 2 bites at the cherry rule should be the fundamental coz there are private property owners who need to downgrade for various reasons and the high cost of a resale HDB means they will not have much left after renovation etc if they get resale. Don't have the idea that all private property owners are well off and anyway that's the basic origin of HDB as you have rightfully pointed out, to house all Singaporeans who are eligible.
 
The current rule of waiting 30months after you get rid of the private property is really restrictive as where will these people stay meanwhile?

to be honest, I really cannot understand the rationale a hdb owner can buy private property but not the other way. worse still, these hdb owner actually  stay in private property and rent out whole hdb unit.

asset enhancement scheme bro ...
so that hdb is supported at an artificial value no $500k no talk
need owner to push hdb and private property price
with hdb no $500k no talk ... all private property has a support level ...
EC = 30% premium of hdb, mickey mouse condo = 30% premium of EC and so on until no $1M no talk
so that land can be sold at hundreds and hundreds of millions to developer
if govt cannot collect billions and billions dollars from land sale
no gst voucher, no pg card, no holiday ... muahahaha
 
owner stay in mickey mouse condo private = must think how to "help" owner for passive income to fund the million dollar mickey mouse condo
 
more owner can buy mickey mouse condo = higher collection in land sales can charge developer sky high
 
rent out hdb to ft = can import more ft
 
rent out hdb = can collect tax
 
unlimited sales $ collection, tax $ collection, wheel $ of fortune, good way to up $ gdp, etc
 
to be honest, I really cannot understand the rationale a hdb owner can buy private property but not the other way. worse still, these hdb owner actually  stay in private property and rent out whole hdb unit.

Fully agreed, once out of the system ie public housing, can't come back in again but other way round can. It's like they protect only those staying in public housing forgetting that when this group of people buy private, aren't they the same as those who are already in private??

Someone is paying for HDB's way, certainly not me, I am probably a beneficiary.  But.... 
It is a joke how many people are using HDB to make money and not for own long term stay.  When so many people buy HDB with the sole purpose of making money and not to start a family (as first roof over their head), I know HDB has lost it liow.  I ask a junior recently why he geared up so much to buy a resale HDB, which I deem as excessively expensive given his limited pay package.  He told me he will sell it 5 years later, so big loan is not an issue.  Well, it might make sense for him but something is definitely amiss here. 
 
Even my single friend, who is nearing 35, and has a decent paying job is thinking of getting as big a HDB resale unit as possible, near the MRT so that she can rent it out, maybe she will lock up 1 room, I don't know but she is not likely to stay there for more than 1 week.

This is still illegal. Better hope she doesn't have big mouth friends, colleagues or problems with her tenant otherwise they can just report her.
 
If her tenants have problems with her neighbour, they can also report her.

rental yield around 2%. comparable to prime D9 
 
probably HDB offers better value
 
but logic doesnt prevail when the market is still so hot
 
people will still rush to buy... luckily got so many units, everyone will get to have a chance one

If thats the type of tenants that northpark investers are targeting then they are in big trouble liao hahaha
 
I am not saying must target atas type of people, but really the net must cast wider.

The HDB flats around northpark are quite old and tenants may prefer to pay a bit more for modern design and new fixtures.

$15.8m loss in St Regis penthouse sale 'small change' for Japanese billionaire

Mr Katsumi Tada, 69, paid $28 million for a 6,017 sq ft penthouse at St Regis Residences in 2007, but sold it last month for $12.2 million.



 

By Cheryl Ong
 
 

The Japanese billionaire who suffered a record $15.8 million loss when he offloaded a penthouse in Tanglin Road is not one to shy away from making aggressive bets in real estate.
Mr Katsumi Tada, 69, president of Daisho Group, is known for paying top dollar to land prized assets that seem to promise future earnings.
The purchase of The Westin Singapore hotel in Marina Bay by his Daisho Group for a record-smashing $1.5 million per room in December 2013 is a case in point.
The landmark deal was the company's maiden purchase in Singapore and came as the local hotel sector faced headwinds from declining room rates and new completions.

 
However, analysts noted then that "Daisho is buying into the future", as the hotel's Marina Bay location could face an undersupply of rooms as the area develops.
Mr Tada set another record in 2007 when he paid a whopping $28 million - or $4,654 per sq ft (psf) - for a plush 6,017 sq ft penthouse at St Regis Residences in Tanglin Road.
This broke the previous psf benchmark of $4,200 paid for a four-bedroom unit at Chyau Fwu Group's 35-unit Parkview Eclat in Grange Road.
The purchase represented a remarkable gain of $12.77 million for the seller, also a foreigner, who had paid $15.23 million - or $2,530 psf - to developer City Developments in August 2006.
Now, Mr Tada has set a record of a different kind by selling the penthouse for a bargain-basement $12.2 million, or $2,028 psf, racking up the biggest loss suffered on an apartment sale here.
The sale - to Yun Nam Hair Care owner Andy Chua - at a price well below market value has baffled analysts, who noted that the $12.2 million would be "pocket change" for Mr Tada, who is estimated by Forbes to be worth about US$1.7 billion (S$2.4 billion).
The Straits Times understands that Mr Tada, who also bought a smaller 3,897 sq ft home at the 173-unit St Regis project for about $11.6 million, had been trying to sell both for more than two years. Three units in the development, spanning 2,153 to 4,941 sq ft, have changed hands for between $1,923 psf and $2,276 psf in the past two months.
Ms Christine Li, research director at Cushman & Wakefield, said the billionaire could have just been rebalancing his portfolio of investments as opportunities appear elsewhere.
"To him, a $15.8 million loss is not a big deal. A lot of billionaires buy properties and leave them vacant because rental income is negligible to them and holding costs aren't that high," said Ms Li.
The penthouse is said to have been vacant all this while - another factor which could have led to a "deterioration" of the unit, said a veteran market watcher who did not wish to be named.
"Since he didn't stay in it, he could have realised the unit was not what he wanted. For the obscenely rich, they can do anything they like."
Another analyst added that the absolute loss could have been smaller than what was recorded, thanks to tax considerations and currency conversions, as the Singapore dollar has strengthened against the yen.

Condo sales record modest gain for February

 
posted on 17 Mar 2015 SHARE 
 
 


BY CHERYL ONG
 

Straits Times
 


CONDOMINIUM sales improved in February, with buyers targeting units at previously launched projects.
There were 382 apartments sold last month, a modest 2 per cent gain over the 374 units moved in January, the Urban Redevelopment Authority reported yesterday.

The improvement came despite only one new project going on the market: Just 357 units were launched last month, down from 421 in January.
"Market activity remained muted as home buyers largely kept to the sidelines amid nagging concerns which include the potential supply overhang, climbing interest rates and a soft rental market, all of which point to heightened expectations of possible downward price adjustments," said Ms Chia Siew Chuin, director of research and advisory at Colliers.

Despite the slight uptick in February, only 756 new units were sold in the first two months of the year - potentially leading to the slowest quarter of sales since the fourth quarter of 2008 when the financial crisis was in full swing. Only 419 units were sold in that three-month period.
Homes in the city-fringe areas chalked up sales of 183 units last month on the back of GuocoLand's new project, Sims Urban Oasis. The 1,024-unit project in Aljunied was February's bestseller, with 112 apartments snapped up at a median price of $1,397 per sq ft (psf).
Ms Christine Li, research head at Cushman & Wakefield, noted that Guoco had likely launched the project despite sluggish demand so that buyers could visit its show suite during the four-day Chinese New Year holiday weekend. The project has since sold 196 units.
Suburban projects recorded sales of 173 units while condominiums in the city centre moved 26 units.
The tepid sales, a result of a "web of policies curbing market demand", have led developers to accumulate unsold units, said Dr Chua Yang Liang, head of research and consultancy at JLL.
He estimates that developers are holding on to 21,000 units that have yet to find buyers.
"Developers are likely to feel the pressure," said Dr Chua, and will probably adopt "innovative measures" to sell units in the next few months. This could draw buyers back and bring new home sales for the full year to between 4,800 and 5,800 units. Last year, 7,378 units were sold - the lowest since 2008, when 4,264 units were sold.
Upcoming projects include Frasers Centrepoint's 920-unit North Park Residences and UOL Group's 797-unit Botanique at Bartley. Both are expected to be launched within the fortnight.

Frankly speaking it doesnt make sense that private condos in Yishun can sell more than $1100 when prices of HDBs in Yishun, together with woodlands and Sembawang are the lowest in Singapore. 
 
And look at those old condos like lilydale, orchid park, Emerald, Sapphire, their rental have fallen so badly that it is obvious when supply is abundant, economy is stagnant, condos in not so good location will suffer the most.

it doesnt matter that the market doesnt make sense
 
cos the market can remain irrational longer than an investor can remain solvent
 
hence if no urgent need to buy then wait
 
however it seems that there are a lot of people in SG with a very urgent need to buy

reasons:
 
- started by HDB - stopped supply to zero for 3 yrs when converted to BTO scheme
- increase ppl coming to SG
- pressure on HDB resale causing price to go up
- HDB happily mark BTO to 'market' thereby continuing the price explosion
- hdb happily introduced DBSS thereby pushing EC and condo price further up
- after all this, suburban price exploded too. impact not so obvious as developers reduce average area of units
- for past 7 yrs, people got used to condos selling out within a month. This is highly unusual. when mkt is in equil, it would normally take a year to 2 yrs to sell out. Hence now when sales rate drop, ppl suddenly start screaming the market is dead. unfortunately this is not so. thanks to HDB, u will continue to see the crazy price for a while longer before mkt can start adjusting
- note that prime is out of the above equation, as the craziness is all caused by HDB thereby only affecting the public and EC and suburban condo market only. Prime is still very much affected by broader investment climate

all relative.
 
15m to a billionaire is like a few hundred to us
 
a few hundred to us is like a year's wages to someone in 3rd world
 
so most impt is to be happy and stress free from financial burden

- started by HDB - stopped supply to zero for 3 yrs when converted to BTO scheme
- increase ppl coming to SG
- pressure on HDB resale causing price to go up
- HDB happily mark BTO to 'market' thereby continuing the price explosion
- hdb happily introduced DBSS thereby pushing EC and condo price further up
- after all this, suburban price exploded too. impact not so obvious as developers reduce average area of units
- for past 7 yrs, people got used to condos selling out within a month. This is highly unusual. when mkt is in equil, it would normally take a year to 2 yrs to sell out. Hence now when sales rate drop, ppl suddenly start screaming the market is dead. unfortunately this is not so. thanks to HDB, u will continue to see the crazy price for a while longer before mkt can start adjusting
- note that prime is out of the above equation, as the craziness is all caused by HDB thereby only affecting the public and EC and suburban condo market only. Prime is still very much affected by broader investment climate

how do u know he has been demoted?
 
maybe he is now making even more money than as the MND ministar? 

 
Off topic, do you think LKY's home in Oxley should be enbloc? Since it is sitting on prime land. 

 
it is on prime land
 
but whether en bloc or not depends on the market conditions right?
 
usually it happens at the beginning for the bull run when the land price still give the developer some more meat to eat and landowner also happy to sell at
 
now, developer only want to lowball land price and landowner not too willing to let go for cheap
 
so unlikely to have en bloc anytime soon

Just watch this show to learn how to hide in a convent without being detected.

https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/swanky-apartments-register-significant-losses-auctions-023743815--sector.html	Swanky apartments register significant losses at auctionsMore high-end homes went under the hammer at significant losses to opportunistic buyers during the first quarter of 2015, revealed Colliers International and reported in the media.
The Colliers report noted that five units in the central region were sold at auctions in Q1 2015, including two apartments at Twin Regency in Kim Tian Road and Pearl Bank in Outram that were auctioned off at $2.3 million and $1.35 million respectively.
The others were a unit at The Grange (Grange Road) which went for $4.15 million, an apartment at Ville Royale (River Valley) which sold for $1.83 million, and an Estilo unit (Wilkie Road) purchased at $800,000.
There is an increasing number of homes, particularly high-end properties, being transacted at 20-30 percent below the peak prices in 2007/2008. Hence, we are seeing opportunistic buyers who are quick to take advantage of the drop in prices to snap up well-located apartments in the prime areas, said Grace Ng, deputy managing director of Colliers International.
Meanwhile, buyers on the hunt for better deals at auctions can head down to Amara Hotel tomorrow afternoon. Knight Frank is organising a public auction at 2.30pm offering 26 properties. 17 are residential units and include posh apartments at The Sail @ Marina Bay, Altez in Tanjong Pagar and Orchard Scotts (Newton).

Taking this discussion to a more serious note, we may be treading on dangerous grounds with the recent property boom sending the wrong messages to the young.
 
I am flabbergasted not so long ago when conversing with a much younger person.
According to him, success is owning an investment property and collecting rent in comfort for the rest of his life.
 
Now, how many of us or our youths think this way?  Scarily, a huge percentage, i'm afraid.
This is a thought of complacency, a thought of taking things for granted that Singapore will always be what it has been for the last 30 yrs.  riding the wave of strong growth.
I personally believe that if we become a nation of landlords, we will be dead in no time.
 
I hope that we do not fall into this trap of dreaming to be just a landlord and letting others drive the economy.  We need to be the backbone of our own economy.  If not participating by working as an employee perhaps more so as a business owner directly.
 
I think that we must change the way we are conditioned to think.
That is of what success means.  
 
Owning an investment property is not the journey to success but rather the fruit of many a success.
In other words, it is part of the result and not seen as the method to attain it.
 
I hope that in future, we can see many more Singapore brands, businesses, Singaporeans running our own show,  instead of landlords waiting for tenants to come.  For there is a limit, and in my opinion, we are near that limit.

Yes correct, anyone still remember what mbt said during year 2011 GE election? Don't we people want to see our housing price keep rising? Even though the housing price is already not very affordable. Property agent, developer always want housing price to rise, the higher the property price they more happy. They keep avocation property price will only go up, and always say don't worry but already can rent out and earn passive income. But it's not sustainable if more and more people do that. Imagine if more and more people go buy property and rent out and earn passive income,  they thought the income is good just by rental and give up work and enjoy life just by collecting passive income. Singapore will be going in downward spiral as these are the conditions that make people feel that no need work can earn good income. And then push housing price up further. Good? It's a disaster waiting to happen. 
Now they government don't know when realise this and want to cool housing prices but developer and property agent don't want to budge, they keep think of creative ways just to make sure property price do not drop like giving property agent higher commission by selling instead of reducing selling price. They felt by selling lower will have domino effect and lower their income. I still feel government should keep very firm on the property cooling measures no matter how much pressure they keep come from property agent, developer and etc to ask government to remove the cooling measures. Also don't know why when government start to learn the toxic thing that the higher the property price they better without looking at overall sustainability.  I'll rather to have slower growth in property price or drop in property price then to have a false raise in property price due to expansion of money supply I.e qe1, qe2, qe3 and will there be more qe? Then when everything come crashing down it would be also very fast and by then those property agent,  developer u-turn and blame government why never do much to stop rising property price in 1st place when they knew how toxic the property price rise can be?

Actually, wouldn't the journey to owning an investment property compel that person to, in effect "drive the economy"...
I mean, the mindset is probably not right, but the ends justifies that thinking right?

Yes, i see your point but lets think a bit further.
Beyond that, what happens.
 
Say today, my father left me a business to takeover.
This business could spark an array of creations, be it wealth, knowledge or other inspirations leading towards bigger ideals.
 
Compare that to if he left me an investment property which i just rent out for $10k per month.
It wouldnt quite spark me to do anything and does not create multiples in the economy as much as a real business would. 
 
I say this becos i know of a handful of young people who enjoy this luxury.
They do not know what work really is. They just collect rent. A bit more or a bit less.
The sad truth is that that is all they think there is to it.
They are not stupid people but i think such a generation really becomes weak, soft and uncommitted.

To have a large inheritance and just more or less live off it with no ambition whatsoever?
 
That's just sad... and I honestly think that should be a minority.

But we all know that it is difficultWhat do i mean difficult?
 
Take myself for example.
 
I grew up in a HDB and only in my teens did my father start owning a japanese car 
Today my kids have the luxury of living in a newly built landed property and grow up being driven around in premium contis
 
i am not saying that i had a hard life when i was young.  I didnt. 
But as i progressed, i pass on this progression to my children wholeheartedly.
Just as how my father would want to pass on the progression to me.
 
Given a choice, many if not most of us ,fathers would want to hand down a life of luxury where our children and grandchildren have no need to struggle with life.
Thats normal.  
 
So what do i mean its difficult?
The difficulty sometimes ironic is in letting your kids rough it out and making their
 own.
I think i need to constantly remind myself to teach them that their life belongs to themselves and what they make out of it.  And while i will give them that hand of support, they should never take it for granted that it is for free or forever.
 
But its difficult. 
 
You know what i mean?

Just as how my father would want to pass on the progression to me.
 
Given a choice, many if not most of us ,fathers would want to hand down a life of luxury where our children and grandchildren have no need to struggle with life.
Thats normal.
 
So what do i mean its difficult?
The difficulty sometimes ironic is in letting your kids rough it out and making their
own.
I think i need to constantly remind myself to teach them that their life belongs to themselves and what they make out of it. And while i will give them that hand of support, they should never take it for granted that it is for free or forever.
 
But its difficult.
 
You know what i mean?

 
True that.

To have a large inheritance and just more or less live off it with no ambition whatsoever?
 
That's just sad... and I honestly think that should be a minority.

 
Yes you are right. 
 
That would be very sad.
 
If anyone is rich, please don't leave all your money
 
to your kids and spoil them. 
 
Just leave it all to me and help your kids
 
to have happy productive lives.
 
I am already spoilt and cannot be spoilt anymore.

What do i mean difficult?
 
Take myself for example.
 
I grew up in a HDB and only in my teens did my father start owning a japanese car 
Today my kids have the luxury of living in a newly built landed property and grow up being driven around in premium contis

Some truth to it but it is the values that is imparted that will determine how your kids will cope with life in the future, not the big houses and big cars they grow up with.  In feudal times, the rich just indulged their kids (富不过三代) but these days, even the very rich are pushing their kids very hard, especially in getting them educated and equipped for life.
 
I have come across many from privileged backgrounds that are super driven when it comes to work but they remain very pampered at home.  Of course there are the bums (二世祖) as well.

Yes, i see your point but lets think a bit further.
Beyond that, what happens.
 
Say today, my father left me a business to takeover.
This business could spark an array of creations, be it wealth, knowledge or other inspirations leading towards bigger ideals.
 
Compare that to if he left me an investment property which i just rent out for $10k per month.
It wouldnt quite spark me to do anything and does not create multiples in the economy as much as a real business would. 
 
I say this becos i know of a handful of young people who enjoy this luxury.
They do not know what work really is. They just collect rent. A bit more or a bit less.
The sad truth is that that is all they think there is to it.
They are not stupid people but i think such a generation really becomes weak, soft and uncommitted.
I heard the scions of certain property developers are already doing that 
Have doctor and lawyer degrees but don't practise 
 
Just sit around enjoy life and collect millions every month
 
Hire a chairman and ceo to run the business can liao

Actually, to clarify, its not that its wrong to hire a chairman or CEO or directors to run the business.
Becos that could be the most effective way.  
But dont just go buying properties and living off the rental thinking that that is the ultimate in life lah.....

Thats a fair possibility.
 
Sibor confirm will go up. Between late last year until 1st qtr this year it has already doubled.
By end 2015, definitely up by another 50% at least.

this means the actual transacted price is recorded after all these "benefits" or still recorded at sales price?
after 20 Jul 15, will we see a sharp drop of transcted price?
 

More comprehensive information in transaction documents 
The Option to Purchase and Sale & Purchase Agreement, which are standard forms prescribed under the Housing Developers Rules, will also be amended  to enhance the safeguards for purchasers of private residential properties. For example, developers must indicate the value of any benefits (such as cash rebates, absorption of legal fees or stamp fees, rental guarantees and furniture vouchers) offered to buyers.
The amendments to both forms will take effect on 20 July 2015. This is to provide developers sufficient time to comply with the amendments.

There was talk to show actual transacted price meaning disclosing the true actual transacted base price 
However we all know how crafty the developers will be to hide this to show a different story for the longest time. 
Instead of direct discounts to price, they absorb this and that, give vouchers for interior design, give vouchers for cold storage and petrol etcetc....going forward...they will think of something to go round the system lah.  Everything to prop reported prices up.
 
We know why, dont we?
 
Just look at the 50% DP rule for car purchase.  We still have 10% today.
I say clamp them down!

HDB LOOKING INTO RAISING INCOME CEILING 
HDB is also looking into raising the income ceiling for those hoping to buy new HDB flats and executive condominiums, according to Mr Khaw. Changes are likely to be made known in August as well.
 
The last time the income ceiling for Build-to-Order (BTO) flats was raised was in 2011, from S$8,000 to S$10,000. Likewise for executive condominiums, the income limit was raised in 2011 from S$10,000 to S$12,000.

Mr Khaw said about 80 per cent of applicants meet the requirements for purchasing a HDB flat, and it is uncommon for prospective buyers to have income that exceeds the income ceiling.  
 
Well, that is coming from Captain Obvious. Those that do not meet the requirement evidently will not be applying for it in the first place.

if owner buys a pc and still keep hdb, owner must stay in hdb (rent out pc)

 
Allowed la.
 
HDB buy PC can rent out HDB.
 
The complaint is that own PC cannot buy HDB to rent out either PC or HDB.

 
Well, that is coming from Captain Obvious. Those that do not meet the requirement evidently will not be applying for it in the first place.

 
Hahaha. At least you can't accuse this politician of lying!

My understanding is Private owners can't buy HDB unless they sell their private property.
 
HDB owners can buy Private but must live in the HDB. Idea is that the Private is for Investment but I don't think you can stay in the Private and rent out the HDB cos that would mean you do not need the HDB and so should sell it away. HDB is not meant for investment.

keep hdb ... let out to collect rental ... and the "legendary" lock 1-room
buy hdb ... let out to FT and use the rental income to fund 2-bedder mickey mouse condo ... lol
buy hdb ... let out and stay in jb
buy hdb and live with in-law (this one besterest ... no need to pay rent and food ... muahahaha)
 
HDB generates the highest ROI ... lol

Yup. Before MOP is up, cannot rent out the whole flat.
 
Lock 1 room and rent out the rest is also illegal - If your tenant or neighbour complains the gg to you.

Retrenchment package is not a compulsory thing so companies can choose not to give anything okay?
 
But I've also seen some companies that state the retrenchment benefits in the official contract (very rare!).

As far as I know, the approval is not exceptional. Everyone I know who has tried applying has gotten the approval (provided you meet the criteria la).
 
That's not to say that they can't suddenly change their minds though.

Yeah purposely put like that. Easy to rescind if enough people make noise about it one day. But unlikely since, 80% still live in HDB and have upgrading dreams.

Not industry issue then can move companies - no need to drive taxi.
 
How come need 2 years to retrench anyway?
 
Anyway, if you are really going to drive taxi, you can try uber with your private car (save on taxi rental  )

it's hard to believe developer do not raise price or do not shrink size (useable space)
these are the 2 things in developer mind 24x7
 
 

Actually, if HDB resists temption to shrink unit size and control pricing (various methods to do this, even for resale market) while private developers continues to do so, there will come a tipping point whereby HDB offers better and more spacious living for family and people stop buying 700- 800 sq ft 3BR private condo. Possible?

Think this one sells well cos the overall quantum is more affordable. In fact, from what I read, their 1 room and 1+1 rooms were in great demand and there were many buyers after these units.
 
Think the mindset these days amongst S'porean investors are to grab a private property no matter what as "sure go up, can make money" mentality is ingrained. Obviously, the studios being more affordable attract the most attention. Developers also build accordingly and compared to the past, more % of smaller units are being built.
 
I'm not entirely convinced to invest in these units as in time to come, they will be aplenty but then again I have a terrible track record as far as property is concerned so what do I know

It has some unique offerings due to its huge number of units. Seldom hear of condo with nine commercial units nowadays. Might entice due to its self-sufficient nature, even though the number of units is astounding, and some would classify as public housing.
 
The smaller units might be suitable for singles and divorcees, couples without children etc.

most units sold are 1 bedder somemore... looks like investment demand is still sibei "weak" in today's bear market 
 
i really pity these 1100 buyers, if only they spend some time surfing MCF, they would have known that prices will drop another 20% by 2019. really overpaid big time

Look at it this way.
 
If they bought a few years earlier, with the same price, they might have gotten a unit 20% larger. 
 
But who is to say that a few years later, with the same price, they won't be able to get another unit 20% larger (or even larger) than one today? It's really hard to say for sure - who can guarantee?
 
Most important is whether they are able to derive value out of the move, whether for own stay or rent. If they are not sure of their game plan(s), then it's still not bad a strategy to stay put and hold cash, go for other kinds of investments etc.
 
This particular development TOP at 2019 and as of this year, Govt has slowed down the release of new sites very much. Who knows for sure what the market conditions will be like in 2019? Everyone has to be responsible for their own choices, whether or not it is induced by forum or other people.

Look at it this way.
 
If they bought a few years earlier, with the same price, they might have gotten a unit 20% larger. 
 
But who is to say that a few years later, with the same price, they won't be able to get another unit 20% larger (or even larger) than one today? It's really hard to say for sure - who can guarantee?
 

 
 
yes, you are absolutely right. who can guarantee?
 
hahahahhaa

There are also moderated risks as well if one needs housing options urgently.
 
Prices surely can't shoot up anymore, but what if they continue to creep up slowly? Or what if Govt policy suddenly changes?
 
There is no guarantee for both directions.

Well done.
 
As long as put money to the mouth, i respect.
 
I am one of those better off holding liquid assets
I can buy back what i sold earlier, for less today and my liquid assets yield average 5%pa net 
 
But of course if you fall in the mass market, i feel sorry becos thats where the ratrace is most intensed
Its an irony sometimes, the lower down the food chain the more people try to keep up with the joneses
Some bank executives even buy fake watches to impress people.  
 
Why why must be like that? 
In front of people, they talk very big, like as though they handle $200bil project and they have 3000 emplyees etc....
But behind the scenes, the family not enough money, children not well taken care of and instalments big big.     
 
Why why why like that?  
 
I must seek my 大哥  Latio for a chat soon.  He has the true vision to lead me out of disillusion.

Bro T2, I think you have a clear vision and will do well no matter what happens.
 
And for the class of asset you are looking and aiming for, there might still be some way more to go so I think it might be wise to wait.
 
But for those struggling and swimming upstream from the mass market to have a decent retirement, the options and experience are quite different. Withholding funds from what satisfies their basic needs might actually be an unwise decision.
 
It is a heavily individualised situation. No right or wrong answer.
 
I am still saving for my first (and hopefully real) watch haha... Because family still uses a huge chunk of my cash flow.

I must correct myself - actually have a string of watches. Have not spent over $100 for myself before on a watch. For my wife, the cap is five times that. The ones in existence are either free gifts or gifts or hand-me-downs. Mostly still very functional and correct 99% of the day - helps me curb the poison in me...

might as well buy the watch now and move on, instead of thinking and thinking about it 
 
since you are neither a watch enthusiast nor collector, but more of a "been there done that" experience

Well thanks for the faith.
 
Speaking as a person who lived in HDB from 3 until age of 28, i will say that owning a real watch is not important but rather being real to own that watch, that is the most important.
 
Some people scrimp and save to buy a watch twice their month salary.
They baby the watch and protect it from every single possibility of scratch including keeping it instead of wearing it.
When they wear the watch , they do so with much pride and satisfaction until they see someone wear one which cost three times their salary.  
 
All this is still fine , dont get me wrong.  Taking care of ones possessions is a good value.
However, if the money which was used to buy the vanity could clearly be better used for not other people but their own family especially towards basic needs, then i feel really sorry for that guy even if he were wearing a $500k watch.
 
Therefore wearing a real watch is good, but being real when wearing that watch is a lot more meaningful.    Thats the difference between truly owning the watch versus letting the watch own you.
 
Best regards 
Donny

Your words carry more sincerity than an authentic watch workshop! 
 
I won't wear watch comparing its value with others. Same for properties as well. Everyone has his own runway I feel. And I feel the same as you do, that basic needs of family should be settled before we even ponder over luxury or big ticket items. 
 
Thanks for sharing your insightful thoughts. Two thumbs up!

And while the long queues served as a poignant reminder of just how worried the Greek people truly were about the future, the more shocking images surfaced around 24 hours later when the shelves at Greek grocery stores began to resemble those of another socialist paradise: Venezuela. 
The empty supermarket shelves and long waits at gas stations presaged the acute credit crunch that accompanied the imposition of capital controls.

In short, an economy already in free fall slipped into a terminal decline.

Whatever the case, the country remains, for now, stuck in what can only be described as a depression which is why we weren’t entirely surprised to hear that half of Athens’ real estate agents have been forced to close their doors as the property market in Greece is now almost completely dependent upon buyers who can afford to pay cash. Here’s Bloomberg with "a day in the life of a Greek realtor."

Villas being built near Batam in lagoon with dolphins, developer eyes Singapore buyers

An Indonesian developer says Singapore buyers are showing keen interest in a project promising villas built over the sea, with dolphins at the residents' doorsteps.
 
Batam-based developer PT Batam Island Marina and its Singapore investment partner Seven Seas FID are planning 64 villas, each shaped like a round bamboo hut and built around a lagoon with dolphins which residents can feed and play with.
 
Priced at $758,000 each, the villas were launched here two weeks ago with a blaze of advertisements showing dolphins leaping out of the water, and the Marina Bay Sands skyline on the horizon. The project is coming up in the midst of six small islands known collectively as Pulau Manis, 3km off Batam.
 
Each villa has two bedrooms and is about the size of a Housing Board executive flat. The developer has promised shops and restaurants nearby, but has been mum about maintenance costs and whether residents must pay for the dolphins' upkeep.
 
Half the units went on sale at a swanky showroom in the upmarket One Degree 15 marina on Sentosa two weeks ago. A visit there found the place buzzing at the launch.
 
A team of about 10 salesmen dressed in suits attended to a steady stream of walk-in prospects, showing them a multimedia presentation, artists' impressions and a scale model of the villas, before discussing the financing plans over snacks, coffee and soft drinks.
 
According to Funtasy Island Development, a Singapore firm set up in 2010 to market the dolphin villas and other homes on Pulau Manis, there is no shortage of buyers.
 
Director Michael Yong declined to give exact figures but said the initial sales "exceeded expectations". A Malaysian with Singapore permanent residency, he owns 30 per cent of Funtasy Island Development. The rest is owned by Indonesian businessmen Ade Soehari and Luky Winata.
 
The project is coming up in an area owned by PT Batam Island Marina. Foreigners cannot own land in Indonesia but can be granted 25-year leases which can be extended in 20-year blocks. The Indonesian company has promised on its website to renew Funtasy Island's leases up to 2112.
 
There are eight other housing projects being built on Pulau Manis, with a total of 621 units - 159 are built over water and the rest are bungalows and apartments built on land.
 
Mr Yong's firm is marketing these properties and he said he has sold 90 per cent of the units so far, raking in $250 million since 2011.
 
"About 70 per cent of buyers were Singaporeans," he added.
 
None of the projects has been completed. At least one development, a cluster of bungalows that should have been completed last year, has been delayed. The latest project, the dolphin villas, is slated to be ready by the end of 2018.
 
The six islands have a land area of about 1 sq km, or about 140 football fields. The developer had included the waters around the islands in its calculation when it claimed in its promotional material that the "theme park" will be about two-thirds the size of Sentosa.
 
Besides the dolphin lagoon, the theme park also promises an aviary, a stingray habitat and boat ride through mangrove swamps. Visitors and residents will have access to the theme parks, the developer said in its brochures and website.
 
Visitors from Singapore now have to take a 45-minute ferry ride from HarbourFront Centre to Batam's Sekupang Ferry Terminal, clear Indonesian immigration and then hire a local boat for a 15-minute trip to Pulau Manis.
 
Mr Yong said the 16km journey between Sentosa and the islands will take just 20 minutes when his firm launches a direct ferry service.
 
A Sunday Times team visited the project site two weeks ago and was told by local fishermen that the islands were uninhabited until construction started a few years ago.
 
There were at least 50 uncompleted bungalows, part of a project called Corallium Villas that was supposed to have been ready in the middle of last year.
 
Mr Yong confirmed the delay and said it was caused by a longer than expected time to get an expert to conduct a green building study before construction could begin.
 
He said the affected buyers were paid $3 million in compensation for the delay. "This will come from future profits, so we still are financially sound," he said.
 
Retiree Serene Cheong was one of those who bought a $500,000 bungalow there in 2012. She was not too bothered when told that her bungalow, slated for completion next year, was six to nine months behind schedule.
 
"I am not too concerned because that is expected for waterfront projects where they have to do the piling deep in the water, " said Mrs Cheong, who is married and in her 50s.
 
The projects off Batam are not subject to any rules which apply to Singapore property projects as they are foreign property developments.
 
A spokesman for the Council of Estate Agencies said: "Whether consumers buy directly from foreign developers or through an estate agent, they should exercise due diligence before entering into any agreement to buy foreign properties."
 
Funtasy Island has guaranteed buyers a rental yield of 7 per cent a year for three years. This is typical of projects marketed in Jakarta, said Mr Ku Swee Yong, chief executive of estate agency Century 21.
 
Aside from evaluating the risks of overseas purchases, he said buyers of the Pulau Manis developments should consider longer-term factors like maintenance costs.
 
"The houses are built over sea water," he pointed out. "The build quality has to be top-notch and maintenance costs will be higher."

Watchdog takes issue with Batam villa ads
22/07/2015 on mypaper
By TOH YONG CHUAN
 

LAGOON LIVING: Each of the 64 two-bedroom villas - about the size of a Housing Board executive flat - is built around a lagoon with dolphins on Pulau Manis. (PHOTO: THE STRAITS TIMES)
 
In April, property developers behind a Batam villa project splashed print advertisements promising views of Marina Bay Sands and leaping dolphins at residents' doorsteps.
 
But now, advertising watchdog Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore (Asas) has objected to the ads and asked the developers to change them.
 
It found three things unacceptable: claiming that landmarks such as Marina Bay Sands are visible from the villa; promising a guaranteed rental of 7 per cent a year; and quoting an anonymous buyer on how wonderful the development is.
 
The watchdog reviewed the ads after a Sunday Times report in May on the villas, which cost $758,000 each and are being built around a lagoon of captive dolphins.
 
It told The Straits Times that it had informed the developer about the objections last month.
 
Asas chairman Tan Sze Wee said that when an advertiser is informed that certain parts of an ad are not acceptable, the advertiser has to stop making the objectionable claims "with immediate effect in all current and future marketing communications".
 
The developers behind the dolphin lagoon villas are Singapore-registered firms Funtasy Island Development and Seven Seas FID. The project is located on a cluster of six small islands collectively known as Pulau Manis, 3km off Batam.
 
Each of the 64 two-bedroom villas - about the size of a Housing Board executive flat and shaped like a round bamboo hut - is built around a lagoon with dolphins which residents can feed and play with.
 
The developers have promised shops and restaurants nearby, and a direct ferry service from Singapore's HarbourFront Cruise and Ferry Terminal.
 
The villas, which are slated to be completed by the end of 2018, were launched at the upmarket One Degree 15 Marina on Sentosa in April.
 
The villas around the dolphin lagoon are part of a larger development of eight other housing projects on Pulau Manis, with a total of more than 600 units of villas, bungalows and apartments.
 
The development sits on land owned by PT Batam Island Marina. The Indonesian company has promised on its website to renew land leases up to 2112.
 
Foreigners cannot own land in Indonesia, but can be granted leases to use the land.
 
Kelly Huang, spokesman for Funtasy Island, said that the developer "will observe the guidance" given by the advertising watchdog.
 
"We will work closely with Asas in the future," she said. "At this point, we have not decided the manner of how the ads will come out."
 
A check of Funtasy Island's website last week found that the Marina Bay Sands skyline, 7 per cent annual rent guarantee and ringing endorsement by the anonymous buyer - aspects that Asas objected to - were still prominently featured.
 
"Asas has jurisdiction over only local print and broadcast advertisements, but not what the companies do online," said Ku Swee Yong, chief executive of estate agency Century 21.
 
"There is nothing stopping a developer from putting information on Facebook or the Internet.
 
"This is a key weakness."

a mass market $1M property plunge to $600K? can happen bo? highly unlikely la
high class condo $3.5M drop below $3M, can la
 
Say you have a property worth $1 million. You take out a home loan to buy it, and after a few years servicing the loan, you still owe $700,000. 
Suddenly, the property market crashes, and the value of your house plummets. The bank conducts a valuation, and it determines that your house is now worth only $600,000. This is less than your outstanding home loan of $700,000!
 
The bank can then choose to issue an on-margin call, and you would need to top up the difference of $100,000. You can do this using either cash, or your CPF.

wow 
 
no wonder so many singaporeans so confident of buying $1.2M condo
 
can sell out thousands in just a week
 
whereas high end sell 10 in a year
 
i'm guessing developers of high end will start building 400sqft 3-bedrooms to move their stock... and people will buy!

a mass market $1M property plunge to $600K? can happen bo? highly unlikely la
high class condo $3.5M drop below $3M, can la
 
This is not entirely correct in real world. 
Say you borrow $700k to buy $1mil property.
For prudence, banks will assign a Haircut to the value to that property, which is at least 10% sometimes even more.
Therefore even though valuation is $1mil, collateral value is only $900k.
If the value of the home drops to $900k the collateral value is only $810k
 
Banks can technically call back loan at any point in time as long as they see a risk which they need to mitigate.  
 
Bottomline, just dont bite off more than you can chew thats all.

So it has been two years since i sold my D9 property in July 2013.
Somewhat coinciding with the start of this thread.
 
As you all know, i hv been calling for a drop and putting my money where my mouth is.
Today sunday so chobo chobo went to check caveats lodge.....
Wahaha 20% lower than what i sold for!
 
Yet propertyguru agents still listing at at july 2013 prices,....wah lau who they trying to cheat?
 
 
On a more serious note, i do know of some who were screwed becos they trusted their agents to drive the price up for them. 
 
One such case is a personal friend, who put up his place for sale sometime 2014.
Agent advised him to raise price by 20% even though he was ok to close lower and more realistically.
Unfortunately, despite relaying his wishes to the agent, he was too easygoing and trusted the agent to manage it for him.  In the end, he was not able to sell his property becos agent advertised it too high and  probably ignored some offers too.  Lucky he rolled his rental contract but for about $500 lower
 
Now that prices are even lower, and buyers are even more cautious, he is faced with a much lower price if he wants to close the deal.  So as with many people, they hold back thinking a better price is round the corner.....hai.....from making some reasonable profit to making miserable profit and holding a risk.
At 40++, if he loses his job, confirm cannot get back one paying the same.

D9 landed impact is definitely great. The pool of buyers and players is already tiny to begin with. 
 
If TDSR is never lifted, the end of the tunnel will definitely be very long for them. 
 
But not all property prices would behave in this nature. I also place money where my mouth is. From 2012 to now, the price has gone up more than 10% based on recent caveats lodged. Of course, the road ahead is hard to say but that is also where the fun is.

I see. Thanks for sharing. 
 
Landed drop has been steepest over the last year, that's partly why I have mistaken. I am also surprised you are actually into condo sector to begin with.  
 
Small condos are a very niche market. Nowadays, it's all very locality and price sensitive - need to have a good balance of both to thrive. Location also needs to be sensitive to the demographics of the region.
 
Hope things turn out well for your friend.

i don;t know what kind of crazy agent your friend engaged.
 
an agent's wet dream is to find a seller like your friend willing to sell low
 
and buyer willing to buy high
 
he must be mad to want to closer 20% higher and forgo the chance to close a deal quickly and move on
 
if i were your friend's agent, i would have asked him to drop another 10% to move it quickly

It's also possible that the friend pointed finger later on to the agent but did not commit to action to sell earlier on. Maybe half-hearted in wanting to sell.
 
Just a possibility, not really insinuating anything.
 
We are individually responsible for the actions we made or did not make. A change of agent is quite easy for one possible course of action that could have been undertaken.

Does not make sense for an agent.... As long property sold, he gets his comma....yes, holding out for client if u think is grossly under value but in the case of a sinking market, the advise could be better. If the agent is in the market long enough and has transacted properties at that segment, he could easily tell the market based on the number of viewings, the offer price etc if the number of viewers dried up, isn't it telling u that market is seriously going down?
 
Bottom line, your fried got a lousy agent.

That's why as much as possible avoid all agents. Be it housing, car, insurance. If you make money or lose money they still get their cut. What's the risk to them.

Bro T2, not flaming you. But you got the wrong type of property for the locality you chose to buy.
 
That kind of size in that kind of district very hard to get supporters to either buy or rent from you. My opinion only. It's like getting a half gold Rolex based on your description in the Watches thread.
 
If D9 should get below 600 sqft, in fact my personal opinion is below 400 sqft. Over 1000 sqft should get near employment nodes or hubs with good local or foreign schools. That is if you intend to earn from the move. If buy as ostentatious goods (for show or display shiok), then be prepared for huge price movements beyond your control. Demographic considerations for your tenant or the next buyer is crucial to win in upmarket and downmarket.
 
I have relatives and close friends who are agents. I try to let them earn and they also try to work to my benefits. So far its win-win.

no, more exp
 
cos after one bowl, i will still be hungry and buy another bowl
 
so end up over eating and paying much more  

it's all a big mess that KBW is creating
 
i think it is more constructive to create a simpler public housing system
 
why the heck u need to have shorter leasehold? somemore in 5 yearly increments? trying to create more jobs in HDB??
 
studio and 2rm flats are obviously for the needy/ elderly who are not financially well-off. Just give them a 99 yr leasehold at $50K lah. how much "losses" will HDB incur by doing so? Are there 50,000 applicants? 100K applicants every year?
 
Then when pass away, pro-rate the remaining equity to their kids or grandkids

Think the most impt question is whether those flats on shorter leases can be sold in open market or has to be returned to HDB like the previous studio apts. If can be sold in open market then not too bad but not sure on the loan issue with the banks for the buyers though. Otherwise if return to HDB is sure lose money n as good as renting from them actually.

If can sell in open market, it becomes another money spinning scheme. The shorter lease should really be meant for own stay.

It could still hv rules to compel own stay but allowing owners to sell off to open mkt upon death or when one is not in good health anymore so hv to stay in home or with children. The current studio just pays u back what is left of the lease period proportionately which makes it a rental flat in theory. 
 
Anyway, with such a short lease, don't think u can make money out of this but this is more to ensure u hv money left when u most need it otherwise your capital would hv depreciated under the current scheme.

Is for a few groups of people. 1 group doesn't like to loan at all or not eligible. The other group treats it as rental flat - there are those who want to use housing for own stay and not for any other purposes. Because of their age, and perhaps even lack of close kins (no offspring etc) they may not be concerned about the length of the lease. Affordability is the key concern.

All flats are on rental lah... even 99 years also rental just a bit longer only!
 
Unless HDB sells below construction costs and has to demolish upon the flats being returned, ah king will not lose money one.  It will just take back and sell it again at "market" price and make more $$.
 
I personally advocate ALL HDB flats to be resold only back to HDB. Forget about making a windfall from the flat, that quick flip era is gone for good.  The less money tied up in property, the more people will take a bit more risk to be more entrepreneurial and create jobs.  That's what Singapore needs, more businessmen, more start-ups, not more landlords.

yes, this is the best
property speculation is the worst productive investment
flip higher and higher with zero output
$$$ should be poured into investment that can produce output
unfortunately, in spore ... the most recommended (push) investment tool is property, property and property

From 2012 there have been many cautionary articles on this. In fact, it led to Minister Khaw restricting numbers of shoebox apartments in suburban developments in 2012, who called it an untested market.

The cards have all been laid right from the start. In fact, the oversupply was previously projected to be right now (2015), but in recent articles pushed back to 2017.

don't worry
 
when the rents drop to $500 per month for each shoebox unit, i will help the landlords by renting 4 units side by side for the whole family
 
then i rent out my hdb flat for $2500, still have positive cash flow $500 per month

even during the days of alexis in 2009, it was already clear that shoebox is a failed concept and a wonderful by-product of high psf price trying to package into bite-sized unit for the speculator
 
however, greed often trumps logic so... too bad

Actually I am very very surprised that Guru just accepted % reported in ST article, because for articles stating great sales or high PSF, the Guru scoffs at them mostly with his watches that I greatly admire, even though those were real transacted prices.
 
I have tried hard to look for evidence that price has softened by 10% since mid 2013, and believe me, any "evidence" is few and very far in between. I looked in districts 5, 14 and 19 as there were a quite a few well known projects with many mickey mouse units. For most of the projects, it was just one or two transactions in 2015. Many of the times, no transaction at all. The previous batches, many were Freehold, so its hard to say for sure if the same trends can be seen for leasehold units, for which prices are cheaper to begin with. The data a few years down the road will be interesting and noteworthy for High Park Residences etc, LH99 MM units. I am not vested in any of the projects listed here.
 
Whether there is indeed a 10% drop, I think all gurus here can draw their own conclusions from these few random searches. Caveat emptor.

Just sharing based on data only. Dreams is one thing but being accurate in portrayal is another. We are also entitled to own opinions separate from what data says.
 
SRPI for small apartments did register index drop of about 10% from the peak to current.
 
http://www.ires.nus.edu.sg/webapp/srpi/default.aspx
 
The lack of resales and the huge sales in the outskirt areas led me to suspect that the "drop" is due at least in part to the shift in locality and tenure of sold apartments. From more central locations to more far flung ones and from freehold to leasehold.
 
My opinions only. Please feel free to disagree.

Vegetable Buyer: Hey, do you sell vegetables?
 
Fish Seller: Nope I only sell fish. Please pick the type you want as displayed Sir. We have all kinds of fish, big or small, bony or less bones, more expensive and less expensive. What would you like?
 
Vegetable Buyer: How much is your grouper?
 
Fish Seller: $4X per kg Sir.
 
Vegetable Buyer: So expensive? You trying to Tok people right? How about the snapper?
 
Fish Seller: $3X per kg Sir.
 
Vegetable Buyer: Still very expensive! Last time when I was young, it was only $1X per kg.
 
Fish Seller: The labour and transport costs to supply the fish nowadays is much higher, my cost of living also higher now, no way to sell at yesterday's price. 
 
Vegetable Buyer: Based on the cycle of prices, it will have to come down soon. I don't believe it can stay high.
 
Fish Seller: Fish are harder to catch nowadays. Yes certain months more supply but overall still going up. All the fishmongers trading at these prices.
 
Vegetable Buyer: OK, how about the golden pomfret? 
 
Fish Seller: Oh that is $1X per kg Sir. Does it meet your budget?
 
Vegetable Buyer: It does yes. But I am not here to buy fish. I am a vegetarian, only shopping for myself, so no way I will buy fish.
 
Fish Seller: I see Sir. Have a nice day then.
 
Vegetable Buyer: But if you sell your grouper or snapper for $1 per kg, or if you sell me the pomfret for $0.5 per kg, I will buy. Seriously, I will make sure I check the markets everyday until I find that price. Markets is so lousy now for sure you will beg me at those prices I quoted. Take it or leave it.
 
Fish Seller: ...

won't buy 1 year ago won't buy now , anyway plenty of margin calls coming our way.
 
Heard from my friends from banking and brokeages , blood bath is here! DJI and S&P limited down . Should be seeing "high" flyers soon.
 
That said , i would rather be the vege buyers than the fish seller now. So applies if you are having property.
 
What will happen , massive panic , everyone lost , get margin call , cuts everything , get saved . Those which didn't gets a further down movement which eventually forces almost all of them to have a massive loss , only for it to rebound in the upcoming days , those which fall for it will go through another round of terror thus wiping every cent they have out.
 
Result , foreclosures , force selling and massive job losses. Good luck trying to "tank" the drop. Fish will be selling at 1x per kg soon and for quite a long time .Recovery would slow and painful this time round.

Singapore’s Public Homes Incentives May Hurt Private Developers
 Pooja Thakur Mahrotri
August 24, 2015 — 5:00 PM EDT
 
 
 
Singapore wants to make public housing more affordable ahead of elections. That’s creating another headache for developers already under pressure from plunging sales and home prices.
 
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Sunday he’s boosting grants for public housing, where more than 80 percent of Singaporeans live. He will also raise the household monthly income ceiling to qualify for new units by S$2,000 to S$12,000 ($8,519) and to S$14,000 for more upscale executive condominiums to ensure homes are within reach for more of its citizens.
 
Developers are already grappling with falling prices and lower sales after the government began introducing residential curbs in 2009 as low interest rates and demand from foreign buyers raised concerns that the property market was overheating. More generous public-housing rules are likely to hurt demand from middle-income families who otherwise would have had to buy on commercial terms.
 
“The move will impact sales of mass-market private homes, which are already suffering from a loss in demand due to the property curbs,” said Donald Han, Singapore-based managing director at real estate broker Chestertons.
 
Monthly private home sales have dropped to about a third the level prior to the mortgage curbs in 2013, Han said. Mass-market homes account for about half the monthly sales. For Singaporeans who live in public housing, about 90 percent own their apartments, one of the world’s highest ownership rates.
 
More Pain
 
The latest moves to draw more people to subsidized housing are adding to the woes of developers already bracing for a tougher outlook. CapitaLand Ltd., Singapore’s biggest property company, said this month the government curbs will impact the market “for a while” and it’s not clear when the measures will be lifted. Its biggest rival, City Developments Ltd., said the operating environment in Singapore was expected to stay challenging in the near term.
 
Prices dropped for a seventh consecutive quarter in the three months to the end of June, the longest losing streak in 13 years, while private home sales slumped to a six-year low in 2014. The government’s curbs have included a cap on debt repayment costs at more than half of a borrower’s monthly income, higher stamp duties on home purchases and an increase in real estate taxes.
 
While the latest public housing sweeteners will soften demand for homes that appeal to typical buyers in the wider market, they will have little effect on luxury apartments, OCBC Securities said in a research note on Monday.
 
Bamboo Poles
 
“Given the government’s push to improve the affordability of housing for the middle-income group, we believe there may be some impact on the private mass-market segment but this should have little implications on the high-end segment,” OCBC said.
 
Government-built apartments, which are clustered throughout the island-state, tend to be blocky and unadorned, with laundry often hanging off bamboo poles outside. While private condominium owners have easy access to swimming pools, gyms and tennis courts, these amenities are commonly shared by entire suburbs of public-housing residents. Government units have restrictions on resale and rental, as well as a minimum occupation period.
 
Lee, who said on Sunday he will call for elections soon, also announced grants for families who are buying public housing units close to their parents. The incentives will prompt some eligible buyers to switch from the private market and consider government housing, said Vikrant Pandey, an analyst at UOB Kay Hian Pte in Singapore.
 
Steeper Correction
 
“The move will help boost demand for public housing, which saw a steeper price correction than private homes,” Pandey said. “There will be some impact on demand for private mass-market homes.”
 
Resale prices for homes planned and developed by the government’s Housing & Development Board, known as HDB, have dropped 9.6 percent since the third quarter of 2013, compared with a 6.7 percent decline in an index tracking private residential prices.
 
Lee’s ruling party is managing issues from rising costs to increasing frustration among citizens against an influx of foreign workers. The government has sought to shore up support among voters in recent years by boosting spending on lower-income families and the elderly after losing some districts in the 2011 ballot.

i say with higher ceiling for HDB means more demand for HDB so price will go up 
 
when BTO reaches $500K for 4 rm flat, EC will smelly smelly be $1,000 psf since income ceiling also go up
 
then private developer will be able to justify raising their mass market to $1,400 psf to $2,000 psf depending on location 
 
and govt continue to sell GLS land at $500 psf and above

Sometimes I would think , if the income cap is at 12 or 14k , what diff would it make since those aren't made for the general public , most of us would still be staying bto or hdbs earning a typical wage 3-5k per month, do you think those would be buying a EC?
 
The EC is just a project for wannabe higher middle income groups which the garmen wants to tap on get them to commit to a debt which would probably take them a long time to clear than if there are to buy normal bto.
 
How much the garmen prices would really depend on how eager they are in trying to win votes. It is a know fact that many are unhappy with all this mambo jambo about ECs and psf,look deeper and look at how much debt those people are putting themselves in.
 
An EC easily cost you 1-2 mil for a good location and good view, how long do you think a family household income of 14k will take to repay? Don't eat don't spend also need 10 years. 
 
Haha it is just a dream created for dreamers for something which doesn't create economic value. Those which keep thinking singapore will always remain expensive is in for a rude shock should our neighbors become competitive.
 
Agents nowadays don't walk around in the neighborhood and keep blowing their own trumpets on unrelated relationship to their perceived view of how prices should be , without knowing the cost of building one.
 
I cite an example 20 years ago a coffeeshop is sold for 2.5mil generates an income of 10k and up consistently on average for the past 20 years and eventually sold for 20 million nowadays vs an EC sold at 2mil ,do you think that is going to fetch you 20mil in 20 years ? Dude there is a science on relative affordability which you might wanna consider reading.

From what i know , there is a difference between residential and commercial but coffeeshop may include a residential 3 room , i think even in residential ,there is also a difference an investment grade property and one intended for own stay which you too failed to highlight. I am just replying based on whatever you implied. I am not in property either , to me as long as it is not my home , i take it point blank as an investment , no diff from commercial and residential.
 
It is just a matter of playing around with words.
 
That said , prices are relative to supply and demand and it's intrinsic economic value , you can't force someone to buy something which they can only afford 10 bucks for 50 bucks. But you can force a seller to sell at 10 even though he thinks it is worth 50.

Anyway by upping the limit , it actually allows border line cases to look into HDBs or public housing.
 
It might support the hdb prices near term but looking forward , it indirectly going to move demand from private away into public housing.
 
Thus , it is likely to have a bigger effect on private prices and coupled with the massive supply in the market and cooldown in economy , there might be a slim chance where private property prices might drop to hdb prices and in extreme cases , there might be a slim chance that they might even drop below hdb prices.
 
It has happen before and might happen again.

Will this might not be the intended effect but it actually might balance up and likely to let property prices drop back to realistic prices. 
The high prices in the past few years has being stiffling and totally not helping the economy as a whole as the entire workforce is forced to ask for a higher pay to compensate the higher cost of living. This indirectly affects our competitiveness and foreign investment and jobs are moving to cheaper places simply because of that.
 
A lower property price would actually benefit everyone over the the longer run than to keep prices high. It might affect idiots which got stuck but personally I think the speculators totally deserved it.

unlikely. Given at this income group is actually not here not there.
 
given a couple with average of 6.5k would be hitting this range.
 
Not alot , personally i would think given if i were in this income group i would prefer to buy a hdb than an ec or private.

The property agents already hard life, you still 落井下石.
 
You not scared later retribution Govt come up with Rolex tax?
 
OK lah to be frank I do feel that we need less real estate agents, maybe leave the better, the older and more experienced ones? Should channel the rest of those back to production line - we need more young people in many industries. Actually so far the employment loss I have seen are due to inability to get the staff to sustain the industry. According to the papers, the employment dip figures so far is mainly due to young workers leaving their work.
 
My opinions only.
 
Hold the CMs for a few more years - good. Relax the CMs - will be scary. Maybe marginally adjust the CMs? No one solution to satisfy all.

u believe redas? of cus they want to lift CM lah, then floodgate of money will be unleashed
 
govt announce unemployment 2% only lah, don't believe all these rumours of chop chop
 
just use common sense can liao to avoid confusion - cooling measure is govt intervention to keep market from overheating. if market is so jialat, what the F do u still need to intervene? just let market forces dictate the price lah
 
but of course, the govt knows the truth, which is there are still many ppl in SG hungry to buy their 2nd, 3rd or more property

What is new , credit card bills will soar as people turn to credit to tide over as they lose their jobs.
 
Lucky for the banks , they have limited the amount of credit they can issue to people , no more rolling. If wanna take debt make sure u take within one month.
 
- From June 1 this year, the limit will be 24 times the monthly income
- From June 1 in 2017, the limit will be 18 times the monthly income
- From June 1 in 2019, the limit will be 12 times the monthly income
 
Koodos on the job done by MAS , more can be done actually. Finally the papers worked. We shall see savings back in line and our future generations do not need to bear the debt created by us.
 
In view of this , it is more difficult for speculation on properties for locals. Property prices are likely top drop further in the near future.

Our PM said $1K salary can own a flat, so I guess $600k is considered cheap. Yes, we gave them strong mandate so mai complain.

I won't be surprised that those flats are bought by PRCs or PRs which I have clearly mentioned that those lot should not be allow to buy flats and should not benefit from an appreciation of prices. They artificially inflate the market to the point that the sellers become greedy and the below median classes are forced to pay horrid prices for a housing. This reduces birth rates and it is not consistent with whatever policies our stupid garmen is trying to show.
 
Congrats for buying at high prices for a flat <800k. That said , money is not "made" by HBD and they will consistently be complaining about "losses" , they also forget the "stamp" duty and "interest" they charge for the high prices those FLATS are sold at. People here gradually forget that property prices only a reflection of the current economy . I DO NOT BELIEVE Singapore has been consistent in their growth , in fact it is showing gradual reductions in productivity. But that said , there will be plenty of these "gurus" telling me otherwise. Personally i do not understand why something which only generated at most 300~400k worth of economic value would be worth anything in excess 800k and above.
 
Welcome to singapore folks. Buying a flat for more than 800k is not a show of wealth but a show of stupidity. It is meant to be public housing , not PRIVATE PROPERTY.

That said , money is not "made" by HBD and they will consistently be complaining about "losses" , they also forget the "stamp" duty and "interest" they charge for the high prices those FLATS are sold at. People here gradually forget that property prices only a reflection of the current economy . I DO NOT BELIEVE Singapore has been consistent in their growth , in fact it is showing gradual reductions in productivity. But that said , there will be plenty of these "gurus" telling me otherwise. Personally i do not understand why something which only generated at most 300~400k worth of economic value would be worth anything in excess 800k and above.
 
Welcome to singapore folks. Buying a flat for more than 800k is not a show of wealth but a show of stupidity. It is meant to be public housing , not PRIVATE PROPERTY.

How many times do u want me to praise u?

  $720K for a BTO?

 
Yes, double confirm. U can check hdb website of the BTO exercise I think 2 or 3 launches ago for the indicative prices. This however is the top floor of a 5room flat in a matured estate but nevertheless pricey!!

I won't be surprised that those flats are bought by PRCs or PRs which I have clearly mentioned that those lot should not be allow to buy flats and should not benefit from an appreciation of prices. They artificially inflate the market to the point that the sellers become greedy and the below median classes are forced to pay horrid prices for a housing. This reduces birth rates and it is not consistent with whatever policies our stupid garmen is trying to show.

Oh , don't worry , i am not , after traveling around Asean and few parts of Europe, there are plenty of places with better investment value and of better value. GE or not , doesn't matter to me , i am highly mobile i have properties in a couple of countries and easily move there if i wanted. That said , my home is still here in SG and i am concerned with the livelihood of my fellow country man which are unable to leave. I do have to highlight , 90% of those that are affected are not posting or reading forums here are suffering from failed oversight from our leadership.
 
The reason why i am trying to repeat so that people will keep in mind  on the what is actually going on. Do you think i can push down the market by trying to "stir shit" ?  Anyway whatever i have said don't carry weight. I am the resident troll here. I might sound angry but i am actually happy for my pockets as idoits bought my property at a high price. These are the ones suffering now along with plenty which over leveraged themselves thinking property prices will forever be on a uptrend. The ones thinking that prices will return back to a higher price will have to consider this. There is a gradual reduction in productivity and output and the garmen is trying to plunge the gap via massive imports. Only morons fail to see this and still think prices of yesterday peaks will be avaliable in the future with no vision of what we should be 10~20 years time. They have failed to look at opportunity cost along with loan interests.
 
Call me chek ark , but i am the least concerned with the greedy people , i made more than enough to last 2 lifetimes even if you factor inflation.

To be honest, I think it is rather a pity that a talent like you has left the working force in whichever field you used to be at. Possible to achieve great things for us. A loss for Singapore I feel.

Public not possible to drop 80K valuation in 6 months. That represents 10-20% valuation drop against a typical HDB.
 
The transactions in that development or area could be very thin and few over the last half year, so the one who bought at 80K lower benchmarked the valuation to 80K lower.
 
My guess is a Freehold condo or landed property in a prime area. Guess only. Best of luck.

Valuation and X-Value, they should be similar right? 
Sorry if I was not clear, I was checking the current X-Value of my place and it's at 80k less than the X-Value at the time I bought my place.

Different lah. Valuation report is what bankers refer to to lend.
 
X value is a good estimate but in the absence of recent data in the development it can be skewed down. Abundant data in the same development also might skew up the value.
 
"It is important to note that the X-Value and X-Trend are computer-generated numbers based on quantitative and geospatial data only. It does not take into account qualitative factors like the condition of the interior." From SRX. 
 
I suspect they also treat freehold the same as leasehold in the computer generation. New or old also treated the same.

When I called the bank to ask about valuation of my place to check for provisional loan amount, the valuation amount they gave is the same as the X-Value provided by SRX.
 
So I think they should be similar ba.
Anyway I'm buying for own stay so the figures are academic. Just that when I saw a recent transaction, 3 floors higher at the same price I got, I feel buay song haha

OK that is possible too.
 
But different banks can also value differently. Since your price might be one of the very few recent transactions it is possible they end up using yours as the valuation for your specific property.

You know why? You actually contributed directly to the drop in valuation.  Especially if there is not much recent transactions after yours.

haha rise or drop i don't care , i don't see blood i dont believe.
 
Soon , private might go cheaper than public making the ruling party eat their words yet again. More good times ahead?
 
With high paying and cushy jobs evaporating and an impending interest rate hike , see how long goons can continue to pay for their repayments. Guess alot of downgrading happening soon. Wonder how much a divisional director of a property company is making now?
 
Personally i would think there will be a time when the hawkers would end up earning more than the office workers , while i think it is perfectly fair and the garmen should reduce taxes on those which sweat blood to deliver good food , indirectly , it allows people to move into areas where education is less important. Thus having more job creations .
 
Redundancy in office jobs are plenty , goons will cut each other out to keep their jobs , business will collapse because of these goons as the able will move out , if the garmen wants to open up entrepreneurship now is a very good time. Time to think how to help by reducing rentals for businesses.
 
Help the SMEs to bloom , you will see employment back , continue to rely on idoits running the show  , soon u will only see a city filled with past glories .. no innovation , ZERO opportunities. Innovation don't come from books.

Developers and analyst ARE ALREADY screaming , lest you dont realise.  
Prices dropping albeit not as much on overall basis but with sale stagnating and inventory stockpiling, the only way is down.
 
$1700psf Yishun? KNS. Mickey mouse lah!  Please...
 
Show me $1700psf for a decent 3 room 1200sft size in Yishun, then i congratulate you with a bottle of champagne.

I don't think lowballing helps her. Because if below cost she has to top up the difference also, which she does not have.

Gross development value is above 55 million but people already low balling at 22 million, can try lah.
 
However, Ms Lee said in an affidavit that she has found offers for Devonshire 8 at prices of $25.8 million to $31 million - higher than the $21.98 million that an unnamed party recently offered the provisional liquidators. "It is clear (the firm) would be better able to realise the value of Devonshire 8 than liquidators would in the event of winding up."
 
Three valuation reports have put the value of the property at about $25 million to $31 million, while another marketing proposal by Savills estimated the gross development value of the project to be $55 million to $60 million, she said.

Issues of stagnant sales is attributed by expectation not in line...developers want to sell high while buyers, esp investors are expecting price drop. price drop will only be trigger when some developers need to liquidate due to cash flow issue. Matter of time the stalemate will tilt to one side. Which side? Likely in favour of buyers.

Too near AYE and not that near Clementi. 
 
The other sides face the schools and church which can be neutral or negative if too near (noises and vehicular flow)
 
Plus current overcast about the supply. But the TOP must be in 2020 so supplies might be low by then? 
 
I think will still have minimum bid at 500+ PSF and final selling price of minimum 1.2kpsf.

The only interesting thing is the recent HDB BTO and SOBF launches.
 
I didn't realise Bidadari is classified as a Mature Estate. I always thought it was a mature cemetery but new estate.

it has been inhabited by human remains for a long time already. i guess that is HDB's definitiion
 
or maybe whether it is mature or not depends on price.

I think maturity is defined by distance from city centre. Districts 1 to 15 all mature, ripe for harvesting.

23% (ordinary account contribution rate) x $4k (median salary, cap at 5k for many years) x 15 months (3 months bonus) = $13,800. About 20 years to get to 250k.

Cannot talk up so talk down. Agents don't really care whether market is going up or down as long as there is no expectation gap between buyers and sellers, there will be transactions.

It is to prevent the poor from getting into too much debt.

One other way to look at it is most of the CMs are in a way taxing the more affluent or capable with spare cash and earning capacity. 
 
SSD of 4 to 16%. ABSD of 7% or 10% or higher.
 
I really think the TDSR is the most effective having turned the tide only in 2013 but the report says SSD and ABSD are the most effective. 
 
I guess the conclusion in this case is that there are still many who can clear TDSR but do not want to pay ABSD or SSD.

i cannot imagine the mayhem that would be unleashed once ABSD is lifted. Prices will go up 10-20% minimum  
 
i would recommend the govt introduce more CM, cos the market is freaking hot!

Buy and sell is one strategy.
 
But that type has more or less sold for a while or stayed out of market for a while since risks spiked.
 
My interpretation for most current buyers' profile is buy and stay, or buy and hold type for at least 5-10 years or more.
 
The BSD is already 3%. Unless one has confidence to earn 6% (factoring in second buyers' BSD, I don't think buy and sell type will dare to commit. Nobody dares to even predict a flat market going forward in the near term of 2-3 years,  much less to say gain of 6%.
 
To get buy and stay or hold type to sell, need recession plus loss of jobs.

To sell at 1.1m in your case is losing money hor.
Don't forget all other legal fee, bank interest, agent fee, this fee, that fee hor .....
i would say u can't sell at 1.5m, u better keep quiet(of cos not saying you ah...) and keep servicing your loan better....

They can remove absd or whatever stamp for all i care,  thats never my debate anyway.
 
Just put in at least minimum 50% down in cash otherwise tiam tiam lah.
Knn, cant even down $1m - $2m cash, invest simi lan property.    Pwui!
Yes that would be an effective one to add. 50% down or forget it.

Bro T2, what you propose is already in place for 2nd property loans for some time now.
 
http://www.mas.gov.sg/~/media/resource/news_room/press_releases/2013/Annex%20II.pdf
 
For upgraders, many actually also meet the 50% downpayment when they sold the first property.
 
Only first time buyers are allowed a higher LTV. Overly stringent LTVs will affect them most badly. Even getting the HDB they aim for might be a huge stretch.

Not only second property.
Any property except HDB 3 room and below. 
 
Moreover CPF not to be used for property except for amounts over and above minimum sum at point of purchase.

not entirely true ... why people feel T2 logic will deprive a lot of people to buy home including hdb 4-5 room flats
because hdb is fking expensive ... the affordability is stretched until a person need to work drop dead with 25-35 years loan with little sum in cpf at old age
if T2 logic kicks in ... it means a lot of people cannot afford home even for big hdb flat
this will make govt to relook into their pricing and making affordable hdb
once hdb is affordable ... peasants will have more $$ in the cpf
what's the point of buying 4-5 hdb flat when one has to exhaust all his including spouse cpf
$1M hdb flat is also cheap if one is allowed to take 100 years loan and pay 10% downpayment
 
$250K flat pay 50% downpayment ($125k)
$500K flat pay 20% downpayment ($100k)
which is more jialat for buyer in terms of downpayment and pay for the house from a long term view perpective
and what the hell is govt making $500k hdb public housing
is there any country in the world has public housing cost 1/2 a million?
if private property ... i couldn't care less if it cost $5M a pop
just like i'm happy for PRC to buy sentosa cove for $28M as long as taxes are paid
 
and the current generation feels $500k hdb is "cheap" ... somemore what you want
for the same size unit ... private costs > $1M leh ... so it's 50% cheaper liao (and that's govt telling us using market pricing comparison) ... buy lor ... what to do
 
and why a mickey mouse condo cost > $1M? because hdb is $500k ... that's the base line already
spore being the most expensive city in the world is for a valid reason

We shouldn't just stop at T2's CM of 30-50% LTV for 1st home. We should make loans illegal and crash the banking, the housing and the cars sectors.
 
Then China / HK middle and upper class can come over and buy up everything we have in full cash.
 
But make sure we do not complain when they come over.
 
Unless we also add another clause that foreign buyers have to pay 100% stamp duty to ensure these are reserved for Singaporeans.

2. You may still lose if you own a lot of properties and nobody rents and you hv no or low cash
3.  Luck matters
4.  You have a better chance of winning when you buy good properties

gotta love all these headlines with "loom", sounds so ominous
 
however, please rem that it is a well known fact that if you build it, they will come
 
anyone remember the doom and gloom back in 2007 when experts are calling out oversupply in raffles place after 2010? 
 
millions of sqft of prime grade A office. Who will occupy??
 
in the end, all 90+% occupancy    
 
 
  OVERSUPPLY LOOMS IN S’PORE OFFICE SECTOR: CITIGROUP
 
It downgrades two stocks with key exposure to sector – KepLand, CityDev
 
SINGAPORE is in danger of seeing an oversupply of office space from 2010 onwards, Citigroup is warning.
The bank’s research unit has also downgraded two Singapore stocks with significant exposure to the office market here – Keppel Land and City Developments.
‘The market is underestimating the potential supply of new office space in 2010 and beyond, in our view,’ said Citigroup analyst Wendy Koh in research report dated Monday.
‘Based on our estimates, occupancy rates are likely to peak in 2008-09 and decline thereafter with the impending supply.’
Since May 2007, six new sites with a total gross floor area of 5 million sq ft have been awarded amidst fears of an office space crunch. These sites could add some 3 million sq ft of new office space in 2010-11, Citigroup estimates.
Altogether, on average, 3.2 million sq ft of new supply could hit the market from 2010-12, the bank said. This compares to a historical average demand of 1.5 million sq ft per year.
Supply estimates could rise even further with more government land sales in the first half of 2008, Citigroup said.
All this will mean that buildings in core Central Business District will be competing for tenants.
Key projects that are scheduled to be completed in 2010-12 include Marina Bay Financial Centre, the redeveloped Ocean Building One Financial Centre and the South Beach Road and Marina View land parcels.
In response, Citigroup downgraded its ratings on office landlords Keppel Land and City Developments.

gotta love all these headlines with "loom", sounds so ominous
 
however, please rem that it is a well known fact that if you build it, they will come
 
anyone remember the doom and gloom back in 2007 when experts are calling out oversupply in raffles place after 2010? 
 
millions of sqft of prime grade A office. Who will occupy??
 
in the end, all 90+% occupancy    
 
 
 
OVERSUPPLY LOOMS IN S’PORE OFFICE SECTOR: CITIGROUP
 
It downgrades two stocks with key exposure to sector – KepLand, CityDev
 
 

 

 
Oversupply in office space?
 
That's the best news for us.
 
Many companies keep complaining
 
office rent too high in Singapore.  
 
With lower rents more companies
 
will keep their offices here and that means
 
more jobs for us.

Lower HDB and private rents also help to manage costs for expats to continue to work here if wages are depressed.

The best thing we can do to help our economy
 
is to replace the expensive expat and do the jobs ourselves.
 
I am learning to bs and talk nonsense but I have to admit
 
I am still not up to the level of a lot of expats yet.
 
But I am practicing hard and its only a matter before
 
I get there.

Since this topic started in Aug 2013, there is no sight of a property bubble yet in Singapore, and we are now in 2016.
 
But judging from the past bidding of land sales by developers in 2015, prices are still holding up well for good sites. 
 
Example 1:
Alexandra View (Parcel A) - Tender closed 12 Nov 2015.  $851 psf ppr.
Example 2:
Siglap Road - Tender closed 14 Jan 2016.  $858 psf ppr.  
 
Assuming a breakeven price of $1,300, the units' launch price could be set at $1,480 psf or above. 
 
In short, developers have full confidence in our local property market, and believe that they can make a decent profit, even after putting high bids for land sales.

Not only did the government used cooling measures, they also control the release of land sales. In 2012, 19 residential land sales were released.
 
But from 2013 to 2015, the numbers were 9, 9 and 7 residential land sales respectively.  This is to prevent a potential oversupply situation from 2018 to 2020, as they foresee a slowdown in take-up rate. 
 
I will say that their timing is just right, since there is currently an unsold inventory of 23,271 units.  This will probably take 3 years or more to clear, and the completion of the units arising from land sales in 2013 to 2015 complement this. 
 
Those people in URA are looking carefully at the property market all the time and ensuring that private residential supply does not spike up too abruptly to cause a collapse of the property market i.e. property bubble.

Just in case, you fellas still living in cuckooland.
 
Many D9 properties are at 2010 prices with no buyers.
 
Some examples
 
Inspira going at $1600psf was $1850psf++
Watermark going at $1700psf was $2000psf++
Rivergate going at $1800psf was $2000psf++
Langstonville going at $1250psf was $1500psf++
Waterscape going at $1750psf was $2000psf++
 
Plus many many more.......
 
Many older ones are going below $1500psf when they used to be $1800psf at peak
 
Some are a bit more resilient but still easily 10 to 15% off.
Note that prices are not even negotiated yet which mean you can easily take another 5% off.
Note also that these are either freehold or 999yrs.
 
First timers who can afford, lucky you!
A bona fide 3 bdrm 1250sft condo for about $2mil in D9 is not bad.
For investments, its a different story altogether becos rental still sucks.
And selling within first few years is a confirm loss with sellers stamp......
 
Wooohooo...

Let me add a little bit more on the rental market to augment your post.
 
The high end rental market (read Financial Centre district and the likes) has seen an exodus of expats to the more traditional expat condos (read: Bayshore, River Valley type condos) outside the city. Rent for units in The Sail (for example) has dropped at least 10% over the last year and is continuing to drop. I overheard certain high floor bay view units going below $4,000 a month which is an extremely tasty price.
 
And of course the downward trend can be felt in the suburban condos especially the new ones. Prices are slowly but surely dropping. Landlords who ask exorbitant rental or selling price can go f*ck themselves. Really! Please wake up your idea and start dropping unless of course you can afford to hold and Muayhahaha at those bargain hunters because you full cash like our brudder Throttle here.

Old units sure got discount. Already huge maintenance costs going higher and higher. 
 
Newly built units got discount bo after 7% tax by Govt? That is the question nowadays. The young people nowadays don't quite care about Freehold or 999 especially for rentals to be honest.

Thanks, not interestedPrecisely the phrase I want to use for those units you mentioned. Other than price, age is one big reason why certain developments have no buyers. Waterscape is new though. 
Why buy a property to sit when you can buy one to actually enjoy?
 
But actually I run through the actual lodged caveats in URA. The numbers differ hugely from those claimed. Actual caveats lodged do not show a difference in prices from 2013.

Most likely you have fallen for the oldest trick in the book in property portals. Units with incredibly low price to entice and get your contacts. Why don't you give some of the numbers a call?

I need to correct a misconception.  Marketing gimmicks. 
 
 
Today's Straits Times advertisement.  Waterscape, selling from $1,750psf.  This means the price is for the cheapest unit, not the average.  The psf spread could be from $1,750 psf to >$2,100 psf. 
 
Actual recent transactions (source: URA website) done in Mar 2016 for Waterscape: 
 
1,561 sq ft unit at $2,018 psf.
1,216 sq ft unit at $1,882 psf
 
Actually, there are still buyers.

There will always be buyers
There will always be sellers
 
In 2013, waterscape asking $2200psf++
Now if $1800psf before nego is about right.
Straits time price is list price. 
Nobody pays list price
 
see who blinks first.
I am not. 
 
All the best to buyers.
Sellers good luck
