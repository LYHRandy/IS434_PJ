Don't you think searching here will give you better information on finding a property rather than a car forum?

If the budget is less than 2000psf.. there is quite a few along bukit timah. 

Cascadia for one is less than 1 yr old. MRT is going to be nearby. 

It has olympic size pools plus alot of smaller play pools. Tennis court, basket ball court etc

One 4 bedrm unit is now selling for <1200psf.

i wonder the current high price of condo is "overpriced" (assuming 10%-15% correction) or become "norm" liao, which means no >$1M no sell
