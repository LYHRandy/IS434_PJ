quite normal if u dun use the oven often. 

What  u can do is to remove the earth cable on ur oven plug. 

Then plug in and turn on the oven for abt 5 min. Open the door for a while. DO NOT HOLD ANY METAL PARTS ON THE OVEN.

Then power it off and connect back ur earth wire.

Use the oven as per normal.
 

If cannot ...need to change oven already.

Yes, your oven isn't being used as often as it should. The heating element is the issue, because it absorbs moisture, and thus that trips the power. 

What you can do is slowly heat it up from a lower temperature, to dry the heating element, after this, turn on your oven every 2 weeks, to keep the element dry and this trip will not happen again. 
 

If you haven't used it for a VERY VERY LONG while, then you would need to replace the element, price range is round $80-$120 direct from your oven agent. 
 

What I did last time was put in a small little furnace, with a few pieces of red hot charcoal embers, left it in the oven door open for 45mins or so,

that dried out the element and things started working fine again.

Did anyone regret installing the built in oven?
 

I'm worried about furniture wrapping....so I want to have the oven as a separate appliance sitting on the kitchen top (can keep if seldom used).  And they are quite cheap to replace the whole thing rather than having a built in oven, you'll always have to repair (costly) and since other brands might not fit in the same size ......
 

Any comments / experiences to share?

i am rather happy with my convection oven. it is smaller, lighter, consumes less electricity and mobile. Of course the sizing is smaller. An alternative to people who don't want to have a cavernous conventional oven especially when you consider that most kitchens today are tiny.

Had the same issue, didn't go for the built in,Had a oven and stove, and also a small electric oven,Cheaper and easier to maintain. Spoil, dump andGet a new one. Inbuilt, you have issues of the heat.And yes, the size is a bitch if you need to replace.

Daiso. Grab the largest charcoal deodorising/dessicating package you can have. Maybe 3 or 4 depend on the cc capacity of your oven. Leave them in the void of your oven when not in use. Got to sun the charcoal every month and change it altogether every 6 month.

Seems like oven tripping is common in Singapore! 
 
My Bosch oven tripped last week and I got it repaired by this service provider. Very professional and has a solution for this. Highly recommended to contact them at www.mexif.co or can pm me if contact number required.

 
warm the oven once a week for 10minutes is a routine for most ovens.
Moisture will appear on the heating element that causes the oven to trip.
