I just wanna do some research for renovation.
 

would appreciate if ppl who have experience share with me some issues on costing.
 

basically i have been told that marble flooring is very expensive. exactly how expensive is it? 
 

i have been told it can be as cheap as under $10k for the whole house. i wonder if its true. i also have been told that it could cost up to $30k just for that. as it depends on the grading of the marble. 
 

so basically how expensive is it? like marble vs. homogeneous vs. normal ceramic vs. lets say granite. (is there other choices ?)
 

appreciate alot!

they sell by per piece or per feet.... so it depends what you need..... 
 

too many variables.... for eg: big or small and the different types....
 

i know my friend did up his whole house for less than $40k (appliances not included).. including marble flooring for master room and living room... kitchen not very sure
 

i would recommend you go tile shop to ask... to have a clearer picture

marble got many diff grades and type etc..
 

some like ferrara or fiorentino etc are more exp... for 110sqm approx 20-30k
 

some are pretty cheap...
 

even same type of marble also got grade diff due to colour etc some got porosity ... so need to get a trusted contractor to help check throughly..
 

otherwise once installed then LLST
 

also keep a couple of pieces spare handy in the store room... might be useful in future....

marble also depend from which countries you choose from .....
 

Italian marble is more expensive than China or any other neighbouring countries. Its also depend on the type of pattern and colour. I did my whole house Italian marble (hall, 4 rooms & storeroom) for 28k in 1988 which is equal to $22/- per piece of 1' by 2'. The shine had last me for the past 22years.
 

Laying natural marble also depend on your contractor expertise & skill as you will never get a same pattern for every each marble pieces. 
 

You might like to try homogeneous tiles of marble pattern of which, the pattern are the same for every pieces. Nowadays, the homogeneous tiles comes in various sizes like the 1' by 2' or the 2' by 2'. Compare to marble, homogeneous are much cheaper by more than 50%.

don't marble the whole house. zone your home using different materials eg marble for living/dining, parquay (typo?) for bedrooms for a more cozy feel, and non slip homo for kitchen and bathrooms.
 

marble and granite are porous so you need to know that if there is spillage and is left there for some time, the floor will be stained and cannot be easily removed. You will forever have a visible stain mark depending on the colour of the marble/granite. 
 

Marble = no grout lines which is a nice feeling to the feet and of course no ugly and dirty grout lines later on.

the other materials all have grout lines.
 

Marble is damn hard so if a toddler falls and hits the head, damn freaking painful.
 

Marble = very slippery when wet so if got old folks, pls take care.
 

Marble = swee when highly polished. But over time, there will be many faint scratches which will tarnish the shine and gloss which means repolishing which is damn sian, messy (remove all furniture and they use water in the polishing process which means your wooden custom made furniture will kanna) and costly (11 years ago I did approx $2000 for whole house except kitchen).
 

Marble = cool feeling to the feet even during hot weather. Shiok!
 

Big house use big pieces very swee. Small house use big pieces make the house smaller. 
 

You know got artificial/man-made marble? Almost same price as real marble but you can control the colour and pigmentation (you can't control the colour, streaks of real marble). All other characterisitics are the same as real marble.
 

there are some tile shops at balestier road (near to the Thomson Medical Centre end) which you can go look see look see. Not sure if they have marble though. Nearby got a laksa shop (inside an old kopitiam) there very nice. Good for a light lunch. $3 only. LTA parking lots. Free after 5pm and on Sun.

Now I don't think got $28k for a house your size liao. Easily $40k I guess.
 

And workmanship is very important. Nowadays, less people lay marble means less pool of skilled workers means higher chances of slipshod work.
 

Take a look at the homo tile. It comes in a variety of sizes, shapes, colour, texture, gloss, matt and price. Cheaper too. Only bad thing is that it has grout lines.
 

If you intend to stay 5 to 10 years then sell, don't waste money on marble. Won't fetch you a much higher price one.

Infact its a matter of ur preference & if the material matches other finishes of the reno. Marble , granite r natural stone tat come in many different quatlity....oso country of origin & the natural grains make a whole lot diff in $$$..

Marble which is a weaker stone & more porous as compared to granite, chances of having water, oil or other liquid substance absord into it is high.

However, marble have got better grains & color.

Pricing for natural stone very much depends on the size of cut, grains & color, country of origin as mentioned. So is very much abt wat u want & how much u willing to throw in.

Standard 600 x 600 r most commonly used

Just personal Opinon. didn't try it before.
 

Epoxy is some type of plastic right? if so, i will have the impression that it is going to be very hot. and if kenna hot water or somthing, will give birth to air bubble.

my fren got it from gucca, at masai.. has few branches
 

i got it from a casa lifestyle, a small shop at taman austin..... 
 

milan is more establised but more expensive too...
 

lighting can get opposite sentosa.... this shop was recommended by a datuk's daughter.... quite cheap.. curtains is 2 shops down too....
 

take note when buying leather seats or sofas... be it in SG or MY... they always claim full leather but it is actually leather bond... this are small pieces of leather recycled and bonded together.. it cracks easily...
 

leather bond is very smooth to the feel as compared to real leather

6 years ago, I bought all my furniture back in my hometown in Johor too. 

- 1 queen size bed set (comes with a queen size wood bedframe, 4 door to-the-ceiling wardrobe, make-up cabinet with marge mirror, 1 side bed cabinet).

- 1 additional same 4-door to-the ceiling wardrobe

- 1 nyatoh super single bed with another pullout bed underneath

- 1 3+2+1 fabric sofa + glasstop coffee table with 2 drawers

- TV cabinet with glasstop

- 1 solid wood shoe rack cum place to put wallet, keys, etc

- 1 6 seat dining table with glasstop with 6 chairs

- 1 solid wood side dining cabinet

- 1 cabinet with ceramic top as a place to prepare milk for my then baby girl.
 

6 years liao, the sofa still solid despite my children climbing around, except that some of the corners, the fabric torn. Dining table top got scratch mark. Rest is OK.....
 

Total cost: about 16K RM.

yeah. that the problem. They try to copy Condo. but dont forget. Condo tend to be bigger in size. (not saying about those small size one lah) so that corridor still okay. but not for HDB especially those 4 room type. Living room already very small liao, still loss some more space to a corridor.

Ceramic texture tend to be uneven with certain patterns, designs and thus therein their attractiveness for the living room floor. Hw in the kitchen, those unevenness will tend to make cleaning harder as the dirt together with kitchen grease will get trapped in the grooves and uneven texture etc. Your mop will clean the top surface but will not "dig" in to remove the oil/dirt in the sunk in texture. Same for those non slip tiles. They are non slip because the surface is textured and textured surfaces trap dirt/oil more easily.
 

Ceramic when the surface is chipped, will show their red clay inner "underwear" which is unsightly unless your ceramic tiles are of the red/orange hue. Most folks tend to drop kitchen ware more in the kitchen than in the other rooms so you increase the probability of a chipped unsightly tile. Homo matt in a way, being colour homo from surface through the thickness of the tile, tends to hide any chip more easily than ceramic. But homo if not laid properly, may be rough at the tile edge as the edge is corner-ed vs ceramic with a rounded edge. My homo tiles got chipped before from a fallen tool. Hardly noticeable.
 

All the tiles got pros and cons. Depends on your lifestyle when you make the choice. The tile shops should be able to advise.

TS,
 

What is your budget for doing up the flat totally?  This would include renovation, furnishings, air con, lighting etc.
 

If on a tight budget, try not to consider marble or granite.  The $ you save using cheaper flooring e.g ceramic tiles could be spent on more built-in wardrobes, nicer furniture, whole house air con etc....

You be the judge lor.... I'm sure China should be even cheaper. However, how easy is it to buy? Just see the catalog and buy? No need to see the real thing? Go there is still an expenditure right? If got reliable kang tao, I'm not surprise it'd be a better deal.

If thats the budget you are looking at, i suggest you skip marble. homogeneous is a good replacement. but if you insist on having marble, den you have to put in effort to shop around and ask. 
 

like a lot mention, diff origin and types has v diff price range. for some suppliers, they supply a lot to projects (condos etc). if they do, try to ask them if there is any leftovers from all this projects and see if the price fits your budget. but keep in mind, it is leftover cos it fails the initial rounds of selections. but u might get lucky and manage to pick out nice pieces.
 

as for the rooms, if you want a woody feel/look to it and laminate is not a option, try using vinyl flooring. 
 

for a new flat, 40k is a good budget if you spend wisely. 
 

good luck! have fun sourcing around!

Then I suggest you look into the costs of built in wardrobes, kitchen cabinets, aircon(how many rooms?), hacking(if required)/false ceilings, feature walls, toilet fittings (bath tub needed??) and lightings first then see how much left for your flooring.
 

I am guessing not much...

Its is better you talk to few contractors and compare their prices. In this line is very competitive so you can choose the best one for you. 
 

Price is not everything, the workmanship is equally important. You can go and see the workmanship (those WIP project).
 

Some can promise you many things when you signed liao then many additional cost, like need to top up this and that. Its better to write doen black and white.

TS, setting up a home very expensive hor?   Lucky you in accounting line know how to count money.
 

If budget not enough, make sure to spend the money on things you cannot chin chai change one eg flooring, custom-made fixtures (if you have budget), toilet bowls, sinks, aircon, piping, windows. The additional moveable items like sofa, dinning table can get a cheaper version first or later if it bursts the budget now since you can easily swap it for a newer version later when you have more savings.

no. this contractor is the same one that had done my house flooring.
 

very good. for homo flooring, he can keep the floor tiles gap within 1mm. a bit slow though as he is using wet cement rather than the cheapo and easy to do dry cement. he check each tile 1 by 1 for wrapage before laying it down.
 

BTW, my dad marble flooring are source by himself and bought by himself. i think that itself will save on the markup.

good advice.

This reminds me of what happened to me.

When my wife and I started shopping for our home, the first piece of big ticket item we bough is a sofa.

We were window shopping at Park Mall for the idea on how to zheng our house.

The mall was very quiet because SARS had just killed the good doctor.

After spending 2-3 hours in 1 shop, the salesman was keep asking to buy their sofa. It was quoted as $5k and now selling at $3k.

We said no as too expensive. So, he asked how much are you willing to pay?

We were naive then, thinking, give them a ridiculous number so that we could go home. So, we said, $2k we will take. It is a 3+2 full leather Italian design sofa.

To our horror... they ok. That was how I got my sofa before collecting my home sweet home.

I bought my flat from the flooring sifu. He did the flooring himself. When I bought from him, I appointed him to change the tile in toilets as the previous one was smooth surface. He asked us to change as his wife fell a few times.

Now, 14 years already. My flooring is still perfect. None of the tile crack.

8k!!!if 100-120 sqm is quite ex liaoz..



 

Sorry its only the quotation for living room, 2mm thick of self leveling epoxy flooring...   I drop the idea liao... Hearsay its not easy to maintain the look... but i been to a minimalist showroom with white epoxy flooring, till now i still miss the look of it. With the right lighting and furniture, ur place will be remembered by all visitors to ur house. However till now i still dun understand why epoxy can be so ex, even marble also cheaper than epoxy...

Marble flooring is good for the feet leh. especially if you got those hardern skin at the sole. it will help you soften it.
 

No i am not joking, this one my mother experience it herself. Hard to believe but that is what she experience. 
 

(her first house after marriage is Ceramic flooring. then got that problem. then 2nd house is Broken Marble. problem disappear. 3rd house is Cermic flooring and Homo flooring. Problem come back.Now reno to Marble. so will see if really go away or not.)

I just wanna do some research for renovation.
 

would appreciate if ppl who have experience share with me some issues on costing.
 

basically i have been told that marble flooring is very expensive. exactly how expensive is it? 
 

i have been told it can be as cheap as under $10k for the whole house. i wonder if its true. i also have been told that it could cost up to $30k just for that. as it depends on the grading of the marble. 
 

so basically how expensive is it? like marble vs. homogeneous vs. normal ceramic vs. lets say granite. (is there other choices ?)
 

appreciate alot!

My parents first house.
 

3 Room in boonlay. less than 20K. give to his younger brother.(1973~6? to 1984)

4room(90sqm) in Yishun. Less than 50K Sold for 120K (1985 to 1993)

current 4 room (106sqm) in jurong around 150K. (1993 to present)
 

not rich. just a gradual increment.

Not sure anyway my father will be designing the house himself. the contractor will show us the ideal my father put forward maybe plus a bit of modification.
 

BTW, my next house likely to be design by myself too... 
 

saw a few designer make house. very nice... but not practical.

Its not that expensive. about the same price as Ceramic tiles.
 

(note that the design of a good ceramic tiles is only as good as the design of the homo tiles of the same price. but of couse design taste is subjective.)

i figure its alright.. we went to get some estimate quotes den before we sign option. was assured that kitchen and the store room flooring and wall would cost around 1k. 2 toilets around 1k. 3 bedrooms 1k each. assuming we use homogeneous.

so basically how expensive is it? like marble vs. homogeneous vs. normal ceramic vs. lets say granite. (is there other choices ?)
 

appreciate alot! 



 

If you want to save money on marble tiles. then get the tiles directly from the main marble suppliers, most of whom are located at Kranji. When I renovated my house, i visited at least 15-20 marble importers . Lots of work but can save quite  a bit. Get the contractor to quote you for laying the tiles.
 

For marble, whether source directly or through contractor , insist on seeing the actual crate . For the same type of marble, the grain and colour can vary from one crate to another. They can even lay out the tiles for you to confirm your selection. Don't just rely on the sample at the showroom.

anyone needs recommendation for a good contractor whom i have recently engaged ($7k for my reno including painting and 3 rooms change tile and 3 doors) and my bil also (for his new flat totally nicely done up at $50k, others quoted him $70k), pm me.  his price is significantly better than others upon comparison, and his workmanship is good.  i dont earn commision, but just want to do a favour for bros here renovating.  i already introduced bro bluepica liao and can ask him how is it.

Got a query about reno... any good, proven companies out there? I know much depends on the individual designer rather than company name. How about the quality of the finished job?
 

Anyone has experience with this company, darwin? Don't direct me to renotalk, cos I don't find the reviews very reliable.



 

I have worked with my reno contractor twice already.
 

Once 6 years ago when I got my EC. And recently when I got my new place.
 

www.dejenn.com
 

We had a very pleasant experience working with the lady boss the first time round so the 2nd time, we basically just approached her for our new place.
 

They are very helpful even after the renovation. 
 

The price is slightly higher than others I think.
 

pic of my first place done up by them

I posted this in xtremeplace forum (home theatre forum) 5 years back.
 

And I think my ID used the pic for some ID magazine last time.
 

She took pics of my current renovation too but I don't think she will advertise in magazine this time round anymore. I think she get her business from word of mouth alone nowadays.

Depend on the extend of your reno.... typically dont rush rush type will take about 5 weeks to 6 weeks..... unless cannot wait, else dont rush... do the house swee swee... it goes a long way... 
 

For my case, that time no choice, got to rush the CON-tractor..... imagine tomorrow need to move in, the house still like a CON-struction site....

Handsgrope? 
i call them 
 
a janet told me the nut might be loose
 
so i went to buy a wrench 
 
it still leaks
 
 
i call hansgrohe.  they say my pipe might be leaking. 
 
i told her my toilet just renovated less than 1 year
 
 
she says the industry promise of 5 years warranty is not valid
 
she says if after install. within 7 days no problems means ok
 
 
during the entire conversation.  she never admit that it her products fault .
 
 
dear friends.  dont buy hansgrohe products. they are expensive and offer zero warranty to the no brands mixers.
 
might as well save the monies and buy no brands than to buy expensive hansgrohe and still get sim lim sales man experience

IMO, it looks like the leaking is due to the joining part between the ring of the
fixture to the surface of the top. i think you need a rubber seal to seal the gap.

initially initially thought could be a simple fix change rubber seal or the flexi pipe. But he said 2 plumbers said the mixer got problem.

Sometimes what you need is some very high quality grease to lubricate the ringThe grease will also prevent leakage!
