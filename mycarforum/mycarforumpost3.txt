Looks like final fantasy but quite near reality
 
Heard the ghost township may have some injection of life soon. But mostly collecting dust at this point in time.
 
Maybe tempting to invest in a landed gated estate if I cash out on the HDB.

i went to this development some time this year.
 
the concept is interesting and luxury living.
ground floor greenery, while basement for traffic etc.
 
there's even a 3rd proposed custom whereby commuters travel by ferry.
Of course, its hearsay hearsay.
 
many of my Malaysian friends told me to avoid this project.
It's not cheap too, easily RM 1.5m for a small unit

Iskandar have a lot of better and cheaper project than this one. U buy this one if u like 9 outta 10 of ur neighbours to be Ah Tiong or worse, ghost town as most of them buy to park their $ with no intention of living there. Too big a project without much appreciation prospect. With the same $ buy any older project in or around JB town or even Iskandar is a wiser choice. Do some homework please b4 throwing good $ into bad projects like this one especially.

I think this places suits you to a tee. With the new capital outflow rule set by the PRC gov, you might just be able to grab a superb good deal, and very likely to have no neighbors ard you. Perfect Ghost town with no water and basic supplies.    
 
Cfm safe because no robbers will go rob a ghost town of no ROI, nobody use sure will not run down due to wear and tear. Best place to go for the idea of getting out of SG, faster faster mai tu liao.

if this is the case, you should wait and buy it when  the price drop by 50% in a few years time. For the same amount of money you spend now you can buy 2 units then.

You missed his point, he said that was the whole point of getting out of SGP.  So in your example of bad apple , he is after all out to buy bad apples, it is still cheaper to buy two bad apples for the price of one.

If a typical Hdb that is scheduled for SERS already have vagrant and drug addicts what more ghost town.. just that a bit newer that's all. If it's not expensive. I doubt people will buy. Hi f it's 1100sqft unit going for sgd 100k. But it's not the case
 
 Am sure will be taken up quite fast if super cheap and lower than 2 room Hdb prices

Forest City 
 
my humble opinion
 
Pros
cheap housing relative to Singapore
close to Singapore
Johore Sultan has a share
 
Cons
4 islands to be built with expected 700000 population - where to find customers, most Malaysia cannot afford and if can afford rather stay else where
project suppose to span over more than a decade - a lot of things can go wrong including companies going bankrupt
Johore government already say not going to supply water as their own needs not sufficient - maintenance fees would be high
politically not as stable as wish for, still got racial issues
policy changes with different administrations which would mean more expensive property tax for foreigners (need to increase revenue for social spending) and toll charges
developer paying lorryload to fly Chinese mainland and stay in 5 star hotels to woo them to buy - somebody has to pay for all these, so in a way over priced property
 
 
personally, I am sceptical about about the project, too huge and too ambitious project

With that kind of prices, unless all the civil servants has a pay adjustment similar to Singapore, the take up rate going to be dismal.

FC is not a small development 
it is huge and a city within a city
involves CHINA 
billions and billions of investment will be poured in over the next decade
it provides employment for the country 
investment eg hospitals, schools. technology and etc are pouring in
Sultan of JB has a huge share and he has a huge say when dealings on his land
 
given all these circumstances, it is unlikely that PKR will do a CLOB style. It would be suicide for the administration

He is posturing for better deal. What are the terms of this deal will be away from the public eyes.
Malaysia still has the Malaysia 2nd Home program.

I suspect the deal country garden was "too good"
 
like what Dr M did with HSR, he is doing it again with country garden to squeeze something back
 
 
we cant really blame Dr M because he is doing to benefit Malaysia as a whole
 
nothing is fair and we can say deal signed by last adminstration
 
then why dont we look at ourselves
 
deal signed for withdrawal of our CPF at 55 as promised by last adminstration (old guards) but new adminstration suka suka change
 
 
then you say Malaysia cannot like that but SG can with her own people

so he not happy
under Najib everything boleh! With mahathir sure cannot get good deal.......he is shrewd just like our old man. Nonetheless, he is saving MY from external forces and trying to get a upper hand in deals gave out by the previous administration. Bet the Sultan of Johor wont be happy with this new revelation........he has his hands in the cookie jar!

I am also confused by this line.... 
 
The stock, which had risen by as much as 3.9 per cent earlier on Monday, returned almost all of its gains for the day on the Hong Kong exchange after Mahathir’s comments were published, ending the day 2.5 per cent higher at HK$12.14.

Having said that, China govt also don't want further capital flight, so they might not care.

Country Garden issued a "statement of clarification" following Mahathir's comments, saying that Forest City has "complied with all laws and regulations with the necessary approvals to sell to foreign purchasers". 
 
The company added that it was "in touch" with Mahathir's office for clarifications, saying it believed his comments were "taken out of context in certain media reports" as they "do not correspond with the content" of his meeting with Country Garden chairman Yeung Kwok Keung.

Even if he is wayanging, It feels good if I am Malaysian hearing it.

For Malaysia, there is always a dozen backdoors open.
 
But after you stare at the front door already so scary and you did not commit, who dares to enter their backdoors? Not normal Singaporeans that's for sure.
 
 
That would be a more politically acceptable way than slamming the door.Maybe there is a back door that no one knows about.

In Jeju island they sold condos to mainland Chinese thinking it would be good for the economy.
 
The mainlanders moved in and only shop in shops owned by mainland Chinese and eat in
 
restaurants owned by more mainlanders and profits from these business are shipped back
 
to the mainland. So how do the locals benefit from this? They don't.
 
  
 
Instead of selling them condo they should have only allowed them to stay in hotels and resorts
 
on a short term basis so they spend money in shops owned by locals and eat in restaurants own
 
by locals.

Many factors could affect forest City.
 
Already before laoma came back to power, China already not too happy with so much money flowing out of china and pouring into FC, so I wont be surprise XJP got something to do with what Laoma did. 
 
another thing is, with a projected more than 1 million PRC Chinese going to stay in FC, it will become a "rich chinese village", if all become citizen and all gets to vote, they can really become a determine factor, not very healthy for a Malay ruling country. 
 
But if FC is mostly sold to SG, laoma will say pls come pls come..

Buying an apartment in Forest City
I have recently purchased an unit in Forest City. It is 1,200 sq and cost about SGD 450,000 or about $400 psf. This is 20% more expensive than high end apartments in Puteri Harbor but is about one third of the price in Singapore. 
 
I know that it is difficult to find a tenant or to sell my unit in the future, because there is massive over supply of apartments in Iskandar. 
 
I was surprised that the apartments are selling quite well. I was earlier offered two apartments of 1,800 sf. I did not confirm it within 1 week and they were booked by other buyers. 
 
I did not mind. My wife said that 1,800 sf is too big. So, we opted for the smaller size apartment. 
 
An experience property agent who markets apartments in Puteri Harbor told me that Forest City has developed much better than most people expected. The sales reported by Forest City came from real buyers.
 
There is restriction on transfer of currency from China to Malaysia, but the buyers from China found a way to get round the restrictions. So, the sales have resumed.
 
I also read a report from Hong Kong that China had relaxed some of the restriction, but the details are not clear. 
 
One advantage of Forest City is that it is half hour drive from the Second Link. There will be a separate CIQ which will reduce the clearance time. This makes Forest City a good choice for a second home or a holiday home.
 
The developer planned to bring an international school, a hospital and other business activities to Forest City. If they materialize, it will be good for Forest City. But they do not, Forest City is still an attractive concept.
 
If you have some spare money lying uninvested and wish to visit Forest City, you can contact me at kinlian@gmail.com.

In some other countries, developer comes in, buys the land then the govt suddenly imposes an ABSD on their potential buyers with the stroke of a pen.
 
Any difference?  

It happened when Anwar was the finance minister before he was sacked by Mahathir. He introduced RM100K levy on properties bought by foreigners retrospect 2 years!
sakali Madhatter say return all the money from the project 1st then redo all the contracts.....buyers lan lan. Returned money all go back China and with capital control it will be hard to sign another contract. Buyers go lawyers also lan lan..........
He bo lui liao how to return money? The only things he can return are agreements!

This is how they market the Forest City in China. does not go well for both Beijing and KL.
 

 
 值得一提的是，碧桂园森林城市一大卖点是中国买家子女可以低分上名校。在碧桂园森林公园的官网，一篇名为《十年苦读，不如一纸身份》的文章这样介绍森林城市的房子：
 
首付仅20万人民币，就能拥有一套永久产权的住房，同时也就意味着小孩成为华侨生，以“华侨”的身份回国参加联招高考，最大277分的差距，让人膛目结舌!
 
其中，北京科技大学、北京化学大学、中国农业大学等国内一流名校过400分就收。遗憾的是，每年华侨生考生都不屑于报考，华侨联考与国内高考的差距是：国内高考是学生挤破头皮跪求大学，华侨联考是考生挑来拣去选择大学!还等什么!赶紧为你的孩子未雨绸缪吧!

yeah i thought it would be quieter but not almost close to dead town on a friday. But i was wrong. Well it's good for us, cos it's quiet. But a bit too quiet lol  
I guess the legoland tour buses from SG servicing chinese/indian tourists just come in at 9-10am to legoland and leave at mid afternoon. That's why.
Even legoland the medini mall was mostly singaporeans/out of state malaysians/vietnamese with some PRC chinese having lunch.

No Belt, No Road, No Bedrooms in Malaysia for China
 
https://sg.yahoo.com/finance/news/opinion-no-chinese-belt-road-bedrooms-malaysia-012943779.html
 

 
Perplexed, wounded, indignant or still optimistic. The Chinese developer Country Garden Holdings Co. can put any spin it wants on its Forest City project, a $100 billion Malaysian township whose fate suddenly has been thrown into doubt after Mahathir Mohamad’s pointed refusal to let foreigners buy apartments or live in them long-term.
 
One thing is clear, though: The prime minister is not acting impulsively. The project claims to be a “new global cluster of commerce and culture,” and a “dream paradise for all mankind.” However, in Malaysian political discourse, Forest City is just a gigantic Chinatown of 700,000 residents. Taking on the developer is part of Mahathir’s broader plan to redefine Malaysia’s relationship with Beijing, pulling Kuala Lumpur away from the client-state mindset introduced by his predecessor.
Already, the 93-year-old leader has canceled the Chinese-funded East Coast Rail Link, dealing a blow to China Communications Construction Co., which was building the $20 billion belt-and-road route. Najib Razak, ousted in May, claimed the link would bring prosperity to eastern Malaysia. But Mahathir, who spoke bluntly in Beijing this month against “a new version of colonialism,” took a very different view of the railway, which would have connected areas near the Thai border along the South China Sea to busy port cities on Malaysia’s western coast, near the Strait of Malacca.

There's a new road built to access this new neighbourhood. It seems they are building some international schools along this road.
 
I use it a couple of times to get from the Medini area to 2nd Link, and I'm usually the only car on this road. Sometimes, the security guards standing along the road will even salute to my car.  [laugh]

I think one of the problems with this project is that they are building many times more units than the entire Johor population combined. There's no other way to fill these units other than selling to foreigners.
 
But then, the same could be said about many recent developments in 2nd and 3rd tier Chinese cities and far outskirts of 1st-tier cities. They are built on hope that people will move in from other provinces, pump a lot of money into advertising, throw in ridiculous free gifts like buy an expensive unit, and get a free 2nd apartment in some ulu town for retirement or retreat, whatever. Masters of property speculation.

Actually, it is a good concept.  Waterfront living that is "gated" (security) with a commercial element and best of all, its own CIQ (address the custom jam, a direct ferry to SG was reportedly contemplated).  If well executed, it could potentially become a Tuastosa for peasants like me when I retire (since I can't afford Sentosa, $400 psf for FH is cheap in comparison).  
But on hindsight, this is always going to be politically sensitive project due to its massive size.  I doubt many in SG can accept such an arrangement if our govt does the same, ie. allowing a Chinese or Indian developer to build an enclave on an island linked to SG mainland that can house 1 million (Johor state population is 3+ million) Indians or PRCs. 
 
The project will thus need to be scaled back. There is no way the local can afford to RM1,200 psf.

There's a new road built to access this new neighbourhood. It seems they are building some international schools along this road.
 
I use it a couple of times to get from the Medini area to 2nd Link, and I'm usually the only car on this road. Sometimes, the security guards standing along the road will even salute to my car.  [laugh]
I got lost when I went puteri Harbour. Cos I put the designation as the harbour itself rather than Thomas town. I spent ten mins driving down half completed roads on the other side of the harbour.

there are so many reasons why Dr M is doing this to Forest City after his visit to China
 
I wondered if Dr M was requested to plug the hole where China money is illegally finding its way outside of China via Forest City, in return China will re-negiotiate the China rail project.

FC is a long long term investment and I am not sure if you will ever 'profits from this investment simply due to depreciation of currency, investment opportunities and deterioration of quality.
 
Unless you will need to stay, you could also choose to rent, I don't see it as an investment. There are plenty of much better investment opportunities That is my view.

I remember I told you puteri harbour was real quiet, even on sat afternoon.  

 
 
  Yes sir, I went there ( Puteri Harbour ) twice and were utterly disappointed with the  lack of activities and promotion which the developer promises to bring in crowds, many shops were closed and some vacant.
 
  By night fall, maybe sitting by the restaurant sipping wine and resonating the yatches nearby is only a memories within, too quiet and nothing behold me to come back, i really pitied those investors who bought unit@Puteri

But in MY where MCST laws and regulations are not strong, many condos are not well maintained as a lot of SPs defaults on maintenance after a while. So the profile of the condo and their SPs are important consideration when buying.

Back in the early 2000s already I have seen so many project end up houses no body want. Just look at some of the early golf course projects like palm resort and pulai spring, I almost bought one unit because  that time I was crazy golfing.

Depends on if you are looking from shareholder or policy holder perspective. He and his people implemented policies which I got screwed. So till date I never had another ntuc income policy.

Even if I really want to retired in MY, it would still be in Johor, not in JB town, but wont be so far away to KL or Penang. I still want to come back and visit or make it easy for others to visit me leh.
 
Bukit Indah still attractive to me for its convenience and the type of population segment there. Otherwise I may move a little further up to Senai or Kulai, but that is about as far as it can get.

For the last 2 years I hv been seriously thinking of buying a house in JB, horizon hills or other landed place in JB, definitely not in Iskandar and definitely not FC. Poor SG who can't afford landed in SG always thinking of retirement in JB with a small garden in MY. However most of the places is just inflated to above 1 mio MYR for SG to buy becos of regulations whereas locals can buy same or similar places for 600k? To pay 40% more feels like Robert( no offence to pple with this name  ) This is wat put me off till now.
Y would I wanna to pay 'premium' to buy when the px is not 'rght'  However, looking at how our country is heading to, a lot of us may have to look to retire in another place to stretch our dollar.

The purpose is to be able to come back in the shortest time possible and yet enjoy paying a fraction of what we would have to pay here doing the same thing. 
 
BI is only 30 min drive less the jam, senai is 45 min, and kulai is about 60-90 min depending how far off.

Not really a fraction of what things cost here .... most to most cheaper by 40-50% at most even day to day grocery / electricity / fuel and be prepared to travel the longer distance; public transport.... nah ! Sucks .....Security ?? Walk in quiet area at night ??

I think we all know the potential security issues in MY.
Unfortunately singapore has no hinterland or areas to retire to cos it's just one city state.
 
It's just like it's difficult to retire in like manhattan in NYC. U have to move out to the surrounding burroughs or move to upstate NY. 

Few years back, they had a lot of news reports of late 50s-60s year old living in JB and coming back to SG as and when.

costing is a subjective topic, it depends on  ones expectation of cost. 
 
Already mentioned, 1-2 hrs drive is as far as it will get, so whats with the longer distance?
 
Public transport? already mentioned DRIVE, so who cares how the public transport sucks, they can also blow if they want to.
 
Security? which place in the world is totally secure? one will have to do his/her own homework.
 
walk in quiet area at night? why would an old man or old couple go walk in quiet area at night? if you ask for it, then there is no ground for complain. Quite simple isnt it?

Not really a fraction of what things cost here .... most to most cheaper by 40-50% at most even day to day grocery / electricity / fuel and be prepared to travel the longer distance; public transport.... nah ! Sucks .....Security ?? Walk in quiet area at night ??
 
Toyota Vios: SGD 80k; MYR 77k.
 
Toyota Hilux: MYR 126k will get AT, double cab, 7 airbags and cruise control.
 
Walk in quiet area at night is no diff from other big cities in the world.
 
No forgetting that Singapore is NOT real world.  HK feels more real than here.
 
Honestly, anywhere outside of Sg is NOT suitable for ppl w/o cocoon.

I think we all know the potential security issues in MY.
Unfortunately singapore has no hinterland or areas to retire to cos it's just one city state.
 
It's just like it's difficult to retire in like manhattan in NYC. U have to move out to the surrounding burroughs or move to upstate NY. 

Few years back, they had a lot of news reports of late 50s-60s year old living in JB and coming back to SG as and when.
 
Seems to be no longer featured in the media.

 
 
to be fair, I dont think there is really a place that is totally secure, even in safe heaven SG HDB flats, there are news of break ins. 
 
Security is also something we have to take charge ourselves. Like choice of where to stay, staying in a more reputable area. Buying a unit closer to the guardhouse, not exactly beside the guardhouse but mayb somewhere within sight. Choose not to stay near to the perimeter of the project, instead stay nearer to the core of the estate.  These are just some factors we can control with regards to security.
 
Since is retirement, surely there is no need to have a big car anymore, a small MY plate groceries getter is all that is require, so as no need to attract unnecessary attention. 
 
These are things we have to take charge ourselves, if ppl hve to compare it to what SG can offer, then the idea is not for them, they sld just stay put and be happy with it. Of course I am not saying i will surely retired in MY, in fact there is a very high chance it wont happen.   
 
aiya, those news now no value liao, so they leave the old folks alone to relac one corner lor..

costing is a subjective topic, it depends on  ones expectation of cost. 
 
Already mentioned, 1-2 hrs drive is as far as it will get, so whats with the longer distance?
 
Public transport? already mentioned DRIVE, so who cares how the public transport sucks, they can also blow if they want to.

well ok la. i run at late night. So i do enjoy the fact that u can wander around at anytime in relative safety.
So far i've not been to any part of malaysia where i don't think i can run without being worried whether i'll get knocked down by cars or have safety concerns

KL is beastly hot in summer. more like 37 deg compared to our 34-35. Makes singaporean summer look mild.

I dont know if you have been to one of those BI housing projects. Its like our landed houses with one entrance via the guardhouse, one round in the estate can easily clock 2-3km, so I think it is quite safe to run inside the estate, its just like running along the roads in our  landed housing estate here. Not many moving vehicles late at night and quite bright with lamp posts. 
 
Of course, even a demon like me wont run along any MY main roads or for the matter, any MY roads at night.

I also know JB residents who has never been robbed. But then, it's also a bit of luck and common sense and the neighbourhood one hangs out at. Still, JB is not known as the crime capital of MY for nothing. Actually, whether JB or not, the scary part is nobody (incl. polis) will help you when it happens. For KL and Penang, they are similar in this respect. Most SG are not used to thinking on the spot to handle such situation.

I have friends and relatives staying in Bukit indah, horizon hills, senai and kulai area, never heard they got rob. In fact in the villages of senai and kulai, robbers hardly get out standing when they are caught. 
 
JB town is a cowboy town, go there for entertainment yes, stay there is a total NO NO lah..

Public transport is rubbish. Bus driver can decide on this day that he will show up later, or not show up at all.  [laugh] Taxi drivers just want to chop carrot at every opportunity. I've ever kenna before reaching KL late night, and taxi driver took me to hor lan, then tell me he can't find the way, pay him more or drop me off at some ulu place near cemetery. This is the time when you need to appear more fierce and more street-smart than him. This is partly why Malaysian-founded Grab is a popular service in MY.
 
I've seen with my own eyes more than once, robbery or dispute with firearms in KL. This is the time when you don't want to be hero, quickly walk away where possible. Usually, it's business or gang dispute. I think just last month, got one M-16 firing near Maluri.
 
Having said that, I can't say it is unique to MY. I've also kenna rogue taxi driver in PRC and elsewhere before.

But in USA, it's not uncommon for men to tail female joggers in vehicles or just follow them to near their home.
In fact many female joggers have experienced this before, even in big cities like NYC.
 
It's quite scary for the women. These are just average jogger stories.

Horizon hill has quite a few sub development within the big project itself, each round about actually is  entrances to 2 individual estates on both side  if I am not wrong. Leading right up to the golf course I think got 3 round about, so yah main project by itself is f**king huge, but the estates within which were developed in phases are quite similar to any private gated residency estates, which are not small also. 
 
Running in Horizon hill is no joke, straight road in from main road to club house takes 10 min driving.

I always look around to make sure no one is following me out of the car and open/close my home door very quickly cuz someone might jump me.

Some women shared what they have experienced. A van following her as she runs. She call 911, they say not a crime  
 
1 writer who lives in NYC. She had this policy of never talking to anyone when she runs around the neighborhood. So for 3 years she never talked to anyone, even though she essentially get called a dao biatch in the past.
Then 1 time she made casual conversation to this guy whom she thinks is quite normal and she has seen around often. Then it started becoming creepy. So she didn't dare to go home for one hour and ran multiple loops around her neighborhood.
So now she doesn't run that route anymore.
 
I think for us, we just take it for granted. got PCN or route, we just run.

Crime will surely be climbing when you find more temporary residents like neighbourhoods with a lot of rentals, migrant workers, construction sites, .. for a simple fact that there will be more strangers wandering in the neighbourhood. For the same reason, JB and KL has a lot of migrant workers from other parts of MY and ID.  Same as Shenzhen, 90% migrant workers. Some parts of SG is slowly becoming that.

I have no experience  with taxi drivers in MY as I drive there most of the time, but i have my fair shares of stories with Taxi drivers in Mainland china, some quite scary, some really quite funny.  Bangkok also has security issues I encounter, so is Jakarta. MY is just part of the world.

Yup, I stay in EC but there is no security la. It's the same as a HDB and even many district 10 PCs are also like that, anyone can happily walk in without being challenged. 
 
Definitely good to be well lit but if there's no one around, got use meh? Maybe I am paranoid but I am most fearful when opening the door to enter my home. Because that's when some fellow can come up behind you with a knife just as you open the door, push you in and then lock it.
 
If it is out in the open, there is a lot more risk to the fellow and I can try to run also (but not if I have my kid with me).
 
The previous article where some fellow in a landed estate claims his neighbors all don't lock the door is just       to me.

If I park my car, I will take all bags or even plastic bags and put in the boot. If I have a laptop, I won't even leave it in the boot, will bring it along with me.

Horizon hill has quite a few sub development within the big project itself, each round about actually is  entrances to 2 individual estates on both side  if I am not wrong. Leading right up to the golf course I think got 3 round about, so yah main project by itself is f**king huge, but the estates within which were developed in phases are quite similar to any private gated residency estates, which are not small also. 
 
Running in Horizon hill is no joke, straight road in from main road to club house takes 10 min driving.  
i passed by 3 roundabout while sending my friends children home......ya, its freaking big. If no vehicle.....damn cialat! I prefer my other friends gated compound.....one rd which will reach a small park at the end but with a few branch rd. The end unit have a very big yard by the side....can put a basketball court inside...

Not crime, but I notice rather commonly, Taxi drivers can anyhow swap .. the photo on the license, not the same driver and they tell you "沒事沒事". Even you call for Didi (CN's Uber), the car can arrive in a different license plate number from the app and they also tell you "沒事沒事". Recently, there's been a few rape cases relating to Didi. The most recent case, the customer when she felt suspicious even called Didi for help, and no help was given before kenna raped.
 
I have no experience  with taxi drivers in MY as I drive there most of the time, but i have my fair shares of stories with Taxi drivers in Mainland china, some quite scary, some really quite funny.  Bangkok also has security issues I encounter, so is Jakarta. MY is just part of the world.

lol u stay in EC right.
 
Actually i feel very safe in SG. Cos generally everywhere is quite well lit. haha i'm usually more worried about areas like landed housing the streets (cos can be quiet and rather desolated with everyone in the homes) rather than HDB carparks/estates.

 
 
I stay opp to a private landed estate, very quite indeed. Sometimes I will run inside the estate at night just for the fun of looking at different houses ( I dont usually run there because i hate the ups and downs of the roads), and the thing that annoy me most is the dogs barking whenever I run pass those houses.  And the CB thing is one bark all bark!!!

the same reasons why people would want to stay close to a cemetery or crematorium or next to Singapore casket
 
there are flats so close to the MRT line, I remember taking one towards Woodlands once. 
 
to each his or her own
 
 
some no choice because it is cheaper and got big enough space for the extended family
 
 
in short, some got no choice but other got choice, people make decisions differently

Outside of HH, there are also a few smaller developments, something like what you mention. Nearer the water tank there got 2 or 3 I think. 
 
A guy i know bought 2 units, the corner and the unit next to it, he knn turn the corner unit into a small garden with a bloody putting green!!  
wah.....personal green.....atas! Nearer Aeon also have. As i told my friend buying in jb for singaporean is never a financial investment.....its for retirement! My friend say if can rent its better. Can shift house every few yrs.....no massive outlay and not chained. For me if i do that i will chose one very far away from sg.....PD or trengganu, live a simple life and do charity for the community.

Exactly, the whole point is to prevent foreigners from buying up housing and then rent to the locals. Since the locals can buy cheaper, they won't pay a higher rent from foreigners.
 
Of course, nobody stops you from renting at a cheap rate.

Public transport is rubbish. Bus driver can decide on this day that he will show up later, or not show up at all.  [laugh] Taxi drivers just want to chop carrot at every opportunity. I've ever kenna before reaching KL late night, and taxi driver took me to hor lan, then tell me he can't find the way, pay him more or drop me off at some ulu place near cemetery. This is the time when you need to appear more fierce and more street-smart than him. This is partly why Malaysian-founded Grab is a popular service in MY.
 
I've seen with my own eyes more than once, robbery or dispute with firearms in KL. This is the time when you don't want to be hero, quickly walk away where possible. Usually, it's business or gang dispute. I think just last month, got one M-16 firing near Maluri.
 
Having said that, I can't say it is unique to MY. I've also kenna rogue taxi driver in PRC and elsewhere before. 

So did you eventually pay the driver more?
 
I had a similar incident in New York when I was travelling on a business trip a number of years ago. It was already past midnight after landing at JFK International Airport and clearing the custom. I was alone and very tired after the long-haul flight and long queue at the custom, and just wanted to get to the hotel room as soon as possible for a shower and rest before a business meeting in a few hours' time. It was freezing cold at the taxi stand outside and there was already a long queue. When I was about to join the queue, a negro approached me and offered a limo service. I asked if the ride would be based on metered fare and if a receipt would be issued. With his affirmation, I followed him into his car. After a couple of minutes into the journey to the hotel, I realized that he did not turn on the meter, so I reminded him to do so, but he started to quote me a flat rate which was much higher than I would expect for the short journey to the hotel. Even though I could claim reimbursement for expenses related to the business trip, I firmly turned him down and asked him to either go with the agreed meter rate or drive me back to the airport. He continued to drive for a while before suddenly making an U-turn and drove me back to the airport, but not without cursing and swearing all along the way, while I kept silent so as not to provoke him further. Thinking back, I wonder if I had been rash, as he was much taller and had a burly figure, and might even have a gang. Nowadays, I will try to make prearrangement for limo service if possible or queue for a taxi when travelling overseas.

No, I didn't. I just pretended to call a friend and spoke something in local lingo. The taxi driver took me to my destination safely on meter and at a discount.

queue at taxi stand also not the safest of all. I was sold away to "return taxi"  for RMB50 at shenzhen airport, and I bloody paid RMB250 to the taxi at the airport.  
 
Another time the taxi driver wanted us to pay to him RMB10 more on the return trip because of peak hour traffic, i refuse and told him to go back on his own, i can wait until peak hr over.

Shenzhen is cowboy town lor.  
 
Bloody hell, airport staff led me to this shaddy "taxi driver" who led me to his private car, some lao pok chia that looks like it came out of one of the Hong Kong mainland robber movie, "这是打表的出租车, 有发票的". In my heart, "NNH, you think I'm stupid.". But never say that, just walked away.

a lot of people think of retirement as maybe between 60-80 thereabouts when they are still active, can drive car, move house every few years, do charity work some more.  
 
But what about beyond, when you are old and infirm, can't work, need people to shower and help you pee, then what?  really still want to live in a foreign land at that point?

Not to mention the litany of documents/ red tape your spouse or kids have to go thru'  when you are no more around and want to transfer the property and the legal implications involved as the legal filing may have to be done in both countries all over and probate or letters of admin in both countries altogether.....and locals will low ball when they know a foreigner is selling or they just cannot afford to pay with our prices which we have paid...... there is also capital gains tax if sold within 5 years too... Think Long Term,........ very very long term.... I dont even know if the LPA (Lasting Power of Attorney done here) is valid for foreign properties to be encashed ......we are not getting young and assume that our mental capacities are going to be that good too......

Under critical stage, can always ambulance back to Singapore.
 
Of course, it is not suitable for ppl who cannot live out of this cocoon.

totally agree on your inputs, and that is also why I mentioned there is a very high chance I wont retired somewhere else. To retired somewhere away from home is never easy, its easy to think abt it now, but there are really many considerations and when the time finally arrive to pull the trigger, not many are actually able to do it. 
 
But thats just me, for me it will be more of an emotional thingy to be born Singaporean and die Malaysian. Family will always be another factor that will hold me back, beside the thought of the body aging each day. 
 
However, using security, transportation and time of travel to  negative the idea is not something I find logical and acceptable. There are always choices, and we have to take charge and make that choice ourselves.

That's why it makes sense to rent if u are living in malaysia and still hold your HDB/condo in Sg lor. Wind direction change, come back here

For foreign property, u can always have it under whoever you want them to inherit.
 
Under critical stage, can always ambulance back to Singapore.
 
Of course, it is not suitable for ppl who cannot live out of this cocoon.

 
TBH, I am quite an environment adapting animal,  and i can likely stay anywhere and blend in a short period of time. But I think when I grow older, there is a high chance I might just crawl back into the cocoon and stay home.      
 
But again, thats just me, however i still think that the option is valid. Who knows, when I finally decide to stop work, I might just pack up and go backpack ard the world while I still can move and piak piak..

Yah lor, TCSS only, I also think highly unlikely I will retired anywhere else.  
 
Even if I want, the woman may not want, and the children may need me to fetch grandchildren and things like that. 
 
I think first is go rent for 3 months see really can stay there long term or not, not everyone can be a fast adapting animal. Seriously I think most SG Chinese will find it not easy, esp if spoken Malay is half past 6 kind.

As we grow older, our health and body might not allow us to do what we had plan in our 40s.
 
Goes back to heart vs mind. For me, I think I would still want to remain in sin. This has been home since birth and it won't be easy to just pack up and go retire somewhere else when old. Like some bros said, health care is one big concern liao.

if u can drive around, or be driven around regularly to the various doctors there, i don't think the healthcare there is bad.
But if u are like mostly in wheelchair, want to leave the house also difficult, confirm SG is much better.

i think can adapt lah. but it will take 1-2 years. I think just purely retirement in SG, my dad also took like 1-2 years to get into his comfort zone.

wen you visualise a retirement overseas, you are seeing thing from your current age, when you grow older your perception change.
 
plus the activities you do when you are there now will be different when you are starting there 24/7/365x??. Friends, neighbourhood, food, activities, etc that you can accept now might not be the same after that.

If a person is confined to a wheelchair, There are better places to be than SG. I hv already walked the ground and done the research. The biggest issue is the cost of helpers/ nursing aides. 
Based on an apple to apple comparison, in sg, the single maid will likely  roll u to the hawker centre bio beer aunty. 
Overseas, for the same cost, u can get 2 assistants roll u ard the retirement village in a golf cart.

However, your loved ones may not all agree with u and prefer to keep u alive regardless of costs. Have to start to manage their mindset at a early stage. 
Regardless whether we are comatose or awake, the manpower requirement to support an elderly is tremendous. SG is really at a disadvantage. The strain will be felt by the children. 
Unfortunately, in SG we cant hv a graceful instant death thru euthanasia. The wheelchair bound phase is an unavoidable reality. Leave it to the govt.. and likely its going to be a 6 bedder ending.

Food and accomodation less than SGD 2k a month. The 6 bedder concept in a high rise setting proposed by SG govt really sounds depressing to me. At least this place offers a landed village setting.
 Oh.. they do allow smoking n drinking!

yah, I have been talking abt it since a few years back with the family, in particular the children.  The old woman will always scold me whenever I talk abt it, the elder daughter usually will tear, the 2 younger ones will just keep quiet.
 
Some of the things I mentioned to them, over and over are,
 
If I am strike with cancer, any terminate illness, wheelchair and cannot take care of myself,  dont try to save me , I dont want to spend money and yet have to suffer. Keep the money for the younger ones,  look at economy value. My funeral will be a simple Buddhist format, just keep me for 3 days, and get it over asap, dont disturb me with those loud chinese music and  sai gong  prayers, let me go in peace. 
 
Actually, selfishly, I want to leave the world leaving behind a great father image, one that brought joy and happiness to the family, one that the children will miss and proud to talk about with their children and not a father that drain dry savings of children and make everyone miserable. 
 
Whatever I leave behind is for the living to use, not to use it on myself. Whats the point of wasting money to save an old man of no economy value and bring hardship to the children when I am gone, makes no logical sense at all.

Why must Mahathir keep saying that Sâpore was once their land.
 
Can Malays, Bumis compete if 3 million Chinese nationals come here?'
 
âIf we bring in another three million people from China, what will happen to us? They are strong, able, knowledgeable in business; they come not as labourers but as successful entrepreneurs.
âCan we compete with them?â
âI am certain that if we bring in three million more people from China, we will lose our place. The rich among them will buy our land. We will be moved further from the city until we have to live next to the jungle.
âThis is what I am seeing. Singapore was once ours, and now we cannot dominate Singapore because our people cannot compete with the Chinese,â he said.

Ok... Tun M is just too good. Why?
 
1. China not happy money outflow. Curb people sending money out. But still leak. So, Tun M help to stop that. China keep quiet for ECRL default.
2. Singapore feels insecure as FC is only 2km away from Singapore. Affecting the water. Dayung sampan pun boleh cross. Tun M chop the reclaim of Islands. Singapore immediately OK to delay HSR for 2 years for free. Coincidence?

the purpose of the chinese buying property in msia (or got it free for buying one in china) is to let the children stay in msia to complete their study, maybe in international school and apply for the university back in china.

yes very contradictory to the MM2H information. Unless there is an annual cap of the long term visas allowed for each nationality. 
Like USA has a cap on the foreign investor getting green card program.
For the last 10 years, the PRCs always reach their cap and have >> applicants than spaces.
But in recent years, the indians are the one coming close to reaching their cap, especially since Trump came on board and is anti-immigrant

Not counting offshore outsourcing, there were more than tens of thousands of onsite outsourcing employees there on L1 (intracompany transfer) visas, for the likes of Infosys, Wipro, IBM, .. and they are not just outsourcing for tech companies, but also backend operations in retail, manufacturing, etc. It has now been relatively tightened.
 
Won't comment on what's right or what's wrong or what's best, but the common sense is nobody would believe there are no locals keen to take on these backend operations jobs. And this is partly why Trump got his popularity votes.

Those E1B visas yeah already tightened down.
The investor ones haven't tighten down yet. That's why the rich indians are bringing their children in via that. Cos the the work visa has been tightened.
The indian nationals are crying foul. Though i think it's perfectly justified by US administration.

I was in JB on wednesday at Sutra, super market.saw this group of china people queuing to pay at the cashier. Flash many gold, platinum cards but reader don't work. A ventleman in their group took a stash of cash for them to pay.
 
Going by what i saw, it is just when the Malaysians will be  very unhappy with such scene.

My 15 minutes behind the queue tell a different story. The average malaysians dont care and dont appreciate their investment. All they know is, these people are so loud and flashing their wealth that we dont have. They cause delays by buying so much and bringing up prices.
 
They need to learn how to keep a low profile in foreign land.

Yesterday I when to take a look at this Forest City Golf Resort, I must say they are very excessive and aggressive. No wonder TDM is so concerned.   This only can happen with China associated development. 
 
In term of economy, execution and development, it is a fantasy job. Can the locals benefit from this? I really don't know. It is a 'too massive miss-fit' job.

In my personal opinion, no country like to see their place turn into little china town or little india no matter how much investments they bring in. Foreigners living in whichever country has to 'immerse' into the environment and not change it. We in Singapore are already complaining despite sharing the fruits. What happen for those that didn't get the chance to even taste the fruits?

 为马国买家量身打造 森林城要建可负担房屋
 

 
（早报讯）为了一洗森林城发展项目“只为中国人建造”的负面形象，马来西亚森林城将在三年内推出可负担房屋单位，致力提升马国人对这项大型发展项目的参与度。
森林城发展商碧桂园太平洋影有限公司（CGPV）战略总监黄詝瀚说，森林城将配合马国政府所提出的建议，在未来三年内兴建专为马国人民量身打造、更符合当地人品味及需求的可负担房屋单位。
他接受《透视大马》专访时透露：“房屋及地方政府部向我们建议兴建符合马国人民需求及可以负担得起的产品。他们希望我们可以推出一些定制化的产品，在价格、品味及设计上更符合国人的需求。”
   
他指出，虽然森林城是一项迎合国际市场的发展项目，但该公司也了解马国人对房产的特定喜好，例如马国人喜欢房间多，而不是公共空间大的房子；此外，马国人也偏好有地房产，而不是公寓单位。
他也说，建议中的可负担房屋单位可以建在森林城项目的开发区内，也可以兴建在其他适合的地区，一切将视政府的建议而定。

In order to wash the negative image of the Forest City development project “built only for the Chinese”, the Forest City of Malaysia will launch affordable housing units within three years, and strive to increase the participation of Malaysians in this large-scale development project.
 
Forest City developer Country Garden Pacific Shadow Co., Ltd. (CGPV) strategy director Huang Wei said that Forest City will cooperate with the Malaysian government's proposal to build a tailor-made for the Malaysian people in the next three years, more in line with local tastes and needs. Affordable housing units.
 
In an interview with "Introduction to Malaysia", he revealed: "The Ministry of Housing and Local Government has recommended to us to build products that meet the needs of the people of Malaysia and can afford them. They hope that we can introduce some customized products at prices, tastes and The design is more in line with the needs of the people."
 
He pointed out that although Forest City is a development project that caters to the international market, the company also understands the specific preferences of Malaysians for real estate. For example, Malaysians prefer more rooms than houses with large public spaces. In addition, Malaysians also prefer Landed property, not apartment units.
 
He also said that the proposed affordable housing units could be built in the development zone of the Forest City project or in other suitable areas, all depending on government recommendations.

So forest city will be transformed into a Chinlay town.

All China development have the same issue. Everything comes from China.

Does it benefit local?
Just across our waters china built a power plant on an indonesian island. From land clearing to full operations the whole complex is enclosed, all china staff and 0 interaction with locals. Even got their own seaport inside. Its their money so they get to do that plus they pay local tax. Locals just watch from outside the fence.
