When I compare today's private properties for the mass market with those older ones,  I can't help but to notice the disturbing trends:
 

1)  Disproportionate balconies and aircon ledges  ---  I understand there was that 10% bonus GFA thing but aren't all the building plans supposed to be approved by authority?  When you can barely fit a L-shaped sofa in your living room, what do you plan to do with that gigantic balcony?  Outdoor dining for all 3 meals in tropical Singapore?
 

2) Cheaper material  --- homo tiles in livng/dining halls and laminate floor in bedrooms? 
 

3) Mini bedrooms -- I've seen 4-bedroom units for <1300 sqf and I was already amazed, and I think newer ones now come with even smaller sizes??? Better still,  in that tiny space there are still 4 toilets (incl. the maid WC), one (sometimes two) balcony and at least one big A/C ledge!  So why the need to even lay the floor with laminate since it's all gonna be covered by your bed and mini-wardrobe anyway?
 

4) Convert every inch of open space into a pool --- there is hardly any walking space in many new condos today as it's all taken up by pools, square, round, oval, and you name the shape.  I guess all residents are expected to roam around in swimming attire between say, your block and club house and BBQ pits.  While I can understand the incentives for developers to be obssesed with bay windows and balconies,  what on earth is the incentive for so many pools?  Cheaper to build pools than pathways/gardens/play grounds? 
 

Any other unpleasant trends?

yea its called maximizing profits by squeezing everyone on the psf :)

everyone in Sg wants to be a home owner .. what better way than to sell 500sqft at an extremely high psf, just so one can say they are a home owner in Singapore ... ><
 

you forgot the most important thing .. void areas! you too, can be charged for an area that you can never hope to use!

I like condos with big pools. Its nice to look down and see a vast volume of water.

Its nice to sit by the big pool and read a book.

Property curbs add $1 billion to tax revenue
Published on May 03, 2013

By Esther Teo Property Correspondent
 

THE raft of cooling measures imposed to tame the red-hot property market has delivered more than $1 billion in additional levies to the taxman.
 

The surge in revenue was bolstered following the additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) of up to 15 per cent that was rolled out in January.
 

About $158 million in ABSD was netted in February and March, bringing the total until March to $1.03 billion since the tax was introduced in December 2011, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) told The Straits Times recently.
 

The January measures - the seventh since September 2009 - also marked the first time that Singaporean investors buying their second homes were penalised with an additional tax.

How about limited carpark lot. Gam gam ho one lot per household. Those having 2 cars or more siao liao.



 

Some developments, especially those so called "near to MRT" will not have gam gam ho lots. The number of parking lots is actually lesser than the number of households. If you intent to buy, must ask the agent. If not, they might just conveniently assume you know.

duh... why are you people complaining???
 

can't you see that it is better for this 1billion dollars to go into the government pocket rather than the developers????
 

You cannot stop the masses from joining the property craze and buying and paying high prices. It is the PEOPLE's choice to pay for such expensivep properties.
 

So it is either you let the developers earn or claw back some of it through taxes and save those money when the crash comes... cuz Singapore is going to need EVERY CENT. Look at Spain and Ireland. You think malaysia/indonesia will bail us out?

I always got this impression that new condo buyer usually view less than 20 other developments before placing that order down. Wonder if I'm right?
 

If one view 20+-30+ development and units before committing, usually will manage to find good deals.

Actually you get more than what you pay for.

My maintenance and sinking is almost $500 for a 1000sft unit .but with less than 200units in the development, its worth it with more serenity, peace, exclusivity and the right neighbors...tennis court and swimming pool and facilities always available and uncrowded, property upkeep and management is professional and tip top
 

Heh heh isnt that what it's all about to begin with?
 

Moreover, i hv plenty of parking lots ,even 3 cars 2 bikes also no problem at all.
 

No point staying in a "public" private housing.  Better keep the money and go for a newer hdb.

I think we are talking about mass market condos.  Yours is a different class altogether. Of course there are plenty of high-end ones with spacious layout.
 

Maybe we should mark my words,  and check back to this thread 10 years later.  Those "new"development built in the last decade with tiny bedrooms, huge baywindows and balconies may be even cheaper than the older ones. Of course that's assuming the people and the market becomes rational again.

I was looking at it too, but decided to buy landed instead.  

The feel, design and location is pretty good.   However for me with two young kids i think landed wasnt wrong.  
 

Now looking to sell my condo in D9.  

If manage to sell maybe i should look at botanika again.

Or perhaps a semi detach.
 

The stamp duty is quite a put off.

I think we are talking about mass market condos.  Yours is a different class altogether. Of course there are plenty of high-end ones with spacious layout.
 

Maybe we should mark my words,  and check back to this thread 10 years later.  Those "new"development built in the last decade with tiny bedrooms, huge baywindows and balconies may be even cheaper than the older ones. Of course that's assuming the people and the market becomes rational again.




With developers like oxley and fragrance (more like fart, to me), tiny units are here to stay. Even reputable developers have succumbed. CDL selling 3 br+ "study" sized at 1100+ sq ft.  
 

Look at Hong Kong. Crazy hobbit sized abode that forces you to roam the streets.  
 

And we are heading in that direction.

Except that in HK, the weather is cool 3/4 of the year even though their summers are unbearable.
 

We in Singapore are in permanent heatwave all times of the year.
 

If Singaporeans are forced to stay out on the streets except to go home to sleep, we had better have public bathing and shower bath houses and facilities all over the island, and in the office. Unisex one I also don't mind, like in Japan.

I do not know about Hong Kong, but in many places, staying out in the colder months is not only not fun, it can be tormenting, or even fatal. 
 

At least in Singapore, while having warm night, is actually more bearable. They do not find you dead in the morning, if you drunk & fell asleep at a corner.

My in laws are staying in D10 condo TOP in 2009. 3 br around 1500 sqft.

Good size and they bought at the right time before prices doubled today.

 Maint and sinking were initially 300 plus but now shot up to 600 plus. 

No tennis court or kids playground. Only pool and gym but still damn ex.

Don't like going there Sun and PH cos the guards don't allow parking inside during these times

Imho condo living ain't worth the money one had to pay. Once inside, it's no difference to HDB which is done up nicely.

It is just a private apartment.

That's why i told my mom not to worry.. her tenant vacated the room cos the $600 rental is too high for her.. 
 

I told my mom to ask for $800 cos property prices are all going up. No need to back down and rent cheap. She's been looking for 6 months now, i believe she will get a tenant by end of this year.

That's partially true.  What bothers me and I'm sure a lot of others is:  while the overall size is being reduced,  the size of balconies and A/c ledges is increasing??!!  So your net livable space takes a double wammy...

Thats my personal valuation, does not apply to whether can get or not.

In other words, this development is only valued at such in my eyes.

It's just a personal opinion epressed in dollars terms but not an investment opinion at all whatsoever
 

Whether it is possible to get at $750psf just depends on how many owners are swimming without trunks when the low tide hits them.

it's really a patience game. i have been looking for a place for over a year now ... finally bit the bullet and bought a place in river valley @ 1300psf cos seller bought another place and needed the money (lucky i listened to my gf cos she hated the last place we found ... this new one is extremely well maintained and bldg is only a few years old) ... so i just gave the agent a cheque and wrote the deadline on the back (same day, by 6pm) and half hour before my deadline was over, i got the otp in hand ...

Opinions differing is fact of life, nothing to be sorry about dude.
 
 

I like the location , peaceful , quiet, 

Design is stylish and timeless

Must go view again and try to capture feeling.

If got feeling then can proceed to next step.

If not no point.
 
 

Note: i always buy with mentality that i may use it in future. So its not just a pure investment decision to me.

I m living in an old condo, over 15yo estate.
 

Building looks dated, 400 units. 

Full marble floors tiles for living rm, not some homogenous s--t

Teak wood for rooms. This is very exp, not the lousy plywood veneers most condos use nowadays. This is seperate teak planks.

Why I say this is exp. recently a empty unit was opened by condo management, and its floors and cupboards were stripped by burglars. dunno when it was stolen, apparently thieves sneaked in to a brand new empty unit and took off with all the wood. Air con units was left behind though.
 

Cupboards are wood with inlaid, dun see these nowadays, was told my my ID, its expensive to make.

Size of unit 1400 sq with 3 toilets, decent size rms.

Small swimming pools, looks like 20m in length, a joke, more like a puddle. lots of room around estate, gardens and a decent playground.
 

Yet whenever I go to new showrooms these days, I love the newness. big swimming pool, nice facilities which I do not have in my estate.

My estate also looks so dated, you could mistake it for a flated factory :(
 

I guess the old condos in the area of orchard / holland V will be ideal. Big open spaces, interesting architecture.. Tulip gardens, 

Condos in Arcadia drive is very nice too, a lot of greenery, nice gardens. Huge units

Teak wood for rooms. This is very exp, not the lousy plywood veneers most condos use nowadays. This is seperate teak planks.

Why I say this is exp. recently a empty unit was opened by condo management, and its floors and cupboards were stripped by burglars. dunno when it was stolen, apparently thieves sneaked in to a brand new empty unit and took off with all the wood. Air con units was left behind though.
 

Cupboards are wood with inlaid, dun see these nowadays, was told my my ID, its expensive to make.

Size of unit 1400 sq with 3 toilets, decent size rms.

Small swimming pools, looks like 20m in length, a joke, more like a puddle. lots of room around estate, gardens and a decent playground.
 

Yet whenever I go to new showrooms these days, I love the newness. big swimming pool, nice facilities which I do not have in my estate.

My estate also looks so dated, you could mistake it for a flated factory :(
 

I guess the old condos in the area of orchard / holland V will be ideal. Big open spaces, interesting architecture.. Tulip gardens, 

Condos in Arcadia drive is very nice too, a lot of greenery, nice gardens. Huge units



 
 

Nail on the head, dude.
 

Thats why timeless design, feel, layout and look will triumph.

The good ones are like that.  

There is a charm no matter what and it is well maintained and managed.

And people staying there have lived there since day one, all oldneighbors, got relationship, got courtesy.
 

Not like some upstart condo, filled with half past sixes, all trying to keep up with Joneses.

Chey!  
 

Viceroy fully understands me in this aspect.

Yes, such a difference in picture quality.
 

Agents here simply take pictures with their iphones without bothering (or "bordering" as some idots think it's spelt here) to clean up the place a little.
 

Just move the laundry aside or throw some cushions onto a bed or sofa - weird people here.

California? 
 

In the end of the day, an apartment is still an apartment. Unless you have to live in the city, it seems silly money to spend. If I live in California, I would rather live a little away & get a proper house for a faction of the price (so I can BBQ any time, & can watch my kids play on the comfort of my crotch   ). 
 

But you cannot argue with more space. But I think in Singapore, people care more about location, & facilities, maybe.

Thats my personal valuation, does not apply to whether can get or not.

In other words, this development is only valued at such in my eyes.

It's just a personal opinion epressed in dollars terms but not an investment opinion at all whatsoever
 

Whether it is possible to get at $750psf just depends on how many owners are swimming without trunks when the low tide hits them.




Tough wait n monitoring then.

Hdb is maybe better but not better. Give u a good example: 30 years ago, u pay $50k for a 5 room HDB, your friend paid $120k for a big condo. Now yr hdb becomes $1mil which is a smart move. Yr friend condo worth 2mil, which is also a smart move. Both properties fully paid up, then opportunity strike and both needs 900k to invest. U have to sell the flat else no cash, your freind remortgage 50% and got the cash out.
 

Another example: a client bought a landed in 19080s for less than 500k, today valuations is more than 10mil, client is retired and took a term loan of 5 mil out to buy bonds, with cost of borrowing at 1%+, while receiving 5%+ bond yield... Every month receive $15k just doing nothing for past few years.. so if interest rate move up, client sells away the bond and repaid the loan... But 5 years already earn $600k+ net of loan interest... 
 

If client spent $60k buy the 5 room hdb in 1980, can she enjoy this?
 

My friend, life is full of unknown.. now u may be laughing at your friend for paying more to buy a condo that cost more than your 4 room hdb and yet smaller... But 20 years later, when he can still takes cash out of his condo without selling and u can't, then u will sew the difference of both type of ownership.

Windy Heights' current bank valuation already $1K psf.  The newly launched mass market condo around Bedok and Tanamera are going for about $1.5K psf (with 99 years).

Not sure what the attraction is about these heartland 99 year condos.
 

For that price, I could get a trendy-looking, freehold condo (fewer than 100 units with swimming pool and gym) in Balestier area, fully-fitted with designer fittings (originally fitted by the developer).
 

Freehold, closer to town, potential to be yuppie area.

The price of property next to major roads or expressways are difficult to sell off bec its noisy, dusty and sometimes it vibrates, usually only cater to people with certain budget yet want certain areas. Its usually 20-30% cheaper than neighbouring development that do not face the expressway. Some more these kind of next to expressway units are much more difficult to dispose off when its buyer's market. 
 

I bought one such unit that near expressway before.. took me 9 months to sell off.. these kind even if its $750psf I also will not buy.

Don't talk about the condos..talk to yourself...Why you need a condo at the first place....r u rich? filthy rich? or juz so so?....



 

Well bro... If you want to live in the central area, there are not many HDBs available...  and any HDB in central area is likely to be very expensive anyway.
 

And freehold private property has residual value far higher than 99 years private and HDB by virtue of the land it is standing on... because of the potential for en bloc forever - the land which the condo stands on is in perpetuity so theoretically can en bloc infinite number of times for an infinite future.
 

Even disregarding plot ratio potential, en bloc chance is high considering the projected increase in population in the next 15 to 30 years, 50 years, 100 years, 200 years... yes we may not be around anymore but these are assets with high value to be passed down thru the generations, in one form or another (ie: it could be converted into cash, or used to exchange for another condo unit, etc).

I think it boils down to what do you want to acheive in life. Both have its ups and downs.

Investing in property may yield financial gains say 30 years later and give u better retirement finances but it comes at a price for many. That price is the lock-in of your life for the next 30 years servicing that instalment. Forget about early retirement, changing job for less stress/interest, more time for family, constant concern abt job security, allowing wife to stop working to fulfill fully the role of motherhood etc. 

On the other hand, buying a HDB (assuming much cheaper instalment) mean being debt free much earlier which frees up one's life option to do the above and be less hang-up over how life sucks if u have to stay in job for next 30 years, like it or not. Of cos, the flip side is the loss of potential financial upside vs a pte property and all the good things associated with higher disposal income later in life to do things you like.

That is why i always believe life is fair, u win some , u lose others. Just which one you choose and dun complain later on. There is no such thing as "zao zi dao" aka "if i know earlier" when people always like to think back...

By the way, if you are in your 50's or 60's and you wish to do a re-mortgage of your fully paid up bungalow, eg: bungalow worth $15m and you wish to take out a mortgage of $5m, the bank will require you to pay back within a very short tenure.  And they will still require income statements. This is what I was told by a mortgage banker.

A good illustration of my point about not having to lay laminate/timber/whatever floor in your bedroom as your bed already covers the whole area.  And you can open/close your curtain without having to get off your bed.
 

Won't need TV remote either as you can reach your TV panel from sitting in the sofa!

good point there

Windy Heights' current bank valuation already $1K psf.  The newly launched mass market condo around Bedok and Tanamera are going for about $1.5K psf (with 99 years).



 

what is attractive is the condo is not packed and the surface carpark but abit far to walk to mrt... about 15-20mins

I drive past Siglap V frequently and it is a serious eye sore. On a good day, it looks like a condo in Geylang. On a bad day, it looks like a Malaysian industrial park. 
 

Location wise, the junction is far too busy for any peace and quiet. There are plenty of nice condos in Siglap with lots of character (eg Hacienda) to consider - Siglap V is not one of them.

above 2000 psf for 99 year LH condo liao
 

Far East opens The Siena for preview
 
 



Prices are said to start from $1.28m for a 538 sq ft unit
 


 

[sINGAPORE] Far East Organization, which sold seven units of its ultra-luxury development Ferra, is also privately previewing The Siena.
 

Comprising 54 compact SOHO apartments, unit sizes of The Siena's one to three-bedroom apartments range from 538 to 980 square feet (sq ft).
 

The majority of the units are two-bedroom apartments to cater to families.
 

BT understands that prices start from $1.28 million for a 538 sq ft unit, which translates to about $2,380 per square foot (psf).

I think it boils down to what do you want to acheive in life. Both have its ups and downs.

Investing in property may yield financial gains say 30 years later and give u better retirement finances but it comes at a price for many. That price is the lock-in of your life for the next 30 years servicing that instalment. Forget about early retirement, changing job for less stress/interest, more time for family, constant concern abt job security, allowing wife to stop working to fulfill fully the role of motherhood etc. 

On the other hand, buying a HDB (assuming much cheaper instalment) mean being debt free much earlier which frees up one's life option to do the above and be less hang-up over how life sucks if u have to stay in job for next 30 years, like it or not. Of cos, the flip side is the loss of potential financial upside vs a pte property and all the good things associated with higher disposal income later in life to do things you like.

That is why i always believe life is fair, u win some , u lose others. Just which one you choose and dun complain later on. There is no such thing as "zao zi dao" aka "if i know earlier" when people always like to think back...




Ermm.. buying a private property doesn't mean needing to work no day no night and sacrifice family time... There are people who earns in excess of 300k per annum who stays in a hdb with no other properties and have millions of dollars in savings account, there are also people who earn in excess of 300k p.a who lives in a private property, and ahs a few other private properties and have not few millions bit maybe a million or so in savings account. There's no right or wrong, its matter of preference. 
 

However for youngsters who are not 30s who thinks that having private property is sacrificing life, then most likely he will be learning much lesser in future.
 

Some people who owns private properties are not paying thru their noses... They simply let others pay for them for the next 30years....

That's mass market mortgage banking. Talk to your private bankers, for accredited investors, guidelines are different... Some mass mortage bankers knowledge not good, talk to the right ones.

A good illustration of my point about not having to lay laminate/timber/whatever floor in your bedroom as your bed already covers the whole area.  And you can open/close your curtain without having to get off your bed.
 

Won't need TV remote either as you can reach your TV panel from sitting in the sofa!



 
 

Haha true. So it may not be a bad thing to live in a shoebox apartment. It is suitable for couch potato. Everything is within reach!

I don't think it is a showroom even though it look like one. The project is fully sold some time ago already. Looks like it is being done by the agent if u read the description carefully

Wa seh your property is 1500sqft right? I dont even drive a conti like all the big guns here in MCF...so I have no $4.5m to buy... 
 

I also no extra $$ to waste to give IRAS 10% ABSS...
 

Anyway if I have a budget of 3-4 mil for a condo, will likely go for a bigger apartment like park infinia which is out of town area, or a nice sea facing big one at Carribean... Personally choice no offense.
