Bros,
 
Need some advice from you guys, I am staying in the West and previously I was looking at Sea Horizon EC but at that time I haven't fullfilled my MOP and also the EC is in the east far from my work place too. 
 
Today there is a new EC launching soon in Jurong and I registered online. The person super helpful, call me and ask me for more information. I realised with my OT I exceeded the income ceiling. I was told that I need to appeal and subject to developer approval. I was disappointed because I have been waiting for this EC since I missed the previous one.
 
Yesterday our PM Lee talked about Jurong Lakeside transformation, hope to make some money in future for this EC. This EC is call Lakelife EC - www.thelakelife.com.sg. 
 
Any bros here bought an EC but exceed income ceiling and appeal successfully? Is developer or HDB very strict on income ceiling    
I waited for upgrade since last year but now income exceeded. super sian.
 
 
Thanks in advance.

Depends you exceeded by how much. If this EC is very popular ( I guess so) then developer why want to wait for u to get the HDB approval? Might as well sell to confirmed qualified buyers.
 
You should try those EC which already launched at least 6 mths but not fully sold yet. Developer more willing to "try" cos ultimately it's subject to HDB final approval.

Hope i dont offend, let me share some thoughts.
 
Currently have HDB almost fully paid 
Also did cross mind in buying EC but decided against it.
 
HDB is bigger in better location and neighbors are nice folks.
 
Buying EC means i give that all up and have to fork out more money and be in debt again.  In other words, be imprisoned yet again.  
 
Some people say, buying EC can hedge inflation etc.... I agree. But to ever be able to use the money you must sell the property. So LPPL.
 
My take is that i save up and invest all the possible cash i earn to give me passive income. I can still have a stable life, lesser stress, little or no debt and retire around 60....
 
Property buying is not wrong. But its truly rich man's game. And i think due to the sudden price increase in recent years ( which is no more)  normal folks think that they can "one step to heaven"
 
Ok, again hope i dont offend, my view only.

i was in the same boat.
looked at EC in the north, income exceeded ceiling, agent was super helpful (obviously, no sale no money) and said there shouldn't be a problem appealing and getting approval. What he said was the appeal will be decided by developer. HDB only issues guidelines.
????
yeah my reaction too.
 
queued up, picked unit..... then backed out (largely because I concur with Partagas above)
also, I foresee overcrowded facilities, low quality China developer, smaller size than my hdb (despite same number of rooms), overpriced (a resale pte condo nearby was selling less psf) etc
 
i'm sure you're looking at the upcoming EC near taman jurong.
Bear in mind the chinese developer snagged that plot on a record breaking bid at the peak of the boom 2 years back.

EC is a "trap" to slave you for another 25 years if you already fully paid your HDB
paying more for less is a downgrade from HDB to EC ... 
especially the "useable" space of the unit is < 1000 sqft with a gigantic balcony + aircon ledge + void space
not to mention the cheapo material and quality built by "china developer" but price at a premium .... EC leh don't play play

Agree. Got a friend this year turn 45 years and go commit on a condo for a loan of 32 years. Every month need top up over 1.8k for the loan. The only good side on this is that he can tell all his friends/relatives that he own condo....

For first timer buying EC which is cheaper by 20 to 30 % of nearby private condo is not a bad choice. 
 
Unless like your case you almost paid up your current hdb and may want to buy another unit to rent out for passive income then is different story.
 
With the new MSR in place,  the developer also won't dare to price the units too high. Worth explore.

Just curious how could your friend take up loan of 32 years at 45 years old? Thought maximum up to official retirement age of 62 at the moment? Or he has other co-owners at 30 years old? A very young wife perhaps?

Only in Singapore, people like to differentiate between so called HDB and EC. What makes a good living environment are your living space, your neighbors, your surrounding, amenities near by and commute. If you don't like where you stay, then look for a good location that meets what you feel is a good living environment, not just because it is an EC or Condo. Neighbors cannot choose, so it is the hardest factor but if they are good, then you are very lucky.

DId I interpret this statement wrongly ?
 
http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10321p.nsf/w/BuyingNewFlatEC?OpenDocument#ECSecondTimer
 
 
Second-timer Applicants
You or the essential family members listed in your application have owned/sold or are currently owners of:
Any HDB flat that was bought from HDB, or
Any resale flat that was bought under the CPF Housing Grant Scheme, or
A DBSS flat or an EC bought from the developer, or
Have enjoyed other forms of housing subsidy (for example, enjoyed benefits under the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme, privatisation of HUDC estate etc.)
 
Payment of Resale Levy
Second-timers who apply for new EC projects from Westwood Avenue onwards will have to pay a resale levy.
 
However, second-timers are not required to pay the resale levy if they apply to buy EC units in projects that were launched before 9 Dec 2013. More information on the tender launch dates for EC land sales can be found in the Residential Development List > Executive Condominium (EC).
 

 
Bro, 
 
I was told thelakelife ec is the last ec no need to pay resale levy because the developer bought the land before the new policy on resale levy. 
 
I have more allowance due to OT that's why exceeded, it's stated that allowance is included   . http://www.thelakelife.com.sg/e-application-online/documents-required-for-booking
 
The reasons why I am looking to upgrade since last year is because my friends who bought EC last time made ~$500K after 5 years, they sold their EC and bought a resale HDB back, they are debt free now. I am told that the EC price is still cheaper than private and after 5 years becoming private, it will appreciate. I just want to make some money and move back to hdb to retire 
 
The person just emailed the financial calculation, after moving into ec and sold my flat, my monthly payment also not high and affordable. now my only concern is the exceeding of income but this person sound like very experience said can help me. cross fingers.
 
Thanks all the bros for your advice.

you need to sell your HDB  when your EC obtains its TOP.
 
Basically, you are locking your buying price  (EC) now and selling price (your HDB) 3-4 year later. If the HDB resale price drops further in the next 3 year, the price difference between your EC and HDB will be even larger.

Agree. Got a friend this year turn 45 years and go commit on a condo for a loan of 32 years. Every month need top up over 1.8k for the loan. The only good side on this is that he can tell all his friends/relatives that he own condo....
 
Another good thing is if cannot pay loan, jump from condo more satki than jump from HDB.
 
Only in Singapore, people like to differentiate between so called HDB and EC. What makes a good living environment are your living space, your neighbors, your surrounding, amenities near by and commute. If you don't like where you stay, then look for a good location that meets what you feel is a good living environment, not just because it is an EC or Condo. Neighbors cannot choose, so it is the hardest factor but if they are good, then you are very lucky.
 
Face mah.. US got Facebook, Singapore don't have, so must have at least half.. And Face more important than book, so majority of Singaporeans look for FACE instead..
 
I feel that location is more important than HDB or EC or Condo.. Have nice condo in the ulu place, everyday travel to work til dulan, or have central location, everyday one bus / train to work, which better? Depends on preference liao..

Yes. Single income. I asked him if property crash or lost of high paying job how. he will jump.
 
Must at least hold for 5 years, else the SSD will kill him as well.

Single income very tough if you are not super cash rich or super high income earner. Sometimes even single income buy just a normal 3 room resale flat might have problem.

that's why agent can sell EC easily. simply throw you this story.
it's true because i also know someone did that.
but ... not 100% risk free hor ... do you own maths
 
the keyword here is last time ... last time EC is sibei cheap ... now all close to $1M !
bishan HDB better ... last time buy $350k-$400k now sell $1M ... 
 
The reasons why I am looking to upgrade since last year is because my friends who bought EC last time made ~$500K after 5 years, they sold their EC and bought a resale HDB back, they are debt free now. I am told that the EC price is still cheaper than private and after 5 years becoming private, it will appreciate. I just want to make some money and move back to hdb to retire

Tampines EC penthouse to sell at $2m
 
The $2m price tag of a 'presidential suite' penthouse apartment in Tampines has caused much debate as netizens question whether the price is justified. -AsiaOne
 
THE monster 4,349 sq ft "presidential suite" at an executive condominium (EC) project in Tampines will be the first EC unit to eclipse the $2 million mark if sold at its launch this weekend.
 
The Straits Times understands that the penthouse unit at 514-unit CityLife @ Tampines, which comes with a roof terrace of about 1,600 sq ft, will be priced at about $2.05 million - or $470 per sq ft (psf).
 
The unit price rises to $744 psf if only liveable space is counted.
 
If sold, the overall price will set a new record for an EC - the latest in a string of sky-high prices that have raised eyebrows and led to a raging debate on whether buyers of such expensive ECs should be entitled to Housing Board grants.

There will be no resale levy for Lakelife as land was brought before implementation of the new rule.
 
From Jan 2013, developers are only allowed to launch EC projects 15 months after the award of the site or after the physical completion of foundation works, whichever is earlier. This is the reason you have yet to see any new EC launches for this year.About 5 EC projects are expected to be launched this year. From next year onwards those new EC launches will be expected to include resale levy if the land sale was launched after 9 Dec 2013.

Not against buying ec or support buying...
 
Just that there are many many many condo in much much better location than the new construction EC.. 
 
downside is no new and shiok feeling, But u can stay in straightaway, or rent out straight away. 
 
Price wise I feel it's cheaper as factor in 3 years of instant occupancy.
 
It's a big piece of commitment.. Doesn't harm to spend some time do homework. Maybe see like 20-50 properties before deciding to go down to that new condo show flat and sign. Should be more well informed.

I believe many buyers are just waiting at the sidelines for the fire sale.
 
Not sure if developers can buy back their own units by setting up a different entity.
 
I do know of a major developer in buying up significant number of units and holding it empty till they feel the price is right and start to sell. One example is the Cascadia along bukit timah road.

I believe the purpose for EC is more geared for people to stay. Not really as an investment tool. For anyone who buys an EC purely for investment purposes, I would say, he is better off investing in property stocks.

IMO not a good time to buy any property now...there'll be further correction in price.
If buy private condo ya not a good time to buy cos prices is coming down. Developer dun dare to bid too high for new land. New launch in the future should be cheaper. 
 
Many choices in the market now, new launch and resales, if priced too high all kanna stuck.
 
It's buyer market now. Do some homework first when the right time arrives ( example no ABSD) then can go in liao.

Now Gov is like full force pushing EC, unless some years ago no New EC launch at all.
 
I still think for first timer if can afford then buy a small EC unit first. When down the road ( anyway the EC construction and MOP will add up to about 8 years) can afford then invest another unit to rent out for passive income.

I have been a low-level civil slave for the last decade so obviously the remuneration is like crap. paiseh if I cannot comprehend the logic of 'upgrading' to EC when I have worked pretty hard to fully pay off my hdb loan. In fact, the only thing I worry about at the moment is my boy's education. So even if I tio pok by ah gong tomorrow for any reason, think I won't be too worried, at least I know I won't be evicted from my humble flat.
 
Compared to some relatives, they literally live in fear of being retrenched from their jobs. I know of one who sold off his new car, resort to driving taxi at night and even borrowed $ from legalised ah long company cos he could no longer afford the monthly installments for his uncompleted condo. He claimed that he cannot sell now cos he would literally lose everything. Last I heard he's going to attend court to face some bankruptcy matters. He has three very young boys and the whole family had to move in with his in-laws...seriously XIA SUAY! BUT some ten years ago, he was doing very well. Fully paid up his 4rm HDB flat, bought a bmw 5 series with some profits from investments. At CNY can even brag that whatever he did, money would just keep following him.
 
The point of my post: Stay EC or private property really so shiok meh? I thought having a roof for our loved ones & spending quality time with them are the most important issues on hand? There must be some kind of priviledge or intrinsic value that I simply cannot fathom. Or have I been a lowly-paid civil slave for too long?

In fact, the only thing I worry about at the moment is my boy's education. So even if I tio pok by ah gong tomorrow for any reason, think I won't be too worried, at least I know I won't be evicted from my humble flat.
 
Compared to some relatives, they literally live in fear of being retrenched from their jobs. I know of one who sold off his new car, resort to driving taxi at night and even borrowed $ from legalised ah long company cos he could no longer afford the monthly installments for his uncompleted condo. He claimed that he cannot sell now cos he would literally lose everything. Last I heard he's going to attend court to face some bankruptcy matters. He has three very young boys and the whole family had to move in with his in-laws...seriously XIA SUAY! BUT some ten years ago, he was doing very well. Fully paid up his 4rm HDB flat, bought a bmw 5 series with some profits from investments. At CNY can even brag that whatever he did, money would just keep following him.
 
The point of my post: Stay EC or private property really so shiok meh? I thought having a roof for our loved ones & spending quality time with them are the most important issues on hand? There must be some kind of priviledge or intrinsic value that I simply cannot fathom. Or have I been a lowly-paid civil slave for too long?

 
To me, you are too kiasi, and your relative is too kiasu. Why not strike a balance between the 2?

It sounds like your relative either overstretched himself, lost quite some money in investments, or both.
 
Bro, need to balance between what you aspire for in life and also savings/investment.

yup ... need to balance
 
1. fully paid hdb > let out for $2500/mth (PM says one)
2. save enough $$ to buy PC ... no need next to MRT ... near LRT or 1-2 bus stop to MRT exchange. if got car, no issue liao.
3. time to buy at low price. not necessary to time the lowest like a guru but at least not the 2011-2013 crazy chop robert price
 
by doing so
 
1. your hdb is your safety net
2. got passive income to fund your PC
3. worst case scenario ... sell PC and move back to HDB (fully paid)
4. last but not least ... get a tok kong insurance coverage policy to cover yourself and your family (just in case)
 

It sounds like your relative either overstretched himself, lost quite some money in investments, or both.
 
Bro, need to balance between what you aspire for in life and also savings/investment.

Hi five, am with you there!
 
We are not oblivious, there is a difference clearly between HDB and condo.
But there are pros and cons.  Take note that i am comparing good HDB with mass mkt condos.
 
If we are comparing top end condos with HDB, then dont bother to debate, no basis becos the money involved is so different.
 
Bottomline is knowing the true reason for the "upgrade"
 
 Once the decision is made, then go for it as planned.
Do leave some room for mistakes.
Dont kill yourself and your family over it.

Some quick and simple maths.
 
Assume you take up a loan of S$500,000 for 20 years to buy that EC.
 
Interests payment at the end of 10 years will be around S$100,000. I assume 3.5% interest ...... this is not exactly the most prudent.
 
Monthly payment to service loan about S$3000.
 
 
So after 10 years and you managed to sell at S$1.5M, you will earn about $400,000 after deducting interest. Maybe S$350,000 if factor in renovation etc. 
 
Potential gain S$350,000. Monthly payment S$3000.
 
The gain attractive or not? Can tahan another S$3000 loan a month for next 10 years or not?
 
BIGGER QUESTION. When you sell for S$1.5M you cannot but HDB for 30 months. You gotto pay rent for somewhere to stay even if you intend to move back into resale HDB. Rental at S$2500 for 30 months means expense of S$75,000. So your net gain not even S$300,000.
 
If you intend to upgrade again, the price of another private property that is not EC type sure higher. Can afford?
 
Buy back HDB 5 room 13 years later........... also uncertain. That HDB you sold at S$500,000 may now be higher too.
 
 
BUT if staying in private very important to you .............. then what the heck. Just buy la. Nobody here can tell you for what will happen in 10 years time.

From my understanding, you can buy HDB from open markets (anytime) after you sell your EC. Or you can buy HDB resale first, you will then be given up to 6 months to sell off your private property.

this is right. you can buy resale  first then sell private within 6 months.  it is the bto that is 30 month wait from the day you sell your private.

rules will keep on changing; nothing is constant especially issues concerning cpf and housing in Singapore. 
 
So, don't use current rules as ultimate goalpost to plan your future.
 
Things may change drastically in the near future.
 
Be prepared also in situation whereby EC and pte property owners cannot downgrade to HDB even for resale units. It may be far-fetched in thinking now, but we never know.

i understand what u are saying
 
but posting something like this in MCF will make some ppl laugh, for they can easily pay off a mass market condo without any installment required.

Am I being kiasi or simply being realistic/financially prudent? I'd like to think of it as the latter. Some may even say that this is the classical case of 'sour grapes' owing to my adamant refusal to move on/change. Everyone is entitled to their opinon. End of the day: It's my money.
 
I adhere to this rule in life: The environment will NEVER adapt to suit you. You MUST either adapt or be phased out, that is the truth. No two-ways about it. When I was in Cambodia some years back,  I saw a 4yr old boy with his family looking for stuff (I have no idea what!) in a mountain of trash (yes, really a mountain!) I stood from a distance and watched...there was NOT a tinge of anger or resentment amongst the family members and there were also several families scavenging for stuff (really quite a sight to behold). The smell was simply horrendous and I'm cocksure they felt the same way under the scorching sun...but life has to go on. Is Pol Pot going to crawl out of HELL and say to this family: I am sorry for causing the genocide and the hardship u & yr families r gg through?  In retrospect, anyone in sillypore kena forced to upgrade to private housing like EC/condo owing to external pressure (Wife's constant nagging not counted hor)? Pls share cos I would really like to hear about how one can be 'coerced' into upgrading.
 
I look at some of my old buddies who are still in the legal & banking industries, do I envy them during gatherings? Yes of course! for the condo penthhouse they stay in, exotic cars they drive, the XMMs (local somemore!) they date and the wondrous AP ROO watches they don. Are they truly happy? NO. Many of them hate themselves and their lifestyles, endless travelling, 24-7 on standby, hp must be on and the list goes on. Can they opt out of the ratrace? Unfortunately cannot cos everything all on installment. Even the XMMs also on installment...go figure. Housing and car loans alone already enuff to maim and even possibly kill.
 
So am I kiasi or just acting out of financial prudence? I would admit a bit of both. My first job was in a law firm and I celebrated my 25th & 26th b'day as well as X'mas eve in the High Court with my senior partners and the Judge. Luckily the DC was also in the Courtroom to keep me company. Then I moved on to bank and kena arrow London market so whilst I worked, my family was asleep. That went on for three years, gained 15kg cos it's work,eat,sleep & repeat. The money was definitely wonderful but my life was in pieces. Got the life to earn BUT must also have the life to spend. Back then, if I had committed to a condo, think I would still be in the bank now.
 
So do I feel contented now? God has been extremely kind to me so I definitely cannot complain that life is no good. I sleep with a peaceful mind on a queen size bed not having to worry abt the loans I have to service. Is being contented synonymous with kiasi? To some, maybe but to each his own. At the end of the day, staying in my teeny-weeny hdb flat and be happy with family is of paramount importance to me. To trade my flat for EC/condo, start another HUGE loan and be compelled to change my daily meals to plain rice with light soy sauce, why would I want that? Others may beg to differ but that's your problem.

Nothing wrong with the path you choose. Good for you, as long as you are happy.
 
Like you, I would never commit to any loans that will make me downgrade my lifestyle and lose sleep for fear of job loss..to me, that obviously meant overstretching.
 
On the flip side, most of my friends and associates who are doing well are very happy (they can always choose to lead a simple life), I believe if you ask those banker friends or ex colleagues of yours if they would want to "downgrade" their lifestyle and work in a 8-5 desk bound job earning a measly fixed pay a month, do you think they want?

so jialat meh, your rich friends?
 
many materially rich ppl i know are also very happy with their lives. Not because of the big houses or fanciful cars they own. But because they have a happy family, good friends, good health and God in their hearts.
 
so i believe it's not your job, salary or how financially prudent you are that makes you happy

 
Do you think these "doing well" friends will admit n confess that they "hate themselves and their lifestyle" ??

 
bring u one corner and smash their ROO on the ground with tears streaming down their faces, then confess that they secretly hate all the things they bought with their money that was earned working 100 hours a week in an investment bank

Actually whether you are rich or poor, you are never free of problems.
 
Rich people also have their problems and worries. And usually their problems/worries cannot be solved by money. This is what I gather from people I know who are well off.
 
End of the day, be contented and live happily is the best.

Just a thought... it seems like quite a number of people here thinks that people who do well in life mostly hate themselves and their lifestyle.Those people not doing well are happy and blissful people?

Not really. As I have mentioned, everyone has its own problems, whether rich or poor.

that's a really good one! I was really laughing upon reading this. I do concede that not all of them hate themselves but amongst the five close buddies, all of them hate their job scope despite being extremely well-remunerated. So  I suppose you have a gungho/commando/navy seal midset in just abt every decision/purchase u make? well, good for you then.
 
And whilst I do look back upon my decisions in departing company with the law firm and subsequently the private bank, I never did regret the move. granted that I could have made so much more $ but do I really need to have private housing, XMMs to date (still pondering), exotic cars to drive and APs to wear? 
 
Some people are so poor cos all they have is money.
If there's ever a decision I regret in making, it would be the purchase of a dumb sea-dweller in 2007. cannot fathom the stupidity or rationale in me that led me to spend so much in a stupid watch when I could always rely on my nokia hp to tell me the time. For crying out loud, I dun even dive so why would i freaking need a dive watch?!

I believe these people are not the real rich ones (yet). Yes, they may be earning a lot, but also have a lot of commitments to keep up with the lifestyles and Joneses.
 
As long as you need to slog day in day out to keep up your lifestyles, you are not rich. Just a slave albielt with higher income than the rest of the population.
 
The true rich are rare. They need not work, but income just flow in.

bring u one corner and smash their ROO on the ground with tears streaming down their faces, then confess that they secretly hate all the things they bought with their money that was earned working 100 hours a week in an investment bank

questions:
 
1.What is the avg PSF price for this lakeview?
 
2. why buy EC when cannot hold on to hdb? i would have thought holding on to HDB and own a private condo for rental yield may be more attractive?

If stay private and rent out hdb then rental yield could be 8 to 10%.
 
If stay hdb and rent private then rental yield about 4%.
 
Just estimated

Nothing wrong with wanting to improve one's life. Humans live on hope. The question is ... how does moving to EC immediately equates to improving lifestyle ? There are many popular and realistic factors that could improve lifestyle, better living space, better surroundings, better commute to work, better commute to school, near to desired amenities etc. If the EC in question provides all these, then sure. If moving to EC means smaller living space, far from work, far from school, .... where is the quality of life you are talking about ?
 

Am I being kiasi or simply being realistic/financially prudent? I'd like to think of it as the latter. Some may even say that this is the classical case of 'sour grapes' owing to my adamant refusal to move on/change. Everyone is entitled to their opinon. End of the day: It's my money.
 
I adhere to this rule in life: The environment will NEVER adapt to suit you. You MUST either adapt or be phased out, that is the truth. No two-ways about it. When I was in Cambodia some years back,  I saw a 4yr old boy with his family looking for stuff (I have no idea what!) in a mountain of trash (yes, really a mountain!) I stood from a distance and watched...there was NOT a tinge of anger or resentment amongst the family members and there were also several families scavenging for stuff (really quite a sight to behold). The smell was simply horrendous and I'm cocksure they felt the same way under the scorching sun...but life has to go on. Is Pol Pot going to crawl out of HELL and say to this family: I am sorry for causing the genocide and the hardship u & yr families r gg through?  In retrospect, anyone in sillypore kena forced to upgrade to private housing like EC/condo owing to external pressure (Wife's constant nagging not counted hor)? Pls share cos I would really like to hear about how one can be 'coerced' into upgrading.
 
I look at some of my old buddies who are still in the legal & banking industries, do I envy them during gatherings? Yes of course! for the condo penthhouse they stay in, exotic cars they drive, the XMMs (local somemore!) they date and the wondrous AP ROO watches they don. Are they truly happy? NO. Many of them hate themselves and their lifestyles, endless travelling, 24-7 on standby, hp must be on and the list goes on. Can they opt out of the ratrace? Unfortunately cannot cos everything all on installment. Even the XMMs also on installment...go figure. Housing and car loans alone already enuff to maim and even possibly kill.
 
So am I kiasi or just acting out of financial prudence? I would admit a bit of both. My first job was in a law firm and I celebrated my 25th & 26th b'day as well as X'mas eve in the High Court with my senior partners and the Judge. Luckily the DC was also in the Courtroom to keep me company. Then I moved on to bank and kena arrow London market so whilst I worked, my family was asleep. That went on for three years, gained 15kg cos it's work,eat,sleep & repeat. The money was definitely wonderful but my life was in pieces. Got the life to earn BUT must also have the life to spend. Back then, if I had committed to a condo, think I would still be in the bank now.
 
So do I feel contented now? God has been extremely kind to me so I definitely cannot complain that life is no good. I sleep with a peaceful mind on a queen size bed not having to worry abt the loans I have to service. Is being contented synonymous with kiasi? To some, maybe but to each his own. At the end of the day, staying in my teeny-weeny hdb flat and be happy with family is of paramount importance to me. To trade my flat for EC/condo, start another HUGE loan and be compelled to change my daily meals to plain rice with light soy sauce, why would I want that? Others may beg to differ but that's your problem.

Agree, we all need hope to progress.
 
Also, quality of life means different things to people. Its not about housing size and location = good lifestyle. Lol, to some, good life means living in the mountains, fresh air, organic food, no stress, no noise.
 
I for one, do not like to stay landed. To me, shifting from a HDB flat right smack in the town center to a landed property with limited amenities and direct MRT access = a downgrade of quality of life... To most Singaporeans.. I'm just out of my mind.

Yup. Its all up to individual. Whether stay in the mountains (all alone with fresh air), or in HDB (in conventiently located town centre) or a bungalow out in a rural place (but with an expensive car), there are pros and cons. Its how to adapt to it and enjoy it. 
 
There is no right or wrong. Its all in your mind.

I think generally ppl calculate without include the interest. But I do agree interest is relatively big portion for few hundreds K over 10 over years.

just login into cpf and see my statement > $$ used for property
whatever the sum is ... that sum earns interest every year until you pay back all the sum + accrued interest
it does not matter you fully settled or not
unless you mean you pay back all the sum + accrued interest back to cpf

Just use the monthly rental minus the monthly interest and divided by $300k. Then you get the yield.

you redeem your loan but you have not paid the "interest" that the lump sum you taken out from cpf that should earn interest every day if you "have not" use that lump sum. beside, your monthly contribution if have not been used to service loan, it should have earned interest too.
 
nothing to do with loan redemption
 
like i said ... must change the perception that why i pay interest to use "my money" to pay for "my property"
 
cpf money is a fund (by policy) ...
govt use govt pay interest into cpf ...
you use you pay interest into cpf ...
straight apple-to-apple comparison
as simple as that

Ya. Esp now when loan interest is lower than CPF rate, best to leave the $$ inside. Ah gong will pay me 2.5% interest. If take out to use, i hv to pay myself 2.5% interest. I know who i rather earn the interest from......

don't worry about the accumulated interest lah
 
if you don't sell, when you turn 55, only the min sum is transferred to RA.  the rest you can withdraw
 
if you sell, the full sum can be taken out again for your next property purchase

A bit pointless asking whether to buy EC or not whether discussing the point of doing it.
 
Nobody can predict the property market 10 years down the road. However TS's aim seem to be earning 500K from the EC.
Just do it if your risk appetite is good and you can afford the extra monthly loan. Calculated risk. Calculate your sums and see if the risks is worth it according to your risk profile. 
 
If "upgrading" to EC is because of the upgrade in living, then this is open for debate. Of course EC nicer than HDB. The distance of this particular EC however is 5 bus stops away from the MRT. If your current HDB is a short walk away, then this is downgrade.
 
If the new EC is smaller in size than the HDB, this is also downgrade.
 
If you move to EC and have jiaklat neighbours. Then this is super downgrade. In my mind, good neighbours add 10% to my HDB value.

But stay in EC got swimming pool, gym, tennis court at your doorstep. And security too, so no ah long to bother you. That is an upgrade from HDB.

Think I got it wrong. Yield should be annual rental divided by the purchase price. So if bought for $300k , with month rental of $2.5k, then the yield should be 10%. That's why I don't think that buying EC is a good idea because rental yield from hdb is good. 
 
Should instead get a private condo, use the hdb rental to help cover installment. For don't know what reasons, why the government allow private properties owners to own Hdb flat.

Some quick and simple maths.
 
Assume you take up a loan of S$500,000 for 20 years to buy that EC.
 
Interests payment at the end of 10 years will be around S$100,000. I assume 3.5% interest ...... this is not exactly the most prudent.
 
Monthly payment to service loan about S$3000.
 
 
So after 10 years and you managed to sell at S$1.5M, you will earn about $400,000 after deducting interest. Maybe S$350,000 if factor in renovation etc. 
 
Potential gain S$350,000. Monthly payment S$3000.
 
The gain attractive or not? Can tahan another S$3000 loan a month for next 10 years or not?
 
BIGGER QUESTION. When you sell for S$1.5M you cannot but HDB for 30 months. You gotto pay rent for somewhere to stay even if you intend to move back into resale HDB. Rental at S$2500 for 30 months means expense of S$75,000. So your net gain not even S$300,000.
 
If you intend to upgrade again, the price of another private property that is not EC type sure higher. Can afford?
 
Buy back HDB 5 room 13 years later........... also uncertain. That HDB you sold at S$500,000 may now be higher too.
 
 
BUT if staying in private very important to you .............. then what the heck. Just buy la. Nobody here can tell you for what will happen in 10 years time.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Cannot buy from HDB or take grant for 30 months right?? Buy Resales without subsidary still can right?

Yield should be based on market price (i.e. the price you can get if you sell the flat).
 
Eg, If someone bought apple stock at 50$ and it is now 600$. Apple give 30$ dividend doesn't mean the yield is 60% right? You should count your 30$ dividend against the current stock price.

You can't pay the ticket, can't board the boat.

 
Yield should be based on market price (i.e. the price you can get if you sell the flat).
 
Eg, If someone bought apple stock at 50$ and it is now 600$. Apple give 30$ dividend doesn't mean the yield is 60% right? You should count your 30$ dividend against the current stock price.

Rental Yield is on what you invested on the property. If your property gain, then that is called something like capital gain. So what you said is current yield, which of course changes due to market price different.

Partagas, those kind of people are not rich, they are merely well paid. As you say, wealthy people don't have to work also have money to spend.

Buy within your means and take a loan quantum that you're comfortable. 
 
Other people borrow more to buy more expensive house is your problem? 
 
If everyone followed your thinking, everyone in MCF will be driving a Toyota Hiace (HDB) ...and nobody will be buying a Merc A (EC) Class.
 
Why so bitter until need to justify your decision by assuming your friends/ colleagues are making the "wrong" decision?

You can't pay the ticket, can't board the boat.
.

Haha of course can't board the boat for the full voyage.. But not enough to total miss the entire journey when I managed to save a small tiny sum towards late 2000s. 
 
But I envy those who made the journey and try to learn from it. Rather than ranting and assuming how big is the debt trap, how unhappy is it, and telling the forum how contented is it to have a fully paid up property. It is good but one men's meat is another men's poison, beauty in the eyes of the beholder.
 
I mean it
Partagas, those kind of people are not rich, they are merely well paid. As you say, wealthy people don't have to work also have money to spend.well said.. But lots of wealthy people are still working damn hard... Whether working harder compared to somebody out there, I'm not sure, but definitely Working much harder than me.. I already finished dinner and at home gonna play with my kids.
Yes i think so too.
 
 
Can you be my Sifu, Sifu?
sifu, you are your own sifu.. Just be open and listen. A wise man says that he listens more than he talks..

Anyway I'm sure all of us work hard at work, or invest prudently or aggressively for our next generation, if not at least to cater for retirement.. 
 
Some people choose to have a fully paid up flat and take BMW..bus mrt walk everyday.. Some chooses to buy a nice car, some buy cheap car, some buy private property, take too much loan, no $$ buy car, some buy private property , takes lots of loan and still take more loan buy nice car, some don't take loan, don't buy car.. Etc etc.. No right or wrong because it's "their" money.. 
 
Why need to impose own value compass on others $$?
 
Maybe your friends are all fake ranting.. Say so stress so stress, buy condo buy ec buy landed, take big loan no $.. But actually bluff one, actually inside bank account got lots of $$ just that interest so low don't take sayang.. So investing the cash and took loan? But says poor to everyone so that no one will wanna borrow $$ from them?
It's a car forum for god sake so all don't get too serious ya

Like one bro said, rich or dun rich also got happy and unhappiness.
 
Money is not a gauge for happiness.
 
Got one saying in Chinese, 快来不是得到多少，而是放下多少。Happiness is not how much you gain but how much you willing to let go.
A lot of people thought that the money is the root of all evil.. Actually the love for money is the root of all evil. 
This sentence too deep for me "happiness is not how much you gain but how much you willing to let go"
Too profound. I don't usually search for the meaning of happiness.. Happiness means good mood, lesser worry. unhappiness means mood no good, more worries. Sorry but I don't understand the thing about searching for the meaning of life etc etc.. My neighbour lead their own life, I lead my own.. If one day he needs my help, can help I help, cannot help I also no choice. If one day I need help after I help him, he can help he help, he cannot help I also wouldn't tulang him.

Back to talking about EC upgrade. 
I visit some friends staying at EC. I cant help but feel that people are trying to show off to each other and environment not very friendly.   From the neighbors glance , it is just very discomforting.  
Maybe its just me .....sigh...inferiority complex....

Due to printing of money...our money is devalued. Hence housing prices shot up. It's happening everywhere all over the world.
 
Why? Coz people rushed in to park their money in both non tangible and physical assets.
 
Asian love for property means everyone rushes in the property game.
 
There is such a thing between good debt n poor debt. If you opt to stay status quo..earn money n let it stay devalued in the bank...so be it. The value of money gets eroded over time.
 
So called safe bonds masquerading as insurance etc are not doing well.
 
Rule of thumb... As long as didn't over leverage should invest as much as possible.
 
As regards to debt free... N achieve true financial freedom... As long as you need to work even if you stay in a fully paid hdb or condo..you are never financial free.
 
People buy second property to invest to rent out for passive income.some buy to multiply the value n then liquidate to invest in other investment instruments.
 
As long you are young...I think its safe to invest but within your means.

As to buying an EC..it can be an attractive investment as long as you don't over leverage.
 
But be mindful is that unlike hdb the quantum of investment is high..meaning you are stuck paying for it..and although the value may grow over time you can't liquidate it as you need to live in it.
 
However since you already have a hdb...I would think you should keep it..and buy a one bedder or two bedder condo as investment.
 
Delay your upgrade plans for a while longer. Liquidate the condo for cash when time is right.

Anyone still think current EC purchase can gain 500k profit from selling down the road?
It's getting tougher to own a private ppty liao.
Everyone are predicting mtk correction is coming soon, but even if the day were to come, do you think we can still buy?
I don't think many will still buy as ABSD will hit the rich multiple ppty owners as they still buay song paying taxes.. 
LTV + ABSD + TDSR hit 2nd home investors.
MSR hit first timer.
MSR/TDSR + levy/sale proceed hit BTO/EC upgrader.
LTV with high up front hit over leverage buyer.
Getting older, got hit by shorter tenure period plus the minimum sum cum RA thing kicks in.

Ask yourself first :
- why you want to buy an EC ?
- after you buy an EC, will you be servicing your loan for a longer period of time ?
- after you move into an EC, will you fully use the facilities ?

buy $300k, fully paid up at $425k (at least)
 
so, should use $300k or $425k to calculate the yield?

 
Should always use current valuation for yield. So, it is apple to apple comparisons for properties that you do not own.
 
Using cost of funds is ROI. Switching a fully paid HDB to a condo will have a higher ROI if you are gearing it fully! Problem with a fully paid HDB is you cant leverage it to improve ROI.

forgot this point.. Assume one bought a HDB sometime ago at 500k, fully paid up, now market price is 1mil at 100% appreciation. Another bought a 1 mil private, fully paid up, now market price never move and still at 1mil. If both of them needs liquidity for investment or urgent needs.. 1 must sell hdb to encash even though there is a 500k profit.. 1 can refinance 80% of the value without needing to sell off..

Yes now EC also kanna MSR liao. 
 
Developers have to build smaller units maybe max 4 bedroom with higher psf else the bank cannot loan too much then buyer need to fork out more cash.

Yes. Husband or wife buy over the other party share of the house. Usually apply to avoid ABSD.

Can sell after MOP of 5 years (To Singaporean/PR only) so should be 5 years?
 
ABSD isn't mean to be a long term measure so I'm not even sure if it will be around 5 years from now.

Not forgetting to add about 3 years for the EC to build if you buying new. Hence from you buy new till MOP the lock in period is about 8 years time.

This one better than pay full cash.....cos you paid in advance! ha ha ha

 

 
I also contemplating to whether to buy Lake Life EC. My friend bought this Whitewater EC at Pasir Ris and now he made more than 100% profit leh. So I think EC still got potential.
 
I met this agent at Jurong Point where she was giving out flyer and she told me to visit her website. Got articles about EC and I think quite. U can go see see.
 
www.lakelifeec.org
 
She mentioned the nearby private already going for psf around $1.1 to $1.3k. She say this EC psf should be about $850 to $900. If compare the prices with nearby condo I think this one quite attractive leh. But my loan got issue cos of the 30% MSR and I intend to get a 4 bedroom unit. Now I need to find cash... 
 
I can confirm no resale levy for this one cos land bought before the new rule. Her website also say no levy leh. Me and my spouse also exceed 12k cos of OT pay. But she say OT not computed towards the 12k unless the allowance is receive on regular basis then must take into consideration. So for our case can still go through. 
 
The below is taken from hub website. 
http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10321p.nsf/w/BuyingNewFlatIncomeGuideline?OpenDocument
Income/Allowance considered
Examples of income / allowance that are considered in the computation of household income are:
Pension
Stipend
Sustenance
Allowances (fixed/variable) received on a regular basis (eg transport, food, laundry, uniform, etc)
Income/Allowance not considered
Examples of income / allowance that are not considered in the computation of household income are:
Rental income
Interest from fixed deposit/savings account
Alimony allowance (divorce cases)
Bonuses
Director fees
Scholarship overseas allowance
Income earned from overtime work
National Service Allowance
 
She also did a calculation on the spot for me to show me roughly how much my max loan is and my monthly mortgage. I am quite impressed cos many agents i come across always say find banker call me. Don't know is it cos got some referral fee or what. 
 
She got say if exceed difficult to appeal for this jurong ec especially since Jurong is so hot. If other new ecs maybe still can try. Think you can contact her and ask.

 

 
Wow......so attractive!!!!!
Die die must buy......
So u sign and confirm the unit already?

u can also be impressed with me (unless u are the agent herself) cos i can also calculate roughly on the spot how much is your monthly mortgage
 
and yes, there is referral fee for bank loans. I can share 90% of it with u cos i am desperate for sales these days, u know, the market is tanking

To me, some who cant afford EC even, this is all very wrong.
 
EC is to fulfill those aspiring singaporeans who cant afford real condo.
 
Instead people are using ECs to make money intentionally.....they do this to even HDB.  On govt subsidies , somemore.....  Its all very wrong.
 
But who am i to comment, i am only a peasant as they call it here right?
I read up quite a fair bit since joining.....

Thats why, when there is true recession with retrenchment, i think this time, many will die cock stand compared to before.  Moreover so many cheaper FTs can take those places.  Pray, that doesnt ever happen.

Pray, that doesnt ever happen.i experienced 1997, retrenched after 8 months in first job after graduation.. Had Maggie mee n plain bread for prolong period and still have to pay $400 per month room rental even no job.. Took up odd jobs like work in supermarket, temp at call centers.. Went through 2000 dotcom bubble, 2001 911, 2003 SARS, 2008/9 credit crisis, 2011 Europe crisis.. Wouldn't die one lah 
My 2 cents verdict.. These are macro crisis where we can't avoid.. Be ready, be prepared, but definitely don't have to be paranoid bec they can't be avoided or prevented by Singapore alone. Take crisis as opportunity to make some $$.. As Chinese words says.. 危机.. 危险产生机会

I am not referrimg to cash rich folks with a healthy saving. I am talking abt borderline families with little or not that much savings dreaming abt owing a EC. hDB not good enough meh? 
 
Selling existing flat for 500k doesnt mean you shd 'upgrade' to an EC if your income still qualify to buy one. If you "qualify" to buy one, that mean you cannot "afford" one. Of course, if you have 6 fig savings, dif story. Take the risk and maybe can profit from a recovering economy. 
 
My young 24 yr old staff told me one day that she was sad that she didnt manage to ballot successfully for a Duxton flat costing over 600k. I told her she shd be happy that she didnt. I was paying her $2200 a mth and her hucband was earning like $3300. 
 
End of day, can be ambitious, but dun try to wear a bigger hat than one's head and try to look better than the other Joe.

One should be ambitious to achieve economic goals. None of the world richest men are not ambitious. When you are young, you should be more ambitious and at a point of age then be more passive to protect your investment portfolio. 
 
If your 24 yr old staff do get the Duxton flat, she can sell that now for a million. Or else how to achieve 6 fig saving with peanut pay? At the end of the day, it basically boils down to the risk appetite of that person and the aim of his retirement age. 
 
That's why there is a movie called 'Young And Dangerous'!

People always think positively when they commit, and having a "it won't happen to me" mentality. So losing job or health isn't what they are expecting, hence buy lah.

those ec fellows usually are very near 12k one
usually are upgraders who had full paid their hdb, then sell at about say $400k
plus somemore they already paid 20% downpayment already
so say ec cost 1m, - 20%, - 400k
so loan 400k
for middle age couple of say 40 years old, 12k income, 400k i think can clear within 10 years
50 years old, debt free again

you are born into a good life so you cannot imagine
 
but i can tell you for sure that the couple, with proper financial prudence and planning, can achieve a 6 figure savings with time

IMHO, EC shld be for 1st timers. Upgraders who hv oredi profited a few hundred k from their first hdb shld be competing in the pte mkt, not competing wif new entrants wif smaller treasure chests.

not entirely true
 
1. many young couple salary below $12k whack EC because they think buy toyota sell lexus after MOP 5 years. this group of buyer is increasing rapidly
 
2. upgrader who sold their hdb ... they normally cash out the profit and they do not plonk $400k to the EC. they would love to cash out $100k-$150k and take on more loan for the EC
 
of course ... sensible and play safe type will plonk as much as possible into the EC and settle the loan in the shortest period
 
1st timer buy EC if nothing goes wrong in life for 5 years ... profitablity is high ... let's say buy at 30-35 with a 10 years early headstart compare to upgrader
 
upgrader age 40-45 buy EC ... i don't see a point especially the hdb is already fully paid up unless living in EC is a die die must have

Its not that i am born into good life,in fact that i am not born in a silver spoon, only during my secondary school days my parent getting better financially.
 
Even if u r born with silver spoon, one will still to take risk when he was young just that they are taking the bigger risks than average joe. 
 
That is why in invesment most of the young are more aggressive in their investment portfolio.

Share my personal story... graduated in 05.. early 06 with minute savings+wife's CPF... went for a 400k 3bdroom condo in CCK...  owned that place until 2010 and sold it at 720k to leverage and buy current place. 
 
To us.. the rationale was simple... HDB back then also cost 3xxk same size same area.. no point have to lock in 5years... many people.. including bosses like yourself, my parents etc told us we were overstretching to own a house (mkt was slowly recovering then). And yes.. really damn xiong the first year.. But 2nd year till the 5th year.. we rented out the place. Stayed with parents and waited for property to appreciate. 
 
Don't forget everyone's pay is should appreciate over time... fresh out of school can afford on combined pay..吃点苦..
should try la
 
In hindsight.. there is really a fine line between trying to wear bigger hat... and being ambitious... No one knows for sure how property prices will move in 3yrs.. let alone 5~10years.. But one thing for sure.. if you dont take risks.. 按部就班... its much much more difficult to survive...

usually new couple will buy 2-3 room
upgrader, minimum is 4 room, most prefer jumbo size or penthouse
for upgrader staying in a 90sqm hdb, a 3 room and below is already a downgrade in size, dont say those un usable area

Nowadays.. houses are really meant to be retirement nest eggs. Gone are the days when house can be fully paid up in few years of ownership..
 
look to future.. don't just look at the past and complain. move with the changing world

oh yes.. of cus! the house is owned by the bank!    At current price... abt 50% loan

Density very high and environment quite "chup" type.
But good thing more convenient than CCK for sure.

For me, the reason is more of facilities, and the not very useful security . Not good also better than none.

one question ....so now do you have a much bigger debt on your current place than when you bought your first place?
 
not judging you of course...no offence

 
I believe not all debt is bad... it is not possible for most people to pay for their property in cash, especially the younger couples. 
 
As long as they are not over leveraging, can keep up a good quality of life, have enough for savings and investments, Why not? Especially when you see a good buy coming along.

There is no different if the timing is right.
 
I saw a couple earning 5k a month buying 5 condo all on bank loan and yet get approved. We call them Xiao, cause they over leverage. But they over leverage at the right time that there is zero risk to them.

many ppl still cannot differentiate between good debt and bad debt and the concept of using good debt to gain leverage. to them, a fully paid off hdb seems to be the sole financial goal in life. but that's good - less competition in the marketplace.

One should aim to be nett debt free, not just debt free. That is you have more assets than debts. To be just debt free but with very little assets is still a poor person after all.
 
So what's nett debt free? I.e. A person with $300k cash but a $200k HDB loan is nett debt free. He can actually pay off his debt anytime he wants but did not do so. He can now invest his $300k wisely and is very likely to get above 2.6% (HDB Loan) or 1+% (Bank Loan).

HDB always < private..  when price difference < 200k ... buy private.. anything bigger.. buy HDB

Those 40 years old HDB could be en-bloc? 
Looks like more HDB out there are turning 40 soon, doubt HDB going to en-bloc all of them.
 
But to opt for upgrading, for a 2nd timer it looks very difficult now but as one drag longer the loan tenure get shorter.
 
The market cycle could be different when we keep thinking it's going to be over supply, on the other hand more n more ppl could have the cash n CPF but still not enuff to upgrade to condo due to stagnant HDB resale price n ageing ppty on hand.
 
Newer n younger ppty looks more appealing to high income earner n life style is just wat they r looking for.

very common that parents will help with 20% to 30% of the EC
 
these couple typically quite young - late 20s to early 30s. To them, the future is bright and they are confident that in a few years time, each will be earning 10k
 
 
economic cycles is a fact of life
 
pray like mad also cannot change the fact
 
 
saw a jumbo, 1900 sqft, 6 bedrooms. nicely renovated and asking 888,000
 
but location like crap
 
nearby got a 1200 sqft resale condo asking 800,000
 
which better value? The 20 year old jumbo or 10 year old condo?  

Wah the jumbo flat know the market or not? Ask for fun?

As long as you are staying in the property it's not really an assert. Coz after u liquid it u still need to find a place to stay.
 
If buy high for stay not worth it
Cos in the end still need to find a cheap place to stay after liquidating the place.
 
To see over leverage or not... Look at your net assert.
 
If after considering All the debt you have taken up n you still +ve should be safe.

I know of many earning more than 12k still a lot of debt; car loan ec or condo loan.
 
However I also know of those debt free with fully paid hdb n a pile of cash sitting in the bank with combined pay of less than 12k.
 
Lots of ppl when their pay upgrade they upgrade their lifestyle aka spending too.

I still remember in the 2007, my collegue who as staying in EC was telling me that his house is worth less than what he paid for. And advising me against getting a EC because of the poor location.
 
Fast forward to today, he made quite abit from the sales of his EC and moved to a bigger place at a more convenient location.
 
Some forumers have claimed that they made quite abit off their EC , even though they struggled with the payment in the first few years.
 
At the end of the day, the BIG question you need to ask yourself. How long you can tong if mkt/situation move against your favour? What is your backup plan. Be it that you have mama and papa to go back to  or saving to pay off the mthly mortagage. If you could pull off  for at least 3 yrs. It's probably worth the risk... 
 
If you are >40+, no saving , no parent's home to run back to..Bro, It's not worth the risk.
 
If you are young and just married, do consider the primary school nearby if you are having children......... ha ha ha :P Your children will be the next bigger factor for you to forgo profit.

Location helps as well but more importantly your points on having a safety net is a good reminder to all of us, thanks!!

Rightfully yes, but if you make 1 dollar more than the cap, it is easy to appeal or even tell your boss to lower your salary by 1 buck?

 
Can minus MVC or not in this case? haha...

I still remember in the 2007, my collegue who as staying in EC was telling me that his house is worth less than what he paid for. And advising me against getting a EC because of the poor location.
 
Fast forward to today, he made quite abit from the sales of his EC and moved to a bigger place at a more convenient location.
 
Some forumers have claimed that they made quite abit off their EC , even though they struggled with the payment in the first few years.
 
At the end of the day, the BIG question you need to ask yourself. How long you can tong if mkt/situation move against your favour? What is your backup plan. Be it that you have mama and papa to go back to  or saving to pay off the mthly mortagage. If you could pull off  for at least 3 yrs. It's probably worth the risk... 
 
If you are >40+, no saving , no parent's home to run back to..Bro, It's not worth the risk.
 
If you are young and just married, do consider the primary school nearby if you are having children......... ha ha ha :P Your children will be the next bigger factor for you to forgo profit.

 
In Singapore as long as you hold the property for at least 10 years and as long as you are not force to sell. I think 99% would make money.
 
Land cost, labour cost, building material cost all going up every year. In our limited land island, sell the property which bought at least 10 years ago shouldn't make any loss.

the question is
 
1. if you sell and buy an equal property means you pay more based on your logic land, labour and material cost goes up
 
2. if you sell and upgrade ... you need to pay more unless you have planned to upgrade anyway
 
3. if you sell and move to a smaller and ulu place ... you actually downgrade unless you have planned to downgrade
 
unless you have multiple properties ... flipping the property you are living is not straightforward

Make $$ only if your consider purchase price to selling price..
 
If you consider replacement cost,  dun think it will be alot.. and add in inflation, the money really dun look a lot.
 
For you only home,  buy where you are comfortable staying forever.. If you chance to upgrade, then do it.. If you dont, it;s still good.

Correct. This apply to 2nd property n above. 
 
If only one property for own stay then when old liao sell away n buy a resale hdb. Fully paid off still got pocket money for old age. Many ppl doing that.

EC confirmed make money one......... 
 
land is cheaper than private, price is cheaper than private, no need to pay so much cash upfront, only 5%.  
Those qualified for housing grant, will get the this additional benefit
 
and EC prices is pegged with private nearby, not HDB.  
 
how to not make money from EC? 
 
Today, if you look at all resale EC for sale in the open market, after they are 5 yrs or 10 yrs old.... which one is selling at a loss?  NONE
 
Their open market prices are pegged v closely to private.

EC tied to 30% MSR....
at cap of 12k, can only use max of 4k to service loan every month. if lower salary, then can only loan less.
 
ec prices are now at most 20% disc to private in same location. so easily 1M & above for 3 bedder

PC speculated to $1,250 psf for $1.25M for 1001sqft and EC 20% disc = close to $1M looks like a steal but it is NOT
the 20% disc comes with many limitations and poorer quality compare to PC
EC is actually selling at a premium as high as PC or even higher after take in the considerations of 10 years to acquire PC status

  its about timing.... u buy EC at peak and sell at trough... how to make $$? 
 
Even if you sell at par... ur loan interests will wipe out your grants at the start... 
 
5years is a loooong time to be locked in... especially at this juncture..

U both have a point! I agree with Donut is confirmed make money but I also agree with Wt know that EC comes with cheaper quality finishings and more importantly the 10yr PC status discounts the profit in that sense.
 

My conclusion is that yes it's confirmed make money but over a long term and for risk adverse guys this is a good investment IMO but of course if you the gung ho want to make money fast type then maybe private is the way to go but beware of the risk hor and like most people say timing is very impt esp for private.

its actually more than 20% discount. if u look at price per feet.
 
Today's new ECs are selling at $730-800 per sq ft, from 3 bedder to 5 bedder.
 
there is not much limitations on EC, the only thing is the MOP, which is quite reasonable.  How many of us actually move house before 5 years? what's the %?

anyway, everyone has their own benchmark and appetite ... so to each his own
just take the latest EC LakeLife @ Yuan Ching road ... sounds sibei good ... but location location location compare to all the PC surrounding Lakeside MRT (caspian, lakefront, lakeshore, lakeview, etc) ... of course Lakelife is cheaper .... but ... is it?

if like the LakeLife EC ... what FT want to live there?
anyway, during SARS and Lehman period ... i think HDB got give chance in terms of defer payment or extension something like that
if take private bank loan ... all banks are blood suckers ... ho say liao

There are factors to consider lah..
1) location
2) overall demand - population growth vs vacancy
 
There is no sure bet in 5-10 yrs. In a flat mkt, your gain will probably be just inline with inflation.

You may have a 20%-30% discount based on prices of PC nearby but even at the end of 10 years, there will be some difference in the prices (even accounting for location and quality differences).
 
Lastly, it is not "sure make money" if housing prices fall more than 20-30%.
 
FYI, I bought a Woodlands EC last year and I'm still concerned about housing prices.

 
say... general economy collapse.. EC owner lose job.. cannot upkeep EC mthly payments during MOP... any bro here knows wat will happen?

 
Not sure but I think it should be the same as a PC?
 
Anyway, one should always make sure they have strong finances and watch out for cash flow.  You can be making 20k a month but how much are you spending? And how much of that spending can be cut easily if you do lose your job?
 
Lastly, you should always have some savings of liquid cash to tide over in cash of job loss. With interest rates this low, please do not put all your cash to pay off your loan. It is better to take as much loan as you can even if your return on the money is *slightly* less than what the bank is charging you for borrowing it.

Why should anyone promise you that your job and house will always be safe? If you make poor decisions, you should suffer for it.
 
I can't stand people who blame government for all their problems when it is their poor performance and decision that is to blame. I support a small government doesn't stick their nose in my life but it seems the majority of Singaporeans are for big government as they want the government to plan everything for them.

1. Honestly speaking, location for ECs are all shit. You want good location with this price, you need to buy a HDB
2. Everyone is expecting a housing glut in the next year of so but I think the magnitude of the fall will still depend on the general economy.

the demand now are ppl that genuinely wants to stay in the place or keep the place for a long long time.
 
there are a lot of things to consider than capital gain. e.g. family conveniences , amenity , school , neighbourhood, transport options.
 
Aniway.. those who stay at places like Loyang valley will have their days again when even if they advertise 30% below value .. also no one come and view. Cos there is simply so much options.

	Staggered downpayment for new HDB flats starting from September BTO exercise

 
Wednesday, Sep 24, 2014
Janice Heng
The Straits Times



SINGAPORE - Existing Housing Board flat owners who buy a new two- or three-room flat in a non-mature estate can now choose to pay only half the required downpayment upfront, and the rest later. This staggered downpayment takes effect from the September Build-to-Order exercise, which began on Wednesday.
Get the full story from The Straits Times.
Here is the press release from HDB:
Today, HDB launched 4,630 new flats under the September 2014 Build-To-Order (BTO) exercise. These flats are spread across six projects located in the non-mature towns of Bukit Batok, Hougang and Jurong West, and the mature town of Kallang Whampoa.
Staggered Downpayment Scheme for Right-sizing to 2-room or 3-room Flats
Starting from this BTO exercise, existing flat owners who right-size to a new 2- room or 3-room flat in a non-mature town/estate can choose to pay half the downpayment for the new flat when they sign the Agreement for Lease:
a. For those who are not taking up a loan or who are taking up an HDB loan, they need to pay only a 5% downpayment upfront, instead of the current 10%;
b. For those who are taking up a loan with Financial Institutions, they need to pay only a 10% downpayment upfront, instead of the current 20%. They need only pay the other half together with the balance purchase price of the new flat when they collect the keys for the new flat. This staggered downpayment arrangement aims to assist flat owners who wish to right-size to a new flat but have their funds tied up in the existing flat.
September 2014 BTO exercise
A wide range of flats, comprising Studio Apartments (SAs), 2-room to 5-room flats, as well as Three-Generation (3Gen) flats, is offered to meet the diverse housing needs of first-timers, second-timers, multi-generation families, elderly and singles.
First-timers will continue to enjoy priority flat allocation, with at least 85% (for 4- room and 5-room flats) and 70% (for 2-room and 3-room flats) of the BTO public flat supply set aside for them. Eligible first-timer singles have the option of applying for a 2- room flat in Buangkok Square, West Terra @ Bukit Batok, Yung Ho Spring I, or Yung Ho Spring II.
Married/courting couples who wish to live together with their parent(s) can apply for a 3Gen flat at Buangkok Edgeview. Other multi-generation families who wish to live near each other in the same BTO project can apply under the Multi-Generation Priority Scheme (MGPS) for a flat in Buangkok Square, St George's Towers, West Terra @ Bukit Batok, Yung Ho Spring I, or Yung Ho Spring II.
50% of the SAs at St George's Towers in Kallang Whampoa will be set aside under the Studio Apartment Priority Scheme (SAPS) for seniors who apply for an SA in the same town or within 2 km of their current flat/property, or for an SA to live near or with their parents/married child.
Eligible first-timer families can enjoy up to $60,000 of housing grants, comprising the Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) (up to $40,000) and the Special CPF Housing Grant (SHG) (up to $20,000). With these grants, 2-room, 3-room, 4-room and 5-room flats can be purchased from $18,000, $115,000, $222,000 and $333,000 respectively.

Applicants are strongly advised to apply for a BTO flat in non-mature towns to enjoy a higher chance of success in securing a flat.
Regular updates on the number of applications submitted for the various flat types/towns will be published on the HDB InfoWEB. Applicants are advised to check for updates before submitting their application.
Application for September 2014 BTO Exercise
Application for new flats launched in the September 2014 BTO exercise can be submitted online on the HDB InfoWEB from today, 24 September 2014 (Wednesday) to 30 September 2014 (Tuesday). Applicants can apply for only one flat type in one town.
For enquiries, the public can:
- Log on to esales.hdb.gov.sg; or - E-mail hdbsales@mailbox.hdb.gov.sg; or- Visit the HDB Sales Office to speak with our Customer Relations Executives during office hours (Monday to Friday 8 am to 5 pm, Saturday 8 am to 1 pm).
In November 2014, HDB will offer about 4,290 BTO flats in Sembawang, Sengkang, Tampines and Yishun.
An additional 3,000 flats will be offered in a concurrent Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercise. More information on the flats to be offered under the November 2014 BTO exercise is available on the HDB InfoWEB.

they tell you if you move to a small flat in ulu location, you are doing the right thing 
 
but honesly, maybe they are targetting older folks who are not working anymore and needed an income, maybe these folks sell off their bukit merah flat, and settle for a 2 room flat in woodlands, see jb nice view, pay lesser, good deal lah

Hi Donut,
 
I'm a real estate saleperson and I must say that some of your pointers may not be totally truthful. Kindly allow me to explain.
 
Right from the beginning, prices between ECs and private condos aren't that far apart to begin with (not considering all the housing grants and different loan schemes). Lets say both are taking bank loans at maximum 80% and not eligible for any grants for comparison sake, I must say ECs are not to be recommended.
 
1stly, land is indeed cheaper as ECs are meant to be a lower source of private housing in the nearby future for upgraders and generally competition is not as tough as between the developers in the private market. Hence, prices will be priced cheaper for ECS and thats for sure since land cost is lower. 
 
2ndly, even though EC prices are pegged closely to private and thats bcos the initial selling prices aren't that far apart to begin with but are you aware of the restrictions of sale as compared to private condos? ECs are still heavily restricted by MOP rules which pretty much tie down all prices and buyers. Considering that the EC is building for 3 years plus 5 years MOP, it can only be sold to a Singapore Citizen or PR. You will need to wait for another 5 years (13 years from the day you signed on the dotted line) before it can be fully privatized and sold to generally anyone in the market including foreigners. Whereas private condos are regulated with Seller Stamp Duty nowadays which needs to tax the seller within the 1st 4 years of his ownership if he does decide to dispose his condo but the main difference is the clock starts tickling once you sign on the dotted line. So effectively with 3 years of construction, you only need to stay in and enjoy the brand new facilities for 1 year or rent it out for 1 year, you are free to sell to anyone who can afford the price you are asking with 0% tax and its usually the foreigners who are cash rich. So if you really want to compare Private condos with ECs, I'm afraid to say there's no ground for comparison. 
 
In a nut shell, ECs you will have to wait for abt 8 years before you can sell and its only to SCs and PRs whereas if you own a Private Condo you would have buy and sell twice to practically anyone who can afford right after you signed on the dotted line but need to take into consideration the Seller's Stamp Duty (tax free if its after 4 years of ownership). Do think of the opportunity cost that you incurred and lost along these 8 years of ownership. At the end of the day, it all boils down to affordability. If you can afford a private condo, who would wanna consider an EC??? 
 
Another thing to note, ECs behave very much like HDBs in the way that you can only own 1 at a time so if you are contented with just a roof over your head or perhaps upgrading to an one-to-one exchange at a later time then perhaps EC is the way to go. But if you have plans to have a multi-property portfolio, sooner or later you will still have to venture into private. Generally, private condos will command a higher appreciation in time to come at least for the 1st 10 years of ownership as compared to an EC which has not privatized for the 1st 13 years.
 
Its just my 2 cents worth, hope to share some stuffs that you guys may not be aware... CHEERS!

This is very true to some EC owner who don't know about this fact. 
Sorry if I have offended anyone here.

Sure or not? When you sign on the dotted line for a Private Condo, it's just the option to purchase and progressive payments. You get the "title deed" only after the TOP is issued, and when the full payment for the property is made (by cash or from bank loan). So MOP should still be counted from the date of TOP?
 
For people who are not speculators and can afford to live in the EC for 10 years after TOP, after 5th year MOP is met and the owner can go buy a second property. So he can still make use of all the grants given for the EC, to have a lower purchase price.
 
So ultimately, the key consideration is factoring in the new/resale prices of private condos nearby the EC, and based on the furnishing given by the developer, whether the price is discounted sufficiently as compared to private condo.

Do you know that you have to pay levies to govt for the 'grants' you took if you are moving on to get another from the govt ?
Unless you are moving on to buy a PC.

1) presently sole proprietor rent from land lord and the rent goes into expenses in the profit & loss book.
 
2) if sole proprietor buys a commercial property, how is the expenses (rent) calculated? By the monthly installment or  not regarded as rent at all?????

Yes you are right on that part. Do you know that the first batch owners of ECs are able to sell their units at 2x of purchase price, including levy on previous property? Similar private condos in the neighbourhood also command similar selling price as the EC, but their purchase price are 20 to 30% higher?
 
In the long run, when an EC is privatised, there is little difference between PC or EC in the same neighbourhood. The main catch is whether the price difference at the point of purchase is attractive enough for the buyer to be strapped in by the EC rules.

So ultimately, the key consideration is factoring in the new/resale prices of private condos nearby the EC, and based on the furnishing given by the developer, whether the price is discounted sufficiently as compared to private condo.

 
There's no MOP for Private Condos but its regulated under Seller's Stamp Duty which kicks off once you signed on the dotted line for the purchase. Sale of your property within 1st year of ownership will be 16% SSD, 2nd year of ownership will be 12%, 3rd year of ownership will be 8%, 4th year of ownership will be 4% and finally 5th year of ownership will be 0%!!! 
 
Title deed is given to you only when you have paid fully for the property so your statement about issued after TOP is wrong. 
 
Yes, owners can proceed to purchase a 2nd property after MOP is met for EC but do take note that there's Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty payable. For Singaporeans, it will be extra 7% on top of the usual 3% which adds up to a total of 10%. 
 
Do take note that good things seldom come cheap and cheap things seldom come good. With the heavily discounted price for EC, how well do you expect your fittings and furnishings to be? In terms of proximity to amenities and MRT, priority is seldom given to ECs and thats because our precious govt knows which plot of land is more valuable and more developers will be biding aggressively for it. 
 
So at the end of the day, it still boils down to affordability. CHEERS!

Yes you are right on that part. Do you know that the first batch owners of ECs are able to sell their units at 2x of purchase price, including levy on previous property? Similar private condos in the neighbourhood also command similar selling price as the EC, but their purchase price are 20 to 30% higher?
 
In the long run, when an EC is privatised, there is little difference between PC or EC in the same neighbourhood. The main catch is whether the price difference at the point of purchase is attractive enough for the buyer to be strapped in by the EC rules.

Personally, I have helped my clients gotten 2x of their purchase price for private condos as well. It all depends on your foresight and the condition of the property market at that time.
 
What I wanna emphasize highly is, ECs will only be able to show its full potential in capital appreciation only after 13yrs of ownership (counting from the date you signed on the dotted line) as compared to private condos being transacted at least thrice during these 13 years if you do not want to incurr any Seller's Stamp Duty. So do you think the 20-30% premium difference in pricing for private condos are worth it for accumulating 3x the profits as compared to earning that miserable amount of grant from the government? I will leave it for you to do the maths yourself.

the material use ... the location ... the overall design (subjective) is already 20% cheaper than private condo
hence, the 20% is not actual saving, right?

Thks bro for the reply.
 
But the question here is an asset like property can't be classify like a machinery where it can be written off. Still trying to figure out for not.
 
My understandings now is...
 
1. Buy and rent it to yourself but at a market value. The rental can be classify as expenses.
2. be sure to declare rental income in yearly assesment.
3. Interest paid to.bank can be also added as expenses.

Yes.. actually the price will move together with over property prices.
If it your only only home, it wont make much a different when you buy and sell the place.
 
HAving said that , the poor location is a always the biggest concern.. it's make living there inconvenient and selling it harder.

I'm sorry to inform you that you may not be eligible to apply. MOP must complete before you can sign your big name on the contract for next house so duration of construction is not taken into consideration. 
 
You are always welcome to call HDB hotline to clarify. CHEERS!

This is not like an IPO where "oversubscribed" shows real demand.
 
Applying for an EC has little cost except the time wasted so many people could just be trying their luck for a queue number. Couple that with the fact that Lake Life is has a lucky draw for each approved application (to win 10 1 carat diamonds), the actual demand would be less than that.

	NCPG Andy single-handedly boosts number of e-applications for executive condo
October 7, 2014
He is Singapore's Next Top Talent.

 
 


Talk about good advertising. Or rather, the importance of hiring a famous talent.
Lake Life – a 546-unit executive condominium development in the Jurong Lake District – has attracted more than 1,200 e-applicants after just three days.
And guess who is the poster boy for their ad? That’s right. It’s Andy – that boy who won big during World Cup.
Amidst a sluggish property market, Andy has single-handedly turned it around. Just check out the comments on Channels News Asia’s Facebook page:

Channel News Asia reported that units are expected to go at around S$880 to S$890 per square foot. If you want to live like Andy, better apply by Oct. 12, 2014. Bookings will begin on Nov. 8, 2014.

Lake Life EC was oversubscribed. 1200+ for 546 units!!!
 
Thanks to PM LHL for promoting the Jurong Lakeside area!!
 
http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/more-1200-applications-lake-life-ec
 
 
Interesting...
 
"Mr Ku also sounded a cautionary note to upgraders. Second-timers must consider the fact by the time they collect their keys and sell their current HDB, the HDB resale value may drop by 10 per cent in the next three years. In that case, your financial planning ... cannot cut it too thin, he said."

They anyhow use the term 'subscribe'
Afaik EC launches mostly like dat...
Last year i attended one, report says oversubscribed dunno how many times...
On selection day i come down see so many units got sticker already... like sold out like dat
 
After few months report come out only sold 60%

That was kinda what happened to me few years back at Tampines ARC. Went down showroom. Was actually looking at the Cabana units (cos of attached carpark!), but i think there were only 8 or 10 of those for the entire devt.
 
Agent tok until wah alot alot of peepur interested and want to buy must ballot or something. If want must give blank cheque etc etc, come down fast fast book on selection day, take Q ticket etc etc....  but becos selection day was a working day, i didn't want to take leave and waste time going down to Q. Turns out after selection day heard still got 1 or 2 cabanas unsold. But by then already not so interested liao.

Can buy must sell the first one. Regulatory as below
 
 
Each eligible Singaporean household can buy the following housing unit only twice: 
a flat from the HDB;
a resale flat with the CPF Housing Grant*;
a DBSS flat from developer;
an EC unit from developer.
*Only applicable for first-timer applicants

     Bear in mind your age must not exceed 55abv coz need to plough back $161k into your Cpf acct for retirement each ( Husb and wifey ) by then nothing much cash component to spent. not even buying a new car, unless a used car.

We sold our EC after the 5 year mark.  
 
Stayed in a rental apartment for a while.  
 
Then we bought a resale HDB.  
 
We are thankful that all things worked out, thankful to God.

Not easy to move back to HDB as you will not be eligible to buy one unless you sell the EC and live somewhere else for 1 year.

Yes that's the rule, same for private property. You have to sell it then wait for 30 mths before you can apply either a new hub or EC provided you meet the income criteria and only bought direct once.
If you have already bought direct twice then cannot whatsoever.

Ya I find this rule abit unfair actually cos I may want to downgrade when I've retired and 30 mths + the building period will be too long to rent/stay elsewhere. HDB will say then buy resale but since I only bought once direct why can't I have my 2nd bite?
 
Feel they should just allow every Singaporean to buy twice direct and not have this rule of go private have to wait for 30 mths, of course priority should be given to first timers.

I thought you can't buy resale also? By the way, if it is a BTO then it is not just 30 months. It will be 30months+balloting time+building time. Easily add another 4 years to your 30 months.

Then you will be subject to the vagaries of the market for the next 30 months. If prices fall, you are lucky. If prices rise, you are screwed.
 
The opposite happens to people who upgrade to EC from HDB. Because they usually wait till the EC is completed before they sell their HDB (otherwise they will be homeless), they are twice as affected by market movement since they have stakes in 2 homes. Price go up, they make a bundle. Price fall, they are screwed.

Resale can definitely buy just that you have to give up your private property. 
Yes it's 30mths plus the construction time for new flats and that's why I feel it's unfair cos where I'm going to stay meanwhile?? Just too long a period

That's why you need to buy resale without grant after owning private, wait for mop 5 years to pass, then apply for your 2nd EC. 
This way, at least you have a roof over your head while waiting for your EC to be completed.

But if you have a resale while waiting for your 2nd EC, you will have 2 properties at once and you will be subject to double the market movement....
 
Anyway, most people who can afford an EC would likely exceed the cap after 10 years (assuming the cap is the same or just increased to follow inflation).

I think many ppl have the wrong perception of EC.
 
EC, like any public housing, is for long term. U buy EC is to stay long. It's not meant for investment, not for flipping, not to buy and sell for higher profit. 
 
Those who want to make money, should go for private, where the potential is there.

Flipping is a rich man's game. If it turns sour, they can afford to hold on. For mere mortals, staying in EC for 10 years and selling as private generally will have some gains.
 
But then again, looking at the price that the developers have bid for EC sites, and with the quality of furnishings they give, the marginal difference is becoming smaller and smaller.

Precisely my point.
 
A typical person with a salary low enough to satisfy the cap for an EC will definitely be worried if they are subject to market movement for 2 houses.
 
Imagine a couple with 11k combined income holding 2 properties worth a combined 1.5 mil or more (900k for the EC and 600k for the resale). Shouldn't they be worried?

As long as can make money, does wrong perception matter?
 
I booked an EC after staying in a resale flat for 3 years. I opted for EC as it was about 200k more than PC.  So I reckon I could make 200k after my EC meets MOP.  I will sell it off and move back to HDB flat.
 
Fortunately, when I got my EC, my resale flat rose in value from about 560k to 700k in Dec 2013 when I had to let it go because of the 6 months' ruling on getting the EC. Now my resale flat in the same block is going for 80k less.

true story.... so a friend turned to me for advice on lakelife ec...
 
he's a civil servant, mid 40s, have young kids, combined income 12k, 5rm hdb fully paid, and a part-time entrepreneur (the kind who tries all kinds of things, many fail but hoping one might succeed)...
 
i asked if the unit he targetting smaller or bigger than his hdb? he said smaller as he couldn't meet debt requirement for the big ones (1.4mil!)
i asked if the ec further or closer to mrt? he said further
sports facilities? his hdb is walking distance to a swimming complex.. got 2 olympic pools plus lazy river and big slide...the ec has one shallow pool.
parking? his hdb is park directly downstairs. EC is one multistorey block some distance away
debt? Is he willing to go back into housing debt, be more hardworking so he doesn't lose his job, and sacrifice some entrepreneur time?
that one he couldn't answer
 
so in many ways its a downgrade
 
the clincher...
 
... a hopeful 500k profit in 10 years time for the kids' uni
 
 

not entirely true
 
1. many young couple salary below $12k whack EC because they think buy toyota sell lexus after MOP 5 years. this group of buyer is increasing rapidly
 
2. upgrader who sold their hdb ... they normally cash out the profit and they do not plonk $400k to the EC. they would love to cash out $100k-$150k and take on more loan for the EC
 
of course ... sensible and play safe type will plonk as much as possible into the EC and settle the loan in the shortest period
 
1st timer buy EC if nothing goes wrong in life for 5 years ... profitablity is high ... let's say buy at 30-35 with a 10 years early headstart compare to upgrader
 
upgrader age 40-45 buy EC ... i don't see a point especially the hdb is already fully paid up unless living in EC is a die die must have

So he's hoping to upgrade to EC. Then downgrade later to realise profit?
Seems like he only has one property which is his HDB.
 
If 500k profit for his EC, very likely the HDB he buying will be at record prices also.
Considering the estate around Lake Life (taman jurong area).

true story.... so a friend turned to me for advice on lakelife ec...
 
he's a civil servant, mid 40s, have young kids, combined income 12k, 5rm hdb fully paid, and a part-time entrepreneur (the kind who tries all kinds of things, many fail but hoping one might succeed)...
 
i asked if the unit he targetting smaller or bigger than his hdb? he said smaller as he couldn't meet debt requirement for the big ones (1.4mil!)
i asked if the ec further or closer to mrt? he said further
sports facilities? his hdb is walking distance to a swimming complex.. got 2 olympic pools plus lazy river and big slide...the ec has one shallow pool.
parking? his hdb is park directly downstairs. EC is one multistorey block some distance away
debt? Is he willing to go back into housing debt, be more hardworking so he doesn't lose his job, and sacrifice some entrepreneur time?
that one he couldn't answer
 
so in many ways its a downgrade

I have only one word for these people; many in fact in Singapore.
 
Over-greedy.
 
I will trade my 4-room for a older bigger HDB, but not a smaller EC or pte condom.
 
Better still, get those 20-30 year-old HDB built the traditional ways with ang zhng (red bricks). Rock solid!

and hope for 500K profit... might as well buy the real mature estates .. those areas appreciate much faster than ulu areas.. higher chance of making profit in 5 years time..

really, now thats a bargain.
 
with the red coloured bricks, the estate really look like a chalet. I actually like it.

 
Me too I really like Loyang Valley.
 
When I was young my girlfriend stayed there so weekends
 
when her parents were away I used to stay there too.
 
My colleague's uncle bought 2 units there hoping for enblock
 
to make a quick profit. He's the one scolding people that don't 
 
want to enblock and causing trouble.
 
The things people to do for money eh?
 
Quite a sad man really.

So he's hoping to upgrade to EC. Then downgrade later to realise profit?
Seems like he only has one property which is his HDB.
 
If 500k profit for his EC, very likely the HDB he buying will be at record prices also.
Considering the estate around Lake Life (taman jurong area).
 
 

 
yup told him its like going one big round to be where he is now

 
save 50K a year for 10 years will also get 500K for kids' uni

true. not just downturn... both parties have to continue working to mke sure there's enough cpf for payment.
can't really say no to the boss.
 
and then there's interest rate uncertainty.
 
lots of stress and prayers for 7 years... for a downgrade

the irony.... he is already in those old huge brick red flats  
i really hope he made a good choice. Haven't heard from him yet

I think its nowhere near the mrt station, yet people are comparing it to lakeville, which is a few steps from an mrt station.
and there is actually a nice new tall dbss there near jurong bowl with unobstructed clear view of chinese garden, at probably a third of the EC price.

Wait for main contractor to finish project = 3 years.
 
MOP = 5 yrs (if sell to another SG)
MOP = 10yrs (if want to sell to FT)
 
How to foretell the price in 8 or 13 yrs? Buy EC is to stay, not flip.

and hope also there are morons to buy my 5rm hdb at $1,000,000.

 
Yes, there will be people buying at $1,000,000.
But your 2room flat will cost $500,000.

I was damn lazy and went thru a broker when I got my loan the last time. He just showed me the few best quotes and I settled it from there.
 
Dunno how much he made but my quote was similar to what others got from the same bank so no loss to me.

Thinking of fixed

depends on how long you plan to service the loan.
 
if can pay off fast maybe within 10yrs? i think float more worth it leh. don't see sibor going to too much in the next couple of yrs.
 
if you plan take 25yr loan then fixed better.

You bought EC or condo?
 
I got mine through finahomeloan.sg. I am on 0.95%+ average (sibor+sor). Effective rate 1.271% currently.
 
Unfortunately, the way home loans are offered in SG, you can't take a long term view when deciding to go for fixed/ floating.
 
You can only decided if rates will rise fast and furious within 3 years (3 years is short term to me). At the end of 3 years, whether you are taking fixed or floating, you will have to refinance as the 4th year rate is carrot head rate.
 
Caveat: For floating rates, there is are 2 banks (ANZ and BOC, AFAIK) offering constant spread of 1%-1.05%%+SIBOR/SOR throughout the entire loan tenor meaning if you intend to take floating rates, you do not need to refinance unless you get another package with a compelling spread way lower than 1% or 1.05%.
 
Good luck and happy hunting!

HDB can also consider POSB. IIRC they had (still have?) a package that promises interest rates will be below the HDB rate for 8-10 years.

Not sure if sharing comm frm bank is still a practice.
 
When I looking for my loan , my housing agent offer to share his comm. frm the bank with us. A few grand.
 
ANZ has the best deal during my time.  spread was fixed at 0.75 + ave sor/sibir throughout tenure, 0.7 if you place $150k with them.I seriously doubt i see other better rates. Min annual income > 60k to qualify for the loan.

if u are 20/30... buy if you want take the risk..but if are in..40s. By the time u sell your ec already 50+..hopefully u have enuff cash for the next house.. else u may have problem securing a decent loan.. Flipping really dun think so.. as some Bro say.. you might as well go for better price condos where the time to sell is shorter.

Hmm a bit crowded when the 4 condos and Sea horizon (EC) are all up...
But i agree it's quite a chill place.
 
But probably the EC is the best. since enjoy the discount (if it's significant) and everyone else nearby is also 99LH.

Hence, the vehicular traffic impact from building one more condo block is higher than one hdb block.

I've always wondered if developers do indeed spend less per sq ft on developing EC compared to normal condos. 
 
Especially after that Tampines EC saga, by bidding for EC plot, there is an implied cap on setting prices (be it overall quantum or psf). Plus the fierce bidding for the plot which means purchase price is not cheap. 
 
Somewhere, something's gotta give and the path of least resistance is development cost. 
 
I look at the EC that are now reclassified as normal condo, the difference between them and an actual condo of the same age is quite evident.

All i know is most condos are built very fast now... Especially those by chinese developers I think on average 2 yrs to 2yr3mo.
Partly it's due to prefab technology. But i wonder.

My worse problems are the leaks
But their rectification team is good, managed to solve the leaks
I don't quite understand how drilling a pipe under the roof to drain off water from the roof can prevent leaks but that's what they did

Paris Ris prices have been rising, yet the resale prices of condos and HDB flats have not matched other locations. It might be hit with double whammy when the market cools further, when the whole stretch TOP and flippers start to let go.
 
If it's double whammy, private condo price might even match EC price. By then the EC buyers really bang b*lls...

EC buyers who signed the dotted line earlier, when they find that near TOP, the same money can be used to buy a private condo next door, and without the MOP and resale restrictions, they will bang balls more.
 
Of course, the private condo buyers who bought before TOP and find that later fire sales price drop, they will bang balls too.

With higher salary scale upward trend, Those on the marriage card hardly ill-afford to buy Ec unless has rich parent. footing half or most of the bill, dun tell me balloting of desired flats, Ec are always our-subscribed, isn't it ironic tt MND are pricing our youngster out of d market? 4-5 times the salary scale, totally ridiculous !
 
Gahmen should be helping those NSF guy who has completed NS some form of subsidy, finish 6 in-camp training, entitled to 10-15% subsidy, and so on, higher ranking opicer served longer deserve more subsidy etc
 
Tis way, We have guys will sign-up as regular servicemen, not shortages of any boys to men.

Coco Palm pales in this aspect when compared to SH.
Price  of course it's the main criteria.
 
Do note that coco lease tenure dates  back to 2008.
So actually lose 10 yrs liao when it TOP on 2018

No. 
 
Coco palm plot is originally agri plot.
 
To see the actual start date of Coco palm plot, check when CDL applied to SLA to change the land use to Resi use. I believe you can find the answer if you check CDL annual report in the last few years.

My worse problems are the leaks
But their rectification team is good, managed to solve the leaks
I don't quite understand how drilling a pipe under the roof to drain off water from the roof can prevent leaks but that's what they did

For discussion, plot 1 and 2 are Livia and NV Resi. 
 
2008 is correct. Seems CDL applied for plot 3 (Coco Palms) to be converted from agri to resi around 2007 and land tenure probably started in 2008 after approval. 
 
In 2009/10, it converted Plot 4 and Plot 5 (Palette and D'Nest) from agri to resi. 
 
I expected them to convert the land parcels in the order they were launched but seems Palette and DNest residents have the advantage of having a longer tenure at TOP despite Coco Palms being launched later.

YeahThere's a waterproof membrane that prevents rainwater from getting in via your walls and ceilings.  
These membranes do not last forever. 
 
They probably found where rainwater was coming in from and were able to use the pipe to divert the flow. If any path leading to your ceiling emerges, leak might resurface.

I was quite serious about DNest and another project. In the end, I found Pasir Ris to be too far from everywhere and the dual key unit was priced too high for my liking and I opted for the other project.

I agree with you that pr is a a bit way out considering its only 5 mins to airport.
 
But it's one of the least congested highway exit among other towns as there are quite a few of them along the way.

question....
 
A couples in their 40s decide to sell their present private house and get another one, my understanding is the money would be first channel back to cpf with interest.
 
So will they be able to fully use up their money in cpf account for the next purchase?
 
I am getting confused with the $155 500 minimum sum that is required in our cpf.

But at least when time comes.. no 30% restrictions in share purchase, no minimum requirements set aside before investment ruling.. I set the rule with my cash bec it's my own $$$

Other than boutique condos, there are some condos with decent land size and units without a tennis court too. Eg, Kovan Regency. But then again, The Terrace with more than 700 units should have include a tennis court.

I think most people will use both CPF and cash to pay for housing, especially if you if talk about private property and taking bank loan.

Was driving past TPE exit to punggol 2 saturdays ago, jam at the exit at 9pm on a Sat night. 5-10mins just to exit the express way. I dunno if there's roadworks or an accident. Although the waterway is nice by singapore standards, i wouldn't want to pay for a condo in what is essentially a 90% HDB township.

if one uses cpf for housing, then should max out the usage... For an example: for your first property that cost 1mil, down payment is 200k and u have 200k cpf and another 400k cash, u decide to use 100k cpf and 100k cash for the down payment, leave 100k cpf to earn interest and keep the rest of 300k cash to and use monthly pay to service installment... Sounds like a fantastic idea.. 
 
when u wanna purchase the 2nd property, say its 1mil also assume there is no ABSS and max loan is 60%.. So meaning got to pay 40% down payment.. Actually u have 100k cpf and 300k cash so just nice can pay the 40%. But here comes the cpf ruling that u have to set aside % of the minimum sum.. Which means that close to 70k cpf cannot be use.. So now have to depend on the 300k cash.
 
In the first place, if dump all cpf into the first property.. This will not happen

I wasn't that familiar with CPF rules when i applied for HDB then. Hence i used about 70k of our CPF only.
Reason was that the 2nd property would costs substantially more. But i'll have to repay CPF when i'm going for my 2nd one.
 
@hamburger, that's why i know it will hit 82.5k in 1-2 more years lol...  

 
If I am not wrong, I remembered previously I read from URA master plan that Punggol will be 60% HDB 40% private. I could be wrong though. (Put disclaimer) 

 
40%? Hmm ok...
Anyway if the EC/PC overlooks the nice part of punggol waterway then i guess it's nice. Been there twice.
If u have condos nearer the coastal part, that would have attractive like pasir ris as well.
Otherwise, i can't see myself putting up with the human traffic jam with the large numbers of pple projected in that one township.

There are a lot of ECs in Punggol. Too many for my liking. Plus private condos and some landed. But then I recalled what I read on URA so I guess the 60:40 still stand. Pasir Ris also seem to have a higher percentage of private condos for such a small estate. I think Punggol will turn into another Pasir Ris. 
 
Personally I am not interested in staying in Punggol. I just go there for leisure and nothing else.

That's why unlike the gurus here who pay for house using cash instead of cpf.. I rather use all my cpf and pay and let it be 一滴不剩... While cash sits in deposit and rot by inflation with 1.2% deposit rate... But at least when time comes.. no 30% restrictions in share purchase, no minimum requirements set aside before investment ruling.. I set the rule with my cash bec it's my own $$$
its not full facility condo?

 
Standard facilities minus the tennis court, facing the glorified waterway, which appeared to be 3 times the size from the brochure...lol
 
left right front back all block by HDB... wondering if it is a good purchase
 
I think the small plot of land, parting from bottom left is meant for the future polyclinic...
 
Any can share some good/bad things about this EC?

Polyclinic is listed as outside Oasis LRT, integrated development. This small plot is listed as health and medical care, likely to be a nursing home. 
 
No basement carpark. Surroundings will be HDB blocks as mentioned.

if one uses cpf for housing, then should max out the usage...
For an example: for your first property that cost 1mil, down payment is 200k and u have 200k cpf and another 400k cash, u decide to use 100k cpf and 100k cash for the down payment, leave 100k cpf to earn interest and keep the rest of 300k cash to and use monthly pay to service installment... Sounds like a fantastic idea..
 
when u wanna purchase the 2nd property, say its 1mil also assume there is no ABSS and max loan is 60%.. So meaning got to pay 40% down payment.. Actually u have 100k cpf and 300k cash so just nice can pay the 40%. But here comes the cpf ruling that u have to set aside % of the minimum sum.. Which means that close to 70k cpf cannot be use.. So now have to depend on the 300k cash.
 
In the first place, if dump all cpf into the first property.. This will not happen

 
good analysis bro...

The special account can count towards the cpf ruling of half the min sum if it is not invested. 
It cannot be used for property purchase anyway

Buy stack 03 08 ..or 23 etc i.e those higher floors overlooking the OSF school. It's a good development since its just to an international school from orchard. Empty plot means chance for appreciation in future.

agree. i was looking at the stack next to it overlooking the "forest". Think need to revisit the site again to better asses the view overlooking the school. Hope there is still the sea view to see..

This is the actual site of Punggol Polyclinic from Ministry of Health Facebook. The one in front of Terrace is listed as Health and Medical Care in the masterplan. If polyclinic is in front of the LRT, I don't think they will be another one in front of Terrace. If not the actual site for the polyclinic is here and they have decided to move to the LRT and have yet to provide any update to the Masterplan. Last update for Masterplan in fact was this year.

I don't dispute that there are people that play - I'm asking how many units actually utilise it well?
 
Most of the time, only a few people will be the ones using it in the entire development (like yourself) and the rest are just subsidising them.

83,85 will be more towards the private landed area. take a look at the masterplan to have a rough guide. I would say 85 is quite safe for unblocked views.

Yes..but must buy 8th floor n beyond to get past the school administration blk. The forested area will not be clear so soon now..probably not in the next 10yrs. There is a very big dispute run in with the residents when they clear the area for the school n condo when it was announced that the forest will be cleared for development. Government etc have to step in. Doubt they are so stupid to touch these areas again.

Yes confirmed the polyclinic is located there. There is going to be a commercial building most likely a shopping complex further up too. 
 
But furnishing n fixtures provided not as good as amore. N the density is a put off too..too many units means higher competition for utilities usage.
Yup, considering its at a 60 deg angle watching over a bit of roof top of the school.
Btw I visited the showroom yesterday.. Stack 08 left little units already . The more expensive Stack 03 still have more to choose from.
 
If u want to have a clearer idea of what views u will be getting..go up to the hdb blk nearby. U will see that stack 03 is mostly unblocked.
 
The only complain I have with this development is that the balcony is at the masterbed room instead of living room.
 
Stack 99 has 2 bedders facing the sea view but it's sold out very early on...

Need go back check stack 3 position again to better assess.
 
Btw, I actually prefer living room w/o balcony. More living spaace to move around.

I think there's too many EC round the Punggol area - and come time to sell, there's going to be some very disappointed people that won't be getting the sorts of prices they hoped. 
We almost bought - but at the end of the day didn't quite make sense for self stay....sell our 5 room for $500k, buy an EC of similar size for $1million.....$500k of debt to have a pool downstairs and possible sell in 10 years time?  I don't think that's a prudent decision...

when EC TOP 2 years down the road, your 5 room will probably fetch 400k (as market watchers predict), and debt is 600k.
 
New 600k debt for a smaller unit than your hdb i bet.
 
that's what bugs me about these ECs for supposedly upgraders with limited income. Ideally, EC prices should be affordable for upgraders... meaning assuming they have been maintaining their lifestyle, they just need to sell their existing HDB, clean out their CPF, and if a loan is needed, no more than 100k. That's my personal benchmark for affordable.
 
People with limited income are just rolling into debt with the notion that it's "good debt"... half a mil.... without batting an eyelid..... and "surely can sell high".
 
Debt is a burden, good or bad.

Base on the trend, SK punggol HDB resale value is likely to drop as many who bought ec in that area lives in that area itself. Too many ec in punggol, sk ara liao. Remembered some bro in this forum bought his ec base on his HDB selling price back then.think now when the ec starts top, more people selling their HDB, the value is gonna to drop. This is the situation that one may want to avoid.

Ya, you are right.  This is what I am thinking too.  I always wanted to upgrade to EC but i see the area getting smaller and smaller, cannot imagine myself paying more for smaller area.  Moreover, living room is very small but the balcony is so BIG!
 
I am afraid that I buy the EC at high price but when I collect key, I sell my HDB at low price when the propery price drop. Like tat I lugi alot.
 
So what I do now is to save as much as I can.  When the property prices drop, i will buy and one to one exchange if possible.  If no drop then I stick to my HDB.  :)

to mitigate the NIMBY mentality for Chinese temples
 
they should put power generators in temples so that whenever offerings are burnt,
 
the power generated could be channelled to neighbouring blocks FOC to subsidize the residents utilities bills.

In my experience normally roasted meat / steak and fries type that has a fairly decent and relaxed bar (beer on tap) as part of the attraction

Future residents of Fernvale Lea BTO in Sengkang West surprised by columbarium plan

A new columbarium expected to come up in Sengkang West in 2016 to provide a resting place for the dead has already stirred up unease among the living.
 
Australian funeral services company Life Corporation won a tender called by the Housing Board in July to develop a Chinese temple integrated with a columbarium at a land parcel in Fernvale Link.
 
The proposed site sits squarely next to an upcoming Build-To- Order residential area, Fernvale Lea, which will have residents moving in early next year.
 
Life Corp, the parent company of Singapore Funeral Services, said the space will be used to run funeral services, columbarium space and associated services.
 
Life Corp CEO Simon Hoo said details of the project were still being finalised. "We are still working with the architect on the design for the look and feel of it. We expect it to be completed in 2016," he told The Straits Times earlier this month.
 
News of the integrated columbarium took some future residents by surprise. They said they were unaware that the site would include such a facility. They also claimed that the development booklet of the area they were issued with showed the site was reserved for a Chinese temple.
 
"If the plan was to have a columbarium there, then it should be written properly in the booklet," said human resources executive Josephine Soh, 28, who is moving into Fernvale Lea next year. "I know I should respect the dead, but I don't wish to live near a columbarium knowing that the dead are resting there," she said.
 
Others wondered how resale prices of their flats might be affected. Property executive Rite Jailani, 33, said: "The location is already not that good. It's not near the LRT or coffee shops. Now I'm scared the value of the flat will drop if people know it's near a columbarium."
 
In response to queries by The Straits Times, the HDB and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) said the town map and site plan issued included notes which indicated that "places of worship may include columbarium as an ancillary use".
 
They added that the space occupied by the columbarium should be out of sight from surrounding buildings and not exceed 20 per cent of the total gross floor area of the building.
 
There are a few columbariums located near residential districts, such as Yishun Columbarium in Yishun Ring Road.
 
But some still feel that such facilities should not be near where people live. IT project manager Loh Hon Chun, 33, who has lived in Sengkang West for five years, said: "My understanding of a columbarium is that it's somewhere in a forested area, like Mount Vernon, not near somewhere with high resident density."

leaving it in the fine prints makes hdb looks sneaky
maybe can consider builing rental blocks next to columbarium
since rental units are so much in demand

Other than the smoke when pple burn offerings. I don't really think a columbarium is offensive...
Fernvale Lea is the one reported in the news.

 
Ya, I think is fine too.  There's also a temple cum columbarium near my HDB area.  But this temple not very big. 
 
I see the mock up picture of the new temple cum columbarium in Fernvale is quite big, around 6 or 7 stories high.  As time goes by, they will eventually get used to it.

2500 units not required units is quite a lot. These are subsidised stuff. Every unit should be lived in - in theory.
 
 
http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/singapore/nearly-2-500-vacant-ec/1878490.html
 
SINGAPORE: There are 2,446 vacant executive condominium (EC) units in the market, according to first-quarter figures from the Urban and Redevelopment Authority (URA).
 
These are completed units which have not been sold, or units which are purchased but left unoccupied. This could be due to EC buyers needing more time to move in. However, analysts also said that there are buyers who do not intend to live in the units.
 
ECs typically attract HDB homeowners who want to upgrade their homes. They make up about 50 per cent of those who buy ECs. Under HDB rules, these upgraders have six months to sell their existing flats, after collecting the keys to their new units.
 
But analysts said that with declining HDB resale prices, more EC buyers are taking longer to sell their flats, and this is pushing up the vacancy rates.

KNN ... buy EC and leave empty
these so called upgraders investors use T2 money to flip property ... lol
 

Said Mr Ku Swee Yong, CEO of Century 21 Singapore: "We also sense that there are many who are investors in ECs, they are not buying the ECs because they want to live in it. They are buying the ECs for probably a financial investment motive and having taken the keys. They are probably still staying with their parents or they are staying elsewhere and they are not moving in."

its possible.
 
one reason is u put up for sale, but no buyer interested
second reason is u ask for too high price. no buyer
 
Nowadays, market is quite quiet.  The worse is HDB already building so many new BTOs flats. Buyers can buy new BTOs, rather than a resale HDB.
 
I forsee many appeal cases at HDB, to extend the 6 month policy for these ppl.

KNN ... buy EC and leave empty ... i want to buy and live EC also cannot ...
use T2 money to flip property ... lol
 
 
 

 
In theory, yes, you can leave it empty, but you cannot rent out

Another thing to note is how these units were counted.
 
Did they also count:
 
1. Units that were just completed and handed over. Owners could be doing their own reno (although not much to be done for an EC). It could be that they counted at a time when some major projects were just completed and owners have not had time to move in.
2. Units completed but keys not yet handed over? Some developers damn CB.... take damn long to distribute the keys.
 
A better gauge would be the number of units empty 3-6 months after completion.

KNN ... buy EC and leave empty

I think this guy is talking rubbish.
 
You can't sell an EC without owning (and pretending to stay in it for 5 years). You mean those people have the intention to leave it empty for the whole 5 years? Wouldn't it be more prudent to move their parents into the EC while they rent out their current place for 5 years? The rental will be quite substantial.
 
Anyway, the second part about having a financial investment motive, I think that applies to all buyers (even buyers of HDBs and GCBs).

 
In theory, yes, you can leave it empty, but you cannot rent out

 
Yes, but your MOP is counted only if you occupy the flat. (of course, HDB might not be able to know when you occupy or not occupy it).
 

The MOP is calculated from the date you collect the keys to the flat. It excludes any period that the flat is not occupied by the flat owners, such as when the whole flat is rented out or when there is any infringement of the flat lease.

Some is still staying with papa and mama in big house and has never intend to stay in the EC in the first place. Bought because they want to make money out of it.
 
I would say that this is possible but quite unlikely because the EC discount isn't that much in the first place. Instead of leaving it empty for 5 years, I think they'd have better investment returns in a similar (but more expensive condo) with which they can rent out for the 5 years.
 
I think the rental would more than make up for the discount in the end.

Think the problem ec not selling well is because the salary cap is too low vs the high selling price.
 
12k income is only 6k per spouse. A fresh grad couple will reach that in 5yrs or so?
 
Most of the couples I know work for 5-10yrs already far exceed the 12k mark. Think they should revise the ceiling to 15k for ec

that's the problem with garment.
 
On one side, they still think our money is still v big (like policeman wear shorts era). 12k can buy many many things, can live like a sultan.
 
On the other side, prices of goods are increasing like crazy (inflation). Many of us (the new poor generation) are surviving hand to mouth.
 
The garment is in self denial mode.......

No, they should not make the revision.
 
The developers bid on the land price based on their understanding of the buyer profile and affordability (12k monthly max). If you raise it to 15k, all that will do is allow the developers to bid higher for the land - benefit will most likely go back to the land owner.
 
The reason why there are unsold units is not because the salary cap is too low but because the developers made wrong calculations (probably expecting HDB prices to be stable instead of falling). Developers should take the loss and lower prices instead of expecting the government to change the policy to suit them.

Agreed...
If increase to 15k, then the only winner are still the developers who will price even higher for the land prices knowing that they have a bigger market to catch now....
 
IMHO, just have 2 categories: Public HDB and Private...
scrapped away the EC ... those can afford just go apply private...
EC just like dbss ... neither here nor there...

Many forget that EC is meant for the sandwiched class. If the household can earn more than $12k, then probably can afford to buy condo lah. 
And I do think the unsold units are not including those unoccupied units. No agency is so free to despatch people every month to count the sold units that are not occupied yet.

$10k > $12k > $15k (if)
 
the higher the ceiling does not mean EC will be cheaper nor more people can buy because developer price EC insanely. no matter what, developer will want to maximise profit like building unit with enormous big balcony and giant patio, roof terrace and void
 
raising ceiling give more opportunity for developer to sell higher and anyhow shout sibei affordable

But the developers knew the criteria for buyers before they bidded for the land.
 
Can't be a situation of "heads I win, tails I also do not lose" for developers.
 
They can always drop prices to move units.

These are completed units which have not been sold, or units which are purchased but left unoccupied.

 
The figures are from URA and not property analyst as some infer.
But I wonder how URA will know those "purchased but left unoccupied" cases.
Never open a PUB account could be one indicator.

I think they are making out numbers to catch attention. 
Just show the figure of unsold is good enough. 
Why pull in those haven't collect key? Completed but waiting for TOP? waiting for key collection?  
Even buyers defer key collection doesn't mean they given up on their unit!
 
Those new launches EC with 800 sqft at 900psf is very ex.
It defy the initial intention of having a EC concept. 
Now, more stupid idea implemented only made this EC looks like a profiting tools to HDB.
Doesn't helps those who can't afford a PC to own one.
 
Just like the recent DBSS case, DBSS was also create for a reason.
Along the way, it diverted its course n turn the buyers dreams into a nightmare.
 
Bottom line is, what had been created initially must have a very good control or else its just doesn't work out to benefit all Sg.

since we are on upgrade, i think i can post it here.. a buddy gives me an idea recently on how to cash out some money and upgrade, just want to get your thought on this idea.. pros and cons... 
 
i have a fully paid-up 4-rm flat, should be able to fetch around $430-$450 (used to be smelly smelly $500K+ 1.5 yr ago)... he suggested me to upgrade to a new 5-rm BTO (going as 2nd timer)
 
if sell 4-rm at $430, $197K+$30K(interest)+$81.5K (half of profit) will go back into cpf, -40K(levy to gov for nation building). balance left $81.5K cash roll out from this deal.
 
(total proceed of 308.5K goes back into cpf OA account)
 
Then, buy a new BTO 5-rm flat at $400k. take $20K from the cash profited as DP, then the rest from CPF can clear, no loan necessary).
 
now, i have a new 5-rm BTO and 61.5K cash on hand for new car DP.. hehe...
the down side is my OA amount drop by 71.5K (use to fully pay up the new flat) and have to start accumulating again....
 
those who has done this before, what is the pros and cons, can share?..

since we are on upgrade, i think i can post it here.. a buddy gives me an idea recently on how to cash out some money and upgrade, just want to get your thought on this idea.. pros and cons... 
 
i have a fully paid-up 4-rm flat, should be able to fetch around $430-$450 (used to be smelly smelly $500K+ 1.5 yr ago)... he suggested me to upgrade to a new 5-rm BTO (going as 2nd timer)
 
if sell 4-rm at $430, $197K+$30K(interest)+$81.5K (half of profit) will go back into cpf, -40K(levy to gov for nation building). balance left $81.5K cash roll out from this deal.
 
(total proceed of 308.5K goes back into cpf OA account)
 
Then, buy a new BTO 5-rm flat at $400k. take $20K from the cash profited as DP, then the rest from CPF can clear, no loan necessary).
 
now, i have a new 5-rm BTO and 61.5K cash on hand for new car DP.. hehe...
the down side is my OA amount drop by 71.5K (use to fully pay up the new flat) and have to start accumulating again....
 
those who has done this before, what is the pros and cons, can share?.. 
 
 
 

 
 
i bet this new bto location is less convenience compare to your current place right?  that is the trade off.

why must 81.5k half of profit to go back to cpf?
 
isn't it only loan amount + accrued interest needed?
 
have you factored in agent commissions, stamp duties and legal fees(need cash?) and reno etc when determining your cash balance

Don't put any cash into your new home, use them to pay more down payment on your new car better.

You havn't count renovation leh? Lets say 40k for reno, you are left wil 21.5k, not enough DP for a new car. LOL
BTW the 81.5k (Half of Profit) must go back CPF? Is there a ruling for this?

hehehe... still upgrade mah... from 93sqm to 110sqm not too shabby hor.... 
Don't think it's worth the hassle if his intention is to make $ out of his current unit, unless the cash back is more than 150k.
 
actually, after checking, the cash is more than 160K , no need to put 50% profit into cpf unless i take up 2nd time HDB loan, something like that... the idea is not so much about cash out but more like utilize the 2nd timer to upgrade from 4-rm to 5rm for "free".....

In 4 years' time, we don't know what is the selling price of his current 4 room flat.
 
in 4yrs time, even drop 100K also no sweat lar... that's the gamble everyone is taking, just like those who bought dbss, they lost big time lor....... the key is at what price i wanna commit now.. can buy a 350K 5-rm or 400K 5-rm or even a 450K 5-rm bto...

Sell 4 Room
Cash + 81.5k
CPF + 308.5K
Tax - 40K
Property - 100sqm - better location
 
Buy 5 Room
CPF - 400K
Property + 110 sqm + lousier location
 
End
Cash + 81.5K
CPF - 91.5
Tax - 40K
Property +10 Sqm - location
 
Benefit
10sqm + cash 81.5K
 
Cost
CPF - 91.5
Tax - 40K
good Location
 
Value of this 10sqm = 400k / 110sqm * 10sqm = 36k
 
10sqm + cash 81.5K = 91.5K + 40k + good location
36k +cash 81.5k = 131.5K + good location
cash 81.5k = 95.5k + good location
 
bottom line, to get the 81.5k, you pay 95.5k + good location
that dont look like a good trade off
but heck! driving that new swanky car down the neighbourhood is priceless!!!

i stand corrected then.
I've not seen any new point blocks for a long while. 2 of my friends used to stay in point blocks. One torn down for SERS, one still present. Both in 1980s type.
 
The BTOs i applied for definitely don't have any point block designs. I've not seen any in where i work or live either.

Actually more lifts, ppl don't wait for oncoming ones...or purposely take another lift instead of sharing.....waste energy resources

The least is 1 lift to 2 units, these are the upgraded ones, last time lift only on 5, 7, 9, 12 that kind
 
Also seen some 5 units per level, quite nice and quiet 
 
This is also a point of consideration during house hunting

If you are already staying in punggol,  then how far can the new place be?  Unless you are staying in matured estate then the trade off is bigger.

Dude -

I see the things that my kids get to participate in now because of the size of the school and am very de jealous - 
things like math contests, national day parade, CCA, learn Malay, have writing contests...
Lots of things that are very good and I turn very green that stuff like this not possible when I was a kid - how to do when you only have 20+ students from age 5 through 12? 
 
 
Mind you - I do remember for another primary school I attended - our graduating year we wrote and performed our own play for the year end concert - that was fun :-)

100% true ...
different folks, different strokes - 
It was a great childhood - 
by the same token - I sometimes wonder what might have been if I had the same chances my kids have...
 
Which is better? I dunno..
But when people criticise the system here, while I agree too much stress I also have to give thumbs up to the opportunities
 
No one system is perfect - you have to take good with bad and decide which is most important to you

since we are on upgrade, i think i can post it here.. a buddy gives me an idea recently on how to cash out some money and upgrade, just want to get your thought on this idea.. pros and cons... 
 
i have a fully paid-up 4-rm flat, should be able to fetch around $430-$450 (used to be smelly smelly $500K+ 1.5 yr ago)... he suggested me to upgrade to a new 5-rm BTO (going as 2nd timer)
 
if sell 4-rm at $430, $197K+$30K(interest)+$81.5K (half of profit) will go back into cpf, -40K(levy to gov for nation building). balance left $81.5K cash roll out from this deal.
 
(total proceed of 308.5K goes back into cpf OA account)
 
Then, buy a new BTO 5-rm flat at $400k. take $20K from the cash profited as DP, then the rest from CPF can clear, no loan necessary).
 
now, i have a new 5-rm BTO and 61.5K cash on hand for new car DP.. hehe...
the down side is my OA amount drop by 71.5K (use to fully pay up the new flat) and have to start accumulating again....
 
those who has done this before, what is the pros and cons, can share?.. 
 
 
 

I think it's better for you to keep your fully paid sundial better. I don't really see any real tangible benefit of upgrading. As long as you are comfortable with your current house and location, just stick with it.

Sounds great. You will end up with a newer and bigger flat that's fully paid. Though your are poorer by 71.5k in CPF, you will own half a brand new car - just like taking out your CPF money to fund your new car.

Same for me, toying with the idea to upgrade to a 18 yrs old HDB EA flat from 5-rooms flat but will need to take another 20yrs 300k loan but with $140k cash return and OA will be fully depleted. After renovation, probably the cash return reduce to $80k.

I think not worth it if the size of EA is not significantly bigger than your 5 room
 
Dont forget that all benefits which ties to housing size will be reduced too

Your upgrade is not the same as Blackyu.  He upgraded to a bigger flat with no debts and half a brand new car.

I downgraded from a fully paid EA to a 2 bedder EC with loan of 450k and cash of 700k from sale of EA.

No no no ... have to be frugal, what one needs and what one wants is totally different. Trying very hard to save as much as we can, money don't grow on trees and may get retrenched anytime. Hoping to retire peacefully.

'Unpopular' Sengkang, Punggol flats' values soar
 
 
Build-To-Order (BTO) flats in Sengkang and Punggol may have been unpopular when they were first launched, with complaints over the location and lack of amenities.
 
 
But home buyers who signed up for the flats 10 years ago are now having the last laugh, with the value of their homes nearly tripling.
 
The Straits Times looked at data provided by SRX Property on flats launched in and after 2002, when the BTO system began.
 
Of these, Sengkang four-roomers with leases starting in 2009 saw the most number of transactions. They had cost up to $205,000 when first launched around 2005.
 
Their average resale price over the past three years was $566,880, about 2.8 times the highest price that home owners would have paid to HDB.
 
Over the past year, even though the market has cooled, Sengkang four-roomers still regularly fetch above $500,000 on the resale market. Even the lowest recorded sale was $410,000, twice the highest original launch price.
 
The second-most common transactions were those of Punggol four-roomers with leases beginning in 2007.
 
Their average resale price was $484,577 overall, though this has dipped to $449,208 since last year.
 
But this is still more than 2.5 times the highest launch price in 2003, when HDB offered these for $138,000 to $178,000.
 
Analysts noted that the overall market over the past 10 years has also improved, with the resale price index rising by about 90 per cent.
 
But BTO units have rightly beat the market, said R'ST Research director Ong Kah Seng, who added: "These are subsidised flats, so it is a given that the prices will appreciate significantly between occupation and when they can be resold."
 
Another factor is that those once underdeveloped towns have blossomed, he added.
 
Marketing manager Frieda Chan and her husband sold their four-room Sengkang flat, which they had bought for $193,000, for more than $500,000 last month.
 
"We didn't expect to sell it so quickly," said Ms Chan, 34, who found a buyer within a week.
 
The couple, who have two daughters, bought a jumbo resale flat in Ang Mo Kio. They paid about $800,000 for it, and Ms Chan's in-laws will be moving in with them.
 
"I think it's worth it," she said. "We wanted a bigger space and it will be closer to my older daughter's primary school and our workplaces."

unless one is forced by liquidation of asset, moving to a smaller house has little significance to me.

Yup, it is really spacious even if you exclude the aircon ledge, should be around 139sqm. See a similar EA 146sqm floor plan below

Couple reject lucrative offers for flat
Yeo Sam JoThe Straits TimesWednesday, Jul 08, 2015
 
 

Mr Brian Chee, 41, his wife Catherine Low, 38, their daughter Heidi, five, and son Reygan, eight, live in a top-floor four-room flat in Punggol East. They are happy there and have no intention to sell despite attractive resale prices. Photo 
 
 
 
Step into Mr Brian Chee and Ms Catherine Low's four-room flat in Punggol, and one is greeted by a steady breeze and stunning views of Serangoon Reservoir, Pulau Ubin and even Malaysia.
 
Little wonder then that the couple have no intention of selling their 18th-floor flat, even though property agents have come to them with lucrative offers.
 
Last year, an agent promised them $600,000 for their unit - more than three times the $170,000 they paid for the flat.
 
But they were quick to refuse.
 
"We were not tempted at all," said Mr Chee, a 41-year-old stay-at-home father. "We like the greenery and environment, and it's very quiet and peaceful here."
 
The couple moved into their top-floor unit in Block 167A, Punggol East in 2007. They applied for the Build-To-Order flat in 2003.

Very simply.
To really participate in the upswing of property prices, you need to have more than one property.
So what if they sell it? They wont be able to realise the gains unles they pack up and leave the country!

pay $170K in 2007, live for 8 years for FREE and make $430K ... why don't want to sell?
can the TS of the thread of govt pay money to us to buy hdb answer this?
i seriously cannot understand this logic leh ... LOL
 

Wont earn much
 
If they go buy resale in mature estate, 4 room will costs around 430k for 30+ years flat, condition should be quite bad, throw in another 50K reno plus all the stamp duty, resale levy etc
 
Not much left n for the old flats, its not worth it
 
The only way they can earn is to apply for second bto, but have to wait for a few years

Nowadays with land prices high, and yet housing prices also high, developers want to maximise their profits... and then poor workmanship comes in ...
The only casualty is the home-owners whom have paid so much and yet still have to endure the many defects that come with the new house....
Whom can we turn to?
Most of the ppl in the garmen are staying in landed and not taking public transport... how do they know our woes?

Buy completed or resale, what you see is what you get (at least for time being).  Buy new (view from catalog)
 sure got some risks.

My thoughts is because with 12K and the prices is a stretch , if anything happen, the house is at risk.
 
Knowing the typical profile, the buyer would want to buy at the most they can afford, not at the rate of risk they can stomach. The TDSR does help, but this only means the unit will be smaller.
 
But if you move it higher, the developer may also want to prop up the profit , no ? after all the cost of the bidded land is high.
 
Question, question, question

I wonder why govt want to sell and plan to launch so many EC projects. Strap for cash?
 
It's obvious it's not going to be good investment given the projects are all built in the same area such as Sengkeng, Punggol and Woodlands. The property market in the said areas will be so saturated with ECs it will only make loses for the property owners. And the thing is who will want to buy a used ECs when govt going to launch new EC projects within the same area?

I believe if you exceed less than 1K and IF its a EC you are applying, they normally will be approved.
 
If its for a HDB , not sure if the rules are more rigid.
I have heard of people who change job and take 2 months in between breaks just to apply for a HDB.

There will be a drought of ECs in 2018 and 2019 and it's likely that Rivercove EC is the only 1 or 2 EC to be launched in 2018
 
Current Status of all ECs:
Parc Life 80% sold
Signature at Yishun 76% sold
Northwave 76% sold
iNz 89% sold
Criterion 90% sold
 
Brownstone 7 units left.
 
Most ECs should be sold out by June next year.

I wonder how could a normal 1st timer folk that do not exceed the ceiling is able to afford a 1 mil home. Are gov expecting many have more than 500k cash for down payment or parent help to buy for them?

if couple married at 30 each has been working for 5 years and combine income of $10K should be able to afford. You go to see those EC plenty of residents belong to this demography.

no need 500k cash ah. Only 20% downpayment.. so for 800k-1m property, only need 200K cash +CPF. work 5 years shud have 100K in OA CPF combined so need 100k cash. Not little but feasible for those who wants to.

As an EC purchaser, I can only say it is possible. But yes, 2nd timer will of course have more $ la.
 
btw, why need 500k downpayment? isn't it 20%?

If we dont consider current salary due to inflation, 10 years ago, 30 yrs salary is ~3k a mth. Minus aways cpf, expense, money for parent allowance. Do the math and count how much saving left? Not to mention if one own a car. 
Note, this does not take into consideration for some that doesnt have increment for past few years if company not doing well

Just like when casino first started. Everyone speculate the prices near casino will shoot up.

When its first buildings are ready in five years, Punggol North could become something of a mini Silicon Valley in Singapore - a centre for digital and cyber-security industries that generates up to 28,000 digital economy jobs.
The masterplan for the 50ha Punggol Digital District was launched yesterday by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean at Waterway Point mall, together with an exhibition on what the district would look like.
Speaking at the event, Mr Teo said the plan is to make Punggol "a hub for key growth sectors of the digital economy", and that could even involve moving government agencies, such as the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore - currently in Maxwell Road - to the district.

To be fair, if people know how to invest and can earn triple of the mortgage rate outside, by all means take loan. I think majority of heartland Singaporeans don't really how to grow their money in investments and with too much cash in the bank, they will just itch to buy car or spend money on other liabilities, so paying their house in full is already considered an "investment" to these people.

abit difficult for 99 yr lease to have 100 or 99 yrs loan but nowadays, many talk about cashflow rather than the full price (including interest). nothing wrong in that, just a different way of living life.

can always make it 60 year lease and then sell at a decent price.
 
But as the size is going to be reduced / moderated, I just fear its going to be 60 years lease AND still make it even smaller to boost the profit margin.
