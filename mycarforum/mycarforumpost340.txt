Topic: ROOT CAUSE of "sky-high" HDB flat prices 
 
Note for readers:
1 Reproduced below is the full text of my letter to TODAY Voices section --- which was rejected(read: censored) for publication for the obvious reason that I had exposed "The HDB Flat Pricing Scam" (which not many S'poreans are aware of).
 
2 Key Issue --- The HDB (under $2m Minister Mah Bow Tan) had used the clever term "market subsidy" to confuse buyers of HDB new flats into thinking their flats are "heavily subsidized" (Mah's own words) by the PAP Govt.
In fact, there is no "cash subsidy" at all and the HDB is actually raking in a cleverly-disguised profit !
 
3 For greater public awareness, please help to forward to as many people as possible and ask them to do likewise (for "the multiplier effect").
More informed voters can then vote appropriately at the next 2011 General Elections to send a strong message to the PAP Govt to provide truly-affordable housing for the people.
 
 
 
Original Text of my email letter to TODAY newspaper:
 
In his letter "Resale flats out of reach" (TODAY Jan 17), Mr Anthony Tan highlighted the problems faced by many first-time HDB flat-buyers. Allow me to trace the root cause behind their dilemma.
 
As a 60-year old educated Senior Citizen, I surf the Internet regularly to gauge the true concerns of young Singaporeans, who are mostly hesitant to speak up openly.
 
I empathise with their growing despair on home ownership. Many are resigned that private flats are now way beyond their reach. All they simply want is a basic no-frills inexpensive flat --- with enough money left to decorate it to their own personal taste into a cosy home!
 
However, even with HDB flats, they are caught between the devil and the deep blue sea --- either wait 4 years for "expensive" new flats or else pay "sky-high" prices for resale flats. They are rightly concerned that a $1 million HDB resale flat may not be that far-fetched.
 
One worry is that, despite such high prices, few buyers will feel the pinch immediately because up to 90% of the cost can be financed by long-term home loans stretching up to 30 years.
 
So many seldom give a second thought that if they borrow, say, $300,000 under a 30-year loan, they could ultimately cough up nearly $600,000 in total capital and interest repayments.
 
Another worry: If a young couple have to sink so much of their hard-earned income and CPF savings into their brick-and-cement flat, how much monies will there be left to raise a family and sent their children to university --- not to mention providing for their own healthcare and retirement needs in their golden years?
 
 
In the 1970s, the starting graduate salary was $1000 per month. Then, in the HDB Marine Parade Estate, prices of new 5-rm, 4-rm and 3-rm flats were $35,000, $20,000 and $17,000 respectively. In 1990, average price of new 5-rm flats was $70,000. Such prices then reflected a "cost-based pricing approach".
 
Now, starting graduate salary is 3 times higher at $3,000 per month but prices of similar HDB new flats have gone up by 10 times to 30 times. The massive price hikes were largely the result of the HDB switching over to a "market-based pricing approach".
 
 
Since 2002, many have queried the HDB in newspaper forums on how its new flats are actually priced. Last December, the HDB finally confirmed that "the prices of new HDB flats are based on the market prices of resale HDB flats, and not their costs of construction."
 
This is a simple-to-understand example using data from 2000, when 5-rm new flats were priced upwards of $200,000.
 
However, from actual tendered contracts of HDB Building Contractors, the Construction Cost per flat was about $50,000. Adding on an estimated $70,000 for Land Cost & Other Related Costs, the Total Breakeven Cost per flat was about $120,000 --- which HDB should set as the selling price, since it is supposed to be a not-for-profit, low-cost public housing developer.
 
But, under the market-based pricing approach, HDB will first look at the then prevailing market price of, say $260,000 of a 5-rm resale flat. It will then pick a lower figure of, say $200,000 as the selling price for the 5-rm new flat --- never mind if its actual Total Breakeven Cost was only $120,000.
 
The HDB can then say the new flat buyer is getting a "market subsidy" of $60,000 arising from the difference between the resale flat price and new flat price. Notice, under such an approach, there is absolutely no "cash subsidy" granted at all to the new flat buyer. Instead, the HDB is actually collecting a profit of $80,000 per flat (representing a 67% profit margin). In contrast, private developers normally earn around 20% profit margin for assuming business risks.
 
Most importantly, this HDB market-based pricing approach had resulted in new flat prices and resale flat prices chasing each other in an upward spiral ---- that is financially disadvantageous to buyers of both new and resale flats.
 
Should HDB deem the above example as simplistic or misleading, the onus lies with it to rebut and substantiate with its own detailed data.
 
HDB should also provide its public response to this remaining burning question --- Why is the HDB not really helping first-time buyers of new flats by passing on to them the substantial cost-savings from economies-of-scale in massive HDB developments through pricing new flats on a "cost-based break-even" approach?
 
 
We have also since moved from small "pigeon-holes" to tiny "bee-hives" --- extremely costly beehives, to be precise! HDB new flats are now built smaller, closer and at higher price.
 
The HDB itself had stopped building the larger 1200 sq ft 5-room and 1400 sq ft Executive flats. Current prices of 1000 sq ft 4-rm HDB new flats range from $200,000 (in Senkang) to $400,000 (in Telok Blangah) and up to the whopping $590,000 (in Boon Keng, under Design, Build and Sell Scheme by private developer).
 
 
Our politicians constantly exhort Singaporeans to treat Singapore as "home" literally and figuratively. To help solve our Procreation Problem, young couples are also reminded not to delay marriage and have three or more children. Pray tell us how do you squeeze two parents, three children, one maid and possibly one or two elderly in-laws in a 1000 sq ft "bee-hive"?
 
When young, educated and mobile Singaporeans are short-changed on such basic "quality of life" aspirations as a truly-affordable and decent-size home for their loved ones, is it any wonder many are contemplating to be "quitters" rather than "stayers"?

1. And Singaporean are being fooled to believe that flats are being HEAVILY SUBSIDIED? Oh...my goosh ..67% profit! In that case, I really pity Chiam See Tong. Remembered he was once trying very hard to fight MBT on the basis of flat construction cost?
 
2. Now the situation is irreversible, because if they start selling you at the true market price, the market will be in a mess.

Today, buying a flat is so difficult. You have to endure so much barriers and traps then you get the flat. And is it really so difficult to sell a flat to the citizen? Is there a need to come up with so many gimmicks and rules to sell it?

When new flats are under demand, they jack up the resale flat price with a top up cash value on top of valuation, bank start charging 4% cash of resale flat price out-front and 5% interest. Majority can't afford the initial payment LPPL go back to look at new flats, suckers then raised the price of new flats so that they can be inline or slightly lower than the already rocket high resale flats price. End up old flats or new flats also very high price, worst still now, new flats become over demand, and they come up with horse bull pattern to delay people from buying, HDB is a sucker, we are all losers. No offense, but during my time when new flats are under demand, Seng Kang and Pungol are at the bottom of everybody

In principle I tend to agreed with you in more ways than one
 
there are several issues on the other side of the coin
 
1. when HDB was selling really cheap, while the property market was shootig through the roof, many heartlanders too advantage of the situation and buy and sell flat which resulted in return of surplus cash in hand. this had resulted in many first timer being unable to purchase flats
 
2. many flats that are plain and lack of design, were often not sort after and often has poor uptake, sillyporeans demand this and that with upgrades and expect their property price (including HBD) to rise every year even if for a few percentrage point, with the running up to recent election, HDB has adjusted their prices (politically) so as to give the 80%+ population who stays in HDB a sense of progress and prosperity
 
3. There are still cheap HDB housing, such as in woodlands and seng kang but sillyporeans are choosy and want choice location and cheap. this is unlikely to happen any time soon.
 
4. The government are a highly competent organisation and their multi-dollar salary ministers to "earn" their salary should commensurate with their results and not benchmark with the average in the region after all their salary is out of the scale for any benchmark in the world. It is probably in the guiness book of records
 
5. There is an apparent lack of accountability, there is a security lapse with the result of the escape of the worst terrorist ever known here in sillypore that has tried to bomb a plane in changi, during which time, there the minister involved was no where in sight of giving an explaination on how the MAT fellow escape. Our MM has to come out to say, sillyporeans are too cosy thinking that the government will take care of everything. strange that they are imposing everything on us ranging from work, education, how our children going to be demoralised by not getting into a good class, how many children you have, how to find a boy / girlfriend and etc..... it is their own doing
 
On the other hand, we sillyporeans are also to blame, know how to complain but does not know how to help to correct the situation. Only know how to say, cannot be help what..... we going into a vicious cycle again......
 
 
i HAVE written before, how to control sillyporeans
 
the easiest throught debt
 
if you are in constant debt would want to play play and try something new every 5 years

1. I can tell you guys that living in the newer HDB might be better than living in a small landed house. Ever came acorss, tiny freehold "landed" single/double storey house which you can't even park a car? On a hot day, it is like "oven"! They are just slightly more expensive than your premium HDB flat or even at par.
 
2. 999 is as good as freehold. In some countries, 60 years lease hold is already consider a blessing liao.

Freehold means perpetual ownership. But don't forget that the Govt reserve the right to change a Freehold to a leasehold with X number of years and they have done it before.
 
999, how long can you live? Hence, most people would see it as good as freehold.

It's too late to do much anyway. Imagine if you will, what if the government suddently go crazy, and implement some new policies that will drastically reduce the price of HDB flats? Just so that flats are now more affordable?
 
Then over 90% of the peopl will end up holding a piece of property that has drastically reduced in value, which politically is an extremely bad move. Imagine you bough a 5 room flat at say $450K, then suddenly over nigh, it's value fell by a half.
 
A much better move by the way, is to make sure everybody is keeping up and making more money. So the spiralling upward price of everything, is much less painful, and much less felt.

Actually I'm one of those so called middle-income couples. And I'm the sole breadwinner somemore. The only consolation is my flat was bought much cheaper when the market was down, and the amount of loan repayment I had to make is rather small, so my housing loan is well covered with CPF payments.
 
But if I lost my job, then it will be big problem for me....

Problem is, people said the exact opposite when HDB was doing that last time.
 
PAST - flat quality ok, people say HDB should built better quality flats to match condos.
 
NOW - flat quality match condos (or almost match), you say HDB should just build basic flats.

Today, buying a flat is so difficult. You have to endure so much barriers and traps then you get the flat. And is it really so difficult to sell a flat to the citizen? Is there a need to come up with so many gimmicks and rules to sell it?

Majority can't afford the initial payment LPPL go back to look at new flats, suckers then raised the price of new flats so that they can be inline or slightly lower than the already rocket high resale flats price. End up old flats or new flats also very high price, worst still now, new flats become over demand, and they come up with horse bull pattern to delay people from buying, HDB is a sucker, we are all losers. No offense, but during my time when new flats are under demand, Seng Kang and Pungol are at the bottom of everybody

ask those who stay on NE line and use the daily free treadmill provided at dhoby ghuat...I think only Changi Airport treadmill is longer.
 
but the punggol/ sengkang location is great for those who work in loayang/ airport area or even tampines/ hougang.
 
other than fitting the location to your own lifestyle/ family planning needs, dun buy into the BS HDB churns out. 
 
Bad enough to live with the mkt "subsidised" flats BS, must be a robert to buy into the water front living blah blah blah...

I think longkang front is more suitable.. 
 
HDB is not like the HDB previously. They are now so profit driven that it's no longer public housing. Think their mission statement shd change.  
 
 
Agree that buying a home shd suit a person's lifestyle. but sadly, people equate buying a home to buying a house for investment. 
 
They tend to look at location, location, location... hoping to cash it out big in future.

yeah la...HDB sales also got gimmicks.say can get this subsidy...dat subsidy...but make it so hard for buyers to get them.de latest was de additional housing grant(AHG).to b eleigible for de grant...buyer hv to produce 2yrs of payslips!who de hell keep pay slips for 2 yrs?!?!...mayb there r...but not me...n not those who i know.my fren had to go back to his previous workplace...pay them to get de payslips.so troublesome. 
now i'm waiting for de next bi-mthly sale to try n apply for a flat.but based on de the other thread another forumer posted...i tink dat chance is pretty slim now.

 
typical example of heavily susidised projects include lift upgrade... they said 3 room flat is subsidised by up to 95%. Yet owners are expected to pay a few hundred bucks.... if u do the calculation, each lift upgrade cost a few million dollars???

count yrself Heng. 
 
i got my pigeon hole at "peak" price for a ulu location.  govt did not revised SP of new flats at that time despite public keep writing in to complain that the resale market was at the lowest.  they caved in n revised 1wk after i signed the dotted line.  the difference was about 50k for flats in my area. 
 
now even with seller market, i can't even sell at the price where it can cover the repayment interest for using cpf

Problem is, people said the exact opposite when HDB was doing that last time.  
PAST - flat quality ok, people say HDB should built better quality flats to match condos. 
 
NOW - flat quality match condos (or almost match), you say HDB should just build basic flats. 
 


 
i don't mind flats that was built using red bricks instead of pre-fab. 
 
now my pre-fab flat i got to ask my kids to tone down otherwise my neighbours will send love ltrs. 
 
on top of that, the workmanship is so terrible.  tiles were uneven and the grouting spilled all over the floor. 
 
worse was my flat costs more than the average as it was the pioneer of marketing gimmicks by hdb.

those of you who havent got married and still living with parents, be smart..save up as much as you can now..and go immediately into private housing the moment you can afford it..give 'public' housing a miss..since it's not much cheaper as compared to private housing..

 
If HDB cant afford liao then private house will be  
 
If save till can afford then maybe wait for too long liao..

well..at least can fork out for downpayment..and slowly pay off the loan..
 
since buy from HDB also need to pay loan..might as well pay abit more every month, but don't need to put up with all the crap from HDB..  
 
on top of that, condo got facilities..and maintainance fee not much diff from HDB lor..
 
season parking, wash car water, facilities all included in the maintenance fee..got security somemore..

Bro, you should apply for a public housing. After all, its a good hedge against inflation and can yield excellent rental returns! I'll definately get a HDB after i get married.

Many couples would like to have their own house after marriage and live together by themselves only.
 
For my case, I am staying with my parents. We moved together into new HDB, bought a 5 room at about $250K (5 years ago). 
 
We are happy staying in HBD.

Not true. Many who stays in private can still hold on to their HDB if they got the HDB first. 
 
However, if you got private before HDB, then you are not allowed to buy HDB.
 
On top of that, they can rent out the entire HDB flat.

The gist of the 'game' is to tie down the peasants who have to repay a life long loan and in doing so they will continue to service for a life time, by paying all other forms of taxes! 
 
Whether you consider that you're being ripped off or not by the MIW is a relative point of view!
 
One thing is sure about humans ( at least those who are always complaining!  ), you take a neccescity in life ( housing for example), set rules that will play out advantageous for the rule setter, and you can tune and change the lifestyles and choices of the peasants at the 'click' of the fingers!

Terrace house, bundaglow ar?  
 
btw, what is freehold terrace house? equal to 999 years ?

 
1. I can tell you guys that living in the newer HDB might be better than living in a small landed house. Ever came acorss, tiny freehold "landed" single/double storey house which you can't even park a car? On a hot day, it is like "oven"! They are just slightly more expensive than your premium HDB flat or even at par.
 
2. 999 is as good as freehold. In some countries, 60 years lease hold is already consider a blessing liao.
 
Regards,
 
IMHO, unless u like gardening or have many cars, apartment is better. in the SG context at least.. those western countries with waterfront housing or country bungalow different story la 
 
i moved from HDB to terrace n back again.. phew..

eh.. I think you misunderstood the context of my post. 
 
I was inferring that people are buying their "home" based on location of popularity rather than their own needs. Thus it resulted in people moving all over S'pore. 
 
People staying in East coming to the West to work. From AMK to Jurong. From Bt Batok to Changi. If there's effort to realign where they stay and where to work. maybe it will help to optimise things. 
 
but wishful thinking.

flats generally more affordable in ulu places n most would rather work near coy. 
 
but if coy moves, close shop, change jobs then really no choice but to travel all over the place.  imo, last time bus svc more competitive.  got pte operator using non-aircon bus which i don't mind cos lower cost, frequent svc. now public tpt takes away duplicate svcs = longer waitg time for bus, frequent bus break down n also force competitors out of market.

Its not easy to realign where you stay and work. Most job openings are available in work places all over singapore. Even if let's say you now work in the west and you stay in the west, but who knows that if a very good new job opening comes along and it is in the east, most will still consider to take that new job even if it is located far away. Unless you specialise in certain kind of professions of which the workplace are usually specifically located in certain part of the country. For e.g investment banker. office definitely in CBD.

Agree with you about the part about do not follow the crowd.    Often, by the time you buy, it's already on the high-side. 
 
But buying the cheapest HDB area, even if the return is good may not translate to actual gain to most people. Cos they still need a roof of their head...selling high often mean buying high too. 
 
During the boom, I was offered in excess of $680k for my 5-rm HDB....but I couldn't benefit from the boom...cos I only have 1 property at the time and it doesn't make sense to sell it and then buy another one at a high price. Some adviced me to move to a more ulu place...but  if that was what I want...I would have bought a condo in those area in the 1st place.

Even if I start saving now for a place, the salary increment cannot match up to the housing price increment. So unless I kena bei bio or come out with some scam, otherwise how to chase the roof price? 
 
So perpetually, one becomes a willing slave for the garmen. Almost all your salary will go back to HDB instalment (garmen), COE (garmen), ERP (garmen), GST (garmen), Season Parking (garmen), Smoking (garmen), income tax (garmen), CPF (garmen), hospital bill (garmen), summon for littering (garmen)

there's another option.. QUIT.  
but do your homework.. cos depending on location, the new host country may not be better. look at it as an overall 'package'
 
if not, just try to work around it.. 
HDB instalment: stay with parents
COE, ERP, Season Parking: dun drive.. walk, cycle or take bus, take occasional taxi only when necessary
GST: buy less.. only the necessary loh..
Smoking: quit.. healthy too
income tax: direct tax in sg is considered very low leow..
CPF: well, if u can, be your own boss, try avoid contributing to it
hospital bill: be healthy will delay the need to visit them
summon for littering: dun litter lah..good for the environment
