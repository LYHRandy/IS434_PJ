Do you think the trend is going up over the next few years?
 

And will properties in the central region appreciate more than in the non-central region?

Even with recent news of property prices speculated to dip in the next few years due to the many launches, i doubt we will really see prices crashing down. Singapore being a small nation with limited land mass we should always expect property prices to climb slowly. More so for the central district areas than the outskirts. 
 

Investing in property is still probably one of the best ways to get a steady return in Singapore. Many have profited from capital gains and rental yield over the past few years while interest rates were kept low. But there is still much more opportunity in the years ahead! Definitely worth looking into the property market even more.

Property will never, ever crash again. There are policies to keep the prices stable. (e.g. FDI, bring in MNCs, import more FTs)
 

The Asia financial crisis, SARS, 911 & global finacial crisis will never happen again, even have, will not affect the small red dot.
 

Please invest in property. 
 

Thank you.

I'm not a property guru.... so here is my coffeeshop opinions
 

1) Property prices will not crash. But there should be a price correction which shall spread out over 2-3 years. Price correction doesn't mean it will drop. Just that the raise will be slower

2) Mass market condos will still lead in price increase. I don't see high-end properties breaking anymore price records. The gap between them should narrow

3) En-bloc activities are coming up again and the trend is for developers to build more mass market condos. This will again reinforce point (2).

No...no...in fact, buy somemore. The world is oredi in crisis but s'pore will never ever be affected. The US, Europe, Japan problems and the impending China meltdown is juz a myth by the world's media. It never happened. Man has oso never gone to the moon and WW2 did not happen. The last S'pore property downturn 1997-2005 is oso a myth. So are the Dubai, Japan, US burst property bubbles. So, prices are ever only going straight up here and property cycles and macroeconomic factors do not affect singapore.

Wrong, you make money by buying pty, not selling them for handsome profits.
 

Invest in commercial pty with high ROI or pty with sitting tenant in overseas countries, ie. UK or Australia/China

Well it is more of looking at a macro perspective of things, even if you think that there is a storm brewing, you will never really know the magnitude and it will not last forever. An investor looks more at the long term investment rather than just the short term capital gain. There are different ways to manage your investment portfolio and property investment does not just stop at residential. Try to discuss more with active property investors more for insights

Soya was 70% correct to say Sp will not be affected by macroeconomics, American has 92 millions deeply affected by baby-boomers, who retired poor or bloke.
 

Our types of income are graded by demographics / Supply & Demand factors and definitely based on BMV ( Below Market Value )
 

Here, if we can have 4-6% yields, it is ok to go in, more than 8% above would be wonderful, but you can find only in Industrial and commercial pty only, cant say much on landed/non-landed.
 

The fact is many of us are afraid of losing out when coming to invest pty, scared of tsunami, fear of losing out, and want stuff that are free of charge.

Bottom line, many waited too long to go in, they wanted to watch things happen and later why others makes money by selling off.
 

Sp is too small nation to be rooted with the micro aspect, let alone rising of the dragon.
 

p/s: If you see no body go in and buy, it is the best time to buy, however if you see ppl queing up to buy, then I reckon it's too late liao !!

yep, my view is that healthy and real demand is when one owns at most 2 properties.
 

i think perhaps a group of speculator thinks it will go up further and hold on to >2 properties.

Bank will see your income, if you are buying the property for stay.

If you buy to invest, they probably will look at the rental prospect with the 30-40% as their buffer for property price fluctuation.

Landed pricing will not fall...thats the truth...in fact prices for landed is now being transacted at prices higher than the last boom...it goes to show that landed prices will dip but rebound very fast as supply is very limited. And for property, if you can't sell it, you can always rent it out unlike stocks.

Can't blame them. 
 

After so many sets "peeing" measures + 1 "heavyweight" minster stepping down, ppty price index show no signs of abating.
 

The supposed "looming" supply in 2013 is not scaring anyone bec they just open the floodgates bigger for more "qualified" foreigners to soak up the excess units.

Land scarcity in Singapore and the rule of supply and demand will dictate.
 

If target population of 6 million is to be believed and the incremental growth were to come from higher-level FT-to-PR/Citizen conversions and additions ...
 

For central core districts (D.9 and D.10), landed property ... especially GCBs will rulez.  

One word:  Scarcity.  Up prices.  China-money, India-money, Indon-money.

Semi-D and Terrace rentals in D.9 and D.10 growing very strongly from increasing expat demand. Corporate money, generally.
 

For central core districts (D.9 and D.10), condos/apartments ... only one way: Up prices.

Again, supported by limited land availability and new condos being built in D.9 and D.10, and further supported by strengthening rental demand from the flood of expats expected.
 

For the other outlying, outskirt (meaning all the other) districts, a lot depends on supply and demand.  

Many condos coming to ToP from building rush over the last 2-4 years.  

The expected short-term supply glut may dominate over the next few years in these districts.

Expat demand for rentals also not as high, compared to D.9 and D.10 areas.
 

This is just my take on the situation / outlook.

Back then at the peak of the market
 

1) Enbloc sales being carried out or being proposed at private estates

2) Record sale prices by developers

3) Buyers queuing overnight with long queue lines at launches

4) Influx of foreigners buying properties
 

Then properties tumbled over 40% from the 2nd quarter of 1996 to the 4th quarter of 1998.

property can crash lah of course, as LKY said before nothing goes up forever, got to come down when :
 

-> US Fed interest now is 0.5% if raise to 4-5% to fight inflation sg loan rates also at 4-5% 

-> when world economy is down considering sg is a trade related economy, got retrenchments, 

pay cut cannot service loans, expats leaving singapore as no jobs cannot pay rent

-> When using rental income to service mortage not possible as economy bad, property 

deflation, valuation drops by 30%, banks require those own housing loan to top up in cash 

as valuation drops or foreclose the property

HDB moves will lead to more balanced housing supply-demand, says CS
 

By UMA SHANKARI
 

(SINGAPORE) Two recent policy shifts by the Housing & Development Board (HDB) - the move away from the build-to-order system and the plan to raise income ceilings for buying new HDB flats - may cannibalise the market for mass-market private homes, Credit Suisse said in a new report yesterday.
 

HDB announced the changes last week. The government agency is trying to make its public flats more attractive to couples hunting for their first homes. It will also ramp up the supply of new flats in 2011 and 2012.
 

The changes will lead to a 'more balanced' housing supply-demand situation, Credit Suisse analysts said.
 

'Affordable housing for Singapore citizens, following the recent years' surge in residential property prices, has been one of the most hotly-debated issues of the general elections. In our view, this space is likely to see the most meaningful longer-term policy changes, especially with the appointment of a new Minister of National Development, Khaw Boon Wan,' said the report.
 

On top of this, the bank expects the government to try to strike a better balance between GDP growth and the quality of living for Singaporeans.
 

Hence, over the medium term, Credit Suisse economist Kun Lung Wu expects population growth to slow to 1-2 per cent and real GDP growth to slow to about 4 per cent - although the bank said GDP growth will still hit 6.5 per cent in 2011 and 5 per cent in 2012.
 

All these factors combined should lead to a more balanced demand and supply situation over the next three to five years and result in more moderate price appreciation in the residential sector, the report said.
 

'We expect price moderation with more government supply, but prices are unlikely to slump in near term on strong economic fundamentals, strong balance sheets and low interest rates,' the bank's analysts said.



The bank also did a sensitivity analysis, which showed that the expected completions of an average of 14,500 private homes a year from 2011 to 2014 could be absorbed by the market - provided immigration growth remains at or above 70,000 a year (below the 150,000 average from 2005 to 2009), with a household size of five persons.



For equity plays, Credit Suisse also said it prefers hospitality, retail and prime office plays as it expects the mass market residential sector to face the most headwinds.
 

The bank issued fresh 'outperform' calls on Overseas Union Enterprise (OUE) and City Developments for their hospitality and prime office exposure.
 

Credit Suisse also gave 'outperform' ratings to three trusts - CapitaMall Trust, CDL Hospitality Trusts and Mapletree Commercial Trust.

The mass market private residential sector is too artificial. Prices jacked to unrealistic levels due to min regulation from authorities.
 

Premium lux developments are a different ballgame with so many rich people pumping in money here for obvious reasons.

There's always a cycle... and what goes up must come down. Herd mentality is what rules their head when people are still buying at peak prices.

Dun be too sure. Yes, if onli got 1 loan for home occupation and LTV ratio is comfy. Even if miss a few payments, banks will prob help to restructure loan to reduce instalment and lengthen tenure. 
 

But there are alot of overstretched buyers out there now who are on max 80% (or even 90%), 30-35yr loans for their 2nd or 3rd property. Assuming the property is valued at $1.5M during peak mkt purchase, 80% margin financing is $1.2M. In a mkt downturn, valuation could easily drop to $1.3M. 80% of $1.3M is $1.04M. If buyer is the risky type, banks may margin call $160k.

Actually i hope property prices come off 30% - 50%, then we'll see who are really the steady ones.

I'm a newbie so forgive me if I'm wrong.
 

My view is that the market will still remain buoyant fueled by siphoned off inputs from China and USA. 
 

The key to look out for is changes in China where the bubble is growing rapidly and shock actions by the 

Chinese government would see US drawing back or holding funds and the funds from PRC in SG would see

a major outflow, preciptating a market panic. My view is late 2012 based on current situation. 
 

Also, another interesting portion I'm considering is the gold prices and projection nearing end of recession.
 

Double whammy?

Inflated through foreign funds.
 

I think when s--t hits the fan, or the Yangtze river, all these funds will drain out overnight, interest rates will shoot up and run the cycle all over again...
 

My view is that property should still be climbing for the time being and the batch of people buying now at their limit will probably face the music in the next few years. (ok actually my earlier prediction was 2016-2018 for the devastating one, one mini 2012, one major).
 

Now all conflicting signs in the market and data is tumbled as you mentioned, so falling back on historical movements and waiting for the sign to offload. 
 

Shorting the yen previously made me a comfortable sum but hope it's enough to weather the storm.

tink 2016-2018 too long liao. yes, property cycles traditionally used to be 10-yrs. now the experts are saying more like 7. the current boom started in 2006. if they are right, the party shld end in 2013.....which oso happens to coincide wif the estimated oversupply glut, interest rate hike and a host of other s--t. if not for the latest round of punitive cooling measures, can still play-play a year more but how to exit meaningfully wif 12-16% SSD after factoring in 40% capital? plus KBW gonna flood the mkt wif hdb (aka reduce overall demand), ICA will reduce FT intake (aka reduce overall demand) and MND prob gonna restrict foreign purchase to onli a certain segment of the mkt (aka reduce overall demand).

Shouldn't one peak be higher than the previous peak? we are just slightly above 1997 prices according to the ura index...looks like we still have some upside to go....with a population of six million we will have plenty of demand...

Hi Chemmie, have the same view as you.
 

If only established markets then I would agree with Soya, 2013. It's simply too little, too late. Large portion of pte market is banking on KBW's 'reforms' to re-enter the public market, hence driving down highly resistant sky high prices in an expanding property market with likely over-supply. Big 5 are going into commercial property and wouldn't touch pte residential property with a 5ft stick. Now matter of seeing how long the inflated pte market prices can last until it realises it's already at/near peak.
 

Then the question mark is how long can PRC grow the bubble before it pops, similiar situation except market wide phenomenon. 
 

Currently looks to me like 2013 is localised correction and 2016-2018 PRC bubble pop.
