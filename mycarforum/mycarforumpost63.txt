anyone did renovation to their flat in the past six months ?
 

got reliable renovation company to recommend ?
 

not doing fanciful reno ... eg no customized furniture except the kitchen cabinet, so dun really need ID but more like a supervisor to get the job done.
 

alternatively, can also tell me which company to stay away from.

Renotalk. But it is luck of the draw. Good contractor can become very bad if they are swamped with more work than they can supervise.

Go for those that your friends or relatives who gave thumbs-up from their experience.
 

My colleague saw one ads below his block and hired the contractor. End up his kitchen and living room are not done yet despite passing the deadline by 1 month and now he's going to go to the Small Claims Tribunal 'cos the contractor has disappeared and does not answer his calls.
 

Best is the sub-con turned up at his house and said that the main-con asked him to do so 'cos the sub-con is waiting for $ collection for 3 jobs. From the sub-con, my colleague's case is not the worst, there are 2 more customers who are in worse conditions than him.

tried the reno forums ... including the above ... but seems like most ppl disappear after their reno is done. so its almost impossible to get feedback.
 

and frankly, when those with a couple of posts reply, you can't help but wonder if they are the contractors themselves ?
 

i tried emailing a few forumers there but same thing ... no reply.

... but none of my relatives did reno recently ... most are still living in their more than 15 yr old flats ... lastest is a colleague whose contractor was late in completion for almost 1 month, for which for 1 week, had to put them up in hotel !! then after they moved in, the reno-coy had to come in on a few weekends to do the carpentry.
 

and my concern is like what you and others had mentioned - the disappearing contractors.

I have been reading Renotalk for few months, wanted to renovate my house including re-doing the whole kitchen. for a few contacts for contractors and asking them to quote. I dun need an ID but a season contractors who has been working on similar concept that I have I mind. 
 

There are a few mentioned in Renotalk, just ask the forumer for the contact. many have post photo of their renovation where you can decide which contact actor you want to go with.

I think good or no good is the contractor the reno co. use.
 

most of them did their job, collect all money and they will not be responsible for any more touch up or replacement etc.
 

I pm you to AVOID a contractor co. So make sure if you walk in to any reno co. , ask them what contractor they use. IMO hope it helps!

Reno co is  a string. You walk in , they will have an interior designer to plan all for you. After planning and you agree with it, they will quote you.
 

Make sure you have to know every single material that you will use in your reno. Nowadays, many people chose to buy the material by their own and thought it will save a lot. My point of view, it is not true all the time.
 

I point out a simple case. If you are painting a 5 room flat, you let the contractors arrange everything and they will quote you one price, if you say you buy your own paint, make sure you have the knowledge how much to use. If not, you will be buying over and over again ( because they use 5 cans, they keep 2 cans unless you can be in the house when they work )...........brushes, pails etc not included. So do some calculation, whatever tiles, lightings, toilet etc............
 

I had a very bad experience that I overpaid a 5 star reno with 3 star quality. I leave everything to the company and end up, many of the materials are "salt water" stuff.
 
 

            Hope this helps!!! IMO

actually, i thought about the same thing ... in the showroom they can show you nice tiles of good quality ... but  we can't be sure that they won't use same design/look tile but the quality is inferior.
 

there is always this thing of over-promising and under-delivering and their contracts make it hard for the layman to pinpoint any discrepancies. The only good thing is we pay part by part ... but then again if they stop work due to indifferences, there will be a stalemate.

Another trick.... While renovating, do post in renotalk and make sure the contractor knows it.... Renotalk is a powerful site which reputable renovator will not dare ti mess with.... however, do be responsible and evaluate the renovator fairly. dont act like king and be served kao kao....

I did a reno last December...did the whole Kitchen (Tiles, tops and cabinets) and re-wallpaper and repainting plus the added stuff that usually my wife is adding on (you know how it goes)...I was at my place (yes clear leave before year end to supervise on-site my renovation but worth it though tiring as I can immediately say to add this to go this way myself not relying on the contractor to download the info to his guys doing the work)...got the chance to compare and view options also specially on tiles, taps etc..

It is safer to use a reno contractor that is a RADAC member, HDbay member, and if possible, also use a company that is ISO certified, and also been in business for at least 10 years. I used a company that has all the above profile for last 2 reno, with 2 different project coordinator, and also recommended to 2 other friends, all no problem

And I always KS get at least 3 to 5 quotations.. just to have a rough feel and compare a little and bargain a little. but unlike governments, I don't settle for the lowest price. Always remember, all the materials are different, if y order from same material, and different companies quote roughly the same, but got one that's super low price.. how can it be right? And lastly, I prefer to use a freindly and responsible coordinator as according to my gut feel..

Due to my frequent using and recommendation to friends, the coordinator actually did me a favour back when I change windows for 2 of my rooms.. my new tenants complain that they can hear road noise, so request that I change to double glaze windows. I sourced around for manufacturers of double glaze tinted window, and got a quote of 3.8k for 2 sets f windows including labour costs to remove existing window and installation. I called the usual contractor and he got a factory price for contractor and it was 1.5k.. exactly same specification.
 

That's how much is the margin for raw materials anyway.
 

The point is, ask around and don't always settle for lowest price.  One more thing is don't use relative's company in these kind of reno work. Spoils the good faith between kinship

I have few friends who used contractors with good/bad experience. There were some contractors who disappeared (closed down company) after collecting money. So now those "more kiasi" ones who wanna renovate will either find contractors that are highly recommended by friends/relatives OR pay a bit more to established ID company. 
 

But even using ID company, some people still get bad experience depending on the designer they work with. So it's better to get quotes from different companies, meet different designer and see which one you are most comfortable in working with. 
 

Most importantly, have everything agreed in black and white to avoid disputes in future. Some good things about using an ID company are that there is someone to manage and supervise the contractors/work process for you AND some form of "warranty". At least the established ones are more unlikely to close down suddenly. All these come with a cost of course. :)
 

Big firms like Unimax Interior Design, Weiken, Cissern etc all come with their fair share of good and bad reviews. 
 

In the end, it's still a matter of luck. :)

When it comes to big-ticket purchases like these, especially when it is something one has to live with for a long time to come, it is probably good not to give the business to someone whom you know (either directly or indirectly).

Even cheap reno can last for 10 years lah. I think people paying for standard  reno these days are paying more for the ID rather than what they use. 2 ID can charge $20k apart for using exactly the same materials.

I also stay 2-rm flat.
 
Because space is limited, a measuring tape will be your best friend. Buy a spare and leave it in the house. Once you get your keys measure all spaces and record down so that you can cross reference when you're shopping for furniture or appliances. Every mm counts and don't rely on the floor plan measurements because they won't be detailed enough.
 
You can also consider kitchen solutions from Ikea. Carpentry is fookin expensive.

Taking a lift together and casually chat anything, its that simple and easy  .

I also stay 2-rm flat.
 
Because space is limited, a measuring tape will be your best friend. Buy a spare and leave it in the house. Once you get your keys measure all spaces and record down so that you can cross reference when you're shopping for furniture or appliances. Every mm counts and don't rely on the floor plan measurements because they won't be detailed enough.
 
You can also consider kitchen solutions from Ikea. Carpentry is fookin expensive.

 
measure the lift and the lift opening soon. if cannot fit into the lift, the furniture/electrical shop might charge you extra carrying the furniture/fridge etc up the staircase, esp if you live on high floors.

You cant choose your neighbours, whether you buy new flat or resale flat. All depends on your luck, really.

For the lift just ask the sellers if there is any problem with delivering to hdb. They should know the lift size, i think it's quite standard. As long as on lift level no extra charge.
 
Neighbours confirm will kaypoh kaypoh each other's place when reno is going on.

True, neighbours always kpo when reno is going on. I remember when i reno my house before i moved into my flat, one neighbour came over to my flat to kpo and strike a conversation with me and tell me which unit she stays. But after i have moved in, i never meet this neighbour anymore outside the lift landing area?!

Can do recce. See if got Owe $ Pay $ on the wall.
 
Cos paint over still can see. The hang around the opposite block
 
to see who is the immediate neighbours. If both side young good
 
looking lesbians then put deposit immediately. Although no guarantee
 
they won't move out after you in.

Cant really see much even you recce. Can only eliminate owe $ Pay $ issue, but other problems like noisy neighbours, psycho neighbour etc, you would only know after you have moved in and stay. Lol. For example your neighbour upstairs like to drag furniture, stomp their feet or throw things on the floor, you would not know when you view the house that time.

Spend so much on hdb reno see the O$P$ outside the unit or at the lift also sian. People spend $1 million on a hdb flat to see graffiti at their lift lobby also sian. Bottom line is don't overpay for hdb reno or the hdb flat coz coming back to a nice home also includes the environment around your home,  not just the interior.

That' s very true especially neighbour upstairs like to drag furniture, stomp their feet or throw things on the floor,
 
This one just hope they have nice think carpet or rugs so less noise.
 
I also hate it when neighbours slam the door or gate.
 
When no one was looking I stuck small rubber pads to the
 
gate so when they slammed it it wasn't so loud.
 
My first two neighbours were really good, both young
 
couples and the wives were nice looking. Now rented out
 
to noisy people.

If your block is ghetto and if your reno too stand out , you might attract unnecessary attention that all your neighbours think that you are very rich.

Unfortunately for me yes.
 
One from the land of no more 1000 rupees
 
and the other from the want to take over
 
the world country. Everyday I pray for the 
 
young ladies from Korea and Japan with
 
the too little clothes and borrow sugar and
 
honey but the terrible ladies never come.

Maybe my expectation of too little clothes
 
is just too high. So I lowered my expectation
 
no clothes also never mind. But still no luck.

Nervous.. Next year taking keys liao.. Bought a 2-rm flat.. My brother told me not to look for ID, straight away go find carpenter.. cost cheaper..  
 
Getting more n more anxious, hope the renovation wont take all my saving away 

I'll start thinking of stupid stuff like " when to buy bed or fridge? what if cannot fit through the door how? alot of worries.. I think I'm just worrying for nothing...

For modern HDB, door widths are pretty standard. think around 1.2 to 1.5m wide. Just measure when you get your keys. Also, most furniture will fit through the doors. I think TV more than 70 inches cannot go into the lift or something like that. Fridge are alright since most is not deeper than 1.5m. Only thing to take note is if you are building a shoe rack in the living room, in front of the front door, make sure the gap is wide enough to move things through.
Kitchen appliances can buy just before the carpentry as they need to know the dimensions for your oven, sink, hob and hood or the fridge.

My unit already attracted attention before the reno (this is my second reno in three years) and it seems like the whole neighbourhood already knows my place was being renovated recently. Even the helper at the coffeeshop in the next block knows. No issues in the three years i've lived here as it's a pretty small neighbourhood and i'm one of the familiar faces.

You are simply rich sia. Lol. The first reno you have done not consider basic lo. Replace wiring and retiled toilet. But isnt it very troublesome to do a major reno at a short period of 3 years? Having to move your furniture away so troublesome.

GF moving in so bo pian need to rework the house layout for more wardrobe/storage space and a larger kitchen. Most of the furniture and appliances were sold on carousell or given away to friends/family. I only kept my storage bed/mattress and some crockery/pots/pans temporarily at my parents' place during the reno.
 
I'm not rich, just a case where the latest reno and outfitting costs are being shared between two people instead of just me alone. We wanted to move in together and worked out that it would be cheaper to renovate/refit than rent an apartment for two years and let my place sit empty. Plus it will probably add some value to the flat.

If have the budget, it is better to reno your existing house, esp you like the place. Costs shared between two people indeed much more easier. Lol.
