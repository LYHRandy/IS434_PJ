your valued opinion needed.
 
personally i dont think so but many do think it is
 
i cant understand a few issues here
 
hdb flat is for the people
hdb flat is subsidized
hdb flat upgrade ... tenants no money but can use CPF to pay for lifts  but this does not directly contribute to increased the money in the cpf, if this can be used this way why cant i use it to pay for my children's education
hdb flat should it be dont to compete with the private sector (eg apartments and condo), then how can business survive, a case in point ... seven eleven - cheers, Giant, cold storage - NTUC
hdb flat price also increased even more than private

You should have started a poll, so easier to see the reply. But I doubt the "many do think it is" statement.

HDB already said that their subsidy is a 'market subsidy', not a cost subsidy.
 
mainly means that they will price it lower than market, but will still grab ur hard earned money.

That's the price buying from HDB or the valuation price of a resale unit? If it's resale then it's not under HDB already mah.
 
Having said that, I don't subscribe to the notion that HDB sell their flats at subsidized prices... more like 'earn-less-than-they-would-have-liked' prices...
 
Cos if they did, it's DEFINITELY gonna cost THEM ... like maybe a chunk of the 66.6%

I'm asking if the price jump from $280k to $364k is the price of a flat to be bought from HDB or bought from the open (resale) market. If it's from the resale market, HDB is not in the picture.
 
Other point I was making is that I don't agree the HDB flats (bought direct from HDB) are at subsidized prices. It's at a 'affordable' price that still allows HDB to make a decent profit.
 
And if HDB were to really up the price of their flats, the unhappiness of the people will be felt by the government around 2010

i wrote to hdb about making the lift stop at even floors because presently they stop only on odd floors
 
they took a survey to see if everybody in the block is keen
 
in theory 50% of tenants will not benefit and what is the incentive for them to agree to an upgrade and pay a few thousand dollars
 
i wrote to hdb that hdb was built for the mass that is for the young and old
 
policy makers want families to stay with parents (elderly)
 
how to when elderly parents have twice knee surgery and had difficulty in climbing staircases
 
it is a design flaw without taking account that not everybody staying in the even floors without lifts are young and able
 
so if hdb is subsidized, what exactly is hdb subsidizing
 
they have not given me an answer yet
 
do you guys got an answer

I think hdb has a policy that help ppl earning no more than a certain amount per year. These ppl are entitle to get loan from hdb which can stretch 20 or 30 years with low interest rates. So that their monthly installment is kept low for them to make ends meet.
 
For those of u combine family income per year exceed that certain amount, u dun get this policy and pay as per normal.
 
As for those who mentioned prices of flats increase is bcos the prices for the building raw material increased by a few folds. Those in the construction coys will know. I'm in the engineering field, prices for metal inflated a few folds at one go and it keeps going up  .
 
As for lifts upgrading, I think the residents are not being forced to upgrade, they get to vote. I had seen a couple of blocks which didn't reach the 75% required vote to go ahead. Old ppl in the past had live with the situation of lifts not stopping at every floor for the past 20~30 years liao. IMO to some old folks it is not priority to have it.
 
If really want to kpkb, the point should be why it took hdb so long to come out with the 'lifts stopping at every floor' idea to help senior citizens?

Subsidized is too noble a word to be used in this context. To me it is more like a discount price. 
 
So for the coming Great Singaproe Sale, if you are looking forward to it (Not that i Gian), you are buying "subsidized" items not discounted items.

They contradict themselves again, on one hand, they want us to apply flat in non mature area as mature area very hot and popular right now and need lots of luck in order to get a house there. But on the other hand they want us to stay near parent. What if parent live in mature area. Like that how??

HDB flat is  never subsidized, it fact now HDB themself also never said the flat is subsidized, the use the word "discounted" from market price   . This is the reason why we never see any "cheap" HDB flat now.

Oh, if u happen to see the inside of the elevator shaft, most likely u'll see the 2 giant springs. These lifts design of the 70's are kind of primitive. Nowadays I think construction dig deep to the ground for the elevator shafts springs so that ppl dun have to climb a flight of steps.

U rich mah  , move from place to place. If u stayed in your first all the way until they give u enbloc notice, there's compensation $$. Even if u sell your first flat to move to another u have ready cash in a lump sum to buy another. It's not like some first time buyer gotto "start from scratch" whereby they might not have a lump sum of money to put into the flat.
 
U want everytime subsidized? I also want. Who dun want? Ppl sell their old flat can gain $$ plus subsidized ah? Eh, I also want.

In the past they boldly used the word 'subsidised'. After someone who is very saavy abt construction costs wrote in to ST forum with a very convincing point by point rebuttal of why he thinks HDB flats are not subsidised at all, the HDB spokesman quickly come out to clarify its a market subsidy and not actual subsidy. If no one make noise, they would still happily trying to hoodwink pple that its a real subsidy(not that everyone believes it but there are some who would). From then on, they also admit its just a discounted price from mkt price.

This issue was challenged by the opposition MPs about a decade back...
 
i could remember vaguely the following
 
1) cost price of 1 HDB flat: 10 to 15k (factor in inflation... maybe abt 20K ~25K now)
2) huge chunk is this "mkt subsidy" which is actually mkt adjustment tax... problem here is which mkt izzit base on to justify a few hundred K adjustment
3) what is the aim of the govt for chaining the 80% of the population to a life long debt
 
all these questions were posed but were never fully answered/replied by PeeAyePee then.. swept under the carpet or act blur...

mainly means that they will price it lower than market, but will still grab ur hard earned money.

 
You are absolutely right.  HDB flats are subsidised and yet they are not, depending on how you look at it.  Personally, I think market subsidy is meaningless to us as it straddles us with an ever-indreasing life-long hefty debt, just like a millstone around our necks. real subsidy is based on cost of building the flats
