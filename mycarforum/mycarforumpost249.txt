Smaller flats doesn't mean lower quality of living: HDB CEO
 

Posted: 10 November 2011 1355 hrs
 

SINGAPORE: Public flats in Singapore may be getting smaller but this has not lowered quality of living, says Housing and Development Board's (HDB) CEO Cheong Koon Hean.
 

Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a housing forum on Thursday morning, Dr Cheong noted that there were now fewer persons living in one flat which works out to increased living space per person.
 

"Our families are smaller. In the old days, we have very large families living in a flat. Today, the family is two, three, four (people)."
 

The size of HDB flats has shrunk by five to 10 per cent over the last 20 to 30 years.
 

For example, a five-room flat in Bukit Batok Central built in 1989 has a floor area of 121 square metres, compared to 110 square metres for a similar unit built in 2003.
 

Based on official surveys, the average household size was 3.5 in 2010, and 4.9 in 1980.
 

This means an occupant in a 110 square metre five-room flat today will have 31 sq metres of space, while a resident in a 121 sq metres five-room flat in the 80s had only about 25 sq metres of space.
 

Dr Cheong added that interior design also plays a part in creating good living space.
 

"In many global cities of the world or big cities, people do pay attention to how they do the inside of the flat as well as optimising the use of furniture and storage. It can be a very comfortable living environment."

But the reduction must be practical. I had a chance to look at some of the new HDB units of 3 and 4 rooms recently and I thank God i will not be staying there. The common bedroom and master bedroom are too small for other furniture after putting in the beds. The living room laggi worst. After putting a set of sofa and dining set, the living becomes too cramp. Sometimes, i really wonder if the HDB is building flats with people needs as their focus or is HDB designing flat base on number crunching software for optimization.

Making flats smaller will only feed the vicious cycle of smaller and smaller families. Looks like they have resigned to fate that our household size will never reach to the level 20 yrs ago.
 

Or perhaps they have to make it smaller to milk more psf and generate more revenue??

Compared to older flats, there is less walking space per room after minus the space taken up by the bed.
 

Should the bed size decrease like the size of the household too, Mr HDB CEO?
 

I don't believe the space occupied bed and furniture decrease like the decrease in household size.

is not difficult for HDB CEO to explain what....
 

HDB CEO salary about 100K in the 90s, now salary about $1m +; salary has increased 10fold for the same job.

So what is a 5 fold increase in HDB flats matter? Still cheap what?!

compared to a technician job in 90s which is 1k salary,if the same technician job now in 2011 commands min 5k+ salary,then that's a valid point.

Can ask him to take lower pay because it does not lower his standard of living?
 

LHL better get this guy out before he spoUts more rubbish and jeopardise 2016.
 

Instead of figuring out how to give more space to residents this guy gives excuses on his inability.

You must be able to read the report properly, the old flats are calculated by floor area which means living area (wall thickness and stuff not counted). New flats are calculated using gross area.
 

This is based on my limited knowledge, so if any forummers know otherwise please correct me.

Dear Dr Cheong,
 

I refer to your inspiring comments that smaller flats do not lower the standards of living.
 

I must say we ungrateful Singaporeans are blessed to have you as the HDB CEO tasked to lead the board to build world-class and yet heavily-subsidised, value-for-money flats for us. Many thanks!
 

I fully concur with you on your excellent analysis of the smaller flat not affecting our living standards & really paiseh to make a small request if it is acceptable to a great leader like yourself:
 

Is it possible to exchange our small humble 3-room HDB flat with your posh district 9 semi-D? 
 

Rest assured that your living standards as you have rightly put it will absolutely be not affected as you still can park your spanking-new Beemer 7-series in our many HDB car parks as well as being able to enjoy the many amendities around the estate. 
 

Did I also mention the vibrancy you will be able to immense in with the many quarrels, Mahjong-playing, KTV sessions & children's laughter we are fortunate to have every single day for the past 30 years?
 

You also can save some money as you need not fly to the Swiss Alps to feel the snowy feel as our neighbour below provides the free foggy feel everyday also with his Marlbor* ciggies. We simply love this!
 

If it is ok with you we will make the exchange tonight at 2359 yes?
 

Thank you so much for your time.
 

Hope you enjoy your stay in a HDB 3-room flat & the high standard of living we have been blessed to have since we moved in 30 years ago.
 

Yours truly,
 

Lim Ah Kow
 

P.S The kitchen toilet flushing system is out for the past 6 months but don't worry our good friend Muthu from next door would glady allow you & your family use theirs. And also the power has been cut off since LKY was the PM but again don't fret it because Ismail our neighbour from the other side is also a generous buddy who will allow you to go to their unit to use their power.

Thats what u get when the last MND visit HK and come back with all sorts of funny ideas...

Just be glad they dun built like those apt in HK island (in future, hard to say).

Their so call 3 rm apt is about 60sqm and cost hkd2.5M but can get cheaper and bigger apt from across the island and further inland...
 

HDB shrink is 1 thing...but price is scary.

3yrs ago Premium 4rm on 14 floor in Punggol cost 268k.

Latest BTO, Premium 4rm on 14 floor and 2 bus stop away cost 368k.

3 yrs increase 100k??? 
 

If the trend keeps going at 100k per 3 yrs, will only need 15yrs for to reach 1m in punggol...
 

According to sources, currently cost 80k to build a unit..

1 block = 96 unit x 250k = 24m for 99yr lease for land (excluding tax hor)

Land is indeed ex in SIN and punggol somemore... 

Wonder how much is those in mature estate..
 

But then again...citizens plays a part in it.

No buyer willing to pay high price, no seller will demand high price.

MIW should step in to control HDB prices 10yrs ago rather than follow market rate...

Now is too late for remedy le...
 

Buying at high price now, may not gurentee can sell for good profit 20 yrs later coz who knos by then economic melt down and start to see people jumping out of their windows.

Good luck to those who intend to cash in for their retirement 20 yrs later...a big gamble...

i concur with you. The escalating price is indeed a worrisome thing.
 

To optimise use of available space and flexibility in layout, it is of wonder why don't HDB build a common House Shelter to each block of flats ie. a staircase Storey Shelter(SS) instead of one HS to each flat. 
 

The HS in each flat takes up considerable amount of space, imposing design constraint to the flat' layout.

I note that as of recent, top level civil servants or their equivalents in quasi state owned enterprises have been very very vocal in expressing their opinion(s), presumably opinions which are sanctioned by their employers/organisations. Whereas in the past, the talking are usually then by our Ministars.
 

Is this representative of attempts to set up decoys and chaffs to deflect flak?

Smaller flats doesn't mean lower quality of living: HDB CEO
 

Posted: 10 November 2011 1355 hrs
 

SINGAPORE: Public flats in Singapore may be getting smaller but this has not lowered quality of living, says Housing and Development Board's (HDB) CEO Cheong Koon Hean.
 

Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a housing forum on Thursday morning, Dr Cheong noted that there were now fewer persons living in one flat which works out to increased living space per person.
 

"Our families are smaller. In the old days, we have very large families living in a flat. Today, the family is two, three, four (people)."
 

The size of HDB flats has shrunk by five to 10 per cent over the last 20 to 30 years.
 

For example, a five-room flat in Bukit Batok Central built in 1989 has a floor area of 121 square metres, compared to 110 square metres for a similar unit built in 2003.
 

Based on official surveys, the average household size was 3.5 in 2010, and 4.9 in 1980.
 

This means an occupant in a 110 square metre five-room flat today will have 31 sq metres of space, while a resident in a 121 sq metres five-room flat in the 80s had only about 25 sq metres of space.
 

Dr Cheong added that interior design also plays a part in creating good living space.
 

"In many global cities of the world or big cities, people do pay attention to how they do the inside of the flat as well as optimising the use of furniture and storage. It can be a very comfortable living environment."



 

Her reasoning is flawed.
 

1. "standard" fixtures do not reduce in size proportionally (ie. toilet seat stillt take up the same space as before, the toilet sink take up the same space as before ...)

2. We don't get 'billed' for air con ledges / balconies in the past
 

Her argument would be more sound if she were to discount all these 'fixture' spaces and divide the usable living space by the number of people in the household. Of course, her NOT using this line of argument is very telling of why she does not do so in the first place ....

I don't have 3.5 persons in my household.  I have FIVE.  So am I shortchanged if I live in 110sqm flat having only 21sqm as compared to 25sqm in the 1980s ?
 

I don't care what other global cities do to their inside of flat.  I care of my living space.

Everytime they compare with outside of SG to justify their actions.

But the reduction must be practical. I had a chance to look at some of the new HDB units of 3 and 4 rooms recently and I thank God i will not be staying there. The common bedroom and master bedroom are too small for other furniture after putting in the beds. The living room laggi worst. After putting a set of sofa and dining set, the living becomes too cramp. Sometimes, i really wonder if the HDB is building flats with people needs as their focus or is HDB designing flat base on number crunching software for optimization.




The only way to expand the "living space" in the future ?  I think they may even use Wall boards instead of Bricks as room partitions...

Just wait and see... it will be cheaper to install...

Then again you will still get only 110sqm for 5room flat and priced the same.

Can't believe a PhD can make such idiotic statements...
 

Making flats smaller will only feed the vicious cycle of smaller and smaller families. Looks like they have resigned to fate that our household size will never reach to the level 20 yrs ago.
 

Or perhaps they have to make it smaller to milk more psf and generate more revenue??




If you complain too much they will start to compare with HKG and TKY... you can't win one lah... SG soo small and need to accomodate 6.5 maybe 10 mil FTs. to increase GDP.  The size can only get smaller and the price can only get higher.

Bro..if you tell them you have five, and can afford to have 5 person (assuming its you, your wife and 3 kids) , then you can either :
 

1) Buy a resale....older units have bigger space. Well, you should be able to afford the COV since you can afford to have 3 kids

2) Buy a condo. 
 

They will tell you that you have options!

I think the problem is the architect preference to have rather long corridors leading from the living room to the bedrooms (master bedrooms included). It eats into the liveable floor area count and it actually contorts the rooms' aspect ratio into rectangles rather than squares (which i very much desire actually) I don't know whether this is correct but maybe they factor in the air-con ledge as part of the liveable floor area as well? This are my observations after taking a few glances at the floor plan(s) hosted on hdb.

interesting conversation you 'eavedropped' at chicago!! ........ any snow yet?
 

my observations while in Fukuoka (southern japan) last week:
 

lots of pple there cycle around (to work / shopping etc) and know how to behave and co-exist with pedestrians/drivers (footpath cum cycling track share the same space which is wide - about 4m on both sides of city main roads!
 

buses are not jam-packed and the drivers drive with consideration for the comfort of bus passengers.
 

bus engines stops whenever red light at junctions lasts more than 15 seconds (saved fuel and the environment)
 

orderly behaviours in public spaces (as expected).
 

the crowd is much smaller than tokyo but varieties of shops / food etc are just as good... good train networks and trains are less crowded
 

pple there respect personal space eg even in a crowd waiting to cross at traffic junction, they do maintain a decent gap between the next person, not breathing down others' collars
 

eveything works like clockwork, exact and hardly misses a beat

Thought you went TKY.  I didn't have chance to go Fukuoka...hope to experience it.

Yes Japanese can seemed to be arrogant in working environment but their civic mindedness is really admirable.

I never like US as I find the people here rather aggressive. 

Was in a Pub and talking with colleagues and their friends and there are more races in this PUB than G20 meeting.

US is really a Pariah Country.  Most people can't even speak English.  Do I want SG to move toward US openness to FTs ? a Big NO.

I can understand why Jpn still not very open to FTs. 

OK got to go... talk to you later when touchdown HKG...

Her excellent theory sama sama i.e. analogous to having a smaller paycheck may not mean one is not happy according to the survey done on workers recently.
 

Apparently folks with monthly 8-9k salary is much more happy than those earning 10k per month.
 

Wow this is like gospel to ignorant people like us

bcos by calling a flat with 4rm size a 5rm flat.. they could charge us the price of a 5rm flat mah...   [laugh] 



 

That's exactly what I thought too!   3rm size, they name 4rm. 4rm size, they name 5rm. Big difference in price you know.  
 

Move ahead 20 years, 3rm will be call EA, 4rm will be call single-deck EM, 5rm will be EC  :angry: I pity my children. Prices will probably be $3mil, $4mil and $5mil

Don't know if HDB still builds executive flats like in the good old days where people who wants bigger space can opt for it. 
 

HDB should continue if not reinstate this option for bigger families who need bigger space.

Small never mind. The worst is, most new flats interior layout has a lot of wasted space, space you can't utilise it except for walkway from entrance to hall to kitchen to bedrooms to toilet. You just can't put anything, do anything on it. Those who have lived in the old and new flats will know what I am talking about.

Actually the size of the flat also depends on how many people staying. If 1-2 persons staying, even the size of the flat same as hong kong, i also dont really mind. Cause i dont need such a big flat if only 2 persons. More importantly is the deco and furnishing in the house to make it cosy and comfortable, sometimes size doesnt really matters a lot.

agreed. but in the bigger picture this society cannot afford to just have people not producing kids. once you have kids in this new HDB, it becomes a different story
 

of course I can honestly say I don't give a d@mn as my wife and I don't intend to have kids and hope to migrate anyway. So yeah, we can live in a pigeonhole. we live in an old 3-room flat (the smaller type) in fact. Just nice for two. sometimes I feel that we could use more space but it'd cost more and need more effort to clean.
 

I had the privilege of growing up in one of those early 90s executive flats. My gosh it is HUGE. even played soccer and frisbee in the living room with my sister when we were younger. HDB builds nothing like that these days.
 

But of course, if push comes to shove, who says you die die must live in this country? accept it as a package or move on lo... especially if you endorsed this package during the GE.

if you enjoy simple HK food eg porridge / beehoon etc, grab some even if you are on transit at ChekLok airport 




Finally arrive HKG, my home away from home.

Now at United Club Lounge - no porridge today leh... In SQ lounge have. in Fact HKG SQ Lounge food is so much better than SQ longe in our Changi T1,2,3.

Shame on SQ...
 

HKG apartments are really small.  But it is due to more granite mountains than land.  Also its very Ex to build on soild rock...

SG still have the Southern and eastern Sea to "reclaim" land.

Soon Sentosa is in a Lagoon in the Northern part of SG.
 

Though I don't like what HDB do to reduce Flat size, its a matter of fact that they will reduce Public space to expand Private space for condos.

Face it, a piece of land slated for BTO flats = slower rate of increasing NR.  HDB is losing marnie every year to build subsidise flats so no choice must build smaller and more to maximise profits ...sorry minimise loss.

spot on!!   she / they can slant the 'story', but the facts remain............   



 

Heck... if we want to use her method of reasoning:
 

In the past, 1 block of flats ~12 stories high. So the 1 person space is actually 'shared' over 12 => each person= 25/12 = 2.08 sq meter of space

Present day, new flats easily double that number of storeys. So each person would have a share of 31/24 = 1.29sq meter of space 
 

Let's take it a bit further.

Personal space in the past = 2.08 sq meter

Personal space at present = 1.29 sq meter

Reduction in space = 2.08-1.29 = 0.79sq meter
 

% reduction in space = 0.79/2.08 = 0.379808 ~38%!!!
 

So while flats have "has shrunk by five to 10 per cent over the last 20 to 30 years", the personal space has reduced by almost 40%!!!!
 

So... even using her twisted logic, the 'truth' will still shine through.... haha

Its good for the govt to be prudent and not waste state money in govt spending, but for public housing, there's a need to subsidise the people who cant really afford other forms of housing which the private developers provide / sell.

Lack of flat land plots or suitable land to build housing is one thing. Another thing which you never mention is that alot of companies e.g. developers  have been hoarding land plots for as long as it has been allowed and just literally sitting on them. Property prices is mad there because of this. Nothing screws the market more than the damn supply vs demand elasticity. Damn!

Smaller flats doesn't mean lower quality of living: HDB CEO
 

Posted: 10 November 2011 1355 hrs
 

SINGAPORE: Public flats in Singapore may be getting smaller but this has not lowered quality of living, says Housing and Development Board's (HDB) CEO Cheong Koon Hean.
 

Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a housing forum on Thursday morning, Dr Cheong noted that there were now fewer persons living in one flat which works out to increased living space per person.
 

"Our families are smaller. In the old days, we have very large families living in a flat. Today, the family is two, three, four (people)."
 

The size of HDB flats has shrunk by five to 10 per cent over the last 20 to 30 years.
 

For example, a five-room flat in Bukit Batok Central built in 1989 has a floor area of 121 square metres, compared to 110 square metres for a similar unit built in 2003.
 

Based on official surveys, the average household size was 3.5 in 2010, and 4.9 in 1980.
 

This means an occupant in a 110 square metre five-room flat today will have 31 sq metres of space, while a resident in a 121 sq metres five-room flat in the 80s had only about 25 sq metres of space.
 

Dr Cheong added that interior design also plays a part in creating good living space.
 

"In many global cities of the world or big cities, people do pay attention to how they do the inside of the flat as well as optimising the use of furniture and storage. It can be a very comfortable living environment."

I believe his among the reasons the son threw out the old couple recently. Example: the average household size 3.5 was exceeded (2 + 1 +1=4). Poor old couple, even if stop at two you would still exceed the average household size (being Singaporeans). Now left high and dry because you broke the rules?

What the hell is this CEO talking?




U r mistaken

they simply import
 

how did you think they got 60% yes vote

about 20% of this 60% comes from new immigrants

i am sure they are ready to admit more new immigrants who will vote for them in order to ensure control of power

Her bedroom is so big, she can roll all over the place to experience all the kamasutra positions and maybe even have orgy parties.
 

Why she deny hdb dwellers same privilege????????
 

Maybe we can blame baby shortfall onto her. 
 

So next time the flat is even smaller so that we have to bath on top of our kitchen sink or cook inside our hall?

You can't possibly expect the HDB flat to be big and spacious right? 

It is sized exactly sufficient, to give you the "suffocating" effect psychologically , so that you want to work harder, and buy the biggest flat, you can afford.

No I don't expect the HDB flat to be big and spacious. 
 

Just expect the new flat is of reasonable size, like those 20 yrs old flat. 
 

Some of the new flats master bedroom cannot fit in King size bed and the common
 

room cannot fit Queen size. 
 

Nowadays those new couple can't even play catching inside their master bedroom.

price of HDB flats have increased significantly

size or floor area of HDB flats for supposed 3,4 or 5 room flats have decreased
 

so in short, is this what we call a double whammy

Compared to older flats, there is less walking space per room after minus the space taken up by the bed.
 

Should the bed size decrease like the size of the household too, Mr HDB CEO?
 

I don't believe the space occupied bed and furniture decrease like the decrease in household size.
 





 

Some folks like older flats like tiong bahru & kallang airport, I'm house-hunting too.

Worry is not the right word to use, we will be homeless soon . . . they keep telling us not to sell HDB flat, it's an asset.
 

How can we not sell to upgrade or downgrade, our lives need to improve for better or worse, look arounnd us in EC park and WC park, many tentage setting up overnite not for nothing, those rangers knew what is happening, they dun want to say more . . .

The only way to expand the "living space" in the future ?  I think they may even use Wall boards instead of Bricks as room partitions...

Just wait and see... it will be cheaper to install...

Then again you will still get only 110sqm for 5room flat and priced the same.

I think the problem is the architect preference to have rather long corridors leading from the living room to the bedrooms (master bedrooms included). It eats into the liveable floor area count and it actually contorts the rooms' aspect ratio into rectangles rather than squares (which i very much desire actually) I don't know whether this is correct but maybe they factor in the air-con ledge as part of the liveable floor area as well? This are my observations after taking a few glances at the floor plan(s) hosted on hdb.



 
 

U call them architect of HDN standard, my younder brother can even draw better, They simply cut and paste for many HDB project on the 70s-85s, till he retires and leave earth, that was when EC start coming in as replacement home for middle-class.
 

Even Malaysian architect copy us, slight slight alteration here and there

Bro Karter, HDB nvr lose money building flats for us, ( what they lose is dignity ), if that statement is true, then I reckon, they will go bankrupt earlier, rather than soldier on, I rem it is the Govt. promise to built subsidize flat for all Sinkies who voted for them, and this is wat they deliver to us, Yes, it's a decent size HDB flat, but smaller not bigger . . . get it !
 

The sizes getting smaller and smaller, macham burger chain, a filet-O-fish was $1.90/ then $2.10/, now it set meal of $4.00+/ to 5 i guess, and it no longer foam wrap, it's grease-proof paper ( What do we learnt from McDonald Rest ? )

Small never mind. The worst is, most new flats interior layout has a lot of wasted space, space you can't utilise it except for walkway from entrance to hall to kitchen to bedrooms to toilet. You just can't put anything, do anything on it. Those who have lived in the old and new flats will know what I am talking about.



 
 

Can any1 explain why they have to built HS ( Home shelter ) for HDB, is it a requirement, the damn door so heavy and useless, only for emergency purpose, Some1 say for war sake, my toes are laughing . . . hahahaha!

Don't know if HDB still builds executive flats like in the good old days where people who wants bigger space can opt for it. 
 

HDB should continue if not reinstate this option for bigger families who need bigger space.



 
 

Dun tink so, Bigger EA/EM can be found in Yishun and J West, if you want to live in those 10yrs and beyond, good to buy, at least 153-154m2, i was told, my fren lived in one

Lack of flat land plots or suitable land to build housing is one thing. Another thing which you never mention is that alot of companies e.g. developers  have been hoarding land plots for as long as it has been allowed and just literally sitting on them. Property prices is mad there because of this. Nothing screws the market more than the damn supply vs demand elasticity. Damn!




The land in HKG was only 50 years lease... so if you do you math theirs is confirm chop chop highest property prices in the world.

end users buy property may be on lease but 20 years ago when people like Li Ka Shing bought land plots also on lease terms?

HDB under Mah is unable to produce the above table, maybe HDB under Khaw can give us a breakdown of land cost, construction cost, and subsidy, so as to understand how the selling price is derive.
