last night during our weekly gathering, my uncle told us my cousin moving into her new BTO flat.
 
she got an installer to come to her flat to fix up the flat TV on the wall. however, when the installer came, he told her cannot .... and then he knocked on the "wall" and it turned out to be hollow !!
 
as such, he explained it will not be able to sustain the weight of the Tv over time.
 
in the end, he installed the bracket on the outlining solid wall instead of the partition inside the flat.
 
anyone else got new flats and the "walls" inside the house separating the bedrooms are plasterboard walls ?

It  is common nowadays, EC and condo also having gypsum board walls.
Easier if you want to demolish walls to reconfigure the layout. It is also cheaper and faster to build.

From 2015 onwards, it become mandatory for non-landed residential unit (HDB flats inclusive) to have certain % of walls (typically non-structural inner wall) to use drywall system, for increasing productivity and sustainability (less reliance on sand and cement).
 
These requirement falls under BCA's Building Control (Buildability and Productivity) Regulations 2011. Refer to Schedule 2 for the mandatory building systems and standard components to be used.
 
And here are some info pertaining to the quality of drywall system (gypsum board). Sound insulation properties is heavily dependent on the type of material used, and can be further enhanced through the use of rockwool.

The BCA brouchure says dry walls is only 15% weight of brick wall. 
 
I wonder whether poorly build condos and ECs can support an additional 85% weight of a brick wall?

Drywall is common in AM land. Your wifi will pass through better than concrete. With the right material also better noise insulation but not sure what HDB using.

Bottom part of wall is solid, hollow above a certain height. Should be able to mount TV using hollowblock anchors aka toggle bolts.

OK hollow walls.
 
I know 'buyer beware' but really do HDB inform buyers about this new feature.
 
I doubt buyers know this.
Prolly won't effect their decision but I've got a lot of paintings on my solid walls and don't think I'd have them on hollow walls.
 
Does bomb shelter have these hollow walls.
 
Don't you have to wait 5 years before allowed to do alterations in HDB.
By then got floor installed so not easy to make changes.

actually got pro and cons for me now that i know about and will be expecting this.
 
cons is i cannot anchor heavy things on the "wall".
 
pros is most probably i will knock down the plasterboard walls and install sliding doors between the bedrooms.

Cheaper options but price of HDB still same..

these photos look like offices, some of the flat/EC allow you to choose 3-4 bedroom and the drywall will be used for easy configuration.

This is old news. More dan 10years ago HDB already doing it on all kinds of flats.
My mum's place the masterbedroom door(the piece of wall above the door frame), toilets' wall all plasterboard. Why cannot hold the TV? The one I fix in my mum's masterbed room the not so flat TV has been up there for 10+ years. Next to it I even install a shelf to put dvd player and setup box. Who said cannot hold over time is big BS. It's not a paperwall.

drilling in this type of wall is much easier than brick wall, need a heavy duty drill and messy.

Yeah. I don't trust installers, they use cheapo steel screws that will rust. I used stainless steel self-tapping screws that don't require any drilling.

Actually, I much prefer drywall cos it is easier to run concealed wiring and easy enough to patch it up, light weight, better finishes and can specify the level of sound proofing I want. One of the earliest condo to use all drywall for the internal partition is Bayshore Park built in the 80's.

It is ppl's perception rather than reality. Drywall can hold weight if we specify or add reinforcement eg. plywood, etc it correctly.

From my friends, I think all new HBD have partition boards as walls.
 
partition boards are relatively soft. Knock your furniture on it, likely will have a hole.
 
Good thing is they can be easily tear down. You can run wires internally as well. If want wall mount TV, can partially tear down the wall, add in reinforcement and rebuild them.

There will be pro and cons whatever the building material is used. If ppl want to collect their flats earlier and don't to wait too long...I mean this is something you will have to accept. Anyway the construction materials I see is almost everything "hollow" to save on weight and cost.
 
Even your so call "solid wall" isn't that solid. Mostly hollowed out like this. That's why sometimes whatever your neighbour is doing you will hear it.

same here. 
 
I build a pc of drywall in one of my old flats before, but didnt use good sound proofing for it, just the basic one. Construction was fast, not so messy and dirty, surface was flat so  wall papering it was good, painting was also easy.  wiring was hidden inside and rewiring was easy. 
 
I also heck down and rebuild a "solid" cement block wall in another old flat, took a longer time for the wall to dry, and poor workmanship resulted in a full crack line along the perimeter of the joints. 
 
This is really good information on drywall sound insulation, the next time I rebuild and renovate my place, I might just know down all the walls and replace with good sound proofing drywall.

I believe the drive to rely on less sand (and corresponding cement) was due to a dispute with our neighbours many years ago who decided to suspend the sale of sand to Singapore to force us into submitting to their political will. 
For the sake of our sovereignty, this move is something Singaporean should support.
 
Of course as pointed out by others, the new construction method is faster and meets the need of young couples who were grumbling about the long waiting time for a BTO in the old days.

Sorry bro, this one I really got no answer for you, my last direct purchase from HDB was like 20 yrs ago. 
 
However, given it is HDB, even if BTO i dont think they will accept your request unless the ass-ons were offered as part of the selection.
 
But check with the officer in charge, they may  have changed their attitude, I cannot promise.  
 
those walls I build were all resale flats.

What u want done will be specified when u go down to sign the documents for your purchase of flat (flooring/doors etc).
The standard layout (like internal walls) will be as per the floor plan u received when deciding to purchase.
 
Anyway very standard one lah, other than the above options.

Nowadays Gypsum wall also have many type. 
I saw a brand DuraLine. It’s is designed for high impact resistance wall systems. It’s light and when you knock on it, it feels solid too & should be able to bear weight.

Spec is one thing. Is the installer willing to install also. If the installer say.. Wait a min I'm not sure. I rather not try it then can get screwed later on.
