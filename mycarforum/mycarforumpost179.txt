Why cannot afford leh? If borrow 80% at 800k for 30 years, each month repay about $3k. CPF can cover about $2k every month for both husband and wife, only need to top up $1k every month.

Yup. 2 bedroom penthouse. It's the EC at Sengkang to be released soon in Oct.Like everyone,Im perplexed as to how someone whose salary is less than 10k is able to afford the downpayment and monthly. It's just crazy. Hdb has got it all wrong this time. The prices of Ec should be waaaayyy lower than that say 400-600 for the biggest Ec. 
 

Now 2 bedroom ec starts at 640k. That's crazy.
 

We need a new housing minister that can help resolve this mess n make sure there are enough homes for Singaporeans first before they talk about welcoming foreigners.

Don't Really understand, If the Psf for a EC is so close to a Condo,why call it EC? The new EC at Buangkok ( esprina ) estimate Psf is $8++. For that kind of pricing, may as well go for a Condo instead with no restriction.

You gotta contact the agent to get the quotes. I did. She emailed me the forms etc. I was appalled at the prices. You can get a private condo like oasis at the very same price.

Forget that EC. If you have cash, go for the balance units at Kovan Residence ..around $8++ Psf..somemore TOP soon. Maybe can ask for a little discount from the Developer.

That is the problem now, the interest rate is low and hence pple are committing high loan quantum. When the increase rate increase to 3 to 4 percent, then it'll be a big problem for many pple and I expect the price will come down.

bro, floravale asking is about 740K lah but I think if you don't mind the lower floor sld be about 720-730K can get liao.
 

Btw, Floravale is about the cheapest in the west liao leh, next year go pte, I expect it to hit $800K by mid next year.
 

alot of my friends here, bought when new and sold away 2 years back, but ended up coming back, because cannot find any cheaper else where.
 

now is asking about 580psf, but even new EC are asking about 600psf, you think got logic or not, and not forgetting DBSS which has nothing is also pricing at about 500 to 550 psf.
 

how for the price to crash anytime soon?

Same here. Hoping for the market to crash. Hehe. If it does, yipees! However, although we were shrouded by a short economic crisis just recently,(Leeman brothers, bank crashed etc) , sadly 

, the prices still increased.
 

So it's like economy down-prices still increases. When economy is up- prices sky rocket. 
 

Looks like we are living in the age where our cpf will be 0 dollars

When they release EC 10yrs+ ago, the prices were really good le, much lower than a private condo.
 

I am one of the buyer of one of the development.
 

And now the resale value of all the old EC is much higher than their launch price. 
 

But I am happy with my place, no intention to sell it la, I never bought it for investment anyway.

Jalan Kayu is one of the worse places to buy a landed property.
 

One big minus point is the very narrow lanes, units without sufficient car lots making owner park at kerb side.
 

Thats why its cheap.  Many more minuses that I should not elaborate.

yes, cluster housing has the best of both world, landed housing with condo facilities and 24 hour guard house and door step basement carpark for 2 cars. ......................only down side is the houses are very closely builded together yard to yard.

is "Cluster Housing" a new term though???
 

sorry, i'm quite new to such terms....
 

but i did read somewhere that Land Developers are pushing towards such direction for landed properties,
 

to not only have the "Land Area", but also amenities to match condominiums....
 

amenities such as private swimming pools, at least 2 parking lots for each apartment, etc etc....
 

but the land it occupies is also somewhat small too right???
 

can't compare with EC's or condominiums....

no, the term is not new, the idea started some 20 years back I think, IIRC...........
 

yes the land they sit on is smaller...................compare to EC or condo, you get a smaller project, so is like everyone knows everyone, more like last time kumpong like that.....unlike EC or condo, where you get a few hundred units...............
 

the idea did not kick off well because it was more of like a hybrid kind of housing and not easy to get land of such sizes.

Jalan Kayu is one of the worse places to buy a landed property.
 

One big minus point is the very narrow lanes, units without sufficient car lots making owner park at kerb side.
 

Thats why its cheap.  Many more minuses that I should not elaborate.
 

Caveat emptor.



 

carpark quite limited i agree and i hate those jam at jalan kayu whenever i drop by my bil place for dinner... even with those -ve.... if let me choose, landed for me anytime and no condo pls... i always think condo is basically a spiced up hdb flat because when you are doing the bombing business, someone actually doing it onto of your head....  ... did i mentioned i stay at top floor of hdb?...... 
 

and btw, at least landed at jalan kayu no flood no matter how heavy the rain is..........

a family with young children may like the amenities of a condominium rather than Landed....
 

at least there's a swimming pool just downstairs....
 

but surprisingly,
 

not many residents actually use the pool or gym or clubhouse facilities frequently, to take advantage of the place they live in....

well, the bigger the lower the psf that is 1 point. location is another point, most condos are build somewhere near to buses or MRT, but landed no car you need to walk like a dog......landed are more like last time the kumpong houses....................just cost more! also because FT cannot buy landed, landed can only sell to locals and PRs.......investment,,,condo easier to rent out.
 

I used to love landed when I was younger, now I pass by them everyday and no  I will not not buy a landed anymore, expect a cluster house, if the land at JW st 42 builds EC, I may go back there and buy a penhouse tho......

Why cannot afford leh? If borrow 80% at 800k for 30 years, each month repay about $3k. CPF can cover about $2k every month for both husband and wife, only need to top up $1k every month.



 
 

Sure, as long as you dont screw up too badly within your next 30 years.

where $2k is paid via the CPF, and $1k in cash,
 

wouldn't that mean there would be no money in the CPF at all after 30yrs???
 

and fancy the interest rate goes up like crazy anytime in the future,
 

the loan may be twice as much as what they're servicing now....

Cluster bungalow or at least semi d is still acceptable.
 

cluster terrace usually very narrow as developers squeeze every inch of space possible to get the GFA per unit up.

Cluster terrace land size mostly no more than 1500sft but built up is easily 3500sft + roof terrace

mostly narrow and gives very cramp feeling.
 

I did consider buying cluster semi d or bungalow at braddell hts but changed my mind as only 2 adults and 2 children staying.

So bought a simple landed terrace instead.
 

Hopefully next time children grow up, i save more money maybe buy a 3500 sft landed semi D.

up to 120% of valuation cost.
 

so say your property is 100K. you can used up to 120K (including interest) of you CPF. so if your loan period you did not exceed 120K you dont have to use cash bah...

Yes there is a cap in value.

If your contribution is over the limit. Gahmen will send back the extra at the end of finance year.
 

when this happen, it is a very good sign that you should start using the CPF money for other stuff like topping up for your parents CPF or getting a more expensive house liao.

maybe cos our banking sector is quite large, that's why there are so many who can afford the loans..just my wild thoughts

if they are willing to take the risk. why not?

initial year, they might be very kang kor. but after that, they might be able to fulfil their dream leh? you never know for this sort of things.
 

after all 10K per month translate to 8K take home. so remove 1 K will still have 7K. quite sufficent.

i use to know 3 of such cases.
 

both are the wife of my friends, 2 in stanchart, 1 in uob.
 

esssentially if i didn't remember wrongly, the rate is something like 0.4% interest rate throughout the loan.  this is staff rate loan only given to employee of bank and is not subject to varying market conditions that swing the rate up or down.
 

0.4% interest rate is really very very low.

For those who plan to buy $1mil property to stay to consider.

Investment $1mil, funded by cash, cpf and loan.

Weighted ave. Cost of capital = 3% (lets say)

Annual cost = $30,000

If combined income = $100k, it is 30% of your income. 

Yet to add in maintenance charge ($5k-6k) and property tax ($1k)

Worth it or not?

No wonder we are so stress! Need to maximize our every minutes at work and on the road.

if the interest rate shoots up,
 

many people (I guess), won't be able to take the high loan repayments man....
 





 
 

I've mentioned this too at another thread just to remind people with short memory.
 

Not only rise in interest rates will kill you; retrenchments; illness; recession; new govt policies, etc will.
 

My guess is in the medium term there will be a lot of red blood flowing due to excessive speculation, greed and miscalculation in the current market.
 

I pity those families losing their homes in the future caused by buying high now.

wife works in a bank
 

for the properties we bought, none of it were taken with her bank; from what she said, staff rates aren't the best around. 
 

If i'm the big boss, I also wouldn't want my staff to take staff loan. I risk them defaulting on payments should I decide to sack them; else I just have to keep them no matter how screwed up their performance is.

affordability is relative lah. for the typical upper well-to-do person, a $3M property may unaffordable. but $1M is a steal. for a HDB upgrader, $1M is definitely within buying range.



 
 

Bro, typical upper well to do person , why $3mil unaffordable?
 

Thought typical upper well to do should be able to down $1.5mil and loan $3mil to buy $5mil property.

For whatever reason, we have been inculcated with the idea that owning your own property is good.  What's wrong with renting anyway?
 

This is my conspiracy theory.
 

This started when the CPF scheme was launched.  The nation needed seed capital to start up may industries to create jobs and what better way than to utilise 40% of the national wages to do it.  More GLCs set up, more jobs, more CPF contribution, more seed capital, it just keeps snowballing.  Goh Keng Swee was a genius!
 

Then it became apparant that people will be retiring rich with lots and lots of money whom they will pass on to the next generation.  That is no good to the country as the younger generation will be flushed with money and has little reason to work hard.
 

Something has to be done to reduce the vast amounts of CPF money people will retire with.  Then the HDB was formed and the rest is history.
 

Like I said, Goh Keng Swee is a genius and I mean it!

this i agree.
 

i have been hearing very cliche reasons for owning instead of renting property.  ie instalment services your own property ownership while rental income services other's property ownership which the former eventually means you own a property while the latter don't bring you to the status of house owner.
 

but is rather superficial because they don't even analyse cost of interest. these people have been brainwashed to think that house ownership beats renting house any time.
 

a 30 year tenure loan incurs hefty interest which can come up to 50% of the the principal amount loan.  if there is no capital appreciation, there is no advantage to owning one especially where rental rates are still quite reasonable in singapore.  if you rent, you are not exposed to the interest cost as well as possible depreciation.

bro i think i post this in another thread.

I give you 2 situation, you chose which one is better.
 

Given both situation in the same place say boon lay.
 

1) You buy a 3 room at $250K. loan around S$800.00 per month for 30 years.
 

2) you rent the same 3 room at $1400.00 per month. for 1 year. 1 year later you might or might not need to change house to rent.

in singapore, if you are committed to stay here, confirm better buy one.
 

if context is elsewhere like USA etc.... then it will be different.

Tax laws are different, mentality of the market also diff. 

then perhaps rent is better.

ah... you are talking about double compound interest of CPF and Bank Loan.
 

That is where you did not see the clear picture. do note that if you make a correct calculation and you have enough min money in your cpf when the time come. the so called CPF interest become invalid anymore. (i called HDB to clarify a while back on this as my father 58yo was thinking of selling his flat.) so basically you just need to have min sum or the amount you paid in CPF plus interest (which ever is lower) if you are selling the house after 55 years old.
 

if you sell earlier than that. its even better. you pay lesser CPF interest.

I think the question here is, which is better? paying Rent in cash or paying loan in CPF.
 

For me, my assessment is base on the fact that my retirement fund should never be rely on the ever changing CPF but from cold hard cash been saved by myself.

i think i give 2 example easier.
 

1) after 55 yo assuming min sum is 150K  (going to assume min re-drawer date to be 55 yo.)

sell house at 300K. (all loan some how paid.)

current CPF got 55K

used CPF on house say 150K and interest incure say 30K.
 

by tight you should repay 180K so left with 120K.
 

but since CPF already got 55K and min sum is 150 K. only pay 95K. so left with say 205K.
 
 

2) but if lower than 55 yo you pay 180K. but you get to redraw that amount again at re-drawer date.

acutally i base on the fact that CPF interest rate you have to return when you sell the house is still part of the money. you just got more of your profit from selling the house locked up in the CPF. if you make a loss. you dont have to top up anyway.

actually to me no issue on hit before hit 30 years or not cause ultimately those so called CPF interested, you will still be able to get back in cash on redrawer age. just that its no longer a compound interested from gahmen but from my own pocket.
 

very much like taking a loan from own endowment plan.

put it this way.
 

i can understand how many people feel
 

use cash to service rent, end up no cash.
 

cpf is dead wood in their eye, use to service loan and save up the cash is better deal.
 

i can understand this mentality that's why i think our govt policy pushed people to behave in this way.  obviously there's also vested interest in the govt drafting the policy this way.
 

also i can understand the inconvenience of being made to move regularly by landlord who change their mind about renting if one rents.  pay a little bit more for convenience i can agree.  
 

but i also remember how many people were burnt by property ownership during 2000-2005.  hence my view is people should still do their sums, instead of relying on standard reasoning like "buying is always better because the loan services your own property while rent services other property".  In the complicated world today, it is not a certainty that buying is always better.

This is another point where we should be thankful to our greatest govt.

Our HDB load interest is only 2.6%.

So, surely I will keep my cash and invest it in stock or others to generate 4% or even 10% return.

Something like, if I have $300k cash, I can buy a 4rm hdb in cash or, down $100k and loan $200k @2.6% interest. But I have invest my $200k for a return of 4%. I will have passive income of 1.4% from $200k.

If the cost of loan is 8-10%, back to he level in the 80s, we will have to reconsider our strategy.

haha.. i think because we are talking at different thing lah.
 

you refering to pay flat in full as compare to pay via loan right??
 

i also tell my friend before, you pay flat in full (he do that in 5 years by topping up), your CPF interest of 2.5% is increasing every year while by more than the 2.6% loan he is paying on the long run. did a spread sheet before on this

no money to eat liao still worry whether at the mercy of others?  Debate here is not whether owning is better than renting but renting as an option.  The moment people start realizing that renting is ok, property market will cool, prices will come down.  People here are still driven by this irrational need to own their own property despite ridiculous prices!

This is another point where we should be thankful to our greatest govt.

Our HDB load interest is only 2.6%.

So, surely I will keep my cash and invest it in stock or others to generate 4% or even 10% return.

Something like, if I have $300k cash, I can buy a 4rm hdb in cash or, down $100k and loan $200k @2.6% interest. But I have invest my $200k for a return of 4%. I will have passive income of 1.4% from $200k.

If the cost of loan is 8-10%, back to he level in the 80s, we will have to reconsider our strategy.

Saving Ac 2-3%

12m FD 5-6% late 70s-early 80 as high as 10%
 

Now, saving only 0.1%. Might as well don't give.

12m FD also less than 1%.
 

So, why are we richer? Because the govt continues to print money to fuel the economy.

just imagine if interest rate stays at long term average of 3%, a 800k loan over 30 years would incurr interest cost of 414k!  i bet those stooges never consider this
 

of course, interest rate is not 3% now some may argue.  but it was 3% for a long time and even 4-5% was attained too

put it this way.
 

i can understand how many people feel
 

use cash to service rent, end up no cash.
 

cpf is dead wood in their eye, use to service loan and save up the cash is better deal.
 

i can understand this mentality that's why i think our govt policy pushed people to behave in this way.  obviously there's also vested interest in the govt drafting the policy this way.
 

also i can understand the inconvenience of being made to move regularly by landlord who change their mind about renting if one rents.  pay a little bit more for convenience i can agree.  
 

but i also remember how many people were burnt by property ownership during 2000-2005.  hence my view is people should still do their sums, instead of relying on standard reasoning like "buying is always better because the loan services your own property while rent services other property".  In the complicated world today, it is not a certainty that buying is always better.



 

I think the question here is posed after people have done their sums.

If one cant afford to buy, then confirm dont even think about buying.

Just throw the idea out.  cannot afford to buy, still want to buy? thats financial suicide.
 

The debate is : if one can afford to buy, then why rent?

remember this is singapore context we are discussing.

the problem is the definition of affordability varies from person to person for them to justify their purchase.
 

some ministar says as long as the monthly instalment is affordable, pay through 30 years loan is still considered affordable.
 

i don't call that affordable because job is not definitely going to stay with one throughout the 30 years.

rent or buy?
 

very subjective issue, it depends on needs and wants of a person and which stage of life.
 

and Singapore is a very funny place when come to property, because we have a different system, The CPF!!!
 

most ppl buy because of CPF, as installments are service by CPF, no actual cash is seen, thus no pain. what we do need is of course cash for down payment and whatever fee.
 

in most big countries, even MY, most ppl buy real estate for investment and not for staying, renting out to cover the installment payments and cash in on capital gain when price moved up, that is why location location and location is important!!!
 

that is one of the reasons, renting is very cheap over in other places. and it make sense to rent.
 
 

but here it is very different..............................
 

here mana ada location?   anywhere no good, our bosses make until no horse run, from nobody want to highest priced!!! here closed eye and buy anywhere also same same............than ppl rent out because they want passive income, not only to cover installment but to make $$$ some more, so how can rental be cheap.
 

ppl talk about interest pay over the years and so on, against renting and saving the interest for investment to gain. that is ang mo!!!
 

housing loans will always have the lowest interest rate, if housing loans increase rate, other loans will cost more. 
 

if you pay cash for installment and cash for rental, than keeping the down payment for investment and rent make sense, because you may get capital gain, but, investment being investment, are we able to get 6% compound interest like the ang mo teach us?  I say no chance!!!
 

here buying is not paying hard cash, and we pay very low interest for housing loans........since we are on $1M housing, quote example.
 

we buy a house $1M, pay 30 year, assuming we take full loan at 2% fix throughout the 30 years (very unlikely case).
 

at the end of the 30 years we would have pay $1.6M for the house including interest. and let say no movement  in price and we sell the house at $1M ( not taking inflation in account) did we lost 600k in interest?
 

No, we rented the house for 30 years, at $1600 a month with no rental increase for 30 years, without having to move house.
 

assuming we get some capital gain due to inflation and we get to sell the house at $1.6M after 30 years, did we not make any profit?
 

again No, we stayed in the house for 30 years.......................free!!!....................no rental, because what we paid, we got them all back.

Unfortunately not everyone is as financially prudent as much as we hope they will be.  If not, how we explain the upward spiralling of HDB prices???  We have been told too may times that buying is good, renting is bad regardless of affordabiltiy.
 

The way I see it, we have potentially another mini singapore flavoured subprime crisis in the making!

Yes, that is indeed a problem. I see yourpoint
 

there is no scientific formula but there is a certain comfort level of affordability which every responsible individual can take.  anyway, if an individual feels that he cannot really afford and yet still continues to buy instead of rent, then he is simply stepping into quicksand.

for me...buy or rent depend on if I can afford as well as how much property price will increase....for a 30 yrs loan....the interest probably would be at least 100% of the loan amount...so if we rent 80% on a said 100k hse...eventually with interest...we would need to pay at least 180k for the hse....and yes it is at least......so will the 100k hse i buy now be worth 180k at least in 30 yrs ??? if yes...I got free stay for 30 yrs...extra will be for fighting inflation....if inflation is 5% a year....how much would a property need to appreciate in order to fight inflation and to somehow still make some money ???

Property appreciation is 1 main contributor to inflation.

In Singapore, we were told the land is limited and it will not grow. But the population can still grow if there are jobs available.

So, the property price will only goes up in long term.

We all buy this theory and therefore, we all rather buy instead of rent, in the hope that property price will go up in the future.

To the point that we forgot, there is an option call rent, short term rent.

i didn't know about the "returning part of CPF" when one sells the house, having downpay and service the loan via CPF....
 

where one has to return the amount mentioned above, as well as the interest one might have earned when one serviced the home loan....
 

this is utter nonsense man....
 


 

it's like cash rebate for cars not too long ago on car loans....
 

bank entices "cash" to clear your old car loan,
 

then when you decide to sell before the minimum loan period,
 

you gotta pay a penalty and pay them back the rebate....
 

utter nonsense....
 

same thing applied to housing loan,
 

but housing loan much more money and longer tenure....

At the end of the day, I look at my property purchases as some kind of forced savings.
 

At least for now, I know that no matter what, the roof over my family's head is secure.



 
 

The roof is secure only if it is fully paid up. If one were to buy now when prices are at historical highs and take a loan of 80% for 30 years, there is a real risk of him facing a finacial crisis or recession of some sort in the next 30 years. These type of shocks are unpredictable and the cycle has gone down so much that one is to expect a shock of some kind every 7 to 10 years.
 

My point is, in the above scenario if the loan is with a commercial bank and the interest goes up to 4% or more. Many of these people will be big trouble even if we factor in the unlikely scenario that the price remains the same. Many are taking large loans that are curently below 2% and have not factored on the impact of interest rate hikes. 
 

Simplistic rough calculation: 

Imagine a loan of $1M at 1.5% for 30 years. The monthly repayment will be $4028/-. If interest goes up to 3.5% the monthly repayment goes up to S$5694/-. If it is 5% the repayment will be S$6944/-. Mind you 5% is not even the highest we have seen.............
 

Another potential problem is the impact if prices of the properties start to crash.  Even a crash of 20% is sufficient to have the banks start calling on the owners to top up. This is the MOST scary scenario..........
 

This "risk" which used to be confined to the domain of private property has now encroached into public housing due to the high prices and more prevalent commercial loans.

nothing beats having "ownership" and freedom and "one's own turf"....
 

if you rent, the landlord may chase you out at any time....

(especially so when you don't foot your rent, or when there's a queue of other's willing to pay more for the rental than what you're paying currently)
 

end up you live like a convict liddat....
 


 

but it's more financially viable than owning a house....
 

especially when one just started working and wants to start a family....

Yeah, am planning to get married soon and was looking at the EC at senkang/punggol. 
 

My initial expectation was that the smallest-smaller unit would probably start at 450-500k which is what I'm looking

at. Abit stretch budget but still maintainable. Had that impression in mind becase of the multitude of 

flyers promoting condominiums at prices starting from 450k to 550k. So HDB EC cannot be more ex than pte

condo what, right? Boy was I wrong......
 

Seriously...wth is HDB doing, providing homes for Singaporeans or squeezing every last penny out from

honest working Singaporeans trying to set up a family...And they have the cheek to run 'cupid programmes'...
 

Will not be getting it now obviously....waaay over budget, don't wanna get caught in the property trap.......and disgusted at HDB for their total loss of vision.
 

Apologies if I sound gripy to you, just that utterly dissapointed at how things turn out personally. 
 
 

Guess I'll just have to wait 5-10yrs for the bubble to burst. Or earn as much as possible and get a nice MY passport and a 

nice and cheap LANDED in MY for RM250k!!
 
 

P.S. Hope the new batch of ECs 5% application and 2% occupancy.

How can the interest rate be lower than that of the cost of borrowing money between banks? Sibor 3 month rate is already 0.56 as of today. 
 

Typically at the banks, there'll be slightly lower admin costs and you can make additional payments without penalties. 
 

Not sure about local banks, for foreign banks the staff rate applies for all confirmed permanent staff. 
 

However, if you get retrenched by the bank, your loan will be terminated and cannot be converted to commercial loan rates. 
 
 




i use to know 3 of such cases.
 

both are the wife of my friends, 2 in stanchart, 1 in uob.
 

esssentially if i didn't remember wrongly, the rate is something like 0.4% interest rate throughout the loan.  this is staff rate loan only given to employee of bank and is not subject to varying market conditions that swing the rate up or down.
 

0.4% interest rate is really very very low.

There are a lot of FTs in the banking sector (foreign banks) as compared with the locals in the sector. 
 




guys, have you guys heard that bank employees get preferential loan rates like 1% or lesser, as long as you are still working for them? qualification: I learnt this while talking to a reservist guy during our ICT and he's a bank employee who bought a condo..
 

maybe cos our banking sector is quite large, that's why there are so many who can afford the loans..just my wild thoughts

Haiz...yeah, was actually weighing the resale value 12 years down the road. Was considering a 4-rm vs ec. 
 

4-rm today: $450k with reno 

ec today: $700-800k with reno
 

projected 4 rm 12 years later: $650-750k 

projected ec 12 years later: $1.1-1.4m
 

That's provided the bubble don't burst lah...
 
 

So hard time considering and crossing fingers hope bubble burst next year and got good deals from over committed FT 'house rent-ers' or bank fire-sales...
 

Not that I'm hoping pple will get into that kind of trouble lah, but if you kenna repossess for fs then you know you didn't factor in buffer and only can blame yourself.

It all depends on the risk you are willing to take and how much you want to leverage. 
 

My latest housing purchase is only 45% loan so it is very safe. No way the banks will call me to top up. Low risk but low rewards. Example if I was more gung ho on my previous puchase, I could be completely debt free now. During the 2004-2008, I had quite a fair bit of extra cash but I plow everything back into the housing loan which resulted me paying off my first housing purchase within 5 years. BUT if I had used those money for a downpayment of another unit, I would be in a much better condition. But that is with perfect hindsight....

Yap. 
 

Low risk, low returns.

High risk, high returns.
 

The problem with buying property now at high prices and taking large loan becomes : High risk, low returns.

well, i did not say the rate i quoted is absolutely current or correct.  i was giving an estimate of the figure they told me in the past.
 

it could be due to last time interbank borrowing is lower or that the figure in my memory was slightly off.
 

but i was quite sure it is 0.5 or below rather than above.

the return and top-up of CPF part,
 

is only useful when one retires after 65yrs....
 

but now when the garment don't want any retirement age,
 

work till we die,
 

how???
 

the money will be kept with them forever nia....



 

Technically your children will and can re-drew all CPF monie (minus the medic save portion) in full cash after you are burry 3 feet under (or burn till ashes).

So no, they dont kept the monie forever.

For information, these are the allocation % from your CPF contribution based on age.
 

35 and below,
 

OA (65.72%), SA (14.28%), MS (20%)
 

35-45yrs old,
 

OA (60.01%), SA (17.14%), MS (22.85%)
 

45-50yrs old,
 

OA (54.29%), SA (20%), MS (25.71%)
 

50-55yrs old,
 

OA (44.84%), SA (24.13%), MS (31.03%)
 

So if you are above 30yrs old and are planning to take a 30yr 80% loan, you may want to take note.

You missed out a very important info.

Ceiling at $4500 for both employee and employer.

If you earn $10k, your CPF OA is only 35% x 60% x $4500. Not 60% x $10k.

35% x 60% x 4500 = $945.

If wife also earn > $4500, total OA is $1890.

Max Loan for 30y term without using cash with:

Interest at 2% = $510k.

Interest at 3% = $450k.

Interest at 4% = $400k.
 

So, for those who buy >$1mil property, they either pay a good amount as down payment, or they use CPF + cash to service their million dollar loan.
 

Ok, for those who do receive >4months bonus, they could afford slightly bigger loan.

I thought it was already covered in the earlier posts mah so I didn't include.  
 

I just want ppl to know that as they age, their OA contribution also decreases.

wah, like that count, don't need to buy liao lor...................
 

but jokes a side, if we have to count down until that detail, than I think the house is not within reach......better don't bother.....
 

IMHO, be it a $500k, $1M or $10M house, buy only if we know that we can service it, even if something happens in a year or 2...................
 

of course it is good to have a $1M house, but than let's face it, if cannot than get something at a lower price lor, 70% of Singaporeans stay in HDB, what's the problem..................cannot buy now does not mean cannot buy later, nobody know what will happen tomorrow....................
 

so for the younger ones, don't stress yourself out too much, $1M EC penthouse cannot than look at smaller EC units say $700K, still cannot look at 5 $500K 5 room, still cannot look at $400k 4 room, buy 1 1st and try to upgrade later, at least you get a home of your own, as you grow and income increase (hopefully), than trade up.
 

I did that, buy  4 room from HDB, so far out of the way, but bare with it for 5 years, sold for close to 100K profit after 5 years, move to resale 5 rm near parents, pour back all the profit into reno, than stay for 6 years, sell for $130K profit and move to resale EC (smaller unit, don't know is upgrade or downgrade ) now is paper profit $120K, don't know what to do liao............
 

took me some time but what the heck I still get there mah, slower only mah...................

Yes, that is indeed a problem. I see yourpoint
 

there is no scientific formula but there is a certain comfort level of affordability which every responsible individual can take.  anyway, if an individual feels that he cannot really afford and yet still continues to buy instead of rent, then he is simply stepping into quicksand.



 

Rent have to pay cash. 
 

Likelihood exceed installment amt also. 
 

Buy can use CPF. 
 

Less cash outlay + can own the place.

mine is 125 sq m resale 5 rooms, living with my parents and 2 other siblings with a maid....
 

am thinking,
 

this will probably be the house i'll live in till i die, seeing all the exhorbitant housing prices....
 

may do some renovation in the living room to 'increase' the living room space, since my living room is shaped L....and probably air-condition the living room as well....
 

many of those living in same unit, but different floors have already done so (bar the air-conditioning)....
 

and am glad mine doesn't have that stupid bomb shelter,
 

and has 4 different rooms (actually more like 3+1), since 3 bedrooms have parquet flooring,
 

the additional study room has build in doors, but floor tiles only nia....

Buy a 2 rm apartment and you and your wife and daughters move out.

Must find nearby so that can send your princess to your parents.

Of course, 2rm private apartment now also easily $400k or more.  
 

Actually, my case same  as you. 4rm hdb with my parents and my sis. I have 2 boys. So, we moved to private apartment out of no other choice as my name already used for the hdb. Cannot buy 2nd hdb. To sell existing 4rm hdb to free up my name? Cannot as I was sitting on huge paper loss. But anyway, now it turn out to be a good choice as the private apartment price went up faster then hdb. Count our blessing.

Bro, 4A and 5I no diff in space, but price alot of diff...........................
 

so 4A is need, 5I is want ( same same 3 bedroom only).....................
 

EA is different, EA has 4 bedroom, 5A has bigger space, but also 3 bedroom, unless you do some re-work and create another room.................
 

so your case is you need 4 bedroom, 4A, 5I all cannot meet your needs, EC not many come with 4 bedroom, have also above $1M. 
 

the other way is of course EA or the biggest 5A you can find and block up another room.......
 

all this I thought of before, before I bought my EC, I also did look at EA, but $500K for a HDB flat (although got 4 bedrooms) in Jurong area against $630K, I went for the later, don't know right or wrong, but till now no regrets yet.
 
 

the other option is tell your brother to sleep in the hall lor, than your girls can have the room, your brother will somehow moved out and buy his own flat later i think (unless his a lot younger). by than you will than be left with a extra room.

Sibor rate is at the lowest since April, so your assumption that the rate is lower in the past does not stand.  
 

For foreign bank, the loan interest rate is unlikely to be lower than Sibor rate, ie this is first hand information.  
 

For local bank, it is even more unlikely as they are not as generous unless it is part of the compensation plan agreed between the employee and the bank.
 
 




well, i did not say the rate i quoted is absolutely current or correct.  i was giving an estimate of the figure they told me in the past.
 

it could be due to last time interbank borrowing is lower or that the figure in my memory was slightly off.
 

but i was quite sure it is 0.5 or below rather than above.

yeah, i know sibor rate is lowest since then.  but there is a fallacious assumption you made that sibor is the defacto cost of borrowing.
 

for a net borrowing bank, yes, that is the cost.
 

for a net lending bank, that is in fact just a "selling price" of the goods they sold.
 

and there are some companies that does give employee benefits that eat into their cost.  why is it so impossible for banks to give loans that adds up to their cost if they know is just a small % of HR cost?
 

i am also a little amazed why you are so motivated to prove the point about the rate I quoted being wrong when at the onset I qualify it was an estimate. my folly was I did try to narrow down the estimate but it was not one which changed the entire substance of the point of banking employee borrower enjoying substantially better rates than normal borrower.

To me, providing accurate information to other pple is very important, unlike many forumers here who don't bother to verify or check whether the information that they provided is accurate.  
 

For home loans, the cost is not a small sum, and can eat into the P&L if the bank is big with many employees.  My point is that it is impossible to have such loan scheme with all employees but could be possible with selective employees where it is taken as part of the comp plan. 
 

If you don't buy my points, it's ok.  I've given first hand information rather than hearing from other pple.

and there are some companies that does give employee benefits that eat into their cost.  why is it so impossible for banks to give loans that adds up to their cost if they know is just a small % of HR cost?
 

i am also a little amazed why you are so motivated to prove the point about the rate I quoted being wrong when at the onset I qualify it was an estimate. my folly was I did try to narrow down the estimate but it was not one which changed the entire substance of the point of banking employee borrower enjoying substantially better rates than normal borrower.

new HDB no more 4A or 5I such terminology....
 

it's all standard size....one size fits all kinda thing....
 

my 5I has 4 rooms and 1 living room, hence 5-room HDB....
 

5A is much bigger, since it has bigger living room area....
 

the rooms are still of the same size....

i know it is costly, but if you read, i have never taken the stand it is extended to all people.
 

for me internet discussion is good to have precise information, but providing information that are substantially correct is better than no information at all.  so if i have to choose between precise information (but difficult to obtain), no information (because cannot obtain precise information) or substantially correct information, it is most beneficial to take the 3rd way of thinking.
 

for me internet discussion is not a workplace, if i write with "caveat emptor", reader will also be mature enough to know some information are estimates but the gist of the discussion is still valid.

it's not wise lah....
 

let's say you married at 30yrs....
 

say you have 10yrs prior working experience....
 

only to dump all your CPF into your house as downpayment....
 

then still have to take loan....
 

every month your CPF will be exhausted in the house loan....
 

then you'll still have to put back the money into your CPF when you sell your house....
 

and ensure you have a minimum sum in your CPF when you reach 55yrs....
 

and who can guarantee a job for 20-30yrs with increment in salary???
 

most of the time, your peak is when you're 40yrs....
 

after that, you'll most likely face a reduction in your salary (if you're doing the same thing for so many years),
 

or retrenchment when you reach 50yrs since the salary you command isn't viable to the company hiring you....
 

(speaking in terms of employee)....

This is another point where we should be thankful to our greatest govt.

Our HDB load interest is only 2.6%.

So, surely I will keep my cash and invest it in stock or others to generate 4% or even 10% return.

Something like, if I have $300k cash, I can buy a 4rm hdb in cash or, down $100k and loan $200k @2.6% interest. But I have invest my $200k for a return of 4%. I will have passive income of 1.4% from $200k.

If the cost of loan is 8-10%, back to he level in the 80s, we will have to reconsider our strategy.



 

You are right. But someone who is financially sound like yourself is like 5% of the population?

From a Govt policy point of view, the important aspect is the masses.

More than half of the population is educated, but not financially.

They are still sticking to the traditional wisdom to save and save, don't trust others with your money, only buy insurance (get whole life, endowment, etc).

With these old mentality, people (esp FTs) are profiting from them as these passive sheep are too sheltered, too weak, not hungry enough.

EC in Buangkok probably still cheaper...but may not be alot....current figures estimated by agent is 650k for the 742sqft 2 bedder which work out to be $876psf in NV Residence...if we assume 650k for the Buangkok EC for 829sqft 2 bedder...ok we don't take goverment grant of 30k into consideration...it will be $784psf....so the price difference is only 10%....there have been agents saying that base on history...EC should be 20% to 30% cheaper than private...should we base on 20%....the more realistic selling price of EC in Buangkok should be around $700psf...which make the 829sqft 2 bedder at below 600k....around 580k...but it don't seem to be the case now...

i use to think i must live in a huge house
 

but as i get older 

i realise i use very little space

most needed place is toilet, kitchen, living area, study room and bedroom
 

i dont need a game room, tv room, snooker room, swimming pool etc
 
 

being practical is important so that one does not need to stress on their finances and can use the money for quality living

rather than having to live on noodles 
 

it is been needs and wants

$784psf in Buangkok for EC?

My opinion.. Insane.
 

... Tells you quietly... Go to Changi side la. FH condo for only $800psf only. Just TOP.

If TOP a few years back, only $700-720psf.
 

The under construction one, Fully sold by developer. But resale market also only $820psf highest.

But maybe too far. Nobody wants.

10) living room, with Wii
 
 

Currently place not so many rooms so study room and guest room is combined.
 

I really think money spend on a large place is worth it as I am a very home person. I don't go out pubbing, etc. I also seldom go swimming or use amenities that my old condo provide. most of the time I am at home....

the clothes come out really crumpled and you have to iron them.

Young man, if you only fly once a year for holiday, I am sure your family will be more then happy to send you and pick you up.

???? what sort of logic is that? what goes up does not have to come down.... There is no cosmic law that makes prices comes down. 
 

Using your warped logic, I assume you expect sometime in your lifetime you will see landed terrace at $200k like 25 years ago. 
 

I am not saying it will  not come down but coming down is not a foregone conclusion as you make it out to be.

40K for toilet is quite okay if the person is installing suanna, Jacuzi and the likes bah.

the Housing Grant is a fixed amount for everybody...
 

every 1st timer couple even those who are eligible to buy EC can receive a 30k-40k grant from government.
 

30k for 1st timer

Additional 10k for staying near parents, within 2km if i am not mistaken..
 

there is another grant termed as Additional Housing Grant meant for combined household income less than 5k... also meant for 1st timer, that could amount to another additional 40k maximum, depending on salary.. 
 

so a couple could potentially receive up to 40k + 40k = 80k if they satisfy every criteria and are very low income earners...

I notice DBSS prices are at least 150k-200k higher than normal hdb flats in somewhat similar location for 5rm..actually if one were to buy a normal flat from hdb and then spend 80-100k on reno, would still have an apt that looks as good as those DBSS ones and overall still save 50-100k..the pricing of DBSS is imo a bit on the high side..

Think i must clarify, the reason i am going this path is not because i expect the market to drop soon, but rather because i dont want to be in a rush to buy my house. i want to ensure that i get something i like rather than compromised because of time constrant.

i dont mind the house going high or low. i want to make sure that the next house i get will be something that me and my wife like very much. (we are not particular about living near town of couse) hence i dont want to buy and sell together.

yes lah. The fact that you buy and sell together means that there is less risk involves but your potential profit is also much less.
 

For me, everyone NEEDs a property. The prudent way is to either upgrade or downgrade depending on which way you think the market is moving.
 

The risky way (high potential gains) is to either sell away ALL your properties or buy multiple properties with leverage.

That is certainly a smart move, wait for it to correct than buy your next hse. 



 

hdb is long term housing to provide roof over head.  selling now and waiting for prices to correct is akin to shorting, thus considered speculating.
 

one year ago, some sold, hoping to buy back cheaper, only to see it rocket even higher... only those that sold at the peak will win in this game.  how many can do so?  or more importantly, how many should NOT be doing so?!

No wrong to use cc to buy things. got points to earn plus some discounts.

Just make sure we settle the outstanding amount 100% every month.



 
 

no wrong. but harder to trace.
 

its not the big ticket item that is scary.
 

its the small ticket items that really push out the bills cause you did not remember how much you had spend.

I notice DBSS prices are at least 150k-200k higher than normal hdb flats in somewhat similar location for 5rm..actually if one were to buy a normal flat from hdb and then spend 80-100k on reno, would still have an apt that looks as good as those DBSS ones and overall still save 50-100k..the pricing of DBSS is imo a bit on the high side..




yup, u r right, that is why i don't understand it is still selling like hot cake  . furthermore, the extra 150k-200k also subject to stamp duty fee.

yes lah. The fact that you buy and sell together means that there is less risk involves but your potential profit is also much less.
 

For me, everyone NEEDs a property. The prudent way is to either upgrade or downgrade depending on which way you think the market is moving.
 

The risky way (high potential gains) is to either sell away ALL your properties or buy multiple properties with leverage.



 

Absolutely agree with this. The risk is there. Don't play play with only house. Especially not worth it since you can well afford it. 
 

If 1-2 years down the road, 

- the same house you sold then cost 50k-100k more. You will then buy or wait more?

- Even if it cost 50k lesser, will you then buy or wait for it to drop somemore? After admin fees, worth the $?

- If you miss the "low" window and the price surges, you will be priced out.

Ah gong gonna do something to ec Liao!!! 
 

http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/...scheme-20130426
 


There is "something wrong somewhere" with the Executive Condominium (EC) scheme, said National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan on Thursday, and the scheme cannot carry on in its current form. 

Speaking to 40 participants at an evening session of the Our Singapore Conversation (OSC) dialogue on housing, Mr Khaw said that there is "a sense of inequity" at the profit that EC buyers can make when reselling their units. First-time buyers of both ECs and Build-to-Order (BTO) flats get grants from Housing Board (HDB) to offset the price of their units, the size of which depends on their income.
 

But the "upside in the property market" gives EC-owners a far higher profit upon resale than the average three-room flat owner, noted Mr Khaw. This translates into "a sense of inequity, that the lower-income is getting less subsidy". This goes against the principle that HDB's subsidies should be progressive, and that the lower-income should get more, he said.
 

ECs are marketed and built by private developers, rather than HDB, and the income ceiling is $12,000, rather than $10,000 for a BTO flat. After 10 years, ECs become private property and can be sold to foreigners. Mr Khaw said that he hoped that "clarity and a conclusion" on how to tweak the EC scheme can be found through the ongoing OSC sessions on housing.

selling price 270k, no subsidy. Govt is doing nothing.

then they shld do wat they said, resale only to garmen at formulated price which wont boost up mass mkt condo prices nearby, then might as well go all d way n do 10yr MOP n no sublet. Y is garmen allowing a subsidized flat 2 b sublet? N yet they complain productivity is dangerously low? How abt making pple more desperate to work harder than relying on property as a main income means?

so assume dont know wat happened between 1998 n 2004? That was the period when job growth was negative, SARs etc. Some pple talk like it was so long ago n will never happen again. Probably not the same magnitude but same time period is entirely possible.

thats actually small compared to some biz men i know who lost anywhere frm $20M to hundred millions in 1998... inflation adjust that n its even higher..
 

some big players never came back... also that time was when many condos developers bankrupt too... guess who benefitted? the banks which seized their assets...
 

i know an old timer banker who until today say those developers deserved it coz during good times act damn lansi, showing off etc...

Depends whether you have any vested interest. Currently, I have sold my in late 2011 and have not vested interest in SG. So I hope not to curb the private market. This will allow is to burst sooner, so that I can re-enter the market again.

For EC pricing juz resigter your interest from the particular ec website, the best is make a trip down to the showroom and you'll have first hand available unit and pricing.

650 to 750 psf depending on size, location and facing.




Use to be near MRT EC priced at 750psf n rest location were 650-700psf.

Now everywhere 735psf, clearly see the price had gone up alot n its closing the gap or pushing the price between EC and PC. 
 

The grant probably make up of 30k? or a good 4% or about 40sqft cost and this may be just make up of the price increase different. But before MND decide to make changes, which we will not know, EC will still be the hottest topic.

Depends whether you have any vested interest. Currently, I have sold my in late 2011 and have not vested interest in SG. So I hope not to curb the private market. This will allow is to burst sooner, so that I can re-enter the market again.  




What if SG property is growing at a very slowwww.. rate and didn't correct? So far if u haven't sell your property in late 2011, it should be up by another 10% minimum now? Some more good pretty rental also.. 
 

How much has your other property portfolio in other country grown by?
 

some singaporean funny..Johor so big and so many cheap and nice house selling at rm 500k which is 12-20km from JB town.. All don't buy, all go buy a 50km non developed iskandar.. Singaporean Kanna CLOB once, now haven't learn.. In MY, policy risk is highest risk of all.

I have been enjoying between 12 to 14% of rental yield there. For the past 7 1/2 years, the rental ready cover my initial capital layout. Unless, for those who have bought within these 2 years, the real returns are either nowhere or negative. There are some developers even charge 20% or higher on properties, which are not even worth that much. Those who bought recently, are actually gaming for the next decade or 2. That's dangerous. So you right only for those who bought recently in Iskandar.  

In Singapore, where can you get here? Average of 2.5% or below?? Maybe negative, if you are bought high?

I think, there are some nice properties with lower $$$/sf around. Still can search. It is true, that the MY property price will continue to rocket. After 7+ years, I am shocked to see my first JB property appreciated almost 5 times of my initial cost.  
 

Those near KLCC luxury developments priced very affordable, range of 900k - 2 mil.

So who would win the case?
 



http://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/slw/index....;utm_medium=web 

First property dispute following cooling measures; "backdating" of option to purchase terrace house brings lawsuit 
 

A couple was prepared to pay $3.68 million for a corner terrace house after the introduction of the sixth round of property market cooling measures by the government. They say that the owner had agreed to "backdate" the Option to Purchase to before the implementation of the cooling measures.
 

However, the owner of the property denies agreeing to the "backdating", saying that she only found out about the relevant market cooling measures after signing the Option to Purchase. As "backdating" would be a breach of the regulations of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), she refused to complete the transaction, choosing to refund the deposit instead.
 

The couple noted that the bank valuation of the property was $4.5 million and that the owner had defaulted on the contract after she realised that she was selling at a low price and regretted her decision. They are thus insisting that the owner execute the Option to Purchase.
 

With the two sides unable to come to an agreement, the case has been submitted to the High Court. The buyers want the High Court to find the Option to Purchase effective, requiring that the property owner comply with the contract signed and pay compensation for other losses incurred by the buyers. The owner on the other hand has alleged that the buyer is filing the application with "unclean hands" and the application should be rejected by the High Court. The Option to Purchase should be cancelled and the caveat on the property lodged by the couple revoked.
 

This case is believed to be the first lawsuit resulting from the property market cooling measures and the Court's decision will have important significance. A hearing in chambers was held on 15 April but there was no decision. The date for the next hearing has not been fixed.
 

The three-storey terrace house is located at Jalan Angin Laut, close to the Simei MRT station. The freehold property has a land area of 424 square metres (approximately 4,564 square feet).
 

The buyers, Boon Lay Choo and Law Khim Huat, are represented by NLC Law Asia while the seller, Ting Siew May, is represented by M P Kanisan & Partners.
 

According to High Court information obtained by Lianhe Zaobao, the buyers were looking for a landed property to buy between July and October last year and received an Approval in Principle from UOB Bank for a loan.
 

On 5 or 6 of October last year, they found out from the media that MAS had launched a new round of cooling measures, limiting the repayment period for home loans involving private homes and HDB flats to 35 years.
 

In addition, should the loan exceed 30 years, the loan quantum would be significantly decreased. For loans that would only be paid off when the borrower is over the retirement age of 65, the maximum home loan and loan-to-value ratio would similarly be reduced.
 

Prior to 6 October, the couple would have been able to get a loan of 80% of the purchase price. After the new measures, they would only be able to get 60%. However, they say that they would still be able to afford the purchase even if the date of the transaction was changed to after the introduction of the measures.
 

Buyers: Can still afford the property even if the date was to be changed to after the introduction of measures
 

The buyers claim that they only agreed to backdate the transaction on the advice of an employee of the bank and with the agreement of the seller.
 

On 15 October, the buyers decided on buying the terrace house and signed an Option to Purchase, backdating the signing to "4 October". On 24 October, they received a lawyer's letter from the seller claiming that she did not wish to be involved in any "unlawful" acts and declining to execute the Option to Purchase while preparing to refund the deposit.
 

The buyers say that the seller changed her mind because she discovered that the terrace house could fetch a higher price after 13 October and that she had underpriced the property and not because she was worried about engaging in any "unlawful acts".
 

The buyers subsequently offered to change the dates on the Option to Purchase and loan documents to 13 October to avoid the so-called "unlawful acts" but the owner continued to refuse to execute the Option to Purchase.
 

The buyers had thought that if the owner had indeed been worried about "breaching the law", then changing the date would help dispel her concern. The owner still refused in the end, thereby indicating that she defaulted on the contract because she did not want to sell the property at a low price.
 

Owner: Decided to stop the transaction because buyers wanted to use legal loophole
 

In April last year, the owner told her son, Francis Jauw Kiat Sen, 29, that she wanted to sell the house. On 12 October, when she was in Indonesia with her son, her agent said that he found a buyer and that the terrace house could fetch $3.68 million.
 

She believed that $3.68 million was reasonable and agreed to sell the property at the price. The agent emailed the Option to Purchase and other related documents to her son the same day.
 

On 13 October, she signed the documents, which carried the date "4 October" and emailed them back to the agent.
 

She says she had never spoken to the agents for either side and did not agree to the backdating of the agreements. "There was no reason for me to agree to the backdating as doing so would not bring me any benefit."
 

On 15 October, when the buyer's son returned to Singapore, he asked the agent about the matter of the backdating. The agent said that this was to help the buyers get a loan and that many buyers did so and it would not cause any problems. The son had faith in the integrity of the agent and accepted the explanation.
 

On 17 October, Jauw banked in the cheque from the buyers and helped his mother look for another property. On 19 October, he heard from some other agents about the new property market cooling measures and told his mother that the buyers had backdated the documents mainly because the new measures limited the tenure of their loan.
 

The owner says that her son had said that doing so was illegal and had asked her to cancel the transaction. After she became aware that the buyers wanted to use a legal loophole, she decided to stop the transaction.
 

According to the prices for private property sold in the area between January and December last year collected by the son, the average selling price was $3.598 million.
 

Therefore, she rejects the allegation from the buyers that she had defaulted on the contract because she regretted selling at a low price, saying that $3.68 million was a reasonable price.
 

She says that the lawsuit from the buyers was vexatious and asked the Court to reject the application, cancel the Option to Purchase and revoke the caveat lodged on the property.

interesting. seller was already making double her money. the sellers have lodged a caveat on the place so i guess all waiting to see if court overturns it.

the problem is even with the backdating, the seller would have had to sign the OTP. doesnt that mean she was aware of the backdating? the CMs were all announced in the newspaper also. but i have a feeling court may overturn since they dont want people to play punk with the dates ...

1) Last time earn alot of money...Now no money so move to EC...

2) Parents sponsor alot alot of downpayment....
 

and ???



 

The answer: CPF.
 

Using an imaginary source of imaginary money to pay for the EC with a expensive price tag due to imaginary costs and imaginary luxuries. That's how you afford lor.

From Channel News Asia:
 

SINGAPORE: Unit sizes of private condominiums in Singapore are shrinking, according to research findings from property consultancy firm OrangeTee.
 

It showed that median floor areas of units in new developments were 93 square metres in the first quarter of this year, compared with 121 square metres three years ago.
 

Meanwhile, unit sizes of executive condominums have held steady.
 

Orange Tee said developers may be squeezing more units into private developments to maximise sales returns.
 

However, having more units in a development may put more pressure on facilities.
 

Christine Li, head of research and consultancy at OrangeTee, said: "In future, if these units are fully occupied, we do expect some overcrowding in maybe some of the common facilities. And maybe a lack of parking space, but I think it also depends on the mix of the development." 
 

Been looking at quite a few new condo's and they are just tiny but yet still boast 3 or 4 bedrooms.  But yet everyone is so eager to buy buy buy.  Going to be a lot of disappointed people over the next few years when their condo they bought off the plan gets delivered to them.

Heard from other forums that it's been happening for a while already. Most of the newer condos are mass market condos, so while you get the facilities, guards and gate, it's still gonna be like a sardine can. Sometimes, I feel that HDB also got advantage. No gate means anywhere can exit. Bad thing means any where also can enter, especially since one of my ex-neighbour borrow from ah long, got chased. Quite a few spray paints on his unit / area.
