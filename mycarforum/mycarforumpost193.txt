People themselves , make money by renting their flats. They happily keep quiet. When HDB profit from the people. People complain. 
 

So to be fair, I would sugget no renting out of HDB flats. And HDB should not profit from building. For PRs, they should only allow to sell back to HDB at their discount rate to the general market. This will finally bring price down substantially.   -_-
 

PS :Think I should bring this up, during the next grass root meet up.

Are you sure????
 

let see an example
 

duxton. 2004 1st ballot!! range $350k to $451k by end 2005 92% take up rate. not 100% due to race quata issue mainly.
 

2nd launch 2008 to 2009 there abt. $550k 
 

then there is still units left thus 2010 $600k and above.
 

last launch 22 units there abt left in 2012 guess the price?!?!?
 

go as high as $700k+
 

http://www.phpbbserver.com/phpbb/viewtopic...=pinnacleduxton

if HDB really people shelter shouldn't the release price from HDB maintain 

$350k-$451k since that was their "cost" then??
 

by moving "OLDER HDB" inline with property market isn't HDB setting the min. pricing for private property :)
 

HDB let go final Duxton at $750k, Tiong Baru and queentown see liao hmm... ok our resale should be $1mm then!!!
 

Private see HDB at SGD$1mm wow like that my private no way I go below $1.5mm..... so what property cooling measure??? HDB set the baseline of SG property.
 

who is the real benefits?? people who own 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 etc properties!! not 1 property owners.. so normally people who have 7 figures pay check owns lotsa property  
 

well that my opinion can be BS like I always say   dun quote me

People who make money from housing sales & rent keep quiet, people who need to buy new housing make the noice, mainly....I think. 
 

But all things considered, it is more important that people can afford housing (afterall, this is what promised when the government took away lands at a low price for public use). But now we are in a situation where there is no going back. Our economy will properly collapse if the properties value drop. 
 

Only thing Government can do is limit the price growth.

Rising property prices also reflects how well our economy is doing. 
 

If property prices falls drastically  probably means many ppl won't be able to afford a home too becoz of the poor economy.
 

Either way property prices are in a way expensive and not easy to afford. It will not or even going to be cheap, that's for sure.
 

Even though these are gov org I think it's important to make profit coz we cannot to rely on welfare. See country like Greece becoming in such a state. Let's say if HDB  is not able to sustain itself coz of negative or little profits dan in order for it to survive for the sake of sgporeans dan they will have to use taxpayers money to keep going. We do not want this.

Simple
 

give a breakdown of the land cost, building cost, and subsidy given by government

how much SLA bought the piece of land for in the 60s, and how much SLA is selling to HDB now for building the flat (do a valuation of the land cost adjusted for inflation)

will solve all the mystery once and for all

No leh Ngiam Tong Dow says chief valuer push up land price leh
 

Sadly, the clarity of thought shown by Dr Goh in pricing land was lacking in more recent years. Relying on the concept of opportunity cost, the Chief Valuer, at the behest of either the Ministry of National Development or the MTI (I am not sure which), valued land with Raffles Place land as the benchmark. The assumption is that every square metre of land in any part of Singapore has the potential to be Raffles Place.

main issue is the way they handle tender. No profit for HDB but large profit margin for Builder.
 

i think the tender for boat Taxi is a good reference.
 

for BTO, personally felt that they should do a backward calculation. 
 

1) Track which income group you are targetting at. (be practical, in mature town, dont expect low wages income.)

2) then cal how much they can afford base on loan to buy that flat and from there build up the whole selling cost.

3) factor in all the admin cost and wages for HDB.

4) Set the tender requirement and set a income ceiling bid.
 

The award the contract to the lowest bid that match the tender requirement.
 

HDB should build flat as bare as possiblem, for those beautiful garden, left it for the MP to do value added service and can help them gain some vote too. they can kill two bird in one stone.

assuming what you say is right.
 

if they think they cannot bid that price, then the have to do a open book with the government on the project with a set % of profit.
 

From there the HDB can decide on the next course of action.
 

this is after all a public housing project and not a private project. you cannot set the price of a hdb high till the basic income worker cannot afford it.

if you refering to HDB.

I think we all know HDB make loss is paper loss cause they also include their buying of land from land Authority which is stupid as the land belong to garhmen and HDB belong to government.
 

but on construction company, i agree we shouldnt make them loss money. so if you say no profit. so i suggest we go by open book lor.

Can you explain a little further, as I find it hard to understand. In other developed countries, where their Labor cost are much higher, material/construction cost probably higher (maybe, as they need design for sub zero Winter conditon as well as hot summer, like minimum wall insulation, double/triple glazed windows, hide/insulate pipes for sub zero condition to prevent pipes bursting etc), & yet can cost significantly less (out of the big cities anyway)!
 

Not to mention time cost when construction may need to halt for a period, say in harsh winter, & the ground is hard as rock. 
 

Either the other places are making losses, the way we do construction are not efficient. The money must go somewhere right. I am geniuely like to understand.

Yes good idea. 
 

I think hdb has big influence on property prices here n its abt time ty come down.
 

HDB sud only b fr citizens. All others incl PR sud buy private....till ty become citizens.....then ty can buy hdb.
 

And within certain period if ty wan to sell (maybe ty got better pr in another country  ) ty can only sell back to hdb at same price ty bought. No profit. Maybe even some deductions as handling charge.

In SG u must note many got a lot of money tied up in cpf n wud rather spend $300k of it now to buy flat then wait till age 65 to collect cpf minus abt $200k =$100k balance. Who knows by that time a small 2 bedroom hdb already too expensive then also cannot buy. Then stay where?
 

Also while waiting to collect cpf at age 65 pple need a place to stay n raise a family n most pple got very little or no more disposable income to rent or buy house.

actually I think HDB should privatized... 

can fill the coffers/reserves with money...
 

in it's current state it's just making people unhappy cos it claims to be subsidized public housing



 
 

HDB already one of e richest gharmen dept along wh LTA.

Construction can earn but not as much
 

They want to maintain their grade in order get more projects,so not all.projects always earn
 
 

My last project,the builder lost 4m....
 
 

For hdb,its is possible.they are losing,possible only la,minus land plus construction fee etc

yeah.. i agree on this.

no issue if they make their building pretty. but those amenities, dont need to do lah.. left it to the MP to score point isnt it better. 



 
 

This happen some years back when accounting system was changed n many cash rich gharmen dept had to dispose of their cash.
 

Many bought expensive land n built expensive buildings with expensive fittings to dispose of their cash but still retain its value.

U muz be joking for large margin for builder
 

U can make 25-30% from them or construction, u can as good as strike toto
 

Everytime i see gebiz award price,i wondering how these companies earn
 
 

Btw u talking about dbss?if  u sell me high land prie,will i sell low to others?



 
 

I think let us all agree on one thing. The main reason why HDB prices be it BTO or DBSS are so expensive is not because of the markups done by the construction company or HDB. It is due to the high reserve price set by the Chief Valuer due to some stupid logic.

that is why i say, if really cannot earn. then tell HDB and go for open book plus profit. 
 

then maybe we will be able to realise why the price is so high..  
 

if need to.. then government subsidary come in to press the price down when selling.

Base on this graph, is productivity from 1996 to 2000 better or there are more construction workers in Singapore during this period.
 

How come now only build so little with so many workers but still so slow?
 

Anyone from construction industry care to comment?

i never hint at anything hor..... dun want to get yellow card
 

just wondering what happen to cheaper better faster? this term come out post 2000 mah..
 

so many foreign workers now.. (compared to 1996-2000) how come still blame lack of workers?
 

Technology and building methods never improve in the last 10 years?
 

only difference i see is lesser thai construction worker compare to chinese and indian workers.
 

maybe thai workers are all superman. can built at 5 times the speed.
 

i dunno. i not in construction sector. just my own personal observation.

In SG u must note many got a lot of money tied up in cpf n wud rather spend $300k of it now to buy flat then wait till age 65 to collect cpf minus abt $200k =$100k balance. Who knows by that time a small 2 bedroom hdb already too expensive then also cannot buy. Then stay where?
 

Also while waiting to collect cpf at age 65 pple need a place to stay n raise a family n most pple got very little or no more disposable income to rent or buy house.



 

Not only to this. How about our children of the future?

People who make money from housing sales & rent keep quiet, people who need to buy new housing make the noice, mainly....I think. 
 

But all things considered, it is more important that people can afford housing (afterall, this is what promised when the government took away lands at a low price for public use). But now we are in a situation where there is no going back. Our economy will properly collapse if the properties value drop. 
 

Only thing Government can do is limit the price growth.



 

In fact, I'm seeing more moving to JB to stay, while renting out the flat. Funds are also flowing aggressively to JB recently. I an also see a early stage, shift in economic development towards JB. The danger is, if our germen not managing it properly, we will be seeing local asset prices head towards regression in the coming years. Factories and certain sectors' offices are shifting too. 
 

Those statements stand only if BN continue to rule.

That is a real concern. Gharmen still allow hdb prices to increase but offer some discounts like first timer n stay near parents to address pples fear most children cannot afford hdb when get married.
 

Unfortunately these discounts now even not enough.

Those discounts are not that cheap any more. This was due to the sky high property market that have resulted of today's asset prices. 
 

For example :

In 2000, got a flat at 280+k(5 room)

Currently, if one get a flat direct from HDB is about 550+k.
 

With just a span of 10 years difference. There's also a sharp raise of asset prices for the passed 6 years. Where got discount?

The only thing, I disagree with their policies are :
 

1. FT floodgate for the last 7 years. (Previously)

2. Social housing policy.

3. Public transport infrastructure. 

4. Public healthcare infrastructure

Yaa.. I don't any reasons for social housing as a investment tool. Though, I invest in private properties, I still stay in HDB. Private properties are meant for investment, but not social housing. This is under the expense of commoners' tax payers' $$$.

Are you sure????
 

let see an example
 

duxton. 2004 1st ballot!! range $350k to $451k by end 2005 92% take up rate. not 100% due to race quata issue mainly.
 

2nd launch 2008 to 2009 there abt. $550k 
 

then there is still units left thus 2010 $600k and above.
 

last launch 22 units there abt left in 2012 guess the price?!?!?
 

go as high as $700k+



 

classic example of how the govt screwed up the entire housing mkt

 UP for HDB!!!!! 
 

http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/...409-414528.html 
 



No delay to BTO timelines so far 

The Housing Board (HDB) is likely to be impacted by the tightening of the foreign-worker policy but there has been no delay to the construction timelines of Build-To-Order projects so far.
 

Minister for National Development Khaw Boon Wan said that HDB should be less affected as it uses prefabrication construction extensively. This helps to raise productivity and reduce on-site labour requirements, he added.
 

Currently, 60 to 70 per cent of the super-structure of HDB projects is constructed with precast components.
 

Mr Khaw said that the tightening of policy would affect the construction industry in two ways.
 

Firstly, in July this year, the man-year-entitlement (MYE) quota - which sets the total number of foreign workers a main contractor can hire based on the project's value - for new projects will be further reduced by 15 per cent.
 

This brings its cumulative reduction to 45 per cent since 2010.
 

Secondly, the foreign-worker levy, with the exception of that for higher- skilled workers employed within the MYE quota, will be increased in phases over 2014 and 2015.
 

These measures aim to steer the industry towards skills upgrading, mechanisation, and streamlining workflow to improve productivity and reduce reliance on foreign workers, Mr Khaw explained.
 

HDB will consider replacing contractors who are unable to proceed with work by allowing other contractors to take over with a new contract, he said.
 

It may also terminate the services of non-performing contractors and engage new ones to finish remaining work.
 

Mr Khaw stressed that "delivering flats to Singaporeans on time will remain our priority". He added that the impact of the latest manpower policies on construction costs will be clearer once HDB receives new tender bids.
 

It has not closed any building tenders since the announcement of the increase in foreign-worker levy, he said.
