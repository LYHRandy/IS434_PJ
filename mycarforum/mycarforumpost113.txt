Yo all,
 
got questions to ask about Bartley area. 
 
saw a condo there, its NOT Bartley Ridge or Residence. 
 
It's in Lor Ong Lye. Can walk to Bartley mrt in 7 mins or Serangoon MRT in 10-15mins. Maris Stella and PLMGS nearby
 
Anyone can advice about this area? Peak Traffic jam? Heat? Amenities?  What's the government future plan?

Bro, from the map, Lor Ong Lye is nearer to Upper Paya Lebar Road leh.... where got near Bartley MRT ?
 
Upper Paya Lebar Road is quite light traffic, during off-peak hours.
 
But still can walk to Bartley MRT thru those lanes (Lor How Sun), but I am not sure if it is 7 mins walk.
 
For makan, between How Sun Road & Quemoy Road there's a row of shophouses, with a kopitiam, and a popular prawn noodle shop. Got a Indian mama shop also.

I don't think can achieve within 7 mins from Lor Ong Lye to Bartley MRT. Ask the agent to walk with you and time it. 
 
It's more convenient if you walk to Serangoon MRT and take train down to Bartley MRT.

personally i go home like to have peace and quiet... 
 
look at the condition of the external walls of common compound .. recently painted or not? ask ur agent if she/he knows there will be more cash needed .. ask why previous owner want to sell? 
 
also.. check for parking lots... all these maybe one time small costs.. over a few yrs.. will accumulate

Back gate means walk by the quiet lanes of Lor How Sun to Bartley MRT. There are some slopes along the way. Not much shade. Also consider too if walking there at night time.....
 
The road construction along upper Paya Lebar is still on-going.
 
For makan, nearby blk 161 Hougang Street 11, got a kopitiam with nice zhi char and western food.

I believe 7 mins is possible too, provided if you walk at normal speed, on a flat pavement, without heavy baggage, and not under the hot sun.

yes, some residents told me abt the slope. But it seems ok. everyone walks to and fro, including school kids.  Guess i will go back and try it myself.
 
basically i need a decent public transportation (in case i don't drive anymore in future), wet market to buy fresh food, coffeshops for nearby makan and good school

 
bartley 7min possible...  most likely true.. 
 
serangoon?  不可能啦... too far... 

Yeah, Serangoon MRT will take 15 mins.  Agent v honest one.  
 
But it looks ok too coz u can cut through some HDB blocks. So got shade here and there.
 
I heard there is a small market in those HDB blocks?  The big market will be at NEX vinicity?

   you did your homework! do read some of the reviews abt the place in propertyguru... 
 
look at the timeline... 2010 painting works started... probably ended in 2011...   by 2012~2013 comments all said the maintenance not great... 
 
imho... pay not more than 880psf for the place... (assuming 3bdr)  and based on previous transacted pricing..

Try to get the agent to get you a copy of the latest AGM minutes or financial statements. Big ticket maintenance items like repainting, water-proofing, etc will cost quite a bit.
 
Don't be too happy if the maintenance fee is cheap, if the sinking and management funds are low, it can become a nightmare.

well.. theoretically, interest rates are at all time low.. only way is up... 
ie.. ppl start to be more willing to sell... price drops.. 
 
but this logic i hear for abt 4yrs liao... 
 
unique to sgp... election coming... p8p wld try to lower or at least suppress the prices to keep voting public happy...

I stay in between Tai Seng and Bartley MRT (10 minutes walk to either station, 5 mins by cycling). Staying near the circle line is already a plus point as you can switch to green, red, purple and in the near future the blue line.  Quiet place sleeping like a log at night and waken up by birds chirping. Not much amenities.... looking forward to the development of Bidadari.

Cherry Gardens?
 
I went to see quite a few there...... Evania, Dolce Vita, Tangerine Grove, Oasis Gardens.
 
Traffic from Kay Lee side is heavy. Traffic from Bendemeer is ok.
 
Short distance to NEX.
 
Eventually I bought Kovan.
 
 

 
i went to see evania too, but not the rest. Evania was so near the main road (Upp Paya Lebar Rd), and there is no visitor parking lots anywhere inside. Visitors have to park at HDB mscp 6 mins' walk away, plus cross the road, to get to the place. Now it is even nearer the main road, since the road is being widened.
 
So where did you buy at Kovan? 

 
 
Staying at Oasis Garden. U must be working along Joo Seng / Little Road?

 
I went to see OG too when the show flat was in the dunno what floor of the flatted factory too, but it was not suitable. 
 
Nope, i'm at the other side of the Upp Paya Lebar Rd.

Yo all,
 
got questions to ask about Bartley area. 
 
saw a condo there, its NOT Bartley Ridge or Residence. 
 
It's in Lor Ong Lye. Can walk to Bartley mrt in 7 mins or Serangoon MRT in 10-15mins. Maris Stella and PLMGS nearby
 
Anyone can advice about this area? Peak Traffic jam? Heat? Amenities?  What's the government future plan? 
 
 

 
Upp Paya Lebar Rd and Bartley Rd during peak hours traffic all quite bad. On Bartley Rd, morning peak, from CTE towards Paya Lebar when near Bartley MRT quite jammed. Then evening is the other direction.
 
On Upp Paya Lebar Rd, morning is heavy traffic towards paya lebar MRT direction. Evening is the other direction. Then on this road both ways got bus lane, which adds to heavy traffic… but road is widening near Evania, so should improve.

In this case, I'm fine with this kind of jam. I don't go to paya lebar area at all. I go towards farrer road in the morning
 
Where else can be as bad as farrer road morning and evening jam? Lol

I think i should also go recce a bit.  See if there are any good semi Ds on the top of the hill at how sun area.  
 
I like elevated ground.
Build a roof terrace can see the rest of the area.  Like sect master of some clan looking from the top of a peak, wahahahaha....

If you're going towards farrer road in the morning, then the stretch outside bartley MRT is not too bad. But beware, cos once you cross under Upp Serangoon Rd, that's when the jam will start, intermittently throughout till farrer rd. 
 
Should also stress that that area got not much eateries, but since you cook most of the time, should be ok. The only kopi shop at how sun keeps changing shops cos no biz… nearest place to find eating places will be NEX area, or the macpherson stretch or go toa payoh.

$460 for your Unit? ... How many sqft? ... How many Units in your Development ... Fairer way to calculate ...
 
Mine place is the same ... Very Small Pool ... Very Small Gym ... Very Small Play Ground ... Thats it ... Nothing Else ...

The maintenance at Evania is expensive because it is small development and it has guards. That's what is driving up the cost.
 
Seriously, look opposite at Tangerine Grove. The new Minton is also ok.
 
If you want peace and quietness, look at Kovan (not main road like Kovan Melody).......look at Poh Huat Road etc.  I moved there instead.

I don't own a condo. 
 
But i won't buy those small developments less than 100 units. I think it's natural tendency to get low balled when selling cos the transaction frequency for the development is low. Can be difficult to sell?

Not true lar..... depends on what price you bought :)
 
I like small development cause its easier to manage and everybody knows everyone.
 
I moved from a 45 unit to a 125 units development. Culture shock. Worse than ruffians, some of these buggers!

should be the other way round....
 
small development, won't get low balled coz sale of units is scare. Not many owners are selling.  Small development has the feel of exclusivity. People will like the privacy and quietness.
 
Big development, hundreds of owners are selling at same time. Buyers are spoilt for choices and they will low ball the sellers. its like cherry picking.

personally.. was repeatedly woken up on sat/sun by boisterous kids playing at the pool.... so.. small apartments with small pool suit my present lifestyle more. 
 
of cus.. if next time, lucky enough.. prolly wld shift again lo..

Hmm from my experience of selling and buying things online. not really. 
If ur market price is known (ie last transacted in your development), people will less likely lowball you. When your thing is "unique"/slightly different, that's when a lot of low ball offers will come into play. People will keep coming test water.
 
Different way of thinking i guess.

Depends. Small devt like Grand Duchess and Tierra Vue won't get lowballed.
 
I stayed in both small and big condos (common area wise).
 
As a kid, I prefer big compounds, a lot of space to run and make more friends compared to those small devt.
 
That's why that is one of my boxes to tick when I bought.
 
The other issue with small devt is parking. Friends visiting you will find it tough to find parking.

If your unit has a good facing, high floor, no west sun, away from noisy facilities...
 
Buyers will also offer their bids accordingly.

Anything below 100, I'm not keen.

Staying with/ near grandparents trumps condo anytime. I grew up with my grandparents around and I have to say it's something I appreciate, even more so now that I am older.

I don't think so ... I think the Management will only go on a first come first serve basis for 2nd cars ... Meaning to say, only when there are available lots, will they accept your fee of $150 for the lot ...  
 
This is normal especially those developments near town ... I went to see a few at Balestier, those are worst ... They don't even have a lot for every unit ... Because they know those buying these units are for Rental Purposes ... And most Tenants pay a premium to live near town so as to avoid driving ... 
 
Anyway, its is our responsibility to check before we buy. 
 
I used to live in a Development when at one time, they actually allowed me to park 5 Cars & 2 Motorbikes ... No Kidding ... After calculation ... My Maintenance Fee is cheaper than HDB ... Cos I got facilities some more ...
