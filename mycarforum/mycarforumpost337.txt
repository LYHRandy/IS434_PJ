Anyone has done that?
Any pros and cons?
 
I personally feel a bit uncomfortable with having a friend as my house agent... as somehow think not too good to have money dealings with close friends. but on the other hand, if i'm going to let some stranger earn my 1% commission, i might as well let my friend earn the 1%?

Better don't.
 
I bought a HDB flat through a friend as the agent.
 
There were some problems after we just moved in.
That friend/agent refused to rectify the issue after collecting the money.
 
We learnt our lesson.

What was the problem?
 
You need to understand that the agent's job is purely sourcing, sales and marketing and related paper work. And the money you pay him is just for that. Other issues, the agent is not liable to help. Those who help are just being nice. Those who don't are not wrong.

That friend was my post-graduate course senior who worked part-time as an ERA agent (secretly, as school policy doesn't allow scholars to moonlight). The scholarship was miserable and he had a family to feed.  Thus, he was hard-selling a HDB flat to me and would pester me while I was working in lab to tell me how bad his family situation was. Out of sympathy (and pestering), we finally decide to upgrade from 4-rm to a 5-rm flat in his listing, so that he could earn a commission.
 
He rushed us through the transaction.
 
When we moved in after renovation, there were loan shark vandalisms as well as bank debt collectors visiting our house.
 
We told him about this and he went into a very defensive mode.  What we wanted him to do was to call up the ex-house owner (as he had the contact) and we would talk to the ex-owner.
 
This, he refused to help.

i think it really depends on how well u know this friend and the degree of friendship u both have... i don't see there'll be any problem if u know in ur heart that this friend can be trusted.

I did that, with someone who used to be my insurance agent, and whom later decided to switch to property line. Knew him for 5-6 yrs and all along got along fine. Boy that was the biggest regret ever. Coz we agreed on a commission amount which was in line with mkt rates(most of my friends when they sold their flats with their agents, all pay only this rate). 
 
Then I went overseas to work and left the sale of my flat to this "friend" and my parents, and this "friend" had the cheek to email me to ask me if he closed the sale above a certain amount could he get another 0.5% in commission? The thing is that what I am paying him is already mkt rate, and he himself said that for me, he would be more than willing to sell my flat at the rate that we agreed in black and white, then when I am overseas and couldn't do anything, with my parents knowing little English, he came and ask for 0.5% more. This coming from a "friend" that I had known for 5-6yrs! I had to get his agency to step in and help me, coz when I suggested that I didn't have enough cash to pay the additional 0.5%(true coz I transferred all my funds away from S'pore) he had the cheek to suggest I pay by installments. Only when I told him I had referred this case to his agency and told him I would lodge a formal complaint against him if he insisted on the extra 0.5% that he grudgingly agreed to stick to the original rate. So after the sale of the flat, of course I no longer count him as my "friend" anymore.
 
So like what a lot of people would say, when it comes to things like money, you see the true colours of a lot of people, so I would say just speak to a few agents whom you have no personal relationship with and not let the friend handle the sale of your flat, so that when things go wrong you wouldn't feel bad when you have to bang table  .

More agents doesn't mean better because it is the same group of people, mainly agents reading the ads. 
 
Open listing agents are normally do not commit that much of time, money & effort to advertise your property. 
 
Last Saturday's property bulletin in the Straits times actually compared the pros & cons of exclusive & open listing.

What do u mean "upgrade.... in his listing" ?
I heard there is a thing call "signing an exclusive" with the housing agent, so that only he can sell the house. Is that what u mean?

In the first place, the problem lies with your friend's character. It doesn't matter if he is a friend or not. He will probably do the same if he is serving other buyers.
 
Frankly speaking, an agent will not know if the seller is wanted by loan shark or not. To be on the safe side, the buyer has to take his own initiative to check the surroundings and ask the neighbours.
This, he refused to help.
 
I'm also a property agent serving my friend as a buyer.  I'll do my best to help him find his house as I feel that it is not worth ruining our friendship on that few thousand dollars.

Was your mkt rate 1% for seller at that time? The recommended rate is actually 2% for seller.

My friend can be trusted, but the problem is.. he has just started working part time as a property agent.. and he has not gone thru the courses and not properly certified as an agent. So a lot of things he not sure, and I am sort of a guinea pig, as I will be his first customer.... Buying a house is a big commitment, and i am not really comfortable being a guinea pig... also, if the paperwork are not done properly, it might also result in legal issues?

for me, it was property agent turned friend. 
 
beyond call of duty is the type of service that i got from him, nice & unassuming.  frankly, this kind of agent hard to find cos most pple nowadays are kee2 koo kee2 only care abt their commission.

IMHO....friend responsible get best deal for you....no objection.
 
But if boh chup kind...I rather let stranger earn the commission.
 
Same applies for my insurance policy. Friend buy from them....10yrs also no see any calls to inform me of anything...
 
I buy from a stranger...he will call me every year to let me know the status...call to chit chat....even though its around 10mins a year....still better than my friend (even though I see him often....for coffee...never mentioned about my policy at all....in fact...I dun even know if he is still with GE Life or not !!)

i'm actually already actively sourcing for a flat myself.. thru newspaper and internet... and calling up seller agents to arrange for viewings myself. just need an agent to maybe help with the paperwork and procedures. i dun see how my friend as an inexperienced agent can value-add in sourcing for a flat.. think he would be doing the same thing as me.. search newspaper and internet to look for flat.. why would i want to pay 1% to another person to do something which i can do myself?

The question is not whether your 'friend' can act as your agent or not...you might as well ask this question in one thousand and one way like:
 
Can my friend act as my lawyer for some issues?
 
If you can exercsie good judgement and know where is the lines of professionalism drawn, then a friend might even be more advantageous in some respect!

Understand where are you coming from..... 
 
 I would fully agreed on the part that if the commission is to be made...must as well support a friend than someone you dunno....
 
 However if your friend is a rookie...are your prepare to accept some mistake if he made? that would voice down to how much trust you have towards his capability, which would frankly also happen to a stranger agent too...but you probably cannot scold your friend ..., in this case only thing that you should be sure is that your friend would not cheat you...all mistake would be an honest & genuine mistakes...and you would have to bear with it. 
 
 But if the friendship is not that great/close till you can bear with all these...or your the other half/party that involved would not prepare to be so kind...then better not...cos end up have a screw up deal plus lose a friend.....
 
 And if your friend is to blame you for this....guess the relationship is 
 
 Same happen to me each time need to buy cars (for my company/friends/relative)....cos I know quite quite a few friend in car company....those who angry with me if I don't refer to them...aren't my true friend....
