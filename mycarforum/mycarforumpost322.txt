SINGAPORE : Some 3,000 home hunters thronged showflats at Park Central@AMK on the first day of its launch on Wednesday. 
 
As of noon, 130 people have applied for the flats in central Singapore which will be ready in 2011. 
 
The project is Singapore's third condominium-style public housing, and a queue to view the showflats started forming at 5am. 
 
All 578 units at Park Central@AMK come with fittings like built-in wardrobes, air-conditioners and parquet flooring. 
 
The four 30-storey blocks will house four- and five-room units, priced between S$433,000 and S$689,000 or about S$500 per square foot. 
 
Real estate agents said the prices are comparable to those for resale public housing in the neighbourhood. These are about S$400,000 for a four-room flat and up to S$550,000 for a five-room unit. 
 
Despite a slight cooling off in the property sector, the project's developer expects a good take-up rate. 
 
Jackson Yap, CEO, United Engineers Limited, said: "This is the mass market, the demand is always there. The interest rate in Singapore is still relatively low so to speak, and the other one is cash flow. 
 
"If you do your sums right, the net cash flow for buying these units (is) not that high if you include your CPF contributions." 
 
Park Central@AMK is the third project under the Housing Board's "Design, Build and Sell Scheme", where the private sector is involved in the building and marketing of public housing. 
 
While prices at Park Central@AMK are nearly 10 per cent lower than the previous condo-style development, City View@Boon Keng, it is still too much for some - especially younger couples who have just joined the workforce. 
 
Kevin Kwan said: "Maybe you have to forfeit your car, not get it so fast; and for daily expenses, you have to be more meticulous." 
 
Others are worried about the falling value of their asset as well as tough times ahead. Lean Guan Hock said: "Now, due to the soaring oil prices, I think everybody must be very concerned." 
 
Even though many have put in an application for the flats, not all will end up buying one. Some applicants said their final purchase decision will depend on how the global economy and the property market perform in the next few months. 
 
Applications must be submitted by August 5, and sales will be done via a balloting system. - CNA/ms

The income ceiling cap at $8K, using CPF to pay still need to top up cash to pay the monthly installment. Worth it of not? 
 
If thinking of investment, with this buying price, dun think got a lot of potential to make money lor.

Yep, too expensive. Good going HDB, you've made public housing very "affordable" for the general population. Sell more flats at these kinda prices and in 5 years people will be living under MRT tracks.

Ppty market is showing signs of cooling down soon and likely there will be a big decline in 2009 and onwards. Not wise to purchase an over-priced project like this at a time where prices is still at one of the all time high and reaching a plateau. For those really looking to buy HDB, would suggest they shelve the plans for time being. not a good time to enter the market unless due to extreme urgency..

$400k for 4-room with just additional parquet flooring, air conditioning, custom fit wardrobes and prob kitchen.
 
Heck, even if I get a designer in to do up my new 4-room flat with marble floor, full customised carpentry for all rooms, parquet for bedrooms, new tiles for toilets, new air con unit, change all the windows, grilles, doors and maybe even add in all curtains also around $100k max only. Add on new 4-room flat price of $250k still got $50k change.
 
But of course, do they have $100k cash for renovation?  
 
$500 psf is ridiculous for a HDB pigeon hole.
 
I always advocate: first house don't bother too much as you do not know what you want. When you know what you want and how you live, then spend a little more on the 2nd house.

I choose not to go near these HDB high end projects. Esp the one at the boon keng. That was truly a mad pricing.
 
I would rather buy a condo with facilities....

What to do??? They care about making as much money as they can. I doubt the costs of building each unit houses exceeds 200k each and yet they are selling at twice or thrice the cost. Recently costs of HBD flats is ever increasing and very expensive till i feel its like a waste of money but lppl everyone needs a house.

My bro bought a resale condo (abt 1100 sq ft) at Grandeur 8 in june 2007 at 620K. The location is much better (only 7-8 mins walk to AMK hub)and its a condo! Although ppty price in june 07 had yet to reach the peak but it was already quite high..I dun see the point to buy a 5rm hdb flat for avg of 645k (taking median between the range of 600-690k) and at a lesser location. its not even anything within walking distance to AMK central.

$500 psf is ridiculous for a HDB pigeon hole.
 
All HDBs are pigeon holes......it only depends HOW the hole is shaped....L-shaped, V shaped or some irregular shape....but lately the pigeons have been less discerning about the shape and the size of their holes...they are only concerned about HOW other pigeons react when new holes are availiable and the locations of the holes!

but hor this case doesn't apply to such situations of 'urgency'..cos it will only be up in 3 yrs time! if tummy grows, most likely no choice but have to go to resale mkt..so for any urgent cases, I dun think this project will be anything within the list the consideration. in a nutshell, I dun see any good reason to buy this.

Yep very true. Moreover this project will only be done in 2011 or end-2010 at best. If by then (after this year's olympics and US presidential election) should economy had a downturn, these flats would have a lower market value then what they paid for it; effectively a loss. Factor in the first 5 years that they can't sell it, and the general economic cycle of 7-10 years; buyers would have to wait a good 15-20 years (2-cycles) before they would be able to sell their flats and break-even (factor in inflation too).
 
Moving away from an investment point of view, what irks me is that HDB prices are continuing to creep closer to market prices of private properties.  This really isn't what public housing is about. With the inevitable widening income gap, HDB should instead be mindful of the lower income bracket and provide sustainable housing for them. HDB seems to have become money-minded rather then people-minded... it seems they are no different from private developers.

Very expensive for a HDB and I'm not looking down on it.
 
Few factors to consider:
 
1) HDB is subsidised housing and they selling at this price means only one thing (not going to air it publicly)
 
2) Location sucks! Yes the location sucks and no offense to AMK residents. You pay so much to stay at a location where you have to pay to get in and out of the CBD notwithstanding you can take the MRT
 
3) Those fittings such as air con and wardrobe are just minor pawns to entice the buyers. Don't be taken in by them
 
I can't believe they are selling subsidised housing at near private apartment prices now

Only the older holes are shaped properly to max all floor area and mostly will get natural light and wind.
 
The new designs suck big time. What L shape or M shape. Poor design. Too many corners. Natural light does not bounce in. Wind can't flow through. Stay inside there for long also feel castaphobic. 
 
No offence to those Bros/Sis who bought these newly design flats hor.  Just stating what I feel. I know most of us have no choice but to choose these flats.

Its a matter of supply n demand, as long as flats that are priced at $500psf can still sell off within 6-12 months, its still considered viable - thus HDB will continue to build flats like these.

singaporeans always cannot resist temptation when they see something which look nice and they rush to buy without thinking carefully..for the fact that they can wait so long (3 yrs or more), it means the house is not needed so urgently..if not so urgent, why must buy this? they are other viable choices around or if not, can always wait. its precisely becos of this buying pattern and behaviour which led to hdb/developers confident of selling reasonably fast even at such high prices..

Iam not in favour of planning things in such a manner..it sounds more like planning for the house rather than planning for the marriage..and hor, buy new house direct from hdb must be worth it..if alr buy first hand at such sky high prices, how much can it go up anymore?? it seems more like buying a new flat but at resale price level..defeat the purpose..

The four 30-storey blocks will house four- and five-room units, priced between S$433,000 and S$689,000 or about S$500 per square foot.  

Will it sell?

 

let me share with you my recent encounter: 
 

1) one of my client wanted to sell his EA flat in the west, the flat is just about 8yrs old, they bought at $420K direct from HDB, 8 years now, market value there/ transacted price is around $450K. I get them to get CPF and HDB loan statement, guess what, is a negative sales, if he proceed to sell the flat now, they need to either write off near $120K CPF or top up with cash. 
 

2) Just yesterday, another client of mine, get the statements and calculated, their flat in the EAST just barely break even if there were to sell $50K above valuation. 
 

so what i am trying to tell here? If you think this is the good time to dispose off property to make handsome profit, sorry, you better look at how much you bought the property for previously. 
 

same senario happening now, the flat DBSS is costing from $433K, 5 yrs down the road when u wanna sell, u think can break even? think about it again...

Only during our parents generation they get handsome profits and those residents who bought when property market was super low like those residents who 1st stayed in punggol & sengkang...
 
Now HDB already reaping all the profits, juz design new flats nicer bit..look nice from outside but inside look like cubicle...the rooms in the new flat is so small,i tink my resale flat balcony looks bigger.

Maybe your mindset and mine are different from this current generation in their mid-20s. We belong to older generation liao.
 
I have a nephew, who had just graduated last year and he is already thinking about getting a car. I know for sure he won't be able to afford it himself.
 
Another male relative got a weekend car with the family's help and he is only in NS. The family is not rich, both parents are retired and were employees only. I don't know what they were thinking when they agree to buying the car for him. Damn stupid financial move if you ask me.

so the kids get to be this sort of spoiled attitude, and think the whole world owes them a living.

I believe the one you mention is suppose to be "selective en-bloc" of those BLK 240 ~ 250 units, construction is currently taking place. 
 

The Park Central is actually at the junction of AMK St 51 and AMK St 52.

The four 30-storey blocks will house four- and five-room units, priced between S$433,000 and S$689,000 or about S$500 per square foot.  

Will it sell?

 
 

As a rough guide, the nearest cluster of units which can be compared to Park Central would be those BLK 596 A/B/C/D, they are around 5 years old. It is separate from the Park Central by a school only, quite close to each other. 
 

HDB recent transaction price of those BLK 596s 4-room units are: 

 

BLK   / Floor        / Area   / Price       / Transaction Month                

596A / 21 to 25   / 91    / $485,000.00 / May-08  

596A / 11 to 15   / 90    / $481,800.00 / Apr-08  

596B / 01 to 05   / 93    / $450,000.00 / Apr-08  

596B / 21 to 25   / 90    / $480,000.00 / Mar-08  

596C / 21 to 25   / 90    / $488,800.00 / Jun-08  

596C / 21 to 25   / 90    / $485,000.00 / May-08  

596C / 01 to 05   / 93    / $447,000.00 / May-08  

596C / 11 to 15   / 90    / $450,000.00 / Mar-08  

596D / 01 to 05   / 85    / $423,000.00 / Jun-08 

 

I think quite close to Park Central pricing.

They give us a choice to choose which one we want. This is juz like a express BTO for us, want cheaper brand new flat and got time to wait, go and get the 5 yrs BTO, if want high class new flat and no much time to wait, take this 3 yrs express BTO.
 
 
I somehow agree. This is always the adgenda. If one wants fast, comfort and efficient. PAY!
 
From health care, public transport, housing and even NTUC Finest (not Fairprice hor), if one does not like to join the queue, PAY MORE. Else, keep quiet and join the masses.
 
On the other hand, all these indicate that there are demand. More ppl are willing to fork out $$ for those "premium" services; which is also a positive sign to our little economy. 
 
We can complain for all we want, the FT are seeing SG a magnet for growing wealth. Our property price is relatively cheaper than most part of Asia and they will buy a property for what they needed in the next 10 years.
 
Yeah...whether the economy slow down and the decline of property price are everyone guess. If one need a place to stay for a long long time, why bother if the price is up or down? Afterall, we all know that in 25 years time, the price will be much higher than today.

I supposed buying a "condo-like" apt is similar to people buying a "sports-like" car ... I mean can't afford a real sports car so next best thing fork out money but a regular car put sports rims, spoilers, stickers, change exhaust mufflers etc and now you have a "sports-like" car ...
 
So now HDB want to satisfy demand for people who wants to live condo lifesyle .. so next best thing HDB built a flat with air-con, parquet floor, built in wardrobe and put a BIG $$$$ on it and hey presto ... a condo-like HDB flat ... minus swimming pool, security guards, gym, tennis court etc...
 
My opinion : Buy resale 99 year condo or EC. It's more worth it. Just PM me and I'll email you a whole list.

My bro bought a resale condo (abt 1100 sq ft) at Grandeur 8 in june 2007 at 620K. The location is much better (only 7-8 mins walk to AMK hub)and its a condo! Although ppty price in june 07 had yet to reach the peak but it was already quite high..I dun see the point to buy a 5rm hdb flat for avg of 645k (taking median between the range of 600-690k) and at a lesser location. its not even anything within walking distance to AMK central.  
 
 
ah.. nice place.. but quite noisy with the MRT track.. 
 
I was considering the penthouse at quite an attractive price early last year as well

Yah, some was saying delay buying car, or spend less monthly. 
I am thinking, used up ALL your CPF is already wrong, fork out cash for monthly installment?  

 
yeah, and HDB requires you to use 100% of CPF ordinary account before you can take HDB loan... for most, CPF will be wiped out to pay for a subsidised flat. 
 
then when u have no money to retire, it's your fault again.

flats are getting more and more expensive these days.. Frankly, the location isn't the prime area and they are commanding such a high price.

your house also at super prime location ..also super high price  but worth the value coz the lift lobby also belongs to u. 

when i got mine, it was still consider affordable at $3##K, but now the price have gone up by another 140K after 2 years.

What I try to highlight is even more serious, the monthly installment must pay cash since no enough CPF to pay for monthly installment.

can send me the list + prices? 
 
I supposed buying a "condo-like" apt is similar to people buying a "sports-like" car ... I mean can't afford a real sports car so next best thing fork out money but a regular car put sports rims, spoilers, stickers, change exhaust mufflers etc and now you have a "sports-like" car ... 
So now HDB want to satisfy demand for people who wants to live condo lifesyle .. so next best thing HDB built a flat with air-con, parquet floor, built in wardrobe and put a BIG $$$$ on it and hey presto ... a condo-like HDB flat ... minus swimming pool, security guards, gym, tennis court etc...
 
My opinion : Buy resale 99 year condo or EC. It's more worth it. Just PM me and I'll email you a whole list.

I think the developers got no choice but to launch the project soon, because contract with HDB stated that the project must be completed within 48 months upon award. So developers cannot wait, unlike private property project.

Some qns
 
1. If one have $, can he/she buy a flat using his $ w/o loan and dun use CPF ?
 
2. If one have $ and able to buy a flat w/o loan. Will HDB give him lower priority to purchase the flat ? or over demand, include him/her in the balloting pool ?

I've also heard of sad cases where spoilt single kid get married, parents sell of their flat buy condo (under kid's name) and stay with kid & wife. When parents grow old the kid throw them in old folks home... 
 

that is one of the most stupid thing to do.One should have at least a roof to protect their head ..u neber knw wat can happen.That's probably the only asset old people should have. 
 

Even sell off flat also should keep $$ for retirement old age and not giving all to kids before they die.

I wouldn't call them stupid. I guess they just love their sons or daughters alot and think that it's all within the family. I'd rather call their children 'extremely unfilial' and maybe even inhumane. Anyone who had volunteered long enough in old folks homes would know quite a handful of these cases. Some children never even visit.

this brought up a case which i and a few people made police report before but seems nothing much they can do also... i didnt stay there but my gf (yrs ago..) stay the same blk.....
 
ok.. to cut short... i make in point form..
 
a 5 room flat, son, wife and an 8-10yrs girl.. one old father (~70yrs) with problem walking, have walk holding to the wheelchair....
 
everyday, that bloody couple would leave this old man at their flat playground early morning and go for work and daughter to school...
 
yes, daily, the old man just hang around the playground.., most of the time, just sxxt and pees in pants( have diapers on)...
 
heard the couple dont like him stay at home alone with no one to take care (fair enough) but to leave him alone at the playground whole day??? 
 
sometimes, DIL come at lunch time with packet of food for him to eat at the playground....but not everyday...
 
old man sometimes have to snacth food/drink from kids playing at the playground...
 
most people around that blk know about this pity old man and helpful people would bring him food/drink if happen to pass by.....
 
one fine day saturday around 11am, old man also at downstair playground..... 
 
while waitign for my gf at the loading/unloading bay lot, saw him felt down .... i rush over with a few more people who saw him felt down... then those who stay there start to share all these story about him.... 
 
ok.. he was bleeding and can't really stand up properly..... so, we call police and ambulance... 
 
while waiting for police/ambulance...., those who know which unit he stay, go up and knock on door informing his family member...
 
after awhile, KNNCCB!!! the family was actually at home sleeping..  ... but the old man already left downstair alone on a saturday morning!!!!...
 
when he knew we call police, he keep saying wanted to bring old man home and no need police and ambulance.... family matter and we should not bother... say we keypoh... 
 
we didnt aloow and wait for police to come... after police came, we let them handle and we go our seperate way....
 
but 1wk+ after that incident, i still saw the old man hanging around the lobby and playground sometimes....  not sure what can the public do about others family matters if police also seems cannot do anything....

Really sad upon reading this.  To me, one of the greatest sins to commit is being unfilial.  It's the parents who brought us into this world, brought us up in whatever best way they can and this is how the ungrateful child repay back. Damn the son to be burnt in each of the 18 levels of hell for the longest time.

my thought back then was:--> i really hope his daughter won't learn and think the way her parents think and treat their grandfather is "OK" and accepatable when she grow up.... but on the other hand, i hope this bloody son and DIL will have their karma and be treated like that when they r old... let them face their karma when the time is up for payment...

Sad  
 
Being the parent of 2 young monster at home now, I begin to appreciate more of the hardship that my parent went through by raising us up. Before that, I sometime do think that parents's care for us is natural, I never think so much on how to repay them by spending more time with them. 
 
So i am really more and more can not understand why got people never think back how much their parent have done for them

sad case indeed .. 
but what's more sad was the old man's son himself did this to him ... what goes around comes around ... filial piety goes both ways and also to both sides of the family (ie your own and also your in-laws) ... 
 
guys (& gals) remember that you choose your wife(husband) but you can't choose your parents ... I believe all cultures and religions teach us to be filial to our parents ... so if you or your partner is ill treat your/their own parents perhaps it's time to rethink about it seriously ... and make your final choice

自上周推出 宏茂桥私人组屋反应淡 The response to the AMK DBSS not as hot
29 July 2008 2102hrs
 
 
新传媒新闻报道，本地第三个私人组屋项目，宏茂桥Park Central自上星期推出后，吸引了两万多人前去参观1000多人申请。市场的反应不如今年初在文庆路推出的私人组屋。 
 
华丽装潢的组屋，走的是比较高档的公寓式路线。共有578个单位，每平方尺售价500元的Park Central，至今收到了一千多份申请，截止日期是在8月5日。反应虽然不算热烈，不过发展商有信心、询问者都是潜质高的买家。

SINGAPORE: Singapore's third condominium-style public housing project, ParkCentral@AMK received over 2,300 applications at the end of a two-week sales period. That's four times more than the total number of units available. (only 4 times?) 
 
The project will comprise 578 units of four and five-room flats, including 20 penthouse apartments. They cost an average S$500 per square foot. 
 
Its developer, United Engineers, said Park Central has garnered lots of interest with a turnout of over 23,000 visitors at its showflats. 
 
Application for the flats ended on Tuesday and the balloting and selection process will start in mid-September. 
 
Despite being oversubscribed now, not every application will translate into sales. Observers said that is because successful applicants could still change their minds about buying the property after being selected. 
 
This was evident in the sale of a similar public housing project, City View @ Boon Keng, where it was five times oversubscribed, but only 66 per cent of the units were sold after the ballot. 
 
City View's marketing agent said one reason for the lukewarm take up rate was that many of the applicants did not meet the eligibility criteria laid out by the public housing board. 
 
So potential buyers were screened by the developer of Park Central to make sure they fulfil the necessary requirements before applying for the flats. 
 
It is hoped that this will minimise distortion to the application numbers and speed up processing time. - CNA/vm/ms

Total applications received for CityView is 3500, which is 7x. But now still have left over  .  

Anyway, applying DBSS is free, so many people will apply and consider later. 
 

Now BTO has penalty, can not anyhow apply 

 

I think DBSS is unlike BTO which have penalty if reject selection 2 times in a year. Cos its Design, Built and Sell by private developer. So no harm applying, and if no suitable units within one's budget can give up the chance. 
 

The developer of Park Central are sneaky cos they don't publish the prices of individual units like City View. So depending on the "demand" (I think 2300 application for 500+ units are quite bad ) they can adjust the pricing a bit.

Applicants can also apply online without being screened. Somemore no need to pay any money for application. So how many of those 2300 applicants are eligible are uncertain.

Yah, after going thru the news, I realised that their so call screening is only means for the show flat visitor. 
 
You can always apply without meeting  the requirement
