HDB takes action against 56 flat owners for illegal sub-letting
 
 

SINGAPORE : The Housing and Development Board (HDB) has taken action against 56 flat owners for illegal sub-letting between January 2008 and December last year. 
 

Most were fined between S$1,000 and S$21,000. 
 

One owner had his flat repossessed for blatantly flouting HDB's sub-letting rules. 
 

Giving details of the case, HDB said it first received feedback on the unauthorised sub-letting of a unit in Block 336 Bukit Batok Street 32 on November 11 last year. 
 

The flat was bought by Poh Boon Kay, who is a registered real estate agent. His wife was listed as an occupier. 
 

He purchased the four-room flat from the open market in June 2007 without any loan. 
 

HDB said the couple are also owners of five private properties. Its investigations found that the flat was sublet without its prior approval to three couples. 
 

Mr Poh and his family did not live in the flat. 
 

He was informed on November 25 to take immediate steps to evict the unauthorised sub-tenants, failing which HDB would take compulsory acquisition action. 
 

However, the subtenants continued to occupy the flat. A notice to compulsorily acquire the flat was then served on December 23. 
 

Mr Poh informed HDB on the same day that the sub-tenants had signed an undertaking to vacate the flat by the end of December. 
 

A day later, the couple appealed. He claimed that the sub-tenant needed time to work out his finances before buying over the flat from Mr Poh. 
 

He had therefore decided to rent out the flat to the sub-tenants in the interim. 
 

On January 5, when the couple was interviewed by HDB, they claimed they did not know that they needed to seek the board's prior approval before subletting the flat. 
 

They also claimed that they were not aware of the policy for flat owners to fulfil the Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) of three years before they were eligible to sublet the whole flat. 
 

HDB's further investigations have shown that Mr Poh is also related to two other cases of unauthorised subletting at Bukit Batok and Telok Blangah. 
 

With these further instances of unauthorised subletting related to Mr Poh, his claims that he is "unaware" of HDB rules cannot be substantiated. 
 

HDB said as he has blatantly flouted HDB's rules, there are no grounds for leniency and legal action has been taken to compulsorily acquire the flat. 
 

HDB will also be taking legal action to compulsorily acquire the other two flats. 
 

HDB would like to emphasise the severity of unauthorised subletting. HDB flats are meant for owner occupation. Flat owners who wish to sublet their whole flat must obtain approval from HDB and fulfil the MOP. 
 

The current MOP for the subletting of flats is as follows: 
 

*Flats bought directly from HDB - 5 years 
 

*Resale flats purchased with CPF Housing Grant - 5 years 
 

*Resale flats purchased without CPF Housing Grant - 3 years

These owners still dunno how to die....

I am sure more than 56, just curious if HDB gets 100% of proceeds from the sale of the confiscated flat?
 

If really like this, then the 56,000 better be worried.

my opinion.. instead of catching scapegoats and setting up countless of rules or even more new rules, the govt should just minimize the loopholes and make things simplier.
 

it's like covering leaking holes using rubber tubes and not fixing the whole bloody problem.............
 

how?.. simple.
 

look at your payslip.

if you still do not know how to solve simple problems in a small country, there are many wisers who know better.

many others who are controlling states which are much much bigger than the size of SG land.
 

best of all, they are earning much lesser. *shakes head*

i believe HDB is trying to use this case as a warning to all HDB owners. it wants to send out a signal that they mean what they says. HDB will not take ignorance as an excuse not to know that MOP has to be fulfill.
 

these agents blatantly advertise the pinnacle flats for rental - testing waters or plain ignorance? 

$3300/mth, this is really good rental income for a HDB flat. wonders which ignorant tenants will take the bait and end up being evicted by HDB when the whole fiasco gets exposed!
 

no wonders all the pinnacle flats get snapped up despite prices of 500 to 700k for new flats.

My cousin had stayed in the HDB flat for more than 20 years.

He surely meets the MOP.

He rented out recently.
 

Does he need to tell HDB that he had rented out his flat?

Anyone know the consequences of not reporting??
 

What will the HDB do if no one report to them after renting out?? 

Does that consider illegal??
 

But i wonder how HDB caught these 56 house owner??
 

Someone tipped off?? >> By relatives, neighbors, or property agent??
 

HDB do a check>> routine check or what so ever....
 

Anyone can have an answer to these??
 

Thank you to any property guru.....

HDB ruling is that all tenants renting the unit must register the names with HDB.
 

HDB will check when there is complain by someone, or by random checks.
 

Tenants who rent the unit will also have to pay for stamp duty fee to IRAS.
 

Do let me know should u need further clarification.

Screw those who play with HDB.  HDB is not for playing.
 

Just like OPC. It is for people who truly need them and use them for what they were meant.
 

imagine many people buying OPCs to rent out and taking up the bulk of COEs thereby driving prices upwards and denying people who truly need an OPC.  (ok , i'm a bit out of point becos no one truly ever need an OPC... heh)

this is for MOP, it's different from rental. For rental, it's still 3 years (used to be 5 & 10). But rem, renting out of HDB flats is subjected to HDB approval, meaning even if one has fulfilled 3 years MOP, they can't rent out unless approval from HDB is obtained.

In forums, we been hearing 
 

FT take away our jobs
 

FT take away our flats
 

FT push our property prices up
 

Let's face it, they are here to stay and property prices will continue to climb, I only pity the younger generation who don't hv well-to-do parents and they don't make enough to get their own flats.
 

They probably have to live on hand down flats from their parents provided they don't have a competing sibling plus if their parents don't take up HDB's Lease Buyback Scheme whereby HDB will buy back the tail-end of your lease, after subtracting 30 years, at Market Value and not Market Price of your flat.

seriously, why HDB continue with market pricing approach instead of cost-pricing approach ? what is the merit of market-pricing approach that i did not understand ?
 

if there are many "approved" developers for hdb flats that they can build&sell flats individually, then market-pricing is acceptable as competition will keep the price competitive (so to speak)
 

what we have here is one and only one corporation that can sell hdb. so market-pricing is determined and controlled, isn't it ? if profit is crucial, using cost-pricing + profit margin for business sustainability is acceptable too
 

what's going on ?

I think this has been discussed before. HDB will be earning the wrath of either the current flat owners or the would-be buyers either way they move the prices. So rather, keep in status quo and minimize fluctuations going forward. 
 

Imagine you paid 300k for a 4 rm flat and then next day the price dropped to 150k for a similar unit in your estate. What would you think?
 

Another way to look at it is to provide for the construction related companies here. At the end, the flat owners are the real paymasters for all of these related industry.

no need to call.. there's this thing called HDB website.
 

Q5.    I own a private property and would like to reside there and sublet my HDB flat. Is this allowed?    

A Owners may sublet their flat if they have met the minimum occupation period:
 

For non-subsidised flats (flats purchased from the open market without a CPF housing grant), flat owners must have occupied their flat for at least 3 years; 
 
 

For subsidised flats (flats purchased directly from the HDB or from the open market with a CPF housing grant), flat owners must have occupied their flat for at least 5 years.

Flat owners who meet the eligibility requirements above and who concurrently own a private property, are allowed to stay in the private property and sublet the HDB flat.
 
 

However, prior approval from HDB must be obtained before they sublet the flat.

I reckon no one bothered to get approval.

so that makes it all illegal.
 

HDB , do your work and nail these guys .  right where it hurts...
