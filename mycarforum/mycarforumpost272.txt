Since Condo got more lots than cars, why the MC must impose such charges?

This should only apply to those condo with more cars than lots!

Parking woes spark a parking war at Sea View condo  
 








 

The car's owner, Mr Sia Kong Wah, used his car (above) to block the entrance of Sea View condominium to show his frustration over the estate's new parking rules.
 

By Hedy Khoo
 

FOR more than an hour on last Wednesday afternoon, a silver Nissan was parked at the entrance to this condominium estate on Amber Road.
 

The car's owner, Mr Sia Kong Wah, 55, refused to move his vehicle, which was blocking cars from entering the 546-unit private estate, The Sea View.
 

Mr Sia left the car's bonnet open and switched on the hazard indicator lights.
 

Asked why the vehicle was there, Mr Sia, who is retired, claimed that his car was "sick" and that his mechanic was on the way from Johor Bahru.
 

The incident resulted in the police having to be called in to settle the matter.
 

But Mr Sia's antics were the culmination of anger simmering since October among a group of residents at The Sea View towards the condo's management committee (MC) over car parking issues.
 

The MC comprises 14 owners who volunteer their time to manage the estate.
 

When The New Paper turned up at the estate on Wednesday, Mr Sia was standing near a lift lobby, about 6m from his car, saying he "had no choice" but to do so.
 

He said he had applied with the management office for a temporary carpark slip for his sister-in-law who would be visiting from Malaysia on Sunday. He claimed that the management had demanded that his sister-in-law produce the log card for her car on arrival.
 

He said: "For two years, she has been visiting us frequently and stayed over almost every weekend. There has never been an issue over the parking. Suddenly there are all these new regulations."
 

Saying the MC chairman wouldn't meet him, he said: "This is the only way to get her attention. I wanted her to solve my problem."

On the dashboard and back windscreen of Mr Sia's parked car were four A4-sized copies of an unsigned handwritten note.
 

The notes were attentioned to the "residents of Sea View (with or without grievances)". They said that the vehicle "is very angry" with the management of The Sea View "for setting ridiculous carpark rules".
 

The note ended with an apology: "Sorry for the inconvenience caused."
 

As a result of Mr Sia's car blocking the driveway, the condo security guard had to divert incoming traffic via the exit driveway.
 

One resident who came downstairs to see the commotion was Mr Dawson Lim, 32, a senior executive with a bank.
 

He said that while the obstruction at the barrier gates was inconvenient, there was an alternative entrance along East Coast Road.
 

At 4.30pm, two policemen arrived and spoke with Mr Sia. Another three policemen arrived on the scene. They spoke with Mr Sia and staff of the management office.
 

Mr Sia, who owns two units in the estate, was overheard telling the officers that he wanted to see the MC chairman.
 

A staff member from the management office, who only identified himself as Mr Pung, showed up. He spoke with the condo security guards and the policemen.
 

He later told this reporter to leave and even raised his voice. A police officer advised him to calm down.
 

Mr Sia finally moved his car at 5.15pm. However, he stayed around the area and continued speaking with the policemen.
 

Thursday's drama wasn't the first incident last week. On Wednesday, 10 residents including Mr Sia, tried to submit a petition signed by 159 residents, each representing one unit.
 

The petition called for transparency in the way that the council has decided to impose the carpark charges, as well as a removal of the charges. The group gathered outside a meeting room in the basement carpark where the MC was having a meeting.
 

Mr Sia gave his name to a security guard stationed outside the room and entered the room to ask who the chairman was.
 

He also wanted an update on the status of his visitor lot application.
 

When told by the chairman that he was not allowed to speak, Mr Sia demanded to see the rules. A heated exchange ensued.
 

Two security guards were then called in to escort Mr Sia out of the room.
 

In the end, the residents who were waiting outside the room to submit the petition were turned away.
 

Frustrated, a few of them tried to prevent the council members from leaving. Others whipped out their camera phones and took videos and photographs.
 

New charges, but residents say there are enough lots
 

ON OCT 7, residents at The Sea View received a letter from the condo management informing them of new parking charges for their second, third and fourth cars.
 

Residents were advised to apply for new car decals and pay by Nov 1. The rates are $120 for the second car, $300 for the third car and $400 for the fourth car.
 

The circular stated that as of Sept 1, the number of issued carpark labels was 115 per cent of the available lots at the estate.
 

The New Paper spoke to six residents with more than one car, who feel there are more than enough lots in the estate.
 

In the letter, the council stated that each unit is given one carpark lot.
 

There are another 30 lots for emergency vehicles, the handicapped and visitors.
 

The letter said the council had agreed during the first annual general meeting (AGM) held last year that "should the allocation of parking spaces go above 85 per cent, the MCST would act to restrict the allocation of second, third and fourth car lots using a combination of parking fees and outright restrictions"."
 

Council chairman Tan Lee Keng told The New Paper: "The management reserves the right to impose the charges or any other amount that may be decided.
 

"So, there are no conditions attached to how we can exercise this by-law, but we just have to do it for the best benefit and best interest of the estate."
 

When asked for the numbers of cars issued with carpark labels, Ms Tan replied: "We do not have to give absolute numbers because they fluctuate all the time."
 

Several residents who refused to pay the fees found their vehicles wheel-clamped from Nov 8
 
 

They had to pay $160.20 per car to have the wheelclamps removed.
 

Resident Madam Sim Kain Kain, 45, who runs a real estate business, was one of them.
 

She owns three cars together with her husband but parks only two at the condo. She leaves her third car at her office carpark.
 

On Nov 18, she drove the third car as the car she usually drove was sent for servicing.
 

She claimed she had explained that to the guard and got a temporary parking slip.
 

Said Madam Sim: "They have my unit number and name. The security could have easily contacted me via the intercom and let me know if there is any problem before putting the wheelclamp on my car."
 

Mr Ken Lum, 31, an operations manager at a bank whose family owns three cars, feels the carpark charges are unjustified: "This is absurd. There is no reason for the fees because there are more than enough lots available for residents and visitors."
 

On Nov 15 and Nov 18, at 1am, his mother and other residents counted the number of cars parked in the estate. The tally was 368 cars for the first day, and 383 cars for the second. Residents say there are 570 lots in the estate.
 

Their findings and petition were submitted to the council on Thursday morning when the residents made a second attempt to hand it in at the management office.
 

On Friday the council chairman, Ms Tan, said a resolution had been passed to reduce the carpark charges to $70 for the second car, $250 for the third car and $350 for the fourth car, from February.
 

Rules, fees depend on estates
 

DIFFERENT estates each have their own policy when it comes to issues like parking.
 

However Mr Francis Zhan, 65, the chief executive of the Association of Management Corporations in Singapore, said having parking charges set at $400 per month for a resident's fourth car is quite unusual and exorbitant.
 

In estates where there is a shortage of lots, it is common practice to charge residents a nominal fee of $50 per month for parking a second car and $100 for a third car.
 

Said Mr Zhan: "Usually there is no parking charge set for a fourth car because the assumption is that if a resident can be allowed to park a fourth car, it means there are sufficient lots which would not justify the high charges."

think this uncle tot that he bot the ALL condo...
 

facility in the condo is a shared asset among all the condo owners. Be it carpark, badminton court, gym or swimming pool. Its not an excuse to say that no one use why can i own more? If everyone do the same thing, the whole condo will be chaos...
 

Just imagine, what if some of the residents happen to know that they can have more than 1 lot without any restriction?? they may "rent" it out to nearby residents at ridiculars low price, and if 1 owner sold 10 lots, and there are only 10 of such jokers around, 100 carpark lots is occupied "illegally"... 
 

anyone know the unker?? maybe i can go n tell him to let me use his toilet while he is not using, or sleep on his bed while he is working outside... see how he react...

This is like gangsterism. If unhappy can inconvinience everybody else? Some estates dont have enough carparks so the only way is to impose a charge to balance demand and supply just like the COE system. So if I am not happy with COE being so high I can park my car to block Parliment house or not? :P

Just install those double decker scissor lift!!

Instantly double the parking lots in the condo!!!
 

The condo owner owns and share the entire condo land, yet have to kena left right center from an external management company incompetent's rules.
 

Actually the management is stupid. They should actually let the situation go out of hand in the first place, before they implement the extra fees. Let the carparks be filled to the brim during holidays and CNY period. Let the residents feel the trouble or no finding a lot when they come home late at night. Let those with two or more cars or three cars buy more cars to park there.

One day those who can't get lots will call for a EOGM, and ask to implement the charges! Then go for a EOGM vote!

this serves as another thing to look out for when buying condo.

avoid buying anything with more than 300units.

too many households , sure got more problems.
 

also with too many households, it is no longer private, it's more "public"

This is a condo run by communists. IMO staying at hdb is more peaceful. No such desperate measures. But it's not uncommon to hear of condos who have unreasonable committee members who think they are smith else. Ppl should live & let live moreover there are ample parking lots.

Very selfish lah this uncle. He may have a grievance but end up inconveniencing others? Hope some other angry guy scratch his car, since he use it to block the entrance... Since his car is "sick", it needs some "surgery" or "acupuncture" 
 

I don't understand some condo people - got money to pay for car and condo, but no spare change to pay some extra charges??
 

Staying in condo, should know that there are many extra charges compared to HDB - one reason why I prefer not to "upgrade". (And actually looking at residents' behaviour, I think stay in condo also not much improvement... )

The over issue of carpark lable could be mainly due to many who likes to apply additional labels for relatives. Free one, no harm to apply right??

Like father or bro/sis or GF/BF. 

Sometimes parents will come in the day time to look after the grandsons, fetch them to schools,etc.

Sometimes bro/sis will come weekends to bbq or swimming.

Sometimes lovers come overnight to fark.

Dont expect them to keep going to get visitors pass everyday!! Some more visitor pass cannot park overnight!!

Since second n third car label is free, might as well apply, and less hassle when coming for the above reasons!
 

Its expected that when they actually count the carpark empty lots, of course there are plenty empty lots. Since those extra cars will not be there at the same time and day.
 

MCST is 100% wrong in this particular condo issue, judging from the empty lots that is available.

Imagine every month pay $548.91 per month for maintenance fee, and on top of that, got to pay additional for extra lot...

just because you have the ability to pay doesnt mean you should have to in the first place.

sometimes all these rules are non existance until some kaypoh guard starts noticing your family.. In the past, my family didn't even have to pay a cent for 3 cars.. The guards steady one. New batch of guards/ management came after, then must pay for 2nd and 3rd car. That's fine.. No fine print that each household can only park 3 cars. So when my sister and wife got license, we bought two more. When the car came, management told us cannot park there.. f--king bang balls.. Cannot even register to other units that don't have a car but here the irony, my sisters car that was very common manage to siam. Can register using other unit but my wife's car which was slighty more extravagant, cannot. Then i realise that the number plate kenna mark. For my area, the management don't check log card. Just need to give car number. The fact is we got screwed by the guards. Want to pay also cannot pay. I LL move out my car to the nearby HDB carpark. Best part now is that the management suddenly u turn the whole decision and allow me to park my car at the temporary visitor lot but need to pay monthly charges. So now my car is second class citizen in it's own home.. 
 

Another factor is those eat to full loser neighbours who would go around asking why that car got no label or why is it that car park alway visitor lot.. These parasites consistantly would keep complaining. That's what some of the nicer guards told me..

I guess you dont know the condo management committee consist of volunteers who give up their free time to solve the condo problems and are not paid. You like to do this sort of "job"? Kena tekan for decisions which you made for the best interest of all the condo owners and not a word of thanks?

If in this case, there isnt enough parking lots, what do you suggest the MCST do? Its easy to complain but not easy to solve the problems yeah? 
 

The newer condos dont build excess car lots so extra lots in demand will need to be distributed according to who is prepared to pay just like the COE system. Even HDB has problems like this where there arent enough car park lots to cater to 2/3 car families. Indeed if so wealthy to have so many cars, these HDB dwellers should move to landed property.

The over issue of carpark lable could be mainly due to many who likes to apply additional labels for relatives. Free one, no harm to apply right??

Like father or bro/sis or GF/BF. 

Sometimes parents will come in the day time to look after the grandsons, fetch them to schools,etc.

Sometimes bro/sis will come weekends to bbq or swimming.

Sometimes lovers come overnight to fark.

Dont expect them to keep going to get visitors pass everyday!! Some more visitor pass cannot park overnight!!

Since second n third car label is free, might as well apply, and less hassle when coming for the above reasons!
 

Its expected that when they actually count the carpark empty lots, of course there are plenty empty lots. Since those extra cars will not be there at the same time and day.
 

MCST is 100% wrong in this particular condo issue, judging from the empty lots that is available.

A reissue o



 

A condo is a private property, it is not meant for public use or outsider use.

If a label is issued to every ah te ah kow with relation to family then clearly , it cannot be right.

any outsider (non resident) must get a visitor pass. Yes, each and every time.

This ensures security of the PRIVATE property.

a good mcst and condo committee will prevent such lapses.

Labels are issued free to residents who have more than one car.

for the issuance of the label, proof of car ownership is a MUST.
 

In terms of parking overnight, a good MCST and mgmt committee will understand and accept that visiting relatives and friends can park overnight but every single time they exit , they must get a visitor pass again.
 

Of course a suakoo, low class condo resident usually cannot understand all these, becos they are not able to think of things in the bigger scheme. they are very "Me myself and I."  They are more suitable to stay in "public" property
 

Therefore, good condos are not only defined by the location, they are also defined by the resident or tenancy mix.  Prospective buyers take note when you visit showflats and you see the wrong kind of people also in the showflat, beware.  these could be the people you will be sharing your PRIVATE property with.....

some time its not because of wealthy. But because of job requirement.
 

imagine if in a family there are 3 ppl doing outdoor sales and car is their requirement. how will you expect them not to have so many car. and their pay might not be good enough to move to landed. (not all sales are earning big bucks)

If got 3 cars, even is move to landed, the parking problem will still exist. Most landed these days is max 2 cars. Parking on roadside is considered a gamble.
 

MCST and the Managing Agent have to put in place a policy that is logical and self sustaining. The issue at hand is not the number of physical lots available, but the over issuing of labels. So, if landlord gets to keep the label, then the tenant drives, so.. 1 unit issues 2 labels? Landlord goes shopping nearby, then park there FOC?
 

If there is no cost to issuing of second label, then how the MCST or MA going to prioritise who gets the spare float? Frens of MCST members get higher priority? Or who bang table loudest? Charging is correct for now to force a reduction in spare labels. After a sustainable level is achieved, then see how best to keep it ongoing logically. 
 

Right now, it does not make sense that regular visitors are entitled to spare labels. Might as well charge hourly rate for non residents. Then problem solved right?

So the way to distribute the sought after parking lots are to subject them to charge yeah? Same problem with HDB, if every HDB has 2 cars, I am sure the MS cant cope. 
 

Then how to solve the problem? Of course can build bigger MS but takes time. So restrict to 1 car per HDB or charge more so the ones that cant tahan will not have additional car. 
 

Its the same problem with car growth, if everybody in SG say they "need" a car, the roads will be a parking lot, so people who wants a car now need to bid for COE & the govt is the happy tax collector.

Not only are the new condos more expensive but there are compromises in their facillities. For instance kitchens & yards are small, fewer carpark lots, smaller common areas..all designed to optimise profits for the developers. 
 

Same thing with the newer HDB, 5 room size now the size of 4 room size in the past.

HDB peasants are just as shameless too but given their limited status they fare just a tad lower than their condo counterparts! 
 

Moreoever, it seems very obvious to most Sinkies that most of those condo residents, had been pervious HDB pigeon holers, who had not only brought their  vile and shameless character over to their 'new found private residences', they even have to cheek, to think they are now entitled to some  'new types of personal entitlement' which they perviously had to share with the public at large!

this one is damn hard to judge esp for a new development. got all types of unreasonable people in all social and economic strata. judging from their dressing, appearances and body language at a showroom is not trustworthy. 
 

Although these people differ in their mode of operation, their outcomes are always similar, ie, that they and only they, will benefit, regardless of the inconvenience and cost it brings to others.
 

best is buy a used unit so that you can recee the neighbours before signing on the dotted line.

secondly, $1.5kpsf is current price.

before that it was probably less than $800psf so majority of the owners are from the mass market segment.

whether a condo is mass market depends on the resident/tenancy mix rather than the price.

although there is a relation between the two.
 

This may mean that a mass market condo could be expensive at this current point in time but it is still mass market due to resident mix.

A cheaper condo may not necessary be a mass market condo just becos it is cheap.

If it caters to a none mass market group of buyers, then you will expect some exclusivity.
 

This is how developers can maintain their development identity and also future value.
 

sorry if anyone feels offended, i'm just trying to bring up a point which many overlook.
 

bottomline, this is to say that cheaper condos doesnt mean low standard but rather that the definition of a good condo also depends a lot on the people who live there.
 

cheers

this one is damn hard to judge esp for a new development. got all types of unreasonable people in all social and economic strata. judging from their dressing, appearances and body language at a showroom is not trustworthy. 
 

Although these people differ in their mode of operation, their outcomes are always similar, ie, that they and only they, will benefit, regardless of the inconvenience and cost it brings to others.
 

best is buy a used unit so that you can recee the neighbours before signing on the dotted line.



 
 

yes, it is always hard to judge and be 100% sure but it is not hard to get a feel.....

I choose to trust my feel, always. and have never been wrong to date.
 

From the design, location and the considerations of the developer, one can already predict the kind of resident mix.

no need to wait until TOP to recce....

After working/interacting with many malaysian...I cant help but think that Malaysian are the cause of ungraceful image of Singapore.  Feel that malayisan chinese like to complain about the things and ppl around them and act selfishly because they dont feel the sense of belonging in singapore. 
 

If i am not wrong this guy that park his car at seaview is from malaysia.



 

only those who have close contacts with msian chinese will understand..that makes the 2 of us..the rest i shall not elaborate more
