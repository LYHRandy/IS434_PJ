Exercise from SERS site if not open to public during the selection sure have balance de. But i doubts after the release of these balance flats, should left no more liao, as queenstown such a popular location.

But it is grossly oversubscribed which is to be expected.

Think there were abundance of flats from this SERS exercise cos they were more flats built vis a vis SERS tenants and as it was not sold to public, these flats should be the balance after all the SERS tenants chose their flats.

Not really. Heartlander will be quite dry paying for the expensive HDB that the only jam will be train. By then, Car lite reality will kick in.
 
And if the economy stay stable, the interest rate will remains high. Lets hope the train dont breakdown.
 
If you notice the ratio, seems that they are building a number of 2 room one hall units. So will not be a nightmare.
 
Probably there is a slight chance of PHV causing jam because the population of PHV are now at 40,000 and climbing.
 
Waiting for LTA to wise up that PHV do not need to scrap the vehicle on Year 7 vs Taxis.

err.......hv u not stayed in hdb for the last 20yrs?? or is it jus u looking down on ppl staying in hdb? my MSCP sees additional new cars on a monthly basis. every mth, there will definitely b ppl buying cars. so im not sure where u get the idea that ppl staying in hdb will b dry paying for their flats. 
 
n as of now, margaret dr is already pretty jammed up every morning with cars trying to join queensway. n there r only 2 new sites. with the 3 big sites coming up, even if only half of the residents own cars, the roads there will surely b more jammed.

The SERs upgrade has Urban planning consideration. After all, it is Singapore we are talking about. All the Car Lite will converge and hence if the MRT and the timeline of the satellite converge, there will be not a need to have cars really.
 
Owning a car from being a statement whether you are rich or not does not equate in this social landscape anymore. Everyone else in general is making a decent standard of living. So giving up cars with the convenience of a jump to Raffles place for work is the main draw. Given the fact that even if you are a SVP in a bank does not provide you with a parking lot nowadays.
 
Being able to have children that has filial piety and living a fulfilling Retirement in the silver age matters the most.
 
And hence the SERs population are mostly the aged population at Tanglin halt. There will be none of that traffic jam situation.
 
Take a look at JG hospital. I would think getting an ambulance into there would be the main issue. You Have JEM, WestGate, IMM as well as a ST office there. Yet , the traffic can best be describe as manageable.
 
Having said that, I have alot of faith that the Urban planner nail this. After all, Dawson has been one of the better plans in the making for years.
 
I also have hope that the emphasis for majority of those are actually thinking of financial freedom in getting a Condo to rent out or that money is invested in some financial instrument that can generate income and not just because the next door Mr Tan has a new A180, One must die die get a Merc C300 to show who has really make it in this neighborhood.

urban planning, car lite etc doesnt really matter to a lot of ppl. when they wanna buy a car, they will buy a car. hv u given up ur car for this car lite movement? n wat has this got to do with having filial piety children n retirement got to do with traffic at dawson area? it may even make things worst. those filial children living with parents may wanna buy a car to ferry their parents ard. those retired with gd financial planning also may wanna buy a car to enjoy their hard earned savings. 
 
n not all of the new 5 upcoming projects are for SERS. i live at dawson now n pass by these projects daily. thousands n thousands of flats will b built. n like i said, even if only half of those moving in hv cars, it will b terrible. the roads there r only 1 lane, dawson rd, strathmore, kaysiang, margaret...all 1 lane. n i don see them trying to expand the roads. so if u r talking abt urban planner nailing this.....i am more than happy to b proven wrong.

its all have to do with financial prudence and priorities in life.
 
Having a car is great. That's why we are in this forum. Prioritize having a car because its an image is a little hard to imagine. 
 
I believe that even if there are owners who have cars, they will be parked at the car park and only use occasionally. 
 
The changing landscape has moved so much that the cars may well be, for lack of a better word, irrelevant.
 
It would have become quite unnecessary if the push and the transport were more reliable. By 2020, the train stations would have been quite fully functional and be getting from the home to the train station to the workplace would be a breeze. Why would anyone want to have a depreciating asset?. 
 
The aging population also mean that many would either be more reliant on transports like cab or BUS or Train instead.
 
Unless the new tenants are one car per family or even 3 cars per family, I doubt there will be a jam.
 
Even today, if you look at the Bicycles and Mobility scooters are allowed to be brought into the trains. there has been a surge of this hybrid commuting. So much so that those who bring in those Mobility devices for sales are practically millionaires.
 
Its a matter of time before we evolved to the next phase, but I still look forward to seeing what its going to be like when its fully populated and how the urban planner has done it.

From my understanding, you are able to buy any type of flat if your blk is under SERS project, not necessary if your old flat is 3 room, they will upgrade you to 4 room. Its all depends whether you are able to afford it or not. Relocation of the new flats usually will not be far from the old site, but also depends on many other factors de.

Some may not want to start another loan if their old flats r fully paid.

Lets break the question into 2 parts
 
1.  if our parents stay in the hdb long time already n then bought a Pte condo for investment, then when they kena SER-ed, then if they buy a new replacement flat, do they hv to give up their condo
 
*******
If you mean you want to buy another HDB and keep the condo, then you have 2 choices.
 
From my limited understanding, u have to Tenant out the Condo and move back to HDB. Or at least that what my colleague is doing.
 
Else
 
Sell the condo like what you intended to do and have the SERs upgrade and move back into HDB. 
 
If the delta and Condo appreciation makes sense, then you probably want to do the later. 
 
You however Will NOT be able to get the SERS upgrade and tanant out the new HDB if thats a option you are looking at.
 
They stay here > 10yrs Liao before kena SER-ed.
 
Not too sure what the situation is but I imagine it to be, bought condo, stay condo. Eligible to rent out the HDB for income.

thanks bros for your kind advice...
 
My parents are staying in the HDB and got the condo after many years in the HDB and tenanted it out... 
 
If my parents got the SERS replacement flat and continue to stay in this replacement HDB flat, they can still keep the condo (tenant it out) like they are doing now? There will not be any adverse conditions for them to get the SERS replacement flat (like have to sell the condo?) 
 
By common sense, if the SERS did not happen, then they would still be able to have both the current HDB flat AND the condo, and this is within the current rulings.
 
So if the SERS was setup upon them , then logically they will just swop the replacement flat for the old one and nothing else should be changed (i.e. no minimum MOP of 5 yrs for getting the new replacement flat....)
 
Heard from property agents, the "right" way is to stay in HDB and tenant out the pte property. But the "left" way many people are doing is to lock one bedroom and rent out the HDB and stay in condo....anyone can confirm this?

Find one day, make an appointment and go down to HDB to ask instead of asking all the people on here (think majority do not even live in HDB).
 
Property agents are also not experts on this.
 
After clarifying in person, go back home and write an email and make them confirm via email as well because you can't trust the government these days.

How to have a glut? Still got 3 to 4 years backlog leh. 
Even if there's excess, hdb can just hold on to the uncompleted blocks to avoid flooding the market right (in fact, this is what hdb should be doing instead of having people apply for flats 4 years before they are even ready to get married.)

Yes and No. How to account for the financial closing and accountability to the people?
 
The book keeping exercise is quite large and to a certain degree, complicated. Managing accrual and balance the market is two different piece of the equation. It's still not a Private entity for HDB. Else, the number of the unsold unit would have a backlash and outcry of developers been slap with a tax of unsold unit while HDB has a surplus are not taxed.

All the issues you brought up sound like minor problems (financial closing? really?) compared having people wait 4 years for their homes and committing to get married before they are ready.
 
But yeah, maybe our government really has those reasons in mind and that's why we are in such a state. Wouldn't surprise me.

 	Three HDB projects in Dawson and Punggol win awards for landscaping and greenery 
The six blocks at SkyOasis @ Dawson, along the Alexandra Canal Linear Park, has sky gardens on the 14th and 35th storeys, and a roof garden on the second floor. There is also a landscaped "eco deck" that will have a playground catering to the young and the elderly.

looks like 3 more years to finish building in 2020 4th qtr.
 
Just not sure why the windows and frame are starting to be installed at the lower floors.
 
My Guess is a working area office and beta test of material and stuff for the build.

I believe usually lower floor units might be used for contractor purpose? I saw before there is lights on in lower floor unit at night, as if like someone is staying inside the unit?!

Thats what I am thinking as well.
 
Will that also mean they will scrap everything and redo the window once the unit needs to be released for occupant?
