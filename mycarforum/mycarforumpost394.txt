Why do you care which bank is better? You are borrowing, not investing.
 

Best is the bank closes down or messes up its records and you get your loan for free. Hahaha.
 

I mean if I borrow from ah long, I would pray every day that the ah long gets arrested or knocked down by car and die, right?

just took a loan recently so I can share a bit la...u have to call all the different banks from local to foreign such as citi, anz, stanchart, etc. Ask them for their rates. OCBC and some local banks like to propose you to take up their bank board rates...generally I avoid that.. you also need to decide if you want 1 month sibor, 3 months or 6 months...there are also sor rates packages as well. 
 

for me, I took the anz bank loan as they offer legal rebates and some freebies vouchers...gotta to take note that most of the banks are no longer allowed to provide any freebies...so its really up to you to decide how many months and whether you want sibor or sor....and of cos the lock-in period. 
 

BTW never take the bankers that are recommended by your agent....they get a cut in the commission...find your banker and you can ask for such rebates "under table"

New or resale?
 

Some banks offer a lower rate for some new projects. 
 

If you intend to refinance every 3 yrs bec promo rates and lock-in usually apply for the first 3 yrs, citi/hsbc/ bank of china/ anz offering pretty competitive rates. 
 

Citi and HSBC packages are Sibor+0.9. 

BoC is SOR+0.85

ANZ is SOR+0.95 or SOR/SIBOR average+0.95

a bit blur as first time taking bank loan, so more questions:
 

- any view on whether it is better to based loan on sibor or sor?
 

- select law firm first or bank loan first?
 

- which law firm did you use?

If you believe rates will rise
 

then the best is a lock in fixed rate loan.
 

My bank refused to renew my fixed rate loan
 

and said they don't have any more fixed rate
 

loans. My guess is that they expect rates to rise
 

and don't sell fixed rate loans any more.

- sibor should be fine. more transparent imho (though the recent libor scandal should say otherwise). avoid loans using COF (cost of funds)
 

- both. you should already know where you want to exercise the option. but its always good to make sure the lawyer is on the bank's panel. have seen instances where they dont accept using a specific lawyer (though it's once in a blue moon)
 

i myself just took a home loan also - what you want to do is get a few quotes and pit the banks against each other. i can tell you right off the bat i got *slightly* lower than what sabian quoted (it also helps i work with banks almost daily too, i suppose). so there is room for negotiation.

ANZ was the last bank that still offer legal subsidies during late last year as the result of MAS ruling. Legal fees is about 2.8k and ANZ threw in 500 dollars of vouchers. That is the reason why I took ANZ SIBOR/SOR Combo package. I select bank loan first. My law firm is Eldan Law LPP....I chose them cos they are among the cheapest at 2.5k...but later was told they just jack it to 2.8k

When I took my home loan 8 years ago...didn't source out long...just wanted to get same bank I was using as "salary savings account" so I have 1 view of everything...well because as far as I believe it's still hutang no matter what...even my car loan is with the same bank (talk about loan loyalty haha...)...but after the lock in period I try to source out as I did a lump sum payment and wanted to shorten the loan tenure (now 10 years)...but in the end still stay with the same bank hehehe...OCBC...but me and wifey don't have cc with OCBC...sent us once but we cancelled..so not really that loyal hehehe..
 

Now not sure of how the market goes...

1) I understand banks stopped marketing SOR based loans where SOR when into the negative territory. Not sure about now.
 

2) & 3) Most law firms charge roughly at the same rate. So I left it to the bank to decide for me. Most important is to find a loan package which suits your needs. So I would say settle the bank part first.
 

 Fixed vs floating etc? Anyway, other than HDB loan which is fixed for the whole tenure, all "fixed" bank loans are only  fixed for the first 3-5 yrs. After that, it will convert to a floating basis. By then, your lock-in period would have expired and you can either choose to re-price or refinance it with another bank.

A supposedly good bank will not give the best deal all the times. Once the bank hit its quota, the best deals might be gone. So, it is best to ask all the banks and study all the options available. Choose the best loan offer, and not the bank. Be it fixed, sibor or whatever.

The best bank for any loan is one that offers the lowest rate.  The rest i.e lock-in period, clawback, legal subsidies, etc are pretty much std. For resale ppty, try using a mortgage broker, usually rates are a wee bit better than trying to go to the bank directly. If it's a new launch, the developer may hv some special rate tie-up wif their panel of banks.

hee.. i took my housing loan mid last yr when legal subsidies is still allowed. 
 
Took up the ANZ pkg mainly due to the fact it's spread is fixed through tenure.  0.7 + combo(SOR/SIBOR 3 mth).
Dun need to headache every few yrs... and lucky we took. Beside saving time. .. now also save $$, transfer fee now not free.. and across the board all banks increased their min spread.
 
So basically now.. i pay for 1.2 mil unit mid last yr.. with the same mthly instalment as 1.1 mil unit, with the same tenure. Even though the loan amt is different. ;)

yup but now no chance to get 0.7 + sibor loans anymore. think they are tightening controls on interest rates since people rather buy property still due to low interest rates.

grimnicks... the interest rate will stay low for the coming years. Most bank loans tried to sibor /sor will remain below 2% for sometimes time.. Now the impt considerating is the spread...
 

I understand Oz government has ask their banks to increase / decrease their spread.

Manupulative and lack transparency. this is more scary that sor / sibor increase.

unless they take away sor and sibor.. which MAS is negotiating with the banks..

SOR and SIBOR will not increase significately as EU and US economy is weak and fragile. 
 

Remember that big movement in exchange rate (basis of SOR and SIBOR) will affect corporate loans as well..

aniway.. their current way of solving the econ crisis, printing $$ is not sustainable. It's causing huge asset inflation across the globe.
 

It will burst.. just a matter of when. 

SG government just want to make sure that when it comes, there are enuff ppl staying in the properties that are built. 

So that the asset mkt will stay afloat and we are likely to escape huge deflation of value.

It's not really a gimmick because they are targeting HDB buyers who would otherwise opt for the HDB loan..... If they are promising that the rate will ALWAYS be lower than HDB for the next 10 years then how can you call it a gimmick just because you expect rates to stay low?

As mentioned in the title, which bank is better for property loan?
 
A little new to buying new property, please share your views.
Thanks

I prefer local bank. The offshore bank sometimes may have promotion but you know their saving pool is much smaller than that of local bank, so you know...

I think the best way to go is via a mortgage broker as they have access to all the banks in Singapore. From there, you can make the decision if you want to use any of the banks according to your preference.
 
Most banks operating in Singapore, regardless of size, they will need to fulfil MAS requirements of deposit safeguard. This is done by parking sums with MAS. But of cus, MAS will do a yearly audit to ensure the banks are stress tested.

Go check with a mortgage broker to work out what savings you can achieve if you switch to see if it’s worth it.
Refinancing has costs like legal fees, valuation fees etc as well.

Get out of Sibor packages.
 
Refinance to either fixed rate or FD-pegged rates, depending on your outlook on the future trend of interest rates.

You know you're loaning money from the bank and not choosing which mortgage specialist to marry right?
