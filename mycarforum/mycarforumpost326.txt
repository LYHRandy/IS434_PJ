Sorry hor..not 1%,its 2%
u selling private or HDB property..
 
It is always hard 2 sell by urself,u advertised..agents will haunt u,persuade u to let them sell.Ur house will be like a show flat,agents bring pple to view but no concrete offer.
 
A trick is always to bring the interested buyers around ur house than the agent.

for  HDB flat, just go HDB branch office to get the set of forms. Once buyers are interested, just sign the forms and mail back to HDB. Advertise, and many agts will call. Tell them you are not paying any commission, unless they sell above $XXX.

the house itself is important. 

if your house is done up nicely and have good feng shui and facing and asking not too high a price,it should not be hard to sell. 

but if your house lacks those good points and you want a high price,maybe an agent is not able to help you.

(For Private Property only, I dont know about HDBs)
 
easy, i've done it twice, once last year and once this year.
 
Speak to a lawyer who can draft you a standard option to purchase.
Usually for free on the implied terms that you will use them for the settlement of the S&P.  Legal fees cost usually about $2000 only.
 
what you do next in marketing your property is all up to you.
word of mouth, papers, internet, etc... for me word of mouth and internet is best.
 
Many agents will call. And I mean many.  (Up to now i still receive a call once in a while regarding my apt sold mid 2007!!!)
 
Best is to make known you are owner selling and need no assistance to sell.
Do give accurate information.  Meet up if you have established trust. Be professional not emotional.  Some buyers who are not professional will talk down your property. 
Leave them be.  at the end of the day, you have your reserve price, they have theirs so if it doesnt meet, no deal. very simple.
 
When deal is done verbally, request for 1% option premium. sign and give option to the buyer. Bank and clear the check immediately. He/she will have 14 days to close the deal and sort out representative lawyers.
 
After that it's the lawyers job to see to the completion. 
Just wait for completion and collect your checks/money....
 
Thats all.

Pay 1% to agent only if you have no time to meet people, discuss, etc...
Pay 2% to agent only if you have no time to meet people, discuss etc.. and are stupid

hard sell?
 
not at all for me.
 
 
 
 
There are many buyers out there who prefer to deal with owners.
I am one of them.  
 
The only thing is you must be very professional about it.
Both seller and buyer must be professional, do not lowball, talk proudly, act tough etc.  Discuss honestly and friendly.  Deals can be easily done. Be fair.
 
If one is the emotional type, cannot stay professional then it may not be a pleasant experience.
 
My experiences were pleasant, both times sold to direct buyers.

Frankly, don't waste time and effort to DIY such things. It is extremely difficult to navigate through the procedures, and the marketing efforts involved is very demanding. Property agents are there for a good reason, and the 2% comm is money well spent if it gets you the best price, minus all the administrative headaches.
 
Even if you advertised, chances are you'll get mostly property agents calling you anyway.
 
BTW, I'm not a property agent, so I have no vested interest in this. Do shortlist some agents, and interview them first, then select a sole agent. It's no point having multiple agents also, as this will tend to bring you lower prices. Just one good agent whom you can trust will do.

Property agents dont necessarily get you the best price but they will surely make sure they get the most comm out of the seller.
 
my real life account and experience:
 
i offered $1.18m for a house through an agent who had exclusive rights to sell the house.  at that point it was understood that the last offer was at $1.15mil by a lady.  However because my offer was through recommendation of another agent, the commission was to be halved with him.
 
guess how much the house was sold for ?
$1.15mil. Why? becos the exclusive agent would rather keep 1% of $1.15mil than 0.5% of $1.18mil.   so tell me using an exclusive agent will get you the best price, i pwui !

thanks. diy is a hassle but i'm trying to help sell my parent's private property. if it fetches 750 k, that is easily 15k "saved" if all goes well diy. if all goes well diy. legal paper work i think is fine as another family member is a lawyer so might as well give him the "business".

that's good and sound advise...how about for a buyer, where do we find homes that are selling direct and not via agents? is there a website that is particular popular for such purposes?

I thought buyers don't need to pay commission so they dont need to fear agents that much?

the agent working for the seller will try to get a high price for the seller so that his commission will be as high as possible as well. 
 
But who does the money come from?  The BUYER.....
 
Who is guilty of pushing prices up high?  not owners, but agents.
 
Here's another real life example although not mine.
From father's old friend who sold his semiD.
He was happy to let it go at $2 - 2.2mil after surveying market for a few months
Agent came along and told him to just advertise it for $3mil
Deal done at $2.5mil.  Sure he is happy but this caused the prices to inflate.
And also the agents commission to inflate as well.....
 
Of course there is no need to fear.
my advice as earlier, is :  be professional
