Hi bros, just wanted to find out if the new condo at BLW is a good buy or not, thinking hard...
 


 

This wonderful site next to Jurong East MRT station was tensely fought, with 12 developers vying for the 99-year leasehold land parcel. The winner should be MCL Land, they inched past their closest rival by a mere $288,000 with their top bid of $369,388,000. See what happens when you don't put ''88' in your bid? Tsk tsk...
 

The location of this condo is very very exciting. Not only is it next to the Jurong East MRT and Bus Interchange, we count five (yes five) shopping malls within a stone's throw - IMM, JCube, Westgate, JEM and Big Box. Not only that, this spot is part of the grand URA plan known as Jurong Gateway or Jurong Lake District. Can you see the potential?! The potential selling price? Find a chair and sit down first...
 

Given the total potential floor area of 523,879 sqft for this site, the cost price per unit based on the winning bid is a WHOPPING GIGANTIC TITANIC $705 psf ppr. That would mean a selling price of $1,200 to $1,300 psf. Wah piang eh! Or in internet-speak - OMFG! And we thought at $1,000 psf Lakefront Residences was already pushing the envelope. This new one would break the record for most expensive condo in Jurong! JURONG leh!

Bro, you just answered your own question.  $1,300 psf can try for older freehold condo in Holland/Bukit Timah.  Renovate to new stylish design plus internal waterworks, piping and electrical wiring also cannot be more than $100k plus, right? Ok lah, at most $200k renovation.

It's amazing the residential property of the industrial part of sgp can be so ex. 99 years lease hold somemore, I doubt got the full 99 years, at most I think around 70years left. Looks like the bubble is inflating fast.

Sure, all the amenities are nearby, but the location and environment are not very nice...
 

Crowded, congested because right smack in the middle of Jurong East.
 

Many many foreign "talents" crowd this place, especially on weekends.
 

And wait till they complete construction of the two new HDB projects nearby (can't remember the name... "sky" something??) that straddles the road that links Jurong East to Bukit Batok... can imagine traffic crawl to a standstill in this area.

There will be demand for this condo given it's proximity to alot of amenities, biz park, up and coming hub. Last but not least, lack of new condo around these area for the hdb upgraders. Even the just top caspian is now going for $1.1k psf or thereabt. If they price it right and conceptualise the theme well, it will be at least 90% sold out.....hopefully they learn from mistakes of some developers and target the correct crowd instead of trying to cash in. Build big units like 4, 5 bedroom, better still with dual key concept, sure can sell out.

I used to stay at Novena. During the SARS period, everybody ran away from Novena. Business was bad then as TTSH was the designated SARS hospital. U ask ur fren come Novena Square eat, they say u siao. U can see a lot of ppl wearing face mask walking there during that SARS period.
 


 
 

If something like SARS happen again, properties near that hospital will drop.

I think if your block can see the mrt track or station, no matter how high you stay still can hear the noise. Unless your block is located few blocks inside from the main road. I also prefer not noisy, that's why my block cannot located next to a road, bus-stop, mrt and school.    But seems like quite difficult to find such place, even can find then the block will be at some ulu place.

MRT is different from other places as there would be 4 tracks around this development. I heard Bus Interchange would ultimetely go underground as that of Boon Lay sometime soon.

To be fair, that part of Jurong is still not so bad.

not so deep into Jurong. just at the edge.
 

but buyers gotta use their brains once in a while.

dont forget the theory of relative pricing.
 

eg.  if the price of char kway teow at hawkers is $15 and the price of same Char kway teow at Hotel restaurant is $18.  Which would you pick simply?
 

the relative pricing of the different property segment is undergoing irregularities and smart buyers will be able to see that.

3.5% yield is too lar... 4% then ok.

So the asking price should be $1.7mil...
 

..

..

..

..

you did not mention the monthly maintenance fee. If it is $500 and 4% yield, fair price is $1.5mil. 

You ask too high that's why no body interested.

$1,300 psf seems reasonable. Developer not too greedy, only earning $200psf. The rest goes to land and construction.

Yada yada yada  , *yawn*
 

And I might as well sell at $1299psf so that someone grabs it immediately, right?
 

So dont talk cannon, If you have a unit like mine at $1.7mil now, I done you right here.....

Bro, sorry if I sound harsh, but if you gotta go, you gotta go, even if the hospital is 

2mins, they wanna take you also boh pian, those stay in hospital also go, no need stay near

stay in.



 
 

it's ok....diff views....one story is this ....i hurt my hand badly and bled profusely but not life threatening for an ambulance......i went to the 24hrs clinic but they asked me go hospital as there was fracture which they could not handle.....so i had to take a 10-15min cab ride to NUH A&E while blood kept dripping......
 

and as u said, if u are destined to go, no matter what happens, u still go....so even if u live nearby, doesnt mean u get sars or whatever if there's an outbreak.....

Any direct buyers wanna buy this unit pls go thru me and I share my comm with you...... 
 

By the way, last done for a similiar unit of this size on the 1-3rd floor was $1.9mill with no rental yield....also highest achieved psf is $2029 psf for a 2077sqft unit

So based on the info, this unit is considered slightly below market value. Of course we also have to take a look at the unit decor and condition...as well as facing and height...

"Market value" is merely a perceived value. Even if u give me Throttle's apartment for free I also dowan....I'll take it, then sell it to buy a seaside property, as I love the sea. Living in the city holds zero value to me.
 

Thus whether anything is "above" or "below" any value is merely perception.

My dad just sold his house for $2.78M a couple of months back. Initially the buyer only offered $2.68M. My dad said, "this is the house my children grew up in, I will not let go at a price lower than what I expect. $100K is not enough to compensate for that."
 

In the end, the house sold for the highest psf on that street, for now at least.
 

Frankly, if I had $3M, I would give it to my dad to retain my childhood memories. Isn't "value" merely perceived? :p

Yes it is always perceived.

However when it comes to such topic a more measurable mumber is determined by market in general or those who can afford and are looking to buy versus those who have and are willing to sell. So perhaps we can call it market perceived value.  Certainly Not a single unrelated person's perceived value.  
 

Likewise for cars, there is a market perceived value in dollar terms which roughly moves in tandem with the what is the last few prices done for the vehicle.
 

Such a market perceived value is determined by $$$

So we are not talking about sentimental values here.
 

Your dad can perceive the house value to be $10mil but as this is way off market value, the likelihood is that it will not be sold.  In this case his perceived value is not far off so the deal can conclude.
 

This is all not too different from stock prices.

Again we would usually strip away sentimental value when talking about market value

To add on.
 

In converse say your father perceived the value to be $1mil and the market is as efficient as it as .

Would it have been sold for just $1mil?

Most likely not.  This becos the market would come in and bid it up to what is again, the "market perceived value" or market value simply.
 

What remains then is yes a few percentage point difference made up of sentimental value.

The seller's versus the buyer's. And then the deal closes.

Well, I nvr ask you to buy his condo did I? I just laid out the facts and my conclusion is, it is slightly under market value. Market value is the current price an entity of similarity is being transacted at. Asking price is a perceived valuation of an entity.

This is my understanding, of course you can disagree.

The present site where they are building the hospital is better suited for condo ( home must be in less noisy place mah )
 

I would even think that building the hospital across Boon Lay Way next to the MRT is environmentally/access better.

MRT is different from other places as there would be 4 tracks around this development. I heard Bus Interchange would ultimetely go underground as that of Boon Lay sometime soon.



 

Buses are very very noisy, worse than MRT especially when they are starting off from a dead stop.

Bro. I would too, my gardens house, thing was, I saw no point in holding on to bad memories for myself, only when my Dad was around were memories good, rest was all sweat, blood (real blood spilled), dark corners and pain (real pain). In your instance, it would be different, no amount of money can buy back those memories. Life still goes on, holding on to memories don't pay the bills, or fund the overseas trips.   
 

I'd say your Dad made a very good and wise choice.

Across the road from IMM, alot of jazzy malls coming up.
 

Then IMM owner may have to re-brand it as a reno/warehousing hub. Who knows it may be the next private medical hub.

When you sell your hse, will you sell below market value or the price you perceive it to be worth? lets see how noble you are.....you are shooting from the moral high ground now arent you?
 

I present my thoughts, data... the buyer makes their own decision....if the data showed the hse is grossly overpriced, can I still say it's under valued?
 

Now can you present some facts and data to show that the hse is grossly overpriced?

I never say it's overpriced or underpriced. I know nuts about property. I only know that no sane agent will tell a potential buyer that a property is overpriced, shooting himself in the foot. Have u done that before, tell a potential buyer it's overpriced, don't buy? Hehe

What a Coincidence ....I just told my buyer that today....you think there's only one hse to sell in one district,  in one project?  Buyers would appreciate it if you can be honest with them and refer other leads to you. Don't be So short sighted.  Selling house is not a one off deal.
 

I prefer to lay out the facts to them and let them decide for themselves.  Maybe that's why I'm not the most successful of an agent?
