Finding it strange that is now more "affordable" to buy a condo than a flat.
 

For example, if you getting a resale flat selling 625k , asking for 35 k COV . 

You need 31.5k + 35k cash = 76.5k cash
 

If you getting a condo 1.3mil from projects that offer cash rebate for stamp fee.
 

You only need 65k cash -cash stamp duty rebate  (33.6k) = 31.4k cash.
 

No wonder, ppl are getting buying up condo in such a high liquidity environment.  .. It think absd , instead of dampen the pty mkt, it actually fuel the mkt.

Yes and no. Tho cash outlay for pte looks less, the loan quantum is double. 
 

For a first timer, it'll be silly to compete wif upgraders or the riche out there who has real $$ to spend on property and not to let ah gong pay for something either thru resale grant, cpf grant or 'subsidised' flat.

If you compare entry level condos to the resale flats in matured estate, yes, a condo is a more logical option. At least for me 3 years back. A 30+year old resale 5-rm flat was selling at $650K with 40K COV vs a brand new freehold condo at $800K. Although condo is slightly smaller, I did not have to cough out so much cash & the upside is definitely more for the condo. So the choice for me was very obvious...

Please take note that under MAS632, all cash rebates and furniture vouchers must be net off from the purchase price and you can only borrow 80% of that. Your analysis are usually good, in this case, I think it's off.

then, when you get a condo.. you need to cough out 80k.. but if there were absd reimbusement.. you only need to cough out ~38k leh. the difffferent is too hugh to ignore.. almost half of the amt of cash you need to cough out.

Yes.. it's nett off from the loan. 

But if you have enough cpf, it will means you need less cash to buy.
 

MAS should require buyer to cough back the cash rebate into the option.

got.. buy DBS shares lah.. declared dividend is already 2%.. looking at 4% this yr.

target price for the share is > $19.. now only cost $14...which is 37% appreciation.
 

If you hold for 5 yrs.. sure make more than buying property now!
 

On top of that if you are lucky.. your 1.3mil property become appreciate 10% .. you get 1.43mil on your property. 650k hdb will only be 720k.. :(

Cannot remember how much cash... But majority is from proceed selling off my 1st HDB... Still have some change for reno... That was then. Not sure about the situation now. Think the HDB that I was eyeing is at least $100K more... Condo cost probably much more...Anyway only paper gain, still need somewhere to stay...

But the $10K cap does not apply to secondary market HDB resale right?

Only new ones?

Meaning, a family earning >$20K p.m. can still buy a resale HDB - provided that they are not owning any private property?

Sorry, not familiar in this 'territory', for asking.
 

Taking the argument a bit further ... if parents were to assign their private property title(s) to their children, will the former then be deemed to be not owning any private property and therefore are eligible to buy HDB?

Re: rental yield.
 

It is in my opinion that I can get better rental yield, if I were to buy a HDB flat in D.10 - e.g. the Holland Dr flats near Holland V, or the Strathmore flats near Tanglin Rd ...

versus buying an over-priced OCR outskirts condo like Sky Habitat, or any of the far-flung shoebox units.
 

The ROI on capital and ease of renting these Holland/Tanglin HDB flats will far outweigh the condo status of these far-flung, outskirts locations.

Nowadays, proximity to MRT stations is quickly losing it's appeal, to be realistic.
 

p.s. The Buona Vista and Redhill MRT stations are both within walking distance from the Holland Dr and Strathmore flats too!

ha ha ha... got to be objective in analysis meh..cannot be bias or assume too much.. else will make mistakes..:)
 

currently reading up history of the property bubbles ard the world..

If , just if, the unemployment rate in singapore continue to be 2%.. we may have swamps of europeans coming on shore and there is actually a potential for property mtk to continue raising.. :| 
 

The current wave of property bubbles is caused by the low interest rate. The bubbles bursted when most of the mortagagor is not able to pay back e.g. USA and Spain. 

We may not see this happened in singapore in the next couple of yr given that singaporean are quite cash rich now.

For resale, if we own pte property we gotta sell it off within 6 mths after buying the hdb.

Or, reassign your private property title(s) to your children and then you'd be able to buy into HDB right?

Is there any limit to the number of HDB flats one can own (if he does not have any private property in his name)?
 

Do the current rules allow any one person to own multiple HDB assets?
 

If only restricted to one HDB flat to one name, can husband own one and wife own another?
 

Sorry for the questions, but I am figuring out ideas to circumvent existing HDB/MND rules to bite off a few cherries from the govt.

I am a Singaporean, born, bred and educated here.

I have never owned a HDB flat. Not even a HUDC, privatized or otherwise.

The last HDB flat I had lived in, was at my mother's place ... but that was many many many years ago, before I got married.
 

When we got married, we were in our early 20's, but we did not meet the HDB cap then (cannot remember what it was, but it was certainly a single-digit K then). 

Thus it was from one private property to another, from then on.
 

So sorry for asking such 'noob' questions, as I honestly have no feel at all.

Many missing condition from you pointers.
 

1.2million condo, do you know how much you need fork out from the 5 and 15% downpayment within the initial few months ?

monthly repayment btw 1.2m condo and 0.6m HDB, how many can afford 5K monthly for 30 yrs ?

what about the monthly fee $3~400 maintenance fee to the condo agent ?

HDB everything I mention is half or less than half every month...




some condo maintenance is around 3~400 every quaterly and this include one carpark. so let say 150 per month, remove 90 from carpark, left with 60. 60 for conservative charge come with free swiming pool and gym, its definitely cheaper.

hmm... i think you got me wrong.. 

I am just analysing by allowing developer to reimbuse the stamp duty,are singaporean more likely buy pte pty than resale hdb esp for those who cannot buy new hdb and not eligible for dbss/ec?
 

The cash saved from the initial payment, could be use to invest in other asset classes e.g. stock , bond. this will allow one to have a more diverse porfolio. 
 

Of course, first and foremost, 1.3mil has to be within one's acceptable loan quartum.

hdb rules  gotta ask the hdb experts here.....i onli know how to sell tau huay. 




Sorry, was just evaluating options to profit from the HDB angle, as I think it will become more & more lucrative - as the upgrader private property segment slowly moves away from the reach of upgraders ... ironic, isn't it?
 

Thus the Holland Rd & Tanglin Rd HDB areas are in my radar screens now.

I can only be sure if I am right a few years from now.

Finding it strange that is now more "affordable" to buy a condo than a flat.
 

For example, if you getting a resale flat selling 625k , asking for 35 k COV . 

You need 31.5k + 35k cash = 76.5k cash
 

If you getting a condo 1.3mil from projects that offer cash rebate for stamp fee.
 

You only need 65k cash -cash stamp duty rebate  (33.6k) = 31.4k cash.
 

No wonder, ppl are getting buying up condo in such a high liquidity environment.  .. It think absd , instead of dampen the pty mkt, it actually fuel the mkt.



 

The above is true for me.  The first property I purchased with my wife was a condo....for various reasons...but also because it COST ME LESSER CASH UPFRONT THAN COMPARED TO RESALE HBD.

you are not wrong , Jrage.
 

It does fuel the mass market segment. and thats why the first time buyer mass market segment remains quite hot.

but a buyer should not just look simply at how much he/she can down.  

an down doesnt mean can afford.  moreover nowadays cannot flip.

be careful die c0ck stand.

Re: rental yield.
 

It is in my opinion that I can get better rental yield, if I were to buy a HDB flat in D.10 - e.g. the Holland Dr flats near Holland V, or the Strathmore flats near Tanglin Rd ...

versus buying an over-priced OCR outskirts condo like Sky Habitat, or any of the far-flung shoebox units.
 

The ROI on capital and ease of renting these Holland/Tanglin HDB flats will far outweigh the condo status of these far-flung, outskirts locations.

Nowadays, proximity to MRT stations is quickly losing it's appeal, to be realistic.
 

p.s. The Buona Vista and Redhill MRT stations are both within walking distance from the Holland Dr and Strathmore flats too!




Yes, good analysis, rental yields for hdbs in mature estates and good locations are easily 5 to 8%, this is why I want to buy a resale hdb but cannot rent out for 5 years, quite meaningless for me then since I do not intend to stay in it.

OK, I wasn't aware of that 'show stopper'.

Not being able to tenant out for 5 years (even for resale HDB?) is definitely a no go.

Basically zero return in the first 5 years. Too bad, so sad.

Yes, I believe you have to fulfil MOP of 5 years even for resale flats, used to be 3 years, but I am not an agent so maybe "experts" like ASD78 or JJ5599 can clarify. Or even Ben5266.

Or, reassign your private property title(s) to your children and then you'd be able to buy into HDB right?

Is there any limit to the number of HDB flats one can own (if he does not have any private property in his name)?
 

Do the current rules allow any one person to own multiple HDB assets?
 

If only restricted to one HDB flat to one name, can husband own one and wife own another?
 

Sorry for the questions, but I am figuring out ideas to circumvent existing HDB/MND rules to bite off a few cherries from the govt.

Exactly - my original idea ... having seen many pinoy and myanmar nurses and hospital staff employed in Gleneagles / Mt Elizabeth hospitals and the specialists clinics / medical centres.

Tenanting Holland Rd and Tanglin Rd HDB flats will be a boon to them and some money-making considerations for SGeans!

dbs wanna buy indon bank. people scared indon bank is lemon    if lemon too big, no more posb to help tong  



 
 

Actually temasek has no choice but to try to sell to dbs. 

Cos' to the indo government , since dbs belong to temasek, they also see the % held by temask and dbs as belonging to temasek. 

I guess temasek just trying to avoid the same issue they had with the indo telco.. So they want to get a outright "can hold" or "cannot hold" from the indo government.
 

to me it's better that temasek sells to dbs than others.

So much hassle just to buy a hdb, I just buy a private la.
 

Anyway prenups are not fully recognized in singapore, unless you are saying get married in a foreign country and sign the pre-nup, come back and buy hdb, but as per my first statement, just too much of a hassle. And I don't like fake stuffs....

Yes, if at BTO prices, I don't mind leaving it emtpy for 5 years, but at re-sale prices not as good a value proposition. But you definitely exceed the income cap and you have to sell your house within 18 months.

Yes, if at BTO prices, I don't mind leaving it emtpy for 5 years, but at re-sale prices not as good a value proposition. But you definitely exceed the income cap and you have to sell your house within 18 months.

Hold resale HDB for 5 years? Forget it lah, no brainer.

May not even recoup capital appreciation, depending on how the market turns.

Yah that actually is my Plan-B.

Get each of them to apply for HDB, when getting married - then move into the condos that I will be assigning to each of them. 

And then later, rent out the HDB flats for income, or if HDB prices were to rise further in future, to sell them - with thanks to the HDB for the initial subsidies given!

Then they can use the capital gains for anything they'd want.

Use them for private property purchase downpayments ... here, or in Oz.

Actually here got more upsides, as we grow to 6.5m with high net-worth FTs pouring in from all over the world!
 

Just some forward planning ideas being tossed

IMO, Singaporean should buy their first HDB brand new from HDB to exercise the privillage of being s Singaporean. Rental passive income is always good but I am not so sure about capital gains. I knew of someone buying a flat and leaving it vacant for 5 years and selling it in 5 years for the capital gains.
 

Initial downpayment for condo may be lesser compared to a resale HDB but ones must also consider the overall long term commitment.

Just for information to the members of this forum...
 

it is not true to assume that the prime area will always be 9/10/11... 

In many countries , the central of countries moves according to activities setup else where over time. 

e.g. vegas was a dessert.. and the land is useless before now.
 

It is kind of wrong to assume that CCR will always give you better rental yield, greater appreciation.. and the high-end residences there will always in demand.
 

Personally , i feel like the prime location has shift from the traditional CCR to sites near the mrt. I wont be surprise in 30 yrs time. Site near the centrally-located mrt will become more expensive than CCR outskirts.
 

This is why no takers for pine grove enbloc.. cos' it's further away from the mrt.

Yup, good thoughts.

My sis did just that - bought a new flat from HDB, furnished it, but left it vacant and sold it after 5 years.

She did make capital gains, but not sure how much ... first bite of the cherry. Hehe.

Errr Pine Grove (or for that matter, Pandan Valley) was never considered CCR (D9/10 by definition).

It's D21 lah. Fringe-CCR at best.

But the postal district never lie.
 

Right at the boundary margin of D10 in that location would be setups like Ridgewoood and Trizon (formerly Himiko Court). Anything further west, will be OCR D21.

And another comment on Pine Grove.

The en-bloc-kers are literally asking for D10-FH-equivalent $psf, when they are D21 OCR, 99-yr LH (or whatever that's left) ex-HUDC.

No wonder got no takers.

Plot area is also too large and will need a JV investment proposal.

Difficult lah ... and greedy too!

there are a few successful enbloc in that vicinity coz it is a nice location. mrt is a bonus for that area but i dun believe it was a deal breaker. pine grove enbloc fail simply becoz the price quantum is simply too high as the site is too huge. very risky and difficult for any developer to swallow.

some condo maintenance is around 3~400 every quaterly and this include one carpark. so let say 150 per month, remove 90 from carpark, left with 60. 60 for conservative charge come with free swiming pool and gym, its definitely cheaper.



 

At 150 bucks per month condo maintenance fee is very very low leh. Hard to find such condos nowadays. Anyway, you have not factored in sinking fund. If you take sinking fund into consideration, it will be much more than the $150 conservancy you pay each month.

in simple terms, sinking fund goes towards the piggybank which is used for R&R works coz condo dun hv ah gong to fall back on. btw, which condo charges <$150/mth?

IMHO, the Carribean is all hype.

I went to view the sales office in 2004, AFTER TOP, when they were only 30% sold.

Still very stubborn leh, don't want to down price!

Other than the sea view, Telok Blangah Rd is full of container trucks plying to and from the PSA container ports. The viaduct above adds on to one's daily view of counting container trucks (vs sheep) to sleep!  

For 99-yr LH, I'd rather still put my money on 'traditional' CCR setups like Spring Grove for a better return.

When i was ready to buy, i already could not qualify becos the System cut me out of my birth right.

But honestly I wasnt looking to buy an HDB then.   
 

I still think it is my birth right to buy a new one direct from Govt without all these restrictions.

Am I not Singaporean holding pink IC and red Passport?

Did I not do my National Service?

Do I not pay heavy taxes?

Finding it strange that is now more "affordable" to buy a condo than a flat.
 

For example, if you getting a resale flat selling 625k , asking for 35 k COV . 

You need 31.5k + 35k cash = 76.5k cash
 

If you getting a condo 1.3mil from projects that offer cash rebate for stamp fee.
 

You only need 65k cash -cash stamp duty rebate  (33.6k) = 31.4k cash.
 

No wonder, ppl are getting buying up condo in such a high liquidity environment.  .. It think absd , instead of dampen the pty mkt, it actually fuel the mkt.



 
 

i dun see how buying a 1.3mil condo is cheaper a 625+35k HDB in any way...

My insurance company uses Mortgage Decreasing Term Assurance (MDTA), so does my (US) company - re company housing loans.
 

Tenure, vs tenor

Elevator, vs lift

I believe I had typed p.m. very clearly.

Anything less would be worrying!




Yes but I feel 30 to 40K a month is very comfortable for a 1 million loan, 3 million than a bit stretching it, I believe this is the region of the likes of many of the forummers here.

actually alot of 30 something couples, not eligible for new flats ,  has 400-600k in cpf.

Given that they earn more than 12k a mth... and more more in bonus. :P




I think it has been capped at $5000 for Cpf contribution, also max 17 mth Cpf contribution cap if I am not wrong.. So even if one earn 1 mil a year, the amount going into OA per year max at 20k.. Quite difficult to see 600k Cpf OA at age of 30+, unless one contribute extra voluntarily n company dun mind contribute more than required capped amount.
 

U got 400-600k in yr cpfoa ? If yes, I'm very happy for u..

so what.... if you can buy condo first, no need to buy any HDB in future.

why die die must buy HDB and restrict yourself?
 

I have never bought a HDB myself, life still goes on fine..




Throttle, u r one lucky chap.. I wish that I'm good enough to not own a hdb as first step to private.. But no choice as last time pay too low..

Well, the next generation is always more 'daring' than the previous.

Just hope you don't pass on your loans to your next generation!

It's already happening in some countries like Japan.

they forgot that once they buy HDB, they tie themselves down with the restrictions.




Especially the rental restriction.. So tight.. But what to do? It's leasing from Hdb anyway so the landlord sets the rule.. Well l dun care about the rule n bend the rule n still rent out the flat for the full 5year MOP until I sold it off at 6th year

FYI, there is no cap for CPF contribution for bonus .... there is a cap for monthly salary but not for bonus. So it is possible to get to 600 k CPF is they get big fat bonuses.

don't have so good deal one lah


Well other than the monthly wage contribution cap, there is another cap known as Additional Wage (AW) cap. Yup this is actually the bonus or any additional wage you might get in your job contribution cap. To make things simple it is important for you to know that your total wages subject to CPF cannot exceed $76,500 for the working year. This amount include your monthly wage and any bonuses so if you earn a monthly wage of $3,500, then the available amount subjected to CPF for your bonus will be $34,500. So unless your bonus is above $34,500 in which any amount above that limit will not be subjected to CPF.

Not true, I very bo ji actually, but I worked out that I have 500K cash and cpf, so with a QOF of 50% is quite safe, but can't find a decent 1 million property nowadays anyway.

I am not sure about bonus cap.. As far as commission as additional income is concerned, I think it's capped at additional 5 months, which includes 12 month, so it's 17 months.. This is for my case.. U have more than 30k contribution into yr Cpf OA recently?

aiyo.. i say couple hor.. 30+ ~ 30-39 yrs old.. 

Like you say if 1 person 20k a yr.. 

then, 10 yrs working x 20k x 2 person is 400k hor..

if 15 yrs working x 20 x 2 person is 600k ...
 

..  you also forget that every yr ah gong give interest also.. 

... if you make good investment.. then it will grow 5-10% a yr..
 

my cpf investment just grew 10% over the last 12 mths.. 

why cannot ?

Boss you must be joking here right? What has this got to do with the tenet of meritocracy. We are talking about getting a HDB flat not jockeying for the appointment of HDB CEO leh. 
 


 

In this instance, the concept of affirmative action is more highly appropriate.

No, not getting a $1M+ property, but taking >$1M in loans (mortgage) ... different hor.



 

the mortgage amt is not indication of the amt of reserve one has. 
 

if i have 600k cash, 400k cpf.. why shld i placed everything into the house, when the interest rate is 1++.. 

the safest bet, i put $$ in 3-5% bond maturing in 3-5 yrs.. if the interest rate raise beyond 3 , then put the cash back into the house... 
 

i think the scary ppl are those .. with 30k cash/other investment... and take up a 1 million mortagage... That's scary, regardless if he earns 30-40k  a mth..

When i was ready to buy, i already could not qualify becos the System cut me out of my birth right.

But honestly I wasnt looking to buy an HDB then.   
 

I still think it is my birth right to buy a new one direct from Govt without all these restrictions.

Am I not Singaporean holding pink IC and red Passport?

Did I not do my National Service?

Do I not pay heavy taxes?

If you are short of cash better buy cheaper option



 

bro.. of course understand lah.. i also never say i am buying?!?.. i just saying absd re-imbusement is making more "affordable" for some ppl to "jump" into the dark hole.
 

.e.g. Archipelago top in 5 yrs time..when the mrt is up.. there is absd re-imbusement.. Some idiots with little cash and a little bit more cpf.. may just purchase the 1.3 mil unit.. thinking that 5 yrs later it will appreciate.. and then he can flip...

I really admire couples who take up >$1M mortgage loans when purchasing private property here! 

Especially so, if they are not even earning anywhere near $30-40K p.m. combined ... and have no parent-sponsorship either.
 

Then they want expensive car(s), children ... yes, sometimes in that order.
 

Financially risky leh!

Exactly my point!

You should then only buy a house where you max your CPF lumpsum and the rest furnished with yr CPF monthly only. Zero cash monthly, as far as possible.

The only cash to be used will only be to satisfy the govt's minimum % non-CPF upfront ruling.

Then you are good!

Why will confirm died ? Mthly repayment for a 1 million is only 5k at 4% interest rate over 30 yrs The issue I guess is more abt whether the couple is highly leveraging .

Your boundary condition is too stretched, IMHO.

For me, one must strive to be mortgage-free by 50.

So if you're 30 now, it will be $6K payment p.m.

But if you're 40 now, that'll be $10K p.m.

That's already stretching it.

I think different. Am risk averse.

Statistics show more often than not, CPF funds used for investment lost money.

Need to cover CPF-O int and bank's mngt annual fee.

I tried it once, just after the AFC, made abt 25% gain by just parking some CPF monies for a year and then pulled out.

But never again, even though I had made good money. 

As I said, I am risk averse.

some condo maintenance is around 3~400 every quaterly and this include one carpark. so let say 150 per month, remove 90 from carpark, left with 60. 60 for conservative charge come with free swiming pool and gym, its definitely cheaper.

That's why I moved from condo to landed - to be able to park my cars and save on maintenance fee.

No joke $2,500 per quarter, with sinking fund!

Country clubs are only a short drive away.

Base on $2500 per quarter, you refer to those 5mil condo liao.

Many cars at home, you can't even stay in condo, so you got no choice lah.

Yes, the problem with condos is that there is a cap on the total number of cars one can own/park.

Of course you could do a side deal with an expat family with no car (usually the smaller units) and pay the a fee to use their allocated car park slot.

But very lehchay lah, when they are repatriated, or move out - then got to find another willing party.
 

Parking outside of the condo premises is impossible, not in D.9 - without attracting the TP.

Statistics has shown that most people lost money investing their cpf in the short run, the percentages are better when you stretch the period to 5 years at least for a diversified equity fund. Personally I find it hard to beat the risk free rate of 4+1 or 2.5 + 1 rate for the first 60K, so it's better to leave it alone even if you do not intend to use it for property. Do note that with current interest rates of less than 2 percent, technically it is also better to leave your cpf growing at a higher rate than to use it for your property. Also the acrued interest over a long period can become a substantial sum when you sell your property.

Yup, I have seen many colleagues of mine getting their fingers burnt, after they bought in a frenzy - when CPF funds were first opened to specific financial instruments.

All kpkb after that.

To me, it was their own fault - going into the equities market, 'managed' though they may be, with their eyes wide shut!

Personally I find it hard to beat the risk free rate of 4+1 or 2.5 + 1 rate for the first 60K, so it's better to leave it alone even if you do not intend to use it for property.

Do note that with current interest rates of less than 2 percent, technically it is also better to leave your cpf growing at a higher rate than to use it for your property. Also the acrued interest over a long period can become a substantial sum when you sell your property.




To me, the accrued interest that had to be returned to CPF is still your money that can be used over again in your next property purchase. It's left pocket, right pocket.

Often times (unless your timing is sway and you enter into negative equity), capital appreciation on my property purchases have been > CPF-O interest rate ... so always covered.

ya sold off most of my funds and crap stocks. well ... most ...  
 

now i only do dividend stocks to beat inflation really.  
 

Well for most youngsters nowadays, the CPF restrictions on 2nd loan +  2nd bank loan of 40% LTV is a strong deterence to those with some financial prudence

Yes, no problem to do that, in fact doing that runs you less risk of hitting the AWDL for CPF so that you need not come up with cash when you hit the limit, but I have seen those who bought in the 90s having 200K in acrued interest, quite a tidy sum...for myself I monetized the cpf monthly installment by renting out the property and using cpf to pay for installment....hehe...this is how I made some money....but now no property to rent out, so very poor....

Statistics has shown that most people lost money investing their cpf in the short run, the percentages are better when you stretch the period to 5 years at least for a diversified equity fund. Personally I find it hard to beat the risk free rate of 4+1 or 2.5 + 1 rate for the first 60K, so it's better to leave it alone even if you do not intend to use it for property.

I think different. Am risk averse.

Statistics show more often than not, CPF funds used for investment lost money.

Need to cover CPF-O int and bank's mngt annual fee.

I tried it once, just after the AFC, made abt 25% gain by just parking some CPF monies for a year and then pulled out.

But never again, even though I had made good money. 

As I said, I am risk averse.

Prefer max CPF to property ... never fails



 
 

Actually depends on your financial planning.. and your investment strategy.  How much does of your wealth consist of CPF.

e.g. 50% of your wealth (exclude own-stay property) is in CPF.. then i would think you are probably too conservative to me..

if 5% of your wealth is in CPF., then it sound perfectly fine.  

There shld always be a portion of your wealth that is a less risky mode. :) 
 

For me , CPF work out to be 50% of my wealth... so 25% of them in standing in OA acct collecting ah gong interest..While the rest is in investment. 
 

Then again.. why do i want to pay off my housing loan with CPF when the interest is <1% vs 2.5% ?

2.5% is nothing - depending on your alternative disposition!

I'd rather then maximize my cash (wealth, as you would term it) into AUD FD/savings earning up to 6% p.a. risk-free in Oz.

For me, there is little/no forex exposure, as my children are all there, the maternal side of my family are all there, and being a PR, I need to spend >1/3 of my time there anyway.
 

So max CPF to housing mortgage makes the best sense for me, with a risk aversion to CPF-related investment instruments of any kind, or even "playing" with the stock market!
 

Enjoying the best of both worlds, if I might put it that way to you.

Yah that actually is my Plan-B.

Get each of them to apply for HDB, when getting married - then move into the condos that I will be assigning to each of them. 

And then later, rent out the HDB flats for income, or if HDB prices were to rise further in future, to sell them - with thanks to the HDB for the initial subsidies given!

Then they can use the capital gains for anything they'd want.

Use them for private property purchase downpayments ... here, or in Oz.

Actually here got more upsides, as we grow to 6.5m with high net-worth FTs pouring in from all over the world!
 

Just some forward planning ideas being tossed



 

Do the reverse la - stay in HDB and rent out the condo....Condo sure rent for higher price one. 
 

Then use the rental return to finance a property overseas...

HDB is supposed to be a home to live in - not an investment. 
 

"Subsidised" housing is not needed if all you want is to make money and have somewhere else to live right?

Re: rental yield.
 

It is in my opinion that I can get better rental yield, if I were to buy a HDB flat in D.10 - e.g. the Holland Dr flats near Holland V, or the Strathmore flats near Tanglin Rd ...

versus buying an over-priced OCR outskirts condo like Sky Habitat, or any of the far-flung shoebox units.
 

The ROI on capital and ease of renting these Holland/Tanglin HDB flats will far outweigh the condo status of these far-flung, outskirts locations.

Nowadays, proximity to MRT stations is quickly losing it's appeal, to be realistic.
 

p.s. The Buona Vista and Redhill MRT stations are both within walking distance from the Holland Dr and Strathmore flats too!



 

To me a reasonable sized 2 bedroom / 3 bedroom condo in a good expat or nature area is a good bet - something already established.  
 

This is what we are going to do soon....

Its a matter of perspective and what you're giving up. 
 

I look to some of the places I stayed growing up, and also the balance now if I were to stay in Condo vs HDB. 
 

Right now, the family is perfectly happy in our HDB.  Sure it would be nicer to stay in a condo, but I look towards what I would be giving up (in terms of income) vs what I would be gaining by staying in the HDB - and I feel that I would be better served to stay in HDB and then use the "extra" income from Condo to finance other things....

I will answer this for Sabbie.

For me, HDB will never be a viable long-term investment.

I just want the 1st cherry from Govt subsidy.

Worthwhile, due to it's relatively lower initial capital outlay.

Govt give free money ... you don't want?

Then after that re-focus on private developments only.
 

My children will start young, so to ensure that they get to bite the cherry before their combined incomes hit >$10K.

We had started young too, but that time, ceiling was very low single-digit. So never had the chance.

Don't know what cherry tastes like

By the way - $650k + COV is actually really high for a HDB - for a comparable size / location condo you are probably looking at $1.5 million. 
 

My block is now selling for a little over $500k - for comparably sized condo, nearest is water town, which even that is going for about $1.3 for same size. 
 

Deposit on 1.3 million is $260,000 - and your monthly mortgage will be $4,965 per month
 

In comparison, 
 

A $260,000 deposit on a $550,00 HDB will leave you with a mortgage of $1385.00 
 

Also remember to add in the Stamp duty when calculating your upfront cash

Actually .. i have to agree that staying in some condo gives a better quality of life.. esp those crowded with middle-class singaporean. 
 

Again. you need to realised that jolie888 is comparing high-class condo in CCR and her post indicates that she is in the higher-middle or upper class of our society.. So to eating out will properly mean eating in high-class resturant.. and hawker is only for "education" purpose to her children/grandchildren.. She probably also dun need MRT and other convenience.

Many will be flocking to SG where the unemployment rate is only 2%. Whether or not these new angmo gets expats' package, it will still beat being unemployed in europe. 
 

On the other hand, i will think many chinese will be heading home.

Yep - A condo is definitely a lot better than HDB - its just a matter of exactly how much money you have. 
 

I feel its much better to be finanancially comfortable in a lesser house, and not have to worry about things like tuition fees, car payments, eating out etc, then to live in a nice condo but be having to scrimp on the other things. 
 

Or conversely I would rather live in a 5 room (110 sqm) HDB than squeeze into a 85 sqm condo (if that's the decision you are making) 
 

If course, if you can live in a big big condo, and not worry about budget - then that's the best option.  But it that's you, then you don't really have any business buying a HDB in the first place.

I am not sure if condo gives a better quality of life or not, but my experience tells me that for condo,
 

1) I feel safer for my car and my home.

2) Less chance of rowdy neighbors. My neighbours are all professionals. 

3) I got a gym to use which is improtant to me

4) Much more quiet. I hate coming back home and hear noisy surroundings.
 

However, mine is a 100++ unit type of condo. For mass ones like 600++ units and above, I think it will diverge close to HDB quality of living.

4) Much more quiet. I hate coming back home and hear noisy surroundings.
 

However, mine is a 100++ unit type of condo. For mass ones like 600++ units and above, I think it will diverge close to HDB quality of living.




you must declare which type of condo because.
 

1) when ceiling leaking, complain your neighbour they dont care about you, you also LL

2) Now aday Condo got lots of FW (not FT hor) staying inside and every weekend get all their friends to join them at the pool

3) HDB some got Gym very near

4) look at point 2

personally, i think only a very very small number of flats give better quality of life. i.e. those flat at tiong bahru. If you stay in those flat, it will only take you 10-20mins to reach office in cbd. You spend the least time on the road,compare to your colleagues, in fact even your bosses staying in D9/10/11. Then you have more family time, which is priceless..

For once I agree with you, must see what kinda condo, some condo actually more dangerous than hdb, for example when I went Melville Park to view a unit, that time I poor man cannot afford any more expensive condo, this indian kid threw something at me from upstairs! later on I found out that a lot of indians stay there and not those smart indian doctors lawyers kind and I swear never to buy a unit there.... okie this is in district 18 so cannot say...one day I went to a district 9 condo to fetch my mistress and guess what...most of the unit rented out to prcs and ah bengs with ang kongs....I guess you guys can guess that it's called pacific mansion....so not all condos necessarily better than hdb....some hdb downstairs got coffee shops, supermarkets, covered carparks, near sports complexes....so it's really quite good....and this is from a guy that never stay hdb for the past 20 years....

As I've said , an estate is only as good as the people living there.

if you got a condo filled with CMI, ratracing, wannabes, upstarts, then good luck.

(read: those who think that living in a condo is damn steady, nose high high type)

a HDB can been more harmonious and pleasant to live in.
 

My condo is probably 80% FTs (not the middle management kind) and i have no problems waving and saying hi or having a chit chat at the pool.

Talent i think is only found in singapore 




There is this Aussie joke on the Kiwis.

Now, over the last couple of decades, there have been more NZers emigrating to Oz. While the Oz govt makes it very easy for the Kiwis, the Aussies (like SGeans here) are not really in favor of it.
 

So the saying goes:

As more and more NZers emigrate to Oz, the average IQ level of BOTH countries will drop!

Funnie right?

Depends on who tells the joke.

They use the same joke against each other, I suppose.

You got it wrong. The original phrase is from Sir Rob, he said that people emigrating from NZ to Oz raises the average IQ of both countries.

No, I am afraid I did not get it wrong.

This is indeed a joke circulating round Oz on the Kiwis ... source & origin notwithstanding, Sir Rob or otherwise!
 

I see it as the Aussies' way of getting back at their neighbors.
 

Just like us and our neighbors up north.

 Well said. It all depends on the community of neighbours. Some HDB or condos are like good kampungs. While others are like ghettos, regardless if HDB or condo where residents are awful to each other, trash the place. Really ruin the neighbourhood.

this is deep. ozzies are dumber than kiwis. so when kiwis emirate to oz, average ozzie iq increase. the smarter kiwis will stay while only the dumber kiwis will emigrate to oz, the average kiwi iq increases.

Not wrong. 

Like I said, the Aussies are now using that same quip (from Robert Muldoon) and turning that same joke, with a twist, against their NZ neighbors emigrating here.

Call it unoriginal if you want ... but it's happening right here!

Prices of private resale homes inch up again
 

Straits Times

28 May 2012

By Amanda Tan
 

Prices of private resale homes inched up again in April, bearing signs that the interest in the secondary market remains healthy.
 

Overall, prices rose 0.8 per cent from March, when it saw an increase of 0.4 per cent.
 

Prices of high-end units saw a 1.6 per cent increase while that of non-central units stayed stagnant in April.
 

Only for shoebox units - measuring 506 sq ft or smaller in this case - did prices fall some 1.2 per cent. In March, this segment picked up by 2.7 per cent...
