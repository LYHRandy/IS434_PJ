After reading the several thread in mcd about condos and cluster houses.

1. Does the price of these condos and cluster houses depreciate in value on resale? eg. a 99-year condo built in 2004. if it depreciates in value then it is not wise for ppl to buy into these properties isnt it?

2. Can Sporean/PR buy these properties and still buy a HDB? (rules keep changing until i blur)

3. compare to a new 99-year or freehold condo, which will chose?

1. It depends on purchase price, prevailing mkt conditions and future market movements. in a nut shell- Depends.
 

2. Rules now ? Buy private menas cannot buy hdb. or really need to buy hdb then must dispose of private in 6 mths. 
 

3. You mean choose lh or fh is it? Again , what you want and can afford comes into play. some only want fh. but more and more do not mind 99 lh nowadays. LH is usually cheaper than FH, and a better return on rental yield. 
 

All three questions point to these : Location, price and timing.

Not a good buy. Instead better to consider a 40 year-old apt next to botanic gardens at taman serasi. $2.7m, 1410 sq. ft. Currently undergoing enbloc process with reserve price of more than $4m.

Good taste... Thats a pretty nice area to live in regardless of whether it is undergoing enbloc. A few new developments have sprung up in that area so there's huge development potential for the old apartments.

Need to find out when the land title for LH estate. Some could be 20-30yrs old but rebuild few years back.

99-yr condo is ok if it's a GOOD location. meaning sentosa, D9,10,11,15 parts of 16 and 21. if those in hdb estates, feeergeddit. 
 

Q3 if same price, the answer is obvious rite?

how about if the condo is 99 years but just above a basement MRT station?
 

like Kovan Residences. or Dorsett Residences
 

can consider good location?
 

anyway Singapore is so small, why are some "ulu" inaccessible places considered good locations? like Nassim, 6th Ave etc

It's always about Location, Location, & Location
 

Regardings to condo/HDB, with current rules private property owners need to sell your private properties within 6 months upon purchase of your HDB. If you are purchasing a HDB; you have to fulfill the MOP before you can buy a private
 

Sometimes you don't necessary have to stay at a place you own or own the place that you stay at...

This is a poorly maintained cluster terrace housing with many units and zero amenities.

Near to nowhere except the swiss club which is at least another 10 minutes walk away.

I think you are greatly mistaken

Nassim and 6th ave are NOT ulu nor inaccessible at all.
 

I somewhat regretted not buying Nassim Loft at launch becos it was leasehold.

It is a great location which is serene yet a stones throw from the action.

I should have bot it to stay.

frankly speaking, if i ever buy a condo, it has to be a ground unit with garden, or a penthouse unit. Other than that, it's just a very expensive HDB flat. Landed property is the way to go.

For max capital appreciation in the current market, stick to FH Landed in the Core Central area.

Very scarce resource and getting more scarce by the year.
 

My FH D.10 Semi-D Bungalow bought 12 years ago has appreciated by 500% (yes, 5 times its value, since I bought it) and still going up!!!

So true, Land Acquisition Act take place, be it FH/LF/999 also useless. Anyways what's the probability of one staying for more than 99yrs in the same place? It all boils down to location, so what if FH but lousy location and not accessible? Useless.

I have to disagree on the statement that condo is just a very expensive HDB. 
 

1. HDB don't have security guards. Even slack guards are better than none.

2. Your visitors must put coupon in HDB apart from Sun/PH but condo parking is always free 24/7.

3. HDB doesn't have private facilities like gym, pool, bbq, ktv, tennis court, jacuzzi etc...

4. The privacy feel is very different from living in HDB
 

If everyone thinks that condo is just an overpriced HDB theory is true, then many developers would have gone bust and SG would only consists of HDB and landed properties. In a nutshell, you get what you pay for.

You must be a HDB heartlander, or someone living in the 'Outskirts' / East Coast / North.
 

Nassim, Dalvey, Cairnhill, Tanglin, Holland, Grange, 6th Ave, etc. are in what is termed as the 'Central Core District'  of Singapore ... where most of the GCBs (Good Class Bungalow) and super-prime condos are also located ... in what used to be called Districts 9 and 10 of Singapore.  
 

That's where all the action is!
 

So if you are from 'Swa Teng' Singapore, you probably won't know lah.

I looked at Nassim Loft too, actually twice, before its TOP.

Recall it came with good branded fixtures like bulthaup/Gaggenau kitchen, Duravit sanitaryware and Hansa faucets ... all German.

Likewise, did not transact, due to it being 99 LH.
 

But based on an American colleague who has been renting for 2 years ... should have bought it for rental.  

The yield's pretty good, so's the location.

IMHO, Nassim is but one of the best locations to have a house in Singapore.

Walking distance from Orchard Road, yet secluded / blocked from all the hustle and bustle.
 

I believe Nassim Jade was in the news many years ago ... relating to MM's or PM's purchase (?).

The converse is true. Too much riff raff, noise and crowds near an MRT station.
 

Best to be a short drive or walk from the happening places but still dang hard for others to find your house. If I stayed in the Leedon, Holland area; I would be cursing at the new MRT line. 
 

And I think my favourite part of the Botanics (which is usually secluded) will soon be overwhelmed with the new MRT station there!

thanks for your explanation and your thinly veiled insult at a HDB heartlander like me, by your presumptous thought that a heartlander would know no better.
 

so by just saying they are termed Central Core District means that they are in good locations is akin to an analogy that a BMW is good because its considered a luxury brand and most rich people drive one.
 

to me a BMW is well built, it drives well and it has a great tradition. that makes them what they are.
 

which precisely my question is why locations like nassim and 6th ave are designated Central Core in the first place? whats the criteria to qualify as a good location what makes the locations of these areas special to be accorded that status? 
 

btw i am not staying in any of the locations that you presumed me to be. 
 

from my MBR i see fireworks at Sentosa every other day, i see the lights at Jurong Island at night. i see Bukit Timah hill and Orchard and the city from my living room. nothing much to shout about as its still an HDB, but its something that i have which i paid for with hard work.
 

i salute your apparent accomplishments in life but i think you should treat people with some humility and respect and not brush people off with catalog answers which anybody can get via URA.
 

thank you and happy LNY.

Dude, check out their location on the Singapore map.  

Nassim is right in the middle. In the heart. Central core.

i think that needs no explanation?
 

Secondly, while it is in the heart, it is still so close to nature as though nestled in an enclave of its own.

It is serene and highly accessible.  It is also of low population density. thus its high demand leading to high price.

No prob,  i agree that there are many spots on Central Core which I wont put money on. 
 

and quite often the best places to stay may not be the best places to invest and vice versa.

It all depends on what you buy the property for.

Suburban mass market condos will drop easily to about $800psf within the next 2 years.
 

Currently those left to buy are upgraders who have to take on a larger debt than they already have now.   plus, so much supply coming. you dont touch, I dont touch, foreigners dont touch, where do prices go from here?
 

An overall 20% decline across all category in the next 2 yrs is the ideal result which the Govt are trying to acheive.

900 plus sq ft is decent size, and the price is alright.  If you can't afford that quantum, you should settle for smaller units hence lower quantum.

I am certain that the days of $800 psf are gone.  Even though there are more measures are in place but it only affects speculators and not genuine buyers.  There will always have genuine buyrs or buyers with strong holder power.

genuine buyers dont make up enough numbers.

thereason why prices moved up is not becos of user buyers but becos of investor buyers and speculator buyers.

investor buyers and speculator buyers dont like a sticky cashflow.
 

by the way, the subject is private properties not HDB.  HDB price movement is affected more by real demand.
 

in case you dont know, there are plenty of condos although not brand new which are under $800psf.

you looking to buy?

If buy for rental then its all about location and surrounding amenities. LH or FH --> doesn't matter

I agree.  Generally, those near MRT stations with shopping centres will fetch good rental yield as demand is usually strong.

genuine buyers dont make up enough numbers.

thereason why prices moved up is not becos of user buyers but becos of investor buyers and speculator buyers.

investor buyers and speculator buyers dont like a sticky cashflow.
 

by the way, the subject is private properties not HDB.  HDB price movement is affected more by real demand.
 

in case you dont know, there are plenty of condos although not brand new which are under $800psf.

you looking to buy?




Ya lor. Mine, FH some more. Still $750 only. Far from City la. But, I tried before. Suntec city to my home in only 15minutes.   Ok.. I am speeding.

The report says, they sold 20+ units out of 50+ units on offer on Saturday. So the demand is still good but not fantastic.

I think 99 years LH condo can buy..as long as have at least 75 years lease left.  My first preference would be to buy FH or 999 years LH.

if they are larger units for own stay, whether mass mkt or not, genuine demand will always be there. 
 

if they r smaller 1-2brm units in hdb locations, i wonder who are these "upgraders" and what they plan to do wif the units given the potentially low yields since i can't imagine any family "upgrading" to a 600-800sf unit (unless they are currently staying in a 1rm or rental hdb flat which is unlikely the target mkt anyway). 
 

if its a shoebox unit and ppl are hoping to make a quick buck, good luck to them.

not really. i'd rather stay in a 5-rm HDB comfortably (both size-wise and monetary-wise) than squeeze into a tiny pte pigeon hole unless the trade-off is that the smaller unit is located in prime locations like orchard, sentosa or new downtown. if it's a small 99-LH condo in a hdb-estate, i dun realli see the point.

You think they want to spend money on condo in HDB estate if they can help it? The answer is simple, they are priced out of central districts condos already.  Last time cheap don't want to buy but keep waiting, now price reach new highs then want to buy.

std 4rm flat is abt 90sq.m which is ard 970sf. many condos are bigger than that. in fact, for a 3-brm condo 1100sf considered cramped liao.

Cannot say like that, rich man got rich man's aspiration, poor man got poor man's aspiration.
 

Many heartland upgraders see the transition from 5 rm HDB to 2 bedder mass market condo as a kind of validation of their existence. To them, it provides an opportunity to show that they have surpassed the Joneses, and have some people to look down on.
 

singapore is a society where people like to look down on other people on the level below them, regardless of strata.

HDB conservancy charges for 5room $60+, carpark 90+ so is $150.  No facility and guards.

But for pee, throw paper etc...i believe have but cleaner 's pay better so more on the ball. Ah Long I heard have but hush hush and guard will be on the ball. My friend's condo even have robberies lor..

But still safer than HDB as Guard helps to a certain extend...

don't need to look down on other people.

I would like to bring up a point. Some buy condo as their income exceeds the ceiling set by HDb by a fraction. They can only afford the mass market condo and worst still, the smaller 2-3 br units. For a difference of 100k+, would u buy a resale HDb or new mass market Condo?

I do know a couple of ppl who did juz that: move from 1400sf 5-Rm flat (old type) to a 900sf 2brm condo within the same hdb estate in the name of "upgrading". The initial euphoria was soon replaced by real problems such as a lack of space. Quality of life degenerated and they eventually sold off the small condo and move back to a hdb and are happier now. 
 

If one is gonna "upgrade", do a proper one. Nothing wrong wif buying a condo in a hdb estate as everyone has different aspirations and depth of pockets; juz dun go and buy something smaller than their extg hdb flat. That's truly pointless.

depends on the family's needs. if one has 2.5 kids, a grandmarder or grandfarder plus a maid and relatives that occasionally like to bunk over, buying a smaller and more expensive 2brm condo instead of a cheaper and bigger hdb is simply   .

Before we drift into infinite possibilities. I would like to assume that married couple with kids buying 1st house is rare. Couples that find their soulmates later in life , 30s which will see a likely corresponding higher combined income is becoming the norm. Fact that people ate getting hitched later.

I think people do like to show off in general.
 

I mean if you have money, what should you buy to show off?
 

Cars is for the TRUELY rich where money/depreciation no longer matters. 
 

Seriously, sometimes there is NO REASON for paying the premium other than to show off.
 

You ask why people pay 1mil for a smaller condo unit in the same hdb location?? At least a condo has some facilities, security, etc.
 

Why don't you ask why people pay 100x for a watch that tells the same time and have TOTALLY no use other than show people that you can afford an expensive watch?

It is easy to spend money if you have it. What separates the "great" people, are those that can control their urge to spend.
 

That having said, we cannot assume people who upgrades to condo are "show off". This is over generalizing.

in a corporate acquisition, if company A's share is worth $1 apiece, company B may pay $1.50 to acquire it. the premium is for this intangible factor called "goodwill". 
 

the same reasoning can be applied to all the things we buy. don't ask why why why people pay premiums because humans are complex and we can never understand them because we are not them. just like i couldn't understand why buyers for my FIL's putehs or meroboks are willing to pay a few k for a bird but i accept their choice.
 

so don't think so much la.

wanting something better in life is natural. same as cars lah. why buy beemer, merc, audi when a camry or teana will oso get u there wif relative comfort? 
 

but why i dun get is when the ppl buy a condo for the sake of "upgrading" when it's obvious that there will be compromises. i mean, it's like mr.tan ah kow who drives a ubiquitous toyota wish becoz he has the whole family in tow but decides to buy a golf as a way of "upgrading" becoz he can't afford anything above $100k.
