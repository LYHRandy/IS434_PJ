Yahoo news: Singapore's Home Prices Need to Cool Further: Deputy PM
 
Singapore's longest stretch of property price declines since the global economic crisis may not be sufficient to encourage a relaxation in housing curbs, according to Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam.
 
Shanmugaratnam, who is also the finance minister, said the government can never get rid of cycles in the real estate market, which it will help cool with housing measures.
 
Shanmugaratnam said: "There is some distance to go in achieving a meaningful correction, after the sharp run-up in prices in recent years.
 
"We can never get rid of cycles in the property market, with the upswings in some years being followed by corrections. Our cooling measures cannot eliminate the cycle, but they aim to temper it.
 
"What this means is avoiding a bubble during the upswing and allowing for a correction in prices subsequently," the minister added.
Alan Cheong, senior director of real estate research at Savills in Singapore, told Bloomberg: "The government is signalling that the measures will be in place for a while longer. The curbs may start being rolled back after two to three quarters or maximum in a year."
 
Last week, National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan said it was still not the right time to terminate the government's cooling measures and that there was still room for prices to moderate.
 
Private home prices on the island dropped 0.7% in the three months to September, marking the fourth straight quarter-on-quarter drop, and bringing the slide over the past twelve months to about four percent.
 
Most Expensive City
 
Singapore has become the most expensive city in the world to live in following a rise in house prices after an influx of foreign workers boosted the island state's wealth and demand for homes.
 
According to a February Economist Intelligence Unit report, titled The Worldwide Cost of Living Survey, a strengthening of the Singaporean dollar also pushed the country to pole position as the expansion of the financial industry contributed to the country's wealth.

So............... they knew that the influx of FW & FT boosted the price of homes. 
 
Still tolling the ideal of 6.9 million ....

I think we have to be realistic.
 
Firstly, the government has said the cooling measures will be here for a while. That is what home buyers want, right? So that's one thing they got right already.
 
Secondly, it will never be that the government will engineer a crash. They don't have the ability to do that alone and it is not a good thing. What they want is an orderly decline in prices. I'm sure they rolled out the measures with that in mind, just that perhaps the decline is not happening at the speed they had hoped. Should they then roll out even more measures? Don't forget, these policies are not suka-suka can roll out then remove then roll out then remove. That will create confusion in the market.
 
So please, don't oppose or criticise for the sake of criticising. Give credit when due. The current prices may not be as low as certain individual's expectations, but the governnment is not here to satisfy any single person. You may feel what is done is insufficient, but that is a world of difference from feeling that what is done is wrong.

I agree with you but $300+k for a 4 room flat of 85 sq/metrs isn't high ?
 
Its take a newly wed couple 25 ~ 30 yrs to replay the loan meaning they simpily cannot retire at 55 but instead work to 62 ~ 70 yrs...

A home is a necessity to common people. A car is not.

I'm not saying it is high or not high. All I am saying is that the government are taking action and I don't think those action can be said to be wrong.
 
And this thing about needing x number of years to repay a loan - my immediate reaction is, "Really?". There are so many assumptions built into the projection of how many years it takes to repay the loan, including that the couple's pay will stay stagnant. That is usually not the case. Even if it is, shouldn't the couple take some responsibility for it? And will the couple stay for the whole 25 to 30 years? When the couple has the flat, they will be immediately on the other side, they'd wish the price will go up because they already have the flat. That is human nature.

considering that HDB is a giant debt bubble, im not sure how beneficial it is for our future... all it takes is another prolonged asian crisis like 1998-2003 n we r farked... but that may not happen.. finger crossed
 
 
take SERS for example, they give us $ to buy another place, but in the end most of us still must take loan to afford that new place... perpetually in debt...

Summary, they will continue to keep the existing cooling measures, like ABSD, etc and the market will correct itself ..
 
Hmm... looks like more and more ppl are on standby with cash to catch the fallen property prices.

Now is like brinkmanship between developer and buyer. See who brink first.
 
But the unfortunate victims are those whose BTO flats are coming and they need to dispose their existing flats. This group really in trouble as buyers are not buying. And if their selling price keeps going down, they may end up not able to pay for their BTO after selling their existing units. Really headache.

If govt stop people from making money from HDB now, there will surely have another group of unhappy people demanding for the rights.

Those who can buy BMW, u think their combined income is $8k??? Can buy lor, got rich father or sugar daddy mah.
 
 
Here, we are talking about young families with combined income less than $8k. And who are they? The common people..
 
You want to use sentosa cove to say that BTO are cheap???

Combined $8k.
CPF portion can be used for housing is about 30% = $2400.
Half million loan at 2% over 25 years, monthly payment is only $2100 nia.
HDB is cheap!
We should rally govt to cut the combined income to $6k or $5k for first time BTO. Then will really pull the price down.
 
$8k income, take home is $6.4k.
BMW is $2k monthly.
Still got $4.4k for the couple.
Life is good in Singapore!
 

 
 
Mostly or 90% using car loan. 
 
I want to drive one also can, $1850/- per month niah for only 10 years life.... 
 
But housing is there for at least 30 yrs... 
 

Congrad.

I agree with you but $300+k for a 4 room flat of 85 sq/metrs isn't high ?
 
Its take a newly wed couple 25 ~ 30 yrs to replay the loan meaning they simpily cannot retire at 55 but instead work to 62 ~ 70 yrs... 

Haven't you realized that this is exactly the purpose of making HDB prices high, and holding back the CPF payout?  To force both husband and wife to work till they die..... then no need to worry about funding them during their retirement years.
 
Retirement age already increased from 55 to 62 to 65 to 67, and eventually they will be able to predict when one will die and just implement retirement age = D-3yr.

I think we have to be realistic.
 
Firstly, the government has said the cooling measures will be here for a while. That is what home buyers want, right? So that's one thing they got right already.
 
Secondly, it will never be that the government will engineer a crash. They don't have the ability to do that alone and it is not a good thing. What they want is an orderly decline in prices.
 

 
wah, decline to what level considered done.
 
A pilot can take a plane down from 30,00ft to land smoothly, repeatedly, no sweat.
 
Hope, the plan for property cooling is as predictable.

  becareful what you ask for. Some of the measures they had implemented during MBT's time caused property to chiong instead of falling. For example SSD; do you really think prices will be lifted if ppl are no longer bound by SSD and will be able to sell at a lower price? LOL. SSD was couter productive and will still be in time to come.
 
For example:
 
I bought a 1m property in 2013. After holding 1yr the SSD chargeable should be 12%. So to sell my property at a breakeven price, I would need to sell it for at least 1.12m (disregarding the miscellaneous fees). If SSD is removed today, I would only have to sell it at 1m. In a declining market today where transaction volumes are thin, do you think I can still die die demand 1.12m? Or would I drop to 1m and quickly cut loss? LOL
 
The net effect of lifting some CMs is further cooling. Thumbs up to Tharman!
 
Advise to the minority property investors: don't rush in now and wait for the CMs to be removed

Read my post above. Whatever caused prices to chiong when implemented will also cause prices to fall when removed. The reverse is also true so it depends on which CM they remove. But for now, it's safe to say MIW won't be removing any of them to prevent volitility in the market.

No it's not their rights. Investments bound to have ups n downs. They had their fair share of earning liao, then they should roll this earning to benefit future gen, otherwise it's not sustainable.

Money has got to come fr somewhere, be it foreign worker or consumer. My limited understanding now would be that money is just a form of resource having somewhat the same nature as natural resources - we have to adhere to sustainable practice. So Richie rich has to practice giving back to society.

I do agree with your points.
 
In Singapore's context, increasingly high property prices mainly benefit the rich.
 
If this country is a state, like Malacca, or Jarkata, it is more justifiable, as there are poorer states to move out to if the young chose not to join the rat race.
 
However, we have no such places here.
 
Whatever the investors make now, it is at the expense of the future generation of less well off Singaporeans, or people who cannot escape this 'Paradise'
 
I would genuinely support low cost public housing, where it does not float at 100% with market prices. Income restrictions would apply here.
 
For peeps in the middle class, a tiered subsidy method for ECs should be applied, where they earn well, but not enough to be unburdened by increasing free market housing prices.
 
EC prices will be required to float with the free market. And instead of a figured subsidy, Eg. 50k for first tier, 100k for second tier, a percentage of the buying price should be used. eg .5% for first tier, 10% for second tier.
 
When there is a sale, then the % rebate would be required to be paid back to the government like the CPF.
 
Look at the ABSD cooling measure... it is so effective because it is tiered, and a percentage, instead of a numerically figured rate.

So you are right.
Those who invested in the 70's, 80's would have made loads of money and they should roll they earning to their next generation.
They sould not expect to keep their earning and expect their next gen to make the same windfall.
 
New citizen, who just landed here would have to pay the new price without past earning.
 
 
actually... those who invested in private property in the 70's 80's made much more than those who got HDB.

Most definitely so.  
 
Say you buy a private landed house in the mid 70s to late 70s, how much would it be worth today?  I know some bought their houses at around $100,000 in the late 1970s.  Today worth $2 to $3 mil.

Yes!!! In the meanwhile, older generations will continue to vote for white party because they are comfortable with an inflated asset. Whereas younger generations has to suffer and labor for it. This has a detrimental effect on the future generations.
 
The older generations can pass on their wealth to their children to soften the impact of rising cost of living but that cannot be totally relied on. How many of you hope your parents will pass on sooner in order to inherit their property and money? On the other hand, what if you do not get the inheritance? Inheritance is a bonus, not a requirement. There are many families with young parents who are not able to contribute much to soften the impact of rising costs. Older generations need a roof over their heads too.
 
Whatever it is, runaway property prices that mismatch current income level is a bad thing. Older generations should wake up and spare a thought for their future generations! Stop thinking just about yourself and your appreciating asset. I feel sad when ppl just think about how much they can make from selling or renting their properties in future because they have forgotten that their children are the future buyers/tenants, thus unintentionally passing on the burden to them. As a parent, if you just think about earning from your property, wouldn't your children think the same and hope to see you pass on sooner? You can't blame your children for that since everything is getting more expensive relative to their pay, and little wonder why children today are less filial.

KL cannot can move to other parts of Pahang. Pahang also cannot then go thatch a hut in the jungle. MY is big and don't have to stay in KL if you can't afford. But in SG, you will move to Tengah in future. But it's not ready, the farms and forests need to be cleared first. So in the meanwhile, LLST and pay up.
 
The difference is other countries are far larger and have their suburbs or so called country side. But in SG, everywhere is a city and everywhere is high cost.

We can still take public transport to reach other parts of Singapore. Yes it may take 2 hrs + but we'll still get there in time.
Try taking public transport in pahang?
 
The government builds HDB in all parts of singapore. U can live in the east, west, north, even central (if u can afford). U may not get to stay in River valley but u can still choose tiong bahru (if u can afford). 
If u no money, go stay sembawang or yew tee or Tengah lor (yes it's sibei ulu, i agree too).
 
The main issue now is the COST. After selling flats for several years at an increasingly high price (WHICH WAS A BIG MISTAKE), they reversed and lowered it down slightly. They can't go back to 90s and early 2000s prices for pissing off an entire generation of voters (after all singapore is still a democracy, yes limited but still got democracy).
Hopefully they will recognise this and keep the prices as close to this state for the next 10-15 years at least. 
 
Sometimes if u make a mistake, it's not to go back to the drawing board and just restart all over again (a clean slate doesn't exist in real life). You have to slowly try to ameliorate the effects of the mistake.

Yes, COST is the main issue. Other than that, SG is a much better place than all our neighbours. But I can't agree on "ulu" since Singapore is so small, prices are more or less as expensive wherever you go. In other countries, their suburbs can be very isolated and prices can be a few hundred % cheaper. In SG, cheap sembawang also not that cheap lar. 300k HDB compared with 500k HDB cheap meh? In MY, if you're poor like sh** you can thatch a hut for free even when a condo in KL costs a few hundred k. My point is other countries have alternatives but Singapore doesn't so prices should not runaway from average income levels.
 
Yes, I agree they can't go back to a clean state. I know they are doing something. But should they be praised for making a mistake then correcting it? I doubt so. They make a mistake, we die. They correct their mistake, we also die. Jialat liao lar, now we have to live with their mistake! If there's anyone to praise, I would praise Tharman for not being afraid to correct PAP's mistake (a moderator indeed). Tharman for PM!

Also, the current system of subsidizing poor families does not work. Why? Ok so $1000 can afford a HDB flat. But without isolation, living with your peers make you feel like an absolute looser. Walk out of your 2br HDB you see other ppl live in condo, eat at restaurant and use iPhone while you have nothing and just a 2br flat? One living on top can hardly understand the feeling of the poor. Best thing to do now is to moderate prices! Subsidy is needed but prices also have to come down. For that, Tharman has done a good job sticking to fundamentals. Hope the same mistake is never repeated again... but with 6.9m still the target, it's hard pressed to believe so.

Haiz.......when prices were high,  ppl kpkp. Now something is done to correct the market with cooling measures,  ppl kpkp.
 
When houses were sold at huge profits,  who pocketed the profits? Isn't it citizens who saw the opportunity to be greedy and kept up up their selling price and end up either into bigger housing debt with new longer loan repayments when they should be happy with that one roof instead of getting a pricier house?  Then when govt stepped in to prevent a balloon waiting to happily shock those still flip flip flop, its the govt's fault, as usual. 
 
We are blessed with at least the basics like a roof and yet there are those who say it's too flat, must be angled or slopping roof better still if studded with gold or diamonds.
 
There are more young ppl and families getting their BTOs or resale now at prices they can afford. How much is affordability is subjective and seriously the speculators are kept at bay till the next circle creeps up.
 
I am personally happy that the right small thing is done now. Could be better ways? Of cos! Everyone has an idea or threes of what is better. I think it is better for everyone to have a roof over their head that they will stay in till death. That way, no need to worry abt high or low prices.

There are more young ppl and families getting their BTOs or resale now at prices they can afford. How much is affordability is subjective and seriously the speculators are kept at bay till the next circle creeps up.
 
I am personally happy that the right small thing is done now. Could be better ways? Of cos! Everyone has an idea or threes of what is better. I think it is better for everyone to have a roof over their head that they will stay in till death. That way, no need to worry abt high or low prices.
 
Just my thoughts.....Hehe.
 
good weekend guys and safe ride.

There are 2 sides to a coin ...
 
For every policy, there will be likes and dislikes...
for every housing / property policy, someone will like, and someone will dislike...
 
There will never ever be a policy that please everyone, cos everyone of us have our own agenda to take care of...
This is life and this is fact :))

Whatever it is, runaway property prices that mismatch current income level is a bad thing. Older generations should wake up and spare a thought for their future generations! Stop thinking just about yourself and your appreciating asset. I feel sad when ppl just think about how much they can make from selling or renting their properties in future because they have forgotten that their children are the future buyers/tenants, thus unintentionally passing on the burden to them. As a parent, if you just think about earning from your property, wouldn't your children think the same and hope to see you pass on sooner? You can't blame your children for that since everything is getting more expensive relative to their pay, and little wonder why children today are less filial.
 
Please lah, if the old folk can hold on to a higher value property, why count on the kid? This should be the way and it is not selfish, the old can hold on to something and support themselves.
 
And dun say old vote for p8p just due to the property value, when they appreciate what they have benefited, it is their right to show their appreciation. If you not happy ask the current generation to do something, everything also want the old generation to take care and change for you.

Yes, COST is the main issue. Other than that, SG is a much better place than all our neighbours. But I can't agree on "ulu" since Singapore is so small, prices are more or less as expensive wherever you go. In other countries, their suburbs can be very isolated and prices can be a few hundred % cheaper. In SG, cheap sembawang also not that cheap lar. 300k HDB compared with 500k HDB cheap meh? In MY, if you're poor like sh** you can thatch a hut for free even when a condo in KL costs a few hundred k. My point is other countries have alternatives but Singapore doesn't so prices should not runaway from average income levels.
 
Yes, I agree they can't go back to a clean state. I know they are doing something. But should they be praised for making a mistake then correcting it? I doubt so. They make a mistake, we die. They correct their mistake, we also die. Jialat liao lar, now we have to live with their mistake! If there's anyone to praise, I would praise Tharman for not being afraid to correct PAP's mistake (a moderator indeed). Tharman for PM!

 
Honestly, if you can survive with RM3K and never curse and swear the govt, and happy with the basic infrastructure, healthcare that they provide, you have no alternative but also end up dead without anyone notice, worse die in hospital cos they probably let you die along the corridor without giving you any alternative.

So you are right.
Those who invested in the 70's, 80's would have made loads of money and they should roll they earning to their next generation.
They sould not expect to keep their earning and expect their next gen to make the same windfall.
 
New citizen, who just landed here would have to pay the new price without past earning.
 
 
actually... those who invested in private property in the 70's 80's made much more than those who got HDB.
Probably that y the angmo came out w csr concept, benefitting community, business n environment.So then, is it the future generation's right to demand the earnings to be accorded to them in proportionate amount.

Haiz.......when prices were high,  ppl kpkp. Now something is done to correct the market with cooling measures,  ppl kpkp.
 
When houses were sold at huge profits,  who pocketed the profits? Isn't it citizens who saw the opportunity to be greedy and kept up up their selling price and end up either into bigger housing debt with new longer loan repayments when they should be happy with that one roof instead of getting a pricier house?  Then when govt stepped in to prevent a balloon waiting to happily shock those still flip flip flop, its the govt's fault, as usual.

Whats wrong with property cycles?
 
Cycles are good. Just buy when its low and sell when its high. 
 
The problem with people is they see others buying a bigger place and they
 
also must buy a bigger place and that causes the cycles.
 
Then the price comes down and they complain.
 
Having a mortgage that is 25 or 30 years is not a problem at all.
 
The only problem is when prices rise so fast people cannot
 
even put down a deposit and the price goes up again like in China.
 
Paying interest for the next 30 years is also not a problem.
 
Inflation will just eat up the interest. If someone has 1 million 30 years ago.
 
Do you think they are smarter to put that money in the bank or buy a million

I agree, please start with new HDB price slashing by another 40%. Than I say, "You The Man" 
 
HDB can stay at current sq/meters but price of 4 & 5 rooms slash ... 
 
 
Yahoo news: Singapore's Home Prices Need to Cool Further: Deputy PM
 
Singapore's longest stretch of property price declines since the global economic crisis may not be sufficient to encourage a relaxation in housing curbs, according to Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam.
 
Shanmugaratnam, who is also the finance minister, said the government can never get rid of cycles in the real estate market, which it will help cool with housing measures.
 
Shanmugaratnam said: "There is some distance to go in achieving a meaningful correction, after the sharp run-up in prices in recent years.
 
"We can never get rid of cycles in the property market, with the upswings in some years being followed by corrections. Our cooling measures cannot eliminate the cycle, but they aim to temper it.
 
"What this means is avoiding a bubble during the upswing and allowing for a correction in prices subsequently," the minister added.
Alan Cheong, senior director of real estate research at Savills in Singapore, told Bloomberg: "The government is signalling that the measures will be in place for a while longer. The curbs may start being rolled back after two to three quarters or maximum in a year."
 
Last week, National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan said it was still not the right time to terminate the government's cooling measures and that there was still room for prices to moderate.
 
Private home prices on the island dropped 0.7% in the three months to September, marking the fourth straight quarter-on-quarter drop, and bringing the slide over the past twelve months to about four percent.
 
Most Expensive City
 
Singapore has become the most expensive city in the world to live in following a rise in house prices after an influx of foreign workers boosted the island state's wealth and demand for homes.
 
According to a February Economist Intelligence Unit report, titled The Worldwide Cost of Living Survey, a strengthening of the Singaporean dollar also pushed the country to pole position as the expansion of the financial industry contributed to the country's wealth.

We are in a tropical climate country. As long as the buildings are dedicated for Winter, its going to be expensive.
Example: almost everyone needs to install air-conidioning to achieve 25 degrees indoor (day and night).

Haven't you realized that this is exactly the purpose of making HDB prices high, and holding back the CPF payout?  To force both husband and wife to work till they die..... then no need to worry about funding them during their retirement years.
 
Retirement age already increased from 55 to 62 to 65 to 67, and eventually they will be able to predict when one will die and just implement retirement age = D-3yr. 
Wow first time read D-3 year. If this is the formula then I only have 3 yrs to " enjoy" my CPF ?If this is true, our mathematician scholars really know how to "Count Dead Straws". Sng Kau kau..

How to satisfy everyone's greed and envy and yet at the same time allow younger generation to buy affordable housing? Headache

Last time less people have the means n r less informed / educated, this time info is more easily avail n people r more informed / educated. 
There needs to be a significant chg in investment methodology or policy to counter ill effects of herd syndrome that causes bubbling. Controlled inflation / return may be one way.
Otherwise, we may b looking at or hoping for stagnation of housing prices for the next 2 decades.

in life when there is a winner there will be a loser.....somebody needs to lose for someone else to gain....in stock..in property and in business. Even in toto and 4d the winners actually takes the money from those who bought but didnt win. Best is not involved or just buy what one can afford not what one thinks that he can afford......but then its quite difficult to resist the temptation of making big bucks in the shortest time possible.

Best is not involved or just buy what one can afford not what one thinks that he can afford......but then its quite difficult to resist the temptation of making big bucks in the shortest time possible.Bro, its depends on what you mean by win or lose. 
It is mathematically, theoretically, and realistically possible for everyone to make money.
This is especially so for the property market which is base on valuation.
On the flip side, What this means also is that, it is possible for everyone to lose money.
 
In fact, it is exactly becos in recent times everybody made money from properties as valuation stayed high. So the next buyer continued to gain. Nobody lost. (Whether on paper or otherwise)  However once sentiments turn and valuations follow, not everybody will make.  This scenario is already in play as several folks liquidate with losses.
 
People often overlook that if one can make big bucks in a short time, one can also lose big bucks in that same amt of time.
 
Anyway, my bet is there will be many more losses to come. 
And my bet has a very good historical track record.
 
Heh

We can't run away from space being a premium like what you said. In cramped Singapore, that's a reality. Trying to ignore that fact is just being an ostrich. 
 
For better or worse, if you're poor in Singapore. U buy a 2 room or max 3 room flat. That's why there's the 5k limit on the nonpremium BTO 3 room flats.
 
I don't really know how much a 2 room flat really costs if u qualify for the the additional grants. At least there are grants available.
 
On a sidenote, I think Tharman will be considered too old when LHL steps down. Singapore likes their PM to stay at least for 10 yrs. Frankly other than Tan Chuan Jin, who else"looks" the part. Kee chiu looks silly at times. Heng swee keat is destined for at least DPM role? But he's also on the older side.

mark my word.... if the HDB price slump, the whole nation will kpkb again.
 
Its not as simple as many think. Many Singaporean throw in their entire life savings into HDB. Even with ultra low interest rates. The gross investment into the HDB will be easily 50% more than the purchase price after adding in 20 to 30 yrs worth of interest rate. So, those people already owned a HDB  will suffer like mad and and their retirement plan will be affected.
 
Best approach will be stabilising the current pricing and let it grow at a minimal rate to ensure that the investment into HDB is sufficient to cover the interest rate.

A lot of people say we should sell cheap flats to young couples.
 
When a person sells their 3 room flat to upgrade to a bigger flat
 
they are most welcome to sell at a lower price to a young couple.
 
But how many people choose to sell to a young couple at a price
 
below market price? Everyone will just sell to the highest bidder.
 
Very easy to say should sell cheap flats to young couples but how
 
many people actually do it when they sell their flats?
 
I propose that everyone that bought a new flat from HDB
 
sell to a young couple at the same price they bought it.

So BTO should be marked to market to reflect the ever rising premium?  
 
Agree there are helps available (more and more grants like giving to beggers) but public housing should really stay public, making it a money making machine just deviates from its original intention and purpose.

...
Go read what i said lah. Did I ever say that?
I just said that they've made a bad mistake in allowing it to being marked to market. But it's not a mistake that they can just erase off the record.
 
So you agree about what? Public housing should stay public in what way? Having an artificial limit on HDB RESALE prices? 

If BTO prices ever become exorbitantly expensive, don't worry. The generation of buyers will vote No to PAP.
 
I did in 2011 when i was pissed off with MBT.
 
But is the situation same as it was in 2008-2011? No.
 
Frankly my opinion is that if we were as frugal as most of our parents, and saved at THEIR savings rate, most people will be able to well afford their HDB and even more. It's just that we spend a lot of money on frills.

Actually hor..
we don't even need to be as frugal as our parents' generation.
As I calculated before, couple with $8k combined income could easily afford half million loan using their CPF. They can use their take home pay to buy car go tour.
Is the HDB flat really out of reach like the bird nest in Hong Kong?
 
... or are they complaining the condo is out of reach?

The original intent for HDB is to house the people away from the slum. after a while, the system work and demand is good to clear more land for development as a result, the govt find it profitable and used this housing model to "tied"people to find job to pay housing loan using cash and CPF. those days got no land title but by physical occupation of the land- like kampung, village and those squatter areas.
 
after a generation, with more wealth generation of the HDB, people in charge tend to get greedy in GDP and growth path. to stimulate more growth, more intake of PR and others to contribute to national growth.
 
as more people comes in, there is a squeeze for housing and increase the prices as to make people stay longer- the original intake is malaysia PR and follow by other nationalities.
 
with more competition for housing, the tendency is increase prices across all sectors- with more money generation, more money is good- with talk of 6.9M- which is a good idea as more wealth is sucked into the system. 
 
of course, now the bubble get too big with low interest rate since 2008. what to do, now with all CM  to stable the market- will property drop it will- but never to the earlier prices which is impossible for that correction to come down- if come down more intake like a US Fed QE to pump more money into the system- so can the govt do that with more intake of PR to boost prices. the bottom line is where is the equilibrium price ? nobody know except the policy maker- they have a band for calculation like our SGD by MAS with a basket of currency for the price movement within the controlled upper tier and lower tier.

When Subsidized Flat owners choose to sell their property ... There should not be a profit ...
 
This will weed out the abusers & opportunity seekers ...
 
It is not only about young couples ... But those who truly need the help ...
 
Applicants of HDB will then truly consider if this is the route they seek ...
 
That is my point ...

The original intent for HDB is to house the people away from the slum. after a while, the system work and demand is good to clear more land for development as a result, the govt find it profitable and used this housing model to "tied"people to find job to pay housing loan using cash and CPF. those days got no land title but by physical occupation of the land- like kampung, village and those squatter areas.
 
after a generation, with more wealth generation of the HDB, people in charge tend to get greedy in GDP and growth path. to stimulate more growth, more intake of PR and others to contribute to national growth.
 
as more people comes in, there is a squeeze for housing and increase the prices as to make people stay longer- the original intake is malaysia PR and follow by other nationalities.
 
with more competition for housing, the tendency is increase prices across all sectors- with more money generation, more money is good- with talk of 6.9M- which is a good idea as more wealth is sucked into the system. 
 
of course, now the bubble get too big with low interest rate since 2008. what to do, now with all CM  to stable the market- will property drop it will- but never to the earlier prices which is impossible for that correction to come down- if come down more intake like a US Fed QE to pump more money into the system- so can the govt do that with more intake of PR to boost prices. the bottom line is where is the equilibrium price ? nobody know except the policy maker- they have a band for calculation like our SGD by MAS with a basket of currency for the price movement within the controlled upper tier and lower tier.

 
 
Come on, this is just what you think. The world is changing, and every factors and variables changes every minute. It is easy to 马后砲, but prices of homes in singapore is not just because of policies. Instead, by external factors.
 
It is easy to be critical of the policy maker, say this say that, who couldn't? 

 
I believe this is how HK subsidized housing works.

Thanks! Invaluable information, since you have no obligation for this. But what about the ceilings and difficulties in getting HOS flats? Why is is that people are finding in hard to own homes in Hong Kong? Btw, many of my assumptions is base on TVBS HK dramas,   .

Bro, its depends on what you mean by win or lose.
 
It is mathematically, theoretically, and realistically possible for everyone to make money.
This is especially so for the property market which is base on valuation.
On the flip side, What this means also is that, it is possible for everyone to lose money.
 
In fact, it is exactly becos in recent times everybody made money from properties as valuation stayed high. So the next buyer continued to gain. Nobody lost. (Whether on paper or otherwise)  However once sentiments turn and valuations follow, not everybody will make.  This scenario is already in play as several folks liquidate with losses.
 
People often overlook that if one can make big bucks in a short time, one can also lose big bucks in that same amt of time.
 
Anyway, my bet is there will be many more losses to come. 
And my bet has a very good historical track record.
 
Heh
ya...i know what u mean bro. There are people out there who is savvy enough to have gained even when others have fallen on the wayside but these cases are far and in between. During the 30s..90s and only recently during the USA subprime crisis people were investing and buying properties thinking shite wont happen soon....when shite hit the fan and many lost their home and money many suffered and there are those who paid the ultimate price by just giving up their lives. Money is a finite commodity (eventhough there's trillions out there) but most of us are bounded by our salary and what not. There is a cliff in every bull run and that cliff is getting higher and higher bcos everybody thinks the cliff is still far in sight. The way our property had ballooned in the past few decades is just like the bull run....nobody knows when will it burst and i hope i wont see what happened in the 90s where i know of many who lost hundreds of thousand in only a few months some people might even say days. Luckily most of us uses cpf to buy our housing because the losses wont actually hurt our pocket as we have nearly given up the idea of enjoying the money that is ours but not actually ours!

ya la everything on external factor- blame others except yourself- good excuse.  external factor is due to global low interest rate the money printing  machine by US- excess liquidity to search for higher yield return that is property in Asia. 
 
give me some variable and factors- that is not attributable to them. dont just brush off like that- leh

When Subsidized Flat owners choose to sell their property ... There should not be a profit ...
 
This will weed out the abusers & opportunity seekers ...
 
It is not only about young couples ... But those who truly need the help ...
 
Applicants of HDB will then truly consider if this is the route they seek ...
 
That is my point ...

 
I completely agree.
 
Too many new flat applicants just want to buy from HDB
 
to sell at a profit and buy a bigger flat.
 
But how do you propose we stop them?
 
Only sell back to HDB or sell to new onwer at the same price?
 
If sell to new owner at same price then there will be under table money.
 
The other problem with both these methods is people will not take
 
care of their flats. Its only because people buy and "own" their own
 
flats that people really take care of it. If people hand back flats to HDB at cost
 
it will be really dirty and run down flats.

I'm no Scholar ... But if you ask me, I would say all flats should be sold back to HDB ...
 
If one choses to upgrade ... You can sell back to HDB your current existing flat & then apply for a bigger unit ... A HDB Flat cannot be Re-Sold to an Open Market other than HBD themselves, to kerb Speculations ... 
 
Which type of unit will depend on the Income Status you belong to & also your Current Needs ...
 
e.g. Stylo Milo Couples can choose to buy ECs ...
 
e.g. Bigger Families can choose Jumbo Flats ...
 
HDB to cater to different scenarios ...
 
If you are Damn Loaded after some years of hard work & would like to continue to live in a Flat, you may continue to do so ... But you cannot sell it for a Profit to Upgrade to a Private Property ... You cannot at anytime deprive the opportunity of others by owning a Subsidized & Private Property at the same time ... 
 
Past Generations have enjoyed the Benefits & Subsidies from the HDB ... I feel that its only fair our Future Generations get to enjoy it too ... And not at this type of current Market Pegged Valuation ... 
 
HDB must Steer back to their original intentions before it deviates any further ...

actually ideally that should be the case right from the beginning, but i guess it is hard to turn back the clock.
 
Even if a flat rate apply, the price will still be on the upside gradually, you definitely won't be seeing sub $100K flat sold today. The disconnection to the overall economy with such a big gap is hard to imagine.
 
anyway the current solution of HDB buying back from the old folk maybe what you suggested in disguise. At least it take care of those old folk who squander their saving and left with a flat that worth $20K.

HDB houses 80% of the singapore population.
If what u say is going to happen, the singapore economy will tank overnight.
Essentially easily tens of billions dollars (which btw are people's own dollars) will disappear overnight.

Your solution will only have worked if it was set up in 1960s.
And yes like jamesc, it will only have the effect of making slum towns.

I like all your ideas but there is one tweeny weeny small problem.
 
If we keep the price of flats low then everyone will want one.
 
The queue will be endless. To control the queue you may want to
 
lower the income ceiling so that only low income people can buy.
 
The problem with this is anyone above the low income ceiling even $1
 
will not be able to buy so that have to buy private and they will not be able
 
to buy. If your tier it to mid income to buy EC the same problem will happen,
 
everyone in the middle income bracket will want to buy an EC and the queue will be
 
endless again. The other problem is the minimum occupany period,
 
how long should this be 5 years, 10 years? If 5 years then everyone will want
 
to upgrade to a new flat every 5 years. If 10 years then people will complain
 
my family getting bigger, no space no space.

This issue is a sensitive one, as both sides are affected... Bottomline, nobody want to lose out..
Anyway, looks like current trend will continue to stay, affordable enough for young couples to buy their first flat , and yet not enough to create a crash...
Just some soft landing, before prices pick up slowly and gradually at an affordable price in tandem with wages increase...
They need to clear up the mess created under MBT, and looks like Khaw has done a pretty decent job till now.

If the Singapore Economy is going to Collapse overnight because of HDB ... Does it also mean that Singapore is too Reliant on HDB ... If so, isn't that a worrying trend we should look into?
 
If 80% of the population live in HDB Flats ... It will look Normal & Common ...
 
If 10% - 20% live in HDB Flats ... Now that Slum Town Effect will come in ...

Margaret Thatcher leaned from Singapore that selling the concil house or flat 
 
to the owner meant that they would take care of it. Renting it to them means
 
people will let their flats run down.
 
No one looks after things as well as when it belongs to them.

tens of billions that will be in cpf which does not account to my individual and family economics. Luckily many hdb dwellers pays using the cpf monies so any losses wont be felt until comes the drawdown date. If the private property sinks then that will be a worrisome scenario!

Anyway ask her to take one for the team
 
If we implement the CYF system then she kids and all kids
 
will have affordable housing.
 
As for  significantly increase salaries I completely agree 
 
I have been asking my boss for this to solve the housing problem
 
but he keeps ignoring me.
 
I will vote for you to be Finance Minister to implement the higher salaries
 
the significantly  salaries.

thankless? The remuneration is not insignificant. Shouldn't the previous office holders be held responsible for the debacle they created? HDB prices are pegged to open market. Open market pegged to HDB vice versa. Infinite looping with CPF ensuring enough money to fund the spiral. How now?

now that HDB prices are so high.
 
if you pull down the prices what will ppl like my youngest sis who paid 600+k for a 4-room flat? 
 
you are not fair to them. 
 
she is going to take a broomstick and poke Tharma's ashhole. 
 
the best way is to significantly increase salaries so HDBs remain affordable.
 
but dont restructure the economy again or i poke his ashhole. 
 
the economy changed too fast in recent yrs for many old men like me to cope. 

 
Lets say I paid $1M for a HDB ... And the Next Day like Stock Market, it crashes ...
 
If I bought to Speculate ... I would have made a huge lost ... It a Gamble ... Some Win ... Some Lose ...
 
If I bought to Stay ... I would have chosen a wrong timing to buy, just like the COE ... But I would still have a Roof over my Head ... 
 
When one Speculates, there is no sure win formula ... But if one chooses to Speculate, do it at one's own Risk ... And with one's own money, not Subsidized Tax Payers Money ...

 The ministers all complain our salary to high liao (but they themselved say their salary needs to be high)and you want salaries to be increased! Do that and we will lose our competitive edge.Your sis bought what kind of hdb flats....600k for a 4 room flat is ex! Maybe the oni way i think to go is the gov giving subdidies for a SG citizen to buy a house. Maybe for each citizen to be given 50-75k each. So if a couple are Sg citizen they can get roughly around 150k of subsidy. PR wont get any....if 1 couple is one PR and 1 SGian oni the SGians will get.
For those who had bought earlier maybe the subsidy should be pegged to the yr they bought maybe starting from the yr 2007 as prices then were quite affordable.

If one choses to upgrade ... You can sell back to HDB your current existing flat & then apply for a bigger unit ... A HDB Flat cannot be Re-Sold to an Open Market other than HBD themselves, to kerb Speculations ... 
 

 
This is a good idea, except that it will drive the income gap between rich and poor even larger
 
The less financial well to do will go with  the HDB path.  At the end, they don't make anything from their flat.
 
The private properties will however be booming.  Since some  people can't get HDB from open market, they will turn to private causing the private market to increase further.
 
If you consider 80% of people are in HDB and 20% in private, a lot of those HDB folks will financially be stuck in the rut but the private folks will get richer than ever.
 
Big wealth disparity between rich and poor is also not a good thing.

the pressure they face is disproportionate compared to private sector.
 
thus cant say whether their salaries are justifiable.
 
it is rather subjective.
 
these prices are more of current govt's mismanagement.

The flow of easy money in the last 7-8 yrs has flooded into all stable economies. Especially small ones like our own.
The pte housing prices has risen quite significantly due to this.
 
The HDB BTO prices should have been held firm then. But unfortunately they did the double whammy mistake of drastically reducing BTO supply (for new citizens/PR + own local demand) + pegging BTO pricing to market valuation for a few years.
 
Now interest rates are still low, only when this increases significantly, will there be more major downward pressure on prices. The PC oversupply issue should also come into play in next 2 yrs and beyond.

...
Go read what i said lah. Did I ever say that?
I just said that they've made a bad mistake in allowing it to being marked to market. But it's not a mistake that they can just erase off the record.
 
So you agree about what? Public housing should stay public in what way? Having an artificial limit on HDB RESALE prices? 
 
If BTO prices ever become exorbitantly expensive, don't worry. The generation of buyers will vote No to PAP.
 
I did in 2011 when i was pissed off with MBT.
 
But is the situation same as it was in 2008-2011? No.
 
Frankly my opinion is that if we were as frugal as most of our parents, and saved at THEIR savings rate, most people will be able to well afford their HDB and even more. It's just that we spend a lot of money on frills.
 
 

Well at least we are on the same page on marking to market but I do think that so long as HDB is allowed to be rented out perpetually (after 5 years MOP) and the rich can continue to buy/hold them despite holdings multiple private properties (and staying in their private properties), valuation will continue to rise and with rising valuation, everyone will use it to make monies instead of seeing it as a primary residence, which is its intent.  If you are not staying in your HDB, you should sell.  That will ease resale price and stop the hoarding.
 
The mindset that HDB is for primary occupation of owners and his/her family has to be reinforced, otherwise there is nothing public about our public housing scheme.

Well that part i'm neutral on. I think there maybe some benefit to removing this "loophole". Though i also want to exploit this later on... though i will stay on in my HDB.  
 
Frankly even though some of my friends could have bought a HDB (resale/BTO) like me and then buy a condo later. Hardly any of them did. And we are all middle class folks working in govt/pte sectors. None of us are tremendously successful like T2/Porker or what.
I'm the only one of my close friends living in a HDB.
The people holding a HDB then buying another Pte property in future will reduce quite a lot. From my personal limited experience from all my peers and my wife's peers.

Talking about the rich staying in private homes and rent out their HDB(or the other way round), I am also neutral. On 1 side, why are the rich profiting from good rental income subsidised by the government. But on the other side,  if there is not enough rental flats available, not many PRs or any FTs can afford private properties rental.

What you proposed is effectively devaluating the SGD, and inflate the over-pricing of housing and other things away, which will happen, and the "increasing salary" part is happening already.  Even if they call it "progressive" wages or other names, minimum wage system is being implemented.
 
Me agree with your idea, as this is the least painful solution for home owners, and least risky from 2016 voting point of view.  All that need to be tackled is how retirees with no income will be compensated for the reduced value of their savings and assets in order their votes are not lost to the opposition.  That's why now there is Pioneer Package, increase medical subsidies etc.
 
Meanwhile maybe we should all stock up broomsticks, supply will be short and we can make some $$ with so many people wanting to use broomsticks to poke!

20 years back HDB was quite strict on this. HDB lessees are allowed to buy a private property for investment, but must continue to live in their HDB flat. If they move to their private property, must sell away the HDB flat.
 
Somewhere along the way, some Ministar overbuilt HDB flats and price was depressed. To clear up the shit, rules were eased, allowing private property owners to buy resale flats to rent out for profit. Then pre-building of flats stopped, all changed to BTO.

From 2007 to 2013, the hdb flat resale prices (proxy to the hdb resale flat index http://www.singstat.gov.sg/statistics/visualising_data/chart/HDB_Resale_Price_Index.html) has increased by 100%. Did the overall population income increased by anywhere close to that %? It's long overdue for the government to step in and control the downward cycle rather than a spectacular crash sometime down the road. Yes, definitely there is some more room to go down. This really hurts the aspiring owners who are waiting for the new ECs or condos as they have purchased the ECs/condos near the peak and now they are facing the decline in their value of their hdb flats.
For those who want to invest in a property, my guess is one have to wait for at least 2-3 years (~1.5% drop per quarter in the hdb resale prices so you can estimate how long it will take to drop to a reasonable level). Perhaps sometimes after 5-6 years later, it will be clearer if the property prices are going up or not.

Please lah, if the old folk can hold on to a higher value property, why count on the kid? This should be the way and it is not selfish, the old can hold on to something and support themselves.
 
And dun say old vote for p8p just due to the property value, when they appreciate what they have benefited, it is their right to show their appreciation. If you not happy ask the current generation to do something, everything also want the old generation to take care and change for you.

 
Count on the kid??? Think you should read with your eyes open wide. Today the kid need to count on parent to buy their first property.

Think we all know the 3 most important factors of any property is:
1) location 2) location and 3) location 
 
Location really is the main factor for property prices like it or not.
The other factors like facing, condition etc pales in comparison to location.
 
Most buyers are willing to pay top notch prices for mature estates like Queenstown,
Toa Payoh, Bishan etc which is not surprising.
 
So if you are lucky to be able to own a flat in a popular location,
hold on to it if you can especially as it will be convenient as far as commuting is concerned
and also amenities. Cash out only if you need the proceeds say for your retirement but
otherwise it will bound to appreciate faster than those in the surburbs IMO.

true.. its all about location.. at the same time, it can be about the environment and neighbours. my friend stays in AMK but due to the neighbour (abit crazy, gangster and dangerous. once approached neighbour with chopper. luckily no one was hurt), the family is considering moving out.. no use calling popo as it may cause more trouble for the family..
 
good luck to the next owner if they are selling.. its like buying a resale house and realise that the previous owner moved due to ahlong problems. town council/previous house owner can do a good job in covering up the paints etc.

so when viewing resale hdb.. can always chat with the immediate neighbours to know more about the selling unit.. etc..
 
and my dad asked me to climb the stairs up to see if any paintjobs done ... even its 8 floors up.. im ok.. just slowly stroll up and viola.. really got paint job done.. could be other units as well... 
 
also notice if the gates are freshly painted by owner.. could be a hint too  ..

It's on the news! The government has already stated that the current market situtation has not reached expected results. One of the ministers said that the TDSR is here to stay. The only chance we have of the cooling measures being reduced is probably next year when there's election. lol.

true.. its all about location.. at the same time, it can be about the environment and neighbours. my friend stays in AMK but due to the neighbour (abit crazy, gangster and dangerous. once approached neighbour with chopper. luckily no one was hurt), the family is considering moving out.. no use calling popo as it may cause more trouble for the family..
 
good luck to the next owner if they are selling.. its like buying a resale house and realise that the previous owner moved due to ahlong problems. town council/previous house owner can do a good job in covering up the paints etc.

 
Environment and neighbours this one abit heng suay but of course you must do your homework
as much as it's feasible to do so.
 
What you say is true esp the ahlong, that one is a nightmare 
Home is for us to seek refuge after a hard day's work and if come back to see paint on your
walls or pig's head then

Wah your dad is a careful and observant man 
 
Very good, practical and yet simple observations to avoid a potential nightmare!!

True for own stay good neighbours is an important factor other than location and price. 
 
However if I need to check every floor for evidence of O$P$ I would choose to go down the stairs instead

Think we all know the 3 most important factors of any property is:
1) location 2) location and 3) location 
 
Location really is the main factor for property prices like it or not.
The other factors like facing, condition etc pales in comparison to location.
 
Most buyers are willing to pay top notch prices for mature estates like Queenstown,
Toa Payoh, Bishan etc which is not surprising.
 
So if you are lucky to be able to own a flat in a popular location,
hold on to it if you can especially as it will be convenient as far as commuting is concerned
and also amenities. Cash out only if you need the proceeds say for your retirement but
otherwise it will bound to appreciate faster than those in the surburbs IMO.

 
In SG, location is irrelevant
 
every spot is or will soon to be prime location
 
that is why punggol HDB at one time was priced the same as city fringe HDB
 
and now jurong PSF matching with prime district too
 
really thankful to the govt for enhancing our asset value. My yishun HDB soon to be worth $1 million

so which overseas investment do u recommend?
 
i prefer those that have zero downpayment
 
zero interest during construction
 
able to flip immediately after booking
 
plus rental guarantee one
 
thanks,

You have a fair point on this especially with de-centralisation and the making of satellite towns
like Tampines and now Jurong. That said, old habits die hard so nearer Central estates like Bishan,
Toa Payoh and Queenstown still command a premium albeit it's narrowing. 
 
This is proven with the over-subscription every time a matured estate is up for grabs vs New Town. Bidadari will be priced higher and more sought after vs Tengah in future BTOs for sure.

my guess is citizen ABSD & SSD will be reduced but FT & PR measures remain.. win win situation so locals cannot blame FTs/PRs for rising home prices & still enjoy upside if locals really can push it up themselves

they know but they cant do anything abt current HDB flats... no garmen in power dares to crash property mkt on purpose..
 
in 1996 when they first intro resale gains tax, it caused the prop mkt to crash all the way 2003... was made worse with 2000 tech bubble n sars... but the resale gains tax was the first trigger..
 
so they dont want to do crashing policies coz inflation is necessary to maintain their strong SGD policy.
 
my view is all policies are based ard the SGD

Don't need to crash the HDB prices. Just Limit the BTO price.. they have 6 years to do it.
 
Year 1 every quarter reduce price by 10K. 1 year BTO will reduce 40K.
 
6 years 40 X 6 = 240K for them to play with.
 
as long as you have cheap houses in non mature estate.. they can keep their policy in mature estate

Mature estate and non mature estate should always have a large price different.
 
if the price different is only 10~50K, who will buy non mature estate?

of course yishun flat may become $1m some day even if it's 500k now.. And on that day, the ones that cost $700k at kallang will also cost $1.2-1.5m.. And the condo in city or city fringe will become $3-5m from their 1.5m to 3m price now... I would prefer to have a higher absolute gain in capital even if the percentage gain is lesser.Look at Hong Kong with their extensive rail network.. The price of Chai Wan area can be higher than causeway bay?? All accessible by public transport..

yeah.. I don't expect BTO to be around 300K in those area. but 500K should be the max while area like jurong and yishun should be around 200K max for the same unit.

The answer to this is to change the name from HDB to to CDB 
 
Condo Development Board.
 
Then call every new flat sold as a Condo. 
 
Then everyone in Singapore can stay in a condo.
 
There is already Executive Condo and now we can have
 
Workers Condo. After all we have Orchid Country Club
 
 
so factory workers can play goft right.
 
Now lets build condos for everyone so
 
everyone can stay in a condo. No need to upgrade.

For some reason I never liked the name H Dee Bee. 
 
I don't know why but I always like the name C Bee Dee, 
 
to me C Bee Dee just sounds like higher class.
 
In Singapore everyone wants high class things
 
especially those with no class.

In SG, location is irrelevant
 
every spot is or will soon to be prime location
 
that is why punggol HDB at one time was priced the same as city fringe HDB
 
and now jurong PSF matching with prime district too
 
really thankful to the govt for enhancing our asset value. My yishun HDB soon to be worth $1 million  

 
so which overseas investment do u recommend?
 
i prefer those that have zero downpayment
 
zero interest during construction
 
able to flip immediately after booking
 
plus rental guarantee one
 
thanks,  

 
Yishun area is really going to be very happening! Alot of construction going on and i heard there will be a integrated development. Condo+aircon interchange + mrt+ shopping more all combined into 1 development!
 
I would reccomand the bridge. It's a cambodia condo. I bought a soho as an investment. 18% guarantee rental returns and i just read the newspaper last week. 36% increase in new companies registered in cambodia. no construction interest. you want more info can visit their website thebridge-oxley.com

jumbo unit woodland got alot ..... biggest ones are those 3 room flat + 4 room +balcony or common corridor lump up as one. Think size are~ 192sqm which translate to 2000+ sqf and all cost 700-800+ K due to limited numbers. Not building anymore. Maybe ex cos "limited edition". If dun mind, think 10 years later that area should be quite developed due to the opening of Thomson line and other developments. Now quite bare.

One flat. You can MUST have an opening between the 2 units but if you install a door there, you can easily stay in one unit and rent out the other without violating MOP.

Jumbo units don't need to be built. You can buy 2 adjoining 3 rooms and combine them. Please see the link I posted above.
 
They are rare because there are few of them. But it is possible for you to buy a 3 room and then pray your neighbor will sell his flat to you to join it.

I was actually targeting one about 1.5 years back (Holland area).
 
The owner was a single old lady living in one side and renting the other out. Crazy old lady wanted 150k above valuation for the flat (980k+) when 3 rooms in the area were going for around 430-450k (including COV). 
 
I could have just bought a normal 3 room and then offered the neighbor an additional 40k above market value and still saved 40-80k. Did not go thru with the deal and didn't follow up so I'm not sure if it is still in the market.

wow! Yishun sure sounds exciting, but i don't think i can afford paying $1,500 psf for it.
 
The cambodia also sound like a great investment. Heard the developer also very generous to agents for the commission too

It is the same government that jack up the price to such a level and it is again the same people trying to bring it down again.
 
They will defend vigorously that price is not high then suddenly they will tell you they need to cool it down. So, people don't know when will they ever tell the truth. 
 
However, the current HDB is definitely making a huge profit without taking land cost. This one even primary school boys know. I do support all Singaporean should be given a roof over their head and pay only the actual cost. If they want frills, then go for private and return the flat to the government. Keep the flats affordable for those who need them.

Construction cost should range from $100-$150 a foot for HDB. A 1,200 sq ft unit costs between $120,000 to $180,000. If you add in cost for HDB's operation which I believe is totally fair, it is still quite a distance from the sales price.

Trouble is that Govt thinking is that the piece of land if sold to developers can fetch in $x and thus they factor this in as well albeit lower than what a private developer will pay for it.
 
Whilst I can understand this school of thought, Govt should bear in mind that this land is for public housing and hence what private developers are willing to pay should not be taken into consideration.
But Govt will then counter argue that proceeds from land sales goes into the reserves for our long term benefits and used for emergencies and possible funding of policies to help the citizens, an endless argument........

I don't surpport that Singaporean should have a flat sold only at actual cost, the richer one should pay more to subsidize those less fortunate one. Bigger flats or those at mature estate should be price much higher so that more money can be collected to help the poor. 
 
It is always those flats in mature area that are snapped up really quickly despite the higher price. Since there are demands, why not price it higher and use the money to subsidize the poorer folks more. Attached pic from HDB may 2015 launch. Almost anyone can afford a HDB.

It is called mark to market  and too much of it cause inflation.   
And look at Pinnacle, if you don't price it off market, how to allocate choice units ? The lucky ones allocated will laugh all the way to the bank, that is also not fair to majority. Sell back to HDB at cost plus inflation?

Less fortunate not lazy. Lazy should be punished, some are just less fortunate. Anyway our income tax rate for the rich is very low, unless you don't mind paying more.

Oh come on, the income tax already managed that as mentioned.
 
Life's is like that. Nobody is equal.
We try to help as we move along.
Who qualifies as less fortunate?
How much more should be given?
I think that is not lacking.

Less of becoming welfare state, more of making lives of everyone slightly more equitable. And from my stand, just to help every household at least own a small flat that their lives can be base on.

Less of becoming welfare state, more of making lives of everyone slightly more equitable. And from my stand, just to help every household at least own a small flat that their lives can be base on.
Brother, isnt that happening?
It is lah, lets acknowledge the good work.
Of course there will be some who fall thru the cracks and thats where we as citizens help when we see.
But to then continuously look to others to "subsidize" our living more and more just dont cut it.

Our income tax rate for less fortunate is basically zero plus got subsidy, if you want to compare.
 
So rich and hardworking should be punished?
Oh come on, the income tax already managed that as mentioned.
 
Life's is like that. Nobody is equal.
We try to help as we move along.
Who qualifies as less fortunate?
How much more should be given?
I think that is not lacking.
 
The moment we become welfare state, we are FINISHED.

 
Yes, so agree with this. And the biggest FAIL I have seen in the recent few years is the transition of the PAP to a populist demagogue party.

i wldnt say its a fail, more like a transition to a less autocratic nation... but in short term they might have lost their spine more than necessary. 
 
A leader needs to arise n stamp authority n be willing to step on some toes in return for the greater need of rest of nation

you can be a putin, but civil liberties will definitely suffer ++.
 
In this day and age of internet, parodies, social media, no one can be a ultra firm and authoritative leader anymore lah.
 
I mean 30 years ago, the only nickname u can give Mr Lee is lao lee. Anything else would have likely seen u in Court apologising your pants off.
Now everyone on EDMW calls our PM pinkie freely and openly.
 
It's a fine balance that the PAP has to tread. 
 
Haha don't we love democracy  

You can't expect 80% of the population to understand the trade-offs of the major policies.
Everyone wants their cheaper, better, faster.
 

I've nothing against with the way land parcels are sold currently.
 
Haha just remove the stupid development charge discount for balconys, plantar boxes etc LOL.
 
The pte market is the pte market as long as HDB build enough BTOs (which they didn't do and has since improved).

Tharman said it in 2014. I agreed.
 
We are moving into 2016.
 
If you ask him in 2016 again, he will say macroeconomic situations will dictate future housing prices. Interest rates, deflationary pressures etc... It might cool further by itself and the danger of a crash needs to be guarded against.

heard rentals are getting tough, so i guess the trend is there but slow...
+1% in the next coming year for interest won't really tax anyone except the heavily leveraged.
But the poor yields may make the savvy multiple property investors cut losses.

Rental is tough only for private residential properties. HDB flats are still asking and getting good rentals because too many FW willing to share rooms and hence sustain the whole flat and individual rooms rental rates.

If I can rent a 3 BR condo at $2500 at The Luxurie, near MRT, I would expect 5-room HDB flats nearby to go for below 2k.  It is all interlinked. Condo can also squeeze people.

I dunno. Good point.
But does total number of units affect AV? At least based on the FAQ pamphlet, it doesn't state that.
 
I thought it's just estimated rental amount for the whole unit x their own multiplier.

I didn't said it should make any sense but the current rental prices for both property types are advertised clearly for all to see. Although The Luxurie can also squeeze people, most landlords will freaked out if their agent wants them to rent to big groups of FW like the maximum 9 occupants permitted for HDB 5 room flat. Also, those condo residents usually think they are more atas than HDB and will usually not hesitate to KPKB to the MC if they find their next door neighbours had rented out their units to big groups of FW and "cheapen" their properties. As a general rule of thumb, the size of a typical 3 bedroom unit in The Luxurie is smaller than a standard HDB 5 room flat, their Mickey Mouse rooms will be a tight squeeze and limit the number of occupants. Most FWs will try to save as much money as possible and if they think they are paying even slightly more than what is necessary to stay in a Condo, they will not share to rent it unless someone else is footing the difference.
 
Also, don't forget that the prices you paid for your properties play an important part too. Private property landlords under a lot of pressure to meet monthly mortgage repayments and will be more eager to rent out their properties at a lower rent if necessary. HDB lessees certainly have less pressure to lower their asking rents especially if they are servicing HDB loans. I will not be surprised to find many HDB lessees like myself who will be able to enjoy a 8% -12% ROI if we rent out our properties simply because we bought our flats in the early 2000s. Not many private property owners can enjoy such ROI unless they didn't cash out and have been holding on to their properties all this while.

Some truths to it but we are not talking about yield or ROI, which is a function of initial purchase price, I think you are confusing the 2.  I seriously don't think HDB rental rate can be maintained when rental of private condo is under so much pressure.   
Based on HDB website, 5-room HDB rental rate in Sengkang in the vicinity of Sengkang MRT has already dropped from around $2500 to $2100 (a few transactions as low as $1800-1900) in Nov/Dec 2015.  We can agree to disagree given you have doubt over gov statistics.

This is all wrong.
 
HDB is for the people to live in.
Not for renting out and profiteering.
Its subsidized money.
 
HDB should do something about the rampant misuse of HDB for rental gains especially in a non owner occupied situation.

I am not so conversant in hdb policy but i understand that hdbs cannot be fully rented out without prior approval right?  Yet many people do, by simply locking one door.  Thats a blatant way of circumventing the rules.  HDB should tighten up a bit.  Just like our car loan limits.  If the govt only set policies and dont ensure compliance then its a toothless lion.

After 5 years MOP, can rent out whole house and stay in condo.  Many are doing it legally.  @Kusje is right, it is a deliberate govt policy to allow the middle income to huat and boast about their high ROI of subsidized flat.   Just to clarify, I am not saying I support the policy but it does help to support "asset enhancement" and keep middle class happy.

It is as Voodooman explained.
 
The so called approval is just to collect stamp duty la - I have never heard of anyone who has had their application rejected.
 
Those "lock one room" guys are not exploiting a loophole - it is 100% illegal. If you have proof of someone doing so, go ahead and report them.

Bro, we will be looking at private properties doubling in price in a year or two if HDB renting is made illegal. HDB is the most powerful cooling measure for private properties. 
 
What is proposed will have serious ramifications.

Thats what i feel is not right.  If you are rich enough to buy a condo and live there then its tome to give the subsidized housing to the right people who need them.

If people cant rent their hdb out, you think they can buy private properties?
A large category if buyers would be cut out.
 
If people can afford let them buy, if people cant, dont.

But no matter what, money finds its own equilibrium.
You think the foreigner who earns $5k a month will rent a $4k apartment?
They will simply group together to share costs so it will find an equilibrium, it weont simply drive prices up, like you think.  
 
If there are not so many foreigners who cant afford $5k rents, then there arent so many who can afford $5k rents.  No two ways about it

The ability to rent is crucial to certain industries. Certain industries will have to close down in the longer run.
 
How about 3 pax sharing? Or 6 pax sharing? 
 
Can't have a system reset so easily.

Supply n demand playing its part everyday now. Though some may wan2 rent or sell at their asking prices but then not many r biting now apparantly. Gone r the days where new launches sold out within days or btos oversubscribed 10 over times now. 
 
1. More btos topping up already from those launched in 2011 and 2012. And to be honest. Theres gonna be a huge no of 2013s to be topping up soon. Some might even give up their existing hdbs to move to their btos ot even to their ecs... in fact more ecs means more hdb resales in the pipelines soon.
2. Rental yields for privates getting smaller by the day too. Seems like a new 1m flat. Can only rent for less than 3k.
Of coz for those who bought their 1m flat at say 600k yrs ago huat dam boh. But seeing these figures. Many potential cono buyers may fret at such low yields

I made friends with several PRC gals in recent months because they happened to be working in my clients or business partners' companies as accounts gals or secretaries. Everyone of them are sharing HDB rooms with strangers of the same sex. I was rather taken aback by their frugal attitudes. One of them is paying $600 for a common room in CCK and I presume her roommate is paying the same amount. $1200 x 2 is $2400 for both common rooms. The master room can be rented out for $800-$1000 but lets just assume the lower figure of $800. Total rent collected is $3200 for a 4 room HDB flat. I believe this scenario is being played out in many parts of Singapore. My own next door neighbour has been renting out all her 3 bedrooms of her 4 room HDB flat for the past 15 years. If I had done the same for my 5 room flat and went to live with my in-laws in 2001, I would have earned about $500K in rental by now.

We are looking at through the roof prices for private properties.

Definitely not $1200. $1200 is for condo room rental.  
Anyway, that works out to be around $2k per month for the owner which is really still not that bad. 
 
As for living with in law, I rather not do it, no matter how much money involved.

I think a common room in cck can fetch only around $600. Definitely not $1200. $1200 is for condo room rental.
 
Anyway, that works out to be around $2k per month for the owner which is really still not that bad.
 
As for living with in law, I rather not do it, no matter how much money involved.

I agree the common room can fetch $600 but this poor PRC gal is paying $600 and still must share that room with another complete stranger from PRC who is also paying $600.That is a ridiculous $1200 for just one common room in CCK. She told me there are a total of 6 persons including herself staying in the 4 room flat in CCK. All of them are females and complete strangers to each other. I also don't want to stay with my in-law and would rather gave up all those potential rental income.
Is there a law to penalise the hdb flat owner for over crowding or profiteering?

6 person to a 4 room is still ok. It is quite difficult for HDB to step in because some flats do house families of more than 6 person.

At least we now know why some people rent out their HDB flat and then used the rental proceeds to partially or fully subsidize their renting of a Condo for their own stay especially if they are trying to get their child into a nearby top primary school under the 1km priority rule and the Condo happened to be within 1 km of the school.

Public subsidized housing (HDB) policies should be as follow:
 
1) Flats sold at cost price
2) Singaporeans get priority in purchase
3) Flats cannot be leased
4) Flats cannot be sold for a profit
5) Owners cannot concurrently own a HDB flat and private property

Thanks very much for the greatest proposal to undo the top cooling measure for private property prices. 
 
This will cause private property prices to really run away from HDB prices. Fully delinked.

Absolutely except i would say that prices of flats may move with inflation and be sold back to HDB accordingly. So it will still reflect some growth over time, however it wont allow for profiteering.

No problem, if got money buy lar.If got no money then dont buy.
Thats the rule of the jungle.
 
Even if they put this in place, the market is a half dead cat.
Rental is not the only driving force behind properties.
Similarly, if a buyer wants to buy, no rental he will still buy.

Some of the valuation is based on rental value. That's why central hdbs btos are priced at 700k by Govt.  
If cannot rent, people who bought at those prices have the right to demand compensation. 
 
80 to 85% of housing are HDBs. A number who want to upgrade later or to go for multiple properties might proceed straight to private which comprises only 15 to 20% of housing stock. 
 
But private property owners will be greatly thankful for your suggestions.

Sorry wasn't following this thread for a while. Just to respond to some comments here.
 
Throttle2 - If you think the HDB prices increase is due to buyers and not government, how did the resale price 'stabilized' recently? Being the sole provider, they control the supply and demand.
 
Porker thinks HDB price is fair, good for him but many ordinary citizens couldn't afford. Take away land cost, they could buy a private apt with the same money.
 
Myxilplix don't see a problem for Government to make money selling HDB. Then we should let them make more for hospital, schools, police, army lah.
 
Coltplussport feels that richer should pay more. That is why the HDB concept has gone wrong. It is not for investment, it is for citizen to stay. Be it rich or poor, you return if you don't need them.

Agree, cannot monetarize HDB, gov needs to increase social spending as population ages, tax will increase.  Now just pass the cost on to future generation.  
 
But then if we don't wipe out our CPF for housing, maybe got money to pay for retirement and healthcare.

Property is NOT for rental. It is for living in.
Whether you get rental out of it is completely subjective.
 
People GOT NO RIGHT to ask for compensation unless rental is Guaranteed by seller and it is NOT.

High CPF and taxes hardly contributed by people who buy subsidized flats, right?
 
So the govt has already "penalised" the rich to support the poor.

Valuation is also based on the surrounding supply.
 
So if the government decides to release more plots or increase the plot ratio of my neighbor (but not me), I can get compensation too?

Progressive taxation is income based discrimination. Without any perks or benefits. And then penalized by not being eligible for a whole hosts of programs. Triple whammy.

Sir T2, with all due respect, 700k converted into a 30 year loan at 2.6% interest is $2800 per month. 
If rental value was not factored in, how would this amount be derived? 
 
Why did the Govt raise the ceiling for HDB eligibility? Only to trap its citizens into buying overpriced HDB without consideration of its rental value? I don't even own a HDB, just trying to clarify this with you.

From the horse's mouth for reference as well. HDB owners have been paying property taxes based on this method.

you missing the point, friend
 
The point is, no matter what method or theory or formula they use to derive the valuation or price of the flats to be sold,  
 
THE BUYER HAS NO RIGHT TO ASK FOR COMPENSATION FROM ANYONE IF HE CANT GET RENT UNLESS RENT IS GUARANTEED BY SELLER.
 
With all due respect, likewise.

I understand your point from the moral and ethical perspective.
 
Your proposal also benefit me greatly but at the expense of many other groups which cannot be good for the nation.
 
First it will cause HDB prices to plummet and huge hordes of foreigners, PRs and some Singaporeans to swarm to private properties for sale or rental. Private prices and rentals will spike. There needs to be a new department set up to monitor illegal rentals at HDBs.
 
When the system equilibrate years later, many of the foreigners and PRs will have left Singapore because of the extreme cost of living.

I reiterate what I said:
 
HDB should be sold at cost price and it is fair if they mark up a little to cover their cost of operation. I did not say land cost should be included in the sales price.

And further to the general policies I've proposed for HDB, let me ramble a little for private properties.
 
1) Private properties should not be used as an investment tool - a property is for people to stay
 
2) Owners who purchase and leave the units empty should be subjected to a hefty tax
 
3) Land sales should be based on open bidding system. The reserve price system should be scrapped.
 
How do the 3 points translate to the market? First the developers may lose their pants a bit    Prices will decline and stabilize at a level that reflects true demand. Incoming supply will slow to a level that reflects true demand. You won't see dark dark empty units when you drive by condos at night   Current property owners will cow peh cow boo and curse me

So bye bye to maybe three quarters of foreigners, PRs.
 
We will be the first country in the world that both private and public housing cannot be rented out and has zero investment value.
 
Not lose a bit. We are asking for our nation to say goodbye to the economies of the future. Who does this benefit?

I agree the common room can fetch $600 but this poor PRC gal is paying $600 and still must share that room with another complete stranger from PRC who is also paying $600.That is a ridiculous $1200 for just one common room in CCK. She told me there are a total of 6 persons including herself staying in the 4 room flat in CCK. All of them are females and complete strangers to each other. I also don't want to stay with my in-law and would rather gave up all those potential rental income.I tink she kena prawned..... usually if shared. Means by right shared cost one. Either the owner smart alec. Dupped her into this or she assumed....

Just to set the record straight because I keep seeing this point being overlooked in the discussion and debate. Unlike the owners of private leasehold residential properties, strictly speaking, you cannot really refer to yourself as a HDB Flat owner, you are only the lessee. You merely paid full rent albeit at a discount in advance to HDB for your new flat. If you are legally the owner in the eyes of the law, HDB will never be able to repossess back your flat for offenses like illegal subletting, killer littering etc. So ladies and gentlemen, gentle friendly reminder to you again that you do NOT own your HDB flat, you are only a long term tenant (lessee).

There are people whom rent out 4 room flat for hefty 18x$400 $7200 but these are illegal n will have their hdb re possessed..
Gd luck n merry xmas..

 
I will not ask for $1200. I will advertised as only $600 for a common room but stipulate that prospective tenant will need to share with another roommate of the same sex. $1200 in the pocket liao  But seriously, I will not want to rent out rooms to strangers no matter how nice and physically attractive they are because I always feel your home should be your private sanctuary, a place to retreat back to and unwind after a hard day at work.

You just opened a whole can of worms  
 
Oh dear, did I?  After checking the posts, everything seems fine except that I may have interpreted wrongly on some of the comments. Generally, everyone seems to agree HDB should never be an investment tools to lock the citizen money up. Or worse create a monster for the generations to come. Let HDB be just public housing for citizens. Go back to the good old days in the late 60.

From: http://tankinlian.blogspot.sg/2010/01/asset-enhancement.html
 
"Since the mid 1980s, the Government implemented market pricing and the asset enhancement policy for public housing, i.e HDB flats. The aim was to allow the heartlanders to have a chance to enjoy the appreciation of their HDB flat, which represents the the key assets for most of them.
 
This policy has led to a more than 10 fold increase in the price of HDB flats during the past 30 years. For most HDB flat owners, the increase in asset price does not translate into real wealth. They still need a place to live in, as the HDB flat is the only home that they hold. If they sell the flat, they have to buy a private propety at an even higher price."
 
In the formative years of Singapore, the first mammoth task that the fledgling government undertook was to provide shelter and housing for the people of this nation. The second was to instil loyalty and appreciation. The Housing and Development Board was set up to work on the first task and at break-neck pace it did. 
 
From: http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1589_2009-10-26.html

 
"In less than four years, it managed to build more housing units than SIT did in all its years of operation. From 1960 to 1963, HDB completed 30,906 dwelling units, whereas SIT built only 22,115 dwelling units over a 32-year period. In 1966, HDB declared that it had broken the back of the housing problem. At the end of 1959, only 9% of the total population was living in SIT flats. But by the end of 1965, 23% of the total population was living in HDB flats. As a result of HDB's sustained effort, more than 80% of Singapore's resident population was living in its flats by 1985, and the figure has remained above 80% ever since."
 
To accomplish the second task, the government embarked on the asset enhancement policy so that flat-owners (which formed and still form the majority of the population) would be able to have a positive perspective towards nation-building: to own the roof over your head and thus a stake in the country, and to have it continually appreciate in value over the years.
 
From: http://business.asiaone.com/property/news/3-values-home-ownership-legacy-mr-lee-kuan-yew

 
It would seem that Lee Kuan Yew personally championed the cause of home ownership and the relationship appreciating flat prices have with the prosperity of Singapore, and through that the motivated participation of individuals in nation-building.
 

"Finally, Mr Lee saw homeownership as a path to prosperity. He said, 'If Singapore prospers, their flat values will appreciate and they will share in the growth. Home ownership motivates Singaporeans to work hard and upgrade to better flats for a better quality of living. The HDB story reflects the social mobility in Singapore.'"
 
In recent years, with the new generation of leaders at the helm, it seems that the rhetoric has somewhat changed, with less emphasis on asset enhancement and more on social equity, a rather apparent shift to the left in national policy which is reflected in the Budget as well as policies that have been coming out of the government.
 
Regardless of this shift, the minds of the people have already been conditioned to view property-ownership as a means of wealth creation, and this will persist in spite of the changes in policies and statements from the policy-makers. The monster that you speak of is a legacy of past-year policies, and it cannot be easily slain by newly born measures.

The closest match would be Germany:
 
http://qz.com/167887/germany-has-one-of-the-worlds-lowest-homeownership-rates/
 
and as this country's stance on home-ownership and its track records prove, a sound economy need not always have high home-ownership as a cog in the economic engine of a prosperous nation.
 
If you read the article, you will see parallels between Germany and Britain in the early years after WW2. Then divergence sets in and today the property markets of the two nations are as different as chalk and cheese.
 
We will see that there were early parallels between the initial housing policies of Germany and Singapore, again with the divergence coming in during the 1980s, where Singapore was concerned, in the rising of the asset enhancement policy.
 
On hindsight based on the property market busts of the last few decades, one might opine that a burgeoning property market does not always bode well for any country that is trying to stabilise (and subsequently further) its economic growth. 
 
A few key points from the article:
 
"Most Germans don’t buy their homes, they rent."
 
"The country’s homeownership rate ranks among the lowest in the developed world"
 
"In Spain, around 80% of people live in owner-occupied housing. (Yay!) But unemployment is nearly 27%, thanks to the burst of a giant housing bubble. (Ooof.)"
 
"By the time of Germany’s unconditional surrender in May 1945, 20% of Germany’s housing stock was rubble. Some 2.25 million homes were gone. Another 2 million were damaged. A 1946 census showed an additional 5.5 million housing units were needed"
 
"Soon after West Germany was established in 1949, the government pushed through its first housing law. The law was designed to boost construction of houses which, 'in terms of their fittings, size and rent are intended and suitable for the broad population.'”
 
"Home-building boomed, thanks to a combination of direct subsidies and generous tax exemptions available to public, non-profit and private entities."
 
"Germans kept renting because, in Germany, rental housing is kind of nice."
 
"Economists think German housing policy struck a much better balance between government involvement and private investment than in many other countries."
 
"Why is renting cheap in Germany? Well, even though the country’s policies might have been slightly more balanced than in other countries, its rental market is still robustly regulated"
 
"German law allows state governments to cap rent increases at no more than 15% over a three-year period."
 
"There’s another pretty simple reason Germans are less likely to own houses. The government doesn’t encourage it."
 
"the German approach to housing looks pretty good right now—even if, before the crash, the low homeownership rate was seen as an albatross around Germany’s economic neck."
 
"According to the OECD, more than 93% of German respondents tell pollsters they’re satisfied with their current housing situation. That’s one of the highest rates of any nation the rich-country think tank surveyed."
 
 

So bye bye to maybe three quarters of foreigners, PRs.
 
We will be the first country in the world that both private and public housing cannot be rented out and has zero investment value.
 
Not lose a bit. We are asking for our nation to say goodbye to the economies of the future. Who does this benefit?

Bro @OmOm, I like your proposed model.
 
My response was to some who proposed that either HDB or private homes or both should not be allowed to be rented.
 
But no thanks. Prefer to own than to rent. Needs a certain mindset to rent.

It seems most of the ladies working there lived together in the same flat.

Good post. I tried to find models to show that a country's economic driver shouldn't be based on real estate but couldn't and gave up responding to that idiot who kept missing the point. You're the better man than me.

Owning a property is making a commitment.
By getting every Singaporean to own their own home is to get every singaporean to commit to the country.  
 
As home values rise, home owners participate in the growth.
However, the only way to unlock or materialise this "growth" is to sell it.
Otherwise, it is really a roof over the head which provides shelter and comfort.
 
I see more foreigners benefitting in owning a HDB in Singapore than a Singaporean.
This is because, the foreigner can take his profits on the growth of HDB prices by seling and going back to his home country with a significant bundle of money.
 
For the Singaporean, he will have to be ready to sell his hdb and move out of singapore for retirement to "enjoy" the profits.  otherwise sell high buy high.  At best it allows the Singapore the possibility to upgrade.  And in upgrading, commit himself deeper and further to Singapore.
 
Compare this to a situation where homeownership is the exception rather than the norm.
Many people would have left the country to seek greener pastures. As it is seen in many examples in the world.
 
Homeownership is and has done what it is meant to do.
An absolutely solid plan by a man of great foresight. 
Make no mistake that it is no mistake.

Wise words indeed. Just one point to add based on my observations. 
 
Some foreigners and PRs might originally have the intention stated. I had a few colleagues belonging to that category. They held back from SG citizenship in the first few years here with the intention to make their pot and return.
 
But the strong currency here, the higher quality education and the safe environment here led to most (if not all) settling here permanently.
 
One even transferred foreign properties to kins to be eligible to buy HDB resale. But I guess retirement is still a possible option for them.

I am afraid I cannot agree to this. When you have PUBLIC housing that your own citizens took a whole life time to pay to have a roof over his head, it is no solid plan for him and his family.
 
Even if he finally complete the payment, that is the only 'saving' of his entire family. Whatever 'gain' from this investment, he would put it back for his next generation investment, which is another HDB but this time at a higher price because of his profit.

Original idea was good but when they started to talk about asset enhancement (paper gains for majority with only 1 HDB flat), to mark to market for new BTO and allow HDB prices to runaway at double or triple income growth rate, the policy sort of departed from its main objective of affordable home ownership for all except the rich.   
 
I thought they have already "policy shifted" on this one after 2011 (people also not stupid), especially for BTO flats, and have started to "raid the reserves" again?

Brother @Victor68, what HDB prices and what incomes are you referring to? If median income working towards an outskirt 4rm it should not be an issue at all. Several forummers here can testify. 
Baby boomer generation a lot of them were disadvantaged in education (and income) levels, but the flat prices and location they were avail to were much lower than today. Even amongst them, those who have bought flats generally had paid up their flats in their 40s and upgraded to new flats or resale flats at least once by their late forties.
 
The only one I know still servicing into his 60s was based on a single income (most of his years earning below $1000) bringing up three children who are all graduates.
 
The key gripe I believe is income level and opportunities rather than HDB prices. Current HDB policies also enable flexibility in use as assets for those who really need the income (room rentals) and there are those who are against this as well.
 
So is the proposal for very cheap HDB that can only be lived in and not be used in any other way? That also raises some issues with long term productivity.

Doesn't appreciation of home prices in fact encourage people to leave as well?
 
If my house is worth 2 mil, what is stopping me from selling it and going somewhere cheaper? Is it an unexplainable attraction to keeping my property?

I agree with T2 n Nazareth's thinking on home ownership giving us citizens a physical stake in our country n something to fight for as our precious assets are at stake. 
 
If one has the thinking that since my asset has peaked n so i monetize it n migrate, my thinking is that you won't be the type of citizen who will likely be interested in defending your soil in the first place cos whilst your assets r important, other stakes like family, friends, pride in your country of birth etc are equally at stake if not more so. Assets are just a physical stake whereas the others are a psychological one so IMO u need both to stand up for your country.
 
Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to knock those who migrated as being disloyal but likely they do not have enough of a psychological stake to want to stay n the enhanced physical stake helped them jump ship, my 2 cents only.....

People who would jump would jump whether assets up or down. Most of the time, their income, savings and occupations are the enablers.  
I knew someone who sold his hdb to set up a ranch in Malaysia due to asset appreciation. If prices become overly cheap again, you can bet your every cent his family will be back.

Know someone who recently BTO (via walk-in selection) a Punggol 5RM for $468K. The surrounding 5RM resales are going for $500K. Was surprised by the high price of BTO, has the days of BTO doubling (or almost double ) up upon MOP gone?

omg, where is this? Is this what is meant by delinking BTO from resale?

Doesn't appreciation of home prices in fact encourage people to leave as well?
 
If my house is worth 2 mil, what is stopping me from selling it and going somewhere cheaper? Is it an unexplainable attraction to keeping my property?

Yes correct, but there is always the lesser of the two evils and the better of the two goods.
 
Only if you have another home immediately to go to, then you will leave.
For a Singaporean who is not PR nor has family elsewhere, there is no reason to leave if his property aapreciates.  
For the foreigner, they can leave easily (psychologically and emotionally low attachment) once they have the money.
 
Thats what i mean.
I hope yousee it more clearly now

People who would jump would jump whether assets up or down. Most of the time, their income, savings and occupations are the enablers. 
 
I knew someone who sold his hdb to set up a ranch in Malaysia due to asset appreciation. If prices become overly cheap again, you can bet your every cent his family will be back.

Ever heard of outliers.  We are not talking about these.
 
Unless you tell me that at least half the Singaporean you know have left singapore after selling their hdb to go to malaysia to start a ranch.

Actually I agree largely with you. 
 
Was pointing out that outliers (people who would exit after appreciation) exist. They are likely to have specialised skills and have been planning the exit for years, waiting only for the best timing to go.
 
The key is gradual and stable appreciation I guess.

Your perspective is valid. However, we need to understand also that our past policies, in particular those in the first 30 years of independent Singapore, had strong emphasis on placing the country first, and the citizen second. This does not mean that the individual citizen is unimportant; rather, it is based on the premise that if there is no country, then there is no citizenry to talk about.
 
There are few things more powerful than emotional bondage, in this case the idea of a home to be defended by the individual and his need to protect his family. The continuous dependence on an ever-appreciating asset for one's nest-egg and its reliance on a prosperous nation creates tremendous impetus on the part of the individual to work hard for his nation, whose success then functions as a proxy for his family's well-being.
 
That the individual is actually now chained to the system becomes an sought-after objective rather than a negative side-effect as you have put it.
 
Although this is largely rooted in the concept of fear driving the person, it has been key in keeping entire generations of Singaporeans pushing hard for economic success that has since materialised. It is also key today in having the majority of our population rooted in Singapore, a sense of loyalty imposed more out of pragmatism (and practicality) than of nationalistic faith.
 
There is much danger in this model of social governance though. Should the continuous increase of the individual's home price become no longer achievable due to macroscopic economic shifts and socio-political changes, the bond that had once been so effective in keeping Singaporeans rooted here will flip and take on an opposite polarity.
 
This creates a repulsive force that will push the individual to seek alternative living environments that allow him to derive satisfaction based on the conditioning that he has been subjected to all his life.
 
 
I am afraid I cannot agree to this. When you have PUBLIC housing that your own citizens took a whole life time to pay to have a roof over his head, it is no solid plan for him and his family.Even if he finally complete the payment, that is the only 'saving' of his entire family. Whatever 'gain' from this investment, he would put it back for his next generation investment, which is another HDB but this time at a higher price because of his profit.

What produces individual loyalty to a country? If his family and friends are no longer residing in the country, would he still be loyal to it?
 
I agree with T2 n Nazareth's thinking on home ownership giving us citizens a physical stake in our country n something to fight for as our precious assets are at stake.If one has the thinking that since my asset has peaked n so i monetize it n migrate, my thinking is that you won't be the type of citizen who will likely be interested in defending your soil in the first place cos whilst your assets r important, other stakes like family, friends, pride in your country of birth etc are equally at stake if not more so. Assets are just a physical stake whereas the others are a psychological one so IMO u need both to stand up for your country.Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to knock those who migrated as being disloyal but likely they do not have enough of a psychological stake to want to stay n the enhanced physical stake helped them jump ship, my 2 cents only.....

If family n friends are no longer residing in the country, it becomes a push factor to leave as well, coupled with a good price for his physical stake n u get a double push factor. Fortunately for most citizens, chances of the first push factor is slim so the 2nd property factor will unlikely push us to monetise it n leave on its own. 
 
IMO, family n friends r the main stake n so to firmly entrench u, a physical stake is created to let u have a confirmed belonging to the country. This is a general view n of course there will always be exceptions from a minority who may have other prerogatives.

I think it is not so much loyalty as it is the inability to cash out quick enough in time of crisis, so no choice but to defend the assets.  If a house is sold,  one will not be as motivated to rescue it from a fire as compared to one that has got lots of money put into it since one can buy something like that elsewhere.

There is another perspective on foreign stakes in our properties. It constitutes another kind of national security if strategically positioned. I.e. If country X leader has a stake in our country (owning a building or choosing SG as a home for his family), it is much less likely to effect an attack on SG. So indirectly protecting our males by substantially lowering the chance of activation.

I made friends with several PRC gals in recent months because they happened to be working in my clients or business partners' companies as accounts gals or secretaries. Everyone of them are sharing HDB rooms with strangers of the same sex. I was rather taken aback by their frugal attitudes. One of them is paying $600 for a common room in CCK and I presume her roommate is paying the same amount. $1200 x 2 is $2400 for both common rooms. The master room can be rented out for $800-$1000 but lets just assume the lower figure of $800. Total rent collected is $3200 for a 4 room HDB flat. I believe this scenario is being played out in many parts of Singapore. My own next door neighbour has been renting out all her 3 bedrooms of her 4 room HDB flat for the past 15 years. If I had done the same for my 5 room flat and went to live with my in-laws in 2001, I would have earned about $500K in rental by now.
 
600 should be for 2 pax 1 room or 1 pax 1 room... not 600 each

still need to spend on car, restaurants, vacation, children's enrichment classes, taxes etc...
 
i think it should be 10% of monthly household income to be considered as affordable
