Hi all,
 
Would like to ask some questions regarding whether to apply for Bulid to order or Sale of balance flat.
 
1. Currently have a 5 room flat in woodlands. I am the sole owner. Taking bank loan. Left 11 yrs and $68K.
2. As a 2nd time applicant for HDB flat. Which one have a higher successful rate to get a new flat? Bulid to order or Sale of balance flat?
3. Also as a 2nd time applicant to apply for HDB flat. There will be a levy of $45K impose by HDB if i change new flat. Can i pay back HDB this $45K only after i sold away my old flat?
4. Let's say i am sucessful to get a flat, i need to pay 10% down payment and 1% to 3% of stamp fee and legal fee within 3 months after sucessful application. Can i do another mortage loan from bank using my current flat to get cash to pay for the down payment? Although i still own bank $68K.
 
Can any property agent or guru or expert help? Thank you!

The very first question I would be asking myself - WHY do you want to change?  Is there anything wrong with your current flat?  With a 5 roomer with only $68k left on mortgage why go looking for something new? 
 
An alternative MIGHT be to "sell" half shares in the flat to wifey to use her CPF to wipe out mortgage and then see what the two of you can do together to buy a Condo for rental (the market is dropping right now, so maybe prepare yourselves and start looking first)

2. In my opinion successful rate for sales of balance flat will always be much lower than BTO. Reason is applicants rate is always high and many people will want a flat that will complete earlier. These are leftover flats and the number of good units might not be many.
 
3. The resale levy payable is determined at the point of booking your second subsidised flat. You can pay the resale levy immediately at the point of resale, i.e. when selling your subsidised flat or defer the payment until you buy another flat from HDB. If you come under the previous resale levy policy and opt for this, an interest at the prevailing rate of 5% per annum will be charged.
 

4. you need to pay 10% of the purchase price of the flat as downpayment if you are taking a housing loan from the HDB or not taking any loan. You can use your CPF savings to make the downpayment. If your CPF savings are not enough, you will have to pay the balance in cash. For stamp duty you can pay using cpf or cash

That's nothing wrong with my flat. Minor reason- me and my wife wanna change new enviroment.
 
1. The main reason is to get some cashout from the sale of my 5 room flat as i am going to downgrade to new 4 room flat. Then wait for 5 yrs, we can buy private property for rental. This money keep for condo down payment.
 
2. Wife just became PR. About to start work next month. So no CPF yet. But with her starting to work next month, we can apply together and use both our CPF to pay for our new 4 room flat. Than hope can get some precentage of HDB loan for the new flat.

It's really not my place to be giving you advice, and it is probably worth about as much as you are paying for it....
 
BUT (nothing counts before the but) 
 
I would not be downgrading if I were in your situation. Why go from a five room to a four room?  Later got kids, got inlaws, that extra space is going to a huge difference... and when the kids are starting to play, do homework etc it also makes a big difference
 
We currently have a five room - I couldn't imagine living in a four room WITH FAMILY - we often host 10-15 pax for festival lunch etc etc, that extra space makes a really big difference. 
 
A $68k mortgage is virtually nothing... 
 
Yeah, take the cash from the downgrade etc etc - but in a falling market?  BTO is probably "trailing" the fall, won't be ready for 3 years and you are paying price of today BTO, but HAVE to sell your five roomer at 3 year later price - where will the price be then?  Who really knows, all we now right now is that price is falling. 
 
That leaves "balance of flats" - this is really a "crap shoot" IMHO - if you find something you like, at a suitable price, then maybe worth it. 
 
But again - I personally wouldn't be downgrading if I were you. 
 
If REALLY REALLY want a change of environment - have you considered renovating?  A "clean sweep" through the house with new paint, some new decor might be just what the doctor ordered?

Hee...
 
68k at 2.5% over 25 years is $300 per month in repayments....
DBS don't even offer a mortgage that low..... (their minimum is $80k)

Thnaks for the advice in point 2 and 3. But as of point 4, i don't have so much cash on hand to pay the 10% down payment. My cpf ordinary account also $0 due to i using it to pay for my current loan every month. Wife going to start work next month. So also no CPF to pay for the down payment. Therefore i am asking can i do another mortage loan from bank or HDB using my current flat although i still have an outstanding loan of $68K. Thanks

Note - 
 
Wifey NEW PR, that means for year 1 her CPF contribution very low, (maybe 4-5%) year two I think around 10%, year 3 12%, only year four does she get full amount (I can't remember exactly, but it is graduated - go and check) 
 
$0 in Ordinary + no savings? 
 
Bear in mind that for BTO you will have to make progressive payments as well as servicing your current loan....SOME of these payments will have to be made before you can sell your current flat...

Bro,
 
My advice.. Don't sell. stay put. finish your mortgage. 68k is not a big number to settle. resale market now very unpredictable albeit low priced.. one month of sale period now got diff of at least 25k.. same area some more.. do check out hdb for median price transacted..
 
Furthermore, since your cpf is zero, try to see out the mortgage.. at least you have a small sum of money.. woodlands 5rm min sale price is 430k. I'm not sure where you might be going next but to downgrade to a 4rm, you have to deduct 45k from that 430k.. then deduct another 65k for the old mortgage. you're left with 320k..
 
You would have only 320k to play around with. if you plan to pay full for your new house (bto or sobf) its ok. you would probably have some money in the pocket after simple reno. Resale you can't do so.. still need top up.. very dangerous if you dont have cpf to back you up.. or extra savings for the matter..
 
My calculations may not be accurate but the idea is there.. the idea of cashing out is not feasible imho.. wait it out.. have a bit of savings in your cpf. garmen give you phantom money, might as well use it..

Hi,
 
You have calculated correct. I only have 320K to play around if i got new flat after paying my outstanding loan from bank and the resale levy. Most of the selling price of new 4 room is around $250K to $300K according to HDB website Therefore hope that i can get a HDB loan of $200K whereby me and my wife will use our CPF to pay. Hope that we can have $200K hard cash on hand, than wait for 5 yrs before we went to get a condo. We can than use this $200K for the condo down payment and renovation. Thanks

Haha, I was just having the same discussion with my wife this morning when I received HDB sms on the BTO and sales of balance flat. saw a couple of units which I am quite interested.
 
First of all, HDB is not a property owned, therefore, we are unable to mortgage to the bank, we can only refinance the balance of remaining loan. So your idea of "selling" part of your current flat to the bank and use the cash to finance your purchase of new BTO and sales of balance flat is not a valid option.
 
Secondly, like what many bros mentioned here, like me, you only have a portion of insignificant loan remains, why get yourself into another big financial commitment for 20-25 years. I am assuming here so if I am wrong, please pardon me. You are trying to max out your new purchase loan so that you can have more cash on hand from your cash proceeding after you sold your current flat. At such, assuming you are looking at 4 room, that is $300k+ unit. So if you are taking 80% loan, you are easily looking at $1000+ mortgage instalment monthly. With CPF contribution capped at $5000, I am seeing cash payment on top of CPF monthly. This is definitely no good in my opinion for HDB purchase.
 
Thirdly, if you do read up on HDB website. You need to apply for HLE (Housing Loan Eligibility) This is mandatory if you are taking HDB loan, If you are going bank loan path then it is fine. If your wife just obtained PR and only starting work next month (my wife is PR as well) I reckon the better option is for both of you to stay put and save up first.
 
Lastly, if you are considering private property investment, I believe by having a lower TDSR you have better chance in getting loan.
 
Do consider carefully. Property purchase is really a big commitment especially for commoners like us:)
why everyone must buy condo for second property?  
 
got condo as second property jin satki one in Singapore:)

Umm yeah, you might want to rethink your cunning plan. Right now the property market is heading in a clear direction and as Darryn said you need to consider the lag time involved. You might not even be able to "cash out" anything down the road based on the current BTO prices and future resale prices. Worse still you might find yourself needing to top up if you can't sell your current place easily/at your expected price.
 
My advice is sit tight, build up your piggy bank (esp since your wife will start work soon and can begin building her cpf too) and maybe you can consider getting a private property in the future when you have enough spare cash and rent out your HDB.
 
Look on the bright side, you already have an older and larger 5-room over your head with the mortgage well on the way to being paid up. A lot of people out there would love to be in your shoes. Spend some (or a lot) of money on renovation/furnishings and you can have a very nice pad.

Besides ...
 
for second property in Singapore you have three options
1. Condo
2. Landed (whether terrace, semi D or bungalow) 
3. Commercial
 
So then how? 
 
Also remember - for housing loan now got maximum payment that can be made from CPF (133% of purchase price?)...once hit that, then must pay in cash...
 
If maxing out the loan and the term - you may will hit the max payment limit further down the track (just something to consider)

TS, think you should take Darryn advise, stay put. 
 
By the time your bto flat is ready will 4-5yrs later, another MOP of 5yrs will be 2023. 
 
If really want condo, save up now. 
Besides, woodland may not fetch good resale price. Buy new flat, need to spend cash to renovate & buy new stuff, probably 30-100k depending on what you want.

Since TS paid for 1st flat using cpf, the money has to be returned to cpf + accrued interest over the years. So, money on hand may be lesser than thought.
 
Also, if plan is to buy 2nd property, note that the amt of loan will be lower due to TDSR and another important thing- downpayment is 40% if you are still servicing your 1st home loan. So unless you can save enough moolah, else dif.

Thanks for all the advises about changing flat! By the way i saw this from the HDB website.
 
 
For my case, will i be consider as first timer when applying for flat under "Couples comprising First timer and second timer"? I am currently having a 5 room flat as a sole owner. I am using bank loan with no CPF grant when i bought my flat as i not not married yet at that time.
Now me as a 2nd timer, but my wife as a PR is a 1st timer. So by right under this statement, we are consider as 1st time applicant right?
If we are consider as 1st timer, do i still need to pay a Resale Levy to HDB?? Need advise. Thanks

You are considered a 1st timer if you have not bought direct from HDB or resale HDB with CPF grant or taken part ownership of a direct HDB purchase flat from your family. If you bought your current 5rm HDB from open market with no grant, then 100% consider 1st timer with your spouse, no need pay any resale levy

No, i bought my current flat direct from HDB through walk in selection last time. But looking at the statement of "couples comprising First timer and second timer" I am a 2nd timer, but my wife is a 1st timer. So by looking at the statement, we are consider as 1st timer right?

You're conflating two different things
 
For the purposes of PRIORITY only,you are a first timer.  So you get more chances in the ballot
 
For the purposes of LOAN / LEVY you are considered a second timer as have already "enjoyed" a subsidy from HDB. 
 
BTW - think very very carefully about the levy that you will pay when / if you downgrade.  This is "dead" money - it is like paying a fine, the money is wasted. 
 
Is it really worth giving $40k to the govt to "free up" what might be less than $100k cash?

No, i bought my current flat direct from HDB through walk in selection last time. But looking at the statement of "couples comprising First timer and second timer" I am a 2nd timer, but my wife is a 1st timer. So by looking at the statement, we are consider as 1st timer right?

 
 
how can a single walk in to buy direct from HDB 5 room flat?

Yes, can. Provided whole family stay together as occupant. I was 26yr old at that time. This was their policy last time.
 

You're conflating two different things
 
For the purposes of PRIORITY only,you are a first timer.  So you get more chances in the ballot
 
For the purposes of LOAN / LEVY you are considered a second timer as have already "enjoyed" a subsidy from HDB. 
 
BTW - think very very carefully about the levy that you will pay when / if you downgrade.  This is "dead" money - it is like paying a fine, the money is wasted. 
 
Is it really worth giving $40k to the govt to "free up" what might be less than $100k cash?  

 
Hmmmm..... So we will be consider as 1st time applicant to have more chances in balloting. But still need to pay resale levy. This was what i think of also.

P.S - all of this should be confirmed with the actual people at HDB...
 
And also - if they don't make sense the first time, follow up again

I guess TS applied with his parents And he is registered as the sole owner with his parents listed as occupant. So considered one time liao. It seems that his main objective is to take out cash as he prob bought it cheap last time and if that is the case, the only way is to sell and get another unit. I think after the levy, plus agent fees for sellinh, plus reno, and returning the portion of CPF plus interest, the cash on hand may be limited. A lot depends on his long term plans to make the call.

i doubt hdb has a policy for single to buy new flat on his own, you must have co-own it with one of your parents.
 
pardon me asking where are they going to stay if you are selling this flat?

Yes, they had it last time.But it was more than 10 yrs ago. I didn't co-own with parents. I registered as a sole owner and my parents as occupants. My parent going to move in together with me and my wife in our new flat if we are successful to apply new flat. But this time round will be me as Owner and wife as co-owner.

1 of my friend who is also single around my age knew that i had successfully bought a new flat from HDB through walk in system also went to applied. He was successful too. That time we bought our flat cheap. I bought mine 5 room in woodlands for $180K only.

There was such a policy back then.. think about 7 yrs back. Nonetheless, if the TS decides to buy an HDB again, he need not pay back CPF plus accrued interest. ONLY if just selling, then need to pay back. This is also if you used the CPF during the 1st time wipeout after you sign on the dotted line. The monthly instalments no need pay back. If used bank loan for the initial lump sum payment and subsequently use CPF to service the monthly, also no need to pay back. Just called in twice to confirm as well. Maybe I should double check again. Their CSO also very blur and not steady.
 
To TS, if really wanna cash out also no point.. You will be throwing away at least 45k for levy, 7k for agent fees (buy/sell), 35k for new house reno. That's about 77K. Your probable selling price for your 5rm also may fetch 430-440k. Settling your bank loan another 65k. That leaves you with at least 430k-45k-7k-35k-65k = 280k. If you really wanna have some cash in hand, you will have to look at ulu places that sells sobf at 240k, that is low floor, blocked view and maybe facing centralised rubbish chute. Do you think that extra 40k in your pocket is worth it?
 
Plus, you have to wait the 5 yrs MOP before you can sell your new place. And by that time, we'll never know had bad or good the market is. And if you happened to settled for the place that I've described to you due to unforeseen circumstances, trust me, you'll have difficulties to sell off at a price you would want.
 
As of all our advices here are the same, I agree that you should stay put and finish off your 68k loan. And if you happened to start a family, its not gonna be as tough bro. One less headache. Just gotta be patient. With so many condos sprouting up like taugeh, once you settle your loan, save up a bit more, you may get a worthy property for investment..

Yup that's right.
 
Good luck to your balloting!
 
I tried to apply for the last 2 BTO (despite considering as first timer for both my wife and myself, I did not even get a ballot number) Guess Sengkang and Punggol are hot town now:)

I think the CSO who advised you is very wrong. Whenever we sell our HDB, we have to pay back CPF plus accrued interest. CPF payback is top priority in Singapore Govt point of view as it is supposed to be our retirement fund. We are not supposed to touch it beside for housing and medical needs. So after you signed on the dotted line for your next purchase, they will again wipe out your entire CPF before calculating your loan and monthly instalment again. That is why I mentioned earlier that it is risky to fund a $1000+ instalment when CPF contribution is capped at SGD5000 your monthly salary. Meaning, you have to top up cash most of the time.
 
This is one major deterring factor for me when I was considering changing flat for the same reason as TS.

My exact sentiments.. Anyway their lead CSO got back to me already. The CPF need to pay back with accrued interests only for principal amount.
 
Taken from CPF web:
 				Q:							Is there any accrued interest on the amount used for the purchase of my property?						A: 							Yes, interest will accrue on the amount of CPF savings that you have used towards the purchase of your property. You are required to refund the accrued interest together with the principal amount withdrawn when you sell/transfer the property.		 
Once paid back, and CPF has already acknowledged, you can use the CPF money again for next purchase. Now waiting for CPF answer as well. Sometimes, need to confirm both agencies tally or not. I ask my agent friend also, this one grey area.. Hence he prefer dealing private props and not hdb/cpf.. because everytime change policy one..

OK, the CPF CSO called back liao.. The CPF you used initially need to pay back with accrued interest. This will be credited back to your OA. Once CPF acknowledges full payment of the borrowed funds from CPF, you can use them again to buy another property. This is to my understanding from what the CSO tell me. Maybe you guys can try call in also and share whether this info is confirm or not.. 
 
In other words, the 2 earlier ones I called in to put it in layman's terms for me to understand.. But then, I can't find any sense to as why we need to put back in our OA then use it again later.. interest earned is our own also mah..
 
Now I'm the one who needs enlightenment...

basically CPF and HDB regulation has not changed much from the last time I obtained my real estate licence. Put it simply in layman term.
 
CPF monies = Govt Monies (Yes! It is not ours yet)
So Govt Monies always goes back first to govt when it is available:)

Here is my take. A lot of advise given are based on certain assumptions which only you will know.
 
Worth or not just look at it this way. 
 
How much profit you get get after selling your flat.  Less 45K for levy and less 30k for reno less 8k for agent comm and less 10k for legal fees. This already close to 100k. Easy maths in deciding whether to change.
What is this figure? 100k, 150k, 200k?
 
Now look at the bto flat. How much is a similar resale unit selling for? 100K discount compared to bto? This is the important factor cos if discount not high might ad well buy resale and not pay any levy. 
 
Waiting 3-5 years for bto flat not relevant cos many sale of balance flats are ready to move in type. Already completed. 4 rooms can be had for 300k or below. Of cos cheap sure got many bad points la.

TS don't be angry but I do agree with Piyopico.. 
 
It's sounds damn silly to pay some stupid resale levy of 45k to HDB for some BTO... 
 
And how soon will they complete the flat?? Do u know a lot of projects are delayed due to labour crunch.. 
 
If u tell me u are getting some Dawson or boon Keng area at 300k for 4 room BTO.. Then fine.. Pay $45k levy, got a good location at fantastic price bec sure beat woodlands for the location.

Someone told me before ... and he is an American and not a housing agent,,, there are 3 words to a good property .... the three words are location, location and location... I agree with you to apply for a unit in a mature estate ... if I have the opportunity again ... I would go and try my luck. I absolutely love the new flats that they are building in Dawson .....Sky Ville and Terrace.
 
TS,
 
I dont think that it is a bad idea to cash out on your current flat but go for a better location .... forget about the BTO.
 
As for condo. investment etc ..... live the present .... make the decision when you reach that point. As it is, property in Singapore is still one of the best way to make some money. Nothing venture nothing gain ... but there is a risk. How long would it take you to save 200 thousands ?
 
 
Just my 2 cents.

New flat also need to think, nowsadays a lot of complaints about poor quality construction/finishing/workmanship etc. Plus your living space gonna be reduced by downsizing to a new-generation, smaller 4-room flat. It's not just about the number of rooms, it's about the useable space or lack thereof in newer projects compared to older flats.
 
If your parents are going to stay with you and kids come along, do you really want to squeeze a three-generation family into a modern 4-room BTO just to cash out a little bit in an uncertain market?

Hi,
 
You have calculated correct. I only have 320K to play around if i got new flat after paying my outstanding loan from bank and the resale levy. Most of the selling price of new 4 room is around $250K to $300K according to HDB website Therefore hope that i can get a HDB loan of $200K whereby me and my wife will use our CPF to pay. Hope that we can have $200K hard cash on hand, than wait for 5 yrs before we went to get a condo. We can than use this $200K for the condo down payment and renovation. Thanks
 
 

thats an ideal case which i think is relatively difficult....
 
along this 5 yrs, u dont know wads the property inflation like... although its a current down trend now...
area along kovan prices went up almost 100% from 600-700 psf to current 1200-1300 psf...
 
with the TDSR, even harder to get loan...
 
my colleague income 80k per yr, without an loan repayment obligations every mth... bank indicated loan max value only 600k... and she is young, only 30yrs old...
 
things are getting tougher n tougher

unless you are getting a 2 room hdb flat, I would say forget it.
