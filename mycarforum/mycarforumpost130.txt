The garmen knows market is not sustainable at that rate. With the market slowing down, here they came up with the 6.9Mil to keep the market hot. There are currently many are staying in private condos and renting out their HDB. Used to be 16k units of HDB rented out on 2006. Now you have 44k units rented out, which made up 9% of total HDBs in Singapore. What these ppl do, they use the rental from HDB to fund their private condos.
 

Many have also complain too many, HDBs are rented out to FTs. So far nothing have done to curb this area. HDB have start to study this area. So this is something worth watching. I believe more curbs to come in near future. Especially in use of HDB. This will definitely impact mass market condos.

It will impact hdb more. Pte condo depends on seller wana lower price. But once hdb rule cannot use for rent，many pte owners will sell low their hdb.

agents nowadays act like gangsters, they corner entire blocks n stake their claim so that other agents cant get access. They want to "possess" as many units as possible so that they look like big time agents & also take pictures of your unit without permission then use for advertising. I wont give her chance when it comes to defects.

But I heard from my honest MY agent, that the real value was not there. Especially the zone A and B. This was bought up by Singaporeans and other foreigners. Telling me, buying an luxury serviced Apt of RM700 - RM1Mil, are all over priced. Any trigger of instability of the economy or political changes, these are the first ones will get hit badly. I was thinking of letting go this property, but the environment and the rental yield is so great that hold me back. 

For those who bought during 2002 - 2005, have really made a fortune out of it. Back in Singapore, while I sold my   Citylights during end 2011, only made a pure profit of $350+K.

Gahmen wants to clamp down on shoebox shops in malls.
 

Maybe there are good reasons for last year's clamp-down on shoebox condos, but I thought as long as shoppers and retailers like shoebox shops, these shops should be left alone?  
 

Shoebox flats could be too small for healthy family living, but shoebox shops are just commercial spaces, if shoppers don't like them, they will die a natural death anyway, why the interference?

of course it is upbeat mah..
 

unemployment down from 10% to now 7.7% leh! very sudden and sharp improvement 
 

People are now feeling happier and richer, even though most may only be working part time or as fast food fryer  
 

Plus uncle Ben promised to print and print until unemployment rate is down to 6.5%  
 

And income growth for bottom 90% of america since 1966 is at an ultra high of $59!

How about MyManhattan at Simei asking $1300 psf? Squarish plot flanked by MRT track on one side, main road on the other side, and a school on yet the other side. The plot is so small that noise from any of these three sources would possibly be heard by everyone. For that, I really wonder what gong-tao they put to get buyers to sign on the line?

Maybe they all thought the surroundings is exactly what those "artist impression" pictures they put in newspaper and TV advert.

Condo all round surrounded by green tress and unblocked with no other buildings in near sight. Everyday sip kopi look out the window see sunset, chill at the pool that is not crowded like fish market at all, only a few friendly household share the entire condo facilities...

Aiyah.... got to live up to the "Manhattan" word in the name mah!
 

So try to replicate the Manhattan feel and noise lor!  Subway one side, inner city school (without the bang bang bang) on the other, busy and noisy main road (like the 5th avenue) in front!
 

If the surroundings are green, serene and tranquil, it cannot be named MyManhattan lah!

govt want to enjoy the bullish property market ma.
 

slapping stamp duty allows themselves to earn in the midst of it and yet reduce demand a bit.  but in terms of effectiveness, it is not going to be more effective than a direct control based on quota of property in each person's name.
 

and now, an offspin of such policy is that couples are busying doing decoupling of their property ownership to allow themselves to buy more property.

probably w such malls w different landlords being it is harder to find tenants and for all tenants to open business together.
 

look at Thomson V2, there are about 80 shop units owned by different investors...the mall is still near empty....

haha , no la , some people needs to be put in place . Recently lots of jokers all coming out to post all those s--t about paying full cash la , make how much on properties , preaching on how others should spend their money la . 
 

Always wondering , how others spend , leverage , what has it got to do with them ?  As if that if one over leverage , cannot make repayment , will confirm go and seek a loan from them ?? All talking like as if they own banks or finance house , any defaults will hit their own pockets  
 

Used to enjoy coming into this forum to read and seek advices on cars related matters , but these days seems that it has become a playground for people to come in and boast about how much they pay in income taxes la , full cash for cars and all those s--t ... 
 

anyway , enough of my ranting , you have a good day .

Full cash for car expense=prudent. Full cash for property= could do better with some leverage since its a long term appreciating asset unlike cars.

it's time to have a definitive classification of what is poor, middle and rich in MCF.
 

Once and for all.
 

so no one will come and say i think i am middle, middle upper,. middle upper lower blah blah
 

I propose:
 

Poor - below 20Kpa

Middle - 20k to 10m pa

Rich - above 10m pa
 

So everyone is now middle class. No need to argue anymore

How can someone owning so many expensive sports cars be considered middle class?
 

If you mean your net worth is somewhere in the middle between the absolute richest person in Singapore and the absolute poorest person, probably you are right.
 

But to say that you belong to the middle class segment out of the entire Singapore population because of this, is wrong.
 

I suggest you go read up statistics and learn what is mean, median, mode and range before you make stupid statements like you are middle class.

How can anyone in the top 5% be considered middle class?
 

The other 95% of the population leh?  Cannot even smell your Ferrari even if they worked all their lives.
 

So how can you say you are middle class?
 

I think what is wrong is your terminology. 
 

Like I said: you are probably worth somewhere in between the richest guy in singapore and the poorest guy.
 

However, the majority of people are worth way below your net worth, including most of the millionaires in singapore.
 

So based on % of population, you are way above 95% of Singaporeans.
 

That itself excludes you from being considered a member of the middle class.
 

You see, it is all based on proportion of the population, not absolute net worth on a scale of 1 to 10. That is erroneous.
 

And by the way, $500k a year is comfortable, not rich, still have to work as a slave to afford the things we want.

Why can't i consider middle class when i do not think that i have much net worth ?? Seriously do not know what is your problem ....  
 

Drive Ferrari / Lambo must be high net worth or upper class people ?? There are lots of middle class like myself who owns a couple of cars and just happens to enjoy driving exotics and spend most of our money on cars ... 
 

Different people have different priorities and views on how about going spending their hard earn money . Some rather spend on buying big houses , nice condo , exotic holidays or exotic cars . 
 

Know of a close friend whom took 3 years to save up 120k , spend it all on a safari holiday @ SA with his wife . That 120k can be a year of depre for a nice used exotic ride but he just prefers to spend it on something else .

Not suprising. Higher end resorts can be in the thousands of USD per night, plus not forgetting all the extras for activities. Even in our region also the fancy places like banyan tree villas etc can make a quick long weekend getaway cost a few thousand. Plus if you're taking a nice holiday you'll probably want to fly business class at least.
 

A few years back i took a long-awaited family holiday to Queensland with my parents and we ended up spending 30+k for a 10 day trip. Nothing exotic but just did/ate/bought whatever we wanted without bothering about costs. That was a good trip.

And therefore, it answers the question.
 
I have already repeated many times.
Buyers of such developments are mass market buying to stay with a quantum below $2mil.
Probably sold HDB or at best hv one fully paid HDB.
Whether full cash or not doesnt matter.
She probably has no bullets liao. How many will she buy or should i ask , can she buy?
 
If want to buy, must also sell first right?
If want to sell, prefer to sell high or sell low?
 
So where is the market heading? You tell me lah.

Loan default cycles is often linked to poor asset prices. Property prices are probably stagnant at the moment where the buyers not willing to buy at current prices and the seller not willing to take a steep price cut.
 
It is only when job market conditions turn bad and defaults start to rise before property prices will drop.
 
Sales for property agents on the other hand will experience slowdowns as "easy" money dry up. It is unlikely that the high "overheads" are squeezing the agents and not the buyer and seller market.

Needless to say, if lose job confirm headache.But even if dont lose job, hopefully the buyers of these investment units dont calculate their affordability base on rentals at very rosy rates relying solely on them to cover the loan instalments
 
Imagine if they did and if they cant rent, upfront cash outlay would be required.
Even if they can rent but at a rate more lower then their very rosy expectations (painted by the agents)
The rent wont cover the instalments.
 
Add that to the increasing loan rates and we could see some belt tightening.
Add that to downpnward pressures on price and valuation now and we could see some buttons bursting.
 
Importantly, when markets move, it waits for no one.  on the way up and more so on the way down .
It is not ONLY when job conditions turn bad for defaults to occur before prices start dropping.
No no, definitely not only.

Oh...that means you must have bought one on high leverage? 
So everyone is advising you to be careful?
 
Its ok lah, at most lose money, work harder and save more, tighten belt a bit.

my first 2 property was bought on high leverage. had no choice then
 
but the loan quantum got lower with the subsequent properties...
 
I was one of the lucky few who bought and sell during the right time..
 
not a guru but I do know a thing or 2 about the property market...hence my reaction towards other people's comments that sounds naïve....

It is like a domino effect , the private sector would affect upgraders/downgraders alike and it is likely to trickle down to hdb sales.
 
Typicallly the "pain" is always on the speculators with shallow pockets , for those with deep pockets , they will think property prices will eventually match , meanwhile a 1~4% rental income would be good. But those buggers won't be buying hdbs anyway.

If you were lucky to buy during upswing and made money, thats great. good for you.Being naive is thinking that the property market is a one way street up the hills of twinpeaks.
 
If you know a thing or two, plse kindly share.
Otherwise, like you say, you're lucky.
Even my next door 67 yr old aunty was lucky.
Not to mention my colleague who was lucky
And also my ex classmate, equally lucky.

Can i just say based on my opinion , the mass market yet to feel the heat , the prime is almost there , only probably the SNW nothing happen.
 
See if garmen will hike rates or not. It is always the cost of capital that is the killer. There is always a saying , when you owe the bank a million it is your problem , when you owe the bank many millions it is the bank's problem.

Was at the WaterFront @ Faber show flat last weekend. 
Accessibility CMI ... so deep in, must have 2-3 cars, but one unit allocated only 1 parking space!
Parents go work, children all walk in (if no school bus).
 
Even driving home from city will need to pass through very congested Clementi Central ... especially the gridlock area at MRT station, bus stop, taxi stands, cars awaiting, bus terminus around the corner, vehicles criss-crossing and heavy influx coming from AYE and PIE, via Avenue 6!  Very chaotic and daily headache man, that area!
 
They advertise grandiose water front view ... go there I only see canal longkang view leh! :-P
 
But more interestingly, there was a long queue of housing agents waiting for viewers to arrive.
They take turns that way, like tikam tikam!
A$$ luck, they wait so long and get viewers who only come and look see, with no intention to buy.
Then they have to join in the long queue again, to await their next turn to serve!
Hern ke lian woh!

Local properties mostly have canal views but advertised as water feature or water front view. Some owners like to boast they have pool view. What is so nice about watching screaming children running about in the pool? Worse.. you see a floating corpse once in a blue moon.

And bathrooms to all-German Duravit sanitaryware and Hansa faucets / shower can or not?
 
Or you ask developer not to install these and I ownself sub-contract.

Local properties mostly have canal views but advertised as water feature or water front view. Some owners like to boast they have pool view. What is so nice about watching screaming children running about in the pool? Worse.. you see a floating corpse once in a blue moon.

 
hahaha, i share the same view as you about pool view, except for the floating corpse remark. 
 
maybe many hope that there will be gorgeous bikini babes at the pool but the reality is screaming kids and fat aunties/uncles (esp if your condo has a high percentage of ang mo). 
 
every weekend noisy like a waterpark. want peace and quiet also cannot.

It matters as it impacts the valuation done by a professional valuer.

wonder how's the feeling of the >60% buyers now

Was at the WaterFront @ Faber show flat last weekend.
 
Accessibility CMI ... so deep in, must have 2-3 cars, but one unit allocated only 1 parking space!
Parents go work, children all walk in (if no school bus).
 
Even driving home from city will need to pass through very congested Clementi Central ... especially the gridlock area at MRT station, bus stop, taxi stands, cars awaiting, bus terminus around the corner, vehicles criss-crossing and heavy influx coming from AYE and PIE, via Avenue 6! Very chaotic and daily headache man, that area!
 
They advertise grandiose water front view ... go there I only see canal longkang view leh! :-P
 
But more interestingly, there was a long queue of housing agents waiting for viewers to arrive.
They take turns that way, like tikam tikam!
A$$ luck, they wait so long and get viewers who only come and look see, with no intention to buy.
Then they have to join in the long queue again, to await their next turn to serve!
Hern ke lian woh!
Nowsaday housing agent oso chin pai tan!!!

 
 
I rem more than 1/2 year ago, agents were standing outside showroom by the road side waving at every car that passed by
 
also it is almost empty at Hillion showflat, agents stood outside smoking chit chatting

I agree. I prefer to face some quiet area, unblocked if possible.
 
Can't stand those situated right in the center "facing facilities" and your view to the left is the block opposite, ditto your view to the right.

I think all the 99-yr leasehold properties in OCR and outskirts will die first.
Too much recent supply sold at ridiculous prices!
Pants on fire!!!  Anxiety will lead to desperation ...
More still being built :-O
 
What will hold off a bit longer are the prime D9/10 Freehold, or EIPs.
But then, if another financial crises hits, even these will succumb!

For me i long say liao , lol for those with cash it is better to wait. Especially with the increase in CPF and how the jokers at the top is playing ,i am pretty sure more price adjustments ahead. Since last year i have already warn people liaoz.
 
At least 3-5 years of down cycle and more if the ruling party start to lose power but that said , the 3rd gen already started to take their money and run already leaving the pile of shit to the 4th gen.
 
Just look at the amount of multi millionaires politicians they created , i am sorry for those which bought the property last year and this year , your plight would be even more clear in due time.

its amazing how crazy property prices had been.
 
previously i wasn't bothered with property so i wasn't really keeping track of prices.
 
during lunch with my business associate today, he mentioned how he was offered 1.8k psf at The Glades when it was launched and now it dropped to about 1.6k psf.
 
i was like ??? 1.6k psf for such a location? 
 
and J Gateway at average 1.5k psf??

This is to be mitigated with getting the chance to get your "ideal" home.
I for one am willing to pay a slight premium now and not try and catch the bottom.
This, in order to secure the unit I want, in the development I like, as long as it's within my means.
 
Sure, prices might come tumbling down but the units available then might not interest me.
 
This kinda made sense in my head, dunno if I articulated it properly here...

To me an ideal home is one which i can clearly afford to pay off in cash. If one need to slog to "payoff" his debt , it doesn't matter , for those people which are caught , there are always plenty of reasons for their choice. If i have cash and i wait for prices to crash , it is just a matter when before people decides to bite the bullet.
 
Everyone makes a choice , whether if it is worth it depends on each individual , what i think it worth might not be the same for others.
 
To me , an apple is apple and a peanut is a peanut , why pay an apple's price for a peanut?
 

Job hazard , haha see too many sale personals to the point of disgust back in my dept.
 
 
 
By the way, never ask a "banker" whether their product is the best, instead look up the other banks to compare what they offer , due diligence is important , falling for one's showmanship would only result in investments which are likely to fail.
 
Anyway back to property . Looking forward , though property prices are unlikely to drop sharply but it is likely that there won't be much liquidity in the secondary markets as the ones holding on to their properties are unlikely to sell them. Unless one or two of the things below happen
 
1. Sharp hikes in interest (sibor rates)
2. Economic downturn resulting to mass corrections in multi asset classes
3. Sudden withdrawals of foreign investments from Singapore
4. War
5. Over supply of properties due to various reasons ( bankrupted developers/investors etc )

Well good for u. To me a home is one which i stay and don't intend to sell even if the price is right , to me i will exercise my right as a citizen and stay in the hdb which i am entitled to, an investment on the other hand is one which i have to sell when the price is right.
 
That said , each of their own.of coz you might have friends which has no need to bite the bullet , for me i have already sold what i wanted to sell and waiting for markets to crash which will happen and it is likely we will see an slow economic decline for the next 5 years at least. Maybe i won't even invest in sg for the upcoming 10~15 years.
 
Reason , i don't see any clear 5,10,15,20 year plans of what development our leader is intending to do , nothing is being built , no plans and no hype , nothing.
 
Tell me la a simple thing like a labor problem our clown leadership cannot even solve, how to plan big thing,

In your view, what do you think the recovery from this correction will look like? A V-shape recovery like 2009, a U-shape recovery, or a L-shape(aka no hope for recovery)? What's your take on this?

It doesnt matter whether you sell or not becos the resale market doesnt quite lead the prices.
Moreover prices are a function of valuation and valuation is?  Just an amalgamation of situations both hard and soft.  
 
So you can continue to keep as long as you can continue to pay your mortgages but the prices will still move as they should.    In other words, you may come off unharmed simply becos you ride the wave.
Thats great. We will all be happy for you.  But your not selling with a few friends is far from a determining element.  Or shall i say , a representation of the overall market, and even if every single resale guy out there doesnt sell, prices will still drop. Why?
 
Becos the determining factor would be the humongous supply of new units  and the CMs.
That will drive valuations and prices deep down.  
Developers cant wait for tides to turn, the situation and environment is different today.  
The cost of holding is too high today.
Every single one of them is dying to throw their units out now,.
The earlier they can launch, the better. Taking a small cut is better than having a limb severed.
 
What is certain is a loss of opportunity and if big enough sometimes thats all that makes the difference.
The person who bought at the high will have to face this loss of opportunity.
 
"Just keep lor" becos there's nothing you can do anyway, thats the reason.
 
Akin to stock trading. If you bought at the high and have no more bullets, just keep lor.
 difference is that property doesnt have similar liquidity as stocks but got a much longer shelf life than stocks and wont go to nothing. So lucky you .
 
Dont get me wrong, am not against you or anyone.

"Just keep lor" becos there's nothing you can do anyway, thats the reason.
 
Akin to stock trading. If you bought at the high and have no more bullets, just keep lor.
difference is that property doesnt have similar liquidity as stocks but got a much longer shelf life than stocks and wont go to nothing. So lucky you .
 
Dont get me wrong, am not against you or anyone.
Just sharing the hard truths. And the right perspective of looking properties.

 So harsh lol , i have warned since long ago , no one listen to me. Won't the ah long lending them the money know more than the common property agent which are all lurking all over here. Just make a little money nia they suddenly become gurus . Now see how many gurus become goondos.
 
Many many driving bmws and audis, see how good the repo market in 6mths time, time to get a new bmw or audi. Confirm plus guarantee they lose until drop pants and for banks it is likely their strategy is to scrap immediately.
 
If they know the assets cycles and where it is going , they will probably be multi multi millionaires by now.

Not harsh lah...
 
If he only has one property covering his head, of course just keep lor.
Its for own stay and to move on in life, i said already.
If that is his investment property, see whether he just keep lor or not.
If he does, he either has a lot a lot a lot of money or he is some hell of an investor lor.
My guess is, he has a lot a a lot a lot of money....

If he pay full cash , maybe , haha else , aiyo i dunno say how many times. Unless you bought like me at 300~400 psf or even as low at 200+ psf for a lowly freehold condo at balestier maybe it is more worth it to keep. Else keep ? Ideal home ? LOL unless he staying in sentosa cove lor.
 
Never ever play with property that you stay in , never ever take a home loan other than from cpf and never "roll" your home unless you have more than 1.
 
Else you end up with lesser money as compared to the one which sold and i dunno see how many of those which claims they have bought their "ideal" homes coming into my office asking for help.
 
At most hold lor , lol more like thats the most u can do .

Even for a meal, cannot just eat meat alone right?
Must eat various food groups for a healthy diet.
 
So that is why, i only hv one property now.

Like the used car dealers association after the 2013 CM, same will happen for real estate ... If not already.
The real estate developers association REDAS will form a team to negotiate with the MND and MAS for concessions, waivers and immediate relaxation of CM.
 
Good lah. Time to lose some money ... it cannot always be win-win for them right, as it used to be?

And after that, we'll see a mass exodus of real estate agents re-joining the labor market too!
 
Don't forget that these people had switched from their 'normal' jobs to the more-senang, big-payout property agency service.  Some do not even possess the basic skills, or business-relations / language acumen.
 
All they want is for you to close the deal.  Quickly.  Your marnee / commission is all that they want.
Low skills, but many driving posh luxury cars during the property boom.

Not end of the world i won't even bother for property prices. For those which mentioned 80s that is when singapore experienced the highest population growth going into workforce followed by a 20+ of straight growth,  now that we peaked and there is not pull factors with our elites running out of ideas to attract investors, do you think prices will go back up?
 
For those which think their property will always go up, yes in a stable environment. If the outlook isn't consistent I don't think so.
 
One example in the 90s bishan hdb sold for 900k til now after 20 years it is not even worth 3x more and if you count is based on inflation it is not even worth it.
 
Timing in property is very important

A property price drop not only affects those new buyers , it also affects existing owners via a asset revaluation,  should the bank decide that the asset in question is worth less they will ask the owners to cough out more money on top of a possible rate increase.  So those which thinks he can hold please remember to price those potential events
 
I have never fancy a 99 year property before unless it is dirt cheap like our HDBs which cannot be crawled back by anyone except HDB

Certain 99 year LH properties hold their values better than FH properties simply because of their location.

True, but it is just personal preference and ease of mind due to the nature of my work. 
 
There are certain 99yr lh which can hold value better but that belong to the minority and for their location.
 
As for most,  even if there is a location it doesn't guarantee their prices,  I cite an example "the sail" located in town is known for its location was launched at 800psf-900psf and went as high as 1800 or even higher if I am not wrong but the recent valuation for it was 1400 and below,  so location doesn't mean it guarantee your value.

I was just wondering would Spore be like HK in the near future? Prices of condo rocket like no tomorrow, and everywhere we would see condo.
 
If there is so many condo units, isn't condo going to replace HDB as standard sight all around us? Garmen just sell whatever land to private developers.
And if there are so many condos, would there be so many ppl staying? And wouldn't this lead to suppression of prices?
 
Maybe time to look at landed now?

Whether buying to stay or rentCondos and landed are two very different things.
They are also in different price categories.
Prices will come off further either ways, condos and/or landed.

For the good of the country, I hope property prices come down significantly.  A big component of costs is rentals. 
 
Hope so, but some landlord siao one (those commercial ones that I know of), anyhow raise rents for shops, sometimes asking for double the rent or more. One of my friend moving out coz his rental double from 5 to 10K, when another tenant with a larger outlet just two to three units down is getting it at 6K.. So he no choice.. =X
 
Hopefully demand drops enough that rental drops, and more unique type of businesses will be able to survive, instead of the current carbon copy type of businesses..
 

And after that, we'll see a mass exodus of real estate agents re-joining the labor market too!
 
Don't forget that these people had switched from their 'normal' jobs to the more-senang, big-payout property agency service. Some do not even possess the basic skills, or business-relations / language acumen.

Then labour supply too much, wages depressed again! Haha.. But then hor, really la, some property agent.. Can't work one.. Not all lah, but some..

If he pay full cash , maybe , haha else , aiyo i dunno say how many times. Unless you bought like me at 300~400 psf or even as low at 200+ psf for a lowly freehold condo at balestier maybe it is more worth it to keep. Else keep ? Ideal home ? LOL unless he staying in sentosa cove lor.
 
Never ever play with property that you stay in , never ever take a home loan other than from cpf and never "roll" your home unless you have more than 1.
 
Else you end up with lesser money as compared to the one which sold and i dunno see how many of those which claims they have bought their "ideal" homes coming into my office asking for help.
 
At most hold lor , lol more like thats the most u can do .

 
You are missing my point completely. It needs to be read in context with my earlier post.
 
Let me illustrate,
 
I've got 2 properties, one in Binjai which I'm staying in and I like and another for example some mass market condo in some suburb for investment.
IF you wanna buy my "investment" property, I sure sell sell sell in light of the market downtrending. On the other hand, if you wanna buy my "own stay" property, let's say I price it at 25 million (cos maybe for 25 million I can finally realize my dream of owning the yacht of my dreams or whatever reason) and I am not going to drop this price regardless of the general property market pricing. Like I said "The most, hold lor".
 
Regardless, your wife loves it, your kids love it, heck, even your dogs and cats love it and your overwhelming urge to get THIS and only this "ideal" property cos hell, even your fengshui master says you must.
So, you end up paying a premium for it.
 
That's the point I'm making, there are exceptions to every rule no matter how rare.
If you see my posts, I believe same as you that the property market is going to tank big time, but if you sway sway kena like this then, its kinda lan lan.
 
By the way, 300-400 psf for balestier.... most of my peers bought during the years 2007-2009, myself included, though I did pay slightly in excess of 500psf... It is not that uncommon unlike the way you make it sound.

You are missing my point completely. It needs to be read in context with my earlier post.
 
Let me illustrate,
 
I've got 2 properties, one in Binjai which I'm staying in and I like and another for example some mass market condo in some suburb for investment.
IF you wanna buy my "investment" property, I sure sell sell sell in light of the market downtrending. On the other hand, if you wanna buy my "own stay" property, let's say I price it at 25 million (cos maybe for 25 million I can finally realize my dream of owning the yacht of my dreams or whatever reason) and I am not going to drop this price regardless of the general property market pricing. Like I said "The most, hold lor".
 
Regardless, your wife loves it, your kids love it, heck, even your dogs and cats love it and your overwhelming urge to get THIS and only this "ideal" property cos hell, even your fengshui master says you must.
So, you end up paying a premium for it.
 
That's the point I'm making, there are exceptions to every rule no matter how rare.
If you see my posts, I believe same as you that the property market is going to tank big time, but if you sway sway kena like this then, its kinda lan lan.

You kinda have a problem with your kinda language cos you kinda said and I kinda quote "Unless you bought like me at 300~400 psf or even as low at 200+ psf for a lowly freehold condo at balestier." which to me kinda implies that you kinda bought at 300-400psf... 
 
Of course it could be just me that's easily confused. In fact, yes it should be just me...

Any property markets which went for a bullrun for the past 20 years is already due for a correction since last year , the over supply isn't met by the increase in gdp and increasing population won't really do anything but make life even more difficult for anyone to survive here. The current leadership is over simplistic in their views and they have yet to work from bottom up and lack business acumen and vision.
 
You want asset prices to grow , first you need gdp and economic growth , population grow comes after that not before , without it , we will fall into a deflation cycle similar to Japan or Taiwan.
 
Tell me what is the 20 year plan for the government? Who is next in line for the present leadership and who is being groomed to take over?
 
Non.
 
For Singapore to simply survive , we need to get more professionals to come here to "create" jobs , not fight for jobs from the local , this is a wrong approach to attract foreign talent.
 
We need our garmen to open up the economy via policy like letting SME the chance to fail and not be penalized for it. Banks or the garment should provide the platform in terms of financing and infrastructure for young entrepreneurs to create something for the future.
 
Rentals and financing policy for such young startups should be reviewed and you can place them far far from town via IT villages or something similar to places like sillicon valley in the west or even in places where population is still sparse. You can rent those places to young startups for peanut in view that in the future they will be the ones which will move us further up the value chain.
 
Why are prices the rental of hawker stalls pegged to the price of private stalls? Isn't the garmen greedy for money ? They cannot even let the hawkers make more? By letting hawkers make more it indirectly promotes job renewal and graduates would probably even consider those jobs as they potentially earn more than a blue collar job , it  promotes entrepreneurship and increases money flow.
 
Just look at how many business are being priced out simply due to the fact their rental simply off the charts. This kills SMEs and entrepreneurship , which in turn employs the less educated, a property downturn and a sharp decrease in rental cost might kill some but it is beneficial to us in the future. Right now , i believe , we will at least experience 5 years of slowdown and potentially more.
 
Right now the ones which knew this might happen has already sold their property last year and are sitting on cash , personally i do not think they will come back to invest at least for the next 3~5 years. For me , my view is unless prices are back at pre 2005 prices , i won't even consider. You are welcome to suss me all you want , i made a handsome sum and even if prices continue to go up and i was wrong it is fine. That money is just not my to earn.

I know this is a carforum but hei .. lower asset prices = lesser money for the property agents = lesser competitions for coe = lower car prices .
 
It is all good!!
 
The erp has proven that it doesn't work , you need to one shot humtam big one for instance one short 10 bucks per entry and 20 for super peak hours and taxis and buses enters free and goods vehicles pays double the price during peak hours(this force them to plan their delivery).
 
See whether got people wanna drive their car in or not. This in turn, creates alot of job opportunities for Singaporeans as taxi drivers and they will be lesser complaints.
 
Bad for the drivers but hei as compared to a 60~80k COE(indirect garment tax) plus 100% garment TAX on car prices, i am open to all options.

Agreed except for having taxis enter free.
 
If your main goal is to limit congestion, why should taxis be exempted? One person taking a taxi into the city during peak hours creates the same congestion as one person driving a car.

dude , taxi don't congest the roads if there is no demand and it is easier to control taxi population using regulation than private car owners, they pick and fk off , cars do all sort of funny things when they queue for carparks .
 
The over abundance in cars is typically the problem simply because people can afford the erp, if they jack it all up to 20 per pop see how many can tahan , they either wait for a latter time to take or simply just hop on a cab. Yes you might face an inital crunch in taxis but to me it is a good problem.

Read this letter from Today paper...
http://www.todayonline.com/voices/home-prices-unlikely-fall-due-high-demand
 

FROM WANG TOON TUAN


PUBLISHED: MAY 19, 4:14 AM

 
 

I refer to the report “Resale prices of non-landed private homes hit 16-month low” (May 13).
 
The expectation by one of the analysts, that the residential property price index would fall by 5 per cent to 10 per cent this year, appears to be an overestimation. Ultimately, a supply and demand imbalance will influence property prices and rentals.
 
The Urban Redevelopment Authority estimated the number of homes being completed will be 20,000 this year and 24,000 next year.
 
Despite this record number of homes flooding the market, the potential demand would outstrip supply and counter the effect of the cooling and loan curb measures. Four main areas of real demand will support both the resale and rental market.
 
First, new permanent residents and citizens are added annually to the population and they are able to absorb the influx of completed homes.
 
Second, the OCBC Investment Research showed that, when interest rates fell from 2.2 per cent in 2008 to 0.56 per cent in 2012, households earning S$8,700 a month could have afforded a S$1 million condominium. Only 10 per cent of these 447,000 households would match the supply of homes this year and next.
 
Third, there has been pent-up demand due to rapid population growth and undersupply from 2005 to 2010, which has been largely unfulfilled.
 
Fourth, there are many singles in the 30 to 39 age group, enough of whom are diploma and degree holders who can take up all the shoebox units, and then some, from the mass condominium market.
 
The other key driving factors are interest rates, affordability, rental yield, unemployment rate and liquidity. These are sound fundamentals, at least for the near future.
 
With a burgeoning demand, any further price fall this year is unlikely, as this would draw buyers back to the market.

 
Really a piece of crap analysis 
 
Household income of $8,700 can afford $1M condo??? Singles who're diploma & degree holders will likely to take up shoebox units???  
 
This chap must either be one who already brought his properties at a high price or he must be a property agent... he must be praying hard for the property price not to go down. He probably hope his letter will help to in his cause... well i guess most of us are not fool

by his reason,
in 2030 ... hdb resale is no $1M no talk for any tom, dick, harry unit ... although now limited at tiong bahru, redhill, bishan, toa payoh, etc
suburban private condo is no $2000psf no talk ... not far from current $1300psf

Problem is investors nowadays think they can buy using a loan means they have buying power.
 
In that analysis , it means how many % of debt is he going to service? Ask him back lor . 8.7 k buy 1 million , don't need to eat dun need to pay cpf also need damn long. He think he signing slavery contract ah? Why enrich the property developers and the garmen?
 
1,000,000/8700 = 115 months round off
 
9.6 years , less to say if it is just a % of your pay. Clearly this analyst don't know his books. If my boy , i shoot him until he like beehive.

Even without additional cooling measures, the fact that they are still in place already tells you what the government thinks of things.

i already said my views haha up to you to believe or not. Those on top aren't doing what they are paid. Property prices should never have risen so much and create such a bubble , foreign ownership should have come with a clause to limit the speculations and interest rates should not have being so low for so long.
 
They do not have an idea of how to settle their rising cost via their own wage inflation , inflation due to the rising cost of living via transport and housing, yet the marginal wages needed for survival for everyone else is dropping. Yes they still have the cheeks to tell u to expect less, yet slapping their own initial idea of keeping talents via "high" wages. Which is worse , a corrupt govern or a self declared "clean" garmen which doesn't open their books to temasek and cpf and sues a commoner for petty accusations.
 
He wanted to learn the ones before him but he doesn't have what it takes to deal the death blow to the one he sues yet he wants to try , seriously low classed act.
 
What happened to the "honest" mistake policy?

wah u seem to be very happy to see ppl lelong their condo ah!  
I not only like, I buy (no ... grab) during a lelong crisis. 
To me at least, the best time was in 1997, at the bottom if AFC.
D10 landed property and condo prices were falling like $100-200K a week!
 
Cash was king then! 
 
There were greedy and oso desperate owners clinging on to their high prices.
So I played tarik harga with agents ... they oso desperate for sale /commission.
 
Say a property advertised in Dec 1996 (after the Asian markets oredi tanked), a large D10 FH condo unit was asking for $2M. 
After about one quarter, asking price dropped to $1.7-1.8M. I offered $1.6M ... don't want, never mind, I wait.  Like pulling in marlin fish with hook, line and sinker.
 
By May 1997, asking dropped to $1.6M, agent called me and asked about my $1.6M offer - ai close mai? I told them that was then, but now, market has weaken further. Offered $1.5M, greedy owner didn't want. So never mind, I wait.
 
By July 1997, same agent called again and owner now in regretted submission, accepts $1.5M.
But I told them market even worse now, $1.4M. Take it or leave it.
 
Closed at $1.4M ... vs what the same owners could have gotten at $2M some 6 months ago.
 
Went through 2 similar situations back then, one owner lost his job, the other forex trader who had lost his pants with high loan exposure.
 
These properties are worth at least 5 times now, vs what I had paid for them during the AFC!
Hehehe

Going prices for central core districts very high.Typical $3000 psf - e.g. Grange Residences.
 
So an 'average' 3200 sqft unit will cost $9.6m liao!
 
Of course  I not saying astrid bought Grange Residences lah.
But just to put you in perspective that it does not have to be a >5000 sqft unit to fetch $7m in the prime district where Singapore elites live.

he was referring to which D10 condo bought at 1.4m could turn into 7m..
 
definitely not 3,000 sqft grange residences

I think easily, many typical D10 condos are in the $1800-2000psf range (there are of course, even more expensive ones).
 
So for $7m today, we're looking at a 3500 sqft unit - again, typical of what one can find in the older D10 estates like Tanglin Park, Regency Park etc.
Like they say: they don't build like them anymore.
Today's condos can squeeze 4 rooms in 1300 sqft - so ridiculous!
 
Anyway, he would have bought his $1.4m condo from a fire sale during the AFC.
Lots of fire sales going on then , and many people were bankrupt :(
 
So from $1.4m to $7m today, that's 5x lor.
 
I think many like him had made themselves very rich during and after the AFC.
Many had lost everything they'd had, but then, just as many had reaped the spoils of the property market then!
 
Personally, I know of a bunch of medical doctors/surgeon friends of mine having gone into the market to buy up a couple of 'distressed' houses each - during and after the AFC.
They are able to do that, since they are all cash rich!
 
I really envy them.
Now they are sitting on pots of gold, when they liquidate!

Oh just to add - I had also bought a D10 (original condition) semi-D during that same AFC time.
Bargained hard till way way less than $2m.
Tore down the house and rebuilt from scratch.
Now after 16 years, the house is worth $8m+, based on many recent secondary sales.
 
But time-value appreciation for landed (esp semi-Ds) won't be as mercurial as condos - and that's a fact.
Condo prices rise much more quickly, but fall just as quickly (only for prime district).
 
OCR, outskirts and especially 99 LH condos in outer areas are rather slow to lack-lusture, as they are not deemed to be as 'attractive' to the foreign investors.  These groups usually only seek out D9/10/11 condos mainly.

at the rate resale prime rents are falling now, i wont b surprised to see some prices breach levels down faster than expected. so many cannot fetch high rents anymore especially old units. finding buyers now is even harder!

Ming Teck park of course bad traffic, small roads and high density lah.  That area is not representative of D10 landed lah.  Don't waste your money to buy this area. There are much better neighbourhoods in D10 and not much more expensive. Just top up lor since you so much cash. For example inside the Greenleaf or Old Holland Rd area. Mt Sinai also can. Much better than Ming Teck and not costing a lot more. 
Your daughters need to go MGS? Or SCGS? You can try nearer those schools, like Swiss Club, Binjai area or lower down in the Merryn Rd, Swiss cottage area...

i also can tell you market is soft. no need private banker haha ... 
my opinion - if they remove the CMs too soon, all the kan cheong spiders will rush to buy (just like if COE tmr drop to $10-20k, sure got people rush to buy car). i believe CMs will remain in play for a lot longer, but thats just my opinion ...

my opinion - if they remove the CMs too soon, all the kan cheong spiders will rush to buy (just like if COE tmr drop to $10-20k, sure got people rush to buy car). i believe CMs will remain in play for a lot longer, but thats just my opinion ...

 
they shld intro a CM rebate, that means u can buy now n ABSD, but later when sell theyll rebate back ABSD LOL. That way they slow the mkt but wont crash it coz pple will still buy knowing theyll get it back later? ok im rambling

If you know this country, you will know that the CM will stick around at least a few years beyond GE.
 
Maybe i am wrong then i dont know this country anymore.
 
Also the key is to moderate the market movement not to cause a big swing.  But being far from market and relying purely on empirical data causes one to lose the feel which sometimes is truly the most important thing.
 
I'm sitting tight.....

Feelings influences price which influences feelings which influences price......etc....
 
If prices fall long and hard enough, panic will come.

Ming Teck park of course bad traffic, small roads and high density lah. That area is not representative of D10 landed lah. Don't waste your money to buy this area. There are much better neighbourhoods in D10 and not much more expensive. Just top up lor since you so much cash. For example inside the Greenleaf or Old Holland Rd area. Mt Sinai also can. Much better than Ming Teck and not costing a lot more.
 
Your daughters need to go MGS? Or SCGS? You can try nearer those schools, like Swiss Club, Binjai area or lower down in the Merryn Rd, Swiss cottage area...

 
Go MGS can buy D21... deeper parts of Binjai also in D21... cheaper also...

these projects are mainly the D9,10,11
 
which have been limping ever since GFC
 
Even with whatever price cuts, it will still be out of range for the mass market (which is the real demand in SG property) so mass market continue to throng launches like coco palm, snapping up 500 units in a day at a ridiculously low 25% discounted price of $1,100 psf

Great mislead there!
Making it sound like its 500units every day.
After the 500 mostly smaller units sold, how much unsold? Another 40% left?
Cool. 
 
Small units used to go for $1300 to $1500psf in heartlands and easily $2500psf in the prime areas.

wah why u keep calling me out? pang chance lah dai kor  
 
i assume everyone is aware that it's not 500 units every project lah. 
 
In march, whole of SG only sold 480 units
In Apr, it was 745 units
Now in May, coco palm alone sold 500 units in one day 
 
BTW the other 40% of coco palm not sold because wasn't released.. i think developers cannot handle so many paperwork at one go

Discussion, exchange opinions mah.....
 
Anyway, sold 500 Mickeymouse a day is nothing.
If can sell 50 prime top class condos a day then is something.
 
Ok continue to monitor.
 
Take it easy.
 
Huat ah!

Any real demand for mickey mouse units would be merely because the perceived "lower" prices but anyone which studied how assets cycles move would know,  if what is sold for the prices of last year is still lower than the prices of this year then something is wrong?
 
Why pay this kind of price ? Anyway this is just my opinion, anything above 700 for pasir ris is not realistic but pure greed from developers and garmen alike.

oh yeah, taking it easy haha
 
selling 500 mm in a day is not easy hor. you know how many hundreds of agents have to send thousands of mailers and stand in the hot sun for hours to get enough people in to buy?
 
on a side note since you mentioned about prime property (your favourite), despite all the hoo ha about high end market dying, developers are still unwilling to let go at steep discounts. There were proposals to bulk purchase entire development at 30% discount but the developer also not biting despite having launched the project years ago and have low sale rate
 
whereas some funds would probably be willing to take the 30% if they have to recycle the capital back to the west. 

Any real demand for mickey mouse units would be merely because the perceived "lower" prices but anyone which studied how assets cycles move would know, if what is sold for the prices of last year is still lower than the prices of this year then something is wrong?

You should know that the highest in the food chain is the state who owns all the land.
 
Developers margin have remained the same whether in 2003 or 2013, maybe now even more compressed, idk
 
agents also earning abt the same, commission rates now higher but negated by the lower volume
 
So who is clearing all the money off the table? Whose pure greed?
 
People like to focus on the developer, but they forget developers are firms whose objective is to maximize profit
 
Government's objective is to take care of the people but...

Not released?
 
I was told... all units not released in one of the new launch. But, pick your choice unit and they will release on demand. 
 
So, they can show big big in news paper... 100% SOLD on phase I.
