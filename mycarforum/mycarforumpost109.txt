URA proposes rezoning of parts of Geylang
 
 
SINGAPORE: The Urban Redevelopment Authority on Tuesday (Jan 13) announced it is proposing to rezone parts of Geylang, so as to better manage the area in question and "prevent spillover of disamenities to surrounding areas".
 
URA said the proposed area is bounded by Geylang Road, Lorong 22 Geylang, Guillemard Road and Lorong 4 Geylang, excluding the parcels of land zoned Road, the lots fronting Geylang Road and the sports field bounded by Talma Road and Lorong 12 Geylang. It plans to rezone this area from Residential/Institution to Commercial/Institution, according to its press release.
 
 
 
Explaining the decision, URA Chief Planner Hwang Yu-Ning said in the proposal that Geylang is a "rich and colourful neighbourhood" interspersed with associations, clans, places of worship, shops, offices and residential uses. It is also a traditional red-light area, she noted.
 
"The various entertainment and eating outlets in the area give rise to activities of a certain colour and vibrancy," Ms Hwang said. "With more new residential developments in the area, there has been an increasing spillover of disamenities and friction on the ground.
 
"In our assessment, the growth of new residential community in the area of Lorongs 4-22 Geylang needs to be re-balanced and moderated."
 
She added the new residential developments in the area, which have been approved will not be affected and can proceed to be built.
 
The URA said members of public can submit their feedback, objection or representation to the proposal in writing to the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of National Development, 5 Maxwell Road, Singapore 069110, by Feb 11, 2015.
 
More information on this proposal can be found on the URA website.

How is rezoning going to "prevent spillover of disamenities to surrounding areas" when there are already so many residential lots in the area?
 
Next time no more chicken house, will be chicken showroom or chicken office. Maybe chicken building, Chicken Shopping Centre.

it will get a few generations to get rid of geylang's image.
 
iirc, some banks don't want to even do geylang property loan.

Looks like Red light district is going to become smaller liao ...
 
Also good: reduces the bad image of geylang, as well as getting rid of the secret societies and pimps there.

Note, what we have there are entertainment and eating outlets.
 
I also believe the use of the words "colour" and "vibrancy" is more than coincidental.

Haha, my toes are laughing.
 
Rezoning?
 
Rezone one lorong to another lorong?
 
Muayhahahahahahahah, please please use your head.  The one on the neck, that is.
 
Shifting the action here and there isnt gonna do much.  And if you uproot the whole of geylang, another district elsewhere would be impacted.  
 
spillovers?  Yes, it will always.  Whadaya expect?  
 
Geylang is good for what it is, accept it.  Live with it.   Anyway, why do i care?  Demolish the whole lot!  Wahahaha

Simi is disamenities?
 
Sounds like the people there are underhappy with their situation, due to frequent ponding in Singapore, so, amenities become disamenities and can spill over liao, whatever the heck the above sentence means. (I have totally no idea, which qualifies me for dispolitics.)
 
=D
 
Cheers

I support the rezoning.
Frustrated residents are the biggest source of complaints. By disallowing future resi developments, future frustration is avoided. Hopefully will become something like Kampong Glam.
 
Shd make the area more vibrant by closing off some Lor to be purely for pedestrian use.
 
Accept the reality that Geylang will always
be famous for what it already is.

Ok...rezoning is good...but how come they didn't say what will happen to the red light district?
 
Are they going to relocate the red light areas or what?
 
I mean there is a certain reason why geylang was a red light district in the first place, so are they going to abandon that containment strategy?

The land in Geylang is mostly freehold properties(for private condos). So it's not about who wants to stay there. Ppl just want to buy the properties and keep also nevermind coz not much freehold property left on sunny Singapore. Sure huat one. Now gahment doing something. Ka Ching for those who own properties there.

Those geylang drivers are the most dangerous.
 
I was crossing the road and the driver never even see me
 
and almost knock me down.
 
He was looking to the left and looking to the right
 
but never look at the road in front.

Um. Disamentities is a real word/term.... In this case, it seems to be used correctly as well (not like when they used ponding)..

If the red-light-district is still there, i don't think property there will sell. Wonder where they'll relocated the district.
