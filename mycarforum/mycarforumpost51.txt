I am looking to sell my house on my own. Its a private property.
Â 
However I do no know where to begin.
For starters, I just found out that I can't list my house on propertyguru if I am not an agent.
Â 
Can anyone give me some advise or point me to a place where I can find out more?
Â 
many thanks

place an ad in the newspaper (classifieds) under property for sale. if you die die don't want to work with agents, put "no agents please"
Â 
(I would advise against this though, in my experience, 99% of my deals are because of introductions to buyers via agents - just factor in the 1% cost lah)
Â 
i suppose if you are looking for an online portal, you can try 
Â 
edit: hmmm the link was removed. go to 99.co

Â 

Â 
in the last 6 years, i have advertised a few hundred times in the newspaper ... never had a direct buyer come through (even for small properties). always agents calling and then they swing their clients by. 
Â 
good thing about having an agent in between means more wiggle room for negotiation. by the time the buyer convey the message to the agent who will convey to me, i have time to strategize ;)
Â 
but to each his own of course ... i am just an employee so my stake is not that much 
Â 
just giving my $0.02 on why the agents are more useful than it seems.
Â 
recently was trying to buy 1 commercial property and the guy was insisting on no agents. his ad said very clearly. more than 1 year later, he couldnt sell and now i started to see agents advertise. selling direct is not so easy. sorry to say, you need someone 'slick' in between to convince both parties to come to agreement. agents know the seller is buttering their bread, so they have to try their best to make it work

yes yes please give agent a chance  
Â 
another way is to find an agent friend or relative (almost everyone knows at least 1 agent right?? LOL)
Â 
ask him or her to help u advertise for free lah
Â 
i have helped some friends to advertise for free cos i cannot finish up the credits. But of course they would have to do all the leg work, paper work etc by themselves

Sold my HDB flat myself some years back and it was quite easy and straightforward. In fact, at the time the HDB even arranged weekend seminars to advise people who wished to do the process themselves. 
Â 
My advice.
Â 
1) If you do not like nuisance / speculative calls then do not use your regular phone number. Buy a pre-paid SIM for the duration of the transaction and then cancel it.
Â 
2) Do not rule out agents, just let them know you will pay them the usual co-broke commission if they bring you a successful buyer,  ie, 0.5%. This will give you access to a much wider pool of buyers as there are plenty of people that are too lazy to do their own research but just sit and wait to look at whatever their agent shows them. Of course if you find a buyer that responds direct then you can still avoid paying any commission..

For me it has always been 0.5%
Â 
I hv sold several on my own.
Â 
Be sharp be decisive
Dont be emotional personal nor sentimental
Â 
Of course i pick the best time to sell 
ie when everyone wants to buy.
Â 
Now just be ready to cut your price to push out the property.
Â 
Reality bites

Word of mouth.
Whoever brings me a buyer that deals, i pay 0.5%.
In other words, i do the pitch myself.
Buyer gets to talk directly and nego directly with me the owner/seller.
No bulls**t no fuss, no beating around the bush
Price is very reasonable and at market, no shadowing.
True Genuine buyers like that.

Â 
Most difficult thing to sell by your self is probably to get buyer. 
Â 
Some way of getting buyer is via Advertising 
-Property website like Guru or STproperty or Clickproperty or Propertyfactsheet
-Classified like Gumtree etc.. 
Â 
Or what Throttle2 mentioned, via Forum if they allowed you to do so...

Few years back when property is hot, it was easy to do own sale/rent as there were many ready buyers/tenants on the market. Managed to do this on my own then.
Â 
Recent years have proven to be difficult. Now prefer to use agent as they've a better network. But do get a reliable and honest agent who will look after your interest.

With the current down in resale pricing and property demand in the local market, it is harder to sell on your own. However if you wish to you may advertise on the newspaper which cost around $50 +- for a 4 liner ad

hope this can go through.
This site does not have many ads, don't think will spur much interest.
