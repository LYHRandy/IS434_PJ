I think the area is gazetted as a Good Class Bungalow Area (GCBA), so there could be restrictions on what could be developed there. That's my guess

if carved out, then will be no different to other plots. The attraction is the SIZE. And yes, bro Altivo said it right, GCB land carve out liao can only build landed, can't develop much

the size land is only good for like 4-5 typical GCB.

they already mentioned that the 300mil is already 50% above mkt value.
 

seems like he's banking on some MEGA carrot heads to drop by before mkt downturn.

GCB can only sell to Singaporeans right? Maybe the newly minted citizens (ex-PRCs / indians) might be interested.

Don't think he can get his asking price. Market price for Nassim GCBs is about $2000 psf so his house should be valued at around $170m.
 

Furthermore, only Singapore citizens can purchase large GCBs, so the number of eligible buyers is extremely small. And will they be willing to pay such a hefty premium?

Anybody watched the news on channel 5 whereby they interviewed some "property experts"? Apparently they said the house is targeted at " top 5 percent  of singaporeans buyers". I almost fell off my chair. 
 

That means 1 in 20 singaporeans can afford a 300 million dollar house? Where did they get the figure from? Tikam tikam pull out a figure?  They are more like goons than experts to make a statement like that.

Lol that's what I say statistic pulled out of thin air. And a unbelievable one too.(which you did.) How do you define high income earners? Which strata is that? 
 

The ministers pay are peg to the top 0.05% of the workforce. I would be hard pressed to think they can even smell a 300 million house with their exorbitant salaries.
 

Bear in mind that only singaporean can buy landed here. The bs of top 5% of "high income "(whoever they may be) can easily afford 300 million house? More like top 0.005% of "high income earners" that is remotely plausible.

At current conversion rate, SGD $300m roughly equates to USD $243m
 

http://www.forbes.com/sites/morganbrennan/...s-in-the-world/

In that slideshow of 20 slides, USD$243 should make it to the top 5.
 

If the S$300m deal materialise,  hope the new owner will not chop it into 3 , 4 or (gasp) even 5 pieces for redevelopment. 

That would a very cheapo move.
 

I do wonder why the 20 slides did not include hk tycoons. Their land will be more expensive.
