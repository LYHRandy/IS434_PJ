I'm been looking at this project and considering buying one unit  aiming for the bigger or biggest unit there.  Still got some unsold ones.
 
Any advice on this? 
 
I know I no money, can't afford a real private condo.      Anyway, if i want to really buy this, it will be an appeal case for me.  I got some things that exceeds the requirements.   
 
Never knew that EC is so troublesome...... 
 
I need to know the peak traffic condition from Pungool to Town.  there are 3 routes, as far as i know: TPE to ECP, TPE to KPE and TPE to CTE
 
How's the travelling experience of taking MRT during peak hour?
 
I heard that there are plane noise over Sengkang and Punggol.  Will this project be affected by this noise too?

Peak hour traffic is very bad as there are only 2 exits out of Punggol now. If you are taking the train, this project is quite far away, about 10-15mins walk.
 
One new semi expressway will be built in the near future, while the planes will stop once they moved Paya Lebar airbase out. These would be at least 10years later

When is EC going to TOP ? By the time it has TOP, the traffic situation may not be the same as now leh.
 
Anyway for now:
MRT - morning travel sure can get into the train, but 50/50 chance to get a seat. Evening time also can get into the train, but no seat at all, unless you take from Harbourfront.
 
Plane noise will affect this EC as it is still in the Punggol area. However this is only temporary cos air base will move to Changi after a few years time.

There are a few ECs there you can consider in that area:
Lush Acres
Ecopolitan
Waterwoods
Waterbay (probably sold out)
 
From the recent land tender by government you can expect 2 more ECs coming up in Anchorvale Crescent.
 
IMO you should wait for the 2 ECs to launch before making a decision since based on the tender price the old ECs there and new ECs are going to be about the same price - Might as well go in as a fresh buyer with many choices to choose from.
 
Ecopolitan has a less better location than Lush Acres and the upcoming 2 ECs by Qingjian and SInghaiyi Group. Beside expressway may mean noisy. Lush Acres next to upcoming mall. The 2 new ECs launching soon is also very near to compass point with many more amenities. All these above mentioned ECs are very near to each other.
 
Anyway don't wanna be a wet blanket but appeal cases for EC seldom go through so best of luck!

To me, Lush Arcs and any project that is not direct walking distance to MRT is a no no.  To think that someone needs to take LRT to MRT is not a good selling point.  
 
Imagine, the little LRT train, which can take in limited capacity each time.  And you got residents from nearby few projects + HDB residents, all squeeze on that small LRT station and waiting to take LRT during peak hours.......   
 
I rather choose to stay somewhere that is near to MRT, walking distance and i don't have to wait for LRT.  MRT already so squeeze, and i have to squeeze again in LRT??? 
 
Heard the Punggol has some major development going on, with 4-5 malls and other interesting stuff around Punggol MRT. 
 
 
Yeah, i know appeal is hard to approve.  But if developer is desperate to dispose those units, they will work harder to get it approved....  [sly]I don't lose anything if appeal doesn't go through.....

LRT - around 2015 or so they are going to have two carriage LRT, so that should ease some of the congestion on the LRT train - at the moment during morning and evening rush hour is very very bad. 
 
Traffic - Unless they improve, sure to die, already got trouble some mornings getting onto TPE - once all the units launch the it will be terrible. 
 
The plane noise not a problem - they don't fly late into the night, and it is relatively rare anyway.  When they flying it is annoying, but is for short time and not that often. 
 
I would not be buying right now - I'd be waiting for the market to fall. 
 
Also do note - "close to MRT", if that is your criteria is good, but in this case close to MRT means far from waterway - and, to me, "close to waterway" is of more value than "close to MRT" 
 
Do also pay attention to the glut of EC that is around, and that, given the new rules that were announced as regards size - come time to privatise and sell there may well be an over supply so the value might not be what is expected. 
 
We looked at buying EC - and decided against it.  The main reason was that to swap on a "size for size" basis, we were looking at around $1 mill for the EC - it didn't quite stack up financially to pay that to live in what is still HDB.  Rather obviously, others will have different priorities. We felt it was better to stick to our "low class" HDB (with an equally low class mortgage) and save the excess money to buy a rental condo instead.

agree with your pointers.  I'm concerned with the traffic conditions.  I hope LTA will look into expanding the entrance and exit soon.  
 
EC is meant for stay in for long term.  not meant for flipping and capital appreciation. Of coz, EC will still appreciate, but at a lower rate than private condo (as proven by older ECs that are for sale today)
 
I'm looking at EC due to living conditions, number of rooms per unit.  its meant for young families with elders living together. To pay 1 million and u get 5-6 rooms in a unit, i think its worth.
 
 
As spoken to a condo agent recently, the TDSR is a killer when u want to buy a private condo, unless strike 1st prize TOTO.  The cash layout is

If you're looking at dual key (or given my family, it would be duel key) units, do pay attention to the size - they somehow squeeze three toilets etc into what seems to me to be a very small space - I would be very careful here to see if you can exact room size measurements - ESPECIALLY for the living room. 
 
Draw it out on the floor, or see if you can get a feel for how big it is. You might get a surprise at how cramped it is going to be.  (not that there are a lot of options out there)

nah, i'm not going for DK units. the design looks stupid and senseless to me.........  
 
If i'm buying, i will get the real 4-5 bedroom unit with larger unit size.  I like Eco coz they have cospace concept.  will be useful for some room redesign.

This may well be a smart move - if you can get a genuine four room unit - does the EcoPolitian fall under the size restriction, or was it launched prior to that?  If it does not fall under the size restriction, and you can get one of the "big" units - the size will probably be a big attraction in the market 10 years later as it will (most likely) be rarer.  
 
Sorry if I am being condescending - but do pay attention to the "void space" if they have it in the design, and do pay particular attention to any areas that you are not allowed to "close in" - these have both been issues in PSF and total floor calculations in other units. 
 
Just to let you know also, in Punggol there are some executive flat designs available in Punggol - these are 130 sqm - with three bedrooms plus what they call as a study.  (but are still HDB apartment rather than EC) 
 
We have some in the block opposite us. 
 
Just to throw something else at you - given the size you are looking at, is it at all possible to be looking at two adjacent 4 room units in another estate?  Buy one in your name, and one in parents?

There are only 3 roads (Sengkang East, Punggol Rd, Punggol East) going in and out of Punggol and its shared with residents from Sengkang. So during peak hours, its either you get out early or prepare to get caught in a queue to get out or into the estate. Its going to be much worse when the new HDB are ready by end of the year and more are mushrooming. I think residents of Ecopolitan will have traffic jam up to their doors when its ready. That exit is one of the worst.
 
MRT on peak hours? Always full. People from Sengkang or Buangkok will ride up to have a seat. Even if you board in Punggol, there is no guarantee that you will have a seat.
 
Noise is the least issue for residents in Punggol. They do 3 shortie with 3 to 5 planes. Will fly in between 7 to 8pm and thats it. Its a little annoying but just give them a few seconds and they will bugger off.

The biggest they have is over 1500 sqft, 5 + 1 study cospace + 1 utility bedroom unit.  Forestville EC in woodlands has 5 bedroom unit that offers over 2100 sqft. price is slightly higher than Eco.  But Woodlands is way too far off, comparing to Punggol.
 
If i'm going to stay in a ulu place like punggol, my motto is to get the biggest unit so that it offers some comfort over the inconvenience.  But hey, i realise punggol has some big master plan for development.  It's becoming a more self-contain estate than before.

Yes, they be building a hawker centre, a polyclinic, a SAFRA clubhouse in the area. If you don't want to drive out, stay in the estate is good enough!

I believe Punggol can not be classified as a ulu place already. considering the huge amount of masterplan in place for it.
 
travelling to town is way much faster than woodlands.. but a headache if you frequent west area like jurong.

contributing to what I know firsthand (my experiences may differ from others) :
 
1. Training sorties usually take place in early afternoon 2/3ish or early evening 6/7ish. Every training last about average 20 mins or so? It is not a daily training schedule. Heck, I dunce recall hearing the jets for days sometimes.
 
2. Journey between Punggol MRT to Dhoby Ghaut MRT by train is about 22-23 mins (not including LRT transit to Punggol MRT station). If train breaks down, all bets are off!
 
3. By car from Punggol to Bugis through Upper Serangoon/Bendemeer/Jalan Besar/Bencoolen during 7.30am to 8.00am peak hour. Half hour journey.
 
4. By car from Punggol to Nicoll Highway via KPE. 20 to 25 mins. Sometimes 35 to 40 mins cos the traffic can get crazy in the.morning.

Got good and bad lah.....5 years ago less crowded but then facilities not complete.....
 
10 years ago even less crowded, but lack of many facilities. There's no MRT, no LRT, no Punggol Plaza, no CC, no waterway and very few supermarket. That time only bus 83 and 136 comes into Punggol. Now we have them and more public buses, much more convenient now, especially for those who don't have a car.

let me answer your question,
for eco - exit at the less congested exit(not so bad)
to town, take KPE unless very massive jam (CTE more ex and similar results)
 
How's the travelling experience of taking MRT during peak hour? -can go in but might not have seats (7 am still have seats)
