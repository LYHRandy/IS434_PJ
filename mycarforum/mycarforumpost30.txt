As a single man (below age 35) in Singapore, basically i cannot do anything with local property. Not rich enough for Condo XD
 
 I am hoping to get a decent HDB once I get married later, so as to get some government grants... Hence I am wondering are there brothers here who have participated in overseas property purchases?
 
I have went through the numerous adverts in Straits Times of property purchases in overseas in countries as diverse as Australia, UK, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia etc.. (I wonder why not much of USA property), and is a little skeptical. Someone wrote to the Straits Times forum last week mentioning how many of these property companies tend to "collapse" with many investors burnt with money owed to banks, or even better, the land in mind does not even get developed at all...
 
Are there proper ways to look for properties to buy in overseas market? I am actually thinking of Cambodia, then again..... I do not mind learning and doing research, but with so much scams and "big canon fairies" around, hard to know which knowledge is decent.... Any bros or sisters here with advice or experience to share? =D
 
I was thinking of Capitaland's  The Ascott Limited - Somerset Norodom in Phnom Penh Price start from $1xxk which is cheap but i wonder how reliable is the rental guarantee they are offering though. Anyone has experience ? Location any good? 
 
From http://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/ascott-to-manage-1st-international-serviced-residence-in-cambodia
 
According to the news "Somerset Norodom Phnom Penh is part of a 28-storey mixed-use development located in an exclusive district surrounded by Norodom and Monivong boulevards. Embassies, foreign banks, multinational corporations and government agencies are within the vicinity, along with many F&B outlets. The property offers a range of studio to two-bedroom apartments, with facilities including a playroom, gymnasium, sauna and residents’ lounge."

first, ascott is an owner-operator. If the deal is so fantastic at 40% over 5 yrs from rental alone, why didnt ascott buy the property instead of just being an operator. obviously ascott themselves are not sure of the market in cambodia yet
 
second, the 40% "rental guarantee" simply means the developer mark up the price by 40% first then sell u with the 40% discount
 
next opportunity u see will be 50% and 60%, all the same trick one

Mayb ascott didnt have enough capitals to acquire properties. How many ascotts in this world are owned by them? After all they are franchiser  
 
In jakarta, Ascott property owned partially by ciputra group and in surabaya ascott property owned by pakuwon group. 
 
 
I think it depends. Countries like phnom penh are opening up their door with new cbd shaping up, its a potential to earn alot despite its high risk.

Yes cambodia laws and regulation are not english written. Its safer bet to invest in malaysia like KL or australia if market condition allows

It's easier to earn a franchise and management fee then to cough up big sums. The hotel chains usually adopt the franchise model and own select flagship properties. Risks are better managed that way.

It is still best to invest in something that you are familiar with, moreover it is for such a big-ticket item purchase.

But something familiar with also familiar with others.  
 
So familiar becomes not cheap
 
 
Familiar ends up out of reach and too expensive
 
 
Don't be like familiar as one can go research on familiar

Property ownership overseas is much more complex. You will need the advice and coordination of a local agent.
 
High risk, high gain, but also higher chance of loss.
 
Although they are not as closely protected by our local laws, renowned companies are not likely to jeopardise their reputation for these international projects.
 
Rental guarantee is kind of complex, you might have to find out the actual rates and actual incomes of the people working there to ascertain if the guaranteed rates are sustainable.
 
Many emerging economies are going through the early stage of Singapore in the 60s or 70s. Some might make it, some might be stalled. If you identify the right one and take the appropriate risk, it is possible to earn. 
 
But I think Sg Blue chips safer.

Guys, I recently spotted a good overseas property investment opportunity,  I am surprise not many people talk about it.  No it is not Cambodia, Vietnam or Malaysia but a 1st world country right at the city area  and yet some 3rd world prices! IMO, it is way undervalued for this city and I can't believe the prices when I saw it. (BTW, 999 years tenure development in this 1st world city)
 
I am considering of getting into this myself for investment because housing supply in this city is very limited and tenancy is not a problem.
 
Those who read my post know I don't talk crap, but I don't want people to think I am doing some "sales" here, so if you are keen looking at overseas, just PM me for more info.

Cambodia as a whole, nope. Looking at Phnom Penh only, yes. I myself bought one recently, I don't trust it at first thinking those jokers must be making me buy those ulu ulu place and looks like anytime will riot those country. That's until I look at the site visit photos my agent sent me. They have Toastbox, Breadtalk, Starbucks (only 1-2 branch now), bySI, Apple, Nike and so many more things happening at there. Same as the Vietnam one that I missed don't know what Verde. But anyway I bought a retail shop with guaranteed rental return for 10 years by a Singapore developer with less than SGD100k. That amount equals my BSD only    .
 
No need manage, mortgage mostly covered by rental and most importantly my shop might house pierre cardin or even Toastbox lol   . Dont know whether theres any left hor, go see yourself here

Hi would anyone like to buy a unit #13A-41, the Bridge (SOHO Tower) located at Phom Penh City, Kingdom of Cambodia? The transacted price is USD 114,982.00. There is a 20% deposit amount of USD 22,997.00
 

Here are the details of the Bridge: private area of 32.80 square meter, 14.47 square meter of common area, and 47.26 square meter for total area. There is a 6% guaranteed return of USD 6898.92 per year, payable quarterly. The other offices are already sold out.
 

Here is more information about the Bridge (SOHO) if you are interested. http://www.singaporepropertyforsale....SAAEgLrA_D_BwE
 

If you are interested in buying this unit, please feel free to contact me at 83817502.
6% return in a risky market like Cambodia you dare to advertise here? I don't consider this a decent yield in a 3rd world country.

Hi there, I found your question about overseas properties. I know it maybe bit late, but I would like to mention that there many other locations nearer to Singapore that you ought to think about. When I was surfing the internet for the best real estate investment destinations around the world, I found a website called Weetas mentioning that Bahrain, a small kingdom in the Middle East, is the next Dubai. Prices are still soft there and it has very positive prospects. 
 
It is a small and peaceful island near Saudi Arabia and it has many open freehold areas where all nationalities can purchase any type of property. Please make a thorough research before making any decision. Thanks,

There are good investment in Cambodia, within Phnom Penh City or outside of it. 
 
Most important are these are mostly freehold units and Cambodia is only starting to open up which means it has great potential to grow. There is no buyer's stamp duty or other foreigners' taxes in Cambodia.
 
The units will also be rented out for you and you get the full rental amounts with no extra agent fees.
 
If interested, pls pm.

Put money in Cambodia won't get money back. No resale demand in such places, need to wait for the entire place to be developed before there can be a vibrant secondary market.

You are talking about flipping a new project,  that is a different matter. You can pass on an off the plan unit that has been sold out from one unwitting buyer to another (probably a foreigner) through an agent. Try selling the built unit to another buyer in the secondary market n you will understand.

But why such a pessimistic view of the secondary market?
 
Things will improve as more houses are launched. 
 
In fact, most of the launches you see at Cambodia are consider the first few launches. Their potential for growth is tremendous.
 
With more and more online ads, propeety portal and printing services, the market for resale can only improve in the future.

Not condemning Cambodia,  but we are looking at at least 10 years before the place will see its potential. During the development phase,  nobody would be buying a resale unless the location is superb. Most of the time,  you buy with your sights on future potential,  but by the time that future potential comes,  your condo will be very old and may not be what buyers want as they will then be looking for new. That is why for overseas,  I always buy only built condos that can let me see immediate rental income,  otherwise don't tell me something that is only ready 5 years later.

Oxleyâs the Peak TOP already?  Choice location, Sg developer...The peak is selling at usd157k with 12% rental guarantee for 2 years. Guess what?  The rental guarantee is already priced into the buying price coz usd157k you can buy in more developed areas like Bangkok,  no need to buy Cambodia.
