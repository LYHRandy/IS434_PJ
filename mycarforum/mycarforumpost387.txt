I wonder how much a $1.2 mil HDB would worth when it reaches 90 years old. Those who bought it at high price had probably hoped that they will not the one holding the ball when the music stops.

Divorce to marry younger spouse will have benefits.
I think you got it wrong, it say the lease must be able to cover the younger spouse till age 95 if want to use maximum CPF to purchase. Meaning the younger spouse is 30 years old, the remaining lease of the resale flat you want to buy is 60 years, the CPF usage will be pro-rated and worse of all, when you reach 55, the amount of CPF you can withdraw above the basic retirement sum will be reduce.

how come benefit old flat ? 
 
 
The CPF part easy to understand . 
Property lease now needs to cover S’poreans until 95 for CPF withdrawal above Basic Retirement Sum
 
 
https://mothership.sg/2019/05/property-lease-withdraw-cpf-95/?fbclid=IwAR04df16OTjQPdO0Igk2zZF69AYWompAyK_PY4B8TGZvA23JK9gYIejaY_A
 
 
 
The CPF loan part : 
 
https://mothership.sg/2019/05/hdb-housing-loan-95-years/?fbclid=IwAR3PraKT3L_rJMkf8UuAuqEmW6dGvcFdJHHgLYIIGvR-A8FVhMNMXeA6bXQ
 
 
How it will work
 
But with the new rules, the criteria has changed.
 
The updated HDB loan rules now focus on lease coverage for the buyer.
 
The flat being bought needs to cover the age of the youngest buyer until the age of 95.
 
Let’s say the buyer is 40 years old, then the flat needs to have a lease of 55 years.
 
But if the buyer is purchasing the flat together with a 30-year-old partner, then the lease on the flat needs to have 65 years left.
 
Once this criteria is met, the HDB loan of up to a LTV limit of 90 percent will be extended.
 
A buyer can still get a HDB loan if he or she doesn’t meet the age requirement, although it will be pro-rated from 90 percent.
 
But if the property has a lease of 20 years remaining or less, then you don’t get a loan at all.

I suppose it will prevent some people from using up all their CPF to buy an expensive but old HDB. He might be forced to move out of the HDB when the lease is up, and got no CPF left. Homeless, and penniless. Double whammy.

i kind of see it the other way . 
 
First , they restrict you drawing off ur CPF at 55 even U have alot of money in it . So if U no property or HDB to cover u till 95, they will lock in the MS. 
 
The CPF loan . now Age+lease >=95.  In other word , old couple say 50 wan to downgrade , u must buy flat with >45 lease. 
 
If you buy say 30 yr lease flat ( ie 50+30 =80 ...) , you can use pro rate CPF amt only  + since u cant cover up to 95 , your CPF still kana lock in MS . basically stopping U to withdraw the excess out at 55 . 
 
What i see , this will restrict buyers to older flat ........ 
 
your suggestion is also possible , some crazy people will pay alot for a old flat . But I think not many will do that . In the past , some did that . Eg. Old parent sold their flat very high to their son . Old parent got alot of money in CPF or profit . They draw out and give to son etc ...

In your example, if downgrade, assuming new smaller flat you are buying is cheaper than the flat you are selling, you should have more CPF than is required to buy ? It seems they only limit how much CPF you can use to buy flat < 45 lease, not say you cannot buy if it doesn't use up your CPF ?
 
Parent sell to son at above market rate to withdraw son's CPF ... this loophole ..  [laugh] Shh ..

dome buys older flat because they wanted to wait for en-bloc as this flats are usually in old, matured and highly sought after neighbourhood. But with the 99 yrs lease saga these older blocks have lost it shines thus the gov needs yo do something about it. But then again, not many would want to buy this old flats......they have become a liability since the lease have become shorter.

Im just thinking out loud ... hahaha  
 
The concern is not the buying but the selling ... Say by the time U downgrade ur flat left 40 yr lease. Who will buy ? 
maybe those over 55 will buy .  Those in their 40s will buy flat with 55 - 50 yr lease flat , they wont buy ur 40 yr lease flat. 
At the end , old flat hard to sell. 
 
Those bought old flat , instead of  new flat , will likely to kana from this change. e.g. those sell off their new BTO to get older flat .. Say those who bought 60 yr-lease-left flat in their 30s ... 10 / 20 yrs later , they will have difficulty in selling off. Limited buyer .   
 
Any couple better to buy 70 yr lease min i think .  once the lease period drop to 50 or less , hard to sell. 
Another problem is , at 70 yr lease  u likely pay more for it ......... 20 yr later , value will drop alot and only those in the 45s will buy your flat .  end up buyer will cut price .  So Flat now become depreciation asset  ? hahaha  
 
I think the last batch of flat any one will buy maybe those 41 yr lease left  with buyers at 54 yrs old.  AFter that , even lesser buyer.

Behind all the 95 years confusion is this basic idea:
 
Previously can loan and use CPF up to the time the property is 30 years old.
 
Now can still loan and use CPF until the property is 20 years old.
 
Restrict here restrict there the main financing difference is this point only. The rest of the issues, the agents will sort it out to filter in the right buyers.

Can, but unlike the past, you cannot use 100% cpf since the age + lease left is not equal to 95.
 
Basically, with this new ruling, they encourage young buyers to buy newer flats and old people to buy old flats.
 
Which means the old flats will lose some demand from younger crowd.

I don't mean buying but if someone continue to live in a flat at 55yo with the lease add up left than 95 than he/she withdraw the cpf? 
if cant withdraw cpf than can he/she withdraw ownership from that unit but staying as tenant. can withdraw cpf?

Can, but unlike the past, you cannot use 100% cpf since the age + lease left is not equal to 95.

It’s cannot withdraw up to valuation limit for CPF to repay HDB loan. The quantum will also drop depending on how many years of shortfall for the buyer. 
The FRS part has always been in place. If one does not have a property to pledge, the FRS will need to be reserved. The add on condition now is that the property need to also have 40 years left (as compared to previously 30 years left).

I gave it a hard thought while in the shower.
 
this rule imply that a person cannot buy a unit with lease 6 years older than his birthdate. when he is at 55 yo the lease would be at 61.
 
it also mean parent cannot sell or transfer ownership to their children. no matter how I count the lease won't be able to cover their children to 95yo.
 
this lead to another question. those 3 generation unit. How the ownership like when come to cpf withdrawal. If I am the children surely I won't want to take over the parenting unit as it will impact my cpf withdrawal.

your 30 year to 40 year also food for thought. 
In Singapore there are many hdb build in the 70s /80s. I am sure some of us here still stay in one of such unit. 
 
if he was born in 1980 and the lease started back in 1974 than the lease won't cover him till 95yo.

I think can still use cpf to dbuy old flat but must make sure when hit 55 lease must be able to cover till 95yo.
 
born in 1980 one can't buy a unit with lease start in 1974. it will impact your cpf withdrawal when turn 55 yo.

HahaIf i remembered correctly they were the ones that was saying Singaporean are using way too much cpf to purchase housing and suddenly they allow this. Shouldnt they capped the payment age ceiling to 55 instead?

I think this article is clearer on the changes impact.
 
I don’t think it’s a plus or minus for old leasehold, but it’s a plus for old folks and a minus for young folks. 
 
This I think is the intention. The impact is also not that big

It is very important to understand what CPF is for. Then we also need to know why HDB has to cost your life saving and by artificially inflate the HDB prices, is it good for everyone? Next we can start to look for what else we can inflate to make people happier haha

True, but he can still use CPF almost up to valuation and loan almost to valuation as well...
 
The idea is to discourage someone from buying a flat older than himself (built before he was born).
 
If it was an inherited flat, he can / should swop it for a newer flat. If it is a joint ownership flat, he should do likewise.
 
This may also help moderate demand for older central flats and spread out demand to newer/less mature estates. 
 
 
 
your 30 year to 40 year also food for thought.In Singapore there are many hdb build in the 70s /80s. I am sure some of us here still stay in one of such unit.if he was born in 1980 and the lease started back in 1974 than the lease won't cover him till 95yo.

Key takeaway
 
 
Last year, nearly one in 10 buyers (9 per cent) bought a resale flat that will expire before they turn 95. About 1 per cent of private homebuyers did so.
 
As a footnote, quite thankful that properties I have intention to hand down are all younger than my children or freehold so there is more flexibility for them in the future. The one that won't is meant for me.

Can, but unlike the past, you cannot use 100% cpf since the age + lease left is not equal to 95.
 
Basically, with this new ruling, they encourage young buyers to buy newer flats and old people to buy old flats.
 
Which means the old flats will lose some demand from younger crowd.

 
 
Means mature estate HDB price will drop ? or at least expected to drop? 
Good move by garment, than the price of the newer estate HDB will be higher and younger generation will have no CPF for retirement.

Indeed, it's a wake up call on those who are buying old flats at inflated prices. Some hoping they will profit from en bloc sale, some for prime location or whatever reasons. It is not unique to SG though, most HK land leases expire in 2046 (27 years left) still selling for millions, and CN "right of use" are up to 70 years only. Hard to change the Chinese landlord mentality. I'm sure there will still be a lot of people with "gahmen won't let us die" mentality.
 
But of course, there are also a lot of youngsters who buy flats in very old estates just to stay close to their parents. 
 

Im just thinking out loud ... hahaha  
 
The concern is not the buying but the selling ... Say by the time U downgrade ur flat left 40 yr lease. Who will buy ? 
maybe those over 55 will buy .  Those in their 40s will buy flat with 55 - 50 yr lease flat , they wont buy ur 40 yr lease flat. 
At the end , old flat hard to sell.

Not really.
 
The criterion changes means now that older persons can now qualify for higher CPF usage and loan to buy older properties. Some of them really have accumulated abundant CPF in their lives! The key difference before and after is this unlocking effect.
 
Younger persons the rules reduce the attraction of older flats. So those intending to buy old properties now go for newer properties (flats and private).
 
Overall, it has a stimulatory effect on demand while supply stays constant.

Good move by garment, than the price of the newer estate HDB will be higher and younger generation will have no CPF for retirement.

Just want to lock in your cpf monies
They have been doing that since they start to raise cpf withdrawal age n increasing property price. That's the magical outcome of slowly eating away cpf monies....

The past also cannot use fully, for those remaining lease 59 years and below. Now this has been simplified to allow buyers of older homes to use more CPF, so long as the lease can cover the home-owners until they are at least 95 years old. This will provide more flexibility to buy a home.

It is a double edge sword. Older buyers can now use more of their cpf to buy older homes because it will surely cover them until 95.
 
But for younger buyers, they can't use 100% cpf for older homes now. For example, say a unit age 35 years old (64 years lease left). In the past, for this unit, anyone can use 100% of cpf to buy.  Now, if a buyer age is 30 or younger, he cannot utilize 100% cpf to buy this home since it will not cover him till 95.
 
The news on TV keep harping on older buyers can use more cpf now to buy older homes ( especially if less than 60 years lease)  but they never say much on the younger buyers.

Yeah, we all know that the older flats now can be purchase by older people using more cpf than in the past.
 
But the limit on the younger buyers are mostly not highlighted. 
 
And quote like the below while correct is quite meaningless:
 
"Mr Nicholas Mak, executive director of real estate investment firm ZACD Group, said that before the changes, buyers had to use cash if they wanted to buy property with 30 years of lease left. This resulted in property owners lowering the value of their property to incentivise buyers."
 
First of all,  the oldest HDBs are 52 years old or 47 years lease left. Which are the ones that are left with 30 years lease that could benefit from this new rule? Moving the no cpf use from 30 lease left to 20 years lease left sounded good, but I don't think there are many  30 years lease left properties around.

My understanding.
 
This is inline with VERS and the earlier announcement that not all HDB flats will be en-bloc under SERS.  It is very very long term planning.  G is putting in measures, first of many, to prevent young people from borrowing large sum to buy old flats at good locations thinking G will bail them out.  They don't want to bankrupt/ clean out the CPF of these buyers when they start to do VERS in 20 years time.  Another sign that G will be taking back old HDB flats at sub-optimal value (below current market market price, which has been going up despite it being a depreciating asset) for recycling to next generation. 
 
VERS will put a floor to buy back price but noone knows how this will be computed but a discount is likely, hence the new measures to cap excessive valuation.  
 
The asset enhancement story is now replaced with the reality that the musical chair game cannot go on forever like in HK.
 
Younger buyers are the one with ability to leverage and pay up, how this can be positive for old flats without knowing more about VERS is nonsense. Judging from this measure, it probably is not.  
 
Don't know enough, so please share your views if my understanding is not correct.

Govt is putting a lot of effort to do many delicate balancing acts.
 
The current situation is where some people when they were younger opted for the cheapest and best (central, large etc) option (be it landed, old central HDB etc). End up in a place where they ask for help currently but can't. For example, if they are left with 30 years lease (no loan and no CPF use), they can't get any decent price, and if they had chosen large / private homes, the Govt also can't bail them out. This presents a huge dilemma to Govt.
 
To tailormake one's age to housing means much less considerations need to be made in the future. One might need to survive on less food, but your house will definitely see you till the very end.
 
At the same time, it helps to unlock the use of CPF funds for the aged. This will alleviate the situation of huge million dollar stuck in CPF OA/SA but zero liquidity to deal with life's issues, especially between 55-65.

I got a question :
 
CPF withdrawal changes
 
CPF members need to have a property with a remaining lease to cover them until at least age 95 to be eligible to withdraw their CPF savings above the Basic Retirement Sum.
 
What this mean you CANNOT withdraw a cent if you dont have a flat cover up to 95 even u have more than BRS in CPF ?

Bro, it means this...
 
This rule actually has been in place for very long but it has been modified to include cover till 95 years old.
 
It means that at 55 years old, you need a place that can last you till 95 years old, before you can withdraw beyond your BRS (currently 80+K).
 
If today at 55 years old, you don't have a place with 40 years or more left, you need to have more than FRS (160K+) before you can withdraw.
 
If you have the place, then you reserve BRS (80+K) and can withdraw for amounts above that.

Bro , thanks for the advice . Sorry got another Q .
 
The other rule about buying 2nd property at 55 . It said , must have BRS set aside if my flat+age > 95 . 
 
1) Does this mean, even I have FRS amt in min sum at 55 , I just need to set a side BRS and can withdraw the  balance to buy 2nd property assuming pte property? 
 
2) Say I wan to sell my HDB 55 and buy another one , e.g. downgrade ... what happen ? 
      will they lock up FRS and left over use for my downgrade ?   The concern here is I end up with lesser fund for          downgrade . if I buy a newer flat with  +age > 95 , all I only need is BRS lock in .

1. Should be. 
2. I don’t think so. I really doubt they have bad intentions on this.
 
Nonetheless it is always better to have some kind of black and white from HDB / CPF.
 
In any case, once you have bought the replacement property, should be able to withdraw?

First of all,  the oldest HDBs are 52 years old or 47 years lease left. Which are the ones that are left with 30 years lease that could benefit from this new rule? Moving the no cpf use from 30 lease left to 20 years lease left sounded good, but I don't think there are many  30 years lease left properties around. 

 
This part is a interesting point .....  why they move the lower cap from 30 to 20 yr ... 
 
e.g. who can buy 30 yr left flat ........ generally should be someone at > 65 rite ... 
       basically , allowing those over 65 to use CPF to  change house ?  but why would anyone at that age 
        wan to change house ? If they dont have a house all the while , why would they wan to buy a house at 
         65 ?

I think more clarity will emerge over time. Agents should be trained to advise also.
 
Essentially this also does not stop those with excess CPF funds from loaning 10 years to buy a property with 30 years left.
 
Previously this option was not available. Only can full cash.

That's a very good question and a darn good point.
 
I wonder why too......and if the 65 years old buyer uses full CPF now to buy a 30 years lease left house, how does that affect his monthly payout?
 
Anyway, it is a real issue only 17 years later cos currently the oldest HDBs still have 47 years left.

wah... 
1.  allow seniors to monetise their current abodes through downgrading to flats with lesser leases to get more cash for retirement expenses
 
2.  take the pressure off hdb to build new elder flats with 30 years leases
 
3.  help to slow the depreciation down for these old flats

Young owner shld know that and the risk before they bought the house .  Possible if they Gian Png aiming for enBloc 
and buy old flat . Now kana bite. If they wan to sell now , likely elderly will buy only but they are not going to pay alot for it. 
Elderly also need the money in CPF for retirement . Most likely owner will LL sell at a lost to exit . 
 
 
For Old owner ma .... if they are old , no point to sell either ma . And who will buy rite ...... another elderly? 
From one old man pass to another old man   ?      Sell and get FRS stuck ... Vs pledge HDB for FRS ... no diff i think

For discussion purpose 
 
1. allow seniors to monetise their current abodes through downgrading to flats with lesser leases to get more cash for retirement expenses
 
-->  not necessary to go this way. senior can pledge their flat to CPF  >? 
           Even if they wan to go this way, their current flat will be rather old too . After selling off and 
           minus off FRS + INT etc .... not much benefit . 
 
 
2. take the pressure off hdb to build new elder flats with 30 years leases
 
-->  possible esp those Elderly Condo ... but as far as I know , the take up rate is rather low . 
 
 
3. help to slow the depreciation down for these old flats
 
-->  only in HDB's book . They likely depre it linearly over 99 yrs . Owner cannot sell wont affect them ma ...  
       In fact , if there is VERS , depre faster is even better for HDB .

U are too narrow in scope. Policy needs have a wider view. How about those 65 year old with fully paid private housing? Or people with hdb but not much cpf used? With the extremely low interest rates in the past 10 years, I suspect there are quite a few who do not use much cpf for housing, 
 
The point is I don’t think the 30 years or even 20 years serve much of a point. I think the pegging the cpf use to buyers age removes a hard cliff issue when u use solely the age of the property.

A 40 year old property can previously only loan 10 years with a very reduced amount amount of CPF that can be used.
 
The same aged property can now loan 20 years with corresponding increase in CPF that can be used.
 
Tell me that has no impact on someone willing and able to free his name to buy a second household (first individual) residential property, or a second private property, or purchasing a temporary stay property.
 
Certainly there is a stimulatory impact.
 
But for those less than 20 years left, really sorry. It’s meant to be a straight line depreciation till the end.

You win some, you lose some.
 
Age + lease >= 95 is a pretty neat idea. Now young people have to think twice before buying old properties.
 
Age 25, lease 70 years
Age 35, lease 60 years
Age 55, lease 40 years

Members here may disagree with me. But my observation is that they are encouraging people to buy newer flats. But unfortunately the newer flats are usually located in the non mature estates such as Punggol , Tengah etc. 
Essentially the young people buying a hdb these days will have to decide :
 
1) newer flat but in far places, longer commute time
 
2) old flat in good location, short commute time but may have to pay more upfront cash for their flat due to loan curbs despite lower asking price from existing seller
 
3) newer flat in good location such as Bukit Merah , Holland drive, Queenstown, this is the most ideal especially for those who work in the financial service sector in CBD, however, the purchase price is v ex, at least 1 million for a 5 room flat. Cpf may not cover fully and they have to cough up additional cash too.
 
All these options have a benefit and a cost component, won’t be easy for a young couple to decide but they will have to choose either one of them .

maybe .... but u may not know HDB dwellers .  last nite I think think again . Possible some after 55 - 65 wanted to downgrade , sell their 5 rm flat and buy 3rm. 
say after kids all married or partner bye bye ...  but then , i also think 1 big group will sell house and stay with kids . Some dont wan to  bother kids , then they can also go for elderly condo too. Newer and better facility.  So those wanted to get from open market is very limited . Mature town is very expensive even for old flat. 
 
If old man with pte housing wan to cash out ... you think they need this rule to get thru meh  ? These new rule will not affect these group .  If they lots of CPF lagi better, they can always get a >40 yr lease flat . No problem at all. I am sure these group will likely to wear rolex too ... T2's target  
 
There is no need for HDB / CPF to make so much change just to cater for this group ...... that is my point. The reason they
gave is Ho Kua (good to see) bo ho jia  , but just an excuse opener.  You get ? no get ? there is more to meet the eye 
  but then , some say I got Pa Jiao Bak ....

Anyway, it is a real issue only 17 years later cos currently the oldest HDBs still have 47 years left.

 
if one at 65 wan to buy  a house , new additional rule applies . based on what is written , anyone buy a flat after 55 , 
if age + flat lease > 95 ,  BRS will be lock in . 
if no house or < 95 , FRS will be lock in . 
 
If old man got house b4 or still have , I think old man will not be much affected since he will gain some Profit from sales. 
but if old man got no house b4 .... and kana lock in FRS . I doubt he will have much left for the house . So at the end,
big loan from HDB , maybe .  
 
The problem may come earlier ...... some pte owners only have 60 yr lease and expiring soon. But again, I think small numbers .

More Flexibility to Buy a Home for Life While Safeguarding Retirement Adequacy
 
9 May 2019
JOINT MND-MOM PRESS RELEASE
Rules on CPF usage and HDB housing loans have been updated to provide more flexibility for Singaporeans to buy a home for life, while safeguarding their retirement adequacy. The rules will now focus on whether the remaining lease of the home can cover the youngest buyer until at least the age of 95. If so, home buyers will be allowed to obtain maximum CPF usage and HDB housing loan (for HDB flat buyers). Those who do not meet this criteria will still be able to use CPF and take up an HDB housing loan, but the amount will be pro-rated. 2. The updated rules will take effect from 10 May 2019. Majority of home buyers will not be affected as they are already purchasing a property which lasts them to the age of 95. Updates to CPF rules for all properties Use of CPF for property purchase 3. Previously, the use of CPF to buy properties focused on the remaining lease of the property:
Remaining lease of property  Previous rules on total use of CPF
60 years or more  Buyer can use CPF to pay for the property up to the Valuation Limit (VL)
30 years to less than 60 years  • Buyer can use CPF if the remaining lease of the property covers the youngest buyer until at least the age of 80 • Total amount of CPF that can be used is capped at pro-rated VL
4. These rules have to be updated to take into account the changing needs and higher life expectancy of Singaporeans. Under the new rules, the total amount of CPF that can be used for property purchase will depend on the extent the remaining lease of the property can cover the youngest buyer to the age of 95.
 
 

 
 
5. To ensure prudent use of CPF monies, there will still be a minimum lease requirement for the use of CPF for property purchases. This will be lowered to 20 years (from the existing 30 years), in line with the existing criteria for HDB loans. CPF withdrawal rules after age 55 with a property 6. Previously, CPF members above the age of 55 could withdraw their CPF savings above the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) if they owned a property with a remaining lease of at least 30 years. This was to ensure that they have secured a home in retirement and a basic level of retirement income. 7. To encourage CPF members to have a home for life and to secure at least a basic level of retirement income, CPF members will now need to have a property with sufficient remaining lease to cover them until at least the age of 95, before they can withdraw their CPF savings above the BRS. This change is not expected to affect most CPF members, as all HDB flats and the vast majority of private properties have leases that can last a 55-year old member until the age of 95. Updates to HDB housing loan rules for flat buyers 8. Previously, buyers of HDB flats faced restrictions on the amount of HDB housing loan they could get to purchase flats with remaining leases of less than 60 years. 9. With this update, buyers will now be able to take an HDB housing loan of up to the full 90% Loan-to-Value (LTV) limit , if the remaining lease of the flat can cover the youngest buyer to the age of 95. 10. If the remaining lease of the flat cannot cover the youngest buyer to the age of 95, they can still take an HDB loan but the LTV limit will be pro-rated from 90%, based on the extent that the remaining lease can cover the youngest buyer to the age of 95. 11. Put together, these changes will give buyers more flexibility when buying a home for life while safeguarding their retirement adequacy. A summary of the updated rules on CPF usage and HDB housing loan is in Annex A. Examples of how buyers will be affected by the updates are in Annex B. Further details on the CPF changes are in Annex C. Implementation 12. The updated rules will apply to: • HDB flats: Flat applications received on or after 10 May 2019. • Private properties and Executive Condominium units: Option to Purchase or Sales & Purchase Agreement signed on or after 10 May 2019. • CPF withdrawals: Applications received on or after 10 May 2019. 13. Buyers can click on the following links to use the online calculators to compute their allowable CPF usage (public and private housing) and HDB housing loan: • CPF usage• HDB housing loan New flat Resale flat14. Buyers who bought properties before 10 May 2019 and are still servicing their housing loans will not be affected by these changes. Members who bought their property and turned 55 years old before 10 May 2019 can continue to apply to CPF Board to withdraw their CPF savings above their BRS under the previous rules. 15. Those who are mid-way through a property purchase can approach CPF Board or HDB for clarifications and assistance. 16. For enquiries, members of the public can contact: CPF usage • CPF Board Service Line : 1800-227-1188 • Write to us : cpf.gov.sg/askcpf HDB housing loan • HDB Sales/Resale Customer Service Line : 1800-866-3066 • HDB Branch Service Line : 1800-225-5432 Issued by : MND & MOM Date : 9 May 2019   
Annex A Updated Rules on CPF Usage and HDB Housing Loan
 
 

^For HDB flats, the point of purchase refers to the flat application date. For private properties and Executive Condominium units, the point of purchase refers to the Option to Purchase or the Sale & Purchase Agreement exercised date.   Annex B What The Updates Mean to Property Buyers A. Majority of buyers will not be affected by the changes. Example 1: Sammy and Devi are both 25 years old; they just got married and are buying their first home.
Age of Youngest Buyer 25 years old   Property Type   5-room resale HDB flat 85 years remaining lease [i.e. lease covers Sammy and Devi until at least the age of 95] Lower of Property Price or Market Value   $430,000
The couple’s maximum CPF usage and HDB housing loan limits are not affected by the updated rules. As the property covers them until at least age 95, they may also request to withdraw CPF savings above their Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) when they turn 55.
 

 
*Applicable limit for buyers who have not set aside the BRS. Usage beyond the Valuation Limit (up to applicable limits) is allowed if the property buyers have accumulated their BRS. Note: 1. Banks also take reference from CPF restrictions when assessing how much loan to lend. 2. Actual loan amount is subject to credit assessment which takes into account, among others, buyer’s income and age. B. Those who buy a home for life would face less restrictions on their CPF usage.Example 2: John (age 48) and Jane (age 45) are buying a flat to move closer to their parents’ homes.
Age of Youngest Buyer  45 years old Property Type 4-room resale HDB flat 50 years remaining lease [i.e. lease covers youngest buyer (Jane) until at least the age of 95] Lower of Property Price or Market Value $430,000
Under the updated rules, the couple may use up to $86,000 more of their combined CPF savings to buy the flat. Their HDB housing loan does not change. As the property covers them to age 95, they may also request to withdraw CPF savings above their BRS from the age of 55.

Banks also take reference from CPF restrictions when assessing how much loan to lend. 2. Actual loan amount is subject to credit assessment which takes into account, among others, buyer’s income and age. C. Those who buy a home with a remaining lease that does not cover them to the age of 95 will be able to use CPF and take up an HDB housing loan, with limits to safeguard their retirement adequacy. Example 3: Nick and Cheryl are both 25 years old; they just got married and want to buy their first home.
Age of Youngest Buyer  25 years old   Property Type 4-room resale HDB flat 65 years remaining lease [i.e. lease does not cover Nick and Cheryl until at least the age of 95] Lower of Property Price or Market Value   $430,000
Under the updated rules, the maximum CPF usage is reduced by $43,000 while the HDB housing loan is reduced by $38,700.

Banks also take reference from CPF restrictions when assessing how much loan to lend. 2. Actual loan amount is subject to credit assessment which takes into account, among others, buyer’s income and age. As the property does not cover them to the age of 95, they will not be able to withdraw CPF savings above their BRS from the age of 55 (except for the first $5,000 from the age of 55, and 20% of their RA savings from their payout eligibility age). If they buy a flat which has a longer lease coverage, they will be able to use more CPF. Their HDB housing loan will also be higher.
 

 
 
*Applicable limit for buyers who have not set aside the BRS. Usage beyond the Valuation Limit (up to applicable limits) is allowed if the property buyers have accumulated their BRS. Note: Examples above assume lower of price or market value is $430,000 across all flats. 
Annex C Further Information on CPF Changes Consequential changes to purchase of multiple properties using CPF: Previously, CPF members needed to set aside the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) before excess Ordinary Account (OA) monies could be used to purchase second or subsequent properties. From 10 May 2019, members who do not have any property bought using CPF monies that covers them until at least the age of 95 will need to set aside the Full Retirement Sum before using excess OA monies to purchase second or subsequent properties. Members who have a property with remaining lease that covers them until at least the age of 95 will not be affected (i.e. previous rules apply). Members in a buy-first-sell-later situation are not affected if they dispose of their previous property within the six-month grace period. Consequential changes to CPF usage after age 55: For purchases from 10 May 2019, the remaining lease of the property needs to cover the buyer until at least the age of 95 for the buyer to use Retirement Account (RA) savings above the BRS to pay for the property. Members approaching age 55 can ask CPF Board to reserve their OA savings so that they may continue servicing their mortgage payments after the age of 55. Those facing difficulty servicing their housing loans can approach HDB or CPF Board for assistance.

those over Million one are still young flats ... I think the new changes wont affect this group. 
Easily pass the 95 limit test . Or did I missed somethiing ? 
 
 
for those who have already bought flat over million , if they rich , no problem . 
 
if they expecting to make some quick $ ... I think this will become harder now.

$1 million HDB (usually):
 
- central (saves time for family's daily travel)
- near / at MRT
- plenty of amenities
- near workplace
- near premium schools
- (sometimes) premium address
- (sometimes) culturally rich areas
 
If rent such a place, the rent is probably around $3000-3500 per month based on today's low rent price. Some 30 years to recoup the full rent with some length of lease left.
 
May be a good deal for some if they can unleash the value.

Those people who buy the 1mil HDB aren't fools..
Huge units, great locations, lots of amenities..
 
For example, if the two blocks near Farrer MRT come on sale, I'll buy them in a snap... or the new Dawson area.. also very nice
You can smile at your neighbours who paid 2-3 times more for their fancy condos.

Those people who buy the 1mil HDB aren't fools..

The difference is in the potential capital appreciation.
 
The old HDB, while has great conveniences, spacious, etc.....has almost no chance of capital appreciation unless there is some form of policy change which the authorities are trying to tweak now.
 
The below chart tells you the current story.  All Condos $psf appreciation vs All HDBs $psf appreciation.

$1 million HDB (usually):
 
- central (saves time for family's daily travel)
- near / at MRT
- plenty of amenities
- near workplace
- near premium schools
- (sometimes) premium address
- (sometimes) culturally rich areas
 
If rent such a place, the rent is probably around $3000-3500 per month based on today's low rent price. Some 30 years to recoup the full rent with some length of lease left.
 
May be a good deal for some if they can unleash the value.

and the rules to rent out hdb keep changing and tightening

Let's take the three blocks at Commonwealth MRT. 30 plus stories high, with the train so close you can almost pee on it.
 
Take a couple or even a brace of close friends. Rent the place at say 3-3.5k and divide it up. The one who gets the master bedroom pays a bit more. 10 mins to Science Park. 15 mins to Orchard Rd. 
Market, food and weekends at Holland V. 
Ask the owner to spruce up the place, after all, it's 3.5k rental. Provide a new 55" TV and wifi and a decent toilet with hot water. All very standard requests.
 
Any takers? 
 
Plenty I'll say... Not everyone needs or wants a swimming pool and tennis courts.. of course Commonwealth Towers or Queens might be 'sexier' but these large HDB blocks have their attraction too..

hdb got 3 bedrooms 
to get that amount
at least 3-4 tenant ... 2-masterbed, 1-common, 1-common
worst is to get 6 tenants to split the cost
and toilet will be a huge challenge during peak hour to go to work
and the target are either prc, indian or pinoy FT
except prc ... most indian and pinoy FT all rent condo liao
1room studio or 2room sharing... easy to find roommate

The government is not trying to tweak policy to appreciate old hdb. If anything, they are tweaking it the other way. The recent drop in hdb resale prices is the message from government has finally sunk in. Don’t expect public housing to appreciate as it is not sustainable. 
 
At the end of the day, is the higher rental yield worth the higher depreciation ? Same argument as 99 years vs freehold. 
 
The answer is not that clear cut...

On the recent CPF moves for old flats, there are two camp of thoughts among the agents and agencies.
 
The first camp focuses on the positives....older folks can now use more cpf to buy older flats,  so that should bring more demand to old flats, at least sustaining their value.
 
The 2nd camp focuses on the limitation, that younger folks may be discourage to buy older flats now, so lesser demand on the older flats causing more depreciation.
 
Time will tell which way it will go.
 
However, if we look at all the other moves such as HIP2, VERS and enlarging the radius from 2km to 4km for proximity grant, it is quite clear that those moves are to help to sustain or increase the demand for older flats.
 
As for higher rental yield vs depreciation for older flats,  one has already lost the first 5 years of MOP period that they could not rent out the unit. The depreciation already had a head start for 5 years. I do not think the higher rental yield is going to be worth it in the end.

I also have the same thinking ... the 2 schools . and I sided the 2nd camp . 
 
i still think reducing the 30 yr to 20 yr min lease period has little impact . This can be seen as a positive act of 10 yrs benefiting older people age > 65  ... however, they also increased the min age coverage from 80-95 ... a reduce of "15 yrs " of potential buyers  age 50-60 .  
 
 
if anyone wan to downgrade , they would have done before 65 .  Selling their flat has no benefit from pledging . if they have alot of cpf , this scheme has no benefit . if they dont have cpf , this scheme doesnt help either .... ok just my own view .

if include INT , maybe alot more yrs ... 
 
on the other hand , people who pay such high price for BTO , likely for their own stay instead of renting out. 
if u buy for investment , u wont pay the highest price on record rite ?

Personally if I can choose, I will opt for the cheapest BTO and reserve the cash for private (upgrade or second property).
