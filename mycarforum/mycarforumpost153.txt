none.
 
just find a auspicious day  and time to start work, if your contractor cannot commit..
 
you have to diy, use a hammer and chip off a corner..
That's for the official renovation work.
 
if your house is vacant for a while, upon going in.
knock on the main door, then slowly open the door..
let it air for a while, for me.. a cigarette time
 
then go in and open all the windows to ventilate further.
usually this is done in the morning.
 
After everything has been done and ready to move in.
Find another auspicious day and timing.
This is important if you wish to host and pray.

If you're not those super superstitious type and don't even know what the usual practices are (it's ok I don't either), then why need to do at all?
 
If I roll a pineapple in my house without knowing why i'm doing so, just because people say I should, got any use meh? Isn't the intent more important than the action?

Yeah I guess no harm, just that your question got me thinking.
 
If I just go through the motions without understanding or intent, I wonder if the spirits/gods/whatever know whether I mean it or not.

Since you are not those super superstitious type but still a bit superstitious type
 
then maybe you can spend a few hundred.
 
The value of free advice is usually $0.
 
But if you still really want free advice then I suggest
 
bathing in pineapple juice when you first move in.
 
That will clear away all the bad influence in your new place.

Mr Chow, you forgot the most important follow up point.
 
The owner of the house must wear the RED underwear ON THE HEAD and then prance into the house machiam like lion dance.

The most important thing is to ensure the following:
 
1) Renovate when you're ready financially
2) Ensure that the design is to your liking
3) Choose a reliable interior designer and contractor
 
All the hocus pocus of feng shui tips such as drinking pineapple juice and placing coins under tiles won't work if you don't your act right LOL!!!

The most important thing when moving in is, BE THE HAPPIEST PERSON YOU CAN BE and never quarrel with your family.
 
You can move all your things in before the actual day. So your headaches and worries should not be brought along. The official move in date should be the one you spent the night sleeping in your new home.

I can only say is if you actually not bothered by all these Fengshui stuff, as it seems you are new to them since asking for Fengshui advice in car forum, then maybe just go ahead and enjoy the process of simply renovating and after that enjoy the new decor.
 
I never believe fengshui (or shall I say I choose not to be involved in fengshui).. Then sometime mid this year, office floor major Reno and all our settings got rearranged. And some colleagues ask Fengshui master come see see look look at new seating facing and arrangement. And they kindly ask me to join in. I just participated out of fun, paid some $$ for advice and some 比丘 and dragon ornament and now seating is kinda strange facing. I kinda regret it bec I feel like just reverting to arranging the table in the manner I like, but due to the Fengshui advice, I'm kinda stuck in between.

since you don't believe, you do what also has no impact on you. if you die die want to really know if got "thing" in your new home, then bring a friendly cat or dog to your new house before the actual day move. if cat/dog behaves as normal, then hosay liao lor. if not, then you consider plan B which might be one of the options described by he various forumers.
 
Why i say bring cat/dog? since they are supposed to be more sensitive to the environment than us due to better hearing, nose and eye sight, perhaps they might pick up some things humans cannot detect. Have you ever seen a cat stare at a blank wall (no dust, no insects) for long period of time? Or a dog barking for no reason?

Thanks and I would like to emphasise
It's not the 288 or 388 matter.
I am like our friend above, never or will not involve in Fengshui, asking for the tips is purely all those " basic & necessary " practice the folks were doing in the past.

The cat and dog thing not 100% accurate. Sometimes the dog or cat cannot detect if that "thing" is those quite powerful one.
 
Tested and proven when I feng shui for a few house.
 
House A - My friend's dog went into the house and behaves as normal. The dog is able to detect "something" at another house.
 
But another of my friend with 3rd Eye told me something is wrong with House A. My compass went a bit out too. Outside main door= North. Inside main door = North West.
 
Long story short. Was confirmed by a taoist master at later stage that House A was not clean with 2 spirits.

bring dog in newly renovated house it will sure bark... Dogs have such keen sense of smell... Newly renovated house full of turpentine and paint smell.. The dogs will bark bec it cannot stand the strong odors and human thought the dogs see good brothers..

You want a good date to open the resale flat for the first time to pray?
 
Or you want a good date to do renovation?
 
Need you and family animal sign to choose a good date and time. FOC for you
 
Btw, the Pineapple you need 2. 1 is for praying and 1 is to smash it onto the floor when you open the main door for the first time.

Fengshui depends on how far you want to follow. Imagine spending thounsands of dollar for a fengshui master. Later he tell u do this do that. You wanna do all boh? Nvr ending la. 
 
Just follow old chinese traditions can liao. Do the basics like pinpeapple rolling, choose good date, ventilate the house can liao. 
 
You want to follow everything, cannot finish one.

I totally agree on this.... Fengshui is for those wealthy people one, you follow, you will have to follow all the way.
One year see one time, buy this buy that....... That is why I said, I will never involve in Fengshui master because I am not rich
 
 
Afterall I started this topic, not asking about Fengshui either...... Comment and comment it becomes Fengshui
 
 
What i want to know is what will people normally do when their new house reno about to start..... As simple as that

Tried many houses. Normally the directions inside and outside is the same.

My friend engage his services. To be honest, the master only quoted $100 plus to settle the issues.
 
it's more like a transport fee. I am surprise by the low fee too.
