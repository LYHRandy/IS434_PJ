Could anyone give ideas on how i can renovate in a way to address this odd shaped or to break this odd shape?

Mod, you bought this house already?
 
Because if you haven't, is it possible you look at other units?

This unit can skip- centre of the unit is toilet and utility room no good- flush out the 'luck" of the house. odd shape living room - impossible to renovate- person who stay there will feel disoriented and distorted in thinking and will lead to mistake which will affect career. this is a pre-owned unit.
 
Choose a square or rectangle shape is better- if given a choice.

TS, since you are going to renovate it, why not leave it to the I.D to propose several designs for you to choose from? Are you planning to design your home yourself? and just get a contractor to build?

yes, Put the sofa in the middle of the room. TV console at the wall nearest the door. The wall beside bedroom 3, build a long shelf or storage along that wall.

Look like a design in the 90s with very bad fengshui consideration. 
 
141sqm for a 3bedder is good tho.
 
Problem would be solved easily if bedroom 2 is not needed.

double entrance condo is for maid. cannot use front door. must use kitchen door. 
 
 
this unit the iiving and dining together rook abit tight le..
 
anyhow suggestion:
 
unlimited budget reno then you can make a JDM genkan entrance with the odd shaped area, can put shoe/bicycle/plant/barang barang. Then no more odd shaped living. Put nice sofa in middle (bo bian), then TV console against bedroom wall. Top left corner of living put nice semi big sized plant.  (woody area slightly raised up)

I am not very good with interior design ideas so I personally like spaces that are functional which to my simple mind means square or rectangle.
 
Assuming this is what we have to work with, and ...
 
1. using my simple and cheap approach (ie minimal or no renovations)
2. power points and cable points are located at the common wall with Bedroom 2.
 
Here's what I would do.
TV put at the common wall with Bedroom 2.
Square / rectangle dining table parallel to Kitchen as close as comfortably possible.
Sofa facing TV will be in the middle of Living Room with enough space for a person to walk from main door to windows.
Balance space between the entrance and sofa ... maybe some display shelves or shoe space or secondary family area.

Donut, it isnt really odd.Thats becos the front door opens to the living room quite nicely.
Especially if the living room is spacious enough.
it is perfectly fine for sofa to "float in the middle" and moving space all around.  
Why should the sofa be constrained to be against a wall of the living room?
 
Small apartments in recent years have no choice but to put everything against the wall otherwise there will be no space to speak of but i dont think this living room is that small
 
The key in interior designing is in creating the right dimensions.
As long as that has been achieved to your liking, nothing is odd.
Odd can be beautiful too.

Maybe if TS family cooks at home then  I would seal the kitchen door and use that space for table top or shelving for oven microwave etc because the kitchen looks small already, that door eats up a lot of usable space, the maid can always use the front door.
 
I shift my dining table over to that area in front of the main door if like privacy can build a  shelving between door and dining area.
 
tv console will be along the outside wall of  bedroom 2 and sofa, coffee table in front of tv console.
 
since the area is odd shaped , I would not use too many bulky shelving and furniture, use false ceiling and downlights to emphasize the more squarish area.

if really don't mind your tv sitting slanted  (tv on left wall, sofa straight across in middle or against bedroom wall), maybe can consider trying a triangular coffee table to resolve the shape?like a Noguchi

the odd shape hall with some design should still be ok
 
maybe TS can consider the space utilization of this unit
 
there is a long aisle down to walk across the rooms
 
this walking space is kinda wasted & not ideal 
 
but if the price is right, this is not too much of issue too
 
what i like is the space this unit offers, pretty comfortable

For me, I would add an extra door to the utility room so that you can access it from the aisle as well.

Still considering this unit.  The size is good, v hard to find in new developments.  The new ones feel like prison cells.
 
the only other problem is its quite old. 1995 TOP. 99 leasehold only.  But its in a good location and big developmemt space.  Ideal for En bloc in future.  
 
Will continue to explore other units.

If i'm you, I take already. Old is gold. Unless there are similar developments in the resale market for about the same price range.

updated image with plant n sofa placeholder. plant is next to a window so should be able to get enough light to sustain. My place i put a number of indoor plants also, don't need much sunlight.  Plants can be used to soften funny corners and with a raise platform (even slightly), puts emphasis and importance (at least theoretically) in the living room which is where families spend their time together. 
 
There are also a number of books and magazines on how to incorporate plants into your living space. Gives spaces a less harsh feel and more relaxed feel imo.

i can sense the owner is rushing to let go. agent kept asking me how, what other concerns, price still can nego etc.  owner even willing to let go below bank valuation.
 
this unit needs to do some renovation.  Toilet, old kitchen cabinet, living hall floor, power switches.  Gonna to cost quite abit.  if i do additional renovation to break the odd shaped hall, will do more cost.  
 
will see how.

If you have not bought, then let me add a bit more comment on this house. I am no geomancy master, but basic geomancy will show that this unit has to be avoided besides renovation issues.
 
1) Center of the house surrounded by 3 toilets. Worse still, the center is right in front of the ultility room (storeroom) which is a dead space. Those house which has its center near to a toilet is already bad, think about having 3 of them and in front of a dead space.
 
2) The master bedroom is tuck away at the end or a long corridor. Live energy comes from the front and the master should get a good circulation of that energy but when it is right at the end due to the layout, it is really not ideal.
 
3) Too many missing corners for this house.
 
I am not sure what is the implication to the owners, but it is best to avoid this unit

If more budget and bedroom 2 is going to be a study, another suggestion is to do a nice glass partition to open up the visual space and allow even more light into the house and remove the walls around Bedroom 2 (and seal up the toilet door for bedroom 2). Adding a door will also segregate the living space for when entertaining guests and to have more efficient use of living room aircon. Removing bedroom 2 walls will also totally get rid of most of the long corridor.    (agar agar like the image below but flip the other way round)

Sure bro...I know not everyone is into feng shui, I am not very much into it either except for the basics which encourage "balance".. And I think "balance" is what everyone should be looking out for.
 
Well, not every unit can be a perfect rectangle or square or has perfect layout of rooms, but those that is truly lob-sided should be avoided.

I think the owner is rushing to let go because majority of the potential buyers are put off by the layout of the unit. 
thus there is a sense in the owner that it would not be easy to let go and agent also balls shrink, because 141sqm condo should be an easy sell.
 
Like you said, major overhaul most likely needed, some rewiring, build some fake walls to break the angled walls, all these you can calculate into your offer to the owner to mitigate some of your costs.
 
Most of all, make sure you are comfortable with the unit, the atmosphere (some people call it 'Qi' haha), the view, the convenience etc.

me too not too much into feng shui, but also curious to know some
 
I think "bad" feng shui can be balanced with something like adding partition, water pond, wood, some plants etc
 
last time saw a hdb unit at bukit panjang nx to a hill.  the unit made everything inside angled (not directly against the hill), totally 
 
most important potential buyer is overall comfortable with the environment inside/outside
the "balance" can adjust a bit here there later to new owner's likely if need to

Hmm ... then that has to be budgeted into the selling price as well as part of total cost to you.
 
I assume you are happy with the location, amenities, car park space and lots and its just this unit's layout only that is left for consideration ? and the asking price of course ...

to me it's not an odd shape since the sofa doesn't necessarily have to be against the wall.
 
size is good too.
 
my concern will be on the lease. 99years leasehold, TOP 1995, means the lease should have started w.e.f 1992 thereabouts.
 
assuming there's 76 years left in the lease, and you stay in it for 10 years, when you want to sell, i don't know if it will be difficult for the prospective buyer to get a loan if there's only 60+ years remaining.
 
unless the location is really tip top and there are not many condos around that area, then it should still be ok.
 
if you are comfortable with the points above, the last thing will be to check the latest AGM report. Check when was the last major refurbishment done, when is the next one coming up and what is the health of the sinking fund.
 
when i was scouting for my place, some condos' sinking fund is very low and the next major works are due in 1 year's time. It will be likely that the owners will be asked to top up cash to facilitate the repairs.
 
thanks. i'm not into fengshui.  from what i know, this unit only had 2 owners since 1995.  looks pretty stable.
