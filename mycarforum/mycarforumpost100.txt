Property Agent ain't a part time job unless you have a long list of personal clients upcoming.

You have to work 24/7 to generate clients.  They don't fall off trees.



 
 

agree, dun provide a disservice to your client.

How I wish its as simple as you mentioned. Haha.  
 

First you have to take the RES course and exams. After passing, you can choose which agency to register with and pay the admin fees and registration fees etc. Its tough to be an part-time agent. In order to see results, you need to really focus and sourcing leads is the most difficult part of the job.

You need to attend the RES (Real Estate Salesperson) course conducted by various company (CEA website for info) and achieve at least 75% attendance (IIRC) before you can registered to sit for the RES exam. Course fees will range from high of $700 to $900. Generally, around 3mths after you start your course before you sit for the RES exam.
 

There is no strict and fast rule on the comms, you can even do it for free if you want to   , however, market practice is 2% (or less) for seller and buyer 1%, commonly for HDB transaction.
 

For private property, only seller pays 2% comms, buyer don't pay.
 

Agent can only represent a single party (either seller or buyer, tenant or landlord) no dual representation is allowed.
 

A lot of law and regulations will be taught in the RES course  
 

not easy doing part-time, you need to have lots of ready clientele or else you may not even close a single deal during the first  year.

Not easy as it seems bro.  
 

You have to manage your time on your studies as well as clients expectations. 
 

Any wrong move, they complaint to CEA and is bye bye to your agent license, worse case is fine and jail term.
 

After all the courses ($1k+) and exam fees ($300+) still got many many fees to pay first before you can embark on your new career.
 

Most important thing is, are you eloquent and can sell ice to eskimos/sunlight to africans?

U choose when you want to work? You sure your clients are willing to follow your working style? If u no time to serve them, u can jolly well forget about them being loyal to u. So many agents out there, u are just another Tom, Dick & Harry.

Take the RES exam first.
 

Be warned that the course is not exactly easy. There are 2 papers. 2nd paper is tough.
 

I have the study materials with me.  Not that I want to take the course, but read for knowledge sake.
 

If you want to apply for the course, make sure you sign up as a NTUC member. Will get 50% off the course fee.

taxi driver? delivery man? 
 

previously when CEA was not in the picture there were literally thousands of legal and illegal and many part time agents.
 

Now only the strongest survive. 
 

If you are able to manage the time for your client to get that fat commission cheque then this job is for you. If not, my advice, dun drop into the abyss...

i understand what you meant.  probably you are not aiming to make a lot from ppty so that's why you have your own free time and then can serve the few customer you have on your hand.
 

but unfortunately i think it doesn't work this way.  to survive in this industry, you have to have a decent minimum threshold of network of clients .
 

below that you will not make money although you have your free time.  to be slightly above that threshold, you probably need to spend a lot of time on the job to reach that level.

from the client's point of view, i basically expect the agent to do *all* the running around ... solve all the problems, and when they do rentals, they should be handy to resolve any tenant/owner conflicts during the tenure of the tenancy (ie during a 2 yr tenancy, if the tenant run away after 6 mths - the agent will have to refund part of the comm, in this case, 3/4, or find a replacement tenant. a lot of these fees can be taken back from the guy who ran away ... if the owner/agent can find him)
 

it's not an easy job, but i have seen some agents really give 100% and collect decent 6 figure comms a year.

and on the flipside, i've seen lazy agents (that were lucky enough to get exclusive listings) sit on their ass, let the buyer come to them, and also close 6 figure comms 
 

lastly, one of my primary sch friends became an agent, but i couldnt help him since i dont do residential. for more than 1 year, he closed no deal at all. however, when i met up with him a few mths back, he managed to close 1 big bungalow (collected more than a quarter mil comm i believe) and his luck/confidence/transactions went up after that ...

yep but like i say, it may be futile effort.
 

property deals usually come mostly if you have spread your network wide and people don't trust those that are doing few deals only .
 

so when you work part time, your network is small and you find that most seller will ditch you for another agent.
 

you can probably depend only on close friends and relatives to give you the deal.  sometimes even they may turn you down if they have other agents to choose from.
 

in any case, most agencies have also set a minimal commission per year basis for agents to meet in order for them to renew licences. and last but not least, CEA rules now stands that agents have to inform their full-time employer if they are doing property deals on part-time.  if your relationship with your company is so good until they allow you to do property part time, then do it by all means.

The important thing is to be able to build your clientele.

Through means that do not betray yourself or your friends, and not through unscrupulous means by tapping on your family or love ones resources.
 

Those are the pre-requisities of being a good property agent.

if i not wrong, car sales commission are seldom base on % of purchase price especially sizeable part of the purchase price (Coe) goes back to the government and not the car dealership.
 

my friend's brother used to be at komoco motors.  during those times when COE was low, he sold so many units of car and rake in good income that he can afford a RCR condo.  but when the COE went up sky high, he was among the many who was retrenched.
 

the good thing about car salesman is that during good times, they hardly have to do any work.  people just walk into showroom to buy without much effort required from the salesman.
 

as for property agent, there's a bare minimum amount of work to put in.....cannot run away from that.  but the good thing is once the agent network is established, he finds deals quite easily.

That is the reason I don't want to do rental as a part time job   too many "additional" work to be done that is not really the salesperson's (formally called agent) scope of work (as spell out in the CEA salesperson's role and responsibility). 
 

In Rental, salespersons role is to "matchmate" the Tenant and Landlord, after that, it's between Landlord & Tenant.
 

Just like Chinese saying, "matchmaker will matchmate for the Marriage and but doesn't guaranty the Marriage will produce baby boy"

Not joking.
 
I am thinking of taking the RES course and exam for the fun of it, and also for the sake of general knowledge.  Not intending to be affiliated to any housing agencies.
 
Is there any expiry to to the certification obtained?  Thinking of keeping the RES certificate as a standby just like having taxi licence as a backup, in case I am forced to go through a career change a few years later.

CEA reply:
Please note that the RES course attendance certificate is valid for 2 years from date of attendance and the RES exam certificate is valid for 2 years from date of exam.
You will need to apply within 2 years of the validity of the exam certificate to be a salesperson.
Thank you.
Regards, 
Yasmeen Bibi (Ms), CEA 
 
 
To put it simply, you are supposed to register as a salesperson within 2 yrs after obtaining ur cert. If not, your cert will be deem as void and you will have to retake if you do want to be a salesperson again after the 2yrs period. But if you do register as a salesperson after obtaining your cert, there's also requirements to met yearly to qualify for annual renewal of license. Requirements such as minimum 3 deals per yr and accumulating minimum CPD hrs. Overall, I would still say its a lucrative business of your own if you follow the right leader. Cheers!

To be a property agent, you need to set aside $5000. $1.1k for RES and examination. $900 for registering into your estate agent and taking a compulsory QPPC course and RC course. Your 1st $1000 spent on marketing and $2000 to survive before you collect your first commission as commission are usually given out within 3 months from closing or for overseas project it might take up to 6 months. Good luck to you!

actually, more prudent to set aside 12 - 18 months of expenses
 
it is a risk to take, but rewards quite good
 
make 300k to 500k if you are hardworking & willing to learn
 
and can also have control over your own timing

that table wiping with 3.2k a day only got one such post in SG
 
property agent no barrier to entry. anyone who can pass RES can be one
 
after that is which market you target
 
whether u want to do HDB resale, run around all day for months just to close a $10k deal
 
or do overseas project. Bring 2 clients to seminar and collect $21k comm after that

there are around 30k agents in SG
 
most are either clueless, no strategy or part timers
 
my figures are based on those that i know - many are intelligent and willing to work hard
 
would u stand at the bus interchange and give out flyers if you are a former scholar? If so, $10k is prob what u will make in the worst month

ya lor. Not many willing to go door to door knocking, but hey it has proven it works. They think that by getting a namecard, all their friends/relatives/colleagues suddenly want to buy property.... 
 
It's hard hard work for the top earners in the early years. Of course still hard/tiring work even after you make it, but then again you get to choose

yes, hard work is the most impt ingredient to do well consistently.
 
Most are not capable of hard work hence the excuses like market is weak, volume is low etc
 
there is no secret success route. Just simple probability. Approach 1000 people, maybe 10 will listen to you and 1 will buy from you.
 
So if you want to close 10 deals a month, find a way to reach out to 10k people each month

How come 99% of the agents I met can't speak properly but still got senior marketing director title? some speak so badly that i am exhausted just to try and understand what they are talking abt..
The RES and qualification requirement only started 3-4 year back. Many agent today are auto converted from last time where any ah beng or seng can just join as agent or start they property company. Now all cannot, once get caught sure jail and fine. If you looking for agent, ask for their RES cert, these are all property trained and have min 'o' level, diploma or degree.

i think the odds are much better than your 1 in 20 for those who religiously follow our strategy
 
many are making onwards of $200k, which is way better than their previous jobs (usually in the lower rungs of the corporate ladder)
 
 
But i wouldnt consider it as "so much" cos you have to remember this is our total gross compensation.
 
For middle mgt white collar, if your pay is around $10k-$15k a month, i think your total compensation already likely to exceed the above average agents liao
 
(including CPF, benefits, allowance etc)
 
BTW since u mentioned abt MP, i thought their "pay" is really just an allowance? And tax free some more if i am not wrong

The RES exam is getting tougher that before. Taking the RES course is actually good for self knowledge whether or not you will become a property agent. Most of us should only be able to own just one property in our lifetime. No harm taking the exam to know more. All in should be less than 1k if I remember correctly.
