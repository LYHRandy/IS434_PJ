Anybody applying ? Which area? Just want to check what is the buying sentiment on the ground.  Or is it better to buy resale given the rather high price of the new balance flat, plus the resale levy.  The attraction is of cos the short waiting time and also is available in mature estate.

Those flats are enbloc replacement flats.  I bought a flat slated for enbloc back then.  paid quite a hefty COV.  ppl then thought i was stupid.  Looking at the price I paid for the replacement flat at that site in clementi and the price HDB is charging the public now, im wondering why the public has not slammed the HDB.  
 

HDB is asking people to pay $300,000 more than what I paid for the equivalent flat 3 yrs ago.  That's $100,000 per year!  And looking at the remaining flats, not as high as the one I got and the view not as good.
 

People should question KBW....

Coz end of the day, Singaporeans know that CPF money is not their money until 65.
 

So might as well make full use of it now.

Am unable to rationalize why the 5rooms are apparently e top seller. Diff bet. the 5 and the 4-room is the space for creation of a study room aka in the Living area. Just think it is not worth the hefty price difference.

You would have to give up your hdb and the 10% payment you made via CPF monies and then you can go ahead to buy your condo. 
 

You can also choose to falsely declare and get a condo, but what I heard is that HDB will let it go at the start, then behind come and re-posses your HDB flat for breach of contract.

what if i already moved in but not fulfilled mop? how do i give up? can be allowed to sell?
 

a little clarification about "buy". if i moved into hdb for 2yrs already, can buy a condo that would only be ready to move in after i fulfilled the mop? technically i am the legal owner of the condo but it is still under construction so it's not physical.
 

if i can only apply to buy a new condo after fulfilling mop without penalties, then it means that i should not dream about living in a condo in the next 10years since 3yrs bto build time + 5yrs mop + 3yrs condo build time?

5 years MOP only starts when you get your keys. 
 

Within this 5 years, by hdb policy, you cannot get a private property(includes options for purchase, down-payment or full payment of any sort which would include your name in the title deeds of that property). Technically, it's around 8 years considering that BTO takes 3 years and MOP 5 years. For condo, you can get one that is already built. So within these 8 years, you can forget about pte pty. 
 

Overseas maybe still can squeeze through the net. Sg basically can forget it.

Actually horh, hasn't the prices of BTO's been increasing lately?
 
 

I mean, it's all thanks to the high over-subscription of application, that inadvertably pushes up the prices for BTO's right?
 
 

I still don't understand why people will get a BTO in the mature estates especially like Redhill/ Queenstown area- 5rm BTO from $611k, 5-rm resale, that's much much larger, goes from $750k. Having paid so much, $140k extra shouldn't be a problem right?
 
 

I don't understand these people. Thanks to them applying for BTO in matured estates, they're also pushing up the prices in new areas, especially Punggol and SengKang!!!!

Buy new - 

no need to pay COV

much lower fitting-out cost

fresh tenure
 

Acknowledged that BTO flat is rather small, but am skeptical that the resale one is much, much larger than the former.

Perhaps. But even if you compare flats of similar sizes (Take the Ghim Moh/Queenstown SBF and the surrounding Ghim Moh resale prices),you will see that it is still substantially lower even after accounting for the 30/40k subsidy.
 

The Ghim Moh flats are also available almost immediately so I can see why people are attracted to it.

Yes, all these fee can be paid using CPF. 

If you dont see yourself being able to pay off the entire loan within 10 yrs.. it will be better if you take HDB given that it's interests is fixed to CPF interest.

If you think you can clear the loan within 3-5 yrs, then bank loan will be better, interest rate will remain low in the next 1-2 yrs ,thus it work out cheaper to get a bank loan. But note that once you take bank loan, you cannot go back to HDB loan anymore.

If is also a good prac to "store" some of your CPF in managed funds, before HDB wipe out your cpf acct. These will be your emergency fund if you stop contributing to CPF for a good period of time.

This is the BAD thing. 

Most will have ZERO CPF every month as they have 400k to repay and mostly are shared between H & W equally.

What if one of you lost the job ?
 

In the past we can leave some in CPF and if anyone lost job the remaining CPF can pay for at least 3 years without any worries.

bad, 

cos if suddenly lose job, 

then no OA balance, then eat your cash 
 

so there's some ways to "invest" the extra portion away 1st, 

b4 HDB swipe away all OA balance.
 

liquid enuf to divest, when you need $$ in OA

I don't understand these people. Thanks to them applying for BTO in matured estates, they're also pushing up the prices in new areas, especially Punggol and SengKang!!!!



 

In any case, i think buying matured estates is really worth it even at this price. 

On the long run, flats in these estates appreciate faster. During mkt downtime, there is no lack of buyers. 

After mop , if you decide to rent, these flats also guarantee good and CONSISTENT rental yield given its ideal locations. 
 

Also with the notion that some point in time gvt going to increase vehicle toll, in term of ERP or GPS system, being located near to town means saving also. 
 

Bukit merah i think is best for investment (capital appreciation/rental yield) while Clementi and Ghim moh will be great for new families, as there is SAP school within 1km.

Eh, it seems like the worry is about the lack of money to pay if H or W lost the job. So it must be a case of H and W earning alot such that their CPF contribution to the OA is more than the amt used to service the loan or the loan taken is little and that it does not deplete the CPF contribution totally.
 

Then there's a serious issue here. Either the ppl buying housing are biting off more than what they can chew or the govt is not doing anything to provide security by buying a public housing. Talk about having a stake in the country...

Which is better ?

Wipe out both H & W CPF, monthly each $800 pay loan, and each balance $400 into CPF.

Each hold back $20k in CPF but each pay $1000/mth with $200 into CPF ?

This is the issue why so many Sgeans are so unhappy and many say they are Whiners.

BTO 5415 7047 (1.30 times over-subscribed)
 

What are the chances of getting Bukit Merah 4RM ?



 

please comment or correct....
 

I believe most applicants are 2nd timer to SOBF say BM.
 

1st of all, only 2nd timers have the means to afford BM-SBF. why? they have existing HDB which they bought long time ago and the property has appreciated = substantial paper gain. eg bought $150-200K , 10-15years ago and loan almost or fully paid off. Now maybe worth +- $500k

So to them, upgrading to BM-SFB bcas of good location and future potential capital is affordable to these 2nd timers.   
 

Also look at the over subscripition!!! how can so many average 1st timer apply for the high price SBF?? paying the 20% downpayment is crazy for 1st timer $100k!! plus stamp duty/ renovation, planning to have babies...will be burden for them if they choose this route. Most likely,  better off applying to BTOs.
 

if some 1st timers have $100K, they must be high income earners or high fliers...they will go for fancy condos instead.
 

so , my conclusion....the over subscription are mostly 2nd timers......

Too many cash rich PRs and new SCs will not blink eyes when buying these super high prices flats
 

Unhappy also no use, you still need a place to stay



 

dun be ignorant ok? PRs can only buy resale flats and its mostly the sinkie owners who asked for sky-high selling prices+COV to push up the resale index and also the new ache-dee-bee BTO/DBSS prices indirectly

I am not, just want to point out PRs do contribute to HDB price surge, do you know how many PRs own resale HDB and private properties in SG?
 

Are there any other countries that allow PRs to buy govt-owned flat/apartment?

Will HDB allocate 95% for 1st timer for SOBF?
 

I think most are 1st timer for BM SOBF because of the good location, maybe some are just applying for good Q number?
 

I agree the loan will kill some young couples, because taking a loan of $500k for 4RM flat is no joke, the accrued interest can be as high as $150k!

In the 1990s a 4 room flat is around $120k  <Bak Cho Mee Dried = $2.50 per bowl>

In the 2010s a 4 room flat is around $590k  <Bak Cho Mee Dried = $3.50 per bowl>

Price of flat after 20 yrs = 5 X times

Price of Bak Cho Mee Dried = 1.4 X times
 

No wonder so many Sgeans are so unhappy...



 

Bro..... your definition is the best la!!!!

precisely why so many ppl cry father cry mother...

but still not loud enough for the govt to take any drastic actions.

They build more to satisfy the demand...

but ignore the pleas to lower the price...

But can young couples afford the super high prices (4RM >$490K, 5RM > $600K) at BM and Queenstown?



 

young couples also got high earners.. mayb commision driven type, can hide some income so that they would be eligible for HDB :)
 

when I tried to ballot HDB previously, i tot I hav no chance, house too exp..
 

now I pity my frens and peers who are getting married and trying to buy house. with the avg salary they earn, and high house prices.. likely to be in high debt for many years to come, no extra $$ for holidays or kids..
 

Shopped for HDB in 2005..

HDB in bishan, 4rm then was 400 to 500k

The same unit is now possibly 700 to 800..

This is just 4brm below 100 sqft.

Ture, but how many % are high earners? 5%, 10%, 50%?
 

You were the lucky one to get Bishan at low price, but can you sell your flat now? Where are you going to stay?

The sad fact is the damage is already there and there is no way the newer flats can reduce in price.

Once they reduce the prices for new batch of BTO flats all those who took the current ones will KPKB one.

The only solution for HDB is to MAINTAIN the prices and not increase it. 

Maintain price  = reduce the rate of accum of National reserves, but Current owner quite happy but some new owners tulan.

Decrease price = further reducing N R and many current HDB owners Voters Tulan...

Increase price = Increase N R and many current HDB owners happy by new owners Tulan.
 

guess what those scholars decision will be ??

Well I just applied online for the SOBF in Queenstown as first timer.
 

I should have bought these BTO few yrs ago but due to siblings married and moving out,
 

I have to take care of my mum and thus, staying with her since my dad passed away.
 

I got about 225K in CPF OA and CO have around 200k in CPF OA. Both 37 yrs old which make us old couple.
 

The 4 rms in Queenstown should cost around 550K and with grant around 510K. 

(My mum will sell the current 4room flat in Clementi if I got the SOBF. Well, 400k cash for her retirement, 100K back to her CPF)
 

Our combine CPF OA ard $425K and I think we are taking a HDB loan of ard 90K. 

(She will be quitting her job and rest for a while to avoid the income ceiling issue)
 

I think it's still quite affordable for me at the moment.
 

I did think of going for private like condos but well, do not want to have a huge loan or paying thru our nose

for the monthly installments. 
 

Just settle for HDB flat will do which I can clear the loan within 5 yrs.

housing prices will be heading north

so it seems
 

Developers go all out to woo Chinese buyers
 

28 Sept 2011

Straits Times
 

BEIJING: Ever since Mr Jacky Zhang visited a few Singapore booths at an international property fair two weeks ago, his iPhone has been ringing with invitations to join special property-viewing group tours in the city-state.

'These (Chinese) agents made it sound like a first-class holiday: My wife and I would stay at a five-star serviced residence in Singapore, be chauffeured around in a BMW to view condos and then shop to our hearts' content,' said Mr Zhang, 34, who works in the finance sector.
 

Although his original intention at the fair was to check out Australian home prices, he quickly got distracted by the enthusiastic sales pitches of companies such as Far East Organization, United Overseas Bank, Credo Real Estate and Chinese consultancy Shuangcheng, which claims to represent small Singapore developers.
 

'They offered me advice and attractive rates on everything from Singapore's rental yield to mortgages,' he said.
 

Mainland Chinese have become the top foreign buyers of Singapore property, which is seen as a good investment even amid fears of another global recession.
 

'A strong, stable Singapore dollar appeals to these Chinese buyers as they seek to diversify their funds. The absence of capital gains tax... and plentiful property information available also appeals to them,' said Knight Frank Knight Frank research head Png Poh Soon.
 

Other factors include Singapore's economic stability, its proximity to China - a six-hour flight from Beijing - and an excellent bilingual education system, added Ms Sara Zhang, who heads Far East Organization's Beijing office. 
 

The number of private property deals sealed by foreigners and permanent residents in the second quarter made up 30 per cent of all private home sales in Singapore, according to a report by DTZ Research.
 

Chinese nationals accounted for just over a quarter - 26 per cent - of such purchases. Other foreigners include Indonesians and Malaysians.
 

And despite tougher Singapore immigration procedures and climbing property prices this year, Chinese buyer interest remains strong, say agents and developers. 
 

No wonder then that many agents and developers from Singapore are rushing to China to woo well-heeled investors.
 

They face a huge market - China has more than a million millionaires - but also stiff competition from other popular investment destinations like the United States and Australia.
 

So Singapore players are coming up with ways to make their potential customers feel special.
 

For one thing, they are spicing up the traditional property talks in dingy conference rooms with monthly 'Wealth Enhancement Seminars' at fancy five-star hotels.
 

Here, snazzy power-point presentations are sometimes accompanied by a buffet spread, which may even include durian puffs, to whet investors' appetites for apartments selling for as much as $2,500 per sq ft.
 

To attract attendees to these events, agents send out mass text messages.
 

One reads: '15 per cent discounts on Singapore property; first three people to sign up for seminar will get free round-trip airfare to Singapore!'
 

Another way to pamper Chinese investors is through property-viewing tours. Major developers like Far East and CapitaLand organise such three-day trips once or twice a month. 
 

Tour groups, which depart from major metropolises like Beijing and Shanghai but often include rich families from smaller cities, typically have 10 to 15 people.
 

'We intentionally keep the group small to ensure more personalised service,' said a CapitaLand spokesman, adding that these tours will cover four or five properties that best fit the prospective buyers' needs.
 

Popular CapitaLand projects include D'Leedon - located near Nanyang Primary School - and Latitude and Urban Resort, which are close to mainlanders' favourite brand-name goods boutiques in Orchard Road. 
 

Tour participants have to pay for their own airfare and hotel, sometimes at discounted group rates. But developers could pick up the tab for those who put a down payment on a property, said Mr Eric Chau of Colliers International in Beijing.
 

This incentive - along with lavish seafood dinners - is said to have helped clinch a good number of purchases, although developers are coy about revealing the numbers.
 

'Take-up (of properties) has been positive' was all a Far East spokesman would say.
 

To get even more up close and personal with potential buyers, more Singapore players are setting up their own offices or expanding in China.
 

CapitaLand Residential will open a showroom in China early next year. Far East's Beijing office has moved to larger premises in the business district.
 

Meanwhile, consultancy OrangeTee is in the process of setting up a Shanghai office and has also partnered China's largest online property portal Soufun to handle its queries on Singapore property purchases.
 

'This is a good time to set up our own office in China. We see an opportunity to serve Chinese customers who are looking overseas now that they are restricted from buying more than two properties in China, due to government rules introduced this year to cool the property market,' said OrangeTee executive director Steven Tan.
 

The company has helped a number of Chinese buyers with their purchases, including one man who bought 19 units, each priced between $2.2 million and $6.3 million, at one go near Orchard Road.
 

After hearing so much about Singapore's hot property scene, Mr Zhang is considering taking up tour offers to the Garden City.
 

'I'd like to be treated like a VIP too.'

bro, i dont think that is the issue.

he mention if he get the house, his mother will sell hers and have 400K retirement fee. which i think, the reason is to help his mother cash out. that is why i am asking if getting a new house is important. if not, i think buying from mother is good enough.

What is your combined income now? How can your wife quits her job to avoid the income ceiling issue?
 

HDB wants the last 3 months pay slip on the time you apply the new flat.

(My mum will sell the current 4room flat in Clementi if I got the SOBF. Well, 400k cash for her retirement, 100K back to her CPF)
 

Our combine CPF OA ard $425K and I think we are taking a HDB loan of ard 90K. 

(She will be quitting her job and rest for a while to avoid the income ceiling issue)
 

I think it's still quite affordable for me at the moment.
 

I did think of going for private like condos but well, do not want to have a huge loan or paying thru our nose

for the monthly installments. 
 

Just settle for HDB flat will do which I can clear the loan within 5 yrs.



 
 

you are the right buyer for these mature estate flats; not a young couple who onli worked a couple of years and hv maybe 20-30k CPF. 
 

my advise to u is to buy the biggest, most expensive flat u can afford (and not a 4-rm) since you're in a strong financial position. you'll thank me for this advise 5 years later.

bro, i dont think that is the issue.

he mention if he get the house, his mother will sell hers and have 400K retirement fee. which i think, the reason is to help his mother cash out. that is why i am asking if getting a new house is important. if not, i think buying from mother is good enough.




To buy a new flat and later Mum sell her flat is better than to buy over mum flat lah.

The first case is there are 2 flats involved and the latter only 1 flat.

What is your combined income now? How can your wife quits her job to avoid the income ceiling issue?
 

HDB wants the last 3 months pay slip on the time you apply the new flat.




5yr back when i got my first SOBF, some of my neighbour quit after they confirmed getting the flat, so to avoid the income ceiling. e.g. hubby 6 k , wify 5k... wife quits.. and wait until all form submitted to hdb. Then apply for job. Last time you only need to procedure payslip when you chose the unit. 
 

Now they require you to declare during the applicaitons, so difficult for you to "trick" HDB as you cannot be quiting 3mth ahead before the ballot. And  ballot also not confirmed get.

Crazy! Most opt for SOBF and those go for BTO have high chance to get a new flat
 

http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/S...ory_717589.html
 

Huge demand for HDB's 'leftover' flats, muted response to BTO launch
 

The sale of 'leftover' Housing Board (HDB) flats - many in popular mature estates - has attracted an overwhelming response, with more than 14,000 potential home-buyers applying for them.
 

These 2,847 flats, called 'balance flats', are a mix of those left unselected from previous build-to-order (BTO) launches, surplus replacement flats under the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme, and those bought back by HDB.
 

And because so many people went for them, a parallel BTO exercise for new flats launched the same day has seen a muted response. Some BTO estates and flat types were even undersubscribed with just one day left to apply.
 

Applications for both exercises close on Wednesday.

if not, there is another way to do that. if you SOBF fail you can buy the flat from your mother directly.
 





 

Well, I don't think I am able to take out or see my CPF money when I retire.
 

Why don't I make full use of it?

Combined income is ard 11K but my wife is income + commission which her company don't contribute

CPF for her commission + allowance. Her company is going to include all these as her basic quite soon.
 

So my basic income + her basic is about 9K+ at the moment.

i'm referring to pte properties where the buyer profile is international. tsunami will further choke the supply if the 40% d/p remains.
 

new hdb on the other hand is a basic need where supply is easily tweaked, limited to pink ic, earn less than 10k, cannot own pte b4, cannot this b4-cannot that b4.....  . if not for some of these restrictions, i would happily buy the most expensive mature estate new hdb flat as the potential capital appreciation and even rental yield is stupendous.

A. Dump all CPF OA into your new flat and pay 80k HDB loan, a bit risky if out of work
 

B. Dump only 20% CPF OA into your new flat and pay the rest monthly using HDB loan and let 80% OA earn 2.5%pa interests

Actually I have not really think of that as still waiting for the balloting results.
 

But first thing I will do is to transfer around 40K out of my CPF OA to those unit trusts
 

or investment funds as advise by my property friend. This 40K will be my backup 
 

just in case any 1 of us got retrench or out of job.

coz not many new hdb buyers hv this kinda $$ ready. 5-yrs later you'll prob want to 'upgrade'. once u get used to staying in a mature estate, you'll prob wanna stay put in the area. if u buy condo in the same area of the same size, you'll land up paying 3 times more. might as well hedge yourself and get a flat which has the highest potential capital appreciation since affordability is not an issue in ur case. at least if u move to a condo, the price premium is less compared to moving from a 4-rm to a condo. since you're onli 37, think long term and make the future work for u n dun be bogged down wif negative, self-defeating thoughts like retrench lah, no OA for retirement lah.

Better keep some buffer in case no income. I made the mistake many years ago and had to pay HDB monthly installments by cash.



 

The mistake u made was not saving up enough cash along the way. Cpf money has limited use. Best to use it all up. If u dun have the discipline to save cash, go learn cos ur cpf money is not going to buy u food, electricity, water, etc. Hdb is generally not so bent on repossessing ur flat immediately. 
 

Cpf money and cold hard cash has equal value but the latter has unlimited use. Keep more of the one that is most liquid.

The sad fact is the damage is already there and there is no way the newer flats can reduce in price.

Once they reduce the prices for new batch of BTO flats all those who took the current ones will KPKB one.

The only solution for HDB is to MAINTAIN the prices and not increase it. 

Maintain price  = reduce the rate of accum of National reserves, but Current owner quite happy but some new owners tulan.

Decrease price = further reducing N R and many current HDB owners Voters Tulan...

Increase price = Increase N R and many current HDB owners happy by new owners Tulan.
 

guess what those scholars decision will be ??



 

Scholars will probably say its a honest mistake no matter what decision they make...

then they will say singaporeans should quit complaining and help them think of solutions...

and when elections come, results out...

and maybe 45% this time "Dunno what to say"

I had received the email reply from HDB.

BTO (2nd timer) : Quee no is almost 2000 for 1041units (chances very slim).
 

The previous BTO (during 2008), my mum quee no is 1600 for 700 units.

She also got the unit at #08 floor. Many people cancelled/give up during that period.

Dont know why.

Let's say I chose a flat for Sep 11 BTO. Roughly how long I have to wait before I get the keys ?
 

 I heard rumours that it is usually much earlier than the Estimated Delivery Possession Date.

Coz end of the day, Singaporeans know that CPF money is not their money until 65.
 

So might as well make full use of it now.
 

And I agree! In land scarce Singapore, Capital investment I say.



 
 

after deducting a 30yrs house loan,by the time reach 65,i dun tink there will b any $$$ left in CPF account for a average earning person... 

so cant really say CPF is our $$$...its for the govern to suck back...

everything has gone skyrocket ... it'll never be the same anymore ever since Marlboro Tan instituted the "market rate" rule..
 

gone are the days where on a single income, you can pay off your HDB in less than 15 years, like most of our parents did..
 

my dad paid off his 3-rm in less than 10 years, single income.. my father-in-law paid off an exec maisonette in less than 15 years, single income
 

now, the wife and I have to empty our CPF, and still pay for the next 30 years, DUAL income.. that means.. it's 60 years to pay off our HDB loan..

Saw this thread after I got my SBF. I think if I had read this thread before I submit my application for SBF in Late April (I will be too worried about my chances to apply) I will still be houseless now hehehe!
 

Anyway I applied for SBF in late April for the March 2012 SBF and by 30 April I got my queue number. I dunno anything abt HDB rules or chances in SBF because I have stayed in a condo for 12 years and has been renting all this while. I was invited to book a house in May. Yes I did not get the house that I aimed for but I got another unit that is not too bad. The area that I applied for is Bukit Merah and honestly it's blardy expensive. But looking at the price of houses now, it definitely will go up. However I'm not the 'buy and sell to upgrade' type so having a house in a prime location is a good backup. 
 

Therefore, I got a house in an area that is very oversubscribed... But I'm very lucky to get a brand new house in less than 5 months. So sometimes there is a guardian angel watching over us without us realizing it. 
 

So to all bros trying their luck in SBF rather than wait for a BTO to be completed, the very best of luck to you! Things may just work out like it did for me...

Good luck to all who applied to Sep 2011 BTO and SOBF!
 

Looked like so many (40%) 1st timers applied under the MCP Scheme which has 4 chances.
 

http://mndsingapore.wordpress.com/tag/bto/
 

14,000 applied for 4,000 May 2011 BTO units
 

65% were 1st timers
 

55% (1st & 2nd timers) were making their first BTO attempt 
 

50% of 1st timers are married
 

40% of 1st timers applied under the Married Child Priority Scheme
 

45% of the applicants were making their repeat BTO attempts
 

14% of the applicants had applied for three or more previous BTO exercises in the last one year




IMHO, All these scheme are rubbish....

First time I apply, 2km near parents, married child priority - I got out of Q. 

Second time I apply, 5km away from parents, married child priority, I got Q# 7 while my friend, stay 2km, married no kid, out of Q.

  Defects reported in BTO flats constructed by Soilbuild – firm linked to PAP grassroots
 July 15th, 2014 |  Author: Editorial


Defects, such as the wall skirting falling off (above) and uneven tiles, have been reported for about three in 10 units in Tampines GreenLeaf BTO flats (Photo ST)

About 3 weeks ago (27 Jun), TRE published an article highlighting that new residents moving into HDB BTO flats in Anchorvale Horizon at Seng Kang were complaining about the defects and poor workmanship found in their newly completed flats (‘Complaints against poor workmanship in new HDB flats‘).
It was so bad that the grassroots leaders at Anchorvale Horizon were themselves complaining about the problem too. The grassroots leaders even roped in Seng Kang West MP Lam Pin Min to visit Anchorvale Horizon just to show him how terrible the defects are.
As it turned out, the construction company responsible for the Anchorvale Horizon BTO project was China Jingye Engineering Corporation Limited.
Yesterday (14 Jul), the media reported that defects and poor workmanship were again found in newly completed HDB BTO flats. This time, it’s Tampines GreenLeaf.
The Tampines GreenLeaf residents were so upset with the workmanship that they have also approached their MP, Baey Yam Keng, to address the issue. They also set up a Facebook support group to exchange information with each other facing the defect problems in their flats. They also want to meet Education Minister Heng Swee Keat, the MP for Tampines GRC, to get him to help.
“I was shocked at the number of defects. I felt very upset and short-changed,” said Ms Teo, a new resident at Tampines GreenLeaf. When she entered her new 4-room flat last month, she was shocked by the plain brown of its timber skirting.
“It was quite an eyesore. That kind of brown is not even like normal wood,” she said. The sample they saw when selecting their flat had visible wood grain. That sort of skirting is in place for the first two Tampines GreenLeaf blocks, 522A and 522B but not hers.
Another resident, Mr Simon Ng, complained about the widening gaps between the skirting and the wall. “The defects will definitely delay my plans for moving into the new house,” said Mr Ng. “The worst is that during this period, I have to pay for two houses, which is tough.”
Other reported problems by the residents include uneven tiles, chipped walls and rust stains.
HDB acknowledged that out of about half (430) of the flats handed over so far, 30% have reported problems.
MP Baey tried to downplay the problems by saying, “When you have a concentration of interest and views, it just reinforces or heightens feelings.” He said he has received just five to 10 e-mail messages.
Nevertheless, Mr Baey and Minister Heng are arranging to be briefed by the HDB and then to meet residents. HDB said they are doing their best to address the feedback.
Contractor is Soildbuild Construction Group Ltd
Tampines GreenLeaf is situated at the junction of Tampines Avenue 6 and Tampines Avenue 9. The BTO project consists of 960 flats in total [Link]:
96 units of 2-room flats
160 units of 3-room flats
384 units of 4-room flats
320 units of 5-room flats
According to HDB [Link], the successful tenderer for this 960 unit BTO project was Soilbuild. The building works were awarded to Soilbuild on 26 Sep 2011, 3 years ago, at value of $131 million:

Hence, the average cost of constructing each HDB BTO flat in Tampines GreenLeaf works out to be $136,458.

Soilbuild Executive Chairman Lim Chap Huat BBM (Photo: Soilbuild Annual Report 2013)

Soilbuild’s Annual Report 2013 filed with SGX [Link] also confirmed that Soilbuild was the contractor behind Tampines GreenLeaf flats. In his message to the shareholders, Executive Chairman of Soilbuild, Lim Chap Huat, said:
“We benefit from the ability to tender for public sector projects in Singapore of unlimited contract value as our subsidiary, Soil-Build (Pte.) Ltd., has an ‘A1′ grading issued by BCA. While engaging in public housing contracts such as our Tampines Greenleaf project forms part of our drive to support national development, this contract award also serve as testimony to our commitment to construction activities of a higher standard. We are pleased to have secured two new public housing contracts during the year under review and will strive to undertake more national construction projects in future.”

Soilbuild made news in May last year when it welcomed the Govt’s 6.9 million Population White Paper.
Ho Toon Bah, executive director of Soilbuild, said, “The 6.9 million population figure is good news to us. It means that there are more houses to build and more jobs for us!”
Lim Chap Huat then added, “We intend to further develop our position in the public housing sector as HDB ramps up the construction of public housing in the coming years. We believe that our track record in public sector projects puts us in good stead to compete in future tenders from the HDB and other public agencies.”
Who is Lim Chap Huat?
It turns out that Mr Lim Chap Huat is a PAP grassroots leader in Nee Soon GRC. He is the vice-chairman of the Citizens’ Consultative Committee (CCC) in Chong Pang. On top of that, he is Assistant Treasurer of PAP’s Chong Pang branch (http://pap.chongpang.org/content/branch-organisation) [Link]. Mr Lim is also a recipient of the PBM (Public Service Medal) and BBM (Public Service Star).
His company website says of him (http://www.soilbuild.com/abt_our_ppl.html):
“A strong believer in community service, Mr Lim is the vice-chairman of the Citizens’ Consultative Committee in Chong Pang. His many contributions were recognised in 2009 when he was conferred the Public Service Star.”

For this SERS thing ah, generally how does it work in terms of timeframes?
 
Let's say tomorrow HDB tells me my block is selected for SERS and offers me a replacement nearby, is the replacement usually built or being built already or does the SERS coincide with a new BTO project launched nearby?
 
If there is really a lead time for +-5 years for the new place to be built, do I still get to stay in my current place or do I need to find temporary housing?
 
Basically will they pat me on the head and kick me out?
 
*I ask because my block is almost 40 years old and my only concern is SERS, I'd rather not move.*

During the handover from contractor to HDB, didn't HDB check and certify it is good before the handover?  If properly handover, HDB shd bear the full responsibilities even there is a warrant period.

'Give $40k subsidy' to get parents to join kids in newer towns: Analysts
That is minimum needed to get them to join kids in newer towns: Analysts
PUBLISHED ON JUL 21, 2014 6:42 AM  0 4 0 0
BY RACHEL AU-YONG
 
At least $40,000 in subsidies. Residents, analysts and agents believe that is the minimum needed to entice people living in mature towns to join their grown-up children in newer ones.
 
Even then, the take-up rate is unlikely to be high, they told The Straits Times, because it will be hard to convince parents to uproot themselves from familiar surroundings.
 
To strengthen family bonds, National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan said last week that he would look into providing incentives for parents in mature estates to move out. This would allow children who wish to join their parents in mature estates to have a higher chance of buying the freed-up flats.
 
But even before the details have been rolled out, analysts and residents are lukewarm on the idea. For instance, office manager Lucy Kuah's eldest child lives in Sengkang, but the 59-year-old will not leave her four-room Bukit Merah flat to join him - with or without the incentive.
 
 

 
 

i dun think it is easy to get the old fork to move out of the place they used to, then it is impossible to get the kids to stay near the parents in a matured estate.

only way is to enbloc and totally chase the whole bunch out, which is what they are doing to a certain degree. Very sad. And some are actually left vacant and not even demolished (like a cluster in Teban Garden). Dunno what's their plan?

Likely waiting for tender to pull it down.
Also, sometime while waiting they will rent out to those super low income family.
 
Anyway those enbloc one usually just move down the streets nia.

how much subsidise would they consider to move out to Punggol? imagine the sales proceed from selling the matured estate falt and heavy subsidise for the new one near the children, they would have quite a lot of money left for retirement!

Well, if you're 50's, maybe early 60's still no problem to move. But, many old people would avoid moving at all even if FOC.
 
No joke. It's very bad for him/her psychologically. Seen many up lorry shortly after they moved.
 
Better to have them loiter around their familiar places rather causing too much problem in adjustments. 
 
People may think they are stubborn, but I think sometimes we need to think for these old foggies. Afterall, we will grow old one day.

  Jingye allegedly caused largest dengue cluster in SG
 July 20th, 2014 |  Author: Editorial

Last month (27 Jun), TRE published an article highlighting that new residents moving into HDB BTO flats in Anchorvale Horizon at Seng Kang were complaining about the defects and poor workmanship found in their newly completed flats (‘Complaints against poor workmanship in new HDB flats‘).
It was so bad that the grassroots leaders at Anchorvale Horizon were themselves complaining about the problem too. The grassroots leaders even roped in Seng Kang West MP Lam Pin Min to visit Anchorvale Horizon just to show him how terrible the defects are.
As it turned out, the construction company responsible for the Anchorvale Horizon BTO project was China Jingye Engineering Corporation Limited.
Two weeks ago (5 Jul), Jingye was in the news again. It was reported that Jingye has been told to stop work and clean up its Choa Chu Kang Avenue 1 HDB construction site, another HDB BTO project which it has been awarded. The media reported then that some 35 of its workers were down with dengue fever.
NEA said it will take the Jingye to court after an inspection of the site found four mosquito breeding areas. It was the 4th time the site has been found to be breeding mosquitoes. Jingye has already paid fines of more than $10,000 in total for the 3 previous cases of mosquito breeding.
At the time of reporting 2 weeks ago, about 22 Choa Chu Kang residents in the area were also down with dengue. Now, the number of cases in the area has grown to 391 as of 18 Jul.
MP Zaqy Mohamad was clearly upset over Jingye and called for heavier penalties for construction companies found to have mosquitoes breeding at their sites. He said it was very likely that the outbreak started from the Sunshine Gardens construction site and spread to housing estates.
“It’s quite upsetting, we’ve always had very few cases. It’s disappointing that despite the various measures taken, we had an external party close by cause the outbreak, and they’ve also contributed to a third of the cases,” he said.
Jingye is the main contractor for the Sunshine Gardens, a HDB BTO development. Allegedly, Jingye is said to have caused the largest dengue cluster in Singapore’s history.
NEA said the cluster was formed less than a month on 25 Jun when only 3 of Jingye’s workers came down with dengue.
Mr Zaqy was so upset with Jingye that he wants Jingye to be banned from tendering for HDB projects for at least half a year.
He added that any fines meted out should be scaled to the size of its construction project and the “huge impact” it has had on residents and their health.
“They have to feel the pinch. Look at the number of cases they (Jingye) have sparked in Chua Chu Kang,” he said.
Speaking to the media on Friday (18 Jul), HDB confirmed that it has banned China Jingye from tendering for its contracts – but for three months.
HDB said, “HDB takes a serious view of China Jingye’s improper dengue control management. In view of its second stop-work order last month, we are looking into tougher penalties against it. This could include demerit points, administrative charge and extension of their tender restriction.”
NEA said it will pay particular attention to “high-risk sites such as those with poor track record”, and impose stricter requirements and, where necessary, longer stop-work orders, to break the transmission of dengue.
“I’ve lived here since 1998 and there were never this many cases,” said a resident in the area, Jasmah Abu Bakar, whose daughter is down with dengue. “I noticed these only after the construction started.”
“I’m watching my daughter suffer and a few of my neighbours have also kena (been hit) last month, so I’m more worried now,” she added. “I’m not sure what more we can do at home, other than hoping that we don’t get sick.”
Jingye is a Beijing-headquartered, wholly state-owned company of China. It is a subsidiary of Metallurgical Corporation of China Ltd (MCC), which is listed in Hong Kong and Shanghai [Link].
It was also found that in the various projects in Singapore, Jingye’s work-sites had been issued with Stop Work Orders (SWO) by the Manpower Ministry (MOM) [Link] 5 times since 2008:
Mar 2013
Apr 2013
Jun 2011
Aug 2009
Nov 2008
An SWO is issued by MOM in instances where severe lapses in safety and health conditions cause immediate danger to the persons at work. Failure to comply with SWO is considered an offence [Link].

same size as the old 5 room flats and they wanna squeeze in a 3 gen? what is HDB doing??
 
As for all the complaints of poor worksmanship, i'd think it has been factored into the price already.
 
if want better quality, then the BTO price will be even higher hor!

Some old 5-room flat have 3 bedroom + 1 study room (which is bigger than new flat's 2nd bedroom) with a rather big balcony to boot. Kitchen can put big dining table, washing machine and fridge. 
 
Dunno why must add another toilet? 2 not enough? Collect more toilet bowl fees? OMFG, still collecting toilet bowl fees based on number of bowls!!!
 
I rather they maintain 2 toilets, but configure it such that 1 is common access, another is dual access or better still both common access. Bedroom not supposed to have toilet by right.

U should see how the old 3 gen flat look like. It's essentially a 4 room flat with a 2 room flat attach. That is what I call 3 gen.  
 
The reason why ppl ask for 3 gen is because old ppl and young ppl have different ideal of decorating the house. Having separate living area while still beside on another is the way to solve the problem.

The old 5-room built in 80's have 4 bedrooms (one is a study, but spacious enough to use as bedroom).
 
Then, shrinked..... this 5-room becomes executive........
 
Now, no more build executive liao, they come up with creative idea to build 3G flat..... Same size or even slightly smaller, but cramp too much unnecessary stuff like 2nd kitchen and 3rd toilet.
 
Next???? 4G flat???? = current 4-room but renamed as 4G age dee bee with added..............but shrunkened floor area.

115sqm is quite small for 4 bedroom.
 


This is the typical set up of the new 3G flats?
Kinda tight imo. 110sqm is the size of a standard 5rm during Y2k.

if one is not picky, can buy resale 5-room with 4 bedrooms at some not so popular areas, it's about 39XK+ or make it 400K only + there's no restrictions on application also.

but attached bathroom is convenient esp if parents are elderly and physical movement is compromised.

You look at the diagram, the common toilet is just next to the 2nd toilet built inside that bedroom.

Could be that its intended for elderly's room to be near the main door? So that any knock knock, open the main door only a few steps.
 
The couple and children take the rooms further in. Whats the brand new price for these? ~500k?

U know what I don't like about the new 3 gen?? 
HDB should just be honest and say this is executive apartment. Instead of telling us it's 3 gen.

executive has no condition on parent living together, 3G has.
 
My opinion is, they should just resume the executive, but limited to Singaporeans only, be it new or resale. This way, SIngaporeans who want a bigger family is well-catered for, and those who wish to live with their parents are also catered for, without being too restrictive.

No surprise. Move means lost of familiarity and up lorry very fast. The #1 insecurity about old folks is moving to an unfamiliar place. It is extremely disruptive to their routine.
 
It just shows that sometimes policy makers are out of touch with the masses. $40K "subsidies" just to entice old foggies to move from matured estate to birds don't lay eggs place? I think it's an insult to them. It's not just $$$. If they really need $$$, they could have rent out extra rooms for income which is even better.

Agree. And may I add, mental well being, in some cases the will to live.
Guess this is the new stunt since the last which spoke of old folks home in JB failed. 
Everything points to a business model. Just like when the portfolio cannot justify the office stationed in CBD, = relocate or outsourced elsewhere...

it was just a suggestion that people make just like they also suggest children get priority to move into the matured estate to stay near the parents, do you think that is fair?

nothing is fair. children r given grant for 1st timer to buy n stay near parents for matured estate too.
 
y policy makers promote "birds don't lay eggs" estate. cos those who know will realise that the flats might be cheaper but the COST of living is generally higher compared to matured estate.
 
having stayed in cck bfore, i was actually shocked to find simi chapbarang also more exp than matured estate.
 
having said that, i knew alot of old folks who moved to "eggless estate" only to move back shortly. it is not just bcos of travelling time n cost, they find it is just not cheap. to get around, they hv to rely on feeder bus, LRT, MRT whereas most matured estate just rely on feeder bus, mrt or full-fledged bus to get to town area. n given the fact that tpt cost keeps gg up, most grounded citizens cannot tahan.
