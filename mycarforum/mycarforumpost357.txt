Will you be buying for own stay or for investment? The factors to consider can be quite different for both.

more for own but not really to stay now, more of a weekend home maybe. Not to flip for profit, maybe rent to use the money to upkeep the place. Paying in full so no loans / interest. Likely to lose money?  
 
I have relatives who bought last time but all have sold away. didnt ask why.

 that I am aware will happen. They cant steal the property. can try paying neighbors to look after or rent cheaply and let the tenants look after. Not looking for a luxurious setup. Something very barebone coz it is the property that I finally want.

if that's what you want ... get a condo ... the risk of damaged or unwanted people (ie: drug addicts) squatting in your home (ie: landed) is low
check out Medini (many projects) ... this one is close to 2nd link (less than 10mins) and many projects are co-developed with spore company invested to it ... the quality is good ... surrounding is good ... many ameneties ... etc
the price is "inflated" now but can see see look look and wait for right opportunity
 
since you just want a weekend cosy home .... if you want a 5000sqft double storey semi-D then that's different criteria already

Mine also kenna ripped out...
But since that was spoilt for years, I would like to thank that particular fella whom helped me to remove the compressor unit. 
 
Noticed some of the condos are under-maintained, that's why not really fond of condos. Though you do have security guards at the gate, so less chances of druggies sneaking up to your place when you're not in. Saw "Sky Garden Residences" which is along the E2, not bad, RM500K+ for un-reno'd 3 bdrm ~900sqft apartment. Mont Callista also doesn't look too bad either, Semi-D, 3 storey, 3000+sqft, clubhouse, guarded entrance 24hr .etc which is going for ~1M.
 
Well, to be honest, I'm also thinking of letting go mine.

johor property is not for everyone
 
1. to live in immediately, yes for those who dont come in spore everday and peak period
 
2. weekend home ... no no no ... not worth it. might as well go to many other places during weekend
 
3. investment ... must get the best in term of location or quality and brandname

There is no control on supply, so we are likely to see grief unless Iskandar really attracts a lot of REAL investment (ie. industrial, manufacturing, services and not just property speculation).

Imo, just stay in hotel or resort over the weekend. Desaru is like 50 a night nia..
Got facilities and no need headache over maintenance and thieves carrying away your aircon or 60 inch tv during your absence.
 
Next time I wanna retire there, just rent out Sg Hdb and use the money to rent any house in jb.. probably with spare change, and again, no need headache maintenance and thieves.. no happy, just change another place to rent.
 
And ya.. no need to tie up a couple hundred k in the JB property, which is risky in foreign currency, bank rates and their roti prata policies.

Nearly bought 2 yrs back.. then saw the Iskandar development plan and map..many area still empty. 
 
At the price of that terrace or bungalow, already priced out of reach from many locals..which means they are only able to target foreigners.
 
The education, medical and financial hub is still in it's infancy.. we don't even know the determination from boleh gov to see it through and make it a success.
 
If they will, it may take the next 10 years or more, and again with the large land mass, price may not be able to appreciate much.
And if they don't... good luck..

with swimming pool, gym, shopping, etc
rent is cheaper than buy and even if you have rm$500k it is better to put in FD and use the interest to rent condo

The sold so much land to Chinese developers and they are going to sell to PRC who care more about parking money outside China than yield and part of Iskandar may end up as ghost towns.   Half the development is unoccupied.   Must go in with eyes opened but if more Singaporeans and Singapore based FTs moves there, maybe can get out alive but likely supply will outstrip demand by several folds at the rate they are selling land. Singapore is still a better place for property investment, being an island state.

At that time I checked around, it was already quite high.
New terrace was going at 700k and cluster at 900k.
Boleh gov just implemented minimum 500k foreign purchase.
 
When i released my contacts out, i got a number of offers from preowned.. some offering up to 15% off their original asking price.
Nobody knew when the musical chair is going to stop, we just got cautious and walked away. 
 
Like the situation now.. boleh gov again raised the minimum to 1 mil. Who knows.. risk takers might see the price surge further? But who'll be the last one holding on to the ball?

here is the affordability test
https://sg.news.yahoo.com/afford-home-simple-affordability-test-101534387.html
 

 

If you have problems even paying for 30 percent of the property, you can’t really afford it. 
If the value of your target property far exceeds five times of your annual income, you are either buying an overpriced property or buying a property out of your reach financially.

I think these people know the issue of traveling long distances, but still brace themselves to do it. One reason is the desire to realized the "living in a landed property" dream (cos in SG many can't afford a landed property).

come in once a month or just a few times to run errand
 
but if you die die want to live in a 5000sqft semi-d and cannot afford in spore
then traveling time is something you need to endure and deal with it

some drive porsche and some take public transport
ST also publish articles retirees live in a bungalow in iskandar happily ever after at the cost of a spore 4rm flat

I hope he has already got out as selling is going to be very tough now with the oversupply to come.  Heard don't need to put in much cash till TOP.

you are right ... i think at that time sporean just pay RM$10k tax as foreign buyer and a few % as deposit ... then you are owner liao 
next payment is until TOP ... which is at least 4-5 years or much later based on msia slow speed of development
so ... must flip chop chop curry pop
 
now jialat liao ... entry of barrier is RM$1M .... foreign owner tax is raised ... i think also got minimum hold period to sell
too many rules changed ... cannot follow liao
 
i got check it out too ... RM$800k for a 2BR condo at Puteri Harbour vs a RM$800K terrace house in Horizon Hills ...
at the end ... chicken out after the JB kaki keep scaring me don't catch a falling knife
since 2011 all property in JB and Iskandar already hugely speculated ...
buy prior to 2011 still ok ... if buy before 2008/2009 lagi best

The jam will only get worse as more JBians work in Singapore and live in JB due to high rental in Singapore.  Many used to rent a HDB room in Singapore but moved back to JB after that 1 room cost S$800 per month in recent years, which could get you a multi-room landed (rent) in Johor.  It is difficult to fight with these people who are driven by economics unless you are a retiree. 
Those who know the location of the new MRT/HSR station in JB will be rich.

used to have that thought as well... how come my cousins were different.. then they told me.. own landed means on your own. maintenance stuff like roof leaking, painting, grass porch, cabling ownself settle... 
 
at least in hdb there's always ah gong  
 
another thing hdb, unless u stay in corridor, the only entry is the main door.
landed got many entry points. 防不胜防.
set up all round security cameras 24x7 with alarms linked to the polis (and dunno how long they take to respond)
erect gate and fences.. machiam like kenna jail like that.
 
landed in jb won't be like landed in australia or new zealand.. i stayed there for some time... people in certain places don't even need to close their doors

ya.. that was why eventually we changed our plans... rent if we want to retire there. just pay monthly and don't need bother the rest. we'll live happier.
meantime, save the liquidity for somewhere else

The fact that you need an all round fence, and security + CCTV speaks a lot about the area ! But yet many people still want it, for the sake of landed property living....
 
Ya...houses in Australia n NZ have no fences and gate. You can walk up to their door and visit them anytime.

I got a relative who is under the MM2H, commented recently that the waiting time at Customs is horrendous. While it used to be Bolehland being the bottleneck, he say now is SG side taking a long time. He ever encountered just 6 cars in front of him waited 1 hour to clear 
 
After clearing the customs, it takes only 10 mins to get back. The SG customs side now really taking long time after the recent lapses. But luckily he got more patience since he used to stay in Aus and commute 1 hr to work everyday.
 
1 thing I notice though, most of those MM2H will have 2 cars, 1 SG registered to commute into SG, and another better MY reg car for travel in Bolehland. My relative has a SG reg Nissan Latio, but has also a MY registered Merc.

Notice that most of the suggestions are for new places, what about old worn places with a little larger land areas? What I looking for is price stability n slight appreciation even if not much after five or more years. Meanwhile rent it for cheap just to get people to look after if anyone wants it. What do u guys think? 
 
 I am not flashy n can ride a 1-2k motorcycle or a pickup. 
 
The type of property above is selling a lifestyle, a hot cookie I think.. Developers and the big players make, after that wait for a fool to come and pick up.

This kind now can buy, long time ago can, then can't, then must be with Malaysian, dunno what the rules are, overseas too long, lost touch n now trying to get up to speed. 
 
Must be over 1m then can buy? That kind of house makes me excited, I know it will leak, flood, burst pipe, etc etc, some will even shift their fences to shrink yr property, drug addicts, but it is for long haul so will only do up when needed. Now there got what tax hidden cost?
 
I'm quite sure if it is very near sg, it will appreciate eventually. No fanciful place for me, more for the property.

i understand why johoreans are piss off that property prices skyrocketed because of sporeans
and why msia govt raise the barier to RM$1M min purchase for foreign buyer targeted sporeans
 

 
These are what they called the "low cost" houses. Very clamp inside. Upstairs only 1 bedroom nia....

soon this will be raised to RM$2M because RM$1M is too cheap ... i repeat too CHEAP!
 
 
RM$1M = less than SGD$400K

There're things that can't be measured - your health! Imagine having to commute daily say 3 hrs just to clear customs both ways. How will that affect your health in the long term! For retirees, possible.

Notice that most of the suggestions are for new places, what about old worn places with a little larger land areas? What I looking for is price stability n slight appreciation even if not much after five or more years. Meanwhile rent it for cheap just to get people to look after if anyone wants it. What do u guys think? 
 
 I am not flashy n can ride a 1-2k motorcycle or a pickup. 
 
The type of property above is selling a lifestyle, a hot cookie I think.. Developers and the big players make, after that wait for a fool to come and pick up.

If u r not looking for new, y nvr look at taman mount austin areas?
BTW how come nobody mentioned batam? 
 
those toks abt 2nd home w mistress aside, actually I found the place not bad. Remind me a little bit like Thailand. Outskirt of bkk.

Batam? A joke. Very hard to sell house there, i almost cry ar, sell one year plus then get someone buy moreover at cheap price. If invest property better in Jakarta or Bali. Even in Surabaya I managed to sell mine within 2 weeks

Just get an old unit near the causeway. Rental should be OK as there is a constant demand from the M'sians working in S'pore.
 
Serene Park, Taman Pelangi, Taman Sri Tebrau, Taman Sentosa, Taman Iskandar, Century Garden & Taman Melodies.
 
No need look further than these old Tamans if you intend to have contant flow tenants to occupy your unit.

Investment I dono but I know someone who bought medisuite n studio condo in Philippines. 
 
If for retirement, staying in capital or touristy areas quite dear unless cash rich. But if rich don't even need to retire overseas right.

Local can now buy luxury condo at RM390 psf and foreigners can't buy anything below RM1m, what is going to happen to Singapore buyers of Iskandar properties? 
 
Many bought multiple units @ RM1k psf and can't sell till TOP (mostly next year), they paid 15% down and rest by TOP, I wonder if there is a way to unwind.

MOUNT AUSTIN, JOHOR BAHRU  another gem by ANDAMAN FOR 2015
Away from the madding crowd at the Johor Bahru city center, yet near enough to facilitate easy movement to the city, a mere 15 minutes away from JB Jalan Tebrau, Austin has carved a name for itself, as a much sought-after residential locale, especially among the younger crowd. After Kempas tol, if you are from Kuala Lumpur bound, exit to the left, Austin Heights/ Adda Heights.
Modern living, especially high-rise condominiums and apartments with facilities and security, is particularly popular here, adding color and lustre to the skyline.
Major developers within 10 minutes such as SP Setia, UM Land, EcoWorld, KSL, Mahsing have recognized the great potential that Austin has to offer and have been flocking here, dazzling one and all with its vast array of tantalizing and modernistic homes.
 
The township also comes with numerous facilities and amenities, which cater to every need of its residents. The prestigious Austin Hill Golf & Country Club, stands proudly, right in the middle and nearby is the Austin Heights Water Park opening by end 2015, which is under construction.
Education is rightly emphasized, with the strategically located Austin Heights International School (primary and secondary) and Sunway College right in the middle of the commercial center, a mere five minutes away from our development.
Increased population has also led to increased commercial activities, and the whole township is buzzing, with well-patronized shops and restaurants all around the commercial centers. On the whole, this township is self-contained.
Against the background of the pulsating, booming township, Andaman has decided to spoilt the market, introducing the latest development, right next to the prestigious Austin Hill Golf & Country Club.
 
RM390 PSF Freehold !
 
Fancy living next to a golf course?
 
ARC @ Austin Hills is a JV development between Andaman Group and Majlis Bandaraya Johor Bahru (MBJB). Andaman Group has the distinction of achieving over RM3bil in Gross Property Development Value. Now Andaman Group is set to lead the pace in the affordable properties segment with its latest offering.
 
ARC @ Austin Hills is situated adjoining to Austin Heights Golf & Country Resort and its a mere 15 minutes from the Johor Bahru CIQ. It is surrounded by established residential enclaves such as Taman Daya, Taman Mount Austin, Taman Johor Jaya and Taman Molek.
 
Here Are 3 Things That We Like About The Project:
 
1) Below Market Value
 
Iskandar Malaysia has seen a dizzying increase in property prices for the past few years. This is a refreshing change where Andaman Group not only offers an affordable product for the locals but at below market value.
 
2) Freehold Luxury Serviced Apartment
 
While selling at below market value, ARC @ Austin Hills is offering luxury amenities such as an Olympic size resort swimming pool, garden playground, wellness garden and many more. The apartments has full glass glazing facade with multi-tiered security.
 
3) Golf Course View
 
Location, location, location. Properties near golf courses fetches a premium. ARC @ Austin Hills is situated adjoining to Austin Heights Golf & Country Resort. It offers a spectacular view of the golf course.
 
The selling price of apartments in the surrounding areas are priced at around RM600 psf. Andaman Group will be offering its private preview purchasers an opportunity to purchase below market price. But how low is low? RM550 psf RM500 psf RM450 psf? 
 
We are selling from RM 390 psf

Malaysias Johor Corporation (JCorp) will list an Islamic REIT with MYR900 million (SGD335 million) worth of assets by the third quarter of 2015, state news agency Bernama reported on 28 April citing JCorp chief executive Kamaruzzaman Abu Kasim.
The security, to be known as the Al-Salam Islamic REIT, will start with an initial portfolio of 31 properties including Johor Bahru properties Menara KOMTAR and the JB City Centre shopping mall.
Al-Salam REIT will be an Islamic REIT that will consist of Shariah-compliant commercial, retail,office, and industrial properties, said Kamaruzzaman.
If listed, this will be the second Islamic REIT listed by JCorp after Al-Aqar healthcare REIT which was established in 2006.
According to a timeline revealed by the company, prospectus for the REIT will be released in the June 2015 timeline followed by an initial public offering (IPO) of 580 million units. No details are given on the IPOs indicative pricing or tranche allocations.
Al-Salam REIT is forecast to give a yield of between 6 and 6.3% in its first year, said JCorp.

From what I understand, only those developments launched after the announcement that foreigners can't buy properties below RM1m are affected, not those launched earlier. That means, foreigners can still buy unsold properties that was launced earlier from the developers.

Thanks, not looking to buy.  Just curious how earlier buyers can get out.  I have friends who bought multiple units and with local prices at RM390 psf, I will be sweating profusely if I were them.  Problem is bo tenants, so holding cost will be high.

Malaysias Johor Corporation (JCorp) will list an Islamic REIT with MYR900 million (SGD335 million) worth of assets by the third quarter of 2015, state news agency Bernama reported on 28 April citing JCorp chief executive Kamaruzzaman Abu Kasim.
The security, to be known as the Al-Salam Islamic REIT, will start with an initial portfolio of 31 properties including Johor Bahru properties Menara KOMTAR and the JB City Centre shopping mall.
Al-Salam REIT will be an Islamic REIT that will consist of Shariah-compliant commercial, retail,office, and industrial properties, said Kamaruzzaman.
If listed, this will be the second Islamic REIT listed by JCorp after Al-Aqar healthcare REIT which was established in 2006.
According to a timeline revealed by the company, prospectus for the REIT will be released in the June 2015 timeline followed by an initial public offering (IPO) of 580 million units. No details are given on the IPOs indicative pricing or tranche allocations.
Al-Salam REIT is forecast to give a yield of between 6 and 6.3% in its first year, said JCorp.

6.3%? Wah

Ready to write off the investment a couple of years later. 
 
Many non reit projects also promised 7  % returns for the first few years. What happened after tge over-priced purchase?
 
Listen to T2.
At 7%, you need only 10 years to recoup 100%. So good meh?

http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/10-things-to-look-out-for-when-buying-property-in-malaysia	10 things to look out for when buying property in MalaysiaBY MELISSA CHIMay 03, 2015
A woman walks her dog at Desa Park City. — Pix by Yusof Mat IsaKUALA LUMPUR, May 3 — Everyone keeps saying the time to buy is now but with so many options and different factors in play, how do you make sure that you get the most bang for your buck when shopping for a piece of property?Chris Tan, property lawyer with Chur Associates.
Malay Mail Online spoke to Knight Frank Malaysia managing director Sarkunan Subramaniam, real estate lawyer Chris Tan and senior real estate negotiator at Property Hub, Roy Teo and found out the top 10 factors to look out for when hunting for the right piece of property.
10. Landscaping
A township with well-maintained landscape in Shah Alam.We are not just talking about the landscaping of the landed property or the compound the condominium sits on. It goes without saying that your property must be at least pleasant to look at and well kept.Knight Frank Malaysia managing director Sarkunan Subramaniam.
Sarkunan said the area or neighbourhood where the property is located has to be taken into account as well.
He said if the landscaping of the area is done right, it is a sign the local council is proactive. They will probably be on the ball when it comes to other issues as well.
9. No unplanned vacant land around
He also warned that buyers should be wary of all vacant land in the vicinity of the property, and find out if future construction will affect either road access or the view from your property. If there are no plans for the vacant land yet, he said it is best to stay away.
“Investigate, don’t be caught by surprise after you have moved in,” he said.
8. Gated or guarded community
The guardhouse of a gated community is pictured at Desa Park City, Kepong.Both Teo and Tan said gated communities are in demand. Very.
“It ties back to the fact that people have a fortress mentality. These days, people want to keep the riff raff out… Desa Park City is a good example,” Teo said, referring to the much sought-after enclave in Kepong.
According to Iproperty.com, some of its units (Safa) which were previously priced at RM450,000 are now going for RM1.2 million.
He said previous generations used to aspire to owning bungalows, a house in the middle of a big piece of land.
Today though, he said, those properties are much lesser in demand while he sees a rise in either condominiums or gated communities, which mostly have smaller plots of land, but with bigger build-ups.
7. Near international or high-performing Chinese schools
Teo said having a Chinese school in the neighbourhood adds “huge value” to properties nearby. For example, he said a Chinese school that has relocated to a new development that his company has recently launched in Cyberjaya has been its “biggest selling point.”
He said more non-Chinese families are also looking to move closer to these vernacular schools.
Tan, meanwhile, said that people want to be nearer to schools not only because they want to send their children there, but also to have a good support system among parents.
“If you want to do home schooling, you are better off in a neighbourhood where there are people with the same interest, for example.
“Another example, a popular Chinese school — Lai Meng —  recently moved to Bukit Jalil from KL. If you want your kid to go to Lai Meng for example, you would move closer because you stand a better chance of getting a place in the school,” he said.
6. Who are your neighbours?
Tan, who is a regular speaker at property forums, said the neighbouring township is an important consideration when buying a home.
“Why Cyberjaya can work, it’s because it is next to Putrajaya. Why PJ can work because the neighbour is KL and why Iskandar Malaysia can work because the neighbour is Singapore.
“In that sense, the neighbour does play a part because you want to have the best of both worlds. Perhaps lower expenses on one side and high income on the other side,” he said.
Just as important, find out the racial composition as well as the job backgrounds of your neighbours, he added.
Whether you prefer a culturally mixed neighbourhood, or one that speaks only a particular language, or what kind of jobs your neighbours do, and if they are mostly tenants or owners… you need to do your homework.
5. Population growth 
Tan also said it is important to observe if the population trend in the area is on an upward trend.
“At the end of the day, real estate is meant for human consumption.  So the bigger the population, the higher chance of you getting a better return from your property investment,” he said.
He pointed out that with a bigger population, there will also be better supply services such as hypermarkets, clinics, laundry services and restaurants.
4. Central location or conveniently located 
People jogging at a park in Desa Park City, Kepong.You don’t need to be a rocket scientist to figure out that the more centrally located a piece of property is, the higher in demand it is.
Teo also noticed that the trend has shifted and condominium units attached to malls are back in demand again because people want that sort of convenience.
“When you have strata properties on top of shops, those used to be cheap properties, you can see some in Chow Kit, Bukit Bintang...  people didn’t want to stay in that kind of environment,” he noted.
He said the trend is back and is especially popular among the younger crowd who are looking for smaller units, about 1,000 square feet or studio sizes.
3. Infrastructure/connectivity 
Picture shows a well-maintained road amid beautiful landscaping in Shah Alam.The real estate negotiator said connectivity is extremely important as more people move further away from central locations. People are moving to townships like Cyberjaya and Setia Alam because of the highways that now connect to the city.
Tan noted that most people do not want their homes to be too close to business activities but they do not want it to be too far away either, because they need the supply and services to be close.
People are willing to accept if their workplaces are slightly further away, as long as they are well connected by highways or LRT, MRT stops.
2. Reputable developer
Sarkunan said it is extremely important to buy from developers with a good track record and a practice of delivering on time with quality.
“It also must have a good following and someone who does not price their products to the maximum and allow for reasonable returns,” he said.
1. Location branding
Tan said branding of location can change, driven by “visionary developers” or plans.
“For example Sentul, many years ago, when we talk about Sentul, we have a certain perception about it. YTL changed the perception of that area and for all intents and purposes, Sentul is very arty farty now because of KLPAC, and it’s actually a very nice location because it is very close to the centre of action,” he said, referring to the KL Performing Arts Centre that is along Jalan Ipoh.
The property lawyer said that now would be the best time to buy with the launch of a slew of affordable housing schemes and the fact that home prices will not fall, especially when the country is only five years away from its ambition of becoming a developed nation.

Johor to create special foreigner zones
https://sg.news.yahoo.com/johor-create-special-zones-foreign-buyers-014553724--sector.html
 
The government of Johor plans to unveil new laws which will restrict foreign home buyers to new international zones to protect locals from being priced out of the market.
According to Datuk Abdul Latif Bandi, Johors Minister for Local Government and Housing, details of the plan will be released in June or in August in order to get feedback from the property industry and the public prior to making a final decision.
The move follows complaints that thousands of residential units built by developers are primarily targeted at foreigners. The units, which include three-storey landed homes and luxury condominiums, are often priced way beyond the reach of most Johoreans.
Last year, the Malaysian government set a minimum price threshold of RM1 million for foreign property buyers. Abdul Latif noted that the move only worsened the situation as property developers keen on selling units to foreigners have set RM1 million as the minimum price.
We do not want foreigners to buy all over (Johor), as prices would then go up and the locals cant afford them, he said. We will decide on these areas after engaging with the public and others.
Generally, foreigners are allowed to acquire up to 50 percent of the units at property projects in Iskandar provided the minimum price is RM1 million.
They are prohibited from purchasing units built for low-income Malaysians or for the indigenous bumiputera and Malay communities.
Previously, Abdul Latif said the new zones would allow the government to charge a different property tax rate for foreigners.
The Malaysian government effectively created Iskandars first international zone in 2014 by allowing foreigners to acquire units without any bumiputera quotas within the upcoming Medini township.
The Forest City luxury reclamation project has also shown interest in selling homes to foreign buyers without quota limits.
Meanwhile, Tan Sri Lim Kang Hoo, Deputy Chairman of developer Iskandar Waterfront Holdings, said while he supports local housing zones in order to keep prices affordable for Johoreans, Malaysians should be reminded that Iskandar can only thrive if more foreigners buy property there

30狮城买家新山买公寓
花逾600万元却货不对办
12/01/2016 on 新明日报
By 赖凌杉
 
 

 
蓝图与现实差很大。购屋者指广告宣传的凉亭与现实设计有很大的差别。　（《中国报》）
 
30多名狮城买家申诉，花逾600万元到新山买高级公寓，岂料货不对办，瑕疵处处。
 
引发风波的高级公寓位于新山西北区，分A座及B座两栋，全部597个单位。公寓在2012年开始推介，屋主自去年10月陆续领取公寓钥匙，当中有不少狮城卖家。
 
许多屋主领取钥匙后，发现房子与设计图有落差，而且还有不少陌生人入住，高级公寓一点也不高级，引发不满。

As part of long-term planning, Country Garden is in discussions with the Malaysian government to set up dedicated entry points to Forest City, such as a light rail transit system and a ferry network that will link to Singapore and to the planned high-speed rail (HSR) between Singapore and Malaysia.

Too many properties in Johor.  If you are an investor, it is best not to go in.  I don't think you can make any profit out of it.
 
However, if you want to retire in inexpensive Malaysia, then get one.  For properties in Malaysia, it is best to buy the property when it is about to TOP.  That way, you can inspect the unit and see if it matches what the brochure said, and if the quality is there.  Also, check out the facilities.

Yes, this is a good option too.  No need to upfront put up a big sum of money.  But for long term stay in Malaysia (say 10 years or more), it is better to own one.  Because you don't know if the rental will shoot up in the future.
 
So many units being built how to shoot up?
 
If really shoot up move to another place further north.

What would be your main concern? Say, if you stay in a condo near KSL mall, it should be as good as staying in mix development here, very livable. Again, retirement mode and not traveling in/out on daily basis.

It's all personal but for us the food in the wet markets and supermarkets isn't near the quality of that in Singapore.
 
Although we go over to Malaysia to eat the seafood it is not cooked the way we really like it although it's ok now and again.
 
The property build quality is not too good
 
Dunno about internet speeds or stability.
 
Dunno if can receive Singapore TV channels, no Star hub etc and from what I understand the Malaysia cable TV is no standard.
 
The people are fine and we find them very friendly, no problem there.

the robbers 
This is the problem.
 
My wife unit at East Ledang (TOP recently) had been broken in last weekend. A old old laptop and some cash had been stolen.
 
Called the police and they arrived within 10mins and a group of CID came to our unit after filling a report at the police station.
Security guards and security manager were interviewed and looking at the estate CCTV. I don't expect them to crack the case
due to some renovation work is going on in our neighbour units. They called me up the next day asking for my laptop serial number 
and recommended me to install additional security system in the house.
 
Those ppl who owned property in Malaysia is good to upgrade your locking system and can't depend on the lock installed by the
developer.

Property build also not good but since we rent why care
 
 
Internet speed should be ok ba

being condo or landed, good to install additional security system.
Area just too big for the security guards to patrol and can't depend on built-in estate security system by the developer.
 
moreover, a lot of properties are owned by Singaporeans and weekdays look like ghost town. weekend is a bit more crowded.

You said unit im guessing its apartment? Thats ridiculous if it is cos the guards are useless, if its landed it would be kinda expected i guess.

Majority of the people understand and know investing in property in JB is a no no option. There are obvious reasons and you know it is not possible to compare with Singapore for those obvious reasons.
 
However, why are some still talking about retirement purchase? Why retire need to purchase and park your money there instead of enjoying the money? You rent and move where you feel like living. Today JB, tomorrow Penang, etc Once you buy, you have to look for a retirement job because you cannot sell.

Crime is just a small equation of the challenges there. I am sure in the next few centuries, prices may go up. I just hope Singaporeans don't use Singapore properties as a benchmark for JB properties. It is a totally different story altogether.

Sg cost of living is high.
JB has contributed some relief to Sg high cost in many ways, cheaper shopping and groceries, lower factory operating cost, etc.
The progressive development of JB to be similar to Sg is in Sg interest, similar to HK-Shenzhen relationship.
 
Buying property is JB has it's merits, provided it's at the same price range as the locals buy. Those new developments are actually double the psf of what the locals will consider. The only beneficiaries are the developers.
 
Retiring in JB has its merits, but think carefully. U wanna retire in a big landed and deal with maintenance issues daily? Or be in a spacious condo, or be in a lively landed neighbourhood?
 
Somehow.. when sg ppl buy in JB, the rationale and the end result dun quite seem to tally.
 
Let's not forget.. there are no cycling lanes, no MRT, no buses. Living in a town centre will really be necessary over there.
 
I just think sg should appreciate and understand JB better, and perhaps work more towards a win-win model. Let's not just focus on how JB is lesser than Sg. Shd focus on how can JB be a better place for Sg ppl to live.
 
For example.. Johor news.. their FB updates all in Chinese! Why not have a English version of Johor news. a JB version of Hungrygowhere, etc. Anyone keen to start such an initiative?

I always like to look at properties on countries that is having currency and economic problems. Though I had sold my JB landed property at a good price. I may revisit Malaysia again, if those deals are attractive again. There are ways to make better money than investing in Singapore, where those valuations are still sky high. whether I have to wait 2 years, 5 years or 10 years for an opportunistic buy, I will wait. Patience is key. Own money is at stake. Never follow crowd, like what happen for the last 3 to 5years ago.

I did not faces any problem. Is just like what we did in Singapore. But the transfer was done way before the sudden depreciate at 2.55rate.
I may revisit again. But not commitment. Wait and see approach this time round. I feel that the currency maybe undervalue.

Singapore has its draw with its strong economic fundamentals, very educated workforce and great employment opportunities / rates.
 
If one is resourceful, can do any job in SG and more than survive. Range of housing options avail as well, although admittedly more expensive than most Asian countries to rent or to buy (with the possible exception of HDB).
 
Countries having currency and economic problems appear cheaper but is also underlined by low rentability or prices of properties if employment opportunities do not match their area. But they are viable as an exit path to retire or just to "sit" since funds required are not so extensive.
 
Buy a good and expensive cow, let it graze on grass and get milk daily. Buy a pig and be prepared to feed it for years before it is fat enough to sell. Different strategies for people at different stages of life perhaps.

Though I had made super profit of selling my JB property, that doesn't mean I do not revisit. Iskander is big. Of cause , if you have bought those with many developments nearby , than is an problem at the moment. Be careful of those with integrated township or those with shopping Centres below. What I know of, is those with smaller developments are always safer. There are pockets to look for. It is not the like of Singapore, where asset prices down on one area, the rest of the Island is affected. Buying, property in big countries have to apply different model of understanding.
This is an example of a risky investment, or even for retirement use.

There are plentiful of land in Johore, it will take years for it to be in demand.Why are you suggesting buying for retirement and yet it is not suitable for investment? Not suitable for investment means your money may depreciate over time. Then you sink in money where you may need to use for retirement and get stuck there? Care to explain?

If you use 500,000 ringgit to live 30 yrs. You have 1,400/ month riggit to spend. Not allot but better than you could move that money.

i think the question is why buy knowing that the property aint going to "appreciate"
 
still can let out hdb and rent a condo or small landed in jb as retirement
with the abundance of property to choose from jb ... no worries
 
assuming spore is still doing well compare to jb
the rental in spore definitely enough to cover the rent in jb
no need to sell to move money to jb
 
for those who don't need to sell ... again .. the question is why move money to jb?
ie: throw in $250K or $300k SGD for downpayment a landed and use the rental income in spore to service the loan for jb property
 
then where you stay ?

jb property best of the best is flip before it's constructed or completed
flipping jb property is about "perception" .... more or less hype ...
brochure sibei awesome .... concept sibei tok kong
but reality cannot make it
 
 
but there is still true value to buy jb property for some especially the high end like east ledang
5000 sqft bungalow for MYR3,000,000 .... that's SGD$1M ... can't even buy a 750sqft condo near MRT
to live in a 5000 sqft landed with pool, kids playing at garden and dogs running around ... that's priceless
 
but that's bo logic
 
a. if you are at semi-retirement age, kids already grown up, why need such a big bungalow
b. if you are at early 40+ and kid still young, why stay in jb and kid travel to spore to study every morning?

i see some similarities in the JB ppty vs stock market:
 
Buy penny stocks - low barrier to entry and choices a aplenty
 
Fundamentals - what fundamentals when the supply is the sky with JB sultan selling land and Chinese developers having their own agenda for their own domestic cash stashing buyers.
 
When penny stocks crash - people holding them will console themselves that they are holding long term and for retirement.

Hi,
 
Just to check how much is a 3 bedroom condo in JB now?  Does the min RM1million property purchase price for foreigners still stand?
 
And also I see 1 of the project floor plan doesn't have any built in wardrobe and cabinet like our condo in Singapore.  So does Malaysia property dun include built in furniture?  How about the kitchen?

jus went there on last weekend. concept is not bad but rm1200 to rm1500 psf for a condo is not realistic. you are actually paying for the reclaim land cost. with over rm1.5m for a condo I can buy a landed property at east ledang. moreover, I think most of the buyer at forest city are prc, locals and Singaporean will not pay that kind of price.
 
property at east ledang and leisure farm will be a better buy than forest city which is way over priced.

If it is over RM1m, it makes no sense.
 
My Malaysian colleague bought a landed property in Bukit Indah JB only RM450,000. 
 
If the malaysia govt remove the foreigner RM1m policy, I could consider buying one for holiday house.  RM450k is only SGD150K.  But with the 1m policy, i won't buy.

If it is over RM1m, it makes no sense.
 
My Malaysian colleague bought a landed property in Bukit Indah JB only RM450,000. 
 
If the malaysia govt remove the foreigner RM1m policy, I could consider buying one for holiday house.  RM450k is only SGD150K.  But with the 1m policy, i won't buy.

 
   I would advise you otherwise, many Sillyporean bought condo and landed for investment and self-stay, now condo TOP and no takers, even @RM2500/pm no body wants
 
   My good buddy bought Permas Jaya Landed ( JB ) for self-stay, till now they didn't dare to furnish up the place nicely, even it guarded and gated community, thing can happen if we blink for a few second. As of now it still manageable bt we are here in Sunny Sp.

Whether or not one wish to buy property in Johor, there is no such as good or bad idea. It's all voice down to fitting of ones profile. I had bought one landed property in mid 2000, and rented out till I sold in 2014. Just before, I sold the rental yield was around 14.5%. On top of this, the appreciation of property from RM350 to almost RM2mil. Even with the depreciated current to 2.56 at that time, is still a worthwhile venture.
Back than ppl said I was crazy when I bought in 2000s. But in Today's context, one just have to be careful when buying in JB. Buy small projects with few hundred unit and below. Try to avoid those with integrated or township kindly of gimmicks., that comes with shopping plazas. Once, there are not enough population to sustain the retailers, one day you see ghost shopping plazas. This will have an impact on property price. Also developments with shopping plazas, will tend to have higher crimes than those away.
 Watch out those that are very near to Singapore that are selling RM600k and above. In general, local middle class can only afford btw RM400k - RM600k at maximum.
No one will want to buy from the seller at RM2mil and above. Unless is a big plot of land with great view. Even though, I was merely able to sold mine at less than RM2mil to a businessman previously. Always have in mind on exit strategy whether is buying local or overseas property. JB is not as bad as what the social media has proclaims. Country is big, that is why you see more crimes as compared to Singapore. But if you use numbers represented in percentage, than you view differently.

due to the nature of my job I have the opportunities to live outside Singapore, eg, south Africa - Johannesburg, china - hk - sz, Malaysia - jb. I am not keen in buying overseas property due to currency control, too far away from home... until about 4 years ago, I had decided to purchased 2 pieces of properties in jb for long term investment and own stay.
 
I have a relatively small family therefore will never consider landed property. condo will be my first priority no doubt that landed property has a better appreciation value. just have to keep in mind that buying property in Malaysia must has the ability to hold it for longer term, and has to be extreme careful if you wish to rent out your property aiming for some return. open out your eyes when come to selecting and managing your tenant. you may wish to know that under the Malaysia law, you are not allow to drive out your tenant fail to pay you his or her rental. a court order has to be obtained and this could take you months before you can legally "invite" he or she out of your property.
 
location and developer also play an important role to withhold the property value. perhaps one may consider east ledang and putire harbour area. different developer give you different building, finishing and property management quality, therefore selecting and more established developer can help to maintain your property value.
 
the financial structure in Malaysia is quite ok, and with their natural resources and keep on improving hardware and software capability, I think the challenges ahead of us will not be easy.

Another thing to add on. I sold mine, because Australia properties is more attractive. So re-cycle capital to Australia mainly due to the following factors :
 
1. Johor property price have shot up to the roof, that have not been tested before.
2. Australia had an economy crises
3. Australian dollar suffered
4. Australian properties at certain places when bust to certain extend.(Not referring to central core)

Those who are pessimist against Forrest City, I suggest you drive to the showroom and take a look.
 
You will be darn surprised.

 
were you surprised? Did you invest?
 
I have not seen the location, just viewed some pics online
 
To me, china developer + reclaimed land + over 300K units = bad idea
 
understand target market is chinese buyers & singaporeans (just like dunga bay)
 
i wouldnt want to take part in an enormous washing machine party. just my view, i could be wrong

I visited the showroom too. Wow!!! It's far more impressive than those in Singapore. They have buffer served!!! Buttt.......... Be careful of those with large number of units. Do your homework , like population and demographics of JB.
 
My view of this project is very very scary.

You buy iskandar you will get stuck,  your unit will be incredibly hard to offload to locals who are generally more keen to buy a house that sits on a land and freehold. Your only chance is selling to a foreigner in future but suckers are very hard to find especially when new developments will keep springing up non stop for years to come.  Unless you really love johor, don't buy any property there in the hope of making money now.  Those who bought in the early 2000s are laughing to the bank coz prices were dirt cheap then,  but it is not the case now.  Even the township of mont kiara in the capital KL is seeing terrible sales for new projects and that is supposed to be an upscale neighbourhood. If upmarket mont kiara in the capital of Malaysia is not doing well, i seriously won't expect iskandar which sells plenty of 99yr leasehold airspace to be doing well. Johor may be very close to Singapore,  but in property terms,  it is really a world apart.

Wah! 99 years leasehold is a very bad idea in JB. To summarized things to look for when buy property is JB :
 
1. Avoid Township like developments.
2. Avoid many developments around the area.
3. Look for small developments, where mostly local executives are buying to stay.
4. Price point not more than RM500-600k for apartments with size aleast 900-1k+ sqft. For investment purpose and not often staying there.
5. Avoid developments near malls. Tend to have high crime rate.
6. Look for freehold.
7. Avoid buy landed property, if mainly for investments. Previously before I sold mine, my tenant told me, house break-in twice in a snap of 6 years, even with gated compound.
8. Look for smaller town location, but near city and industrial area. This are where the grow is.
9. Avoid investing those just opposite of Singapore or very near to Singapore. No one will buy from you at RM800 and above. Maybe if one can wait for 20-30 years time.
10. Popular developers tend to sell you high price. There are some mid-tied who are good developers too.
11. Never pay full in cash. This is to hedge against depreciation of currency, that will indirect give ones a discount to the actual price of purchase.
12. Go for flex-loan. This used that many years ago.    
 
In Malaysia, not all locations are invest-able. As long as one have gone through due-diligence, the cost of servicing a property is more worthwhile, than throwing all eggs into the property you stay, whether in Singapore or other places. Likewise, I have purchased a condo in Australia recently for my possible retirement. And planning one more in SIngapore or Johor for opportunistic buy, depending on attractiveness. So I may revisit Malaysia too.

I will avoid johor altogether unless the price revert to the early 2000s type of price. I can't see rental yield prospects or cap gain. Most of those johor investors who made money were those that entered early and have already exited.

hmmm. doesn't make sense leh....  maybe the developer has some "roundabout" to this law. 
 
They got roadshow at City Sq JB, so obviously they are targeting SG buyers.  if the house max price only 900k RM, why bother to sell at City Sq?

just call up leisure farm sales office and was offered rm1.5m (negotiable) for the last 2 unit of semi-d located at bayu water village.
 
maintenance fee is around rm1900 per quarter inclusive of painting sinking fund, which is slightly higher than my condo unit and east ledang.
 
I kind of like the environment and the house size (1700sqf) is just nice for me and my wife (only 2 of us) but mosquito can be a problem.
 
I do not intend to rent out our properties in Malaysia and more for long term investment.

Nowadays, those new developments are underground. So the development is near the golf course. I may look into it. There are some developments does not apply RM1Mil mark. you can check directly with the developer.
Haven't really get start to re-visit after I sold 1 unit in the old part of Leisure Farm in late 2014. But I did hear some developments applies only RM500k mark for international buyer. 
I am not Malaysian. But I can put trusted person's name who is a citizen of Malaysia. If you have relatives, you can do too. But he/she have to be trusted upon. In additional, you have to get lawyer who is strong in property to advice you on how to ensure your exit in the event the person pass-on.
 

according to brochure, it says gated.

Hi,
 
1st of all, is not Dbl Storey Bungalow. Should be Dbl Storey Terrace. (Furthest from NSE)
Yes it's gated and guarded. It's quite Deep in. Beside Seri Austin. Surrounding quite bare yet.
The proposed road leading to Kempas Exchange - NSE dunno when will complete??? Msia… U know la...
For 700-900k, there are better options nearby nearer to NSE exit 255c Bandar Dato Onn. (Daily rush hour Traffic Jam)
 
1) Banda Dato Onn Double storey Terrace from 600+k (Aeon construction underway nearby) Nearest to NSE
2) Setia Eco Cascadia. Price from 700k+ to over $1m. Cluster housing double gated & guarded with pool house/gym. 3rd Nearest NSE
3) Adda Heights(resale). Over $1m can get Semi-D. Terrace pricing lower but foreigner not eligible. 2nd Nearest to NSE
4) Eco World (Summer/Spring). Price from 700k+ (Beautiful European Styling) 4th Nearest NSE
 
You gotta factor in Developer Reputation /  Project Quality / Amenities for the price u pay what u get back.
 
Mature Taman Setia Indah is in the heart of all these developments. Shops/Markets/Eateries galore. (Bus to JB City too)
Future AEON (u/c 2017) will serve these developments well also. Massive construction on-going. Hospital too. (KPJ) u/c 2017.
Short drive 5-10mins is Mt Austin (Tesco/Aeon/Ikea(u/c2017). Mt Austin lots of commercials. FAV for many SG ppl chill.
 
Have Fun!

If you have in mind of buying one, check this reliable sites. The other site, are all about blank listed developers track record. I was using this before I purchase my previous sold unit. Hope it helps.

The danger is when a development have many investors. Who is staying there? Never buy those very close to Singapore or opposite. One will never get a good deal.I prefer further in, where there are less competition.

If you don't intent to rent out, is better to stick to service apartment/ condo. This is generally better bid from family wanting a resort like out of Singapore.
The new leisure farm units are much smaller than the previous ones and quite expensive.
 

just call up leisure farm sales office and was offered rm1.5m (negotiable) for the last 2 unit of semi-d located at bayu water village.
 
maintenance fee is around rm1900 per quarter inclusive of painting sinking fund, which is slightly higher than my condo unit and east ledang.
 
I kind of like the environment and the house size (1700sqf) is just nice for me and my wife (only 2 of us) but mosquito can be a problem.
 
I do not intend to rent out our properties in Malaysia and more for long term investment.
 
any comments on property in leisure farm?

 
Wow! Thanks for the list of developments. I will just see-look-see-look first and hear from them.
 
 

Hi,
 
1st of all, is not Dbl Storey Bungalow. Should be Dbl Storey Terrace. (Furthest from NSE)
Yes it's gated and guarded. It's quite Deep in. Beside Seri Austin. Surrounding quite bare yet.
The proposed road leading to Kempas Exchange - NSE dunno when will complete??? Msia… U know la...
For 700-900k, there are better options nearby nearer to NSE exit 255c Bandar Dato Onn. (Daily rush hour Traffic Jam)
 
1) Banda Dato Onn Double storey Terrace from 600+k (Aeon construction underway nearby) Nearest to NSE
2) Setia Eco Cascadia. Price from 700k+ to over $1m. Cluster housing double gated & guarded with pool house/gym. 3rd Nearest NSE
3) Adda Heights(resale). Over $1m can get Semi-D. Terrace pricing lower but foreigner not eligible. 2nd Nearest to NSE
4) Eco World (Summer/Spring). Price from 700k+ (Beautiful European Styling) 4th Nearest NSE
 
You gotta factor in Developer Reputation /  Project Quality / Amenities for the price u pay what u get back.
 
Mature Taman Setia Indah is in the heart of all these developments. Shops/Markets/Eateries galore. (Bus to JB City too)
Future AEON (u/c 2017) will serve these developments well also. Massive construction on-going. Hospital too. (KPJ) u/c 2017.
Short drive 5-10mins is Mt Austin (Tesco/Aeon/Ikea(u/c2017). Mt Austin lots of commercials. FAV for many SG ppl chill.
 
Have Fun!

The danger is when a development have many investors. Who is staying there? Never buy those very close to Singapore or opposite. One will never get a good deal.
I prefer further in, where there are less competition.

 
changi T1 just before immigration got a giant poster advertising this project. Its really close to 2nd link n for sure some singies will bite coz its the closest of all JB projects. It wont b cheap relative to JB but it may b worth d premium for its location.
 
im gona recce d place w my friends soon.

hmmm. doesn't make sense leh....  maybe the developer has some "roundabout" to this law. 
 
They got roadshow at City Sq JB, so obviously they are targeting SG buyers.  if the house max price only 900k RM, why bother to sell at City Sq?
Many roadshows are targetted at malaysians working in sg, who usually hv higher aspirations n disposable income.  
But my view is.. Better to see the actual completed unit before deciding. Massive choices, and usually the final finishes really sg 80s standards

Looks great! And just across the causeway.
 
But I feel such developments will only have a strong demand if they have dedicated cable car service straight into Singapore.
 
 
 
 


 
this huge development is right across 2nd link & for sale now... how to flip ure JB property when this monster is for sale?

You have no control of your unit and tourism risk. I always wary about those projected yields and mix-development. Malaysia use to have many failed malls. Another thing, the yield stated is only applicable to first few years. And if they upgrade the every 5 years, they may come and ask you for $$$.   You need to be more detail into it.

There is always opportunity to make money in Iskandar (JB) or other part of Malaysia, if one knows the market and environment well. Those who have follow the herd mentality for the last 5 years, whether is Singapore or Malaysia properties, both also Kana.
Singaporeans are more familiar to homeland , so is easier to understand the market. In Malaysia, is a different ball game to invest. Every country have their pros and cons. In Singapore, one pay a high price, high leverage and stress of losing job for the whole life, just for the security sick. Everyone know that and that is why the herds are coming here and fry up those prices artificiality. Whereas those who have lower leverage, have a better night sleep. 
In Malaysia , there are places not that bad as those who seldom goes, but stir-up like they knows much. There are places that can buy, while others are not advisable. Life is not as bad in Malaysia. I do have friends staying there, and life is not as fast as here.
Same goes to Australia. I kind of like there very much. Big countries, have use a different method to look at property investment. Those who use Singapore method to invest overesea, is most likely paying high price, or worst kena carrot headed.

Few years ago when it was still hush hush and not many Sporean seems to be interested with JB property.. We bought a 5+1 (2900sqft) bedder at Danga and it was only RM 320k.. That point when we sign the dotted line, we weren't sure if it will be a good investment or a total failure.
 
As of today, our unit is worth more than double the buying price. 
 
But selling it in the open market is very tough.

Many Malaysian friends told me they will not buy condo in Malaysia for a simple reason... If there is inter-floor leaks and you are the lower floor, good luck to you. There is no mediation nor settlement mechanism available to you. You don't need to eat chicken drumstick because everyday you suck you own thumb

I think there is also no settlement mechanism for inter floor leak in SG. All based on goodwill between upstairs and downstairs to settle the issue.
 
Kaopeh to MCST also no use if the guy upstairs refused to co-operate.

Buy is always can buy one. The issue is whether (i) can stay/live (ii) can make money.Can stay or live. Maybe need to lower expectation of management efficiencies and facilities condition in few yrs time 
Its safe in my opinion at most robbers come u give to them. Don't fight back. Don't let ppl know u go vacant the unit for some time
 
 
But can make money anot its still a question mark. Other than facing capital risk, theres also exchange risk. Within 2 yrs ringgit depreciate 30-40%. Even got capital appreciation, it would be offset by lower exchange value

#283 said is true that you need a strong committee to monitor and push your property management agent to do a good job. your committee also need to have resources to engage a reputable security company to safeguard your property.
 
best is your committee consist of some "ang moh" as they usually has higher expectation and daring enough to "f" the management agent and developer if they did not do a good job.
 
selection of location and developer and holding power is a prerequisite before you decided to sign on the doted line. normally you need to mentally prepare to hold your property for more than 10 years before you may be able to see some return, if you have the right location.

HRS will escalate the rate of factories moving from sin to Malaysia to seek for lower operating cost.
 
Johor and kl will be the potential area for factories to relocate due to it port and airport facility.
 
I work for a mnc and we had moved our major manufacturing facility from sin to jb 4 years ago, and
now working to transfer more activities into jb soon. sin will only become a regional finance center.

In investment, it is always a calculated risk you got to take. Most times, it is not what you think but what majority think. However, if you got extra money to put aside for a long haul, anywhere is always good just which one to pick first.

For those how have bought, and having problem to sell, is mainly one initial decision making was not sound. Many bought in because they hear people that surround them had influence them. So is herd mentality again. Buying at the wrong area, a a wrong time. One may have bought cheap, but cannot sell , due to location and timing. The same goes to Singapore. I have heard people said they had a hard time off loading their properties in Singapore. So at what price you are willing to off loading. That is the question.
 
I have mentioned number of times, about my previous landed property bought at RM360K in early 2000 , and sold for almost RM2mil in 2014. Even accounted the depreciated currency, I still made a handsome gain after converting to SGD. 
 
If those having problem to sell, one should question why they bought in the first place. No exit strategy ? 
 
Just bought a Australian property last year, is the same case applied. Exit strategy and immediate yield. Not hope for appreciation in future. The future is not for us to predict.

It is great that you share your experience here. However, to most would be investors, they read it as huge profit. 
 
More importantly, you should share where is this piece of property you have purchased. I am quite sure it is not one of these mentioned here.

please do not have in mind to make capital gain and rental income if you decided to purchase any property in Malaysia.
location of the property is the most important factor to consider when buying property there.
 
my family goes to Malaysia almost every weekend and public holiday not because of the cheaper patrol, foods or groceries.
we just want to have a less crowded weekend get away with some relaxation. I like the slightly backwards feel of the environment
there which I cannot find it in sin anymore.
 
we bought 2 properties in nusajaya and puteri harbour 4 years ago with one of them is already top and the other will be
end this year or early next year. these properties we bought are more for retirement and family usage.
 
if you are looking for capital gain or rental income, you may want to give Malaysia property a miss. the efficiency of the property
management team and security may not be as efficient compare to sin. therefore, a resident committee play an important role
to ensure the property management agent do a good job and engage a reliable security company to safeguard the property.
other than this, I do not find any issue staying there and perhaps, I find it more relax than back in sin.
 
I have friend retired from his job and bought 8 to 10 properties in nusajaya, leisure farm, horizon hill, medini, setia... for
rental income. maybe his interest is to manage these properties and diy the deco as his hobby. his tenants are mostly ang mo
who work in sin or Malaysia.

   Haven't you read the news, all negative one, who are you going to lease to?
 
   Where are the tenant from ? How much can you get when developer are still trying to sell pigeon hole units?
 
   It does not matter if property if FH or 999 yrs, do your sum and study market flow chart. More than do not mean it's good. One hundred and one buyers regretted buying or worse, after key collection day, only few agent can find tenant as promised by colourful-mouth marketing agents.

I this case on buying into Country Garden development is consider unsound to me. One have to look into these :
 
1. Never buy development with more than 400 - 500 units. This is 6000 to 9000 units!!! OMG
2. Never buy into mixed develop like this.
3. Where are the buyers. Chinese? Most invest, who stay there to sustain the retailers??
4. Chinese development? Be-careful!! Singapore also kena quality issues.
5. what is the critical mass to sustain retailers? What they sell? If they cannot sustain, there will be closure. This in-turn affect the property value above it.
 
So whether one is a Malaysian or foreigner, I would recommend not to touch. Whether Freehold or not, the above point answer for it.
 
 

Buying Malaysia property will be a tough act, even buying haunted pty here is a class act, definitely not in JB,

was being offered a developer buy back semi-d 2 or 3 months ago at bayou water for rm1.25m after discount from rm1.5m, unfortunately, my
family is too small to occupy that unit.

This would help potential buyers.

   Haven't you read the news, all negative one, who are you going to lease to?
 
   Where are the tenant from ? How much can you get when developer are still trying to sell pigeon hole units?
 
   It does not matter if property if FH or 999 yrs, do your sum and study market flow chart. More than do not mean it's good. One hundred and one buyers regretted buying or worse, after key collection day, only few agent can find tenant as promised by colourful-mouth marketing agents. 
No i am not talking about that 
 
Now if i am going to buy resale condo, both freehold and non freehold has the same value, so getting freehold better right? Of course don't expect getting a tenant in johor, if i were to buy maybe for weekend home. More concern about capital appreciation

I would humbly suggest not all malaysian property is bad, the JV of Duo project by both Malaysian and Singapore are good if not better were sold out within weeks, the announcement of HSR which concluded that " the reduction of transport costs for people between large countries may divert economic activities from countries to populous urban districts" summed up the desire for citizens action , as the gateway for a weekends retreat.
 
As most project launches now seems a pale shadow of itself sees lots of banners up for sales and leases unless, with no removal of C.M or tweaking of TDSR, so it is imperative to say no hold bar of any loan quantum to be calibrated, going forward, buying a property in any location, states or countries is a happy occasion, however the how does one draw the line when a country does not have an economic state of expatriates working in MM2H justify the applicant who had been successful or rejected!!
 
One analyst quoted: Compared with Singapore's objective of granting PR status to 30,000 foreigners and citizens to 15,000-25,000 PR every year, based on 2013 Population white paper, the MM2H programme does not look popular.
 
I could have go on . . . simply Iskandar has promised a lot, so far it's too much too many i suppose!!

Those who bought property with many development around, i say good luck. Malaysia is big. Development just opposite of Singapore with more than 500units is a no no. Location also important. There are always opportunities. Those who have no idea of that market, will say don't touch.

I dont wish to quote but this guy told me he thinks more than 70% of the developments in Johore will be vacant. That is how serious it would be. The Chinese are now selling very agressively back home. 
 
I hope not many have put their CPF in there. Extra $ for investment ok.

The problem is we are too used to the situation here whereby tenants are not difficult to come by and properties are well maintained by the mgt committee. Also proper laws protecting landlord and tenants. However, all these are not a given rights out of Singapore.

Properties across the causeway make terrible investments for Singaporeans. The only time you can really prosper from in is when they scrap the bumi policies, change it into a non muslim state and fire every corrupt official.

But not as good as Johor sale.The days of citylights, the sail,  centris etc. no longer exist in the Singapore market unless we witness another financial crisis. Developers have all gotten very smart n greedy,  not like before.  In the past if you remember, new launches were always sold at a discount to resale prices to entice people to buy but now they will tell you new always fetches a premium. Now, buyers do not seem to care about paying high psf to purchase wasted space like huge aircon ledges, pes areas etc. unlike buyers of last time. Times have changed and people desperate to have a piece of the pte pty pie are willing to throw out the fundamentals of finding a good pty. Today,  I would advice people not to jump into a bandwagon just because everyone else is doing it, just remember fools these days come in multitudes and they are no longer in the minority.

JB property is totally new for me, I only start surfing abt it last month. I am not looking for yield nor capital appreciation but jus a weekend place and retirement place in future. Prefer landed so deprive kid with no place to run around in small apartment here can have space to play. Prefer gated guard place with better security. Is it still 1 mio MYR minimum for JB property. In no hurry as buying a property is a big thing. Also agree on over capacity in JB so prices not going to runaway in next few years. So I can take my time to look see. Any recommendations on areas or better project specific u will recommend? Thanks

Its a labour of love that not many can appreciate. Unlikely will hv a maid there to take care. I wld suggest renting for 2yrs to test out the lifestyle before jumping in. The resale narket is weak.. Exit strategy is hard to execute if not used to the maintenance.

For condo i think some allow RM500k and above
 
 
For me i personally prefer bukit indah area, its new township that has malls and good infrastructure, can go through Tuas which is lesser jam as compared to woodland.

Weekend home? Why not go for a nice, expensive, week long holiday, in a 5star resort every year? It could be cheaper as compared to the uncertainties of the prata king Malaysia govt on policies, and, most certainly, security is almost guaranteed as opposed to you owing a weekend house that criminals might be using as their weekday home. 
 
Just my 2 cents.

Yah bro, can't agree more. Silliporeans always forget after some time, that the prata king side (or my bro-in-law likes to say, its cowboy town), we always gets the short end or the stick. Like the stock market CLOB (got clobbered) and property tax of 30K when foreigner sells their property and so on...
 
Why throw away your hard earned money (even if you are filthy rich at that). Put the money to better use than to throw at them over there.
 
My personal opinion only...

Well I hear wat most bros here say, security is always a concern and $ can be put to better use. But seriously, for an average family with kids and not intending to move to countries like Aussie or NZ, maybe JB is a possibility in time to come. I wanna look ahead and plan, maybe not for now but 5 to 10 years down the road, things may change and by then we may hit the 6.9 mio mark in our tiny red dot. Space is a luxury here and we have taken security for granted as a given in a way. True things are not as safe across the borders but maybe its time to learn ourselves and teach our kids to be more 'aware' and not think everywhere else is so 'safe'. There are a lot of Singaporeans and more Johorians that commute between everyday, we will expect it to be more common in time to come...maybe think we drawing a bigger S'pore map, except that this encompass part of JB and is not our land, and as guests to their country

Bro....I like the way you think ahead. Doesn't matter whether we agree on the viewpoint or not, but the fact that you plan ahead as far as JB is concern is great.
 
I know many people discounted off JB, but if one plan for a retirement over there, it is actually not a bad place. When JB first launched the Iskandar project  with Legoland many were skeptical, and then later they see prices appreciated like crazy. Now with HSR in the plan, again people were skeptical, but I have no doubt abt JB captial appreciation potential if one look at it as a long term play.
 
So kudos for planning that far.

bro, no concern if you are not looking at renting yield nor short term capital appreciation.
 
just take it as your weekend house and long term investment (freehold tenure).
 
I bot 1 at nusajaya for rm450psf n 1 at Puteri Harbour for rm600psf. I spend most of my weekend in Malaysia
to take advantage of the lower cost of living and a relatively more relax environment.
 
I have never consider the landed property here due to security concern and it future high maintenance cost.

If you set up a $50k business put it in Indonesia.
 
If you set up a $500k business put it in Malaysia.
 
If you set up a $5m and above business put it in Singapore.
 
Doing business in Indonesia and Malaysia not so sure
 
they will not change the rules and you cannot bring back

landed are cheap especially if you are a Malaysian.
They have land for 1malaysia, which target for lower income.
a corner unit with 2 storeys high, only cost Rm280k + undertable RM20k.
 
why need undertable, for bribe and underwriting which label yourself as a lower income.. 
 
anything is possible in msia..
 
I used to have the same thought of buying a landed in Malaysia..
but looking at their supplies and currency..
I guess eventually it will be a downtrend..
 
their own people also cannot afford to buy a landed..

Beside oversupply and roti prata policies.  once ringgit drops further,  your investment is as good as gone.  if you have bought anything when ringgit was equal to SGD,  it is  3rd in value.

The concept that ur investment value will drop becos MYR drop is relative. Unless u re like some MCFers here full cash then maybe so. If u take a 80% loan mean ur down payment of 20% may drop in value if MYR depreciates, however and hopefully offset with any potential capital gain in future. Also if MYR drops, ur future installments will be cheaper(provided u earn SGD) so a 3kMYR per month maybe 1k SGD now if drops maybe u pay 800 SGD in future or less. Gets cheaper as time goes if it depreciate. if it appreciate then ur value of JB property goes higher. Sounds win win?

RM1M property ... take SGD$266k loan from spore bank ... below 2.0% interest for 20 years
which one win?
sooner or later msia will raise their interest rate with the plunge of myr
RM800k loan with higher interest rate = ho say liao?
sgd/myr exchange rate can keep up with the rise of mortgage interest rate?

can consider mount Austin, pretty decent and lots of good food.
 
landed are cheap especially if you are a Malaysian.
They have land for 1malaysia, which target for lower income.
a corner unit with 2 storeys high, only cost Rm280k + undertable RM20k.
 
why need undertable, for bribe and underwriting which label yourself as a lower income.. 
 
anything is possible in msia..
 
I used to have the same thought of buying a landed in Malaysia..
but looking at their supplies and currency..
I guess eventually it will be a downtrend..
 
their own people also cannot afford to buy a landed..

 
My fren Ah Jib used the 1MDB money to build housing for the lower income
 
and bad people said he stole the money.

If you view MYR property as a retirement place.. then when you enter does not matter.. 
 
 
the problems are
 
1) when and if you must exit for what ever reason.. 
 
2) policy.

I saw a lot of noises here. My take is if you really interested in owning 1 property there, it doesn't matter rm up or down as the market will adjust it self...however if you worry this worry that...then this may not be a right place to you...because you will have sleepless night for the next 20 yrs, what for? Buy singapore Reit stock probably give u more secured return now.

Those thinking of investing in Malaysia just need to look at Mont Kiara. It is supposed to be an upmarket residential district in KL, but owners have difficulty offloading their units despite being freehold and renting them out.

RM1M property ... take RM800k loan from msia bank ... 3.5% interest for 20 years
RM1M property ... take SGD$266k loan from spore bank ... below 2.0% interest for 20 years
which one win?
sooner or later msia will raise their interest rate with the plunge of myr
RM800k loan with higher interest rate = ho say liao?
sgd/myr exchange rate can keep up with the rise of mortgage interest rate?

speaking from experience...actually offloading is not hard..its about pricing...
i flipped a Nusa Jaya property once....
made about 15% based on notional (much more if based on capital vested) before legal fee/stamp duty etc..but their stamp duty is cheap compared to SG!
 
on a side note, always ask a few agents (from different agencies) before you commit as the price is nt transparent vis a vis SG.

Your flip was before or after China developer come?.... I know some manage to flip and make money with country garden during those early lauch stage...

Reconsider decision to match road charge: Malaysian minister to Singapore
Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai denied that Malaysia’s latest road charge, introduced on Nov 1 last year, discriminated against Singapore-registered cars.

SINGAPORE: The Malaysian government has urged Singapore to reconsider its decision to match Malaysia’s RM20 (S$6.50) road charge, media reports said on Friday (Jan 13).
“We have good ties with the Singapore Government. So I hope that they will reconsider,” Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai told reporters after an event at Johor Baru Tiong Hua Association.
Mr Liow denied that Malaysia’s latest road charge, introduced on Nov 1 last year, discriminated against Singapore-registered cars as the fee would be implemented at all border checkpoints in the country.
"To say that there is discrimination against Singapore-registered cars is not true," the New Straits Times quoted him as saying. "We will eventually implement these charges on all foreign-registered cars entering via the Thai border, Kalimantan (Indonesian border) and the East Coast in the peninsula.
"Singapore has been implementing its VEP (Vehicle Entry Permit) fee since 1973. But we (Malaysia) only implemented the road charge of RM20 last November,” he said.
Singapore currently imposes a S$35 VEP fee on foreign-registered cars entering the country, although each vehicle is given 10 free days a year and there are no charges during the weekends. Cars entering Singapore between 5pm and 2am from Monday to Friday are also exempt from VEP.
An average of 20,000 Singapore-registered vehicles enter Malaysia daily via the Causeway and the Second Link.
Singapore’s Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said in Parliament on Monday that the Government will release details soon on how it will match Malaysia’s road charge.
“We have a long-standing policy of matching any levy, tolls or fees charged by Malaysia for using the road links between Singapore and Malaysia,” Mr Khaw said. “This is to ensure that Malaysia takes into consideration our response whenever they raise their tolls or introduce a new levy.”
Malaysia collected about RM13.9 million in road charges from Singapore vehicles between Nov 1, when the new road charge was launched, and Dec 20 last year, he added.

Home » Cars » Malaysia could implement daily VEP fee if Singapore continues with higher road charge – Liow Tiong Lai		Malaysia could implement daily VEP fee if Singapore continues with higher road charge – Liow Tiong Lai	In Cars, Local News / By Gerard Lye /			18 January 2017 10:46 am	/ 70 comments      Transport Minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai said Malaysia may be forced to begin charging a daily Vehicle Entry Permit (VEP) fee of SGD35 (RM109) on foreign vehicles entering the country. This comes following Singapore’s plan to increase its reciprocal road charge (RRC) on foreign-registered cars entering the republic to SGD6.40 (RM20) on February 15, mirroring Malaysia’s newly-implemented road charge. Currently, foreign-registered vehicles entering Singapore are required to pay a road charge, daily VEP fees, toll charges and fixed Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) fees upon departure at either the Tuas or Woodlands Checkpoints. Those who evade or fail to do so can be slapped with a fine or face jail time. Liow told Oriental News Daily that Malaysia’s decision to impose the RM20 road charge on foreign-registered vehicles entering Malaysia in November last year was reasonable as Malaysia did not respond to Singapore’s implementation of the VEP fee in 1973. “If they (Singapore) insist on it (imposing the RRC) and do not reconsider their decision, we may be forced to implement the VEP policy practised by Singapore,” Liow was quoted as saying. He added that the higher RRC will burden Malaysians but acknowledged that the move could be a method of controlling the number of foreign-registered cars driving into the republic

More arrests expected in Johor, says MACC
 

KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 27 — The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) is expected to carry out more arrests as they intensify their probe into a multi-million ringgit housing scandal in Johor. 
MACC Deputy Chief Commissioner (Operations) Datuk Azam Baki said investigators were in the midst of obtaining several documents from the suspects’ offices.
“MACC is investigating the claims of fraudulent activities pertaining to the transfer of Bumiputera housing status to non-Bumiputera,” he said.
The six suspects, including the eldest son of Johor Housing and Local Government Committee chairman Datuk Abd Latif Bandi, was detained on Friday and were believed to have been involved in corruption and embezzlement of housing ownership status in Johor.
Sources said the suspects were involved in the transfer of Bumiputera housing status to non-Bumiputera activities since 2013, and it involved several housing developers in Johor.
The activities conducted by the suspects enabled those involved to benefit greatly while those who were eligible to purchase Bumiputera homes suffered the consequences as they could not afford to buy new houses.
“The change in housing status means the price of the house would sky-rocket from the original purchase price,” the source said.
Explaining further, he said the developers would switch the housing status by concealing the 30 per cent quota given to Bumiputera buyers in a list with their own employees who have the Bumiputra status. It was understood that the developers would then make an application to the state government to switch the housing status from Bumi to non-Bumi under the pretence that the homes were unable to be sold.
However, when asked by would-be Bumiputera buyers, the developers would claim that Bumiputera status houses have been sold out.
The developers would be fined and the fine would be deposited into a special chest for the purpose of public amenities development in the housing estate, but it was highly likely the bulk of the fine was embezzled by the suspects. 
Johor Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Mohamed Khaled Nordin said the detention of six men for alleged corruption by MACC was based on information and reports received by the agency.
“MACC does not detain people for no reason,” he told Bernama after launching the School Bus Fare Subsidy programme in Pasir Gudang, yesterday.
Asked whether the state government would conduct an inquiry on the matter, he said MACC was investigating it.

bumi land means cannot be sold to others... topping up will likely mean 'kopi'... which can be never-ending.

http://www.themalaymailonline.com/money/article/report-forest-city-developer-suspends-china-sales-to-halt-capital-outflow
 
KUALA LUMPUR, March 10 — Beijing's clampdown on capital outflows may have forced Forest City's developer to close down all its showrooms in mainland China to stop sales to local buyers, the South Morning China Post reported.
The Hong Kong paper said a spokesman from Country Garden confirmed that all its showrooms have been closed down after its reporter found the company's flagship showroom in Shanghai locked and closed during a visit yesterday.
However, the spokesman said the close down was for renovation and not due to Beijing's capital policy.
“A Country Garden spokesman confirmed with the Post that it had shut all the sales centres in mainland China for renovation, but said the move had nothing to do with China’s capital controls.
“The spokesman estimated there were dozens of Country Garden sales centres in China, without giving the exact number,” the paper said.
The closedown came amid the Chinese government's ban on its citizens from converting yuan into other currencies for overseas property purchases. The ban order was issued in January.
In the same month, the general manager of Country Garden’s finance centre, Wu Bijun, told SCMP that its projects in Malaysia had been affected by the government’s crackdown on capital outflows.
At the same time the paper quoted Raymond Cheng, a Hong Kong-based property analyst at CIMB Securities, as saying that Beijing's tightening measures on capital flows will severely affect sales in China.
“The project doesn’t have much appeal to Malaysians while China’s crackdown on capital outflows will certainly slow its sales in China,” he said.
But Cheng was also quoted saying that there would be insufficient demand from Chinese buyers to keep sales going anyway.
The Forest City project covers a 14 square kilometres of land on four artificial islands in Johor, Malaysia.
SCMP reported that the project is one of the best-known overseas properties among mainland Chinese residents due to Country Garden’s widespread promotion, including heavy advertising on state-owned television.
The development had been successful in attracting Chinese buyers by offering affordable prices and access to Malaysia’s visa programme for long-term stays, the paper added.
90 per cent of Forest City buyers were reported to be from China.

I think if your purpose for investment it's better to buy a property in Bintan island because cheaper, only 40 minutes from Johor by ferry, last week when I was visiting trikora beach  there are few condotel projects will start in the next few months one of them is avara resort, next week I am planning to visit that beach again.

UPDATED: 7:49 AM, AUGUST 12, 2016

 

Singapore and Malaysia signed a Memorandum of Understanding on July 19 to build the High Speed Rail (HSR) linking Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, a long-awaited update on the project that also revealed a more reasonable completion target of 2026.
In my most recent book, Weathering a Property Downturn, I had hazarded a guess that the earliest date for the HSR to begin operations would be the year 2025. Inter-city and international railway projects are never simple and deadlines get postponed all the time. Acquiring land across four Malaysian states, resettling affected families and businesses and, most importantly, the raising of funds for the entire project, will require a few more years, especially if local issues and politics disrupt the timeline.

ADVERTISING
 
inRead invented by Teads

 
The project has been repeatedly hailed by both governments as a “game changer” for our economies. Investment advisers are already spouting the economic benefits of the HSR and recommending various types of investments all over Peninsular Malaysia. However, to think that the HSR will change the game for the whole of Peninsular Malaysia, outside of Kuala Lumpur, we have to look deeper.
Dr Qin Yu, an assistant professor with the National University of Singapore, authored a paper titled No County Left Behind? The distributional impact of High-Speed Rail Upgrades in China, in which she concluded that “the reduction of transport costs for people between large cities may divert economic activities from counties to populous urban districts”. The paper, accepted and awaiting publication by the Journal of Economic Geography, also revealed that the major cities that host the terminus stations fare better, while the counties along the route of the high-speed rail saw 3 to 5 per cent declines in annual gross domestic product arising from a reduction of 9 to 11 per cent in fixed asset investment.
If the findings from this study are applicable to the Singapore-Malaysia HSR, we could expect to see the economies of Singapore and Kuala Lumpur expand while the economies around the six intermediate stations shrink: Putrajaya, Seremban, Ayer Keroh, Muar, Batu Pahat and Nusajaya. For the cities and towns such as Port Dickson, Tampin and Kluang, which are bypassed, the economic outlook might even be more dire.
Depending on the price of the HSR tickets, some residents of Kuala Lumpur, Seremban and Malacca may find it ideal to work in Singapore, earning their incomes in Singapore dollars, while returning home every evening to be with their families. This could lead to a further brain drain or skills drain from various Malaysian cities to Singapore.
MALAYSIA MY SECOND HOME (MM2H) PROGRAMME
The MM2H programme started in 2002 and 29,814 applicants have been approved since. The current total number of participants could be lower, as there may be double counting in cases of renewals and there could also be dropouts along the way.
In the first four months of this year, approvals were given to 424 applicants, meaning that on an annualised basis we might expect a total of about 1,300 approved applicants this year, or a drop of about 40 per cent from 2015, which itself saw a decline of 28 per cent from 2014.
Compared with Singapore’s objectives of granting Permanent Residency status to 30,000 foreigners and citizenship status to about 15,000 to 25,000 Permanent Residents every year, based on the 2013 Population White Paper, the MM2H programme does not look popular.
Among the approved MM2H applicants are Singaporeans who have applied for the MM2H status to enjoy the privilege of buying cars at a discount for their relatives who reside in Malaysia. Each approved MM2H person is entitled to purchase “one new motor car made or assembled in Malaysia” with an exemption from excise duties, thus saving tens of thousands of ringgit for their families.
The cumulative 29,814 applicants added a mere 0.1 per cent to the 30 million population of Malaysia. Even if all the approved participants choose to reside in Iskandar, they will only fill up 10 per cent of the 300,000 residential units launched in the past five years. I am inclined to conclude that the 13-year-old MM2H programme has negligible impact on both the economy and demand for property.
ISKANDAR’S PROMISE AND LETDOWN
Pundits continue to sing praises about the growth potential of Iskandar. In a drive around Nusajaya last month, we observed that the pace of construction seemed slow, with several projects that were fully sold years ago still under construction. One large billboard proclaimed “Akan Datang” and “Coming Soon” above a construction site hoarding for a luxury condominium project that failed to launch after the 2013 peak of the Iskandar hype. Needless to say, construction has not started.
As for the completed condominiums, banners displaying “For Sale” and “For Rent” are commonplace. A casual count estimates 10 per cent of the apartments are furnished with curtains. A medical centre that was launched with much fanfare was opened for business in late 2015. As of July, no more than a quarter of the clinics in the medical centre have been taken up by specialist doctors.
Some developers in Iskandar have dropped prices to move leftover apartments, adding downward pressure on valuations. Buyers who took deferred payment plans and paid down less than 10 per cent of purchase prices are walking away from their investments. Some investors have gone further, requesting developers to refund their downpayments by citing the inability to secure mortgages as the banks have tightened up on loans to foreigners.
The situation with commercial and industrial properties is similar. While millions of square feet of commercial and industrial space are completed and waiting for tenants, several high-profile projects have never broken ground.
We have scant information about the value of investments into Iskandar, in particular, how much went into businesses and factories that will create jobs. Of the much quoted RM202 billion (S$67.8 billion) invested into Iskandar between 2006 and March this year, how much was for the reclamation of land and for the purchase of land by developers? How much was due to the sales of strata-titled apartments, SOHOs, offices and industrial space by the same developers? What about the value of investments that have been withdrawn?
Malaysia held promise until over-development and overhyped promises propelled property valuations into the stratosphere, especially when Iskandar prices matched those in prime Kuala Lumpur districts. Investments from Singapore are unlikely to improve given the slump in trade, manufacturing and financial services in the Republic while corporate default risks are rising.
I am eager to be the first to upgrade my call on Malaysian properties to a “Buy”. However, against an uncertain political climate and economic outlook in the country, which could depress real estate valuations or further weaken the ringgit versus the Singapore dollar, my call on Malaysian real estate is an “Avoid” for now.

Toll War: Stung by Malaysia, Singapore slaps extra $6.40 entry charge on foreign vehicles

All foreign-registered vehicles entering Singapore from the Tuas or Woodlands Checkpoints will have to pay a reciprocal road charge (RRC) of S$6.40 (RM20) per entry from 15 February, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced on Monday.  
The RRC will be levied on top of the existing taxes, including Vehicle Entry Permit (VEP), toll charges and fixed Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) fees. The vehicles are expected to pay all these charges before leaving the checkpoints.
 
 
 
"The RRC mirrors Malaysia's road charge of RM20 (S$6.40) per entry for non-Malaysia registered cars entering Johor, which was implemented on Nov 1, 2016," said LTA, according to The Channel News Asia. The authority also said that a composition sum of S$50 will be imposed on motorists who evade the RRC. If the accused motorist fails to pay the sum, he could be fined up to S$1,000 or sent to jail for three months maximum.

Signboards have been put up at the checkpoints to remind motorists to pay the applicable charges. They can either pay it by their Autopass card or CashCard at the immigration booths, the LTA said. .
"This is to ensure that Malaysia takes into consideration our response whenever they raise their tolls or introduce a new levy," Singapore's Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said, reminding people that the country's government has an old policy of matching any tax or tolls charged by Malaysia at the land checkpoints.

By Kevin Lim | SINGAPORESingapore's first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, warned against the risks in helping to develop an economic zone in neighboring Malaysia, adding that the wealthy city-state he helped build might not be around in 100 years if it did not pick good leaders.
"I am absolutely sure that if Singapore gets a dumb government, we are done for," Lee, who turns 90 next month, wrote in "One Man's View of the World", a book launched on Tuesday.
Losing none of the candour that made him one of Asia's most influential leaders, Lee had sharp words for some of Singapore's neighbors, in particular Malaysia, from which Singapore split in 1965, amid ethnic tension between its Malay majority and the Chinese minority.
Lee also spoke about risks involved in the Iskandar economic zone that Malaysia is developing just north of Singapore, which has attracted large investments from the city-state.
Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Lee's eldest son, and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak have both promoted Iskandar, which many believe can complement Singapore, just as Shenzhen has helped Hong Kong overcome its space constraints.
"This is an economic field of co-operation in which, you must remember, we are putting investments on Malaysian soil," Lee said. "And at the stroke of a pen they can take it over."
Lee appeared alert but frail at the launch event, requiring assistance to stand and walk about. He did not take questions, but said his 400-page book recounted "90 years of various experiences" and included hard facts and hard truths.
at a stroke of a pen, singaporeans needs to pay rm $20 . 
use your brains to think what might happens if they want you to pay more, what can you do about it
To buy a Malaysian property. I rather buy all the rolex t2 has to sell.I think i make more monies from buying t2 rolex and you know what is the most important thingI dont need to pay rm 20 dollars each time i wear my rolex watches

Country Garden pledges refund for Forest City buyers caught in Beijing’s crackdown on capital outflows 
Country Garden Holdings, whose Forest City project in Malaysia is the biggest overseas project by a Chinese property developer, said it will refund money to mainland investors caught up in Beijing’s escalating crackdown on capital outflows.
 
The move is the latest consequence arising from Beijing’s tighter policy on capital controls, with most Chinese developers engaged in selling overseas properties now forced to shift their focus from mainland buyers to other countries.
 
“We have completely stopped our sales in [mainland] China,” Zhu Jianmin, vice-president of Country Garden, told the South China Morning Post last month in Hong Kong, referring to its flagship Malaysian housing project in Johor, which launched sales in 2015.
 
In March, the property giant closed all its Forest City sales centres on the mainland, a move first reported by the Post, after stricter government scrutiny on capital leaving China.
 
For buyers who made down payments on properties at Forest City but are no longer able to transfer the rest of the payment out of China, “they can cancel the transaction and there is no need to pay a forfeit fee”, Zhu said.
 
Zhu emphasised that the project always abided by the rules and regulations of both Malaysia and China and that only about 5 per cent of buyers were considering withdrawing their purchase.
 
.....
 
As a fresh measure, Country Garden has since this year required all mainland Chinese buyers to make payments in Hong Kong or Singapore, rather than on the mainland, to bypass Beijing’s capital controls.

I don't think it will be full refund. The developer probably knows is fruitless to push for payment.
 
So it make sense to let them break the contract and then put the unit back to the market to resell to SINGAPOREANS.
 
I am hoping to pick up a unit at RM100K. High floor; Sea View. Will my dream comes thru?

Sea view?? More like petrol chemical refinery view like those in Punggol. On top of that, whole place ghost town nobody staying, retail stores and restaurants also move out due to low traffic. Next thing you know, construction work stops for other units. See you still want to stay at the high floor or not.

So far, all the news from my circle of friends who bought properties there are negative news.
 
The only process that is fairly trouble-free is the buying process. Notice I use "fairly trouble free"!

The problem if them, I believe were bought during the last few years. Sad and sorry to say, herd of sheep followed. If one, have done homework and leg work properly, in fact is to his/her advantage. The problem was, most congregated in bigger developments that is more 300 units , plus couple of development around. And worst still, getting someone to rent out the units. Of course horror stories lah. Developer never run away, you are already consider lucky. Many doesn't know have Malaysian properties works. They merely based on Singapore methods. In Malaysia, location is only one part of the story. 
 
If one could have done it properly, and by taking bank loans instead that could have save him $$$ with the depreciated RM + interest. If those paid in cash, sorry for them. Never buy units that is more than RM600k. Local cannot never afford beyond that numbers. So there are ways to invest the JB. One who knows well the location and talk to the locals staying around there, and do a discounted cashflow.The yield is still good compare to SG property just merely btw 1.5 - 3%. Know your hedging game, and one will do fine in JB.
 
I have also heard of people who bought UK properties, now facing difficulties. Never follow the herds. Any overseas investments, one have to do legwork and due-diligence. Government policy risk and increase of nationalistic sentiment in various countries.

http://www.tnp.sg/news/world/fallout-set-spread-after-bandar-malaysia-deal-aborted
 
KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's decision to scrap the sale of a 60 per cent stake in its signature Bandar Malaysia project to a Malaysia-China consortium came as a rude shock, with the fallout set to spread from the 197-ha township earmarked to house a terminus for the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High-Speed Rail to the rest of the economy.
 
Optimism over the perceived impact of massive Chinese deals - RM144 billion (S$46.6 billion) of which was unveiled in November after Prime Minister Najib Razak's visit to Beijing - was deflated overnight.
The immediate effect was palpable on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange, which closed 0.8 per cent lower yesterday, with smaller firms suffering the brunt of the selldown.
Iskandar Waterfront Holdings (IWH), the 60-per-cent partner in the consortium with China Railway Engineering Corp (CREC), voluntarily suspended its listed arm Iskandar Waterfront City (IWC) in expectation of dumping by investors.
Both IWH and IWC are controlled by tycoon Lim Kang Hoo.
Shares of construction firm Ekovest - which is also controlled by Tan Sri Lim but was not suspended yesterday - fell 18 per cent.

According to UOB-Kay Hian, IWH's plan to take over IWC's listing status and hopes that it would inject its stake in the RM150 billion Bandar Malaysia project sparked the two-month long bull run in the market. But that deal is now in doubt.
"Expect significant overcast on broad sentiment, given that the IWC-IWH merger marked the start of the market exuberance and run-up on small-mid caps, and implications on perceived political uncertainty, 'murkiness' of government deals, and dampened China FDI investment theme," the investment bank's head of research Vincent Khoo said.
TRX City, a Ministry of Finance company, said on Wednesday that the IWC-CREC deal has been aborted because the consortium failed to pay the agreed RM7.41 billion despite several extensions to the initial June 2016 deadline.
100 PER CENT OWNERSHIP
TRX City said it now owns 100 per cent of the township development and is looking for a new master developer.
The joint venture partners said late on Wednesday that they are preparing a legal challenge against TRX City.
Given that the Bandar Malaysia deal is seen to have been brokered at a government-to-government level, the cancellation now trains the spotlight on the hundreds of billions promised by China in other projects across Malaysia.
Capital controls imposed by Beijing have already rocked Forest City, an ambitious development across four reclaimed islands in the Strait of Johor.
Financial executives are expecting other China-led projects in Malaysia, including those by state-owned firms like CREC, to hit similar roadblocks.
Moreover, unlike the Bandar Malaysia project, many other deals with China have not even seen binding legal agreements.
Among them are the RM43 billion Melaka Gateway port and partnership deals between e-commerce giant Alibaba and Malaysian firms that include a RM5 billion digital hub in Bandar Malaysia.

And now the ship sinked.  I do believed some Singaporeans could have invested around it way before, when the rumor spread sometime back .

TRX City, a Ministry of Finance company, said on Wednesday that the IWC-CREC deal has been aborted because the consortium failed to pay the agreed RM7.41 billion despite several extensions to the initial June 2016 deadline.
100 PER CENT OWNERSHIP
TRX City said it now owns 100 per cent of the township development and is looking for a new master developer.
The joint venture partners said late on Wednesday that they are preparing a legal challenge against TRX City.
Given that the Bandar Malaysia deal is seen to have been brokered at a government-to-government level, the cancellation now trains the spotlight on the hundreds of billions promised by China in other projects across Malaysia.
Capital controls imposed by Beijing have already rocked Forest City, an ambitious development across four reclaimed islands in the Strait of Johor.
Financial executives are expecting other China-led projects in Malaysia, including those by state-owned firms like CREC, to hit similar roadblocks.
Moreover, unlike the Bandar Malaysia project, many other deals with China have not even seen binding legal agreements.
Among them are the RM43 billion Melaka Gateway port and partnership deals between e-commerce giant Alibaba and Malaysian firms that include a RM5 billion digital hub in Bandar Malaysia.

There goes my dream of owning a property in Malaysia, however it seems to me that China has seen a fair share of what is happening in Bolehland, either thy do see the significant advantage over Singapore, or that thy realised there is a hidden agenda behind it, no one has the courage to pullout such a mega project despite heavy deposit, guess thy have done their due diligence.

You see, I just mentioned, before this happens. But is nothing new in Malaysia.  This is risk one have to bear in mind especially those MEGA ones, like township la, what xxxship lah. And now the ship sinked.  I do believed some Singaporeans could have invested around it way before, when the rumor spread sometime back . 
 
Wow bro how did you know this will happen?
 
I am very impressed.
 
You have contact inside IWH, IWC, CREC
 
or just guess only like this Nicolai?

By Kevin Lim | SINGAPORE
Singapore's first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, warned against the risks in helping to develop an economic zone in neighboring Malaysia, adding that the wealthy city-state he helped build might not be around in 100 years if it did not pick good leaders.
"I am absolutely sure that if Singapore gets a dumb government, we are done for," Lee, who turns 90 next month, wrote in "One Man's View of the World", a book launched on Tuesday.
Losing none of the candour that made him one of Asia's most influential leaders, Lee had sharp words for some of Singapore's neighbors, in particular Malaysia, from which Singapore split in 1965, amid ethnic tension between its Malay majority and the Chinese minority.
Lee also spoke about risks involved in the Iskandar economic zone that Malaysia is developing just north of Singapore, which has attracted large investments from the city-state.
Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Lee's eldest son, and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak have both promoted Iskandar, which many believe can complement Singapore, just as Shenzhen has helped Hong Kong overcome its space constraints.
"This is an economic field of co-operation in which, you must remember, we are putting investments on Malaysian soil," Lee said. "And at the stroke of a pen they can take it over."
Lee appeared alert but frail at the launch event, requiring assistance to stand and walk about. He did not take questions, but said his 400-page book recounted "90 years of various experiences" and included hard facts and hard truths.

at a stroke of a pen, singaporeans needs to pay rm $20 .

Iskandar Malaysia Property Investments – 5 Reasons Why They’re a Bad Idea

A few months back, I entertained the thought of buying a property in Iskandar Malaysia, either as a home for myself, or as a rental property. The relatively weak Malaysian Ringgit makes it a very enticing proposition, but while personal factors (like location of friends, lack of personal transport and poor internet infrastructure) ruled out my using the property as a home, I also quickly realized that it’s also a very bad idea to buy one as an investment.
Now, I don’t pretend to be an expert in property investmenting, but what I do have however, are insights as the son of a real estate agent, and my penchant for (overly?) anal-analytical thinking.
So why is investing in Properties in Iskandar Malaysia currently a bad idea? Here are some of my reasons:
 
1. Limits on Foreigners
There are 2 parts to this.
The 1st one, which is arguably superficial, is that in every project, certain units are always reserved for the local Malay populace. There are informally called ‘Bumi Units’, named after the ‘Bumiputera‘, the policy. You can read more about it here.
In practice, you’ll find that some of the best units will not be available for purchase because you’re not a local Malay. An annoyance for those buying for yourselves, though probably not as big of an issue if you’re planning to rent the place (There are of course loopholes to get around the problem, but we’ll focus on the ‘official’ stuff only, yea?).
The most important thing though, is that foreigners are only allowed to buy property above a certain limit. It was RM500,000, and as of 3rd March’14, it has been raised to RM1,000,000.
Understandably, this is to prevent rapid rise in prices due to over-speculation, which is a good thing for the locals. As an investor however, this will be a problem for your exit strategy, which we’ll talk about later.
 
2. Are Businesses Moving In? Who are your Tenants?
Iskandar Malaysia is being sold as a holistic nirvana where anybody can work, play, and live a balanced life.
Be that as it may, there’s 1 fundamental a lot of new investors miss when they’re considering an investment here; Are businesses moving in?
Think about it. In any new town, businesses must set up shop first before the people (employees of these businesses) move in. I’m not sure that’s the case with this region.
The next time you bring yourself and/or your family along to Johor for your shopping and seafood, keep your eyes open and pay attention to the commercial spaces. Are the shops doing well? Are their customers mostly locals or weekender Singaporeans? Where are the offices, warehouses and other non-retail spaces? Are they filled or mostly empty? etc.
This is important information because you need to figure out who’s going to rent your property and if there’s demand. From what I see so far, demand from local business staff is extremely low.
The other side of this argument is that because of the increasing cost of living in Singapore, more people will starting living cross-causeway livelihoods, working in Singapore while staying in Johor. A valid point, I concede, but honestly, when will the demand start to rise?
How many are willing to spend the extra time, at least twice a day, 5 times a week, enduring traffic jams going to and fro work via the check points? Until Singapore and Malaysia stop bickering and solve this fundamental logistical issue can large scale cross-causeway livelihoods become a reality. This, and the recent measures to (finally) increase supply of houses in Singapore, means that most people will still opt to stay here.
So, who’s going to rent your property?
 
3. Competition Against Other Investors
I shall attempt to figure out why you’re thinking of investing in Iskandar Malaysia with the help of my crystal ball… let’s see now…. mmmm……. ahhh… I see…:
1. You’re new to property investing
2. Malaysia is still ‘familiar’ territory compared to, say, the Philippines or Vietnam
3. Properties in Malaysia are much cheaper than those in Singapore (2.5x cheaper sial!)
4. No Money Down (It seems like the Malaysian government is cracking down on this loophole though)
…. close?
Hey, don’t take it personally. Knowing yourself is half the battle won yes? I’m in the same boat as you =)
With that done… do you see a problem?
We’ve already established that rental demand isn’t exactly hot in that area right now, yes? And yet, it seems like housing in Iskandar is (or was?) selling quite well, and I suspect, to those with the same mindset as you and me.
So, not only do we have questionable demand, but we also seem to have an oversupply of new wannabe ‘investors’ trying to rent as well, which means there will be a large supply of rental properties in the market, and a large supple would mean lower rentals and a lower return on investment, isn’t it?

Mmmm… Singapore Dollars looking Delicious

4. Cheap Investment?
One of my pet peeves is that the word ‘cheap’ is often misused. It’s often used to denote ‘low priced’ when it should mean ‘low for its price’ instead. Let’s put it this way, buying a $1,000,000 sports car that costs $2,000,000 to make is ‘cheap’, while $7.90 for the same nail clipper that can be bought for $2 at a pasar malam (night market) is called ‘expensive’. Price ≠ Actual Value.
Anyway…
A similar problem plagues the mindset of the wannabe investors who are exploring the possibility of investing in Iskandarian properties; They (or We, I should say) feel that these projects are ‘cheap’ because they’re ‘cheaper’ than properties in Singapore.
In my opinion, Iskandar Malaysia is, especially their residential projects, in effect, like Batam Island, in that they’re made to cater to Singaporean cash cows who are willing to be milked. In other words, most of it is hype, with inflated prices and an excess of fake demand.
 
5. Exit Strategy?
Let’s say, for whatever reason, the time has come for you to sell this property of yours. Now, before we talk about making or losing money, let’s talk about the 2 primary factors that will effect your ability to do so:
The RM1,000,000 lower purchase limit on foreigners, and the fact that most properties launched are priced between RM500,000 and RM1,000,000.
Oops.
You have to remember that these projects are not made to be affordable for the locals; They’re there to maximize profits from foreigners (read: Singaporeans) with cash to spare. So, unless the government lowers the limit or there’s a miracle spike in property prices, the limit effectively eliminates all foreigners as potential buyers for your property.
How can you sell.. when there are no buyers?
 
Conclusion
1. Limits on foreigners that limits choices.
2. A practically non-existent rental market.
3. Competing against a large pool of ‘investors’ for a small pool of tenants.
4. Bad value for money.
5. Effectively, no way out of this investment.
Honestly, all one needs to do is to ask some simple questions and do a little research to know that investing in Iskandar Malaysian properties is, at best, a questionable move to make. There are too many things working against you and expecting any of those factors to change is almost akin to gambling, hoping for a good card to appear.
Investing may be a game, but it’s a game you want to win by making informed choices.
There’s a word for taking chances and hoping for the best: Gambling.
At the moment, in my humble opinion, the local government and the property developers made a killing while the ultimate losers are those who bought units before the limit increased to RM1,000,000. These people are stuck with a property that’s extremely difficult sell or rent to break even, much less make a profit out of.
Here’s the thing though; There IS a potential for that place. After all, with the cost of living in Singapore on the rise and its government’s penchant for taking short-cuts to solve its population problem, an increasing number of people will consider staying around Iskandar Malaysia as a permanent compromise between convenience and lower cost of living.
That being said, I believe that the potential will only be realised in the relatively far future, and things will only get much worst before it becomes a viable investment option.
I hope this ‘layman’s’ take on the subject has given some insight into the topic. Remember to share this post, especially with those who are considering a purchase in the area.

Is this  gross or net (after deducting the Agents comm, taxes, repairs and what not yet to come) and making trips up there and liasing with contractors whom will surely sort of 'ketuk" you 'cos they know you are a Singaporean and want things done fast fast as we cannot donkey up and down everytime; or let the Agents do all this and quietly just pay the bills and for a managing fee altogether; and I dont know if in Malaysia they have so called GIRO system and if have then again you have to open a local RM account too to facilitate it

In practice, you’ll find that some of the best units will not be available for purchase because you’re not a local Malay. An annoyance for those buying for yourselves, though probably not as big of an issue if you’re planning to rent the place (There are of course loopholes to get around the problem, but we’ll focus on the ‘official’ stuff only, yea?).
The most important thing though, is that foreigners are only allowed to buy property above a certain limit. It was RM500,000, and as of 3rd March’14, it has been raised to RM1,000,000.
Understandably, this is to prevent rapid rise in prices due to over-speculation, which is a good thing for the locals. As an investor however, this will be a problem for your exit strategy, which we’ll talk about later.
 
2. Are Businesses Moving In? Who are your Tenants?
Iskandar Malaysia is being sold as a holistic nirvana where anybody can work, play, and live a balanced life.
Be that as it may, there’s 1 fundamental a lot of new investors miss when they’re considering an investment here; Are businesses moving in?
Think about it. In any new town, businesses must set up shop first before the people (employees of these businesses) move in. I’m not sure that’s the case with this region.
The next time you bring yourself and/or your family along to Johor for your shopping and seafood, keep your eyes open and pay attention to the commercial spaces. Are the shops doing well? Are their customers mostly locals or weekender Singaporeans? Where are the offices, warehouses and other non-retail spaces? Are they filled or mostly empty? etc.
This is important information because you need to figure out who’s going to rent your property and if there’s demand. From what I see so far, demand from local business staff is extremely low.
The other side of this argument is that because of the increasing cost of living in Singapore, more people will starting living cross-causeway livelihoods, working in Singapore while staying in Johor. A valid point, I concede, but honestly, when will the demand start to rise?
How many are willing to spend the extra time, at least twice a day, 5 times a week, enduring traffic jams going to and fro work via the check points? Until Singapore and Malaysia stop bickering and solve this fundamental logistical issue can large scale cross-causeway livelihoods become a reality. This, and the recent measures to (finally) increase supply of houses in Singapore, means that most people will still opt to stay here.
So, who’s going to rent your property?
 
3. Competition Against Other Investors
I shall attempt to figure out why you’re thinking of investing in Iskandar Malaysia with the help of my crystal ball… let’s see now…. mmmm……. ahhh… I see…:
1. You’re new to property investing2. Malaysia is still ‘familiar’ territory compared to, say, the Philippines or Vietnam3. Properties in Malaysia are much cheaper than those in Singapore (2.5x cheaper sial!)4. No Money Down (It seems like the Malaysian government is cracking down on this loophole though)
…. close?
Hey, don’t take it personally. Knowing yourself is half the battle won yes? I’m in the same boat as you =)
With that done… do you see a problem?
We’ve already established that rental demand isn’t exactly hot in that area right now, yes? And yet, it seems like housing in Iskandar is (or was?) selling quite well, and I suspect, to those with the same mindset as you and me.
So, not only do we have questionable demand, but we also seem to have an oversupply of new wannabe ‘investors’ trying to rent as well, which means there will be a large supply of rental properties in the market, and a large supple would mean lower rentals and a lower return on investment, isn’t it?

Mmmm… Singapore Dollars looking Delicious

4. Cheap Investment?
One of my pet peeves is that the word ‘cheap’ is often misused. It’s often used to denote ‘low priced’ when it should mean ‘low for its price’ instead. Let’s put it this way, buying a $1,000,000 sports car that costs $2,000,000 to make is ‘cheap’, while $7.90 for the same nail clipper that can be bought for $2 at a pasar malam (night market) is called ‘expensive’. Price ≠ Actual Value.
Anyway…
A similar problem plagues the mindset of the wannabe investors who are exploring the possibility of investing in Iskandarian properties; They (or We, I should say) feel that these projects are ‘cheap’ because they’re ‘cheaper’ than properties in Singapore.
In my opinion, Iskandar Malaysia is, especially their residential projects, in effect, like Batam Island, in that they’re made to cater to Singaporean cash cows who are willing to be milked. In other words, most of it is hype, with inflated prices and an excess of fake demand.
 
5. Exit Strategy?
Let’s say, for whatever reason, the time has come for you to sell this property of yours. Now, before we talk about making or losing money, let’s talk about the 2 primary factors that will effect your ability to do so:
The RM1,000,000 lower purchase limit on foreigners, and the fact that most properties launched are priced between RM500,000 and RM1,000,000.
Oops.
You have to remember that these projects are not made to be affordable for the locals; They’re there to maximize profits from foreigners (read: Singaporeans) with cash to spare. So, unless the government lowers the limit or there’s a miracle spike in property prices, the limit effectively eliminates all foreigners as potential buyers for your property.
How can you sell.. when there are no buyers?
 
Conclusion
1. Limits on foreigners that limits choices.2. A practically non-existent rental market.3. Competing against a large pool of ‘investors’ for a small pool of tenants.4. Bad value for money.5. Effectively, no way out of this investment.
Honestly, all one needs to do is to ask some simple questions and do a little research to know that investing in Iskandar Malaysian properties is, at best, a questionable move to make. There are too many things working against you and expecting any of those factors to change is almost akin to gambling, hoping for a good card to appear.
Investing may be a game, but it’s a game you want to win by making informed choices.
There’s a word for taking chances and hoping for the best: Gambling.
At the moment, in my humble opinion, the local government and the property developers made a killing while the ultimate losers are those who bought units before the limit increased to RM1,000,000. These people are stuck with a property that’s extremely difficult sell or rent to break even, much less make a profit out of.
Here’s the thing though; There IS a potential for that place. After all, with the cost of living in Singapore on the rise and its government’s penchant for taking short-cuts to solve its population problem, an increasing number of people will consider staying around Iskandar Malaysia as a permanent compromise between convenience and lower cost of living.
That being said, I believe that the potential will only be realised in the relatively far future, and things will only get much worst before it becomes a viable investment option.
I hope this ‘layman’s’ take on the subject has given some insight into the topic. Remember to share this post, especially with those who are considering a purchase in the area.
Do check out another take on the same topic @ Dr Wealth: Iskandar Malaysia is Only Going One Way – Down. Research is always important, yes?

Maria Ozawa is in Malaysia ...and her fans are going crazy
 

 
KUALA LUMPUR: Former adult movie star Maria Ozawa stunned her Malaysians fans yesterday when she posted pictures of her strolling about in Kuala Lumpur.
 
She posted four photos of her Kuala Lumpur trip on her Instagram account, starting with a “Hello Kuala Lumpur” post, announcing her arrival in the city, yesterday.+
 
The 31-year-old, who is of Japanese-Canadian parentage, also posted a photo of her at a bar with her recently-announced boyfriend, Filipino actor and chef Jose Sarasola.
 
Famously known as “Miyabi”, Ozawa's photos received a flood of comments from her fans.
 
These ranged from welcoming her to the city and offering suggestion on other places she could visit.
 
Other fans, meanwhile, launched a discussion on how they can track her down in order to snap to a picture with her.
 
Ozawa has gained a legion of fans since embarking on her adult film career in 2005. She has since bade goodbye to the adult film industry and has begun appearing in mainstream films in Taiwan, Indonesia and the Philippines.

Is this  gross or net (after deducting the Agents comm, taxes, repairs and what not yet to come) and making trips up there and liasing with contractors whom will surely sort of 'ketuk" you 'cos they know you are a Singaporean and want things done fast fast as we cannot donkey up and down everytime; or let the Agents do all this and quietly just pay the bills and for a managing fee altogether; and I dont know if in Malaysia they have so called GIRO system and if have then again you have to open a local RM account too to facilitate it

 Works to about 1% agak agak  , put money in local SGP bank better yleld  (FD for 12 months ) and no need headaches of currency depreciation and donkey work and stress  

 
and got to compete with thousands of other house owners trying to rent out the same houses...... we will see many houses on "lelong" for rent
 
In my humble conclusion on MY houses. Only buy it for own retirement. Don't even think of any capital appreciation or rental yield

You see, I just mentioned, before this happens. But is nothing new in Malaysia.  This is risk one have to bear in mind especially those MEGA ones, like township la, what xxxship lah. And now the ship sinked.  I do believed some Singaporeans could have invested around it way before, when the rumor spread sometime back . 
Yah, for me i have never have confidence in investment accross the causeway. Malaysia have plenty of land, not many expats, income so low.. who is going to rent?

The be fair to Malaysian properties, I had made 3.5x money when I sold a property in JB, in 2014, after selling Singapore property in 2011. Whereas, Singapore I made only 2.1x. Than bought one in Australia in 2015 end , after the property bust, there.
 
Coming from middle ground, every country have it's pros and cons. Depending on what one needs. Even today, Malaysia also have it's pros. Because worst situation is priced near. Whereas Singapore, the prices are still inflated, due to it's stable rating. Therefore, one have to pay premium to this market and accept low yields.
 
If everyone says, Malaysian properties are no good. It is priced for the worst. There are gems around. One just have to know the place well. My factories are in JB, and goes in often. In fact the place have change alot. Those who seldom interact with the locals, and just head from news in Singapore, may lost opportunities.

In simple terms KL is mature and growth is organic; All expats are there, embassies, international crowd, though bubble burst will have repercussions all over but the % fall in JB will be bigger , something similar here like Freehold vs Leasehold    
 
JB is trying to be one but will still be a long way, though some overseas factories have set up

Industrial Land/Commercial Land/ shops  is a completely different ball game from residential properties; I think you also have to set up a registered company there to buy industrial property (I could be wrong here; as my friend wanted to buy a warehouse in JB but somehow was told he needed to register a Company or something like that; dont know if its really true)

You have nailed on it. That is exactly, I am look for. The bigger fall if JB vs KL. The widely the fall, the highly chances of getting better deals.At the moment, I am looking around Senai area, where that are current and upcoming factories setup up there. The last few years, I have been employing executives and managers from KL upwards. They have to get accommodations near there. Besides , is near the airport. Good connection and current infrastructural already there and operating.  Don't even border the High Speed Rail (HSR), whether it comes though or not. I normally write-off this hype.
 
JB properties opposite Singapore maybe at risk, as they are too many MEGA projects. You only have 3.5mil population in the entire Johor. Most of this population, already have a place to stay in.

Property market in Singapore is too controlled by the government. This is mainly to limit large swings, which had happen over the last few decades. Today the population of smarter and well informed. Opportunities are slim. Unless one willing to accept yields that are less than 3.5%. Therefore making big in Singapore is going to tough moving forward.
My current Northern Sydney property is making around 6 - 6.8%, after tax and management fees. This was attributed by lower bank rates ,depreciated dollar and not as congested as Southern Sydney. Where most properties were developed around the city area.

By the same token Aud Bonds are paying about 3.5 -4.5%  yield currently (decent good ones with good ratings)  if one does not want the hassle of flying down, doing documentation, govt tax stuff, property upkeep/maintainence....etc....... and the problems encountered whilst trying to off load the property; though Aussie properties have appreciated somewhat in the last 3-4 years quite a lot due to everything to do with the Chinese influx andothers moving in too;
 
But maybe go back about 5-6 years back when the Aud currency was like once nearly over 20% stronger than SGD, now its like almost on par by 3-4% only

when you have deep pockets, investing in JB for long projection is possible. The questions are how long and with the same investment, you may get faster and better yield elsewhere. Good luck and you really need to open eyes big big before you plunge in.

On four man-made Malaysian islands, Chinese developer Country Garden is building a huge new city. In one of the ads, the company bills it as “a dream paradise for all mankind.”
 
Called Forest City, the $100 billion metropolis will be able to accommodate 700,000 people. That’s about 20,000 more than the current population of Washington, DC — and it will have a density greater than Manhattan.
 
A new video taken by a drone offers a look at Forest City’s construction, which began in early 2016:
 
As you can see, a few apartment buildings and park spaces have already sprouted up, and some other towers are in progress. When Forest City is complete by 2040, it will have office buildings, parks, a transit network, hotels, restaurants, shops, schools, and 250,000 housing units. 
 
While the mega-development sounds promising, several experts worry it could become a ghost city, failing to attract the residents it needs to become a thriving metropolis. Since the 1970s, Chinese developers have built some-500 ghost cities in China. Forest City is expected to be the largest overseas project by a Chinese developer.
 
In April, nearly 60 home buyers, 70% of which are Chinese, cancelled their leases in Forest City, reportedly due to China’s increasing efforts to curb money from leaving the country. 
 
As Business Insider previously reported, the supply of Forest City housing is outpacing demand. In 2016, Country Garden sold just 15,000 of the 250,000 Forest City residential units, totaling about $2.6 billion in sales, according to Yu Runze, the company’s chief strategy officer.
 
There aren’t many people walking around in the above video, but then again, Forest City is largely still under construction.

One do not need to fly over often. All one needs, is trusted middle mam to do that. Since the last purchase, I have only fly twice. Almost all transactions via internet. Is how savvy one managing. That is one main reason, why many still prefer local properties. To correct your 2-4years ago, actually that is the bust period in Australia. I will never buy, it is during the boom period.    
 
In Singapore , it is hardly one make 3.5% after all deductibles including loans, if one keep a close watch on operating expense related to the property. Many may not be even aware they are either breakeven or lost. Of cause , during the boom, one just need to anyhow a dart. Sure hit.  
 
Your remarks : But maybe go back about 5-6 years back when the Aud currency was like once nearly over 20% stronger than SGD, now its like almost on par by 3-4% only
 
My opinion : That is the beauty of current at work. You don't repatriate when it is not in favor. You send cash in when AUD falls. You repatriate, when AUD appreciates. Therefore, potentially is more the 6%. See that?
 
 

By the same token Aud Bonds are paying about 3.5 -4.5%  yield currently (decent good ones with good ratings)  if one does not want the hassle of flying down, doing documentation, govt tax stuff, property upkeep/maintainence....etc....... and the problems encountered whilst trying to off load the property; though Aussie properties have appreciated somewhat in the last 3-4 years quite a lot due to everything to do with the Chinese influx andothers moving in too;
 
But maybe go back about 5-6 years back when the Aud currency was like once nearly over 20% stronger than SGD, now its like almost on par by 3-4% only  

 
KL condo market weakest is depending the period of purchase. Many have when in like herds of sheep, the last few years. Now of course suffer. Worst off, to those who used cash to purchase, today is in sorry stated.

Nope. I differ. You don't need to predict for currency move. I can't do that either. One buy a property for 10 or more years. Over a that period many things can happen. Future is not for us to predict or pure luck. All rates are transparent. Many are still home base. But it is not easy in Singapore to make that big swing. In Singapore,I just have to wait for a repeat crises, like one happen in Australia last 2- 3 years, where developers did some degree of fire sales.
That's what I did many years ago on my JB property. During the early 2000, no one border to touch. And people commented, crazy. 
 
Recently, mass local properties experience only a slight downward trend, after a rocket spike over the last 7 - 8 years. So I still wait, and not mind to miss the train. If that yield I would rather stick to my liquid portfolio that gives me 6 - 8%, and 40% cash. That gives me flexibility to take on crises opportunities. Rather than local ill-liquid property that gives only 3% or less, after going through all trouble. I believe it will come, but strange enough, almost every crises comes when many get caught off guarded. That's where those liquid comes in handy. Yes, you may say equities too will go down as well. Again that depends at what price is purchase and years experience counts. I can liquidate fast enough.  I would not leak further from here.

Normally, I never trust this sort of selling by the Chinese. I am very weary about such selling. Many got mixed up with 2 countries' government collaboration and individual as a individual investor. On government to government level is different from individual level, in terms of investments.

Iskandar Malaysia Property Investments – 5 Reasons Why They’re a Bad Idea

Image Source: http://www.iskandarmalaysia.com.my/our-development-plan
A few months back, I entertained the thought of buying a property in Iskandar Malaysia, either as a home for myself, or as a rental property. The relatively weak Malaysian Ringgit makes it a very enticing proposition, but while personal factors (like location of friends, lack of personal transport and poor internet infrastructure) ruled out my using the property as a home, I also quickly realized that it’s also a very bad idea to buy one as an investment.
Now, I don’t pretend to be an expert in property investmenting, but what I do have however, are insights as the son of a real estate agent, and my penchant for (overly?) anal-analytical thinking.
So why is investing in Properties in Iskandar Malaysia currently a bad idea? Here are some of my reasons:
 
1. Limits on Foreigners
There are 2 parts to this.
The 1st one, which is arguably superficial, is that in every project, certain units are always reserved for the local Malay populace. There are informally called ‘Bumi Units’, named after the ‘Bumiputera‘, the policy. You can read more about it here.
In practice, you’ll find that some of the best units will not be available for purchase because you’re not a local Malay. An annoyance for those buying for yourselves, though probably not as big of an issue if you’re planning to rent the place (There are of course loopholes to get around the problem, but we’ll focus on the ‘official’ stuff only, yea?).
The most important thing though, is that foreigners are only allowed to buy property above a certain limit. It was RM500,000, and as of 3rd March’14, it has been raised to RM1,000,000.
Understandably, this is to prevent rapid rise in prices due to over-speculation, which is a good thing for the locals. As an investor however, this will be a problem for your exit strategy, which we’ll talk about later.
 
2. Are Businesses Moving In? Who are your Tenants?
Iskandar Malaysia is being sold as a holistic nirvana where anybody can work, play, and live a balanced life.
Be that as it may, there’s 1 fundamental a lot of new investors miss when they’re considering an investment here; Are businesses moving in?
Think about it. In any new town, businesses must set up shop first before the people (employees of these businesses) move in. I’m not sure that’s the case with this region.
The next time you bring yourself and/or your family along to Johor for your shopping and seafood, keep your eyes open and pay attention to the commercial spaces. Are the shops doing well? Are their customers mostly locals or weekender Singaporeans? Where are the offices, warehouses and other non-retail spaces? Are they filled or mostly empty? etc.
This is important information because you need to figure out who’s going to rent your property and if there’s demand. From what I see so far, demand from local business staff is extremely low.
The other side of this argument is that because of the increasing cost of living in Singapore, more people will starting living cross-causeway livelihoods, working in Singapore while staying in Johor. A valid point, I concede, but honestly, when will the demand start to rise?
How many are willing to spend the extra time, at least twice a day, 5 times a week, enduring traffic jams going to and fro work via the check points? Until Singapore and Malaysia stop bickering and solve this fundamental logistical issue can large scale cross-causeway livelihoods become a reality. This, and the recent measures to (finally) increase supply of houses in Singapore, means that most people will still opt to stay here.
So, who’s going to rent your property?
 
3. Competition Against Other Investors
I shall attempt to figure out why you’re thinking of investing in Iskandar Malaysia with the help of my crystal ball… let’s see now…. mmmm……. ahhh… I see…:
1. You’re new to property investing
2. Malaysia is still ‘familiar’ territory compared to, say, the Philippines or Vietnam
3. Properties in Malaysia are much cheaper than those in Singapore (2.5x cheaper sial!)
4. No Money Down (It seems like the Malaysian government is cracking down on this loophole though)
…. close?
Hey, don’t take it personally. Knowing yourself is half the battle won yes? I’m in the same boat as you =)
With that done… do you see a problem?
We’ve already established that rental demand isn’t exactly hot in that area right now, yes? And yet, it seems like housing in Iskandar is (or was?) selling quite well, and I suspect, to those with the same mindset as you and me.
So, not only do we have questionable demand, but we also seem to have an oversupply of new wannabe ‘investors’ trying to rent as well, which means there will be a large supply of rental properties in the market, and a large supple would mean lower rentals and a lower return on investment, isn’t it?

Mmmm… Singapore Dollars looking Delicious
4. Cheap Investment?
One of my pet peeves is that the word ‘cheap’ is often misused. It’s often used to denote ‘low priced’ when it should mean ‘low for its price’ instead. Let’s put it this way, buying a $1,000,000 sports car that costs $2,000,000 to make is ‘cheap’, while $7.90 for the same nail clipper that can be bought for $2 at a pasar malam (night market) is called ‘expensive’. Price ≠ Actual Value.
Anyway…
A similar problem plagues the mindset of the wannabe investors who are exploring the possibility of investing in Iskandarian properties; They (or We, I should say) feel that these projects are ‘cheap’ because they’re ‘cheaper’ than properties in Singapore.
In my opinion, Iskandar Malaysia is, especially their residential projects, in effect, like Batam Island, in that they’re made to cater to Singaporean cash cows who are willing to be milked. In other words, most of it is hype, with inflated prices and an excess of fake demand.
 
5. Exit Strategy?
Let’s say, for whatever reason, the time has come for you to sell this property of yours. Now, before we talk about making or losing money, let’s talk about the 2 primary factors that will effect your ability to do so:
The RM1,000,000 lower purchase limit on foreigners, and the fact that most properties launched are priced between RM500,000 and RM1,000,000.
Oops.
You have to remember that these projects are not made to be affordable for the locals; They’re there to maximize profits from foreigners (read: Singaporeans) with cash to spare. So, unless the government lowers the limit or there’s a miracle spike in property prices, the limit effectively eliminates all foreigners as potential buyers for your property.
How can you sell.. when there are no buyers?
 
Conclusion
1. Limits on foreigners that limits choices.
2. A practically non-existent rental market.
3. Competing against a large pool of ‘investors’ for a small pool of tenants.
4. Bad value for money.
5. Effectively, no way out of this investment.
Honestly, all one needs to do is to ask some simple questions and do a little research to know that investing in Iskandar Malaysian properties is, at best, a questionable move to make. There are too many things working against you and expecting any of those factors to change is almost akin to gambling, hoping for a good card to appear.
Investing may be a game, but it’s a game you want to win by making informed choices.
There’s a word for taking chances and hoping for the best: Gambling.
At the moment, in my humble opinion, the local government and the property developers made a killing while the ultimate losers are those who bought units before the limit increased to RM1,000,000. These people are stuck with a property that’s extremely difficult sell or rent to break even, much less make a profit out of.
Here’s the thing though; There IS a potential for that place. After all, with the cost of living in Singapore on the rise and its government’s penchant for taking short-cuts to solve its population problem, an increasing number of people will consider staying around Iskandar Malaysia as a permanent compromise between convenience and lower cost of living.
That being said, I believe that the potential will only be realised in the relatively far future, and things will only get much worst before it becomes a viable investment option.
I hope this ‘layman’s’ take on the subject has given some insight into the topic. Remember to share this post, especially with those who are considering a purchase in the area.
Do check out another take on the same topic @ Dr Wealth: Iskandar Malaysia is Only Going One Way – Down. Research is always important, yes?

This reasons is only partially applicable to investor who is a foreigner. As mentioned, anything above RM500k is not wise to purchase. But if you investor via trusted close relative who is a Malaysian, than it make sense. That is what I am looking into.  When almost everyone is pessimistic, one will able to easily find great value. 
I have started investing out of Singapore, because of value. Moving forward, it is not easy to achieve good returns in Singapore. The premiums is high, and everyone is so competitive in terms of market acknowledge. With high premiums one paid for and after all deductibles, one may achieve 2 -3.5% annualized. Why taking all troubles to invest a private property here, there one can park money in almost risk-free CPF SA/OA.? On top of this, one can sleep well without worrying market/technology disruption.
 
We are heading to gig economy where there are more shorter term jobs, sharing economy. The days of stable job is getting harder to come-by. Things are changing faster than anyone is aware of. As a developed economy, we are seeing more automation/robots replacing people. This is already a sign of business not as usual. More AI automation are encroaching into higher educated professionals space. Therefore, lesser jobs means less consumer(Human) spending.With less spending, means you do not need more retail. 
 
But not forgetting the high-end properties in Singapore well do well. To them, may not be for investments. It is a play ground for them to enjoy the security aspects.
 
Developing countries, like Malaysia which is not stable create opportunities. I bought into an Australian property a year+ ago, because the developer was disparate off-loading it. It was due to the after crash in oil prices 3 years ago. This is the first time I bought into a developed country.

These people are stuck with a property that’s extremely difficult sell or rent to break even, much less make a profit out of.Here’s the thing though; There IS a potential for that place. After all, with the cost of living in Singapore on the rise and its government’s penchant for taking short-cuts to solve its population problem, an increasing number of people will consider staying around Iskandar Malaysia as a permanent compromise between convenience and lower cost of living.That being said, I believe that the potential will only be realised in the relatively far future, and things will only get much worst before it becomes a viable investment option.I hope this ‘layman’s’ take on the subject has given some insight into the topic.

Ultimately, on e have to do ground work there to understand the implications and exit strategies. That is why many still stick to Singapore as a easy way out to invest. If one call it as an investment, mean one is looking for much higher returns compare to our CPF SA. If one invest below that returns, what the point. Just because it is in Singapore. If our realize, we are heading toward what Japan is of today. Is a nice country with 4 seasons. For 3 decades, population have not been able to grow and we see greying day by day. Do you think this greying population will buy more properties ? 
 
Back to Singapore. Yes, many said land scare, Don't worry. It will fill up in no time. Price will escalate sooner or later. Before one decides , understand the what is happening outside of us. These points are well known to public. I just summarized here :
 
1. Recently, China seem to be alienating us.
2. OBOR created by the Chinese, is going to economically affecting us in many fronts.
3. The change of the world Order, US policies is unclear and retreating on US, China is stepping up to fill the void.
4. Our Port use to be a strategic point of business follow between the East and West. But things are starting to happen from the North(China and northern SEA).
5. China include HSR development, in Malaysia. That is stopped at KL. We are excluded.
6. IA Automation, as mentioned. This is going to remove many jobs. In turn we do not need many foreigners and also our own workers. It is gaining traction here and the development is getting faster.
7. Many businessman, like have understood the benefits of running operations across the causeway. (This is our third year, since shifted operations in JB)    
8. Foxccon, the largest contracting manufacturing that builds iPhone, is now working with US to build a fully automated plants that product iPhones at a slightly higher. They are going for big impact to Asia supply chain. It is unknown, how many jobs are going to US. 
9. Our TFR rate is at 1.2. Which is below the replacing level of 2.1 for many years. This will need more imported foreigners to become new citizens to cover the shortfall. Which is not happening. 
10. It is a known fact that Singaporeans love to have second home. That include me. But, many bought second home and hope to rent out. So if majority are doing the recently, what is the competition like ,forward? That is why the rental market is still trending down, even the mass market started warmed up. This was due to to the slight change in policy. But not a signal of a good market. 
 
Naturally, people used the pass decades of data and extrapolate into future. Thinking that the local property will only goes up in time. We are looking alike Japan, where other Asian countries are growing strong during developing stage. This had happened to us between 1970s - 1990s.

Cheap does not mean good. There is always cheap for a reason. It is They are having economy structural issue that is stagnant or deteriorating. Most money will earned from overseas, by the MNCs. Another good example of greying society.  I would not venture into such country. Unless the gov, open the flood gates, which I think Japanese will not willing to do it in a big way.
 
We are heading to that as a greying society. We need more imported new citizens and foreigners. But again, majority do not like that idea.

surrounded by empty apartments. Less noise.

Bro, my advice is not to touch this development. Be-careful of township selling in JB.  What I heard of, almost everyone is a investor of the project. If no one actual stays there, how the retails going to sustain? Eventually, one by one closes and that will deeper impact the market value of those invested there. Think about it. I'm wary about such.

Personally, just a feeling..
I don't think Iskandar will come out good, esp since the PRCs are involved.
If you're looking to invest, it's probably the wrong place.
 
Who can buy your property ? I don't think the locals would, when they can pay probably half the price of what you're paying now.
 
You need new blood (fools), new money to come in.
If the PRC money stopped coming in, then you'll be looking at a dim future.

The be fair to Malaysian properties, I had made 3.5x money when I sold a property in JB, in 2014, after selling Singapore property in 2011. Whereas, Singapore I made only 2.1x. Than bought one in Australia in 2015 end , after the property bust, there.
 
Coming from middle ground, every country have it's pros and cons. Depending on what one needs. Even today, Malaysia also have it's pros. Because worst situation is priced near. Whereas Singapore, the prices are still inflated, due to it's stable rating. Therefore, one have to pay premium to this market and accept low yields.
 
If everyone says, Malaysian properties are no good. It is priced for the worst. There are gems around. One just have to know the place well. My factories are in JB, and goes in often. In fact the place have change alot. Those who seldom interact with the locals, and just head from news in Singapore, may lost opportunities.

 
 
Can you share some gems in JB

Iskandar Malaysia Property Investments – 5 Reasons Why They’re a Bad Idea

Image Source: http://www.iskandarmalaysia.com.my/our-development-plan
A few months back, I entertained the thought of buying a property in Iskandar Malaysia, either as a home for myself, or as a rental property. The relatively weak Malaysian Ringgit makes it a very enticing proposition, but while personal factors (like location of friends, lack of personal transport and poor internet infrastructure) ruled out my using the property as a home, I also quickly realized that it’s also a very bad idea to buy one as an investment.
Now, I don’t pretend to be an expert in property investmenting, but what I do have however, are insights as the son of a real estate agent, and my penchant for (overly?) anal-analytical thinking.
So why is investing in Properties in Iskandar Malaysia currently a bad idea? Here are some of my reasons:
 
1. Limits on Foreigners
There are 2 parts to this.
The 1st one, which is arguably superficial, is that in every project, certain units are always reserved for the local Malay populace. There are informally called ‘Bumi Units’, named after the ‘Bumiputera‘, the policy. You can read more about it here.
In practice, you’ll find that some of the best units will not be available for purchase because you’re not a local Malay. An annoyance for those buying for yourselves, though probably not as big of an issue if you’re planning to rent the place (There are of course loopholes to get around the problem, but we’ll focus on the ‘official’ stuff only, yea?).
The most important thing though, is that foreigners are only allowed to buy property above a certain limit. It was RM500,000, and as of 3rd March’14, it has been raised to RM1,000,000.
Understandably, this is to prevent rapid rise in prices due to over-speculation, which is a good thing for the locals. As an investor however, this will be a problem for your exit strategy, which we’ll talk about later.
 
2. Are Businesses Moving In? Who are your Tenants?
Iskandar Malaysia is being sold as a holistic nirvana where anybody can work, play, and live a balanced life.
Be that as it may, there’s 1 fundamental a lot of new investors miss when they’re considering an investment here; Are businesses moving in?
Think about it. In any new town, businesses must set up shop first before the people (employees of these businesses) move in. I’m not sure that’s the case with this region.
The next time you bring yourself and/or your family along to Johor for your shopping and seafood, keep your eyes open and pay attention to the commercial spaces. Are the shops doing well? Are their customers mostly locals or weekender Singaporeans? Where are the offices, warehouses and other non-retail spaces? Are they filled or mostly empty? etc.
This is important information because you need to figure out who’s going to rent your property and if there’s demand. From what I see so far, demand from local business staff is extremely low.
The other side of this argument is that because of the increasing cost of living in Singapore, more people will starting living cross-causeway livelihoods, working in Singapore while staying in Johor. A valid point, I concede, but honestly, when will the demand start to rise?
How many are willing to spend the extra time, at least twice a day, 5 times a week, enduring traffic jams going to and fro work via the check points? Until Singapore and Malaysia stop bickering and solve this fundamental logistical issue can large scale cross-causeway livelihoods become a reality. This, and the recent measures to (finally) increase supply of houses in Singapore, means that most people will still opt to stay here.
So, who’s going to rent your property?
 
3. Competition Against Other Investors
I shall attempt to figure out why you’re thinking of investing in Iskandar Malaysia with the help of my crystal ball… let’s see now…. mmmm……. ahhh… I see…:
1. You’re new to property investing
2. Malaysia is still ‘familiar’ territory compared to, say, the Philippines or Vietnam
3. Properties in Malaysia are much cheaper than those in Singapore (2.5x cheaper sial!)
4. No Money Down (It seems like the Malaysian government is cracking down on this loophole though)
…. close?
Hey, don’t take it personally. Knowing yourself is half the battle won yes? I’m in the same boat as you =)
With that done… do you see a problem?
We’ve already established that rental demand isn’t exactly hot in that area right now, yes? And yet, it seems like housing in Iskandar is (or was?) selling quite well, and I suspect, to those with the same mindset as you and me.
So, not only do we have questionable demand, but we also seem to have an oversupply of new wannabe ‘investors’ trying to rent as well, which means there will be a large supply of rental properties in the market, and a large supple would mean lower rentals and a lower return on investment, isn’t it?

Mmmm… Singapore Dollars looking Delicious
4. Cheap Investment?
One of my pet peeves is that the word ‘cheap’ is often misused. It’s often used to denote ‘low priced’ when it should mean ‘low for its price’ instead. Let’s put it this way, buying a $1,000,000 sports car that costs $2,000,000 to make is ‘cheap’, while $7.90 for the same nail clipper that can be bought for $2 at a pasar malam (night market) is called ‘expensive’. Price ≠ Actual Value.
Anyway…
A similar problem plagues the mindset of the wannabe investors who are exploring the possibility of investing in Iskandarian properties; They (or We, I should say) feel that these projects are ‘cheap’ because they’re ‘cheaper’ than properties in Singapore.
In my opinion, Iskandar Malaysia is, especially their residential projects, in effect, like Batam Island, in that they’re made to cater to Singaporean cash cows who are willing to be milked. In other words, most of it is hype, with inflated prices and an excess of fake demand.
 
5. Exit Strategy?
Let’s say, for whatever reason, the time has come for you to sell this property of yours. Now, before we talk about making or losing money, let’s talk about the 2 primary factors that will effect your ability to do so:
The RM1,000,000 lower purchase limit on foreigners, and the fact that most properties launched are priced between RM500,000 and RM1,000,000.
Oops.
You have to remember that these projects are not made to be affordable for the locals; They’re there to maximize profits from foreigners (read: Singaporeans) with cash to spare. So, unless the government lowers the limit or there’s a miracle spike in property prices, the limit effectively eliminates all foreigners as potential buyers for your property.
How can you sell.. when there are no buyers?
 
Conclusion
1. Limits on foreigners that limits choices.
2. A practically non-existent rental market.
3. Competing against a large pool of ‘investors’ for a small pool of tenants.
4. Bad value for money.
5. Effectively, no way out of this investment.
Honestly, all one needs to do is to ask some simple questions and do a little research to know that investing in Iskandar Malaysian properties is, at best, a questionable move to make. There are too many things working against you and expecting any of those factors to change is almost akin to gambling, hoping for a good card to appear.
Investing may be a game, but it’s a game you want to win by making informed choices.
There’s a word for taking chances and hoping for the best: Gambling.
At the moment, in my humble opinion, the local government and the property developers made a killing while the ultimate losers are those who bought units before the limit increased to RM1,000,000. These people are stuck with a property that’s extremely difficult sell or rent to break even, much less make a profit out of.
Here’s the thing though; There IS a potential for that place. After all, with the cost of living in Singapore on the rise and its government’s penchant for taking short-cuts to solve its population problem, an increasing number of people will consider staying around Iskandar Malaysia as a permanent compromise between convenience and lower cost of living.
That being said, I believe that the potential will only be realised in the relatively far future, and things will only get much worst before it becomes a viable investment option.
I hope this ‘layman’s’ take on the subject has given some insight into the topic. Remember to share this post, especially with those who are considering a purchase in the area.

have you poll your office people on why they dont want to be a PR or a citizen?
 
Some of them I know tells me that they only using SG as a stepping stone to further their ability to go to US or AU to work. 
 
And I dont even want to go into the Army boys thing as its all water under the bridge.
 
Some of the previous years of passion to go out to explore places like US and AU for us local was viewed with disdain and labelled as quitter and brain drain.
 
I do agree we need to re gen to make up for the population by having good people introduce to the Singapore population. Just that the policy and process to attract the talent and out placement and opportunity in this current state of affair has bough on multiple alienation to the work force.
 
I believe in part, the issuing of PR has slowed down. I know of a office colleague who was so full of himself that he rejected on the invitation to be a PR. But as the industry started to hive off the resource, he got displaced.
 
Now that wants to apply to be a PR so that he does not go back to his home country, the PR application is rejected.
 
Recently the Snr Mini star has spoken about the restriction of labour not only of US and Briexit, but also from india to SG, I think the disadvantage to the local has started to be less of an issue. But its a little too late for many who have being affected in previous years.

Why most in PR status are still PR, and refuse to convert to citizen? I have spoken to many in this status and they found not point of converting , since they can return anytime if the country is having problem or opportunities is reduce. They have 2 way tickets, whereas we have 1.
 
 

have you poll your office people on why they dont want to be a PR or a citizen?
 
Some of them I know tells me that they only using SG as a stepping stone to further their ability to go to US or AU to work. 
 
And I dont even want to go into the Army boys thing as its all water under the bridge.
 
Some of the previous years of passion to go out to explore places like US and AU for us local was viewed with disdain and labelled as quitter and brain drain.
 
I do agree we need to re gen to make up for the population by having good people introduce to the Singapore population. Just that the policy and process to attract the talent and out placement and opportunity in this current state of affair has bough on multiple alienation to the work force.
 
I believe in part, the issuing of PR has slowed down. I know of a office colleague who was so full of himself that he rejected on the invitation to be a PR. But as the industry started to hive off the resource, he got displaced.
 
Now that wants to apply to be a PR so that he does not go back to his home country, the PR application is rejected.
 
Recently the Snr Mini star has spoken about the restriction of labour not only of US and Briexit, but also from india to SG, I think the disadvantage to the local has started to be less of an issue. But its a little too late for many who have being affected in previous years.

Has property prices came down in JB? Country Garden @ Denga Bay (think many singapaorean bought) still selling same price as in 2013?   
Once the JB Sultan removes the 1M restriction, Sing will go in and mop up the supply.

yeah..
 
There was a time during sub prime, every FT that got retrench quickly applied PR because they can choose to give it up if they want to move. But as they were akan datang to be retrenched and the work permit last for a very short duration, many jump on the opportunity.
 
The part where if you become a PR you loose your expat status is what stopping them from getting a PR. There is an easy way out of this and that to take an assignment outside of Sg after 3 to 5 years. Do a 2 years rotation and then come back and enjoy the perks of paid car, paid condo, paid holiday twice a year back to country as well as container load of furnishing bought in and international school of children paid by company. Not forgetting the usual country club and gym benefits which is not used.

Iskandar Malaysia Property Investments – 5 Reasons Why They’re a Bad Idea

Image Source: http://www.iskandarmalaysia.com.my/our-development-plan
A few months back, I entertained the thought of buying a property in Iskandar Malaysia, either as a home for myself, or as a rental property. The relatively weak Malaysian Ringgit makes it a very enticing proposition, but while personal factors (like location of friends, lack of personal transport and poor internet infrastructure) ruled out my using the property as a home, I also quickly realized that it’s also a very bad idea to buy one as an investment.
Now, I don’t pretend to be an expert in property investmenting, but what I do have however, are insights as the son of a real estate agent, and my penchant for (overly?) anal-analytical thinking.
So why is investing in Properties in Iskandar Malaysia currently a bad idea? Here are some of my reasons:
 
1. Limits on Foreigners
There are 2 parts to this.
The 1st one, which is arguably superficial, is that in every project, certain units are always reserved for the local Malay populace. There are informally called ‘Bumi Units’, named after the ‘Bumiputera‘, the policy. You can read more about it here.
In practice, you’ll find that some of the best units will not be available for purchase because you’re not a local Malay. An annoyance for those buying for yourselves, though probably not as big of an issue if you’re planning to rent the place (There are of course loopholes to get around the problem, but we’ll focus on the ‘official’ stuff only, yea?).
The most important thing though, is that foreigners are only allowed to buy property above a certain limit. It was RM500,000, and as of 3rd March’14, it has been raised to RM1,000,000.
Understandably, this is to prevent rapid rise in prices due to over-speculation, which is a good thing for the locals. As an investor however, this will be a problem for your exit strategy, which we’ll talk about later.
 
2. Are Businesses Moving In? Who are your Tenants?
Iskandar Malaysia is being sold as a holistic nirvana where anybody can work, play, and live a balanced life.
Be that as it may, there’s 1 fundamental a lot of new investors miss when they’re considering an investment here; Are businesses moving in?
Think about it. In any new town, businesses must set up shop first before the people (employees of these businesses) move in. I’m not sure that’s the case with this region.
The next time you bring yourself and/or your family along to Johor for your shopping and seafood, keep your eyes open and pay attention to the commercial spaces. Are the shops doing well? Are their customers mostly locals or weekender Singaporeans? Where are the offices, warehouses and other non-retail spaces? Are they filled or mostly empty? etc.
This is important information because you need to figure out who’s going to rent your property and if there’s demand. From what I see so far, demand from local business staff is extremely low.
The other side of this argument is that because of the increasing cost of living in Singapore, more people will starting living cross-causeway livelihoods, working in Singapore while staying in Johor. A valid point, I concede, but honestly, when will the demand start to rise?
How many are willing to spend the extra time, at least twice a day, 5 times a week, enduring traffic jams going to and fro work via the check points? Until Singapore and Malaysia stop bickering and solve this fundamental logistical issue can large scale cross-causeway livelihoods become a reality. This, and the recent measures to (finally) increase supply of houses in Singapore, means that most people will still opt to stay here.
So, who’s going to rent your property?
 
3. Competition Against Other Investors
I shall attempt to figure out why you’re thinking of investing in Iskandar Malaysia with the help of my crystal ball… let’s see now…. mmmm……. ahhh… I see…:
1. You’re new to property investing
2. Malaysia is still ‘familiar’ territory compared to, say, the Philippines or Vietnam
3. Properties in Malaysia are much cheaper than those in Singapore (2.5x cheaper sial!)
4. No Money Down (It seems like the Malaysian government is cracking down on this loophole though)
…. close?
Hey, don’t take it personally. Knowing yourself is half the battle won yes? I’m in the same boat as you =)
With that done… do you see a problem?
We’ve already established that rental demand isn’t exactly hot in that area right now, yes? And yet, it seems like housing in Iskandar is (or was?) selling quite well, and I suspect, to those with the same mindset as you and me.
So, not only do we have questionable demand, but we also seem to have an oversupply of new wannabe ‘investors’ trying to rent as well, which means there will be a large supply of rental properties in the market, and a large supple would mean lower rentals and a lower return on investment, isn’t it?

Mmmm… Singapore Dollars looking Delicious
4. Cheap Investment?
One of my pet peeves is that the word ‘cheap’ is often misused. It’s often used to denote ‘low priced’ when it should mean ‘low for its price’ instead. Let’s put it this way, buying a $1,000,000 sports car that costs $2,000,000 to make is ‘cheap’, while $7.90 for the same nail clipper that can be bought for $2 at a pasar malam (night market) is called ‘expensive’. Price ≠ Actual Value.
Anyway…
A similar problem plagues the mindset of the wannabe investors who are exploring the possibility of investing in Iskandarian properties; They (or We, I should say) feel that these projects are ‘cheap’ because they’re ‘cheaper’ than properties in Singapore.
In my opinion, Iskandar Malaysia is, especially their residential projects, in effect, like Batam Island, in that they’re made to cater to Singaporean cash cows who are willing to be milked. In other words, most of it is hype, with inflated prices and an excess of fake demand.
 
5. Exit Strategy?
Let’s say, for whatever reason, the time has come for you to sell this property of yours. Now, before we talk about making or losing money, let’s talk about the 2 primary factors that will effect your ability to do so:
The RM1,000,000 lower purchase limit on foreigners, and the fact that most properties launched are priced between RM500,000 and RM1,000,000.
Oops.
You have to remember that these projects are not made to be affordable for the locals; They’re there to maximize profits from foreigners (read: Singaporeans) with cash to spare. So, unless the government lowers the limit or there’s a miracle spike in property prices, the limit effectively eliminates all foreigners as potential buyers for your property.
How can you sell.. when there are no buyers?
 
Conclusion
1. Limits on foreigners that limits choices.
2. A practically non-existent rental market.
3. Competing against a large pool of ‘investors’ for a small pool of tenants.
4. Bad value for money.
5. Effectively, no way out of this investment.
Honestly, all one needs to do is to ask some simple questions and do a little research to know that investing in Iskandar Malaysian properties is, at best, a questionable move to make. There are too many things working against you and expecting any of those factors to change is almost akin to gambling, hoping for a good card to appear.
Investing may be a game, but it’s a game you want to win by making informed choices.
There’s a word for taking chances and hoping for the best: Gambling.
At the moment, in my humble opinion, the local government and the property developers made a killing while the ultimate losers are those who bought units before the limit increased to RM1,000,000. These people are stuck with a property that’s extremely difficult sell or rent to break even, much less make a profit out of.
Here’s the thing though; There IS a potential for that place. After all, with the cost of living in Singapore on the rise and its government’s penchant for taking short-cuts to solve its population problem, an increasing number of people will consider staying around Iskandar Malaysia as a permanent compromise between convenience and lower cost of living.
That being said, I believe that the potential will only be realised in the relatively far future, and things will only get much worst before it becomes a viable investment option.
I hope this ‘layman’s’ take on the subject has given some insight into the topic. Remember to share this post, especially with those who are considering a purchase in the area.
Do check out another take on the same topic @ Dr Wealth: Iskandar Malaysia is Only Going One Way – Down. Research is always important, yes?

Hadn't been to JB for a while and dropped in for supper last Friday. The whole place is really very well developed as compared to a few years back and I wouldn't be surprised that if a cheap alternative link is build between JB and SG, there will be people moving there.
 
Looking at all the developments, they look really good.

yup. JB got bad and certainly also GOOD.
we can't ignore the rise of ISKANDAR
it's somewhat a game changer
international school, hospital, MNC regional plant/service/dept, govt and business services, etc will slowly emerge and mature in JB Iskandar
even ah gong already advise us to retire in JB

Nearly bought 2 yrs back.. then saw the Iskandar development plan and map..many area still empty.
 
At the price of that terrace or bungalow, already priced out of reach from many locals..which means they are only able to target foreigners.
 
The education, medical and financial hub is still in it's infancy.. we don't even know the determination from boleh gov to see it through and make it a success.
 
If they will, it may take the next 10 years or more, and again with the large land mass, price may not be able to appreciate much.
And if they don't... good luck..
 
Speculative hit and run, maybe possible, but I was not willing to take the risk then.

 
my personal take without vested interest
 
unlike many other parts of Malaysia, I feel JB is relative safe in terms of property investment. The close proximity to Singapore, Singapore companies investing and setting up shop there including hospitals, their Sultan has a huge stake in many of the property developments and JB is fairly independent minded compare to other states with regards to politics and like Penang there are more Chinese people. 
 
Unfortunately, there is always a wild card but nobody knows the future eg whether BN will win the majority at the next election. Or the relationship between Singapore and Malaysia. The amount of foreign investment into Malaysia is frightening so much so that Singapore authorities are opening up their eyes and now realized that they cannot take things for granted or rely on past quanxi after we were left behind in China's One belt .......

Only the reverse is true. If you own a Johor residential property (or any residential property internationally including SG), you cannot buy HDB.

First of all, I have to apologize for jumping into the assumption that no one has actually bought an unit in Johor Bahru which will then render my post redundant. (In a way, admitting that I did not read from post 1 to the end)
 
Secondly, I do apologize for the lengthy post as I feel it might be beneficial to share my personal experience.
 
I am one who have taken the plunge back in 2015. It was a casual JB weekend shopping with my wife and we were approached by a keen salesman at the KSL Property booth. After 45mins of listening to him, we made the unthinkable decision to buy a 3 bedder. Don't ask me why we made such a hasty decision, perhaps the lure of having a condo with facilities at a fraction of what my HDB costs was just too tempting at that time.
 
The ironic part is when we were departing JB coming back to Singapore, then both of us started to panic and wonder if we were too impulsive. I did my sum and assuming if I remained employed, I should be able to afford the impulsive purchase. We were kinda of leaving the divine to decide as we might not get the loan also.
 
2 weeks later, surprisingly, our loan was approved and we were asked to go down to sign the SPA (Sales and Purchase Agreement), now this is getting serious. We had a talk over dinner and decided to go ahead and do 1 stupid thing at least. So we secured the unit.
 
Destiny always has her way I reckon, several months later, suddenly my wife and my mom decided they do not see eye to eye and a storm was brewing. I also feel it is definitely tough for my wife to stay in Singapore further as she is a Malaysian with PR status in Singapore. However she is not highly educated. Therefore, it was really hard for her to secure good payment employment in Singapore. Both of us decided to go ahead to move into JB and attempt to check out lifestyle in JB before our unit TOP in 2018.
 
2 weeks later, we actually rented a terrace house and within 3 days, we actually moved into JB. Again another impulsive and decision without much thought thru. But hey, life is more interesting this way I feel.
 
I still vividly remember my first night in a terrace house doing "guard duty" as I heard far too many horror stories about JB on how people can climb over your gate and rob you at knife point plus force you to watch while they raped your wife. I was determined to stay vigilant (cannot remember I was that "garang" during NSF days even). Touchwood, nothing happened.
 
Very fast, a week of annual leave passed and I have to go back to work (in Singapore). I remembered waking up at 2am to prepare myself for work and for the next 3 days, I almost gave up every time I arrived at customs (woodlands or tuas) only to be turned off by the sheer volume of the jam.
 
Surprisingly, on the 4th days, I seems to take all this in nicely like a man, I stopped grumbling to my wife when I was home. Somehow, I look forward to Saturday and Sunday plus Public Holiday in JB. I kinda of realized that I am willing to give up my convenience for 5 days in exchange for quality lifestyle for 2 days.
 
I always shared this statement when friends asking me how is my JB life. I told them it is not meant for everybody. There are a lot of sacrifices to make and your desire to "become a Malaysian" must be strong. Then you will enjoy. One good example is how I managed to make friends within the neighborhood in my 1st month staying in JB while I yet to know my next door neighbor of 13 years in Singapore.
 
Fast forward 2.5 years, I have already gotten used to staying in JB, I still do have my HDB in Singapore which I stayed overnight if I worked too late, however I just cannot seem to sleep in HDB anymore. The entire place just seem so cold but yet noisy. 
 
Most importantly, i have realized, these 2.5 years, I hardly have any true bloodied Singaporeans as neighbors, my HDB block is filled with PRC, Filippino, Indians and Ang Mo..... Apparently, I find myself happier in Malaysia with my neighbors speaking in Mandarin thick with "Lian Bang Ying" (Malaysia Accent).

First of all, I have to apologize for jumping into the assumption that no one has actually bought an unit in Johor Bahru which will then render my post redundant. (In a way, admitting that I did not read from post 1 to the end)
 
Secondly, I do apologize for the lengthy post as I feel it might be beneficial to share my personal experience.
 
I am one who have taken the plunge back in 2015. It was a casual JB weekend shopping with my wife and we were approached by a keen salesman at the KSL Property booth. After 45mins of listening to him, we made the unthinkable decision to buy a 3 bedder. Don't ask me why we made such a hasty decision, perhaps the lure of having a condo with facilities at a fraction of what my HDB costs was just too tempting at that time.
 
The ironic part is when we were departing JB coming back to Singapore, then both of us started to panic and wonder if we were too impulsive. I did my sum and assuming if I remained employed, I should be able to afford the impulsive purchase. We were kinda of leaving the divine to decide as we might not get the loan also.
 
2 weeks later, surprisingly, our loan was approved and we were asked to go down to sign the SPA (Sales and Purchase Agreement), now this is getting serious. We had a talk over dinner and decided to go ahead and do 1 stupid thing at least. So we secured the unit.
 
Destiny always has her way I reckon, several months later, suddenly my wife and my mom decided they do not see eye to eye and a storm was brewing. I also feel it is definitely tough for my wife to stay in Singapore further as she is a Malaysian with PR status in Singapore. However she is not highly educated. Therefore, it was really hard for her to secure good payment employment in Singapore. Both of us decided to go ahead to move into JB and attempt to check out lifestyle in JB before our unit TOP in 2018.

Sorry for missing that out, expected VP (Vacant Possession) or take key in April only.
 
Likelihood will move into the 3 bedder as I kinda of swing towards having gym and swimming pools within the development.
 
Unlike Singapore, to locate a economical gym and public swimming pools is really tough in JB.

Imagine someone with 100 international properties, come to SG becomes PR then buys a HDB. Any issue?
 
he have to sell all 100 properties then only can buy hddeebbbee.....
then again, if he can afford 100 properties, why look at hdbbb? hahaha
 
dunno who came up with this policy...those who buys hdb are either citizens or PR....

I get that remarks pretty often, trust me, I am mentally prepared to accept quality of sloppy work given I am paying less than what a 3 room flat cost. Why should I expect a SGD Million dollar quality finish?
 
It is always about aligning your expectation and reality.
 
Look at the recent Punggol and Sengkang Tiles Eruption cases. Paying 200-400k SGD does not also guarantee you quality finish.
 
For me, it is just having a roof over the head in a foreign country I choose to call home.
 
However, a couple of comments do make sense to those who intend to shift over and enjoy 1:3 exchange rate. That is if you are buying property for your own stay. You can look around slowly. 2018-2019 going to be slow for developers as based on statistics captured, There are approximately around 80k new units coming out of the pipeline. Buying sentiment is lukewarm now as there are still many uncertainties in Malaysia, Government is one of the main factors. They can never seem to make up their mind and are still so ever keen to use racism as their chips on gaining political points.
 
Having said that, looking at Singapore government recent action plans, I will not say they have well thought out plans as well. 30% increase in water tariff, proposed 9% GST, Travelling out of Singapore Airport Tariff and etc. Does not seem like our politicians are Million Dollar Package Deal nowadays as well:)

agree with most of your points
but i disagree on the point that jb condo is cheaper than sg hdb, hence we should/must accept the inferior quality
 
cheap is cheap for a reason
the land in msia is much much cheaper than sg
the build cost in msia is cheaper than sg
willing seller willing buyer
they must DELIVER what they PROMISE
the mentality of ... aiya cheaper than sg already ... mai hiam la ... this is unacceptable
 
if when they sell the condo to you that time ... tell you the pipe will be broken or choke
the window will be misaligned ... the floor will be uneven .... etc
will you buy?
 
however, they tell you 5-star living but comes 0-star unit, acceptable?

Hey, don't mention it, sharing is what this forum is for right?
 
the HDB is currently housing my parents, As usual, the common worry of old folks are JB is dangerous, not familiar with road, old liao hard to make friends easily etc.. 
 
So instead of convincing them, I leave them where they are comfortable.

Valid Points indeed.
 
I apologize for misunderstanding your concern.
 
I was not referring to accepting the problems you listed out but lousier material used. Like hinges or wooden door and tiles. For development defects, in contract, I will have 24 months to bring up to management. 
 
Well, I am sure you also heard about non responsive management to defects right? One thing I hate about Malaysia now despite the thousands things I love is speed to action. They are usually very laid back when it comes to work. The good thing is I am still renting a place to stay. I can wait for them to rectify the unit defects to my satisfaction before I move in. One day I not taking over the key due to defect, one day the bank is not disbursing the money to them. :)

Actually for reputable developers in Malaysia, the quality are often even better than SG property. Here the bulk goes into land price, the developer has little room to create excellent quality.
 
But JB problem is land abundance but work environment and culture not there. Reverse problem.
 
Here our people are better at keeping quiet perhaps.

I stay in a condo by a branded developer and all the door handles and windows also not fantastic quality. 
Maybe the Malaysian developer could actually be better.

it all depend on which developer for the project. we had 2 unit there (1 at east ledang and 1 at puteri harbour), the materials that they are using is of equivalent to our condo in sin except the flooring is tile instead of marble, other than that the switches are from Schneider, daikin aircon, Electrolux oven, toto... the lift itself and the life lobby are air conditioned (I think very few condo in sin come with aircon lobby and lift).
 
there bound to have some defect in the common area, eg., swimming pool, design of security system, gym... therefore, a strong management committee is a must to deal with the developer. in most cases, the developer will give in to improve or enhance on their initial design fault under the strong pressure from the committee.
 
do also take note that most condo purchased in Malaysia does include allocated parking lots, residents do not park their car at their own lots can be a frustrating issue to some owners.
 
the thought of buying properties in Malaysia is to provide us an alternative when retirement. we had made 1 unit into our weekend home and yet to decide for the other unit. you will be save as long as you are not a speculator as you will not be able to see immediate return investing in Malaysia property.
 
do enjoy your new home.

Another thing I also notice is the quality of renovation contractors in Malaysia. I also heard many horror stories related to payment made but sub-standard job done. My current neighbor is one victim of such. He trying to change his auto-gate and after 2 weeks with no gate, I started to ask him what happened, he told me his contractor ran away and change hp no!!!
 
Otherwise, we can always engage contractor to change whatever we do not like.
 
Ya looking forward to the gym and swimming pool:)

That's really comforting to know.
 
Once a property agent in Singapore told me something which pretty much make sense. Smaller developers are trying to impress at the expense of their profit margin, so "ingredients" are better (however in Malaysia, you risked smaller developers closing down overnight and leave the project unattended).

this point absolutely agree.  few years back i on business trip to kl.  saw a an uncompleted building and found out from colleague that it is uncompleted because developer gone bust.  it probably hasn't happen in singapore before.
 
i had a KL project with a more reputed developer.  i find the fnnishing so so.  no major defects though.

You must be a rare crazy Singaporean that dare to venture out. Most of them in fact all of them that I know of are mentally jailed by their white master. 
They can debate the idiotic policies churning out by the apathy elites and scholars on daily basis yet dare not do something about it. 
 
Everyone here is just trying to grab their pie of share, those benefits from the policy are quietly enjoying the fruits, for those who refused to do so is almost certainly will be ended up on chopping board, without knowing that the knife is getting sharper and sharper as the time goes by. 
 
It is not about for better life quality or greener pasture out there,  but rather to have the sense of adventurous, something that cannot be taught at school.

Haha, apparently almost 99.99% of my friends thought so as well. It is not so much about my decision to venture across the border but more for the time frame of decision making I took.
 
Honestly speaking, knowing my neighborhood, I see quite a number of Singaporeans who moved over for several common reasons like "Pre-Retirement Getting Used to the Culture First", "Earn SGD and Spend MYR - SHIOK!", "HDB small and Crave for Landed", "Husband working while whole family to feed, so 1:3 conversion helps" etc....
 
However, as I mentioned earlier, moving into JB is really not an easy and simple decision especially if you have kids, I know 1 Singaporean Malay Family who sold their Woodland Jumbo Flat for SGD580k, after minus here and there, they still got cash proceeding of nearly SGD150k, they down for a semi-d in one of the upper-class estate in JB. Bring their 3 kids with them into Malaysia however all still work and study in Singapore. After 6 months, they put up cheap sale for their semi-d and rent back a 5 room flat in Singapore as their lifestyle completely in a mess due to the constant travelling in and out of Singapore even on weekend for the kids school ECA.
 
For my case, I am the only one travelling in and out which makes me pretty mobile and flexibility work schedule helps as well.

with $150K nia and want to live like king in a landed property in JB? 
 
Actually that is the common mindset of a lot of low-middle class Singaporeans. The illusion of exchange rate clouded their judgement, I am guilty of that previously as well. From a 4-digit salaried guy jumps to a 5 digits has this WOW factor, sad to say it is surreal.
 
Imagine a normal family suddenly has 450k cashand even if they are buying a 1.8million dollar semi d, they can afford the 360k downpayment with 90k spare for a bmw downpayment. All these can be achieved in Malaysia.
 
However, if your lifestyle becomes harder, then it will not be sustainable in long run. 

I wish more people scared to go in JB shopping, pump petrol and go massage parlour.
 
Then jam not so bad.
 
 

 
From my personal observation, many will complain how scary it is to go JB, however whenever I am going back jb on a friday evening or eve of a public holiday. I still see tons of S plate cars who are looking at spending holidays in JB.

Singapore property will ultimately get completed, but there may be long term issues.
 
There are developments with very much delayed TOP even in Singapore.
 
 

this point absolutely agree.  few years back i on business trip to kl.  saw a an uncompleted building and found out from colleague that it is uncompleted because developer gone bust.  it probably hasn't happen in singapore before.
 
i had a KL project with a more reputed developer.  i find the fnnishing so so.  no major defects though.

definitely.  like the most well known case recently at the sail.  i am not saying it is all a bed of roses for singapore property buyers.
 
but definitely there are more risks of loss purchasing malaysian property - be it developer went buss or shoddy workmanship not rectified.  in fact, this recent case of shoddy workmanship is just one of the many i have heard over the years on malaysian properties.  somehow from my perspective, either have to buy at leap of faith or go for more reputed developer's projects.

We take buyers' feedback seriously, says Country Garden 
 

 
Country Garden Danga Bay Sdn Bhd — the developer of the Danga Bay mega-project in Johor — will meet their buyers who have lodged complaints with the Housing and Strata Management Tribunal here again to find a solution to their problems, said Country Garden Malaysia regional president Jason Fu.
 
Speaking to reporters after a media tour of the mega-development today, Fu said Country Garden will continue to work closely with all their customers to resolve their concerns, including those regarding safety and workmanship.
“We have been receiving feedback [from our buyers] all the time and we will work closely with them to solve their concerns.
“Even though we have sold a majority of the units [in Danga Bay], it doesn’t mean that our work is finished. We want this project, community and society to be successful.
“We are here to stay for the long term and we don’t want to lose any customers, not even one,” he said.

What are the monthly berthing fees?
​
Capri's berth at One 15 Marina is $1,375 + GST per month. The marina also charges for water and electricity which is typically another $200 - 300 per month depending on how much you use the ACs and water usage. 
​
Is financing available?
​
You would need to check with your bank about financing options. You can't purchase Capri via a mortgage but you probably can via a personal loan.

it is a mistake to compare Malaysia, especially JB property price and that of Sg. Johor is how many tines bigger than us and there are no rental potential. even if it is $100k ringgit, it would not appreciate much, dont talk about yield. maybe you buy because you wish to stay but rent woukd be a better choice.
 
Sg with limited land, property can only goes up. but also need to be careful. some are priced too high liao. of ckurse, in 10-15 years, what is high now may not be so. more due to inflation

Johor Forest City project off limits to foreign buyers: Mahathir
 
KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia will not allow foreigners to buy residential units built at the US$100 billion Forest City project in Johor, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Monday (Aug 27). 
 
The project has been wracked by uncertainty since Mahathir's coalition scored a shock victory at a May general election, as developer Country Garden Holdings Co looks to revive faltering demand for its plans to build a city that would be home to 700,000 people.
 
"One thing is certain, that city that is going to be built cannot be sold to foreigners. We are not going to give visas for people to come and live here," Mahathir told reporters at a press conference.
 
"Our objection is because it was built for foreigners, not built for Malaysians. Most Malaysians are unable to buy those flats."

Iskandar Malaysia Property Investments – 5 Reasons Why They’re a Bad Idea
 
By aaron loy

Image Source: http://www.iskandarmalaysia.com.my/our-development-plan
A few months back, I entertained the thought of buying a property in Iskandar Malaysia, either as a home for myself, or as a rental property. The relatively weak Malaysian Ringgit makes it a very enticing proposition, but while personal factors (like location of friends, lack of personal transport and poor internet infrastructure) ruled out my using the property as a home, I also quickly realized that it’s also a very bad idea to buy one as an investment.
Now, I don’t pretend to be an expert in property investmenting, but what I do have however, are insights as the son of a real estate agent, and my penchant for (overly?) anal-analytical thinking.
So why is investing in Properties in Iskandar Malaysia currently a bad idea? Here are some of my reasons:
 
1. Limits on Foreigners
There are 2 parts to this.
The 1st one, which is arguably superficial, is that in every project, certain units are always reserved for the local Malay populace. There are informally called ‘Bumi Units’, named after the ‘Bumiputera‘, the policy. You can read more about it here.
In practice, you’ll find that some of the best units will not be available for purchase because you’re not a local Malay. An annoyance for those buying for yourselves, though probably not as big of an issue if you’re planning to rent the place (There are of course loopholes to get around the problem, but we’ll focus on the ‘official’ stuff only, yea?).
The most important thing though, is that foreigners are only allowed to buy property above a certain limit. It was RM500,000, and as of 3rd March’14, it has been raised to RM1,000,000.
Understandably, this is to prevent rapid rise in prices due to over-speculation, which is a good thing for the locals. As an investor however, this will be a problem for your exit strategy, which we’ll talk about later.
 
2. Are Businesses Moving In? Who are your Tenants?
Iskandar Malaysia is being sold as a holistic nirvana where anybody can work, play, and live a balanced life.
Be that as it may, there’s 1 fundamental a lot of new investors miss when they’re considering an investment here; Are businesses moving in?
Think about it. In any new town, businesses must set up shop first before the people (employees of these businesses) move in. I’m not sure that’s the case with this region.
The next time you bring yourself and/or your family along to Johor for your shopping and seafood, keep your eyes open and pay attention to the commercial spaces. Are the shops doing well? Are their customers mostly locals or weekender Singaporeans? Where are the offices, warehouses and other non-retail spaces? Are they filled or mostly empty? etc.
This is important information because you need to figure out who’s going to rent your property and if there’s demand. From what I see so far, demand from local business staff is extremely low.
The other side of this argument is that because of the increasing cost of living in Singapore, more people will starting living cross-causeway livelihoods, working in Singapore while staying in Johor. A valid point, I concede, but honestly, when will the demand start to rise?
How many are willing to spend the extra time, at least twice a day, 5 times a week, enduring traffic jams going to and fro work via the check points? Until Singapore and Malaysia stop bickering and solve this fundamental logistical issue can large scale cross-causeway livelihoods become a reality. This, and the recent measures to (finally) increase supply of houses in Singapore, means that most people will still opt to stay here.
So, who’s going to rent your property?
 
3. Competition Against Other Investors
I shall attempt to figure out why you’re thinking of investing in Iskandar Malaysia with the help of my crystal ball… let’s see now…. mmmm……. ahhh… I see…:
1. You’re new to property investing
2. Malaysia is still ‘familiar’ territory compared to, say, the Philippines or Vietnam
3. Properties in Malaysia are much cheaper than those in Singapore (2.5x cheaper sial!)
4. No Money Down (It seems like the Malaysian government is cracking down on this loophole though)
…. close?
Hey, don’t take it personally. Knowing yourself is half the battle won yes? I’m in the same boat as you =)
With that done… do you see a problem?
We’ve already established that rental demand isn’t exactly hot in that area right now, yes? And yet, it seems like housing in Iskandar is (or was?) selling quite well, and I suspect, to those with the same mindset as you and me.
So, not only do we have questionable demand, but we also seem to have an oversupply of new wannabe ‘investors’ trying to rent as well, which means there will be a large supply of rental properties in the market, and a large supple would mean lower rentals and a lower return on investment, isn’t it?

Mmmm… Singapore Dollars looking Delicious
4. Cheap Investment?
One of my pet peeves is that the word ‘cheap’ is often misused. It’s often used to denote ‘low priced’ when it should mean ‘low for its price’ instead. Let’s put it this way, buying a $1,000,000 sports car that costs $2,000,000 to make is ‘cheap’, while $7.90 for the same nail clipper that can be bought for $2 at a pasar malam (night market) is called ‘expensive’. Price ≠ Actual Value.
Anyway…
A similar problem plagues the mindset of the wannabe investors who are exploring the possibility of investing in Iskandarian properties; They (or We, I should say) feel that these projects are ‘cheap’ because they’re ‘cheaper’ than properties in Singapore.
In my opinion, Iskandar Malaysia is, especially their residential projects, in effect, like Batam Island, in that they’re made to cater to Singaporean cash cows who are willing to be milked. In other words, most of it is hype, with inflated prices and an excess of fake demand.
 
5. Exit Strategy?
Let’s say, for whatever reason, the time has come for you to sell this property of yours. Now, before we talk about making or losing money, let’s talk about the 2 primary factors that will effect your ability to do so:
The RM1,000,000 lower purchase limit on foreigners, and the fact that most properties launched are priced between RM500,000 and RM1,000,000.
Oops.
You have to remember that these projects are not made to be affordable for the locals; They’re there to maximize profits from foreigners (read: Singaporeans) with cash to spare. So, unless the government lowers the limit or there’s a miracle spike in property prices, the limit effectively eliminates all foreigners as potential buyers for your property.
How can you sell.. when there are no buyers?
 
Conclusion
1. Limits on foreigners that limits choices.
2. A practically non-existent rental market.
3. Competing against a large pool of ‘investors’ for a small pool of tenants.
4. Bad value for money.
5. Effectively, no way out of this investment.
Honestly, all one needs to do is to ask some simple questions and do a little research to know that investing in Iskandar Malaysian properties is, at best, a questionable move to make. There are too many things working against you and expecting any of those factors to change is almost akin to gambling, hoping for a good card to appear.
Investing may be a game, but it’s a game you want to win by making informed choices.
There’s a word for taking chances and hoping for the best: Gambling.
At the moment, in my humble opinion, the local government and the property developers made a killing while the ultimate losers are those who bought units before the limit increased to RM1,000,000. These people are stuck with a property that’s extremely difficult sell or rent to break even, much less make a profit out of.
Here’s the thing though; There IS a potential for that place. After all, with the cost of living in Singapore on the rise and its government’s penchant for taking short-cuts to solve its population problem, an increasing number of people will consider staying around Iskandar Malaysia as a permanent compromise between convenience and lower cost of living.
That being said, I believe that the potential will only be realised in the relatively far future, and things will only get much worst before it becomes a viable investment option.
I hope this ‘layman’s’ take on the subject has given some insight into the topic. Remember to share this post, especially with those who are considering a purchase in the area.
Do check out another take on the same topic @ Dr Wealth: Iskandar Malaysia is Only Going One Way – Down. Research is always important, yes?

Well from the start, the economic benefit to ordinary Johoreans was always bit dubious. This project was always controversial just that it's backed by the Sultan who is generally well liked in his state. 
 
So i won't say his strategy is wrong.

Johor is already oversupplied, especially for properties over a million ringgit, now with this new govt that changes the rules with a stroke of the pen, who is going to buy?  Think a big crash is near.

yeah. basically there are 2 types of potential buyers, singaporeans and middle income chinese wanting to dump some money into diversification (the richer ones will be in australia, japan, canada etc). singaporeans can always just buy whenever they feel like it since it's just across the border.

Iskandar Malaysia Property Investments – 5 Reasons Why They’re a Bad Idea

Image Source: http://www.iskandarmalaysia.com.my/our-development-plan
A few months back, I entertained the thought of buying a property in Iskandar Malaysia, either as a home for myself, or as a rental property. The relatively weak Malaysian Ringgit makes it a very enticing proposition, but while personal factors (like location of friends, lack of personal transport and poor internet infrastructure) ruled out my using the property as a home, I also quickly realized that it’s also a very bad idea to buy one as an investment.
Now, I don’t pretend to be an expert in property investmenting, but what I do have however, are insights as the son of a real estate agent, and my penchant for (overly?) anal-analytical thinking.
So why is investing in Properties in Iskandar Malaysia currently a bad idea? Here are some of my reasons:
 
1. Limits on Foreigners
There are 2 parts to this.
The 1st one, which is arguably superficial, is that in every project, certain units are always reserved for the local Malay populace. There are informally called ‘Bumi Units’, named after the ‘Bumiputera‘, the policy. You can read more about it here.
In practice, you’ll find that some of the best units will not be available for purchase because you’re not a local Malay. An annoyance for those buying for yourselves, though probably not as big of an issue if you’re planning to rent the place (There are of course loopholes to get around the problem, but we’ll focus on the ‘official’ stuff only, yea?).
The most important thing though, is that foreigners are only allowed to buy property above a certain limit. It was RM500,000, and as of 3rd March’14, it has been raised to RM1,000,000.
Understandably, this is to prevent rapid rise in prices due to over-speculation, which is a good thing for the locals. As an investor however, this will be a problem for your exit strategy, which we’ll talk about later.
 
2. Are Businesses Moving In? Who are your Tenants?
Iskandar Malaysia is being sold as a holistic nirvana where anybody can work, play, and live a balanced life.
Be that as it may, there’s 1 fundamental a lot of new investors miss when they’re considering an investment here; Are businesses moving in?
Think about it. In any new town, businesses must set up shop first before the people (employees of these businesses) move in. I’m not sure that’s the case with this region.
The next time you bring yourself and/or your family along to Johor for your shopping and seafood, keep your eyes open and pay attention to the commercial spaces. Are the shops doing well? Are their customers mostly locals or weekender Singaporeans? Where are the offices, warehouses and other non-retail spaces? Are they filled or mostly empty? etc.
This is important information because you need to figure out who’s going to rent your property and if there’s demand. From what I see so far, demand from local business staff is extremely low.
The other side of this argument is that because of the increasing cost of living in Singapore, more people will starting living cross-causeway livelihoods, working in Singapore while staying in Johor. A valid point, I concede, but honestly, when will the demand start to rise?
How many are willing to spend the extra time, at least twice a day, 5 times a week, enduring traffic jams going to and fro work via the check points? Until Singapore and Malaysia stop bickering and solve this fundamental logistical issue can large scale cross-causeway livelihoods become a reality. This, and the recent measures to (finally) increase supply of houses in Singapore, means that most people will still opt to stay here.
So, who’s going to rent your property?
 
3. Competition Against Other Investors
I shall attempt to figure out why you’re thinking of investing in Iskandar Malaysia with the help of my crystal ball… let’s see now…. mmmm……. ahhh… I see…:
1. You’re new to property investing
2. Malaysia is still ‘familiar’ territory compared to, say, the Philippines or Vietnam
3. Properties in Malaysia are much cheaper than those in Singapore (2.5x cheaper sial!)
4. No Money Down (It seems like the Malaysian government is cracking down on this loophole though)
…. close?
Hey, don’t take it personally. Knowing yourself is half the battle won yes? I’m in the same boat as you =)
With that done… do you see a problem?
We’ve already established that rental demand isn’t exactly hot in that area right now, yes? And yet, it seems like housing in Iskandar is (or was?) selling quite well, and I suspect, to those with the same mindset as you and me.
So, not only do we have questionable demand, but we also seem to have an oversupply of new wannabe ‘investors’ trying to rent as well, which means there will be a large supply of rental properties in the market, and a large supple would mean lower rentals and a lower return on investment, isn’t it?

Mmmm… Singapore Dollars looking Delicious
4. Cheap Investment?
One of my pet peeves is that the word ‘cheap’ is often misused. It’s often used to denote ‘low priced’ when it should mean ‘low for its price’ instead. Let’s put it this way, buying a $1,000,000 sports car that costs $2,000,000 to make is ‘cheap’, while $7.90 for the same nail clipper that can be bought for $2 at a pasar malam (night market) is called ‘expensive’. Price ≠ Actual Value.
Anyway…
A similar problem plagues the mindset of the wannabe investors who are exploring the possibility of investing in Iskandarian properties; They (or We, I should say) feel that these projects are ‘cheap’ because they’re ‘cheaper’ than properties in Singapore.
In my opinion, Iskandar Malaysia is, especially their residential projects, in effect, like Batam Island, in that they’re made to cater to Singaporean cash cows who are willing to be milked. In other words, most of it is hype, with inflated prices and an excess of fake demand.
 
5. Exit Strategy?
Let’s say, for whatever reason, the time has come for you to sell this property of yours. Now, before we talk about making or losing money, let’s talk about the 2 primary factors that will effect your ability to do so:
The RM1,000,000 lower purchase limit on foreigners, and the fact that most properties launched are priced between RM500,000 and RM1,000,000.
Oops.
You have to remember that these projects are not made to be affordable for the locals; They’re there to maximize profits from foreigners (read: Singaporeans) with cash to spare. So, unless the government lowers the limit or there’s a miracle spike in property prices, the limit effectively eliminates all foreigners as potential buyers for your property.
How can you sell.. when there are no buyers?
 
Conclusion
1. Limits on foreigners that limits choices.
2. A practically non-existent rental market.
3. Competing against a large pool of ‘investors’ for a small pool of tenants.
4. Bad value for money.
5. Effectively, no way out of this investment.
Honestly, all one needs to do is to ask some simple questions and do a little research to know that investing in Iskandar Malaysian properties is, at best, a questionable move to make. There are too many things working against you and expecting any of those factors to change is almost akin to gambling, hoping for a good card to appear.
Investing may be a game, but it’s a game you want to win by making informed choices.
There’s a word for taking chances and hoping for the best: Gambling.
At the moment, in my humble opinion, the local government and the property developers made a killing while the ultimate losers are those who bought units before the limit increased to RM1,000,000. These people are stuck with a property that’s extremely difficult sell or rent to break even, much less make a profit out of.
Here’s the thing though; There IS a potential for that place. After all, with the cost of living in Singapore on the rise and its government’s penchant for taking short-cuts to solve its population problem, an increasing number of people will consider staying around Iskandar Malaysia as a permanent compromise between convenience and lower cost of living.
That being said, I believe that the potential will only be realised in the relatively far future, and things will only get much worst before it becomes a viable investment option.
I hope this ‘layman’s’ take on the subject has given some insight into the topic. Remember to share this post, especially with those who are considering a purchase in the area.
Do check out another take on the same topic @ Dr Wealth: Iskandar Malaysia is Only Going One Way – Down. Research is always important, yes?

Or the he couldn't bargain any deals from the Chinese so purposely flop this mega project to show his displeasure??China government would welcome  this move. They have been trying to stop outflow of money, the recent Malaysia's move helps them reduce their headache. Those who have committed  is a individual's problem,  government woildnt bother much. After all some of them are probably doing preopert laundry. ... a new way to launder their black money.

You have already planned your retirement. Move around these areas and stay a couple of months each time. Why need to be stuck in 1 place? In between them, you can also visit other countries or states.

I guess your plan is to retire or you are already staying in Malaysia with that kind of budget? Questions I have will be
 
1) Why put in $1M in a fixed asset when you can use that $1M to improve quality of life? You expecting financial gain after you are gone?
2) I am assuming you are retiring after 65 and you looking at another 30 years max? Your last 5-10 years, are you able to live the lifestyle you have planned and the cost remains the same?
3) Sure you will be happy travelling around peninsula Malaysia for the next 30 years? That $1 M can bring you further you know.
4) At 70 and above, I think a house will be too much to handle and costly if you need helper.

Nowadays everytime I visit a shopping mall in JB, there will be a handful roadshow for selling properties. Agents all trying to sell you those units. Which means there are many many empty units available. And mind you, they are still building and building. For me, I'll just use Airbnb to try out those recently completed projects like Country Garden and Princess Cove.

Most developers from Malaysia are not good so buy with a lot of caution, or prepare to fork out another $30-40k RM to fix the defects yourself.
 
Singapore's developers are catching up with delivering poor quality houses, and they seem to be able to get away with it in recent court cases.

When is the gigantic Mid Valley Megamall in JB opening? Heard it is more than 3x the size of Vivo city.  Hope it will be like the one in KL, with 2 cinemas, tons of F&B options, massage shops, etc.  
 
Will consider staycation if they build a decent hotel there.  Think the plan is 4.

JOHOR BARU: Johor has the highest number of unsold completed properties in Malaysia over the last two years with 6,066 units left without buyers.
State Housing, Communications and Multimedia Committee chairman Dzulkefly Ahmad said the combined value of these units amounted to RM4.068bil.“Nearly 60% of these units are priced at RM500,000 and above.
 
“High-rise properties, priced at RM500,000 and above, make up 35.25% or 1,278 of the unsold units,” he said after attending the Johor Affordable Housing open voting ceremony in Persada International Convention Centre yesterday.
Dzulkefly said Perak was in second spot with 5,357 units (RM1.632bil), followed by Selangor, 4,693 units (RM4.2bil); Penang, 3,502 units (RM3.088bil) and Kedah, 3,311 units (RM889.54mil).
 
He said in 2017, there were 4,376 unsold completed properties worth RM2.859bil throughout the state.
He added that the number showed developers needed to focus on producing more affordable houses below the RM500,000 threshold.“Developers need to analyse the current property market in the state before building to reduce the overhang,” he said.
Dzulkefly said the state government, through its Housing Secre­ta­riat, would focus on finding ways to ensure that unsold completed residential units under the Johor Affor­d­able Homes would be sold immediately.

Johor has 6000 unsold homes?
 
The population of Johor is 4 million.
 
If 3000 couples a year get married and need a new home
 
the 6000 will be cleared in 2 years.
 
Doesn't sound a lot to me.
 
By comparison Singapore has 35,000 unsold home.

Not sure these data from which source but surely the situation there is bad. Personally i don't think you can compare property there with Singapore,  all i also agree ours are equally bad bad at least can still command some rent. Try renting out your apartment in JB.

The supply in JB can be switched on very fast as the developers usually hold large tracts of undeveloped land.  Hence, the potential supply is large compared to Singapore.
 
JB should have easily 50,000 unsold units if the Chinese developments are factored in.  While the condo prices are still falling, the landed prices have stabilised and the new ones in good areas are actually increasing in prices.

I plantation can convert to massive housing. There are plenty of land if there is demand. If you look at their condo and shopping malls, just a few years after completion, badly maintained and poor control. Don't have a strong authority to govern the running of private properties there. Local therefore prefer landed and self manage.

Iskandar Malaysia Property Investments – 5 Reasons Why They’re a Bad IdeaBy aaron loyJanuary 3, 20151982Share:Image Source: http://www.iskandarm...evelopment-planA few months back, I entertained the thought of buying a property in Iskandar Malaysia, either as a home for myself, or as a rental property. The relatively weak Malaysian Ringgit makes it a very enticing proposition, but while personal factors (like location of friends, lack of personal transport and poor internet infrastructure) ruled out my using the property as a home, I also quickly realized that it’s also a very bad idea to buy one as an investment.Now, I don’t pretend to be an expert in property investmenting, but what I do have however, are insights as the son of a real estate agent, and my penchant for (overly?) anal-analytical thinking.So why is investing in Properties in Iskandar Malaysia currently a bad idea? Here are some of my reasons:1. Limits on ForeignersThere are 2 parts to this.The 1st one, which is arguably superficial, is that in every project, certain units are always reserved for the local Malay populace. There are informally called ‘Bumi Units’, named after the ‘Bumiputera‘, the policy. You can read more about it here.In practice, you’ll find that some of the best units will not be available for purchase because you’re not a local Malay. An annoyance for those buying for yourselves, though probably not as big of an issue if you’re planning to rent the place (There are of course loopholes to get around the problem, but we’ll focus on the ‘official’ stuff only, yea?).The most important thing though, is that foreigners are only allowed to buy property above a certain limit. It was RM500,000, and as of 3rd March’14, it has been raised to RM1,000,000.Understandably, this is to prevent rapid rise in prices due to over-speculation, which is a good thing for the locals. As an investor however, this will be a problem for your exit strategy, which we’ll talk about later.2. Are Businesses Moving In? Who are your Tenants?Iskandar Malaysia is being sold as a holistic nirvana where anybody can work, play, and live a balanced life.Be that as it may, there’s 1 fundamental a lot of new investors miss when they’re considering an investment here; Are businesses moving in?Think about it. In any new town, businesses must set up shop first before the people (employees of these businesses) move in. I’m not sure that’s the case with this region.The next time you bring yourself and/or your family along to Johor for your shopping and seafood, keep your eyes open and pay attention to the commercial spaces. Are the shops doing well? Are their customers mostly locals or weekender Singaporeans? Where are the offices, warehouses and other non-retail spaces? Are they filled or mostly empty? etc.This is important information because you need to figure out who’s going to rent your property and if there’s demand. From what I see so far, demand from local business staff is extremely low.The other side of this argument is that because of the increasing cost of living in Singapore, more people will starting living cross-causeway livelihoods, working in Singapore while staying in Johor. A valid point, I concede, but honestly, when will the demand start to rise?How many are willing to spend the extra time, at least twice a day, 5 times a week, enduring traffic jams going to and fro work via the check points? Until Singapore and Malaysia stop bickering and solve this fundamental logistical issue can large scale cross-causeway livelihoods become a reality. This, and the recent measures to (finally) increase supply of houses in Singapore, means that most people will still opt to stay here.So, who’s going to rent your property?3. Competition Against Other InvestorsI shall attempt to figure out why you’re thinking of investing in Iskandar Malaysia with the help of my crystal ball… let’s see now…. mmmm……. ahhh… I see…:1. You’re new to property investing2. Malaysia is still ‘familiar’ territory compared to, say, the Philippines or Vietnam3. Properties in Malaysia are much cheaper than those in Singapore (2.5x cheaper sial!)4. No Money Down (It seems like the Malaysian government is cracking down on this loophole though)…. close?Hey, don’t take it personally. Knowing yourself is half the battle won yes? I’m in the same boat as you =)With that done… do you see a problem?We’ve already established that rental demand isn’t exactly hot in that area right now, yes? And yet, it seems like housing in Iskandar is (or was?) selling quite well, and I suspect, to those with the same mindset as you and me.So, not only do we have questionable demand, but we also seem to have an oversupply of new wannabe ‘investors’ trying to rent as well, which means there will be a large supply of rental properties in the market, and a large supple would mean lower rentals and a lower return on investment, isn’t it?Mmmm… Singapore Dollars looking Delicious4. Cheap Investment?One of my pet peeves is that the word ‘cheap’ is often misused. It’s often used to denote ‘low priced’ when it should mean ‘low for its price’ instead. Let’s put it this way, buying a $1,000,000 sports car that costs $2,000,000 to make is ‘cheap’, while $7.90 for the same nail clipper that can be bought for $2 at a pasar malam (night market) is called ‘expensive’. Price ≠ Actual Value.Anyway…A similar problem plagues the mindset of the wannabe investors who are exploring the possibility of investing in Iskandarian properties; They (or We, I should say) feel that these projects are ‘cheap’ because they’re ‘cheaper’ than properties in Singapore.In my opinion, Iskandar Malaysia is, especially their residential projects, in effect, like Batam Island, in that they’re made to cater to Singaporean cash cows who are willing to be milked. In other words, most of it is hype, with inflated prices and an excess of fake demand.5. Exit Strategy?Let’s say, for whatever reason, the time has come for you to sell this property of yours. Now, before we talk about making or losing money, let’s talk about the 2 primary factors that will effect your ability to do so:The RM1,000,000 lower purchase limit on foreigners, and the fact that most properties launched are priced between RM500,000 and RM1,000,000.Oops.You have to remember that these projects are not made to be affordable for the locals; They’re there to maximize profits from foreigners (read: Singaporeans) with cash to spare. So, unless the government lowers the limit or there’s a miracle spike in property prices, the limit effectively eliminates all foreigners as potential buyers for your property.How can you sell.. when there are no buyers?Conclusion1. Limits on foreigners that limits choices.2. A practically non-existent rental market.3. Competing against a large pool of ‘investors’ for a small pool of tenants.4. Bad value for money.5. Effectively, no way out of this investment.Honestly, all one needs to do is to ask some simple questions and do a little research to know that investing in Iskandar Malaysian properties is, at best, a questionable move to make. There are too many things working against you and expecting any of those factors to change is almost akin to gambling, hoping for a good card to appear.Investing may be a game, but it’s a game you want to win by making informed choices.There’s a word for taking chances and hoping for the best: Gambling.At the moment, in my humble opinion, the local government and the property developers made a killing while the ultimate losers are those who bought units before the limit increased to RM1,000,000. These people are stuck with a property that’s extremely difficult sell or rent to break even, much less make a profit out of.Here’s the thing though; There IS a potential for that place. After all, with the cost of living in Singapore on the rise and its government’s penchant for taking short-cuts to solve its population problem, an increasing number of people will consider staying around Iskandar Malaysia as a permanent compromise between convenience and lower cost of living.That being said, I believe that the potential will only be realised in the relatively far future, and things will only get much worst before it becomes a viable investment option.I hope this ‘layman’s’ take on the subject has given some insight into the topic. Remember to share this post, especially with those who are considering a purchase in the area.Do check out another take on the same topic @ Dr Wealth: Iskandar Malaysia is Only Going One Way – Down. Research is always important, yes?http://www.theaaronl...yre-a-bad-idea/

If 99-year LH condos in Singapore continue to move towards $2,000 psf within the next 10 year (next batch in OCRs that are launching next year is moving towards $1,500 psf), it could re-ignite demand for freehold properties in Iskandar Johor.

If planning to move and live and work there, maybe can buy.  Otherwise it will be more a burden than aything. Hard to rent out, don't go and stay once in a while sayang. Go also ley cher having to spend hours and hours at the customs.

Iskandar Malaysia Property Investments – 5 Reasons Why They’re a Bad Idea

Image Source: http://www.iskandarm...evelopment-plan
A few months back, I entertained the thought of buying a property in Iskandar Malaysia, either as a home for myself, or as a rental property. The relatively weak Malaysian Ringgit makes it a very enticing proposition, but while personal factors (like location of friends, lack of personal transport and poor internet infrastructure) ruled out my using the property as a home, I also quickly realized that it’s also a very bad idea to buy one as an investment.
Now, I don’t pretend to be an expert in property investmenting, but what I do have however, are insights as the son of a real estate agent, and my penchant for (overly?) anal-analytical thinking.
So why is investing in Properties in Iskandar Malaysia currently a bad idea? Here are some of my reasons:
 
1. Limits on Foreigners
There are 2 parts to this.
The 1st one, which is arguably superficial, is that in every project, certain units are always reserved for the local Malay populace. There are informally called ‘Bumi Units’, named after the ‘Bumiputera‘, the policy. You can read more about it here.
In practice, you’ll find that some of the best units will not be available for purchase because you’re not a local Malay. An annoyance for those buying for yourselves, though probably not as big of an issue if you’re planning to rent the place (There are of course loopholes to get around the problem, but we’ll focus on the ‘official’ stuff only, yea?).
The most important thing though, is that foreigners are only allowed to buy property above a certain limit. It was RM500,000, and as of 3rd March’14, it has been raised to RM1,000,000.
Understandably, this is to prevent rapid rise in prices due to over-speculation, which is a good thing for the locals. As an investor however, this will be a problem for your exit strategy, which we’ll talk about later.
 
2. Are Businesses Moving In? Who are your Tenants?
Iskandar Malaysia is being sold as a holistic nirvana where anybody can work, play, and live a balanced life.
Be that as it may, there’s 1 fundamental a lot of new investors miss when they’re considering an investment here; Are businesses moving in?
Think about it. In any new town, businesses must set up shop first before the people (employees of these businesses) move in. I’m not sure that’s the case with this region.
The next time you bring yourself and/or your family along to Johor for your shopping and seafood, keep your eyes open and pay attention to the commercial spaces. Are the shops doing well? Are their customers mostly locals or weekender Singaporeans? Where are the offices, warehouses and other non-retail spaces? Are they filled or mostly empty? etc.
This is important information because you need to figure out who’s going to rent your property and if there’s demand. From what I see so far, demand from local business staff is extremely low.
The other side of this argument is that because of the increasing cost of living in Singapore, more people will starting living cross-causeway livelihoods, working in Singapore while staying in Johor. A valid point, I concede, but honestly, when will the demand start to rise?
How many are willing to spend the extra time, at least twice a day, 5 times a week, enduring traffic jams going to and fro work via the check points? Until Singapore and Malaysia stop bickering and solve this fundamental logistical issue can large scale cross-causeway livelihoods become a reality. This, and the recent measures to (finally) increase supply of houses in Singapore, means that most people will still opt to stay here.
So, who’s going to rent your property?
 
3. Competition Against Other Investors
I shall attempt to figure out why you’re thinking of investing in Iskandar Malaysia with the help of my crystal ball… let’s see now…. mmmm……. ahhh… I see…:
1. You’re new to property investing
2. Malaysia is still ‘familiar’ territory compared to, say, the Philippines or Vietnam
3. Properties in Malaysia are much cheaper than those in Singapore (2.5x cheaper sial!)
4. No Money Down (It seems like the Malaysian government is cracking down on this loophole though)
…. close?
Hey, don’t take it personally. Knowing yourself is half the battle won yes? I’m in the same boat as you =)
With that done… do you see a problem?
We’ve already established that rental demand isn’t exactly hot in that area right now, yes? And yet, it seems like housing in Iskandar is (or was?) selling quite well, and I suspect, to those with the same mindset as you and me.
So, not only do we have questionable demand, but we also seem to have an oversupply of new wannabe ‘investors’ trying to rent as well, which means there will be a large supply of rental properties in the market, and a large supple would mean lower rentals and a lower return on investment, isn’t it?

Mmmm… Singapore Dollars looking Delicious
4. Cheap Investment?
One of my pet peeves is that the word ‘cheap’ is often misused. It’s often used to denote ‘low priced’ when it should mean ‘low for its price’ instead. Let’s put it this way, buying a $1,000,000 sports car that costs $2,000,000 to make is ‘cheap’, while $7.90 for the same nail clipper that can be bought for $2 at a pasar malam (night market) is called ‘expensive’. Price ≠ Actual Value.
Anyway…
A similar problem plagues the mindset of the wannabe investors who are exploring the possibility of investing in Iskandarian properties; They (or We, I should say) feel that these projects are ‘cheap’ because they’re ‘cheaper’ than properties in Singapore.
In my opinion, Iskandar Malaysia is, especially their residential projects, in effect, like Batam Island, in that they’re made to cater to Singaporean cash cows who are willing to be milked. In other words, most of it is hype, with inflated prices and an excess of fake demand.
 
5. Exit Strategy?
Let’s say, for whatever reason, the time has come for you to sell this property of yours. Now, before we talk about making or losing money, let’s talk about the 2 primary factors that will effect your ability to do so:
The RM1,000,000 lower purchase limit on foreigners, and the fact that most properties launched are priced between RM500,000 and RM1,000,000.
Oops.
You have to remember that these projects are not made to be affordable for the locals; They’re there to maximize profits from foreigners (read: Singaporeans) with cash to spare. So, unless the government lowers the limit or there’s a miracle spike in property prices, the limit effectively eliminates all foreigners as potential buyers for your property.
How can you sell.. when there are no buyers?
 
Conclusion
1. Limits on foreigners that limits choices.
2. A practically non-existent rental market.
3. Competing against a large pool of ‘investors’ for a small pool of tenants.
4. Bad value for money.
5. Effectively, no way out of this investment.
Honestly, all one needs to do is to ask some simple questions and do a little research to know that investing in Iskandar Malaysian properties is, at best, a questionable move to make. There are too many things working against you and expecting any of those factors to change is almost akin to gambling, hoping for a good card to appear.
Investing may be a game, but it’s a game you want to win by making informed choices.
There’s a word for taking chances and hoping for the best: Gambling.
At the moment, in my humble opinion, the local government and the property developers made a killing while the ultimate losers are those who bought units before the limit increased to RM1,000,000. These people are stuck with a property that’s extremely difficult sell or rent to break even, much less make a profit out of.
Here’s the thing though; There IS a potential for that place. After all, with the cost of living in Singapore on the rise and its government’s penchant for taking short-cuts to solve its population problem, an increasing number of people will consider staying around Iskandar Malaysia as a permanent compromise between convenience and lower cost of living.
That being said, I believe that the potential will only be realised in the relatively far future, and things will only get much worst before it becomes a viable investment option.
I hope this ‘layman’s’ take on the subject has given some insight into the topic. Remember to share this post, especially with those who are considering a purchase in the area.
Do check out another take on the same topic @ Dr Wealth: Iskandar Malaysia is Only Going One Way – Down. Research is always important, yes?

A lot of investors bought condos in JB including those with 99 years or 129 years lease 4-7 years ago.
 
It is difficult to flip condos in JB for a profit as land is quite cheap and plentiful.

If really want to stay in Malaysia to lower expenditure during retirement, might be better to rent instead of buying a property there.
 
Can rent out the house in Singapore and then pay the cheaper rental in Malaysia.  Should have some positive cash.

I am a regular to JB once upon a time. Due to the jams, i refrain going in. Frankly, i didn't find the condition that bad. 9f course if you try to test market, then you are asking for trouble.
 
I also agree, Singapore is a much safer place.  When economy is bad, people resort to all sort of things to survive. If they are comfortable,  why would they even bother to steal? Once upon a time, you tell Singaporean there will be free newspapers,  people say you are crazy.

With a stroke of the pen, anything or everything can change.
 
Right or wrong, fair or unfair, 8 years or 18 years  its still their rules and regulations. If suddenly want to tighten or enforce by the letter and chop, oso must obey. 
 
Unless...nvm. Dun even think about bribery. U did not see me suggesting it. Nope. I did not. Stay above it.
 
Thanks for sharing. Hope its not fake news.

If they enforce consistently. Surely singaporean people will comply. Its just a matter of being clear and consistent with application of their policies or law. 
Agreed if they reject you if u don't have the proper paperwork, then u need to get it. 
Malaysians come Singapore work no work permit ah?? Singaporeans stay in JB got what permit??I dunno if they need a special permit or pass. If it's made clear to those living there. Why wouldn't they comply?If the prev officers never check in the first place, then obviously thousands of people won't bother to comply. 
 
People are lazy by nature. U can tell 100 people 10x need to have this pass and start first Jan. But u still get people who bo chap or just plain forgot.

It will be good for Singapore government to make all Malaysians working in Singapore to stay in Singapore.
 
Landlords, transport providers, retailers etc will have a booming business and the 1st and 2nd links will be very clear.
 
The government will earn from the additional taxes and hence, lower taxes for Singapore citizens.

If add this pool into the demand, the delicate balance will be disrupted once again. Rental and price index will shoot through the roof.

What is stopping these work permit holders/ PR residing in JB from renting /buying a place and staying in SG?   
Besides family link, cost is probably a big factor. More staying here, border crossing will be worse on Fridays and weekends. All balik kampong.
 
Our govt don't really want factory workers earning $1-2k a month to stay in SG, the limited rooms we have here are reserved for those earning >6k (can bring spouse) and >12k (can import parents too).  We even want to send our poor aged and sick to JB nursing homes.  Lol

now renting out 1 room already can smelly smelly make $600 in hdb
imagine with the spike in demands .... 1 room can make $800-$1000
more sinkies will hold on to hdb and cheong private (which is already happening but dampen by ABSD)
if the monthly rental yield is good ... ABSD cost is simply transferred to tenant
spore property price will shoot through the galaxy to mars
sekali more and more hdb got 8-10 rooms in the unit 
with 6 legal tenants + ghosts

My condo senior security guard travels in daily from JB on his bike. JB is where his family lives. The $2.5k he makes here, when converted to MYR is $7.5k in Malaysia. This more than what a manager earns in a big Malaysia city. If he is forced to stay in SG and pay for a room, food and petrol, this will result in take home pay reduction of SGD1k. No longer attractive to work here and we will be short of guards, technicians, free-lance tilers and skilled construction workers.
 
Work here, spend in MY is best of both worlds even after factor in traffic at Causeway. My guard goes home and drives his luxury car around JB after work .

https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/09/20/johor-govt-mulls-lowering-rm1mil-threshold-for-property-acquisition-by-foreigners


	JOHOR BARU: The Johor government is looking at lowering the current RM1mil threshold for foreigners to buy property as an incentive to sell off 51,000 unsold properties in the state.
	State Housing, Communication and Multimedia Committee chairman Dzulkefly Ahmad (pic) said that properties priced at RM600,000 and above make up between 60% and 70% of unsold properties here.
	"Among the incentives that we are looking at is to review the RM1mil threshold of property prices for foreigners to buy property in Johor.
	"The matter will be reviewed by the state Land and Mines Office as the matter comes under their jurisdiction," he said when met at a property fair held at a shopping mall here on Friday (Sept 20).
	The Kota Iskandar assemblyman however assured that the lowering of the minimum threshold would not increase property prices for locals.
	The measure was introduced by the previous administration to stabilise domestic prices from excessive speculation to enable local interests to acquire quality properties valued less than RM1mil per unit, especially residential units.

	I visit MY very frequent and have many MY relatives and friends recommendations.


	Most of them advise to rent as the rental is very attractive. Also knowing, the lack of building facilities management in MY and result gloomy property within 5-6yrs


	IMO, if you rent out your SG apartment and rent in MY, probably the passive income can support your retirement age.

	At the rate the Singapore private properties are increasing prices, the freehold landed properties in Johor are still an attractive alternative for the lower middle to the middle class in Singapore.  However, I won't recommend them as property investment and never ever buy a condominium in Johor.


	Generally, the prices are around S$250-350k for a freehold property, which is about double the price of a car in Singapore with a 10-year lifespan.  In terms of timing for value-for-money, 2019-2020 is probably the trough of these properties that had seen their peaks in 2013-2014.


	The better and more affordable ones that I know of are at the following:


West of 1st link


	Bukit Indah - near mega malls and eateries


	East Ledang - a tranquil area with greenery


	Eco Botanic - excellent landscaping and quality


	Horizon Hills - within an integrated with golf course and many Singaporean owners


East of 1st link


	Austin Heights - near lots of eateries and schools


	Desa Tebrau - near mega malls and schools


	Senibong Cove - next to relaxing coastal area

	It is very sad to see these people any-o-how invest property, based on following the herds. A RM 1million condo is way over priced in Malaysia.Worst still for those who bought into attractive township sold by various developers. Is not that we better to invest in Malaysia properties. I have seen people invest in Singapore condos, but ended up unable to get rental yields to cover the loan and maintenance of property.  Is all about how to invest property in a well-thought of the downsides, rather than looking forward the upsides. I have a few friends that managed this well, due to their experience in Malaysia JB properties. Here are some advise for those who want to invest in Malaysia properties :


1. Never buy condo for more than RM500k. Average local middle income earnings, that is the limit. This is to allow you to sell not only to foreigners, but to locals too.


2. Buy into smaller number of units of a development. For example , not more than a few hundred units.


3. This said development , must be near many eateries and supermarkets serving mainly nearby critical mass of residents in mature estates that is already supporting the shops.  But not the large shopping malls around that may in-turn make the place too noisy with traffic jams. This naturally becomes an unsafe place, where all kinds of people coming around. 


4. The development must not be near to many other developments with huge number of units. It have to be mature development around. 


5. Development that is near 10 - 15 mins drive to major industrial with many MNCs. If there is an airhub better still. But do ensure flights does not fly over the development, and is of a distance 8km -10km away.  


6. Hitting expressways of not more than 10 - 15 mins away.


	Singapore property have own set of problems. Majority condo developments are targeted mass market. Many have flocked in between 2013 - 2016, paying as high as 900k of a 450 Square feet unit. How they find it hard to rent out, or rent at negative yield after all loans and maintenance deducted. Those who bought bigger units are also facing near negative yield after all loans and maintenance deducted, as of today. This group of property investors are mostly middle income earnings, praying that they don't lost their jobs, and sleepless nights for those on tight cash flows.


	So don't follow the crowd. This have been the biggest weakness in human. I have to do much leg job and homework. Always look at the downside first, follow-by upside will take care of itself. Ever it things turn bad, one is already prepare with enough buffer ahead, by not throwing large investment blindly.

	That's extremely good advice here. I was lucky that I got my "investment" place when the market was low and my cousin who I had engaged as my agent, walked me through all the downsides of investing in a mass market condo. Once I had accepted the risks, she then walk me through and which are to focus on where I can at least maintain the purchase price.


	Example: 5 mins walk to MRT, maturity level of the estate, what amenities are there in the estate, etc.


	I did a lot of homework myself by walking around the estate, taking a 5 mins drive around the area and reading up on the area. I think that's something most "investors" should do so that they can gauge if the area is good for rental.


	Back to the Johor topic, my cousin bought a few of these "excellent investment" properties and have regretted the idea. Now these houses has been converted into holiday homes as they can't be rented out nor sell to the locals as they are "too exp". I now take the opportunity to stay at her holiday home. Haha

	Just an add-on. Find out who are the future new owner are. Mainly locals or foreigners or investors? If you have many foreigners/local investors buying the development, this is a bug-bear if one plan to rent out.   One should not buy into more than RM500k investment and expect to rent out to locals. Who will rent such a expensive unit?  Unless there are MNCs corporate willing to rent for their upper management teams that is contracted to work nearby MNCs for few years, that may enable to rent out to. 


	I know is a difficult job to look around and need a pair of strong legs. A few may able to find yields as high as 7% to 9% in Malaysia. Every country have a way or 2 to invest in properties. It is how, one knows the market of it's own. So if those who are comfortable to just for the 2% or less yield, than Singapore is the way to go. Unless one really uncovers gem like property, which is a tough fight with so many investors going for the same pie. This eventually, leads to thinning of yields, and barely have any buffer if things turns.

5. Development that is near 10 - 15 mins drive to major industrial with many MNCs. If there is an airhub better still. But do ensure flights does not fly over the development, and is of a distance 8km -10km away.  


6. Hitting expressways of not more than 10 - 15 mins away.
		

			Singapore property have own set of problems. Majority condo developments are targeted mass market. Many have flocked in between 2013 - 2016, paying as high as 900k of a 450 Square feet unit. How they find it hard to rent out, or rent at negative yield after all loans and maintenance deducted. Those who bought bigger units are also facing near negative yield after all loans and maintenance deducted, as of today. This group of property investors are mostly middle income earnings, praying that they don't lost their jobs, and sleepless nights for those on tight cash flows.
		

			So don't follow the crowd. This have been the biggest weakness in human. I have to do much leg job and homework. Always look at the downside first, follow-by upside will take care of itself. Ever it things turn bad, one is already prepare with enough buffer ahead, by not throwing large investment blindly.   
		



	Sounds like good advice. Advising people not to take loan always sound like good advice.


	But with critical blind spots.


	The current local state is purposefully managed by the Govt. They try to minimise the number of people getting windfall and ending the game. But standing on their side is never a bad thing. The local game can also change anytime the Govt needs to change it. One tweak coming is loosening of monetary policy to be announced next week.


	Moreover, negative yields only truly happen if one pays 20% and loans 80%, plus get a property priced far above its comparable. Try paying 30-40% and loaning 60-70% instead. For the really rich, they can pay up 100% and not have it caveated. Back to the middle income, rent still far far exceeds interests and maintenance paid.
	For Johor properties, on top of all the problems, there is also currency depreciation to be concerned about if one decides to pay up a large % of down payment.

	The RM $1 mil restriction was poorly implemented. Now the government regretted and reversed the decision. However, it is too late.

	because buy resale means the 1st taste of the soup already taken by the 1st owner ..


	pay higher and take much longer to recover or even make a profit


	and when you find a cheap deal ... must check 3x why it is cheap ... cheap for a reason


	to find a good valid awesome deal ... you must be sibei experience with a lot of time to research


	or you get a tok kong agent with handsome commission ...


	that’s why

	Johor buy offers an outlet for us, and it is good to have.


	Will be interesting to compare buying three units of Johor property (600 or 700K SGD) versus one MM unit (also 600-700K SGD) in SG, and tracking the similarities and differences over time.


	From my interactions with colleagues who are renting out in Malaysia, the main concern is tenant quality. All kinds of scary stories.


	Appreciation, Mortgage, maintenance effort and quality - anyone has time to do a detailed comparison?

	The condos around Legoland and gleneagles medini not too bad. Stayed at nice 30+ floor Airbnb instead of Legoland hotel. Much cheaper. But can't see the mall downstairs filling up soon. Too much competition for retail space.

			It is very sad to see these people any-o-how invest property, based on following the herds. A RM 1million condo is way over priced in Malaysia.Worst still for those who bought into attractive township sold by various developers. Is not that we better to invest in Malaysia properties. I have seen people invest in Singapore condos, but ended up unable to get rental yields to cover the loan and maintenance of property.  Is all about how to invest property in a well-thought of the downsides, rather than looking forward the upsides. I have a few friends that managed this well, due to their experience in Malaysia JB properties. Here are some advise for those who want to invest in Malaysia properties :


1. Never buy condo for more than RM500k. Average local middle income earnings, that is the limit. This is to allow you to sell not only to foreigners, but to locals too.


2. Buy into smaller number of units of a development. For example , not more than a few hundred units.


3. This said development , must be near many eateries and supermarkets serving mainly nearby critical mass of residents in mature estates that is already supporting the shops.  But not the large shopping malls around that may in-turn make the place too noisy with traffic jams. This naturally becomes an unsafe place, where all kinds of people coming around. 


4. The development must not be near to many other developments with huge number of units. It have to be mature development around. 


5. Development that is near 10 - 15 mins drive to major industrial with many MNCs. If there is an airhub better still. But do ensure flights does not fly over the development, and is of a distance 8km -10km away.  


6. Hitting expressways of not more than 10 - 15 mins away.

	All very true but where is the good area to buy?


	If good location, good price, good development, good everything also all sold out.


	Got such thing as good location, good price, good development, good everything and still available?




	Anyone also can give good advice.


	If buy condo in Singapore buy near MRT, buy where got renters paying top dollar, buy in prime area, buy at cheap cheap price. Buy where can sell at double the profit.


	The only question is where got such as good condo?
