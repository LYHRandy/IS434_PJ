	If they are interested in a global hub that has strong links to both China and US, they will come.


	If their wealthy comes, it will be a good half year before the numbers show up on the stats. Even signing OTP and lodging caveat needs several months.


	Most likely, it’s more feasible to rent first, apply for PR or citizenship, to be eligible to buy HDB or to lower or eradicate ABSD payment to buy private property.


	I wish all the best for HK though.

	Quite sad to see HK in such a state, but I do get what they're fighting for.


	Our property prices are not 'cheap', only those who can afford will come here, others will go for cheaper alternatives elsewhere.


	Yes, wish HK and the HK people all the best.

	There are quite a lot of upgraders selling their HDBs to buy condominiums.  The low % of SERS has determined that most HDBs are going to $0 value at the end of the lease.  Hence, many upgraders are bailing out while there is still value in their HDB.


Don't assume all old HDB flats will become eligible for Sers, cautions Lawrence Wong

	With global uncertainty, more to be coming here to park for 'safe haven' ...unspecified could be some other countries combined, not the usual asian region. 😉


https://sbr.com.sg/residential-property/in-focus/ultra-rich-foreigners-scramble-luxury-homes-in-singapore





Foreign ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) investors are expected to drive sales activity in Singapore's luxury residential segment as geopolitical tensions in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom enhance the attractiveness of posh homes in the city state.

	In early July, British billionaire James Dyson snapped up the Wallich Residence super penthouse for a record $73.8m. The 21,108-sqft, triplex super penthouse occupying the 62nd to 64th floor of the Guoco Tower is reportedly the largest penthouse and the highest residence in Singapore. Two weeks later, Dyson purchased another luxury home, a hilltop Good Class Bungalow (GCB) located along Cluny Road with views of the Botanic Gardens, for $41m.


	More recently, a sprawling 84,543-sqft GCB plot in the prestigious Nassim Road area was sold for a record $230m or about $2,721 psf. It was formerly owned by Cheng Wai Keung, the Chairman of Wing Tai Holdings, and his wife Helen. Whilst the buyer is reported to be trustee company SG Casa, media has speculated that the buying party was Eduardo Saverin, the co-founder of Facebook. 


Joining the elite list of affluent individuals with residences in Singapore is Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba’s co-founder Jack Ma, who reportedly purchased a 30,000-sqft site at Victoria Park Close, where he is said to be building a two-storey bungalow with a basement and swimming pool.


"Singapore's solid economic fundamentals, sound financial framework, ease of doing business, quality education and racial harmony continue to make it one of the choice locations for potential foreign investors."

	Thanks for reading 👍👍👍

	Its all about affordability,  with PSF on the up, over the years developers have been shrinking unit sizes to remain within buyer sweet spot.


	Made worse with CMs- TDSR/LTV/ABSD,  that buyers today have to content with, further reducing buyer unit size affordability.


	Thats also why we have ahgong recent intervention on min unit size requirements. 😉

	Amazing psf of yesteryear


	Just 14 years which is not that long ago - (2,024-sq-ft unit $488,000 ($241 psf) in October 2005) 


Seller sold for 4X the buy price ... where to find today? 


https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/three-bedroom-unit-balmoral-8-rakes-148-mil-profit




The 2,024-sq-ft unit on the second floor was sold for $1.98 million ($954 psf) on Aug 20, but had been bought for $488,000 ($241 psf) in October 2005. Thus, the seller walked away with a $1.44 million profit.

	From affordable point of view I agree but that’s like saying I need a 7 seater for my family but I can afford a Korean n probably should be okay to squeeze 6 person with two small kids.. 


	i ratger go with practical aspect and Apple for Apple consideration. Else the shoe box appt does make good sense for s family of 6 if you squeeze it as the home is only use for sleeping...

	Doubt so, as the % will be low to be any significant, not many tenants wanna move every few months.


	One reason is displaced enbloc sellers, either waiting brand new BUC/ enbloc funds/ transaction completion/ renovations etc.




Local movement by owners and tenants in residential projects that were sold successfully through collective sales reportedly continue to contribute a substantial portion of leasing demand,

https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/real-estate/share-of-new-condo-units-priced-under-s1m-fall-to-24-in-q2-report


	Share of new condo units priced under S$1m fall to 24% in Q2





UNIT prices of new condominiums in Singapore trended higher in the second quarter of this year, with the proportion of apartments priced under S$1 million falling to 24 per cent of new units sold, from 37 per cent in the first quarter.

For resale properties, unit price ranges remained relatively stable quarter-on-quarter, other than a rise in the proportion of resale and larger sized units priced above S$3 million to 11 per cent in Q2, from 8 per cent the quarter before. 


Sell-down rates of new projects in the second quarter ranged from 1.7 per cent to 48.9 per cent. Sky Everton achieving the highest sell down rate, followed by Parc Komo at 37.7 per cent. Overall average sell-down rate improved to 19 per cent, from 10.7 per cent the previous quarter.


	Outlook for the private housing market in the second half of 2019 remains "cautiously optimistic",  as it stuck to its forecast of 8,000 to 10,000 in sales of new units for 2019.  Prices are largely expected to remain stable with a 3 per cent upside.


	"With new project launches expected to pick up in H2 2019 amid strong headwinds from a slowing local economy, ongoing trade tensions between mainland China and USA, Japan and Korea, and the political situation in Hong Kong, demand for non-landed units from foreign buyers may pick up, as Singapore is viewed as a safe investment haven despite the current property curbs,"

https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/hub-projects/property-2019-september-issue/ecs-have-a-pivotal-role-to-play-in-the-mass-market


	ECs have a pivotal role to play in the mass market





with the lack of new launches for ECs, this has led to a rise in prices for ECs as well. In recent times, EC prices have started to cross the S$1,000 psf mark. Using Rivercove Residences as an example, the highest transacted unit price for the development was in April 2018. A unit on level 16 with a size of 89 sq m (958 sq ft) was sold for S$1,086 psf. With the recent transactions of Rivercove Residences in 2019, many units transacted at the S$1,000 psf mark as well.

Furthermore, according to the data retrieved from URA Realis on July 9, 2019, the median price of new ECs increased from S$941 psf (1Q19) to S$1,003 psf (2Q19). This was a 6.5 per cent (q-o-q) price change.





With EC prices starting to form the new benchmark, a lack of supply of ECs will cause mass market private property prices to continue to rise. Thus, from an affordability perspective, Singaporeans who are aiming for their first private home will face a tough hurdle in achieving that dream.

Singapore saw new condo sales volume rose 30.6 percent quarter-on-quarter to 2,246 units in the second quarter of 2019, while resale volume climbed 18.2 percent to 1,966 units.


	This brings total sales volume for Q2 to 4,212 units or the highest since Q3 2018 when the government rolled additional cooling measures.

Mr Wong also announced another change: The income ceiling for Singaporean households to buy new flats and ECs will be raised by $2,000 - to $14,000 and $16,000 respectively.

Since the last income ceiling rise four years ago, incomes have risen, said Mr Wong, adding that more Singaporeans should be allowed to qualify.

A trade creditor has thrown a spanner in the works for the Sycamore Tree residential project, potentially dragging 180-odd jaded home buyers including those of a related project at Laurel Tree into a protracted nightmare delay just when progress is being made to complete the units.


	On Aug 20, unsecured creditor, Jay Machinery Pte Ltd filed a winding up application in Singapore's High Court against Astoria Development, the developer of the 96 residential units and 17 shops in the Sycamore Tree project in Joo Chiat which went bust. Astoria owes Jay Machinery S$1.3 million. The court hearing is scheduled to be heard on Friday, Sept 13, 2019.


	When a company is being liquidated, its assets are collected and sold off to pay debts by an independent liquidator whose powers and duties are regulated by the Companies Act (Cap 50).


	The rights of unsecured creditors (home buyers included in this case) over the company's assets are virtually "frozen" upon the commencement of the liquidation to avoid a further deterioration of the company's financial position and proliferation of its liabilities. Unsecured creditors and home buyers are paid on a pari passu basis; that is, they are paid out of the company's assets equally.


	"There is no precedent to this case at all. It is not a foregone conclusion that we buyers can get our units because in the event of an liquidation, other unsecured creditors and us are treated equally," lamented one buyer who asked not to be named. "It depends on whether the court will follow strictly the insolvency law or the Housing Developers Rule which is designed to protect buyers, when residential projects go bust before completion.''


	When a liquidator is appointed, the project account - where buyers' payments are meant to be safeguarded when they buy from licensed developers - is vested with the liquidator. The rule remains unclear in cases where there is a liquidator and a receiver in place.


	In Singapore, a developer has to open a project account to ensure that buyers' monies collected and any loans disbursed for the construction of the building project are deposited into the project account and used specifically for the housing project.


	On Tuesday, receivers for both Sycamore Tree and Laurel Tree - partners at KPMG in Singapore, led by Bob Yap, Partner, Head of Restructuring, Singapore and Head of Deal Advisory, ASPAC - told buyers at the respective townhall meetings that they remained committed to their plan to complete both developments.


	The receivers intend to file an application to the Court to seek consent to proceed with their plan to complete the project and to hand over the units to the buyers. They intend to ask the Court to regard affected home buyers differently from other unsecured creditors.


	Buyers of the two projects were given updates on the progress of a tender process to identify financially sound and quality main contractors and negotiations to determine the cost to take over and to complete the construction.


	"Since the last townhall meetings in April, the receivers have reviewed the tender offers from prospective replacement main contractors, shortlisted selected tenderers and are currently engaging them in price negotiations,'' receivers said.


	While the buyers of Laurel Tree are not directly affected by the winding up application against Astoria, receivers warned that there might be potential implication to them as the same difficulties would apply if any creditor applies to wind up Lerida, the developer of Laurel Tree, a 70-unit condo in Hillview Terrace.


	Like Sycamore Tree, Laurel Tree was supposed to get its TOP in 2016, but the project was abandoned and left uncompleted. Both Astoria and Lerida are linked to Tan Hock Keng, a former known property player and one of the "Geylang Kings" before the Asian Financial Crisis wiped out his property portfolio.


	The Business Times understands that the Controller of Housing (COH) is still in the midst of examining the project accounts of both Laurel Tree and Sycamore Tree developments to ascertain if there are any breaches of the statutory rules regulating the operations of the project accounts.


	Any breach of the regulations governing the operations of the project accounts is an offence, and offenders may be fined up to S$50,000 and/or imprisoned up to 1 year upon conviction.


	The last time Singapore witnessed a case where a developer ran into financial difficulties before project completion was when the developer of office and residential skyscraper Springleaf Tower, a subsidiary of the now defunct Ban Hin Leong Group, faced problems in the late 1990s.


	But unlike the Springleaf case, the Laurel Tree and Sycamore Tree projects involved HDB upgraders, some of whom had sold their flats and are incurring rents while waiting for the completion of their new homes.

	Property in Singapore: How do you spot a good buy





-FOCUS ON ENTRY PRICE, NOT FUTURE SELLING PRICE

-LOOK FOR VALUE, NOT CHEAPEST PRICE


-LOOK OUT FOR GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT PLANS


BE READY TO ENTER THE MARKET


	There is always a golden window of opportunity to buy an undervalued property. "However, what is good for you is usually good for everyone, meaning everyone is ready to grab it when they see one," 


	Make sure that you are ready to pounce when you see a good deal. This means knowing your financial standing and doing your loan assessment beforehand, so that you can commit easily, rather than scramble and lose an undervalued unit to someone else.


	If you find units asking for less than the current market price range, chances are you've spotted an undervalued property. But do ask yourself why they're undervalued.

	Sales of new private homes holding up in August


	(Over 1,000 units sold as changing buyer demographics over the years may be blunting the impact of inauspicious month)






The 1,468-unit Parc Clematis is the top selling private residential project, with 316 units snapped up in August (as at Sept 12). Other projects launched earlier that continued to bring in a steady stream of buyers during the month include The Florence Residences (122 units), Treasure at Tampines (93 units), Parc Botannia (60 units), Parc Esta (47 units), and executive condominium (EC) Piermont Grand (44 units).


	Based on the Urban Redevelopment Authority's (URA) Realis data (as at Sept 12), developers moved 1,122 new homes in August, excluding ECs which are a private-public hybrid. Including ECs, developers sold 1,167 units. 


	 


	"Despite the global economic uncertainties and the Chinese lunar seventh month, over 1,000 new homes were sold last month. Last month's sales volume is considered strong as it is almost on a par with July's. The month of July usually records higher than average monthly sales in a year, and the sales volume for July 2019 was the highest for this year."


	In July this year, developers moved 1,178 private homes excluding EC units, and 1,556 units, including ECs. In August last year, only 617 private homes were sold.


"Most developers avoid the lunar seventh month for project launches and as a result, sales volumes tend to be lower. However, 2019 could be the exception. The lunar seventh month ended on Aug 29, giving developers the flexibility to decide whether they should launch on the last weekend of August."


both Parc Clematis and Luxus Hills' Signature Collection were launched on that weekend, to "spectacular results".


With developers scheduling launches after the Hungry Ghost month period, "the bulk of the new sales numbers is likely to be reflected in September"


	 


	Looking ahead, falling interest rates as well as Singapore's status as a safe haven for long-term investments could keep buying sentiment positive, especially amid the ongoing US- China trade war and other uncertainties which threaten to cast a pall on the global economy.


	"Over the long term, Singapore's residential assets will continue to be perceived as safe assets and attract investors with at least a five-year investment horizon."


	projects the take-up tally for 2019 to surpass the 8,795 units scooped up in 2018.

			Developers concerned about lacklustre sales of new private homes: Redas president
		



	2020 and 2021 are likely to be very slow years for new private properties as the number of cash-rich enbloc owners dwindles and the trade war continues.


	Some developers are likely to be hit by the 25% ABSD if their units are not sold within the 5-year from the land acquisition date.


	 


Said Mr Chia: "Assuming the present rate of take-up continues, we will see a total sales volume of about 8,000+ units for the whole of 2019. Based on this take-up rate and barring any unforeseen circumstances, we would require four to five years for the market to absorb the estimated 43,000 units available for sale."

	Work both ways, if demand slows ... ah gong may reduce/remove some CMs then many will chiong again- (read sustainable property market)


	Last 'downturn' 2013-17 ...  its been shown that developers would much rather pay ABSD hold units then to lower prices for quick sales.


	As mentioned prior, CMs since 2009 many with big warchest cash rich on the sideline, so not just the recent enbloc rich.


	Next couple years if trade war/ global economy worsen,  property demand/pricss will still to be supported via the cash rich/enbloc rich/ foreign investors park 'safe' funds here etc.


	In the longer term after 5 years and up,  when the current units supply get absorbed and with reduced GLS, may see another round of enbloc fever.

	True if decent means 60-80% gains.


	It has already been preset to 2-3% annually.

	When fed increased rates my lender OCBC was quick to increase as well.


	Now that rates were cut, OCBC didn't lower my rates. 🤬


	Should I call them up to reprice now or wait for the next cut? Or will they even voluntarily reduce rates since I'm on floating plan?


	Sorry ah Abit OT 😬

	That tells us that SG is likely going to depreciate the currency again pretty soon. This will hold interest rate near 2% for next few years.


	But if authorities don’t allow depreciation, interest rates will fall. 


	Holding an asset / assets, just sit and watch show will do. International news also interesting to watch.

	Yup, can't expect previous high gains within same duration as investment climate change with CMs, now ah gong take an upfront cut of 12-15% profit 😛 lol


	Thats why I've always said ... 'SG property, always ideal to stay vested'


	Those previously vested ... not only capital appreciation, no ABSD, higher rental yield on lower psf/price, potential future enbloc windfall etc ... HUAT

	Every individual differs, do what suit you best ... pending your HL package, interest rates, floating or fixed, any lock in period penalty etc.


	If reprice there'll be repricing fee ( few hundreds), if refinance legal fees (couple thousands), eating into the savings when change package, so gotta work your sums to see if worthwhile to change now or later,  to floating or fixed etc ... current is still around 2%-ish.


	But I'm sure you are 'old hand' 'lao jiao' and savvy,  no need me to tell you all these😉

	I normally prefer not to share personal details but give you a rough idea for mine - my HL is still at 1.65% while my FD is 1.9% current, so effectively the banks are still 'paying' me to loan with them 😛 lol 


	As mentioned prior ... 'use other ppl's (bank) money to make more money

	I feel that there is a lot of slow down in the global economy.  Hence, interest rate could fall again by the end of the year.  Lower interest rate may not be a good thing as year-end bonus is likely to be cut.

			Should I call them up to reprice now or wait for the next cut? Or will they even voluntarily reduce rates since I'm on floating plan?
		

			Sorry ah Abit OT 😬

	For 1mil i would buy resale condo full facilities 24hr security private car parking, but many are still willing to pay even above 1mil for a hdb flat.

https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/tale-of-two-cities-for-recent-condo-launches


	Tale of two cities for recent condo launches






The four projects released during the weekend before last and which saw lukewarm sales are much smaller in scale.


	Most analysts say their pricing was on the high side and, in some cases, this was due to the developers having paid high land prices towards the end of the land-buying cycle that began in mid-2016 and ended in early July 2018, when the latest round of cooling measures were announced.


	At the 99-year leasehold Cuscaden Reserve - being developed by SC Global Developments, New World Development and Far East Consortium, the median unit price of the five units sold is S$3,341 per square foot, based on data from URA Realis. This pricing level is not far off what new freehold luxe prime-district projects are commanding.


	For example, 73 units have been sold at Boulevard 88 since the project's release in March this year at a median price of S$3,662 psf. At 3 Orchard By-The-Park, the 14 units sold since July 17, 2018 went for a median price of S$3,621 psf.


	The developers of 3 Cuscaden have moved 72 units at a median price of S$3,534 psf since last November.


	There are differences among the four projects, for instance, in their median unit sizes. That said, those looking for a luxe condo property in the prime districts would mostly go for freehold.


	Cuscaden Reserve's developers clinched the site at a state tender in April 2018 for S$2,377 psf per plot ratio (psf ppr); the site drew nine bids. Analysts estimate the breakeven cost at S$3,100 psf, resulting in profit before tax margin of about 8 to 10 per cent.


	At the same tender, the developers of The Antares - a joint venture involving Hock Lian Seng Holdings, Keong Hong Holdings and TA Corporation - clinched the Mattar Road site.


	This site drew 10 bids. The S$1,109 psf ppr winning bid translates into about S$1,560 psf breakeven cost for The Antares. The profit margin is around 14 per cent.


	The S$1,794 psf median price for the 17 units sold in the first weekend is deemed too steep for a relatively untested location.


	The respective developers of The Antares and Cuscaden Reserve probably took the view that it was better to launch their projects now, despite the slim profit margin, given the substantial supply from projects in the pipeline that have yet to be launched.


	It's a slightly different story for the other two projects that saw tepid sales. The 21 units GuocoLand moved within the first week of releasing the freehold Meyer Mansion reflect a median unit price of S$2,728 psf. GuocoLand paid S$1,580 psf ppr for the site; analysts expect the breakeven cost at around S$2,200 psf - leaving a comfortable 25 per cent profit margin.


	At Uptown@Farrer, too, developer Low Keng Huat's margin is estimated at about 24 per cent. Realis data shows 12 units were sold in the first weekend at S$1,860 psf; analysts estimate the group's breakeven at around S$1,500 psf. Low Keng Huat clinched the site for S$1,001 psf ppr at a state tender in January 2017, relatively early in the land-buying cycle.


	Low Keng Huat and GuocoLand had room to price their projects more attractively - and move more units at launch.


	But they probably took the view that private home prices are unlikely to correct, despite the weak economy, and that they will be able to sell off their projects over a period of time.

	I don't understand why every news article about real estate agent must first talk about how much fantastic sales comm he gets.  It simply encourages the wrong values and motivation to join this industry.


	On the other hand, I have never seen news article about doctors and lawyers starts off with how much $$$ they earned or how many GCBs they owned.


	I hope one day, news articles about real estate agents start off with how many 5-stars reviews or good services review they were given by their clients.  And that agencies should give awards not solely just on the sales comm but also on other KPIs like number of good reviews, number of successful downlines, number of trainings they had shared,  number of real estate papers they had written, etc

	In expensive SG, space gonna be a luxury in future if not already now. These jumbo flats offer more bang for the buck, great for big families or enbloc owners who were previously used to big spaces as replacement homes, rather than buying new launch units at high psf paying more for less.

	Haha, i think its the perception that SG property always been HOT, so naturally agents are making good sales comms 😛


	Kindly correct if wrong, but even during current uncertain times, still seeing relatively good demand for new launches with increase in sales comm for some projects, surge in foreign demand with high end big quantum units, cash rich enbloc millionaires buying replacement homes and investment units etc ... all pointing to strong buy power.


	I'm sure many would like to invest into even more units, but are capped either by TDSR LTV,  or unwilling to pay more ABSD. The current game is now more skewed towards the cash rich, or owner occupiers (no absd) / genuine long term investors (no ssd).


	Good sales

	Developers will have to top up the 99 years lease if they were to enbloc an ageing 99-years leasehold property.  The cost of lease top-up may increase in future.  Hence, the issue of lease matters a lot now.

	Once monetary easing comes back into the market, there is a good chance that asset prices may continue to inch upwards at a faster pace. May be a good time to commit soon while there are still some soft sellers.


	How has waiting and looking and looking and waiting helped anyone in the last 10 years?

	Most important is which sector you are looking at.


	Old private resale for some areas is still facing some degree of competition from new and resale HDBs especially with the relaxation (increase) of the income cap. Few units available for each development but do go and take a lookie.


	Can also consider resale HDB if one can set aside concerns about future prices?

	These agents need to find out your requirements first before pushing you to new launches. There are some people who needed a house soon, how are they going to wait for 3 years? There are also some who needed bigger space but has a budget limitation, how are they going to buy new launches?


	There are some new launches that make sense, but only if they are able to fulfill the purchasing objective of the buyer.  


	I serve buyers quite a lot, and I can understand some of the pain buyers are going through when dealing with agents.  This is why I am very against news article that kicks off an agent story with how much comms the agent gets. Yes, it sell drama and stories, but it promotes the wrong values of joining this industry. We want agents who take care of clients' objective first, not his own comm first.  I really hope the media can start changing that tune for the good of the industry and for the consumers

	I hope IT can replace the job of housing agents asap


	there are now online e service apps for buyer n seller to do the buying selling without going through a agent


	I am not saying all agents are useless but if we can diy via online apps why pay these agents tens of thousands to do the same job? 


	I rather spend the money on holidays

	ALL hdb and most pte is LH, so are all GLS, if not for recent enbloc ... where to find FH?

	Average price of new RCR condos up 15.3% to $1,989 psf in Q2






This is the sharpest price increase in the past four years.


	Many new projects have breached the $2,000 psf benchmark for new homes in RCR, including Amber Park, which was sold for an average price of $2,481 psf. Another notable sale is Sky Everton with an average price of $2,525 psf.


	Despite the higher psf pricing, sales have been healthy at both projects as 156 units were sold at Amber Park whilst 133 units were moved at Sky Everton in Q2.

	Brand new still the preferred choice for many, so developers can continue to be able to sell high psf.


	Unless you talkng FH, if LH 99 years will also become old resales  😉


	With continued uptrend in psf prices affecting affordability, I reckon the next 'IN' thing for SG property not brand new but ... more SPACE 😉

	Many big countries already start to ease already to cope with the economic situation.


	We have been tightening for a decade. Others cheong we still tighten. This has pent up a decade of actual demand while prices has barely met inflation.


	Just ease a tiny bit will unleash so much hidden power. How to pain?

	Agreed, current sweet spot is around 1.5m range, partly due to ABSD.


	Last time if tell ppl sell hdb for 1m they say siao ah, now is the norm.


	EC then was just few hundred psf new, latest new launch EC already hit new benchmark avg-ing 1080psf ... the  list goes on


	So one thing for sure, property prices definitely on the UP,  across the board,  and getting more expensive 😉

	The grant may mean they aim for the most sought after. Anything else they would aim for private.

	Thanks for sharing.


	Can understand why some residents were against enbloc ...


	The recent sold unit bought in 2001 at just 429psf, so can just imagine the cost then for the first buyers in the early 80s ..probably cheaper than the cost for a hdb BTO in Clementi today! 😛


	Also many owners should be reaching if not already at retirement age, dun want hassle of moving and property hunt again for replacement home.

	EC is a more defensive option with prices lower than PC. But comparing new EC with resale PC, really hard.


	For the enjoyment of property, I feel the EC will be a better one. But for location, most PCs are better unless you live, work and study at far north.


	Its a personal choice.

	IMO, the climb on the URA index is mainly contributed by new launches; it does not represent the overall market sentiment.  The private resale is still  weak due to past cooling measures,  but the cooling measures did not quite affect the first timers (or hdb upgraders)  who are going mostly for the new launches.

	Just to share.


	My greatest mistake.


	I believe every Singaporean should buy a HDB, better still BTO as their first property. Cannot go wrong. Low maintenance. If it is truly subsidized and grant provided, literally part of your purchase is paid for by government. How nice?


	 


	After 5 years, you have saved to consider either to buy a freehold condo or stay put, taking account the economy then. You could rent out your condo or HDB and this provide another stream of income.


	 


	Basically having a HDB is like buying insurance, you will have a roof over your head regardless or at least more difficult to evict you.


	 


	Point is, in today's term is difficult to make money in the quickest time unless a windfall. So why be a slave to a self stay home.


	 


	A self stay home, especially if it is your first, is a liability, because it is all out and nothing coming in, in terms of return as long as you are staying. Capital appreciation is not a given.


	 


	When you eventually retire, no more salary, only passive income, so you need to find the lowest maintenance cost and that is HDB, which you have bought years ago.... BTO.


	Hope it helps.

	In the first place, it is not easy qualifying for BTO in today’s salary terms.


	Secondly, one planning to sell existing flat and to buy another BTO will find the queue excessively long and the chance to get extremely small as a second timer. To get a resale, I think they would rather stay put.


	Thirdly, by the time it comes to retirement some 10 or 20 years later, private property price appreciation is guaranteed compared to HDB prices. It is true that it is not a given within 3-5 years’ time.


	Btw, what exactly is your biggest mistake?

	Like I mentioned always, there is no right or wrong, except what you are willing to accept as a consequence for your decision.


	if you qualify in terms of salary for BTO, then it is an opportunity, as my colleagues said it is an asset 


	what I posted was about first time home buyer, buying a home is one of the most expensive investment, so wait a while may be a better for some then to rush into buying a re-sale which also mean the lease years are shorter and built are often not as good as newly built flats


	I beg to correct you about private property price is guaranteed compared to HDB prices, let me direct you to Mariam Way Condo.

	Thanks for sharing Ash!


	If i have a choice, i wish to buy BTO too, however the waiting time for the unit completion is a bit longer compared to the other option i'm considering. So we are thinking to use that BTO chance few years later on. Current resale HDB market, for units that are at better location, and just TOP now has reached about 700k - 800k eg tampines. If to buy older units, renovation will be needed then the cash outlay will be similar with just buying TOP unit....

	I don't know your profile but I would hope you keep these in mind:


	1. As long as PAP (my colleagues) are the majority and form the government, they would NOT let the HDB price fall too badly in times of recession or economic downturn. In fact, with aspiration of Singaporeans wanting the good life and living "like condo" style, to satisfy the mass, the government will build more and more like the Duxton. HDB prices will fluctuate but the general trend will be up. Hence, if this is your first property, HDB BTO. Resale has its own issues as you explained.


	2. If this is your first property, you really need to be practical and not have lofty ideas. Location, Location, Location as to what you can afford. Because it will eventually affect your selling price when you intend to sell in the future.


	3. The budget of your first property should not be one that stretches you until you got no savings for investment. You are still young and this is the golden years for you to accumulate wealth. When you made enough money later, you can choose where and when to buy. It becomes a no issue. It is like young man, little salary aspiration to buy big luxury car, it is an depreciating asset. It boost the ego but does nothing for this wealth accumulation and less his retirement.


	4. Speak to friends or relatives who have gone through what you are likely to go through to understand the pitfalls and what to steer clear. I find speaking to someone with vested interest like a property agent generally do no good unless you are very strong minded and know what you want without being persuaded otherwise.


	5. Buying a property is the easy part, it is the maintenance that may kill you financially. Eg Condos - quarterly maintenance (a few hundreds to a few thousands each month) have to pay regardless if you are working or not, property tax (keeps going up), setting aside money for repairs, utilities and etc. Every 10 years or so, all properties need upgrade or major maintenance work done, for HDB the government subsidize you heavily but in private you are on your own. In private it is very expensive for everything, eg changing a wall plug cost about $50 to 60 but in Condo no $100 to 150 no talk. If you are buying your first property, be prudent. There is no shame but should be congratulated for being financially wise. 


	5. Like I said, if I had to start all over, I would have bought a HDB flat as my insurance in life whether I need it or not. Along the way, capital appreciation. 


	6. Good luck.


	 


	I sincerely hope I had been helpful. If I may humbly request for good work done (if you think so) can help put in a good word for me to the undertaker (Radx). As you may know we have this love - love relationship. Thank you in advance.

			Just to share.
		

			My greatest mistake.
		

			I believe every Singaporean should buy a HDB, better still BTO as their first property. Cannot go wrong. Low maintenance. If it is truly subsidized and grant provided, literally part of your purchase is paid for by government. How nice?
		

			 
		

			After 5 years, you have saved to consider either to buy a freehold condo or stay put, taking account the economy then. You could rent out your condo or HDB and this provide another stream of income.
		

			 
		

			Basically having a HDB is like buying insurance, you will have a roof over your head regardless or at least more difficult to evict you.
		

			 
		

			Point is, in today's term is difficult to make money in the quickest time unless a windfall. So why be a slave to a self stay home.
		

			 
		

			A self stay home, especially if it is your first, is a liability, because it is all out and nothing coming in, in terms of return as long as you are staying. Capital appreciation is not a given.
		

			 
		

			When you eventually retire, no more salary, only passive income, so you need to find the lowest maintenance cost and that is HDB, which you have bought years ago.... BTO.
		

			Hope it helps.
		

			 
		



	I dun see it as a 'mistake' 😛


Go BTO first would be more conservative approach, while PTE first more 'garang' chiong first worry later YOLO (higher cost)


Self stay home should not be solely for investment or seen as a liability no input only output purpose calculated by $, but rather to fit into one's requirements, comfort and lifestyle.


	To me no right wrong, no one size fits all, whichever approach ... its all good.

			I don't know your profile but I would hope you keep these in mind:
		

			1. As long as PAP (my colleagues) are the majority and form the government, they would NOT let the HDB price fall too badly in times of recession or economic downturn. In fact, with aspiration of Singaporeans wanting the good life and living "like condo" style, to satisfy the mass, the government will build more and more like the Duxton. HDB prices will fluctuate but the general trend will be up. Hence, if this is your first property, HDB BTO. Resale has its own issues as you explained.
		

			2. If this is your first property, you really need to be practical and not have lofty ideas. Location, Location, Location as to what you can afford. Because it will eventually affect your selling price when you intend to sell in the future.
		

			3. The budget of your first property should not be one that stretches you until you got no savings for investment. You are still young and this is the golden years for you to accumulate wealth. When you made enough money later, you can choose where and when to buy. It becomes a no issue. It is like young man, little salary aspiration to buy big luxury car, it is an depreciating asset. It boost the ego but does nothing for this wealth accumulation and less his retirement.
		

			4. Speak to friends or relatives who have gone through what you are likely to go through to understand the pitfalls and what to steer clear. I find speaking to someone with vested interest like a property agent generally do no good unless you are very strong minded and know what you want without being persuaded otherwise.

	The grass is always greener on the other side.


	If no ABSD, the best strategy is to get a BTO (or 3rm resale) and wait for MOP to rent out, while buying a private.


	But with ABSD, the rent takes maybe 5 years or more to recoup, it may not be the best strategy to advocate anymore. In some cases, the ABSD = full cost of HDB to be paid upfront.


	It makes the move to go for two single name owned private comparable, with appreciation part of the game. As long as top incomes grow, in a small secure place like SG, prices will always grow. In fact it might even have doubled already if not for the plethora of cooling measures.

			Thanks for sharing Ash!
		

			If i have a choice, i wish to buy BTO too, however the waiting time for the unit completion is a bit longer compared to the other option i'm considering. So we are thinking to use that BTO chance few years later on. Current resale HDB market, for units that are at better location, and just TOP now has reached about 700k - 800k eg tampines. If to buy older units, renovation will be needed then the cash outlay will be similar with just buying TOP unit....
		

			 
		

			 
		



	Pls bear in mind that once you are in Private, it's very difficult to get back unto new HDB cos u have to sell your Private and wait for 30mths before u can apply BTO and with the building time of say 2.5 to 3 yrs, it would mean u have to have alternative housing for minimum of 5yrs at least. So like Ash mentioned, it's better to go BTO for your first flat and then consider Private later on if that suits but other way round not advisable, my 2 cents.....Good luck!

	Yes income ceiling is also another reason why best to buy BTO first and not later but that aside, the current rules are made intentionally to discourage Private owners to comeback and buy HDB BTO later. Actually, I find it's rather unfair. Each eligible family shld have their 2 bites of the cherry and that's it. Shldn't be penalising those from Private to come back to new HDB cos circumstances may mean a downgrade is required later.


	The authorities have the mentality that since you are in Private, u have made it so unnecessary rules are created to make it difficult for them to return to new HDB and to add salt to the wound, HDB owners are allowed to get Private and still keep their HDB and now they are even allowed to stay in the Private whilst renting out their HDB. Nvr understand why the authorities allow HDB owners to do this as HDB flats shld be sold once u move to Private as HDB flats are not meant to be investments as they are subsidised.


	Rules very skewed in favour of HDB owners currently

	HDB forms the bulk of the population. Must make sure they are happy overall.


	But that also means that looking far in the future, HDB prices will be held back to ensure everyone remains happy.

			In the first place, it is not easy qualifying for BTO in today’s salary terms.
		

			Secondly, one planning to sell existing flat and to buy another BTO will find the queue excessively long and the chance to get extremely small as a second timer. To get a resale, I think they would rather stay put.
		

			Thirdly, by the time it comes to retirement some 10 or 20 years later, private property price appreciation is guaranteed compared to HDB prices. It is true that it is not a given within 3-5 years’ time.
		

			Btw, what exactly is your biggest mistake?
		



	Yes ..... on mouth they say must be Prudent ........ in reality , they force you to take up huge loan  ops sorry , I mean nation building .

	This is not a hole. Patch this up means even first time buyers will be penalised in some way.

	Singapore Private Home Prices are Up Almost 1% in Q3 2019


	 


	What’s happening with private home prices?


	We can explain the price movements with the following:


	- Greater demand for prime and super-lux properties


	- Foreign investors having limited access to landed property


	- Darkening growth forecasts might be pushing local investors to real estate as well


	- The prospect of sustained low interest rates

	PSF wise it is probably a half or less the PSF of the price of a private property. If one is willing and able to accept shorter lease, it could even be a fifth of the price of private property in the same area. What’s there to be ex about?

	The main thing is it is not expensive if one is buying 100% for stay.


	Only if one is buying for capital preservation, investment, or inheritance purposes will it appear expensive.

	the question can be put the other way round


	we are not sure even if it is truly all 4 billion are transferred here or even less but just an overly optimistic estimate


	 


	in any economy, there would be different groups, some at the first sign of trouble regardless of fundamentals will sell all their stocks even when incurring lost, and yet some would hold on and even buy up more to average down their own holdings.


	so it is not surprise to see out flow of money 


	 


	I give you an example, Jim Rogers, for the past 5 or more years he keeps repeating his mantra that a very recession would happen, today still chanting. Sooner or later he would be right because financial markets go in cycles but this time round artificial intervention. He kpkb how worthless the USD is and how bankrupted the US is BUT you go and check he is holding a lot of USD now more so than before.


	 


	In short, these attention grabbing news may be politically motivated, who knows. For a country we need to look at those long term players and not the short term / speculators. 


	In Singapore, it is different, do we think Dyson came to Singapore like any other companies? The government has given them even the kitchen sink to get them to move their head office here. So quick a foreigner can be allowed to buy a good class bungalow in Singapore.


	 


	We need to read beyond the news.

	Think.


	Why these HK funds don’t go SZ or even BJ to begin with? 


	And also consider who will be left in HK and who would have left HK after all these fiasco. 28 years left for total unification of China and HK.

	If investors want to leave HK which is part of China why would still want to have their money in different parts of China (SZ or BJ)?


	 


	Actually, I also don't know what the future holds but like 1997, so many left including so much outflow of money but many of them returned and found their pot of gold.


	HK is part of China whether it is 28 years time or today. Surely there must be some transition for citizens to adapt and accept and it must start from somewhere. It is up to the citizens whether the one country and two systems can go on beyond 2047. 


	It is predicted that China would be the No.1 economy within the next 10 years or earlier. Many companies including countries would suck up to China, isn't Malaysia doing it with Huawei.


	We have to remember USA only got 300plus million people while China have close to 1.4billion people - the purchasing power is phenomenal.


	We shouldn't be worried about who would be left in HK or who would have left HK because there would be always opportunistic around. 


	 


	Let me put it this way, after 50 plus years, Singaporeans still kpkb about the same issues and still vote for the same. That is precisely why I still get to keep my day job.

	May I also remind that we are a population of 6million that works well with both China and US. Where on earth do you find another place that we used to share a spot with HK?

	Actually in 1997, only a small number left and small outflow of funds occurred, resulting in a huge oversupply of housing here. There really wasn’t any signs of the trouble we saw today. We haven’t actually built in anticipation of this...

	I respect your observation but I have a different opinion.


	 


	I honestly don't believe we work well with both China and US but we try to portray we work well with China and US. 


	I can only think why we appear to work well with US is because no other SE Asia country is a willing stooge except Philippines  but they learnt to say no. US needs a base in the region but no other neighboring countries is willing and is close enough to South China Sea. In addition, each year we pour 12 to 22 billion into their defense industry. Nobody in the right mind would dislike such a good customer.


	As for China, it is Singapore who is pro-active in establishing relationship with China and not the other way round. We did a lot of "funny things in the past" that displeased China but they choose to close one eye. Terrex incident is an eye opener of the souring relationship. Nobody in the right mind would go to their adversary home and make jokes about China on their pollution (window and soup). 


	It is true we share a spot with HK. But dynamics change. Our neighboring countries are catching up fast. I wondered how many know how much money we throw to keep to share a spot with HK. We should not look at HK as independent because it is part of China. Today's term, HK actually contribute very little to China's overall GDP. 


	Neighboring countries are being held back because of internal issues but once they are under control and not distracted, Singapore will face real serious challenges. 


	Honestly, I am never proud of the fact that we share a spot with HK because it is meaningless for the many average citizens in Singapore. Property prices may be sky high in HK but they have a low tax system (without all the tax upon tax eg water, COE and etc), comprehensive social safety net, their healthcare system is close to being free. Some say their waiting times are long but so is Singapore but Singaporeans have to pay a lot more even for C class but not in Hong Kong. 


	Fortunately, both places are great places to stay when you have the money.


	 


	Thanks for sharing your opinion. I appreciate it.

	We condemn foreign talents here and yet we are doing the same.

	see the size of these units - wonder how they manage to squeeze in 1 extra bedroom in such tiny spaces:


	2BR 635sqf


	3BR 926sqf


	4BR 1259sqf


	then I see the floorplans, one of the trick is use open kitchen and combine kitchen+living+dining into 1 small space 😂 


	another trick is shrink each bedroom to bare minimal only enough for 1bed and 1 wardrobe 😂 😂

	Statistical bias as many more are LH than FH.


	But FH also no success.


	Must digest current units first, then enbloc will go again regardless of lease. I suspect about 2021? 


	In the meantime, enjoy the broad price increase due to various reasons and components.

	More house are going under mortgage sale, but of course the number is negligible compares to the number of new sales every month, so  there should be no cause for concern.


	A corner unit around my place was put up for sale by Knight Frank for months,  but the sales has been unsucessful,  it was eventually auctioned off by Citibank  on the 3rd Oct, I guess lower than Knight Frank's asking price of $4.6m.

			see the size of these units - wonder how they manage to squeeze in 1 extra bedroom in such tiny spaces:
		

			2BR 635sqf
		

			3BR 926sqf
		

			4BR 1259sqf
		

			then I see the floorplans, one of the trick is use open kitchen and combine kitchen+living+dining into 1 small space 😂 
		

			another trick is shrink each bedroom to bare minimal only enough for 1bed and 1 wardrobe 😂 😂 
		

			very creative ah! 
		



	As mentioned prior, current trend is affordability, sweet spot around 1.5mil, with ABSD not helping matters.


	A 1.5mil unit ah gong already makan upfront profit 180k, when this could be used to DP for another unit shoebox.


	With psf on the up, only way to shrink unit size maintain sweet spot to move units, so nothing new here.


	That also why I've been saying ... 'go resale for better value' ... more bang for the buck 😉
