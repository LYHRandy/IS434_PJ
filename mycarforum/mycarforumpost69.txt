Whoa, the corridor reminds me of those studio flats in mature estates. Dark and narrow. The clothes hanging rack is a joke.

wow. 750k for a DBSS.
 
based on 80%/ 150k DP. we can assume
 
1. the couple work at least 5 yrs.
2, approx 30yrs old.
3. base on 12k salary. each max out CPF contribution abt 1.2k each.
4. loan 25 yrs
5. monthly repayment abt 2.7 @ 2.6% interest 
 
so by the time they are 55yr old. their CPF will be close to zero. 
 
they need to sell their flat for 1.11 M to break even. 
 
anything less than 1.1M they will not have any cash on hand because they will need to repay CPF for the interest .
 
so worse case scenario. at 55 less than 10 yr to retirement. they will have almost nothing in the CPF and a house which they would need to sell for more than 1.1M in order to see any cash.
 
quite scary don't you think?

Their corridor is 1.2m which is exactly what is required under the regulations.
 
That means you cannot leave any shoes outside at all otherwise it is considered to be against SCDF rules!

You are right. It is silly because HDB initially had the ability to do their own design and engineering work  (under Surbana which was wholly owned by HDB) but their backsides were itchy so they privatised Surbana and sold it off.

Those all under SERS already lor.
 
I know because I went to view a 2 or 3 room there after SERS was announced hoping to buy, stay there a while and then move to the new place after a few years. I passed up on it as the COV they were asking for was madness and I'd need to spend quite a fair bit to reno to stay there for 3-4 years.

Sibeh jialat man all these new DBSS and BTO design and quality, I really feel sorry for the buyers cos they bopian at the time demand was so hot if can get a place already is consider heng.
 
Even my block of chao peasant 2-room flat also the corridor not like that one, is open and airy, unker and aunty can grow plants or put shoe rack etc. If I want I can still squeeze a king-sized bed into my bedroom.
 
Sibeh jialats man, I rather stay in my 39-year old 2rm flat than their fancy simi DBSS.

I believe this DBSS is near to the MRT. Just the location alone, a newer 5 room HDB re sales would have fetch around $600k, so price is really ok for condo like HDB. Think the problem now is that they are more HDB like than condo like.

Ahhh... thanks for the info.. altho the location is good,  its not so prime to me.. pasir ris is really far from town (that's me la.. ) 
 
Nevertheless, as you've rightly pointed out.. its still HDB thinly dressed up nicer... no facilities, no private security, no pool, nothing.. over-priced if you ask me... I did a search in propertyguru, and just top up a bit more, can get used condo nearby with full facilities...

Hahaha.. ya, but ECP still jam la... and travel to town at least 30 mins or longer... I used to living in central , so far east and west i not used to the travelling.... but thats me la... haha... 
 
i do think some of the older condos and walk ups are about same price as the current DBSS n 5 rms, and those not mind a bit out of the way location can scout around for some good deals too....

I believe this DBSS is near to the MRT. Just the location alone, a newer 5 room HDB re sales would have fetch around $600k, so price is really ok for condo like HDB. Think the problem now is that they are more HDB like than condo like.

Some of the gates at the main doors of opposite flats along the corridors are so close together that the gates almost touch each other when they are swung open.
 
nabei ... 1.2m SCDF requirement really give choon choon 1.2m corridor
 
It is also worth noting that in a parliamentary reply in 2013 to a question of ensuring “clear passages along common corridors of HDB flats”, the Ministry of National Development said it was revising the clearance required from 1.2m to 1.5m, to provide for safety and rescue purposes. 
“To prepare for an ageing population and to provide wider access routes for people using mobility aids, BCA announced revisions to the Code on Accessibility last month.
“The revisions include a wider minimum clearance width of 1.5m along corridors for buildings with plans submitted for regulatory approval on or after 1 Apr 2014.”

DBSS is a flop - that's why the guy who took over axed it.
 
From my perception, HDB asked the developers to bid for the land and propose the building plan.
 
I think they hardly cared to consider/check whether the designs are good.
 
As long as the pricing is lower than EC is what they seemed to care.
 
So many years of experience in building HDB flats not tapped.

Khaw is the one who canned the scheme lah, Mah started it.  
It is another harebrained idea that allows private developers to buy cheap land from HDB and sell it at close to EC prices to buyers keen to enjoy condo fixtures.  KNN, isn't it obvious that all the profits, present and future, will be taken upfront by the developers, leaving DBSS buyers buying high with little upside 5 to 10 years down the road?  A couple of small developers got rich because of this stupid DBSS scheme, at least Khaw got the courage to kill it.  
 
At least Pinnacle benefits a diverse group of Singaporeans (not that I support buyers who sell after MOP although that is another story for another day).

wow. 750k for a DBSS.
 
based on 80%/ 150k DP. we can assume
 
1. the couple work at least 5 yrs.
2, approx 30yrs old.
3. base on 12k salary. each max out CPF contribution abt 1.2k each.
4. loan 25 yrs
5. monthly repayment abt 2.7 @ 2.6% interest 
 
so by the time they are 55yr old. their CPF will be close to zero. 
 
they need to sell their flat for 1.11 M to break even. 
 
anything less than 1.1M they will not have any cash on hand because they will need to repay CPF for the interest .
 
so worse case scenario. at 55 less than 10 yr to retirement. they will have almost nothing in the CPF and a house which they would need to sell for more than 1.1M in order to see any cash.
 
quite scary don't you think?

I said "nest", not "nest egg".
 
First you make the nest.
Then you lay the eggs.
Then the eggs hatch and your raise your chicks, thus continuing the circle of life.
 
Please don't sell your eggs.

Actually this kinda design is quite standard for BTO and HDB nowadays. It's to maximise light coming into the unit by having the unit's windows all facing out.
Hence u don't see some lower units being very dark and dim all year round like some of the earlier HDB flats.
Downside is that the service yard/kitchen and corridor tends to be dimly lit. My lift lobby is so dark during the day that HDB has left one of the lights permanently on 24-7
 
In this case the narrow corridor makes it look very bad. When it really would be much better if the units don't directly face each other and have a common corridor of another 0.5m wider.

I don't think the intention is to maximise light coming in but rather packing the maximum number of units onto the land.  Old design like point block has windows on 3 sides and really bright and breezy, including the lift landing.
 
It is all about maximising $$$ profits, heck if the buyers going to suffer.  Or HDB sleeping, outsource the design, construction and ultimately outsource the responsibility and accountability.  Maybe some MPs will come out and say just close your front door and you won't see the problem anymore.

If this is really the case then it is not the failure of the developer but a failure of either the architect or HDB.
 
HDB - They could have specified a maximum number of units (I think they already do this for private properties to prevent too many shoeboxes) or even specified number of units and a range of sizes
 
Architect - If HDB had already done the above properly and the architect still came up with this kind of design then who else is to blame?
 
The matter at hand is simple. DBSS developers charge prices that are higher than BTOs in the same location so they need to give a product that is of higher quality than the BTO (of course they have T&C to cover them but is that fair?)
Wow didn't know Singhaiyi has a hand in this 😂
 
It is surprising because they don't seem to be one of those fly by night developers. They have a few EC/condo projects in Singapore (and some investments in USA IIRC). Wonder what quality they are giving for their condos.

Packing the maximum units on the land is the responsibility of HDB mah. Land is a resource here. Ultimately they have to have some KPI to maintain so that land is efficiently utilised.
 
A balance has to be met, which of course the DBSS goes the complete opposite.
 
I don't really think so, cos if u've been to BTOs built in the late 90s to early 2000s, the number of units on each floor is more or less the same. 

I agree that HDB should be stricter on the DBSS developers, but all these are moot. Since the scheme ended.
Wait until my BIL's EC is out, before i comment on EC.

The 1.2m walkway reminds me of those rented one room flats in old housing estates.
 
What do you expect when the Pte develop bid high prices for the land parcel?
They got to squeeze somewhere to maximize their profits
So who win? 
SLA KPI - checked
Developer KPI - checked
Buyer - LLST

Khaw is the one who canned the scheme lah, Mah started it.
 
It is another harebrained idea that allows private developers to buy cheap land from HDB and sell it at close to EC prices to buyers keen to enjoy condo fixtures. KNN, isn't it obvious that all the profits, present and future, will be taken upfront by the developers, leaving DBSS buyers buying high with little upside 5 to 10 years down the road? A couple of small developers got rich because of this stupid DBSS scheme, at least Khaw got the courage to kill it.
 
At least Pinnacle benefits a diverse group of Singaporeans (not that I support buyers who sell after MOP although that is another story for another day).

True! Birds resting and flapping their wings at the aircon compressor also helps dry your clothes.  Heck, the birds are also nice enough to pay rent in poo when perched on the compressor.

Huge balconies are the result of the free 10% GFA under the old URA regulations. Any developer that didn't fully utilise it is a stupid developer.
 
Wonder what Citylife will be like since it is the same developer. Buyers must be worried right now.

Actually this kinda design is quite standard for BTO and HDB nowadays. It's to maximise light coming into the unit by having the unit's windows all facing out.
Hence u don't see some lower units being very dark and dim all year round like some of the earlier HDB flats.
Downside is that the service yard/kitchen and corridor tends to be dimly lit. My lift lobby is so dark during the day that HDB has left one of the lights permanently on 24-7
 
In this case the narrow corridor makes it look very bad. When it really would be much better if the units don't directly face each other and have a common corridor of another 0.5m wider.

 
that's why i will never buy those with corridor , walkway. i bought my punggol BTO with only 4 units per floor, each at one corner...

Guess i can only buy old condos next time. I really dislike huge balconies.
i used to not like balconies thinking it takes up valuable floor space. now that i have a balcony, i wish it can be bigger. 
 
i like that i can have plants there to create another feel which is different from the living room and bedrooms. it becomes a relaxation place for me to read, catch the breeze or just see the sky. the balcony opens up my living room. my cats like it more because they take their afternoon naps there. 
 
as long as a family take some effort to create a living space in the balcony (that means not turning it into a storeroom or laundry drying area), i believe having a balcony is a big plus to the family home.

LESS THAN 1.2m!!!!
 
http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/housing/story/residents-dbss-project-pasir-ris-one-complain-over-flaws-lack-corridor-#4
 
 

 

SINGAPORE - Residents of Pasir Ris One - the last of the Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) projects - have raised concerns over problems with their premium Housing Board flats.
The Straits Times understands that complaints involve common corridors that are too narrow, persistent workmanship defects and design flaws.
In one case, a resident living on the second floor found the view from his balcony blocked due to the position of the sheltered drop-off area directly below his unit.
"This was never in the original plans," said the resident, who identified himself as Mr So. "If I knew the top of the shelter would go beyond the first floor, I would have purchased a unit on a higher floor.
"It's very disappointing because this was supposed to be my dream home," the general manager, 42, told The Straits Times.
According to Mr So, the project's developers had offered to upgrade his three-room flat to a four-room unit as there were no other three-room ones available.
Pasir Ris One is a collaboration between property developers SingHaiyi Group and Kay Lim Holdings. The 447-unit project was launched in April 2012 and a unit costs between $390,000 and $770,000.
A major bugbear for residents is the narrow common corridor, which according to Chinese daily Shin Min Daily News measures just 1.17m wide.
Based on fire safety guidelines published on the Singapore Civil Defence Force website, a minimum clearance of 1.2m is required.
"It's enough of a squeeze that two people might have trouble walking side by side," said one resident who declined to be named. "This could be a serious safety hazard in the event of emergencies."
Others were worried whether larger pieces of furniture could fit through the corridors.
A SingHaiyi spokesman told Shin Min that the project was built within the safety requirements specified by the Housing Development Board (HDB).
Residents also highlighted issues within their flats, such as how the master bedroom could not fit a king-sized bed.
But a resident by the name of Mr Lim, who had purchased a three-room unit, said he was already prepared for the small unit size after viewing the showflat.
Instead, Mr Lim was unhappy over the persistent defects such as floor tiles popping up, cracks on window panes and stains on doors.
"The developers sent workers to fix the defects, but the problems kept cropping up as the workmanship was poor to begin with," he said.
"It definitely doesn't feel like this is worth the amount of money we paid."
The Straits Times has contacted HDB and SingHaiyi for comment.
Other DBSS projects have also been plagued by similar woes. Earlier this month, a group of residents of Centrale 8 in Tampines were upset about the quality of the finishes and fittings and were hoping to get the developer to extend the warranty period for defects.
Those living at Trivelis in Clementi were also told in May that they could receive a goodwill package from developers after various problems - from defective stove knobs and rusty dish racks to shower glass panels that shattered easily - were detected.- See more at: http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/housing/story/residents-dbss-project-pasir-ris-one-complain-over-flaws-lack-corridor-#4

Well the crap keeps people out of their homes and in the office which benefits the firms, eateries and shops, though birth rates my plummet!
 
So build enough of such crap to keep our GDP high and also build less crappy places for those to have large families.

wow. 750k for a DBSS.
 
based on 80%/ 150k DP. we can assume
 
1. the couple work at least 5 yrs.
2, approx 30yrs old.
3. base on 12k salary. each max out CPF contribution abt 1.2k each.
4. loan 25 yrs
5. monthly repayment abt 2.7 @ 2.6% interest 
 
so by the time they are 55yr old. their CPF will be close to zero. 
 
they need to sell their flat for 1.11 M to break even. 
 
anything less than 1.1M they will not have any cash on hand because they will need to repay CPF for the interest .
 
so worse case scenario. at 55 less than 10 yr to retirement. they will have almost nothing in the CPF and a house which they would need to sell for more than 1.1M in order to see any cash.
 
quite scary don't you think?

 
no need to even dream of 1.1m
 
if they can sell the flat for the same price they bought, already can celebrate
 
after 5 yrs, the flat turns old, design turns old.. the new BTO in 5 yrs time prob also look better than your DBSS
 
how to charge a premium over BTO?
 
good luck to the buyers

Your worst case situation to me is already considered good situation.
 
Because you never factor in having babies in future or job stability for the next 5 years.
 
they have to constantly live in fear if economy is not doing well (which is happening at this point) and their jobs being snatch by a better, faster and cheaper FT.
 
Then come to producing next gen, they need to planned carefully when and how to up bring the kid. 
Not to mention, they cannot eat expensive meals or buy a small CC car. because they typically living like a church mouse in their atas coated surface.
 
So ppl whom bought this Pasir Ris one, i wish them best of luck because with such a crappy designed home, I'm sure they cannot sell more than a million unless the 6.5 million happen in the next 5 years where almost everyone is fighting for a living space and disregard if that space is hosted in crappy environment or not.

there is likely no way for the developer to increase the width of the corridor, unless they demolish the whole block and rebuild. if they had initially catered another 30cm more for the corridor, there would have been no such issue now.
 
anyway, they should remove the grille at the end of the corridor. that grille adds to the feeling that the whole corridor is a prison cell. removing that grille might help alleviate the problem a wee bit. developer scared people will jump from the corridor?

you open door ... you step back ... your ASS touch neighbour ASS ... how?
i'm sure mock will ask ... is it a chiu bu or SLS aunty? lol
 
 

 
i have seen some families in HDB blocks who like to leave their metal door wide open, taking up the corridor space. if this happens in that dbss, be prepared for more neighbour squabbling.

this is shunfu hudc. nice place. big land area and very very windy. nearly bought a unit there in 2004. unfortunately, wife felt that 1700 sq ft is way too big for the 2 of us. but with the recent privatisation and the fencing up completed, i feel that the overall look of the place from outside has changed for the worse.

oh. I was wrong. the hdb blocks behind the hudc looks exactly like the hdb flats in shunfu.  the old flat designs in mid 80s i think still the best so far. big, squarish, and windy (for my pigeon hole). did i forget to mention "cheaper"? 
 
these 2 estates must be built same time around 1984 then. 1 template design, replicate everywhere. just like now. unfortunately, the existing hdb template a bit sala.

The way they calculate a unit's internal floor area is from the middle of the wall to the middle of the other wall. Not too sure if this explains the discrepancy.

DBSS had left a really bad taste for buyers
let's see which MND minister dare to relaunch DBSS ... lol

 
that's why Marlboro Tan will leave his "popular legacy" in Singapore history 
 
 

The Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) was announced in parliament by then Minister for National Development Mah Bow Tan on 7 March 2005, with the objective of involving the private sector in building public housing. The DBSS enables the existing public-housing programme to be more sensitive to the changing needs of Singaporeans and offers alternative options for aspiring homeowners with higher disposable incomes.[1] The co-opting of the private sector in the building of flats is also a strategy by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) to move away from its builder role in order to concentrate on regulating the public-housing sector.[2]
 
Under the DBSS, developers have to bid for the open land tender and take charge of the entire process of flat design, construction and sale.[3] To ensure that these flats remain affordable, first-time buyers can apply for Central Provident Fund (CPF) housing grants of between S$30,000 and S$40,000,  while  second-time buyers are exempt  from paying  the resale levy on the price of their previous flat. Eligible buyers can also obtain loans from the HDB at concessionary rates.[4] The price of DBSS flats are measured against the prices of new and resale HDB flats.[5] To entice buyers, priority quotas typically given to first-time homeowners, as well as couples who buy flats within close proximity of their parents’ homes, were lifted after the first month of the DBSS project launch.[6] At the time the DBSS was introduced, prospective homeowners were subject to the same eligibility conditions that apply to flats built by the HDB, such as an S$8,000 monthly household income ceiling. To ensure that public housing remains affordable, this ceiling for DBSS flats was increased to between S$8,000 and S$10,000 from 30 August 2010.[7]
 
Private developers of DBSS flats have greater autonomy in deciding on the “flat design, size, type and configuration”, provided they adhere to the prevailing HDB public-housing guidelines concerning “open concept, building quality and safety and avoidance of facilities that are expensive to maintain”. Flat prices are also determined by developers, taking into account the regulations imposed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.[8]
 
The launch of the pilot DBSS project was initially met with tepid response from private developers due to the unpredictability of the property market, a persistent excess of 9,000 new flats and unfamiliarity with the public-housing market and its numerous stipulations. As an incentive, HDB provided classified statistics on the demand and supply of its new and resale flats to help developers have a better gauge of the public-housing market. Several briefings on the DBSS and its regulations were held for the Real Estate Developers Association and individual developers.[9] The HDB also offered a leasehold tenure of 103 years for successful bidders of DBSS projects, to ensure that buyers would have a full 99-year lease on their flats.[10]
 
Upon completion of DBSS flats, private developers are liable for any building defects for up to a one-year period, but the maintenance of common areas and public carparks in the estate will come under the purview of the town council. DBSS flats have a 99-year lease, which is administered by HDB upon the completion of the flats.[11]

In mgt, appt of special task force etc is to gather all different expertise to troubleshoot n pinpoint problems. In company restructuring, external consultants is bring in to axe the people without being responsible. Imho, the task force is same purpose.. :-) buy time, drink kopi , talk talk but end of day depending if objective n big guns any concrete action can be taken.. Remedial action after all done would be very tough esp 1.2m corridor how to modify ? :-(

In mgt, appt of special task force etc is to gather all different expertise to troubleshoot n pinpoint problems. In company restructuring, external consultants is bring in to axe the people without being responsible. Imho, the task force is same purpose.. :-) buy time, drink kopi , talk talk but end of day depending if objective n big guns any concrete action can be taken.. Remedial action after all done would be very tough esp 1.2m corridor how to modify ? :-(

What can the developer do with regards to the narrow corridor where everything has been built. 
 
I say developer knew about such issue but decided to 'eat' into it because once it's built buyer can only accept as it is.
 
If SCDF plays the hard ball and declare it non-compliant i wonder what the developer is gonna do about it.

Sad to say that many prefer to point many fingers and end up making the owners feel worse.
 
Some situations have solutions, some is to manage as best as we could, some is for future generations to learn from. No matter what, judgement errors cannot be 100% avoided as we are all humans.
 
I think the fiasco also shows how difficult it is to ensure the production quality flats. Those with quality HDBs or private homes need to appreciate the work put in for its production. So many aspects (like the sub-con) that needs to be managed well.

Eh please leh. SG50.
 
So HDB has about 50 facking yrs of experience of public housing building experience.
 
DBSS is HDB whether they like it or not bec potential buyer need to meet HDB criteria on income to qualify, this is beyond even Throttle2.
 
Straightforward things like corridor at 1.2m or thereabouts is not a mistake! It is freaking negligence! It's something that has been banished from SG living memory. You don't see this in new HDB flats anymore...at least until Singhaiyi resurrected it!
 
Why didn't they bring to bear this rich experience to the project at Pasir Ris? Even if you say it's only a small percentage lah, nvm. Then you pay back all the buyers lor.

Pasir Ris One's narrow corridors meet guidelines 
 
QUESTION OF SPACE: A worker walks along the common corridor of an apartment block at the DBSS project.
 
The corridors are 1.2m wide; SCDF guidelines state that there must be a clear passage of at least 1.2m along corridors.
 
Photo: ST Pasir Ris One's narrow corridors meet guidelines My Paper | Amos Lee, Janice Heng | Thursday, Jun 25, 2015 Amos Lee, Janice Heng My Paper Thursday, Jun 25, 2015 T
 
HE narrow corridors of premium Housing Board project Pasir Ris One are making some residents feel squeezed. The 1.2m-wide corridors of the Design, Build and Sell Scheme development are technically within regulations. Yet they put a crimp on everyday life, said residents such as Shaun Chew, 51."My neighbour and I cannot even open our doors at the same time," said the supervisor, who lives in a five-room flat on the ground floor.
 
The Singapore Civil Defence Force's (SCDF's) guidelines state that there must be a clear passage of at least 1.2m along corridors.The same width was specified in the Building and Construction Authority's Accessibility Code until a 2013 revision.Since 1.2m is exactly the width provided, the development sits on the margins of the rule. 
 
New residential projects submitted for approval from April 1 last year must have a 1.5m minimum width instead.The Pasir Ris One corridors run up against another restriction.Most town councils have by-laws against obstructions in common corridors, which typically follow SCDF's guidelines.If residents put items outside their flat, they must leave a passage of at least 1.2m.In HDB corridors which are 1.4m wide, for instance, this is not a problem.
 
For Pasir Ris One, this means that no one can place items outside their homes.  When The Straits Times visited yesterday, the corridors were bare except for one or two pairs of shoes outside some units.
 
"The designs and plans for this development have been approved and fall within all guidelines stipulated by the BCA  , which were established with safety and comfort of residents in mind  ," said manager and project administrator Dennis Lam from SingHaiyi Group, which jointly developed Pasir Ris One with Kay Lim Holdings.
 
"That said, we take the residents' views seriously and will take all feedback on board for review  ," he added.But these technicalities do not change the reality for residents  . Said Mr Chew:
 
"There is a childcare centre nearby. With the narrow corridor, if we happen to open our doors, (they) may hit the children."Not being able to place items outside is not a big issue for some residents, though. Their units have balconies for potted plants and an entry area for shoes."It is okay if there are no obstructions," said Lin Jun Yao, 29, who lives in a five-roomer with his family of five.For Mr Lin, workmanship was more of a concern. "The tiling was uneven, cabinet joints loose and materials were cheap."Other home owners noted scratched tiles, leaking pipes and noisy doors.Said Mr Lam: "We are in touch with owners who have provided us with feedback and are currently working with them to address their respective concerns."amoslee@sph.com.sgjaniceh@sph.com.sg

Agree that this is kind of a rookie problem, but the main responsibility for the building of DBSS is still private developers, in this case Singhaiyi. The developers might have followed the rule book without carefully considering the space that we are used to.
 
This is what I understand bout DBSS.

hdb is at best in denial they have lousy design.
 
which one i refer to? Of course the mscp design where they had to put up sign and tell people to be careful when reversing and not knock onto the metal railing.
 
there was once i needed to take things from my boot but was near impossible. Why?
 
Thats because the car on the upper level is idling and the exhaist is blowing straight at my boot area and in my face.

i remember walking around those (cant remember one room or 2 room rental flats in Syed Alwi area - must be 40 years old!) where the units  entrance door faces each others in a kind of dark alleyway- its definetely more wider and can store newspapers/cupboards and even do karung guni business   
 
But really 1.2m is going beyond too much; Anyway the Architects followed the CD or BCA min specs. The Authorities must update this to more than 1.5 m; how to even move furniture or king size mattress - sure kena damaged by someones grill handle or something like that sticking out or even a prayer thingy

It can be frustrating especially a roof over our head is probably to most expensive item that we will ever purchase in our life. And for some, this maybe the only house that are buying.
 
There are things that cannot be changed no matter how unhappy we are. However, we, human, are adaptable. After a while, we may not feel the narrowness of the corridor or the ugly sight of the gas pipes or the height of the bbq pit. The closeness to amenities and public transport and nice neighbours are equally important if not more important.
 
Hence, do not let these unhappiness negates the good feeling of moving into a brand new place. Focus on the plus and not magnify the minus. Even a very high end project will have issues.

That's a good opinion too. Sell after lock in period. And if that is the intention, then shouldn't the owners singing praise of the project or at least keep quite... Like that can sell higher mah..
 
Smart buyer will sure use all these issues to press for a better price.

one way to look at it is since neighbours dun interact with each other, so no need big corridor as all families will keep their door closed, what is more important is inside the house.
 
Another way to look at it is since neighbours dun interact with each other, the narrow corridor increase the chance of neighbour bumping (literally) into each other and start chatting.

Truly the alleys of yesterday allows neighbours to literally talk to each other like they are in the same unit. 
 
Their icebreaker can be about the alleys.

hdb is at best in denial they have lousy design.
 
which one i refer to? Of course the mscp design where they had to put up sign and tell people to be careful when reversing and not knock onto the metal railing.
 
there was once i needed to take things from my boot but was near impossible. Why?
 
Thats because the car on the upper level is idling and the exhaist is blowing straight at my boot area and in my face.
 
Thats what i call a FAILED design,,, 

 
Aiyoh, you can choose to take things from the boot, it's whether you choose to take or not. Familiar?

Adding to the above....less corridor area to sweep, less lighting needed to light up.......not forgetting you are forced to stop at your neighbor's unit to interact if their gate is opened.......

I do stay HDB. But the purpose of having house warming is to invite people to your house to see see look look.
 
No point having buffet at multipurpose hall and should you need to use washroom, you will need to go to the house. If you are talking about reunion / gathering, I think multipurpose hall or function room(condo) will be better.
 
Bottomline, we are talking about people loitering inside the house to create 'Wang Qi' for the house.

house warming in condo usually done in club house function room
 
follow by a tour of the unit, but since the area so small these days, only 2 guests are allowed at a time

Because many exceeded the income ceiling and hence not eligible? Or you meant to say lucky enough to ballot for a unit?
Exceeded the income ceiling lo. For a BTO is a steal and for DBSS is still cheaper than resale market. No doubt... :)

i notice the location DBSS are usually in matured estate and conveniently located near mrt, etc.
 
Hence they are peg to the resale value of the hdb there (equivalent size) and slightly higher.

When they don't understand that there are plenty of potential buyers willing to buy, just not eligible to get them.

On the topic, the narrow corridor really reminds me of those days in the late seventies early eighties playing along the corridors of one room hdb flats in those older estates.
 
The malay aunty would sell curry puffs at her door, the chinese auntie would sell sng pao at her door and the indian auntie would sell sugared drinks at her door.  Those were truly times when neighbors knew each other well.  
 
Maybe they trying to bring back that spirit?

Bro, i thought you knew.
All this while, i am trying to tell the folks here that i am not considered rich.
And i never thought i was rich, but people insisted i was and suan me about it.
You go ask the real rich anywhere, if they think i am rich?
 
Problem is many of those here think that having a few gold watches and some private property is rich.
Well , its time to wake up to reality.  The rich are at least three standard deviation away to the right.
While the most of us are within the normal distribution.
 
Those who think i am rich are themselves, in denial. Why ?becos they are in actual fact consoling themselves for if at my stinking level i can be considered rich then they can be deemed as not too bad 
Jokes aside,. I have seen, met, talked to, worked with so many of these true blue haolians to tell you i am not one.   
 
In a forum, we all just talk more than we do in real life, thats all.
If i have it, i have it and i find no need to hide it.
If folks want to eat the sour grape and feel sore with jealousy when they see my gold watches, i cant help it.  I am not a politician, i dont have to care.
But enough of explaining already, i have done it too often.
 
Anyway, when the aunties were selling stuff at their doorstep, i was a 7 yr old kid who was happy just having a sngbao to suck on as i raced through the narrow corridors with my friends.  Those were carefree days.

1. HDB started the DBSS in the first place
 
2. HDB has to realise that a “one-year defects warranty” is not enough time
 
3. HDB needs to admit that they are ultimately responsible to homeowners

buyers must recognise that DBSS is expensive is not due to its tok kong material or out of the mind design
it's peg to the resale value of nearby hdb (opportunity cost)
 
selling price is not equal to development cost + profit margin
selling price = speculated price including opportunity cost
that piece of land if it is not developed as DBSS, could have been a mickey mouse condo selling at no $1200 psf no talk ...

That's all fine but consider this now:
 
Selling cost > resale value of nearby HDBs
building quality and design < resale value of nearby HDBs

ok lar bro...i understand and i feel for you. The definition of rich varies for everyone and to see you talk about cigars and see all those rolex and your bicycle (hahaha) says a lot about your lifestyle....if not rich maybe you are a well-to-do guy and it all comes from your hardwork...ya! For my case my family is certainly not rich (just normal hardworking pheasants) but some of my wife's granny side are and most of them have migrated elsewhere away from SG.....but luckily they arent haolian when they meet us.....maybe because we are relatives!

I believe having better built was one of the selling pt to justify higher price. There's one dbss at punggol park which do no have much amenities nearby and it's on virgin land, I.e non matured estate.

The really rich until cannot finish spending are unlikely to want to share any experience with others. They neither have time nor wish to spend time this way. For that, I salute your sincere comments! *Salute*!
 
But rich also relative. 3 SD of the population to be rich is extremely hard to achieve for most people, and not very sure if many are prepared to give or give up what it takes to reach there. Many of us are just minions who aspire to move up that 1 rung of the ladder at a time.
 
B&B issues plague most of us. To upgrade this or downgrade that. COE movements scintillate our emotions. 
 
I enjoyed my sngbao in kampung from the minivans that moved from one house to another. Great days to reminisce!

Anyway I also grew up in HdB, but later on kena barred from buying.

Mr Khaw said about 80 per cent of applicants meet the requirements for purchasing a HDB flat, and it is uncommon for prospective buyers to have income that exceeds the income ceiling. However, he acknowledged that Singaporeans' incomes have increased since 2011. As such, Mr Khaw has asked the HDB to look into this, to see if an adjustment is needed. 
"If you ask for my personal opinion, I think (there is) a need to do some adjustments and I generally prefer to give every Singaporean couple a chance of living in HDB. You may come from say an upper-income group. You do not need an HDB flat," the minister said.
"But I feel that it's good for all Singaporeans, or almost all Singaporeans to have a chance of living in HDB for 5 years, and interact with the community, I think it's part and parcel of a Singaporean way of life. It's just like males go for National Service, and I think if we can give them this opportunity of staying in HDB towns, I think there are more positives than negatives."

Trying to improve HDB sales ?? 
 
But like that means the lowe/middle income group will face longer BTO queues since the upper income group can join in....

When there is no restriction on income eligibility, I think the new and resale HDBs will shoot through the roof. But it might come with some restrictions in some areas to minimize those who apply but no intention to live in. Or maybe apply but less grants or something.

Bro, i thought you knew.
All this while, i am trying to tell the folks here that i am not considered rich.
And i never thought i was rich, but people insisted i was and suan me about it.
You go ask the real rich anywhere, if they think i am rich?
 
Problem is many of those here think that having a few gold watches and some private property is rich.
Well , its time to wake up to reality. The rich are at least three standard deviation away to the right.
While the most of us are within the normal distribution.
 
Those who think i am rich are themselves, in denial. Why ?becos they are in actual fact consoling themselves for if at my stinking level i can be considered rich then they can be deemed as not too bad
Jokes aside,. I have seen, met, talked to, worked with so many of these true blue haolians to tell you i am not one.
 
In a forum, we all just talk more than we do in real life, thats all.
If i have it, i have it and i find no need to hide it.
If folks want to eat the sour grape and feel sore with jealousy when they see my gold watches, i cant help it. I am not a politician, i dont have to care.
But enough of explaining already, i have done it too often.
 
Anyway, when the aunties were selling stuff at their doorstep, i was a 7 yr old kid who was happy just having a sngbao to suck on as i raced through the narrow corridors with my friends. Those were carefree days.
 
Hope you understand

 
Thank you for sharing. I know you don't consider yourself rich, and in the big picture, yes, you're right (or maybe not, we don't know how much you have).
 
It's just that the car you have, as well as the watches and cigars that your pictures sometimes show, are not exactly within the means of the majority of the population.
 
In a way, it's all relative. To the beggar on the street, he might look at a passerby with an iPhone and think that the passerby is richer than him, being able to afford some luxuries. But that passerby takes the bus, and looks out the window, and see a M5 go by, and think that the M5 driver is rich, being able to afford a superb car.
 
Then the M5 driver drives past the airfield at Seletar, and sees some young technology company CEO stepping out of his personal Gulfstream and thinks that the CEO is rich. The CEO just had a meeting with the oil sheik of a small oil rich nation in the gulf, and the CEO is feeling sad that he's not as rich as the sheik.
 
Anyway, I really do get what you mean, I'm just sharing the my view, the one as a passerby in the story above.

It is my believe that it takes two hands to clap. Blatantly truthfully you too have a part to play to create the impression others have of you. There is nothing wrong with that.
 
Look at Bill Gates, nobody goes around teasing him about being hao lian (by the way he is the riches guy in the world as of today.
 
Hence, I don't see the need to explain but just accept that the "impression is imprinted". It will go away if with time we all die and new members come in or you re-incarnate into T3 but please not BT (budget terminal).
 
Have a good weekend.

Sure.  But since we are at that subject, let me share a bit more 
As per your example:
Begger and passerby, yes passerby richer.
Passerby and M5 owner, yes M5 owner richer
M5 and jetplane , yes jetplane richer.
The above is however pure mathematical comparison of who is richer.
 
However, i am not talking about who is mathematically richer, i am talking about a state of "richness" using the Singaporean of today as a base.  Correct, I am probably mathematically richer than many of you here (even if it is by a few dollars), but to be classified in a state of being rich in Singapore, no way lah. I am a salaried employee.
 
 Thats why i was sharing with you guys regarding the bell curve. 
In here, i beleive, we all can afford food on our table, cars, entertainment, holidays, etc etc etc....
And therefore we all basically fall into the same category. The difference in mathematical wealth is not what i am discussing becos nobody will be equally rich, some will be poorer and some will be richer.
 
Anyway, i am cool with all this banter and dont take offence with the suaning.
Its all in the fun of a forum.  Just want to clarify my perspective, thats all.
 
Okay fellas back to topic, dont ot liao

So then it is all a matter of what you consider rich. 2 men could have the same networth and a different idea of the rich cutoff point.
 
Also, you've mentioned a couple of times that you are just a salaried employee. What does that matter? There are some salaried employees out there making millions a year and in fact, our ministers could also be considered salary men.

yes, only a few projects including public (hdb/dbss/bto) and private condo and commercial buildings
however, it's evident that building development standard and quality has dropped tremendously
if relevant authority is not looking into the matter, it may get worse and out of control
any deficiency that is not look into will get worse over time
 
from A-team perspective .... a grade B is not acceptable not even A- ... lol
 
spore motto is to hold everything and anything to its highest standard ...
otherwise, spore will lose its competitiveness and "high quality high standard" hallmark chop ... hehe
 
if we start to accept crack is acceptable ...
soon water dripping/leaking is normal = msia standard liao ... lol

Who will buy? It will be difficult to sell now that people has seen the actual thing. Especially in 5 years when it starts to look more like a slum.

True. My heart goes out to the residents. It will be tough to sell given the price and layout. I had sold mine since mop and recently I went back my old plc to take a look...the playground's not maintained, garden kns, flies all around...

I am not acting acting poor, its a big bunch here acting rich.
 
On the topic, the narrow corridor really reminds me of those days in the late seventies early eighties playing along the corridors of one room hdb flats in those older estates.
 
The malay aunty would sell curry puffs at her door, the chinese auntie would sell sng pao at her door and the indian auntie would sell sugared drinks at her door.  Those were truly times when neighbors knew each other well.  
 
Maybe they trying to bring back that spirit?

Spirit? Wooooo.....
 
Just spoken to someone who lives in Trevelis.
 
The furniture sux big time. Bedroom wadrobe are nothing but shells made of inferior quality planks, open the wadrobe and you see the wall inside and the tiled floor below. No drawers, you have to buy them yourself.
 
Bathroom and bedrooms are so damn cramp.

From photo, the corridor looks quite dark n narrow n looks unwelcoming for a home
 
If i m buying resale, I will give this a miss even if it's cheap which of coz won't be, people almost always profit (more or less) after 5 years
 
Prefer bright n sunny corridor, those that can grow plants are the best
 
I can grow my sunflowers, onions, curry leaves etc...

Either way, I don't hold any ill will towards you (any suan a bit is just for fun), if anything, I enjoy such sharing sessions (learning about those richer than me, as well as the UHNWI).
 
Let me take this chance to share a book I read previously, "Richistan" by Robert Frank.
http://www.amazon.com/Richistan-Journey-Through-American-Wealth/dp/0307341453
 
He talks about the same rich you talk about, private jets, yachts, multiple mansions and 7-9 digit art pieces.
Ok, sorry, I OT too.. Haha..
 
750K for a house with such a corridor. Really depressing. Especially if we're going to spend so much time in that place. I would be more depressed by the corridor than the defective interior (maybe). Monday blues will take on a whole new meaning.

Housing is all about space, doesn't matter common space or your own unit space. It all adds up bec you use it daily.
 
Going home should be a happy affair, something you look fwd to, not dreading the crappy squeezy corridor (unless all your neighbour are JAV female leads) or being reminded that your masterbedroom cannot put king bed and after you compromise with a queen bed, the room still feels freaking tight.
 
HDB really kilat when building flats. I hope they don't flush that experience down the drain when some scholar CEO decides to "revamp" it for his own KPI/ resume.

Yup, agree that a house is our home and it must be something we wanna spend time in. I was considering those 5 years resale flat in Sengkang/punggol versus older resale units in mature estates.
 
In the end, I decided to choose a flat in mature estate because the space in mature estate is much bigger than newer unit. In terms of convenience and marketing and costs of living, mature estate has an advantage in these areas

The only downside is need to spend more on renov. I brought a 40 plus years resales (corner unit) as well and spend close to 100 for renov, furniture and fitting. I can only say the price I paid worth it. Bedroom space for a queenside, closest, study table and a tv console. There are even space for me to sleep on the floor if I there is a need. 
As advised by the air con installer we have increased the power to 12000 each as to the standard 9000 due to the side of living room and bedroom.

The only downside is need to spend more on renov. I brought a 40 plus years resales (corner unit) as well and spend close to 100 for renov, furniture and fitting. I can only say the price I paid worth it. Bedroom space for a queenside, closest, study table and a tv console. There are even space for me to sleep on the floor if I there is a need.
 
As advised by the air con installer we have increased the power to 12000 each as to the standard 9000 due to the side of living room and bedroom.

 
Sometimes also have to see the need for rectification works for very old HDBs.
Best is to check with the residents.
 
My parents flat just reached 30 years old this year.
Over the last 2-3 years, rectification works after rectification works been on-going in the area. 
Roof, rubbish chute, toilets, water pipes, lifts, external repair of the block.
 
While the residents benefit, can be quite tiring to live there for the time.

I believe in 70s, 80s, 90s, HDB built flats also have its fair share of short comings here and there. But we are more tolerant and understanding then. We are happy to be given a roof over our head to get married.
 
My wife and me queued for more than 3 years before we were asked to choose a flat under the old scheme in mid 90s. And we chose to queue for new flats in west region because less popular so hopefully faster to get a unit. And the area allocated were Bt Panjang and Jurong West when it was our turn. And our appointment was towards to end of the selection period. Meaning we only got to select leftovers. We weren't unhappy. We were just happy to be able to get a place to get married.

I also had to queue for 3 years but the biggest peeve for my case was after queuing and selecting the flat
 
hdb decided then that due to over building and excess stock, they dropped the prices and allowed walk in selection

during that time, they have roadshows in very grand scale to promote their flats. Inside got peekture, mock ups, lego plans, excursion bus to bring you to the estate to look look see see. 
 
Too bad, balls not big enough, scared this scared that, bought the smallest unit - 4 room. Should have hooted the last remaining executive unit with four bedrooms.

Not only that. Prices dropped drastically as well for WIS units, although admittedly not much choices left. The same facing maybe 10 floor differences dropped maybe 25-30% in prices.
 
Now also got sale of balance flat, but for mature estates need quite a bit of luck to get it.

Solution, all sliding door like prison, or reopen new fire escape side door.

I agreed.  Last time 5 room is at least 120sqm and there's 3 bedroom and 1 study room at S$170,000 during application.  But when i selected the flat 2 years later, it shrinked to 110sqm at S$297,000.

I think this is about managing expectation again... DBSS was hyped as the better thing to BTO since it was developed by "private" developers that had built numerous condos... everyone that bought the flat believed that the only thing bad about DBSS is that it doesn't have swimming and condo facilities...
 
If it is a REAL condo... with such sub standard do you think anyone will buy? No property agency would even want to market for them...
 
Just because it is under HDB and owners have to suck their thumb? Now they are neither here nor there because developer says it is under HDB regulations... HDB says bo bian under Private Developer...

Yes but as of now most of the rectification works were done externally to the unit. Led Corridor light. Lift to the mscp, police cctv along walk way and lifts. I am lucky I reckon.

If there is a fire, and everyone simultaneously open their gates to escape, the opened gates from opposite units would become new "closed" gates blocking the entire corridor!  if there are 8 units there would be 4 "closed" gates to overcome when escaping!  Better buy parachutes....

I reckon the only solution to rectify this saga is for the hdb, mnd, scdf whatever to order the developer change all the metal gate. Sliding or centrally (50:50) swing gate. Current swing gate is 80: 20 I reckon. 
 
Of course some sort of monetary compensation as well. This whole saga will be sweep under the carpet.

simi investment banking - buy low sell high?
 

Other than the DBSS Pasir Ris One project, it is also involved in CityLife@Tampines, an executive condominium project in Tampines.
 In other words, SingHaiyi does not operate like traditional property developers, such as City Development or Far East Group, which take the full risk in a property development project. 
SingHaiyi is controlled by husband and wife, Gordon Tang and Chen Huaidan, both hailed from PRC. Its website saidSingHaiyi differentiates itself from its competitors with its strategy to focus on design and has adopted an “investment banking” approach towards property development.
 
This approach is essentially a syndication approach whereby SingHaiyi leads in identifying development projects or other related opportunities, sets the commercial parameters and then brings in co-investors and joint venture partners, playing as far as possible a lead or co-lead role for the duration of such projects.

On this note, do you think that there are currently private developments that also have 1.2m corridors but they don't talk about it, and reporters cannot suga suga go inside to measure? Maybe it's more common than presumed?
 
I know some play with the GFA by reducing corridors and giving private lifts (or a couple of units share one) instead. Then only need to provide short corridors.

Even Hong Kong government flat corridor also bigger than 1.2m. 
 
I visited my uncle's government flat in Tuen Mun, New Territories in Hong Kong.  The width of the corridor is bigger than this Pasir One DBSS and opposite also have neighbours staying. 
 
But his unit is damn small, smaller than our HDB one room flat.  No bedroom and small toilet.

Tear down and rebuilt bor kor ling lah.
 
But it will be interesting to see how to resolve this issue. At most developer declare bankrupt and case close. After all, developers usually form anew company to take on project. Once project completed, company also dissolve.

I feel sad for the people who bought Pasir Ris DBSS.  I am quite sure many of them are ordinary folks who believed they made a good investment.
 
What was shown in the show flat and what was actually sold was obviously worlds apart.  Thats also a downside for making a purchase on a unit that is to be constructed, based only on showflat review.  I am quite sure many of these flaws like the small corridor and internal defects would not be shown at the showflat.
 
In other countries, where such mis-representation is very glaring, residents can take out a class action lawsuite against the developer.
 
This option is still of cause theoretitcally available here, but only THEORITCALLY, as this is after a a govt project.  Most likely that any law suite would be dismissed. :(
 
After this episode, if i ever have money for a flat, i will buy only completed units that i can view.

Bro, no one will buy those units now.  Unless there is a 70% mark down.
 
Very sad case.
 
Who would have thought govt project can turn out like this? 
 
Imagine going home to this eye sore every day after work.
 
Make me appreciate my current pigeion hole even more.  My pigeon hole is old but the older units are actually bigger and better than new builds. 
 
Now adays the new units look more like coffins than shoe box flats.

this is troubling ... 
sounds like an opportunist investor with limited risk instead of a property developer ...
simi investment banking - buy low sell high?
 

It sounds like risk pooling and ring fencing of responsibilities.
 
Whereas if it is an outright HDB project, somebody has to stab his own kar chng with japanese bonsai pruning blade.
 
Like when the housing CDO instruments collapsed, the authorities had a hard trying to finger the correct culprit. In the end, just meaningless fines and a couple of high profile jail term.

On the other hand, if you don't due sufficient due diligence for such a big ticket item (dunno about you but, i buy 1 tray of eggs also i see abt 5 secs and if you extrapolate that to the cost of home...), maybe, just maybe, they deserve to be staying in the new EC with sexy corridors or sexy other things (depending on what rabbit is in the developer's hat).

Dated (due diligence) her for 3.5 years.
 
Only MRT/ Bus/ Night Rider Bus during our dates, no taxis. Sent her home after every date.
 
Makan only food court/ hawker centre for our dates. Makan at affordable restos only on birthday/ v day/ anniversary.
 
Went on a 3 week Aus trip towards the end of the 3 year mark (had a big bust up and made peace on the trip). Might not have popped the question if we did not have that bust up.

Not just EC. It is a trend that started around the time when the condo boom started. Time savings.
 
I am expecting to see them in my place when TOP. Toying with the idea of tearing it down and building a proper one.

I am very concerned with such poor workmanship. In the older days, the CEO or the owner of the development company would taken a bow and apologized in public. Some would have committed suicide, hara-kiri-style

	EC prices 'may fall but not by a lot'

Rennie WhangThe Straits TimesThursday, Mar 05, 2015

 20150123_amore_st.jpg
The Amore is one of the five projects launched from November to January. EC new sale prices have been rising over the last few years, but Mr Ong Teck Hui, JLL's national research director, expects prices to drop about 5 to 8 per cent as sales turn sluggish.

Home hunters hoping for big falls in executive condominium (EC) prices will probably need to be more realistic.
Experts expect prices to come under some downward pressure after recent low winning bids for EC sites by developers and weak sales in the segment.
But the experts say the overall picture is more complex, and that prices may not drop by a lot.
Many EC projects are on sites that were bought at higher prices earlier when the outlook was brighter, leaving developers with little room to manoeuvre now unless revenue margins are sacrificed.
Construction costs have also risen, and there may be higher costs associated with new prefabrication requirements from November last year.
Two recent EC site sales reflect the cooling market.
Last week, a Woodlands Avenue 12 site was sold for $103.8 million, or $278 per sq ft per plot ratio (psf ppr).
An Anchorvale Crescent site was sold for $157.8 million or $280 psf ppr in the same month.
Both were the lowest EC land prices since July 2011. At an average of $279 psf ppr, they were far below average EC land prices of $351 psf ppr last year, $360 psf ppr in 2013 and $321 psf ppr in 2012, a JLL analysis shows.
Breakeven costs for the two sites are expected to be about $650 psf.
"They can easily sell well below $800 psf and still make a decent margin," said Mr Ong Teck Hui, JLL's national research director.
In comparison, EC new sale prices have been on an upward trend over the last few years, hitting an average of $820 psf in the fourth quarter of last year, up from $783 psf in the same period of 2013 and $739 psf in 2012.
A total of 2,251 EC units that have been launched remain unsold, of which 1,831 are from the five projects launched from November to January: Bellewoods, Bellewaters, Lake Life, The Amore and The Terrace.
Consultants expect another 6,500 units or so to come onto the market from projects that have yet to be launched for sale.
"Softening prices of private homes (also) place a downward pressure on EC prices, if that gap between private homes and ECs is to be maintained to keep ECs attractive to buyers," said Mr Ong.
"With sluggish sales at current price levels, prices may have to be adjusted downwards by about 5 to 8 per cent to achieve significantly better sales take-up."
But while the latest EC sites have been sold at lower prices, construction costs have crept up slightly with foreign labour constraints and prefabrication requirements, said Mr Desmond Sim, CBRE research head for Singapore and South-east Asia.
Under these requirements, which kicked in from Nov 1, projects built on Government Land Sales (GLS) sites must meet higher building and constructability standards.
Developers bidding for GLS sites must also meet a certain level of prefabrication, such as using drywall as internal partitions in residential sites.
Although developers with lower land costs may price units lower to gain a competitive edge, their end products can still be put up for sale at the already benchmarked prices, with more room for discounts, said Mr Sim. "The latter is more favoured as it preserves the value of the whole development," he explained.

Zhun boh. Partition board for internal wall?? This not kurty want to block his living room from the door leh
 
Yes very zhun. In fact, this is the new construction standard. Developer HAS to follow for all new builds as it was made compulsory by BCA.
 
 

 
To further boost productivity and promote easier-to-build building designs and labour-efficient construction methods, certain types of new projects will also be required to adopt a range of pre-determined standardised floor heights and building components such as precast staircases, precast refuse chutes and doors from September this year. All residential non-landed developments will have to use drywall for internal partitions except for wet areas such as bathroom and kitchen areas. Requirements on buildable designs and use of labour-efficient construction methods will also be raised progressively to achieve greater productivity improvements (refer to Annex B (42KB .pdf)).

EC prices 'may fall but not by a lot'

Rennie WhangThe Straits TimesThursday, Mar 05, 2015


20150123_amore_st.jpg
The Amore is one of the five projects launched from November to January. EC new sale prices have been rising over the last few years, but Mr Ong Teck Hui, JLL's national research director, expects prices to drop about 5 to 8 per cent as sales turn sluggish.

Home hunters hoping for big falls in executive condominium (EC) prices will probably need to be more realistic.
Experts expect prices to come under some downward pressure after recent low winning bids for EC sites by developers and weak sales in the segment.
But the experts say the overall picture is more complex, and that prices may not drop by a lot.
Many EC projects are on sites that were bought at higher prices earlier when the outlook was brighter, leaving developers with little room to manoeuvre now unless revenue margins are sacrificed.
Construction costs have also risen, and there may be higher costs associated with new prefabrication requirements from November last year.
Two recent EC site sales reflect the cooling market.
Last week, a Woodlands Avenue 12 site was sold for $103.8 million, or $278 per sq ft per plot ratio (psf ppr).
An Anchorvale Crescent site was sold for $157.8 million or $280 psf ppr in the same month.
Both were the lowest EC land prices since July 2011. At an average of $279 psf ppr, they were far below average EC land prices of $351 psf ppr last year, $360 psf ppr in 2013 and $321 psf ppr in 2012, a JLL analysis shows.
Breakeven costs for the two sites are expected to be about $650 psf.
"They can easily sell well below $800 psf and still make a decent margin," said Mr Ong Teck Hui, JLL's national research director.
In comparison, EC new sale prices have been on an upward trend over the last few years, hitting an average of $820 psf in the fourth quarter of last year, up from $783 psf in the same period of 2013 and $739 psf in 2012.
A total of 2,251 EC units that have been launched remain unsold, of which 1,831 are from the five projects launched from November to January: Bellewoods, Bellewaters, Lake Life, The Amore and The Terrace.
Consultants expect another 6,500 units or so to come onto the market from projects that have yet to be launched for sale.
"Softening prices of private homes (also) place a downward pressure on EC prices, if that gap between private homes and ECs is to be maintained to keep ECs attractive to buyers," said Mr Ong.
"With sluggish sales at current price levels, prices may have to be adjusted downwards by about 5 to 8 per cent to achieve significantly better sales take-up."

The Sail condo right in our vaunted Marina Bay also has many many dry walls.
 
Never seen so many in unit before and after that, it seems like a norm liao for at least 1 wall to be dry wall.

Firstly, the concept of a sole agency in charge of public housing enabled more effective resource planning and allocation. This concept made it possible for HDB to secure land, raw materials and manpower for large-scale construction to optimize results and achieve economies of scale. Secondly, a total approach to housing was adopted - from planning and design to land assembly and construction. The housing task was viewed as a seamless whole - through allocation, management and maintenance.

Interior walls with bricks or concrete walls have STC of about 40, which is considered as “onset of privacy”, suitable within the residential units. The lightweight and dry partition walls have an STC of about 33 without any insulation. Adding insulation like rockwool in the wall cavity would increase the STC to between 45 - 50. Hence, unlike brick or concrete walls where the STC is limited to the choice of material, the dry partition walls have the ability to improve on the sound transmission loss by increasing the space and insulation between the boards to yield an STC of as high as 63.

Affordable may be relative but it should not affect QUALITY and VALUE...
 
We spend $550,000 which may be affordable to some but spending so much to buy such QUALITY...  
 
Might as well change to affordable homes of minimum quality and value, since they are building flats just to meet the minimum requirements...

eh, i don't really get it. Before signing on the dotted line, shouldn't one look through the floor plan of the entire floor? From there they should know where is the rubbish chute, stairway, lift, where their apartment is facing and of coz, how wide the corridor is. 
The quality, however is sibeh jialat. Dunno what the gas vent is for but it should not be running along the top of the corridor. Unless the design is going for an industrial look.  Hope the owners can have the rest of the issues resolved quickly.

In fact to get to the bathroom from these bedrooms you have to walk through the living room and sometimes the kitchen.
 
Shirely it's not beyond these designers to allow acess from the two other bedrooms straight into the bathroom.
 
Major fault imo.
Same in our 4 year old HDB 4 room.
 
Has it always been the same.  Our previous 30yo 4 room only had the one bathroom accessed through living room and whole length of kitchen

From photo, the corridor looks quite dark n narrow n looks unwelcoming for a home
 
If i m buying resale, I will give this a miss even if it's cheap which of coz won't be, people almost always profit (more or less) after 5 years
 
Prefer bright n sunny corridor, those that can grow plants are the best
 
I can grow my sunflowers, onions, curry leaves etc...

Even if they sell at their current price one may not want, unless it is really dirt cheap or one is buying to rent out.

the corridor look like a prison.
 
both house owners will bang their metal gates against each other every morning.
 
but hor, all these design should be in the brochure.
why no one point it out during purchase?
 
 


 
the corridor reminds me of those 公屋 (public housing) in Hong Kong. looks like the Hong Kong version is wider got enough clearance for two person side-by-side.

Probably not all walls will be built like this. Those hanging cabinets like I have on my living room can't be mounted on gypsum board lor
I mean if u put Rock wool then good lor. Maybe they will put trash paper inside the cavity

 
I already posted the link for you earlier but you might have missed it. For all new apartments, all interior walls (except toilet and kitchen) will need to be built using this drywall system.
 

 
To further boost productivity and promote easier-to-build building designs and labour-efficient construction methods, certain types of new projects will also be required to adopt a range of pre-determined standardised floor heights and building components such as precast staircases, precast refuse chutes and doors from September this year. All residential non-landed developments will have to use drywall for internal partitions except for wet areas such as bathroom and kitchen areas. Requirements on buildable designs and use of labour-efficient construction methods will also be raised progressively to achieve greater productivity improvements (refer to Annex B (42KB .pdf)).
http://www.bca.gov.s...032014_BCA.html

 
You can't mount your 80 inch tv or cabinets? Too bad lor. BCA claims it can be done with the drywall system (it's in the pdf I linked earlier as well).
 

For light and medium duty anchor for fixtures such as mirrors, light fitting or picture frames on drywalls, simply use screwdriver to insert and tighten the screw until secure. There is no need for hammer drills to make holes in concrete or brick and no unsightly chunks of concrete or brick breaking out through
imprecise workmanship.
 
The drywall system is also able to support heavy fixture such as large wall cupboards and heavy wall cabinets, but homeowners are advised to get contractors to carry out the installation work with proper heavy duty anchors.

Yes very zhun. In fact, this is the new construction standard. Developer HAS to follow for all new builds as it was made compulsory by BCA.
 
 
Jin jia lat, bid high high, greedy. Win bid already think of all ways to cut cost. End up still sell high high die die don't want to reduce price. In the end those people who buy the unit kanna poor workmanship,  poor design and so on. Complaint now got use meh? It's already built, some is cannot tear down and rebuilt leh. What government can do now is to further see what are the complaints of the residents and set further regulations to close all those loopholes that developers, contractors that they going to exploit. Hopefully authorities can also come out and set the ruling for usage of drywall. If not future building with all drywall in internal home really very jia lat leh. Really cost high high but reduced standard of living. Who will not get piss off? 
If developer kao peh cost of construction very high. Then ask them they must factor in this and don't bid so high in the 1st place. Cannot keep give in to developer one as it affects a lot of people who is going to buy the unit.  Once it is built, it is impossible to tear down and rebuilt again.

Agree with you
 
Seriously I think no Singaporeans will want n poor Singaporeans who bought a unit would want to get out after 5 years n most likely willing to sell at a loss too
 
Then hor, guess who would come n buy cheap? These people won't mind because the condition n built is still better than where they come from
 
All public housing should just be built by hdeebee, drop all these fancy schemes or atlas housing concepts
 
Should go back to basics, keep housing affordable, built with quality for every citizen 
 
& they should consider building bigger flats like last time, the size keep shrinking n quality of living drops too

Cost of HDB can be brought down if there is a heart to by the authorities. Unfortunately, money speaks loudest.
 
1. In cases of DBSS and EC, authorities can make the reserve price smaller.
2. Developers can learn from COE (cars) and don't be as stupid as drivers, bidding each other up the price, only to benefit the authorities but disadvantage the public
3. Do we really need all the frills? Frills (not quality usually) do cost money also

I really can't say whether BCA's brochure is accurate or not until I get my apartment and have my TV drop on my head but I find it out of this world that BCA should legislate what kind of "productive" materials a contractor should use. Shouldn't they leave it to market forces?
 
If one method is really more productive (and cheaper,better), then wouldn't developer's gravitate to it on their own? If developer's don't do it then it is either that consumers don't want it or it is not more productive.

My office used to have those expensive high quality board with holes and hooks to hang stuffs. The holes are on the rails which act as joints. We used to install shelves which can take many heavy files, etc, etc.... Really solid, but very expensive Scandinavian stuff, which defeats the purpose of cost-cutting as it costs more than bricks and concrete. LOL...
 
IIRC, it costs half a million more than 10 years back to import it in; excluding labour charges to install. 
 
I doubt any of our builders will use those in B&B homes.

Tear down and rebuilt bor kor ling lah.
 
But it will be interesting to see how to resolve this issue. At most developer declare bankrupt and case close. After all, developers usually form anew company to take on project. Once project completed, company also dissolve.

 
How about just move the gate and main door inwards into the living area, by 1 m?  Then just compensate (or good will) 1sq meter of living space to the owners.

My false ceiling is essentially a plasterboard with the steel frame.
If i can't hang a chandelier off it, i'd rather not hang a large LCD tv on it as well unless it's attached to a feature wall or cabinets that are anchored to the steel frame itself.
 
I find it ridiculous as well. But they want to focus on productivity rather than cost.
 
Anyway putting up a drywall is very easy. Just steel frame, fill up the inside and tack the plasterboards.
Easier than building ikea.

Drywall are cheaper and faster to build. The only good thing is that you can easily run utilities within the wall; in resident projects, it will mainly be electrical points and AC pipes. The thing is, the walls will be hollow and soft. Good luck if the movers accidentally hit the wall with your furniture. 
TVs and overhang cabinets are not classified under light or medium duty. You cannot mount directly onto the drywall. The contractors probably need to open up the wall, mount metal beams all the way to the floor, cover up and paint before doing the actual mountings.

bro i agree must do some background checks on developer, but pls remember this is a Govt led tender project.
 
This is not some fly by night build to order crap in Jay Bee.
 
Most of the folks who bought the units relied on the government to be involved and to maintain some minimum standards.  And i think this is a reasonavle expectation.
 
Otherwise what the hell is the govt's role here? Just sit back, select the lowest tender and collect tender fees and money? 
 
 
Moral of the storeyMust always do background check on developerBuy condo also the same, people don't blindly buyThey check and research which developer and the built quality is an important point of consideration

Looking at the corridor design is really eye sore...
 
But, the BCA or the SCDF rule also so vague... 1.2m... it did not spec whether for single side housing or double sided housing...
 
Even the designer of old rental HDB house, which is double sided, I stayed also use brain when designing... double side obviously required more than 1.2m...
 
It is not only the reason for SCDF for easy accessing... but also fire safely... the designer did not consider the amount of people escaping through the narrow corridor with the fastest time...
 
i think designer must be from China.... Why I say so is because, in China, when you buy a property, the lobby or the common walkway is shared among the number of households staying at that level... that why the designer bring their hometown idea in this project...

i think designer must be from China.... Why I say so is because, in China, when you buy a property, the lobby or the common walkway is shared among the number of households staying at that level... that why the designer bring their hometown idea in this project...
 
I really hope no people staying there borrow from Ah Long... just in case their runner set fire.. gone case liao... when everyone open gate to run for life... they have to play slalom run liao...
 

Good point on shared walkway
 
China's building n housing block all have 2 different fire exits which is accessible by every floor n not inter-connected for people to escape but hdeebee haven't learn this yet
 
Safely consideration for such narrow corridor here is flawed. 
 
Another thing is that China method to calculate sqm/unit is different from SG. They include access corridor, SG doesn't. So this narrowing of corridor makes no economical sense to owners pocket.

Do you want to live in a small house with big corridors or a big house with a small corridor ?
 
There..settled.

there was a period when many new wed couples apply for 5rm flat but most will move out at the end of MOP without any children, it is a waste of resources in a way.

that is not a waste of resource
 
another bigger family can move in 
 
i think HDB should just be honest for once and say that shrinking size is because they want to cut cost and maintain profit
 
why do u think HDB do not use PSF to compare price? Cos they like to show that a new "subsidized" $300k 90sqm flat is cheaper than the $350k 105sqm flat
 
just like when the hawker say price no change, but food portion actually reduced by 30%

making a quick buck is not a bad thing, if it is PRs who are paying for it since they are not entitled to BTO
 
but if they are making a quick buck from singaporeans' hard earn money who have to fight in the resale market because of insufficient new BTO
 
then i would say it is HDB's fault. If they have projected a steady supply of new flats, then resale prices would not have escalated more than a 100%

Not entirely sure how GFA is counted but another way to think of the DBSS. If widen all corridors to 1.5m but reduce the apartment floor area by 5 to 10% will it be an option that residents prefer? 
 
I think the next ruling by MND might be that all external floor plans by developers have to be declared? How much corridor space, garden and communal space area etc...

Given the bad publicity of Singhaiyi's DBSS project (not putting your client first), I would be wary of buying any of their development projects and at $800+psf, it is not exactly competitive against the other 4,300 unsold EC units islandwide.

Keeping the ball rolling as before will not lead to that end of the bell curve when the year end appraisal comes around.

Yeah. The DBSS pricing was out of whack when they were launched. 
 
When prices cool, I wonder how these units will be priced. 
 
It's easy to find a sucker  when the mkt is hot. 
 
Factor in when newer HDB gets build around the same area over time...
 
Next when selling if priced too low, seller buay kum wan and say my unit is DBSS, how can sell at hdb. But buyer will think you stupid carrot Mah, doesn't mean I'm one. 
 
If sellers price too high, buyers in the resale mkt will say seller siao, got cheaper hdb units nearby or top up a bit and get a nearby condo.

The cause of all these poor quality units are due to the extreme greed of the government. They give the project to the lowest bidder. So, whoever gets the job will have to cut cost and use the lowest quality materials to build (or never use at all as in the above case), shrink the sizes but sell at the highest price possible in order to make profit.
 
I will not be surprised if one day a whole building will collapse like a stack of cards. We surely are moving back to the 3rd world!

Just need to do the following
 
Sell all properties
 
Buy resale hdb and stay there for 30 months
 
Quit high income jobs 
 
Submit application for bto or dbss

Not so complicated if they really really want HDB. There are means and ways...
 
Of course, there is another group that always bites the tail of Govt because they feel that for such high salaries that the leaders command, everything must be swee swee. We must only get more and more over time, how can it be anything less?  
 
Anything and everything, the Govt will settle for them. If not, why would so much of their taxes be used for the governance?
 
But I am thinking also, can we hold the developers more accountable for these short cuts? Like withhold the last 5% of funds for more time (3 years?) until all these issues surface?

Depends on whether you use definition 1 (new definition) or 2 (classical definition). Definition 2 is definitely more objective.
 
  
1.   space that can be occupied or where something can be done. "there's only room for a single bed in there" synonyms: space, free space; More
    
  
2.   a part or division of a building enclosed by walls, floor, and ceiling. "he wandered from room to room" synonyms: archaicchamber   "he wandered around the room"       
Father: Do you have a room for me in your HDB?
Son: I don't have a room for you, but there is definitely lots of room.

Buy direct from government (HDB) bao earn one (provided after selling you still have a place to stay). You lived there until handling over IC also bao earn one 'cos you never loose. All other properties I dunno.
 
HDB sells you flats never use property agents one hoh (almost lah... somewhere in Y2005, they wanted to use agents to sell unsold flats).
 
Always take sales pitch with a mountain of salt.

if mkt tank, just wait another 5 yrs, if not another 5 yrs

Nonetheless, residents who face issues with the quality of the flats may report them to the Building Service Centre managed by the developer during the Defects Liability Period, Mr Lee said. If the developer fails to address them, the buyers will have legal recourse against the developer as provided for under the Sales and Purchase Agreement. 
“Although HDB is not a party to the S&P Agreement, HDB plays an active role in ensuring a fair and satisfactory outcome. When DBSS flat buyers raise concerns or feedback about DBSS units, HDB will ask the developer to take appropriate action,” he said.

For DBSS projects, the HDB only sets buyer eligibility rules and provides broad planning parameters such as the mix of flat sizes and the range of facilities.
But that is not to say that the HDB does nothing at all, he said. With the Trivelis DBSS project in Clementi, for instance, HDB "worked behind the scenes" with the developer to seek a resolution.

This one probably external wall waterproofing not done properly. Encountered this in my sengkang flat 15 years ago.
Very easy just report HDB, they will get contractor to put up gondola and waterproof external wall.  
Of course parquet flooring will be sayang lah

My old apartment kenna also like that but not so bad , just that after 25-30 years the walls inside started to get mouldy and no matter how many times I painted after about every 6-8 months from inside also could not arrest the issue; I even put silicon on the windows from outside - where the cement meets the aluminium frame- helped a little;  On the 35th year kenna en-bloc and I thought I got peace and move in to another apartment and another issue of water seepage from the ceiling. Peoples life is getting longer but buildings are getting really bad nowadays with everything concealed, Water is damn clever one - come in from don't know where and seep out from some place else where there must be some weakness in the concrete

I know and brought it up to the Management but they just foot drag (since its an old condo) and because they were in "enbloc" mood that time having failed twice , so they start foot dragging and I also did not want to bother since the area was about like 1m x 2m - must be joint between floors giving way maybe with some crack in between  (just my thinking only) and I had moved out and rented the place to low end tenant whom did not bother - "on as is where is condition" and move out once if en bloc was announced with some 3 months notice - so i also sort of "boh chap"

TOC got some kpkb article about Choa Chu Kang BTOs now, popped up on my FB page this morning.
 
Got some pictures of skirting used being totally different from samples shown prior to purchase (does HDB really charge $5,900 for wooden skirting?).
 
 
Edit: It's TOC so pinch of salt might be required, which is why I'm not linking the article here.

It's probably floor + skirting + doors.
Floor + doors was about close to 5k for mine.
My skirting is quite ugly also. Painted over it during my renovation.

the skirting leaves a lot of glue behind also on the homogeneous tiles...
 
Until today (>10 years), those glues are still there. Damn difficult to remove also.

These MPs really clueless or wayang?
 
DBSS also unofficially scraped. Still need to call for it to be officially abolished?
 
Maybe after MBT loses the election, his buddy KBW can come out to admit it was a silly mistake and officially abolish it  
 
 
More calls for abolishing DBSS
 

Jul 23, 2015
 
 
 
Some Members of Parliament (MPs) have renewed calls for the Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) to be abolished or tweaked due to the blurred lines of accountability as well as low public confidence in project quality, reported Today Online.
 
Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC MP Hri Kumar Nair said in a Facebook post last week that he hoped the scheme would be permanently shelved. In 2011, the building of new DBSS flats was suspended following public outcry over the high prices at Centrale 8 in Tampines.
While he acknowledged the intent behind the scheme – which is to bridge the gap between public and private housing – Mr Kumar said confusion could have arisen over the obligations of the housing board.
 
“Because this is public housing, the expectation is that not only will HDB oversee the development, they’re supposed to work with the developer to resolve all defects. And because there is such an expectation, there is also disappointment when that did not happen,” he noted.
 
His comments come after several MPs aired their concerns in parliament over the role of HDB in resolving disputes relating to defects in DBSS projects. Some even questioned the scheme’s future, prompting Minister of State for National Development, Desmond Lee to state that there is no need to rush into making a decision when market conditions may change.
 
Holland-Bukit Timah GRC MP Liang Eng Hwa also made the call to scrap the DBSS. He shared that while it was well-intended, problems rose when the final product failed to meet the expectations of residents.
 
Moreover, the slowdown in the private property market has made such homes within the reach of more Singaporeans.
 
“With prices coming down, there may not be a need for a separate category (of housing),” said Liang, who also serves as deputy chair of the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for National Development and Environment.
 
Meanwhile, Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC) noted that newer Build-to-Order (BTO) projects are now catching up in terms of quality.
 
“If you look at today’s public housing projects, the design is already quite impressive. It’s time to streamline,” he revealed in reference to Punggol Northshore, a BTO project that features smart homes.

Bro, this pic still looks ok. I kaypo kaypo went to take a look at pasir ris when i passby one night, the corridor is really pathetic. I am sure i felt worse than stock market crashing if i were to buy the flat. Just cannot imagine paying 500-700k for such a flat. Even those 1-room old fkats had much bigger corridors. And the low lying ceiling with the gas or air pipes do not help at all. The claustophobic atmosphere is maxed!

I am not sure whether got design. But the DBSS I have seen elsewhere have some kind of interesting designs that deviate from HDB. At least not rectangular shaped. Some might like it.
 
Hardly any design means have design. 1 choice taken.

Yes you are right but I don't see it solely as the developer's fault. I see this as BCA / HDB fault too.
 
I am sure all documents including floor plans with detailed dimensions were submitted for approval.

Great choice. It's an important criteria for me as well.
 
Many have argued that there is a growing number who can cope with small spaces. I think it is also fair having visited and lived in some. 
 
Much depends on one's personality.
 
Corridor space is even more controversial. But I believe that narrow corridors just meeting the minimum will get more common in the future maybe in some ECs or private condos if the land the developer bought is expensive.

I think those buyer wise up now, complain also to contractor only, not blow it up in media..the larger they blow it up, the faster their value drop in future when times up for resale market.., better keep quite and 5yrs later, quickly sell it away to those who didn't know their problems... Hehe...

屋主申诉59万买四房式私人组屋, 房间小像“鞋盒”
14/10/2015 on 新明日报
By 林礼颖
 
 

陈女士表示两间客房小如“鞋盒”，只能放下一张单人床。（受访者提供）
 
女郎申诉买下巴西立的四房式私人组屋后，发现空间太局限，一家七口或需要轮流吃饭，而房间更犹如“鞋盒”般大小，需要砸近4万元装修。
 
陈女士（36岁，保险索赔主管）今年3月买下位于巴西立1通道的私人组屋Pasir Ris One的一个四房式单位（面积86平方米），并称居住环境让她大失所望。
 
“我打算和妈妈、弟弟、弟媳及其两名侄儿和女佣一起入住，我和妈妈住主人房，弟弟和弟媳睡一间，两名侄儿则和女佣睡另一间客房。”
 
岂料，陈女士发现客房小如“鞋盒”，只能放一张单人床，而主人房也只能放一张双人床（Queen Size），无法顺利入住。

Wow... 86 sqm is even smaller than standard HDB 4 room flats...
 
For condo, they will have balcony(ies), wet/dry kitchen, laundry yard, maid's accommodation, extra toilets etc..
 
How big can each 'condo' feature have in 86 sqm?

I have gone inside a DBSS before. The 86 sqm likely includes balcony maybe 6 sqm plus minus which makes it really small inside. Else 86 sqm maybe still not that small.

to be honest ... i don't blame the buyer 100% although one should do due deligent
i went to several show rooms especially 2-bedder and 3-bedder
it seems "acceptable" ... ok what ... can accept
then when colleague got house warming ... walao eh ... 3-bedder condo small like mickey mouse house
 
at showroom ... all the things was done nicely and place "strategically" ... hide all the services and corners ... make it look big
i believe furniture, bed, etc probably also custom made
for a normal family ... once they move in with their barang barang ... ho say liao
 
in showroom ... the master bedroom built in closet probably can put 10 clothes only ... muahahahaha

due diligence include eyes open big big, bring along a measuring tape, knowing what type of furniture are needed.
 
I also visit these showroom, one look you know many furniture and fixture was not display, all rooms are neatly and nicely do up......  hello we dun stay in such condition 100%, not even 10% of the time lor. 
 
there bound to be mess most of the time, they need room to sweep into or under 
 
but many go visit showroom only thinking of budget, once budget is met, they will act impuslively and forget about the measurements.

Pasir Ris 4-room DBSS flat 'too small' for family of 7

Last time many families had huge altars, large desktop computers, gigantic CRTV, complicated kitchen for cooking. 
 
I would think that many modern families might not need most of that. True?
 
 

 
Kitchens really some are ridiculous. Maybe can only prepare microwaved meals.
I find my kitchen quite difficult to cook. Cos the countertop space is limited. no space to put stuff when preparing the meals.
Then see my sis new place, half my kitchen size only

ah common mistake here. must have misunderstood sqm as sqkm, her first intention must be inviting her whole block to stay together in her unit.
it not uncommon for people not used to space as well as what 86 square meter is like.
 
I tried telling my wife that a shoe box apt is like 2 parking lots stitch together.
 
Her thoughts were I was too extreme or unrealistic with my estimates.
 
I further told her if you put walls thickness in, it would be even smaller and hence not practical.
 
So we actually visited the showflat and she did indeed found it small, but yet still find it practical. Until I told her that the beds are customized or deem queen size when in fact they are not. I also ask her to spot missing items.
 
She did not realized that doors were omitted and that balcony was an imaginary line which did not belong in the bigger scheme of things.
 
There were some argument as her heart was set on getting a reasonably price condo.
 
So I had to do damage control by visiting some shoe box apt that was already ready for rent.
 
Only then did she relented and abandon the idea.
 
so while 86sqm is not small, it can really only fit 2 or at best 2 plus two small children. And if your DNA for both of you is small and your wife did not hanky panky, your grown up teenager will be small and should fit quite nicely.
 
When HDB chief kimosabi shared that HDB now build based on space utilization, I knew then that the 4 room flats would become a 3 room size of older design into 4 room flats.
 
Its abit like char koay teow 2 dollars becoming 3 dollars but even then the amount of noodles has being reduce for your own good because you cannot be trusted to keep fit and the hawker continues to earn more because they deserve to..

In 1985, I bought a HDB 4rm simplified flat of 85sq m in Hougang Ave 4, neighbour's 4rm Model A flat was 104sq m.
 
Bedrooms were of almost the same size as my neighbour's but my storeroom was in the kitchen so it became smaller and his hall was at least 50% bigger than mine. Otherwise, it was liveable.
 
Trouble with DBSS flats are they sometimes have bay windows, balconies, planters and bigger than norm air-con ledges and that's why I believe I could live in my normal Hougang HDB flat whilst the DBSS guys can't. I know that balconies are desired lifestyle additions these days but give me a bigger interior space anytime!!

i think she is just try to pull a fast one no the renovation cost...
Come on is she that dumb or what. Everyone with common sense will know 86sqm is small and certainly cannot fit 7 pax. At most 3-4 pax or die die want try your best to add the 5th person ba.

My parent in-law's 4rm HDB of 90 sqm has housed 6 adults very comfortably. It was built around 2000 or so.
 
The furnitures are old school and huge, huge TV console, huge coffee table, huge altar, huge shoe cabinets (not built in) and last time CRTV. Still comfortable space for all.
 
Other than the balconies and planters etc eating into usable floor space, I suspect the old HDB calculations of floor space did not include the aircon ledges (another 2 sqm easily), as the inclusion into floor space was from the last few years. I could be wrong though.
In other words, "给我一点好处我就静静，不然你就惨了！"
 
Maybe just drag in brother and sister to create more drama and leverage.
 
This room is potentially very long with build in wardrobe?
 
Other bedrooms like master bedrooms?
 
Must see the big picture to conclude. Maybe the unit is designed as a 2+1 format, and this is the study room or helper's room.

Not take side but I don't quite agreed with what the spokesman mentioned. Visited a number of show flats before, and everytime I asked for actual room size (length & width info), were always told it is not available as the plan is still subjected to approval by relevant authorities. Most of the time the agent will just point me to the floor plans in the brochure to have an idea of how "big" is the room. In the best case scenerio, I will be told the estimated area of the room, that all.
 
And to make thing worst, show flats are specially done up to give buyer the illusion of how "spacious" the room is, with door and walls omitted, customized furniture set, and the extensive use of mirror. In the case of this Pasir One DBSS, this is how the same room in the show flat look like. I dare to say that if you are not in building / construction realted industries, you will be not be able to visualize at the first look how small is the room.
 

 
Do you get my point now?

in this case it is not misleading, the picture already show one bed in the room and it has to be build above the study desk, there is no illusion that the room is small.

Some of the balconies are too narrow to fit in a table though they are long enough.
From the floor plan shown, the master bedroom balcony is definitely the type I'm talking about and you can't have breakfast there unfortunately, so it's actually redundant. 
 
The Living Room balcony maybe possible though.

Your point is sharp indeed.
 
Must ask the agent whether developer building all those structures for you.
 
If not (and signed on paper) then don't bother. Because the loft beds are quite expensive to build so most people get keys will not bother. There are also some regulations regarding what can or cannot be built.
 
Some showflats even build the extended space and charge you PSF for the additional space, but do not built the loft or additional space. Must really go in with both eyes open and mind open, and make sure it is in the contract.

I dare to say that if you are not in building / construction realted industries, you will be not be able to visualize at the first look how small is the room.

If i were the developer i will ask her to buzz off, don't waste everybody's time

Do you get my point now? 

No matter what , she was fully informed.
Whether she can visualise or not is her problem.
 
Everyone knows that they use mirrors and stack up cabinets to make spaces look bigger.
Thats space planning and ID.  
 
Unless the developer did not build to specs, otherwise ms tracy tan should just f**k off.
Or else everyone can go complain and get a refund too

In 1985, I bought a HDB 4rm simplified flat of 85sq m in Hougang Ave 4, neighbour's 4rm Model A flat was 104sq m.
 
Bedrooms were of almost the same size as my neighbour's but my storeroom was in the kitchen so it became smaller and his hall was at least 50% bigger than mine. Otherwise, it was liveable.
 
Trouble with DBSS flats are they sometimes have bay windows, balconies, planters and bigger than norm air-con ledges and that's why I believe I could live in my normal Hougang HDB flat whilst the DBSS guys can't. I know that balconies are desired lifestyle additions these days but give me a bigger interior space anytime!! 

 
Yeap, my old 4A was 105 sq m.
And it still looks small.

in this case it is not misleading, the picture already show one bed in the room and it has to be build above the study desk, there is no illusion that the room is small.
 
and yet she try to put 3 pax in the room  

 
with this size of head room. Better have crash course in karma sutra or have a Peni$ embargo . worst case is prepared to wind back the time to 50 years back and play jap invasion with hiding in the confines of bunker for as long you own the flat and be awarded for best CD shelter of the year.

As just a regular guy who lives by myself and does my own housework, the following popped into my head in the specific order:
 
1. NBCCB how the fark you expect me to change the bedsheets???
 
2. Climb up the ladder/desk/ladder liao then what? Leopard crawl into bed?!??
 
3. Everytime you stand up from the desk you will tio baluku from hitting your head on the underside of the bed.
 
People no common sense or what?

I think anyone taking a look at the floor plan should know that room is actually not an actual room, since it is only half the size of a normal size masterbedroom.

 
You can see the room width is less than 2 doors' width..... the doors are really big!

Recently we did the printing and binding for an Australian condo development
 
Each individual sales agreement was 200+ pages
 
EVERY SINGLE UNIT had a plan of the individual floorplan WITH MEASUREMENTS.
 
I still don't understand why we can't do that here.  
Govt is too "easy" on developers, and developers take advantage of this 
 
And looking at that plan - if the balconey is included in the floor area - can faint and die one! 
calling those that know - are balconey included in the GFA for the development surcharge?

Eh---
 
But got full size wall mirror!! 
 
Kinda kinky what..
 
Looking at the plan again I just noticed TWO balcony 
 
Which no doubt included in the 86 square metre

Seriously - 
 
I have looked into this before - 
 
Developers don't have to provide measurements.  
 
To my mind - if cannot provide exact dimensions for every room on the plan for the exact unit you are buying - then it is simply WRONG. 
 
Problem is - everyone does this, nowhere in Singapore do you get the measurements.  HDB should be leading the way here - when you look at your plan, it should have all the measurements on it.  If cannot provide the measurements, then people shouldn't buy. 
 
It is beyond time for the regulator to step in on this. 
 
And I don't accept any complaints about "too hard" or whatever - I simply cannot believe that the architect doesn't have the exact measurements for every part of the development - the only reason not to include is to "obscure" what is being bought - 
 
eg - is the aircon ledge included in floor area?  What about the protruding bay window?

i know some people are quite poor at looking at anything on paper.  so I guess this lady being featured belongs to those.  give them how comprehensive floor plans also no use.  and most likely she would have viewed the showroom as well?  she can only blame her own gullibility.  most of us can get a good estimate just by knowing it is 86sqm and comes with 2 balconies, it is going to be very squeezy on the living space.
 
can't really blame the contractor also.  there's a loophole in the rules and so they just makes good use of it to maximise their profit. 
 
but I do agree, any contractor that choses to build 2 balconies for a 86sqm unit isn't motivated to build a good living space but more to squeeze  profit.

Balcony, planters, aircon ledges are considered as bonus GFA.
 
I think they are not included in development surcharge? Not very sure too, but the ruling to include them in sales prices and saleable area took place in the last five-six years.

she expect 86 sqm / 926 sqf to be how big ah?
 
1000 sqf should be 2bdrm apartment, her's even smaller size and partition out into 3bdrm, some more less A/C ledge & balcony, etc,
she expecting big bedrooms?

Essentially, small means small. Singapore also tiny, but it doesn't hinder us from being giants in our own ways.

Occasionalyy when selling my Rolexes, i also come across some ngeow chee ngeow lan type.
 
Kns, $5k used watch, expect it to be completely flawless without any scratches yet want to ask for cheap cheap price.   Even shop also dont want to sell to such people. 
 
Quite a few months ago, met one such buyer.
Price everything confirm already, come down to view.
Watch is exactly as per description and all pictures.
But ngeow chee ngeow lan, reoffer lower. 
I thanked him , took the watch and never looked back.
In the end sold it for the price i wanted to a Vietnamese Aussie buyer who came to Singapore.
 6mths later, today, the watch has risen in price by about 15-20%
 
Moral of the story?
Dont be ngeow chee ngeow lan.
And Buy watch from Throttle, confirm steady, dont worry.

Maybe their faces are shown at every counter and all cashiers are trained to recognize them on sight. 
 
Actually the ban is there so that if they make trouble again, the manager can easily id them and tell them to GTFO instead of entertaining their complaints.

For example, some owners complained of colour inconsistencies in timber floors, which are inevitable as timber is a natural organic product. Residents have also complained of minor variations in floor tiles, which may differ slightly from batch to batch according to HDB.

 
Huh.... Inconsistencies in timber flooring and "minor variations" in floor tiles are two different matters.
 
Everyone knows timber will have some natural patterns but how can we accept it if our flooring is in 2 different tones (or more) just because they come from a different batch?

just saw the 6.30pm news that a new BTO flat waterpipe burst and flooded several floors
and the conclusion ... oh ... it's still under 1-year warranty and the problem will be fixed ... duh!

Stomp = can get $$$ for stomping.
 
Case = must pay $$$ before can lodge complaint.

I know is an old post but i cannot tahan to say this.
 
Our "leader" say HDB housing is affordable lei. they using a different calculation method. (pun intended)

 
wow. 750k for a DBSS.
 
based on 80%/ 150k DP. we can assume
 
1. the couple work at least 5 yrs.
2, approx 30yrs old.
3. base on 12k salary. each max out CPF contribution abt 1.2k each.
4. loan 25 yrs
5. monthly repayment abt 2.7 @ 2.6% interest 
 
so by the time they are 55yr old. their CPF will be close to zero. 
 
they need to sell their flat for 1.11 M to break even. 
 
anything less than 1.1M they will not have any cash on hand because they will need to repay CPF for the interest .
 
so worse case scenario. at 55 less than 10 yr to retirement. they will have almost nothing in the CPF and a house which they would need to sell for more than 1.1M in order to see any cash.
 
quite scary don't you think?

Same developers as Pasir Ris One where one was killed in a mobile crane accident. Could the developers be jinxed? From the ST today.Olivia HoA driver was crushed to death by his parked oil tanker on Friday, when it unexpectedly rolled forward and pinned him against a wall.Singaporean Chun Kum Soon died in the accident at the construction site of Sengkang executive condominium The Vales.Police said they received a call for help at around 3.30pm from the Anchorvale Crescent site.A spokesman said: "Upon arrival, it was established that an industrial accident had occurred and a 42-year-old man was pronounced dead by paramedics at the scene." He added that investigations are ongoing.According to Shin Min Daily News, Mr Chun had parked the oil tanker next to a wall and alighted to refuel an excavator.The vehicle suddenly rolled forward and pinned him against the wall before he could escape.When The Sunday Times visited the site yesterday, a Bangladeshi traffic controller said the ground where the accident occurred was uneven, and the vehicle's handbrake might not have been engaged, causing it to slide.Some members of the victim's family were at the site at about 4.30pm yesterday to conduct funeral rites, accompanied by a Buddhist monk.Relatives guided Mr Chun's four-year-old son in offering joss sticks as the monk chanted verses over a yellow T-shirt and trousers belonging to the victim, spread out on the ground where he died.Mr Tommy Yu, a neighbour of the Chuns in Woodlands, said Mrs Chun was not present as "she would not have been able to control her emotions".He added: "She has been sobbing non-stop since collecting her husband's body on Friday."Mr Yu is chairman of volunteer group Love & Unity Volunteers Establishment, which is seeing to the funeral arrangements for the family.Although he did not know Mr Chun personally, he said he was moved to help by the plight of his widow, who is in her 30s, and young son. "(Mr Chun) was the sole breadwinner. How will they continue without him?"The developers of The Vales are SingHaiYi Group and Kay Lim Holdings Joint Venture, while its builders are China Construction (South Pacific) Development. Neither could be reached for comment yesterday.

EC got penthouse unit?


准新娘158万买EC阁楼, 厨房“无窗”一雨成灾
11/02/2016 on 新明日报
By 萧佳慧
 
谢梅英指，女儿的158万元阁楼单位问题多，厨房竟无窗遮掩。（吴承沄摄）
25岁准新娘花158万元购买阁楼执行共管公寓，岂料厨房“无窗”遮掩，雨天酿水患，担心新房“泡汤”。
 
准新娘的母亲谢梅英（55岁，补习老师）代为受访时告诉记者，25岁的女儿2012年买下实龙岗北执行共管公寓鹭鸶苑（Heron Bay）的阁楼单位，内有四个房间的单位要价158万元。
 
谢梅英透露，女儿定在下个月结婚，去年11月拿了钥匙，原本打算去年底迁居入伙，如今却担心新家会“泡汤”。
 
原来，去年圣诞前夕一场大雨之后，这对准新人发现，厨房积水淹至客厅，因为单位的厨房没有窗户。

You are right that this should not be allowed to be built in an EC project. Under current rules, cannot already.
 
No dual key w/o extended family, roof terrace area comes under GFA, and unit size capped at 160m2 (i think)

I feel worried when i go to these condos with glass balconies. They aren't shatter proof glass like our windscreens right. Only tempered glass.
 
So the glass could shatter and u may fall through...

Different la.
 
Previously it wasn't counted under GFA at all. Now they changed it so it is counted under the free 10% GFA given for balconies (and now patio+roof).

I am not sure about this case, but yes, there were instances where people bought houses much later after the showroom units had been torn down. They would just rely on photos and pics they see from the brochures. Something like the leftover/balanced units. So it is not easy to visualize every detail of the house.

Came across this and I feel it is a good read to share:

Open kitchen concept 
 
The developers told the Chinese-language newspaper that the kitchen was designed with an airy open concept in mind - and is commonly seen in homes today.
 
When home owners bought units in the EC, they signed an agreement not to install any other fixtures without the developers' approval.
 
However, in view of different tenant's needs, the developers have allowed home owners to install additional windows or grilles.

These days it is not which developer has problems but which developer has the fewest problems.
 
Combination of buyers getting more anal (because we are paying through the nose) and builders using cheaper materials.

From the linked article:
 
According to Shin Min, the unit's design is such that the kitchen has windows and grilles but it is linked to an open concept balcony which does not have any windows to keep rain out.
 
They should be able to close the kitchen windows, right?

Developer will just want to maximize their profits .... 
But once some set bad examples, hopefully ppl will remember and boycott their projects...
Why buy a unit and then your home is full of craps and defects .... so much so that instead of bringing joy, you just don't want to move in and stay ....

They will register a company for the warranty period.
 
After the one year is up, they closed the company.

This is baffling to me.. If I buy goods from manufacturer, and the goods is defective.. I cannot chase damages from manufacturer, but have to go pursue the seller's sub-contractor??  what logic is this??

I cannot chase damages from manufacturer, but have to go pursue the seller's sub-contractor??  what logic is this??  Nowadays products' quality are getting more and more sloppy. The products that my company sell from reputable brands in UK and USA standard also dropping. The brands are not willing to adsorb the freight cost for warranty also.  
Making it very tough for us as we have to adsorb. I guess if the scale goes bigger, many resellers also have it tough if the manufacturer don't want support. Better get from China since quality about the same and cost of the product from China so cheap that 1 to 1 exchange not much loss.

by our courts' logic.. Kawasaki should have told SMRT to go after the aluminum supplier since the train hairline cracks were due to impurities in the aluminum alloy..

Yup. Exactly who is the !@#$%^&*( who enacted this law?
Those bloody developer made $$ and then will disappear into thin air. And next day, got another development and so set up another company to fleece the buyers again with the same sub-standard works...
 
Time to bankrupt them to make good all the shoddy things they accepted...

Wat jover chew. This one jiak so much monies woh. Make jover chew looms amartuesh
Symphony Suites (Yishun) is currently 305 units sold, representing 46% of total 660 units, with 355 units still unsold (source: URA website).  EL Development (ELD) has until Mar 2019 to sell all before the 5-year ABSD penalty hits it.  The average price for this development is $1,044 psf.(source: Edge Property Website).
 
With this negative publicity of ELD, it is going to be difficult to move sales from now on. 
 
I hope the management of ELD really makes sure that this incident of glaring defects does not repeat for their current on-going projects: Symphony Suites and Parc Rivera (West Coast Vale).
 
Parc Rivera is going to be launched soon (it has been 1 year since its land was procured) and we shall see how the buyers' responses are to it, a test of their confidence.
 
Maybe ELD has to sell at a lower than expected price?
Its located just next to win 5 and northview n northpoint.... industrial estate and mile over to yishun mrt.
