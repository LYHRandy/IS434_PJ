A family (just husband and wife) with a total saving of 600k cash and total CPF of 200K. and with a combine income of around 7K take home salary. 
 

putting aside 80K cash for renovation. 
 

How will you allocate the down payment?

And will you go for private property or HDB?

That's a lot of cash you have. Should put them in bonds or investments. It depends how much you want to be left with after buying the new HDB and how much you want to loan. 
 

If I'm in your shoes, I will buy a HDB flat using up all the CPF. The rest take loan. Then use the cash to buy a private property. Take another loan. Rent out the private property to pay for the monthly mortages of both HDB and private.

honestly $7k combined is quite pathetic in todays context.

so all depends on how big a place they want and how big a burden they can take on shoulders.
 

If I were them , I would get a big HDB and feel very comfortable.

Downpay at least $300k - $400k or about half of the cash + cpf they have.

Life will still be very comfortable and things would be stable.

well within means and have money to invest in other things.
 

whats the point of a small (public) private property [also known as mass market private property (usually nestled in HDB estates anyway...)]

And have to live with hordes of upstarts and CMIs as neighbors. 
 

So , flame me but thats the truth....

take home 7k but cash reserve 600k... it must be your 20yr? life savings.

i can't advice much cos i'm no financial guru, but pls be prudent.. check out forums for alternate views then draw your conclusion. (personally i won't do it.. too expensive now)
 

not easy to save this amount, unless that 600k is toto winnings

i wonder how 7k combined income can appear with another 600k cash.

even if you save up 100% without spending and without cpf, with a 7k combined income, it will take 7.14 years to hit 600k.
 

anyway, i would suggest you to go for HDB EM/EA/EC or maximum, a 99 years neighbourhood condo.

i am suggesting such because the combined income is really too low to consider a private property.

just my two cents worth.

ok, 20 years... That's still good savings compared to lots of other couples.
 

No kids?
 

Think buy HDB flat, use up the CPF, use half the cash, that will mean you buy a place that is max 550k.
 

The rest keep for rainy days.

He and wife saved up and 250k from sale of flat lah.
 

Actually the CPF can lah. Me already got ~240k (balance + CPF used for property) working about 12 years.
 

But me don't have 600k cash. Wonder how's the feeling to see the bank account so thick. Maybe I should make that my new target; to have thick thick bank account!

Buy hdb or at most ec. With 20 yrs saving, I believe u are at least mid 40s. Buy a hse below 1 mil n quickly pay up asap, so that u hv the next 15 to 20 yr to save up for retirement.

At 40s I will advice against taking a loan. 600k cash, 200k CPF, just buy a 550k flat since couple without kids.
 

Cash keep for rainy days, at most next time really good investment opportunity/timing I alert all at mcf, so you can double that.
 

2 person working with 7k income should just keep it safe.

since you are renting your flat and you cannot buy another flat.

i would suggest you to keep your current flat and continue with the rental.
 

it is always good to own another property. however, from the "20yrs" of hard saving, i reckon you both are not young.

you got to ask yourself and your wife, whether to safe keep the savings and spend some on vacation or hiong hiong get another property.
 

if i were you, i will hiong hiong get another property since you got some $$$ to play with and also, rental amount to top up for the outstanding loan.

if $$$ problem arises and worst case, sell either one of your houses lo. you know, property investment usually will never go wrong.

I will pay the standard rate of down payment, & loan, & slowly build the house, adding things over the time, that should relaxed on the pocket a bit. 
 

I have a lot of ideas how my house & garden will look like in my mind, but I should do some sketching over how it will look (ok, tomorrow I will go libary to get some inspiration since I am on leave now, very eng). Every time, I visited a friends & colleague house, I get more ideas, but I need to keep it real, as I can't have it all.

at minimum for retirement, he needs to have a house to rent out for passive income (if he has no other revenue generating income at old age), then look for a nearby place to stay.. jb or other parts in malaysia to stretch his retirement funds further.
 

so.. imo, get a hdb (or small condo) to rent out, then get one in malaysia for stay.

every month come back sg to collect rent. going by current exchange (2.4), collect sg rent S$2k = RM4.8k

good enough lah. of course, need to calculate the roi. 

if it is a RM500k (S$208k) property, he can break-even in 8.6yrs using his sg house to pay the morgage. 
 

just a crude illustration.. he got to do more deeper calculations to see if it really works out for him

if it were me, assuming not young, and have no more plan to have children, i will buy a small hdb, like 3 rooms or smaller, pay with cpf and loans. The remaining cash use for investment in good companies, for their dividend and liquidity. then spend some money regularly for holidays or something u enjoy, goes into pre-retirement immediately (with a job).

there is some missing information....

1) how old is the couple 

2) how much is the mthly expenses.. given that it's only 2 persons , it shld be min. Do they have high car loan or expecting to have a child. 
 

if couple is above 40, i suggest hdb as there shld not be significate growth in salary. Pay up most of the house and any spare cash can consider investing on fixed income. And plan for a carefree retirement.

If you have NOT attended MY FULL course on..'Who you can rent your premise to and profit handsomely from it'..
 

You can forget about renting it out or else you might land up like the person who had to fork BIG amount of legal fees to settle her tenancy dispute problems!

hvg said that, there is nothing stable in this world...



 

You wrong liao...
 

Stabilty is how you perceive and create it....although the 'outside environment' cannot be guaranteed...you can minimise the risk substantially...and use that chance to create the stability of your own ..
 

THEREAFTER YOU ARE THE ONE WHO CALL THE SHOTS!

That's right, there is nothing wrong living in a hdb flat, living a simple life, enjoying the fruits of your labour by taking cheap holidays. I see alot of rich people, have so much money but so unhappy and have to come forums to diss people and haolian on their wealth and put people down.

1. 40s

2. car fully paid. no kids. monthly total out going about $3.5k.



 

I think a 4 or 5 rm flat is sufficient. It may cost about 500-600K range depending on location. Full settle it and keep the remaining cash. Continue with your current lifestyle, don't change car. Use the next 15 yrs or so to save up for retirement. Should be no issue for u.
 

Having seen some of my friends playing with their only property, i can only say it is LPPL. It comes back to square one. It is always impt to settle your first roof before u decide to play property game.

If still entitle to buy from HDB, buy HDB. It is a sure win toto. Easily $100k in 5 years. 

If new flat is $500k, CPF 200k all in, top up cash 50k, loan $250k.

Payback in 15 years. Monthly $1700 can service using CPF.

Keep the cash for other investment.

not sure where to start. lets say...
 

A family (just husband and wife) with a total saving of 600k cash and total CPF of 200K. and with a combine income of around 7K take home salary. 
 

putting aside 80K cash for renovation. 
 

How will you allocate the down payment?

And will you go for private property or HDB?



 

definitely HDB, the 7K take home can be taxing if they get private assuming they would also like to take holidays and have a lifestyle without eating into the 520K reserves, this 520K can be very useful when at the good moment to enter market, 520K cash in a safe FD account can yield a good safe-bet return. 
 

IMHO.

Depends on HOW you perceive this $7k..
 

His S$7k are very stable jobs for both of them..and will be more as years go by..more or less confirm....as I can gather from my 8th sense!..
 

Your more then $7k as a table wiper.... come and go...
 

There is a vast difference between the two especially if years go by....
 

Since you always like to 'talk down' to ppl who has a modest amount of money..
 

I will also be able to 'talk down' to you as you will have perceived by now!

2. car fully paid. no kids. monthly total out going about $3.5k.



 

hmmm let me do a simple calculation for you..

600k - 250k cpf , 350 cash.
 

If you buy a hdb ,priced ard $500k, with cov 40k,
 

Assuming, you use cpf/cash to purchase your flat.

Cash left : 350 - 80 - 40 - 25k = 205k left.

CPF left for other pty investment - none... as you need to meet min sum for your 2nd home. 
 

205k is only enuff to put downpayment+ stamp fee for  500k 2nd pty. So you need to be clear that if you chose to buy a hdb.. you cant really buy a pty if your saving remains the same.

That's why I curious why in the first place they sell their flat for? Did they listen to some agent thinking that prices will drop that why they rent a place to stay? Imagine gonna spend money on stamp duty and renovation, It is just not worth it.

People slog their whole lives and saved 600K Cash and you guys dissed his combined income of 7K, it's not how much you earn but how much you can save sometimes.




How true for some posts.  At least, TS appears to be someone prudent and being without kids, they have their advantage.  Having said that, there had been ppl who sold their homes, strike million $$$ windfall and ended up in more sorry state than they had been.

To TS, I can only wish the couple my best wishes to capitalise on their financial position to last their lifetime.

Some JB house is about RM 1 mil, can retire already? Eat grass?  



 

Why buy the house in cash full?  Rental a house and pay rental.......put RM1.4M in bank to earn an interest of 1.5% per year....you will get $21K income every year...

btw i did not think ill of the couple... what i said was they will hv their ways to generate other streams of income...



bro AFV, hope this clarifies  




Generating income is one thing.  Having the discipline to save or put it to good use is another.  How many who have the opportunity to build their wealth have the discipline?

Look at those who talk about changing cars the minute they thought their car loan is a 'break even' or has created a 'windfall'?  It says a lot about such young Singaporeans today.  No wonder $$$ always no enough.

Do you know how to read? TS said he has 600K cash and 200K CPF, that's 800K. I think he should whack a private condo at 1million, 10 years later it will become 2 million




ha haha .. see wrongly.. okay.. asssume 600k cash + 200k cpf

hmmm let me do a simple calculation for you..
 

If you buy a hdb ,priced ard $500k, with cov 40k,
 

Assuming, you use cpf/cash to purchase your flat.

Cash left : 600 - 80 - 40 - 25k = 455k left.

CPF left for other pty investment - none... as you need to meet min sum for your 2nd home. 
 

455K now is only enuff to put downpayment+ stamp fee for 1.5 mil 2nd pty in 5 yrs time . 

Given that i believe the prices will moderate in the next few yrs. *raising interest rate in 2014 , supply surplus in early 2013*. 

It may be good that you buy hdb now, pay the mthly installment using what is left of your cpf. 

And keep the cash 455k in some fixed income which yield ard >3%.  ( est 560k in 5 yrs, excluding further saving from your 7k income)  
 

If you buy a condo now which is 1~ 1.2mil now, you can hardly buy a second pty. Also if you condo will incurr more cost etc maintances fee , higher mthly installment which may eat into your cash. Not forgetting that in 2014 , there may be interest hike, that will probably eat up  some your saving now.

Past is not equal to future. What if a 1 mil condo become 500K 10 yrs later?

How true for some posts.  At least, TS appears to be someone prudent and being without kids, they have their advantage.  Having said that, there had been ppl who sold their homes, strike million $$$ windfall and ended up in more sorry state than they had been.

To TS, I can only wish the couple my best wishes to capitalise on their financial position to last their lifetime.




if no kids can consider 3 rm resale....

I'll rather ppl who sees the truth and tells it early rather than to hide it.. not say it , pretend to say it nice and/or sabo later...

But strangely...most of these ppl already have HEARD the truth...

Good analysis but markets are unpredictable and hard to find yields of 3% in low risk investments

If you buy a condo now which is 1~ 1.2mil now, you can hardly buy a second pty. Also if you condo will incurr more cost etc maintances fee , higher mthly installment which may eat into your cash. Not forgetting that in 2014 , there may be interest hike, that will probably eat up  some your saving now.
