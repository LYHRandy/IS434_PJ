i very highly doubt it will be allowed. then even less incentives for couples to get married and have kids. And real families have even less chance of getting a flat. too many negatives, no positives. Even with current rules, no shortage of flats being taken up. Why change?

Allowed singles to buy BTO? Dont think it will ever happen in s'pore. As the housing policy in s'pore is encouraging family life and encouraging people to get married and settle down wtih kids, so singles can buy BTO is the greatest joke of the year!

Even 30 years lease is still better than buying a resale flat. Cause resale flat is way too expensive!

i think maybe they might relax the regulation, 

(bring down to 30?)
 

but now MND pump up BTO supply, 

a bit stupid to jack up demand by including singles in BTO right?

If age is a consideration, they have to bring the age qualification upward and not downward. Simple rationale is to let singles accumulate more funds before purchase and also give singles more time to consider about marriages. Isnt it true?

if you bring it later, then they hit income ceiling also.
 

the current rules sucks because they allow young couples to buy at time when their income is lower.  but as they age and climb the corporate ladder then they also went past the income ceiling. so to simultaneously set an income ceiling and a higher age qualication to buy is essentially still discriminating the singles from subsidized hdb flat.

Yes thats true. But not all will hit income ceiling as we look at the economics sentiment. Being singles are at the disadvantage, and I am one of them. There again, being forced to stay in a marriage which has already broken down is even worst. Many couples are hanging on to their HDB and their broken marriages are truths untold.

precisely, if you did follow my post, i am not a fan of the current hdb policies, mainly because it discriminates against singles and divorcees and also because it is ineffective / deviate away from its objective of providing affordable housing for masses.
 

in fact earlier this week, i was using the same arguments you have now to discuss with j22.

Bro, chill chill. Popple that benefit from favourable policies will be blinded to injustice on the opposite camp. Its human nature. Based on published report, the divorce rate was 35.1% 2 years ago. Meaning to say, there are lots of separated individuals in the category that dont have a proper roof of their own over their head. I am sure the gahment knows about this.
 

Meanwhile, life goes on. If they dont change the policies, we just need to be more money minded like them and make much more money to solve our "housing problems". I am planning to semi retire in JB actually. Buying an HDB unit here is also in my plan, just in case i want to settle down inmarriage here again, and also to make good use of the ransom CPF monies in the OA account.
 

I am fine with the system about single buying only from resale market, but i am absolutely sick about the Valuation System. The VS simply helps to ;push the pricing of resale higher and higher based on the way the formula works.

Although no policy can make everyone happy. But at least should be "fair" to everyone lo, and everyone at least is given a choice and chance to buy BTO.

To them, their choice at the ballot box is not a statement of their agreement (or disagreement) with the government's heading and/or policies.

I understand where u r coming from. Hence, I am still ok about singles buying resale only. With that, i would say that the valuation system to be scrapped for true open market buy-sell. The current formula is bias. If valuation system is a must, it should be more intricately refined, otherwise, it will propel valuation price to incline.

Well, its not as if condos are more economical rite? Even there are some one-bedroom private being launched close to 400k, however, the banks are very reluctant to loan to singles with only 20% downpayment I have heard. I believe it was also aired in the forum here.

Look at it this way.....if property prices stay high, who benefit? The banks and govt right? Because of loan interest, tax and excuse to sell high priced bto and be the gd guys by giving you rebates, subsidies, grants. They are also the ones who can regulate the valuation process to make it more transparent. 
 

Valuation is based loosely on last transacted price, amenities being built or are to be built, location, height of flats and age of flats. But seldom will valuation be lower than prev transacted units. Its always higher. So until seller sells below valuation, its hard for prices to come down ESP for hdb because they are discouraged to sell below valuation. 
 

We have to explain why the flat are selling below valuation. If they dont accept the explaination, the sale might burst.

Whether the rumour is materialising or not, i think its worth to hang on for a while. 8000 more HDB units launching tmrw, cooling down on the private segment is definitely taking some effects. As for the HDB resale segment, it looks like the folks that are thinking of selling their current units are still hoping to have High Cash In, they need more shaking to let it go at lower COV.

Is he trying to prove he is more capable than last time?



 

no choice,who asked horse face tan slowly and delay releasing of BTOs to bubble up the price everywhere from pigeons holes to private holes property.if not market very dull you know.must put in some spice and chilli to heat things up.
 

so now kbw have to come in and release and release,just like pcc everyday to release the heatness in him..surely price have to drop abit what but cannot drop too much also(else got alot of ppl will drop from the skies),if not how public can see he got do some wayang?

Highly unlikely will/can happen, if single can buy BTO, Gahmen sure kenna left/right and upside blue/black,
 

Tis type of policy can nvr change, They are thinking of grey population. with chronic problems, medical and housing for the senior citizen, after 62yrs
 

I can attest that I'm not pappies runner not any RC kapo, this are imoprtant issues facing us one day, so they have to act fast to solve the grey prooblemm.

maybe in 2016. when there is an oversupply of ready flats.. then maybe they will open to single to buy directly from hdb.
 

The last time when there is a oversupply, they also change the rules from cannot rent out , to can rent out. The levy amt , open to 2nd timer etc.. So i think it will happen.. but only when the ready supply is over immediate demand.

I understand where u r coming from. Hence, I am still ok about singles buying resale only. With that, i would say that the valuation system to be scrapped for true open market buy-sell. The current formula is bias. If valuation system is a must, it should be more intricately refined, otherwise, it will propel valuation price to incline.



 
 

U are not wrong to say the least, your point has value, but for hdb val to be scrapped was biased, how on earth does one equate to fair trade pricing, even landed/non-landed pty goes by actual valuation determined by professional valuer.
 

In summary, i read that you are saying, Quote and unquote: " Propel Valuation price to incline ", 
 

It does not need to be this way, Sp pty is governed by strong fundamentals, solid infrastructure and consistent economy years round, if Sp HDB prices will to fall, then Gahmen head will fall too.

I cannot agree on this.

Always work out your loan quantum first before searching for properties...at least u know what the amt to work with. They will check ur credit rating , if there's any other outstanding loans, length you been at ur current company, job sector to determine your loan amt or approval.



 

U real estate agent huh!
