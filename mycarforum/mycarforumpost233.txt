To me, most of them are very poor ads. I'm not fooled by those that can be for any condo, like those that show a frog, a nice sofa, smiling people, flowing water. I mean come on, 30secs ad and nothing about the unique features of your condo? That tells me it is just another condo. Those that give me some info, like how far from MRT/expressway, near which school, near what amenities, those I think serve their purpose. Those abstract ones, forget it. Its precisely those ads that you have to be beware of.

Most of them can't draw a map to the proper scale. How can you trust developers who cannot even produce an accurate locality map to build your house?

those who rely on these map, may think from tuas to airport one one step or 5mins drive.....   developers are not known to be 'transparent' in such things, usually abit blur/artistic in drawing maps...

Maybe some developers are just lazy to think of something more creative and just use it since it's the in thing now. Just like now if you see a development with the name "something something Mansion", you will know roughly which era it belongs to.   [laugh]   So 20 years down the road, you hear "something something residences", you know it's built in 201x.

nowadays developers splash easily $3-4m to build a showflat and then later demolish it.
 

If the condo has say 300 units, each buyer will have to fork out $4m divide by 300, anout $13,300 in his purchase price for the showflat!!  (developer priced the cost of showflat in selling price of each unit)

Some condo ads have women supposedly the wife/mother wearing bikinis walking around the condo.

I find such ads a big turn off that they need to resort to such gimmick to sell. 
 

Anyway, condo living is very expensive. Was checking out an 8 year old LH and another 3 year old LH in D10, with total units between 55 and 90 units.

Was shocked to learn the monthly maintenance fees are $500 for the former and $620 for the latter. Both are 3 bedders.
 

I was thinking the older projects should have lower maintenance fees after collecting the sinking funds over the years. But they upped the maint fees recently due to higher salaries for the security guards and cleaners.

Hey,

Beware of the 'Actual Showflat' that you are visiting, there are lots of unrealistic dress-up to make the place look good and feel good eg,

-mattress placed over bay windows to make the bedroom look spacious

-thinner drywalls dividing the rooms, thereby craeting 2-3inchs more in each confined space, which is alot!

-bedrooms doors are not installed

-some walls are not built

-some walls are replaced with full height glass dividers

-lots of full length mirrors to visually enhance space

-undersized furniture or cupboards

-timber deck built over recessed planter boxes which is illegal if you try doing it in your actual unit

-sliding doors between Living room and balcony (if any) not installed

-oversized Aircon to make you feel very cold and comfortable

-big appliances that they dont provide will not be shown ie.washing machine, fridge..

-create a livable space within the bomb shelter (if any)
 

many more..
