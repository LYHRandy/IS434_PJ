My friend was house hunting in Bishan and showed me pics of this awesome looking 4-rm HDB in Bishan, asking for $100k nett Cash Over Valuation (COV).
 

How much are you willing to pay for this? FYI...all high end fittings, TV, furnitures etc included.

nice, but I would also ask what's the valuation in the first place..the person doing the valuation might already have factored in the reno?

As far as I know, HDB valuation is based on amenities and location of the flat. So it shd be the same valuation as a normal flat in the same block bah.

I saw on the web it is $585k neg., my friend told me the owner will not settle for anything less than $100k COV, so it is $560k.

The reno is nice and I think the owner paid more than 100K. I ever come acrossed a so-called designer deco, ask more than 100K. really damn nice. Imagine asking for 100k cash (COV), where to get man, loan??

Strange..how come 4-room HDB only 2 bedrooms?? But 1080 sqfeet is quite big for a 4-room HDB
 

100K a bit high. The reno I think is around 50K. The furnitures plus TVs at most 15K unless they are all super high end type.
 

But valuation price should have factor in the reno already. Otherwise what's the point of valuation right?

for me, it depends on location as in which part of bishan? nxt to junction 8? or at catholic high ? and which floor?
 

but 100 grand is too steep personally... assumingly location is superb plus high floor... i reackon if seller ask COV 50-60 grand people will snap it up in no time... if 100grand... must wait ..long....long... 
 

this is discounting carrot heads

Apparently, the owner paid $200k (Hear say) but I was told from AC to all fittings branded wor. Probably those people with excess money and already staying in condo and want to maximise govt benefit will buy lor. May be weekend getaway with mistress.

Need to view the real thing to evaluate but personally will not pay anything more than $50k cos renovation is subjective. Some i see like to build partition here and there, end up impractical as not much storage space. 

Also these days a lot of reno stuff nice to see only as underying material is all chipboard with lamination only.

Hence not difficult to create the "condo" feel.

I used to hunt around for houses last time before i got mine now. i too came across 1 particular house in sembawang with *hotel* looking designs.
 

owner wanted only 10k bargained she came down to 5k but i still didn't buy. But that wasn't as chic as the one posted here.
 

Personally 100k is too much eventhough its really put up luxuriously. PPL can still get it around 50k or less once the owner realised his asking is ridiculous.

Hey, that bed looks like a single bed positioned lengthwise! There is so much space infornt of the bed and the Tv wall. Or course the fish eye camera shot also cause it to look weird.
 

Its nice, when its new without a single extra items in the house.

When you add in the magazine, newpsaper, knick-knacks, crockery, etc...It will not be that nice and spacious anymore.

Renovation is very subjective. If you are going to pay 100K COV for someone else renovation. I suggest to use the money to do up the place according to your own style. 
 

Pay COV for a good location + high floor. 
 

if 100K better be very very high floor + unique 1 of the kind

come to think of it, these days, even houses with ordinary fittings and renovation work can command cov of over $30k or more, so this excellent piece of work for $100k, come to think of it, is relatively fair.

these are CAD pics. 

wait till you see the real thing, defects and cracks are given.

workmanship also may be questionable etc...
 

anyway, those acquainted with design will know that such looks are very very common and getting really passe.  
 

Valuation price should factor renovations so COV is simply a function of who is gian.  seller gian to sell or buyer gian to buy.

Bishan because of all the famous schools there. My friend moving because of his kids, within 1km of Catholic High.
 

Another friend paid $30k COV for 3 room in Marine Parade so that his kid can get a chance to get into Tao Nan. By the way, not for stay because he has a Condo.

buy a branded sofa and resell ... price drops even lower

same for TV , fridge etc ...

mmm... I spend like 40k on my reno 5 years back. 
 

I sold my place (EC) recently for around 50k more than the average prices transacted. I think there are people who are willing to pay for reno. These people are those who wants a nice place QUICKLY, no time for reno but want a nice place. not everyone has 4 months to wait. 
 

Actually, depending on what fittings and furnishings the place have, reno can be very expensive.
 

One Toilet can easily cost 15k or more....

If you ask me, I would tell the owner straight;
 

1) Your unit is mid floor

2) There's no privacy especially the living room

3) There's no view to talk about here

4) The reno is nice but I don't like it especially the flooring

5) I never believe in paying and accommodating for 2nd hand reno, would do it myself and my way
 

Think I would just walk away, interior can change anytime, but you can't change the location of you unit, as well as height and facing etc. These are the real factors that makes the flat valuable. Good luck in your sales.

I think 60-70K COV is a reasonable sum to pay for this flat in current ppty climate...nowadays in decent locations like this, a normal flat with no reno does alr fetch 30-40K COV...with the quality reno being thrown in, I reckon its fair to pay additional 30-40K on top of the usual 30-40K COV which most would pay for in a decent location like this..so I feel its reasonable to pay 60-70K COV for this flat..

If I really like it.... Have to check how much they paid for it. See receipt to believe. Then discount it depending on how old the place is. Maybe drop 30-50%. This will be the cash over what's the norm for COV for similar normal units. HDB valuation does not really factor much for id. Negotiate from there. Has to be win win for both, so the buyer must appreciate the design for the sales to proceed.
 

If don't like the design, then forget about buying the place. Seriously the seller won't sell for nothing, not unless he is financially in need. And you won't pay premium for the id work, and then tear them down.

Stayed in Telok Blangah area for around 20 years from mid 70s to mid 90s. Location is not bad. Not too crowded and easy and mainly fast access to orchard/raffles place by bus where I used to work. But the neighbourhood is getting very old now with flats around 30 years at least. Old neighbourhoods have their own set of problems if you are not used to it.

for those who are concerned about good schools in the area you live... I would like to find out actually how curcial is this factor?
 

Well... the purpose is to get your kid into the good school... and living near the school, gives what? only phase 2c priority? And it's only for one time use, right? after that, any other siblings will get high priority as first sibling already in the school. 
 

Unless travelling distance is a major issue (since most here are driving, and transport funding should not be a major concern as most willing to pay high COV anyway - I would think ease of travelling is important but not the most critical issue).
 

So.. if so... if just for that one time phase 2c priority - would it make sense to rent a place near the school that you want for the period of time required before entering school, and then move back to own home once the kid gets in? That way can save the major COV for the home near the good school, and use the money for better purposes... like buying an additional car!

Is time limit also on how long must rent, and then must also have place available, and I think rental must be approved by HDB (unless rent private condo)? Then there is also issue of travel time? 
 

My personal view is that between "branded school" and "competent" school is not such a massive difference, so would reccomend just to choose good school near to where you live. 
 

I am lucky and have about 4 schools all within 2km of my place that would be happy to send kid to...although will probably send her to Mee Toh, which is right downstairs from my block - it has a very good reputation and much competition.  Apparently here students go straight to higher chinese...so also better

I am lucky and have about 4 schools all within 2km of my place that would be happy to send kid to...although will probably send her to Mee Toh, which is right downstairs from my block - it has a very good reputation and much competition.  Apparently here students go straight to higher chinese...so also better



 

My own experience:

My first kid, whilst intelligent, is by no means the hardest working kid in her class ... and I did not want to be the kiasu parent that many in Singapore are, by forcing her to do tuition until the cows come home. She only had tuition for Chinese as she was struggling without help.
 

So I let her generally have fun and do all the extra activities she wanted to do. She was in a neighbourhood primary school .... though it was a top school in annual results, I did not force her to study everyday. She got good grades at PSLE (but not in the high 270s to 290s that the geniuses from China are getting now), qualified for some good secondary schools, but not the cream like RGS, etc. 
 

But I advised her... she could go to a famous secondary school, and be a small fish in a big sea, because everybody there will be kiasu and fighting crazily for grades... or she could choose a relatively good neighbourhood secondary school, be the big fish in the small pond.  She now goes to a neighbourhood sec school, walking distance from home. It is by no means the top school, though it has produced several top students during every O levels. But she is at the top of her class every year, gotten MOE awards for doing well, gaining confidence in herself with her success, having fun in CCAs she likes, and facing little pressure from the parents. I'm sure she'll do well in her O levels and get to a good JC or Poly; but'll she'll probably not be the top student in Singapore. But she's enjoying school every minute of the way.
 

That's why I feel that parents who die, die will pay tens of thousands for high COVs to be near "branded" schools may be paying unneccessary money.

nice, but I would also ask what's the valuation in the first place..the person doing the valuation might already have factored in the reno?



 

yeah.. i believe that the valuation would have factor in the cost of the reno as well... 
 

$100k cov... its totally nuts.. 
 

i can buy a $300k 4 room flat in amk and used $100k for a makeover maybe even better than this.. n i still save $100k plus... 
 

seriously at $500k and above.... for a hdb flat? no way even if it is in bishan. 
 

i rather pay a bit more for a condo and stay 5 mintues away from orchard, which is what i did 2 years ago.

From the poll it really shows that renovation is a personal taste kinda thing.
 

It can be AWESOME for the owner but GARISH for others.

For me, i treat my daughter as average and prepare your well in advance. Since first day K1 she is already with enrichment classes in chinese and english. With Tien Hsia & Mind Stretcher. And this year started primary 1, she has additional maths HOME tution with a existing pri school teacher one to one at home. On top of that her mom go through her homework or coach her in english and chinese everyday.*(Maths wise, we dun touch it, cos our method is totally diff from the maths now, its better a fulltime current primary school teacher assist her) 8-9.30pm on weekdays & 2hrs in the afternoon for sat & sun.....since mid last year. WITHOUT FAIL. Our thinking is that, if she needs the assistance, it will help her progressively. If not, it will enhance her ability further and improve even more. We do not believe in last minute giving tution to play catch-up and rush it through whether she can take it or not. We do monitor very very closely over her progress and her behavior during that 2 years. With adjustments along the way. We are glad she has become a very cheerfull and obedient kid. And well ahead of her peers in school now.
 

She has limited TV viewing on weekdays and outings is reserve for sat & sun afternoons, immediately after her mom are done with her coaching. Any where she wants to go........she just have to point. I'll bring her. Swimming, beach, parks, downtown east. computer games, DS games, Cartoon CDs etc etc, she name it, she will definately have it. But come Monday, its strictly Study mode again. We want to instill a sense of responsibe routine into her, with a strong message, Study time is 100% study time, like wise playtime is strictly playtime. So much so that now, she will automatically standby at her room for studytime and also ask for the sky during playtime.........haha.
 

School wise, we are very fortunate that im a ex-pupil of a good neighbourhood school in toa payoh. Even more fortunate that by moving to TPY from Sembawang, both wify and mine workplace is just 15mins drive away.  We save on petrol, travelling time and even avoid ERP. School is just 3 mins walk from house block to school gate. Hence save on schoolbus fees and our gal is fresh for school too. Very minimum travelling for both our kid to school and for us to our workplace. To top that, my sister's house is just next block with kids already in the same primary school. Paying 200k more for all this is worth every single cent of it. 
 

Back to topic, any house is not worth 100k COV. Reno is good to the sellers taste, but never to the buyer. It doesnt make any sense to pay so much for the reno(maybe 30k at most), it should be been consider in the valuation costs in the first place.
 

Especially when i got mine top 25th floor 120sqm unit unblock city view for $12,888 COV only. Fully renovated(2years ago) and 100% move-in condition. haha.
 
 




My own experience:

My first kid, whilst intelligent, is by no means the hardest working kid in her class ... and I did not want to be the kiasu parent that many in Singapore are, by forcing her to do tuition until the cows come home. She only had tuition for Chinese as she was struggling without help.

last time our parents got always give us tuition etc?
 

i think parent nowadays muz not too tough on their kids..
 

think this way..our era we learn our era thing,this era,new generation learn different thing..so there's no nid for them to learn different things
 

our childhood games etc will not b able to play by the next generation ,so i feel if i have a kid,make sure he got a happy childhood.
 

like i said,a person potiential is not known by what he has from young..but overall when he has grown up
 

i rather let my kid to open up themselves than to make them study everyday..miserable one leh
 

IMHO

We have to change and adjust according to the current climate. And not compare old times and hope it still fit the bill.
 

Unfortunately it just dont fit. Not by a long shot.
 

Not when there are so much more distraction now since our old days......like internet, computer games, good public transport system etc etc. Too many to mention.
 

Not when it is so competitive in the job areana now....especially from the FTs. 
 

Not when everything cost so much more expensive now as compare.
 

Its just not the same anymore. 
 

Whether a child have a good childhood despite of all these pressure and still survive. It all depends on the parents planning.....more than ever before. In short, the parents must not be the bo chap, lazy kind and yet dont over stress the kid. Easiler said then done! 
 

Maybe thats why child birth is very low now.........ppl just cant bring themselve to plan ahead and make that sacrifice. Too easily defeat in thier mind........IMHO.

i think distraction is same depend which era we in..same logic apply to last time we study feel difficult doesnt mean this era kids feel difficult coz it's what they learn in sch,just like us on what we learn last time
 

eg my era ,got micro genius,nintendo etc
 

go play catching till v late,go big longkang play etc
 

job competitions are always there..just that about the pay
 

FT are cheaper,some are ex
 

but is Singaporean willing to accept? this is a question we should ask ourself sometimes, not always saying FT steal our job but some situation,maybe yes. 
 

Things are more and more exp..But alot people just wish to fulfil their lavish lifestyle,cant blame who also..improper planning...
 

I used to tot why i cant retire at 65..after properly calculation,planning and seeing the situation ,i change my opinions..like i say,end of the day,choice laid in our hand..
 

Just curious, any parent in past handle us like how we handle your kids now?
 

If different, what u see in urself handle by your parent?
 

If there's difference,what impact is on u now ?
 

Just curious
 

Btw just happen to past by a neighbourhood school call South View Pr..wow,they have top 5 PSLE students from there, internally top 10 from them is 270-286
 

not bad for a not v famous neighbourhood school

Wow... completely opposite my kid's lifestyle...  
 

Well, to each his own, I guess. I hope your kid grows up well, and look back on the childhood with happy memories.   
 

Lucky you to have paid only $12K plus COV for a good house. I'm so far on my 1st direct HDB flat, don't look to sell for a long time, cos it's in a good place.
 

Most people who have the cash to pay high COV, would usually be able to afford to renovate again according to their own taste. So.. in the end... money just flows like water for these folks!

WOW! 
 

During my primary school days, I just went to school, came back, ride my bike round neighborhood, played with neighborhood kids, watched tV from 5pm to 9pm and went to bed at 10, repeating the whole process during weekdays.  In the end, I managed to top my class just about every year and scored top 10% results for PSLE good enough to enter any sec school i wanted.
 

Guess my parents had a good time.

Good that we do see each other views with open mind instead of the usual bashing. 
 

U know what, i have your exact thinking not too long ago.......until recent years that is. Maybe you will get a better picture when your own fresh and blood is in the equation. 
 

Everybody has its own expectations and tolarence. To each his own i guess. No right or wrong. 
 

Every child behaves differently. Your method might not work on mine likewise mine wont work on others. 
 

At the end of the day, every parent will want the best for thier kid and within thier means.
 

Cheers bro.

Actually ... back to topic ... wouldn't it be more sensible to find a cheaper house... and spend the COV on additional car (assuming the asking COV is like $50-$80K) if distance is the factor, or if already enough cars, for other expenses, like solid renovation?
 

After all.. other than the flat size and amenities... the actual location is relative to the mode of transport, I would think.

its a dilemma our parents faced that i only now understand. 
 

personally, i think the most important lessons cannot be learnt in school. 
 

all i ask of my kids is humility, honesty, trustworthiness and compassion. 
 

im not sure if my school years taught me any of that. sure i learnt the tools to make a good living, but surely a living without any of those isnt really a life. 
 

anyway, no right or wrong, to each his own. Cheers.

hehehe.........my childhood was a chaotic one as well. Even go friend school see xxx video at primary 6!
 

Disappear to Ubi for few days during secondary school term with friends! Penty more hair-rasing stunts. haha.
 

Most memorable childhood ever. Unfortunately, my brain not gensis, so never did well in my studies. Have to struggle like siao to get into a good company with decent pay now. (Hopefully can still get 6 mths bonus like previous years.    hehe)
 

My wife also went through life the difficult way too. Normal stream to express to poly then to Uni. Survive 10 years at DSO. Now the pioneer HOD with a promising newly set-up department of MHA. Was even short-list for Deputy Secretary post in MHA recently. But she decline it and choose family time instead(for the next 5-7 years at least).
 

At the end of the day, we (or you for that matter) have made it in life through sheer hard work, doesnt mean everybody will be as fortunate as us. It would have easily gone harewire. Thats why me & wify plan for our gal this way.
 

Its not some unrealisatic plan pluck from thin air, but one that we have think long and discuss a lot about.

wah..ur kid should be a strategist next time...maybe he is good at planning
 

for me,housing to sleep can liaoz,location dont so ulu
 

i grown up in my area since liquid form  ,i v familiar wif surrounding and people,even if shift i also shift around.
 

problem is it's 30 years old area but recently going to have upgrading.amenities etc all have,go town take bus 30mins can teach,not bad for a west side area
 

i thinking this,bought over at 230k (valuation) from ah ma coz i stayed with her..after cpf etc shld loan 70-80k.easily finish 5-10 years (must plan how i want)
 

the cash she had,will split with me, average i should have 100-150k in hand. by 35 my loan should finish..same as my insurance shield plan,so there's another figure standing by by then..
 

so this is my simple lifestyle bo chup early retirement plan

Ya agree.
 

House is always about location, floor level and area. Reno counts for nothing. 
 

I would not consider this unit even for 50k COV.

HDB valuation based on location, amenities, high floor etc. Reno doesn't count much.
 

COV basically translate into bidding war whereby it depends on how much you willing to pay for convenience, privacy & comfort. For example, near shopping, mrt & bus services, corner unit & high floor etc.
 

If everyone in the family is driving, COV for near MRT, Bus Interchange etc is pointless. Next is the move-in condition, if you can move-in without reno, that can translate into savings. Hence, COV. Then again, you may & may not like the design.

Most memorable childhood ever. Unfortunately, my brain not gensis, so never did well in my studies. Have to struggle like siao to get into a good company with decent pay now. (Hopefully can still get 6 mths bonus like previous years.    hehe)



My wife also went through life the difficult way too. Normal stream to express to poly then to Uni. Survive 10 years at DSO. Now the pioneer HOD with a promising newly set-up department of MHA. Was even short-list for Deputy Secretary post in MHA recently. But she decline it and choose family time instead(for the next 5-7 years at least).
 

At the end of the day, we (or you for that matter) have made it in life through sheer hard work, doesnt mean everybody will be as fortunate as us. It would have easily gone harewire. Thats why me & wify plan for our gal this way.
 

Its not some unrealisatic plan pluck from thin air, but one that we have think long and discuss a lot about.




you sound like in the same company as me haha. i am also waiting for bonus declaration and dont know can still get 6 months or not haha.

My friend was house hunting in Bishan and showed me pics of this awesome looking 4-rm HDB in Bishan, asking for $100k nett Cash Over Valuation (COV).
 

How much are you willing to pay for this? FYI...all high end fittings, TV, furnitures etc included.

Yup, they shouldn't have done up the house so luxuriously then not live in it for long. I really doubt anybody would wanna pay a cov of such amount these times.
 

Or maybe he just wanted cheap publicity.

I tink the owner of this unit was interviewed in TODAY's paper. According to them they rejected 95k, as they want 100k no less. If not they carry on staying.
 

Good luck to them...

Renovation is very subjective. If you are going to pay 100K COV for someone else renovation. I suggest to use the money to do up the place according to your own style. 
 

Pay COV for a good location + high floor. 
 

if 100K better be very very high floor + unique 1 of the kind




Totally Agree.

If I need to buy a 4rm flat in Bishan, I buy high floor, no renovation unit and do up like Hotel also no need $100k... and best... its my design liking...

I think they are crazy..where got pple sell house or sell car do so on non-negotiable basis one? if 100k is asking price, then be prepared to accept 90-95K cash..they will regret it...another couple of yrs down the road, their flat might depreciate by 100k..I don't believe the boom will remain for long...

If I had the money and I really like the location I would pay
 

$100,000 if
 

1. COV is $50,000 for no reno flats in Bishan, quite possible as my

    friend paid $36,000 COV for pasir ris.
 

2. The reno and furniture cost $200,000 and bought less than 1 year ago.
 

I like the colour of the reno and can move in without the inconvience of doing 

the reno. 
 

Also I have seen many reno in local magazine and very few look this nice.

IDs nowadays achieve a nice look for flats using cheap materials like homogenous tiles and laminate flooring. But those materials dont last, espeically laminate flooring for rooms (got bubbles pop out after a while). Homogenous tiles hard to maintain also, everytime kenna dirt in between.
 

This flat, the flooring is clearly marble (italian, Serpeggiante), and the rooms are using real parquet. Same as high-end condos. The flooring itself will cost 25-30k for a reasonable-size flat. so i estimate the reno alone to be around 65k. The furnishings + electrical appliances another 20k. Total of 85k.
 

Being real marble and parquet, the next owner only have to grind and polish it, and the flloor will literally be good as new.
 

Then again, 100k COV is just too much. That's enough cash (10%) for downpayment on a 1 million dollar condo. Which would come with quality flooring, kitchen fittings and wadrobe, all brand NEW.
 

I would pay at most 60k for COV here. 40k for the location and 20k for the reno. If the couple doesnt want to negotiate, then just too bad. I can take my money to get a flat near holland V. I look of my window, all private, also shiok. At the end of the day, Bishan is still a heartland town.

I think should be typo. Valuation of HDB 5rm flat there would be around 600-620k at most. Would in their right mind would ask for a COV of close to 400k for a hdb flat??
