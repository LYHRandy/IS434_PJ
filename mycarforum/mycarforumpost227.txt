Bro...that one is different.
 

First of all, it is the rarity of the Van Gogh painting that gives that value. There are many art collector in the world, but there is only one such Van Ggoh painting.  So if you want it, you have to pay millions.

this one is again different 

has 20,000sq feet
 

but in the end of it all

i agree with you completely that it is an amount of money that seems not inline with the general property in Singapore
 

but then again

when some heartland with 99year can sell for 1800per sq feet

why not sentosa

where there is exclusiveness, rub shoulders with the very well to do

if a pRC pay 108million for this property 

many will say, siao trying to show off

dont know where to throw their money

or worse - sucker
 

but if warren buffet buys it for 108million 

many would say basket, this warren fellow know a thing or two more than we know

must go out quickly to buy a similar property

surely he must have analysed the market left right centre back and front

like many people think it is crazy and who would buy 1800per sq feet for bishan

but a few people did
 

wont be surprise if someone buy this bungalow

The last done for similar property is 2-3k psf...

Now this guy selling at 9K+ psf, 3 to 4 times above market rate.
 

I could be wrong, but looks weird to me. 

This is most likely not money laundering, as the money appears to be in the system already. 
 

There's seldom a good way to transfer 50m-100m cash without raising eyebrows and red flags, esp if its for services rendered, where no receipt can be issued. 

This is one of them.

every morning, wake-up, you see the sea. every evening you see xmm on beach, every night, you see monkey like children playing on the beach (chwee quee aka water devils) and when CNA news Flash about earthquake in Indon, you see Tsuinami...
