Q1) If I stay in a subsidised HDB flat, am I able to purchase a resale flat?  That means I will own 2 finally.
 

Q2) If I stay in a private property, can I purchase a resale flat?



 

Q1) Don't think so, as u need to form a family nucleus etc. (you and wifey, children or parents etc.), unless u transfer the name of your current flat over to another person (subject to HDB approval and T&C attached), but then again, u still need to form a family nucleus for the 2nd resale flat. 
 

Q2) Yes u can purchase a resale flat if u stay private property, but u will not be eligible for HDB loan and the minimum occupation period (MOP) has been raised to 3 yrs. Previously bank loans, ppl can stay for 1 yr before selling.
 

Hope it helps.

1. No, you can't owned 2 flats. But yes, you can still buy, however, you have to sell your flat or relinquish your share (if you are a joint-owner) within 6 months from the date you take possession of the resale flat. (On condition the MOP is fulfilled)
 

2. Flat owners and occupiers are allowed to invest in private properties (both local and overseas). However, they must meet certain eligibility conditions before they do so.
 

Flats Bought Directly from HDB/ Open Market with CPF Housing Grant
 

The eligibility conditions are as follows:
 

          a. The flat owners must satisfy the required occupation period for their flats before acquiring private property

                i. If fulfilled, they do not need to seek HDB's prior written consent before acquiring private properties
 

          b. The flat owners must continue to stay in their HDB flats after acquiring private properties

                i. However, exception is made for those who have obtained prior approval from HDB to sublet their flats under the 
 

Subletting of Flat policy
 

Flats Bought from the Open Market without CPF Housing Grant
 

There is no need to satisfy the required occupation period for the flat before acquiring private property. However, flat owners must continue to stay in their HDB flats after acquiring the private properties.
 

Exception is made for those who have obtained prior approval from HDB to sublet their flats under the Subletting of Flat policy.

If this has not been answered yet:
 

You're getting first hand information:
 

1

No, you cannot own two flats at any one time. Doesn't matter if it's a new build/resale/etc etc. Never, ever.
 

You can, however, own 1 flat + infinite private property. Limit is your wallet.
 

2

Yes. You can purchase resale if you own a private. But no subsidy whatsoever.

Hi, anyone can advise on the t&cs of taking gov grant when u buy a new flat (BTO) ?
 

if take grant, what is the catch in the future ? Pay back when u sell ?

When you applied Bto, you are already getting a subsidized flat, therefore you are not eligible for grants. Grants are for those who are getting resale flats. Hope I've answered your queries.
 
 
 

The CPF Housing Grant is a housing subsidy to assist married Singapore citizens who are buying a resale flat from the open market for the first time. The grant can be used for the initial down payment to reduce the housing loan quantum.

no grant for BTO. flat already subsidize.
 

another catch is this. if you are not getting from governement another subsidized flat again. no penalty if yes. you have to pay back base on what size flat you gotten.

I'm staying in a private condo now. If I buy a resale flat now, must I stay in HDB resale flat and change my residential address to HDB flat or I can still stay in my private condo and maintain my present residential address and leave my HDB flat vacant?

If you are a private property owner, you can own a resale flat as long as you occupy it. Which means you can't leave it vacant.

Yap. Under special conditions, you may do that. Just need to inform HDB. 

(But I know alot of people don't do that, they sublet illegally instead).

Okay, Yes, your average gross monthly household income for the one-year period is not be more than $5,000.
 

Extract from HDB
 

The Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) Scheme, introduced in March 2006, is meant to help citizen families with a steady household income to buy their first subsidised HDB flat. The AHG can be used for the purchase of new, resale and DBSS flats. It is an additional subsidy over and above the regular market subsidy and CPF Housing Grant that new and resale flat buyers enjoy respectively. The scheme was enhanced in August 2007, with the income ceiling and the grant amount raised - to help more households own their first flat.
 

On 6 February 2009, the AHG Scheme was further enhanced, to make owning an HDB home easier for more citizen households - especially the lower-income families.
 

The enhancements are as follows:

The answer is YES

with interest if i'm not mistaken
 

alot of people dont know about returning the grant so when they buy from open market and get the grant. In a few years time the sell to move to a new flat.....guess what, from the profit you made from selling your house, the grant will be return 1st
 

so want to buy, can but dont take the grant if your downpayment is within your cpf

Try looking at the market rates in those property websites...
 

Or get a property agent to find for u, but he will take 1 or 2 months of the rent as commission.
 

U also need to inform hdb abt ur intention to rent out.

if you loan for 1 year. com is 1/2 month only nia... but the good thing is, evertime you got problem. just call the agent to settle. if he value you as a customer, he will settle for you. if not then black list this agent.

Not if you live out your MOP. But if you get another subsidised flat, you will need to pay a levy.
