Whats your feel? With private property/HDB prices going up, up and away, do you think now is the right time to sell? Or is there more leeway for price surge? 
 

For discussion

No harm putting up for sale if you have property.

Almost definitely sell. But depends on how much you can make, of course. If you're having a place that's still developing, I'd say to rent out and wait.

Hmm, think for my case can only make 10% after factoring in all the comms, stamp duties, bank penalties. The place is in Balestier and just next to the developing Zhong Shan Park.

Holding 1 private as investment. But very low end property. Good thing is that I bought it way back in...2004 or 2005. Totally before the entire boom. So now it's nearly 100% profit, without taking into account rental. Another lucky thing is, after buying for ~3 years, gahbernment announced plan to build MRT right next to it (downtown line, bukit panjang). So, price went up. And developer bought over a mall there, going to tear it down and bring up another condo. Got other empty land parcels, so I think got potential for more develop. So I'll be holding it for another few years at least.
 

Anyway, because I got it for so cheap, the rental returns is pretty damned good (ratio), so no point selling.
 

Dream of getting enbloced. But don't think that will happen, haha.

Honestly, no. Simply not sustainable. How are young people going to get a place of their own to stay? I'm lucky enough that my parents are financially smart and responsible, and that I grew up to be like them, pretty frugal, and all my investments so far has been timed -JUST- right, out of pure, dumb luck.
 

Aaaaaanyway. It will, at most, sustain at current level. Don't see another boom within the near future, especially considering still got a lot of units in pipeline.
 

Hope that it bursts, I'll take the chance to grab another. Felt very sad when I missed the chance last year/2008 because I felt for sure that it's going to drop some more.
 

Aiya....

Yah man I bought mine in mid 08 when prices had softened alittle. Shld have bought it early last year during the crisis when prices came down a fair bit. Then can make some gd $$$...  :angry: 
 

Only my HDB is timed nicely... bought in 2004 and sitting on 100% profit.

Oh, yeah. Balestier district? Should be quite pricey. Especially near height.
 

My HDB bough about a year after my condo. But because in ulu location (for my own use only), I think 25% increase. Is okay lar. I'm happy with the place because I like quietness.
 

Now HDB all about.....$300K. Resale even more ridiculous, with people asking for 50K+ COV. Considering that newly weds should be making, like 6k-ish, just not very...realistic.

Am in the market to get myself an aprtment for investment.
 

I think many owners are trying to sell at this moment with so many feel-good factors in the media (double digit GDP, etc). But there is a huge gulf in the asking price and the offering price. In my example, I submited an offer of 720k for a unit in D16 valued at 730k last month. The owner rejected the offer and am now listing the unit for 780k. 
 

My conclusion is that supply has already surpassed demand and the owners must rely on their holding power if they insist on selling at their target price. Meanwhile, if you are selling a unit in D16 in the range of 750k, drop me an PM for a discussion.

Yah lor.  For a typical 5 rm hdb in central district.. can costs around $600k and above easily. $600k can get one good condo in good location in the past.

HDB?
 

Pretty much impossible to get HDB at below valuation price right now. 50k COV is the norm. I think I've even heard of 100k COV in Jurong East area, right beside boon lay mrt.
 

Crazy.

No, either those boutique apartment or condo. Have been priced out of freehold project so will have to be satisfied with leasehold.
 

I tested the market by putting my current HDB for sale, someone actually offered 45k COV. Not selling anytime soon.

Bought my place during SARS and just sold it. About 60% profit.

Just bought another one for own stay. 

The market is flooded with unprecedented levels of transactions. Supply over demand? Yet to see. Another crash? The world is too cautious to let it happen again. But it shld take a breather, I feel.

my personal take is probably to sell now if the price is reasonable, not so far down the road we will probably see the GE coming( i have a feeling after that more "efficient" policies will be implemented to further "cool" down the market), also general interest rate could rise. .that time have to depend on your holding power leow.

Govt may logically try and reduce the HDB pricing to make homes more affordable to the general voting public. I heard that one of the possible measures include making landed properties readily available to PRs.
 

Lastly bubble in 96, according to the seasoned folks, caused by affluent HK pple who snapped up local properties before the handover, despite the high interest rate environment, and it "was crazier than now". Hence factoring in the 14 year gap, inflation and present sentiment/interest rates, i'd say we have a full year (or two) to go before the bubble (if any) will burst.
 

We're still lagging in terms of landed property prices VS 1996. We are also in a low interest rate environment - in fact SIBOR and SOR have both fallen, housing loans at 1.1% onwards.
 

Despite seemingly draconian measures (to me) from the Chinese Govt (70% financing 1st prop, 50% financing 2nd prop and no financing for 3rd prop), i was told by Singaporeans who actually work there:

- the top 10% are the ones really snapping up properties

- these very affluent may own anywhere from 3 to 10 properties

- bank financing is not crucial for this echelon
 

The mega-rich go overseas and buy properties based on 0% to 50% financing. At 50% financing, any bank in SG will lend you any amount of money, cos the security more than covers the outstanding loan.
 

My personal take is that the bubble will truly form and peak when:

- effective home loan interest rates soar (probably 3% at least)

- China decouples (marked fall in China real estate valuations) and dragging down the world
 

I personally also think that in the land-scarce Singapore, property valuations are relatively low and set to appreciate in the long term. So any correction in the absence of the above two may prove to be a minor blip for more cash rich locals/foreigners to enter the market and sustain the valuations.
 

Lastly, let's not under-estimate the effect of the high rollers. It may not be common knowledge, but junket operators have not hit SG, as MBS had not opened until 2 days back. Junkets bring with them the high rollers. In Macau, these guys contributed to up to a 400% increase in property prices from 2002 to 2007, when Stanley Ho lost the monopoly of the gaming industry.
 

Our gambling tax is 60-70% of that of Macau's, and our property valuations by far lower. We do not have capital gains tax. If i were high roller or junket, certainly hard to miss SG. I believe that this may prove to be a major boost in local private property valuations. Net effect of MBS + RWS is that private property prices go mad.

Hey bro, so what's your take on S'porean Singles getting a resale HDB?

I know many, whom are very unhappy because they can't buy new, hence have to get resale.

Now with the high "COV" being asked, i foresee it's more worthwhile to get a Pte Property?

Of course the above is applicable to singles who can't buy new flats..

Just to clarify a few points since I stumbled across this posting :
 

1) Statistics and historical trending are for understanding and not for determination. This is very misleading and common mistake for most. Events during all material times must be taken into account.
 

2) Disparity between real income increase vs property price appreciation has widened. In 1995, fresh grad gets $1700 per month, in 2009 $2300 per month. In 1995, Ardmore Park and Four Seasons commanded $1600 psf. In 2009, you do not see anything lower than $2900 psf. Figure out the percentile on real income. Absolute value wise its horrific  
 

3) Land may be scarce? : that's where you are mistaken and that's what "they" want you to think. Singapore has a high rate of urban renewal comparable to Hong Kong. Old buildings either torn down quickly to build new ones or alteration done to enhance plot density and change of use for more built-in area. I have come across a barely 5 year old condo development sold en-bloc to make way for a newer condo (quite shocking to me actually  ) 
 

4) High rollers will not come. Government effectively killed it with the Junket Regulatory Act. Two killers : No credit to be extended by casino and all VIPs' particulars are to be submitted to authorities before arrival even if stay is within 12 hours. Most of these guests would want anonymity when gaming and travel incognito because of money trail and personal identity. Such guests also rely heavily on credit terms extended by junkets and casino back to back as payments mostly are done via discreet means.  
 

5) Government wants casinos to cultivate mass market patronage and avoid hot money migration and possible laundering activities. They are not experienced enough to know this will not work.
 

If you do have a property and has since appreciated, try to sell and realize gains within this year. 1% nominal interest increase has a multiplier effect on your effective mortgage terms and if you stagnate on yearly earnings, your discretionary and disposable income goes south. Sounds morbid.... just to feed a perception (greed).
 

I pity those who bought last 3 quarters. High mortgage. A repeat of 1998-1999 property owners who still barely break-even despite current prices. Truly negative equity region... I have personally come across portfolios of 312 properties in such conditions 
 

Don't believe the hype reported in newspapers    Tread carefully, defaults will be coming in by 2nd quarter 2011.

Wah. Hmmm. A cursory glance shows that studio apartments are ~450k at least. Only the pretty well off singles can think about getting one of these, so I'll guess that you're one of those. 
 

Quite a few more things to consider in this case.

I assume that this is for personal use.

I also assume that you're 35 already, so can choose to buy HDB right now if you want to.
 

Private price fluctuations always much greater than HDB. Assuming that this is the peak, I'll still advice on getting an HDB first. Because when the market starts going down, you'll make much less paper loss and you'll still have some cash lying around. Who knows, maybe it's enough for you to get a studio then. Then you'll have a private + HDB, can choose which to stay in and rent out. Always a nice setup like this. 
 

Unless you want to be able to use the facilities. But if you're single, I'll say toughen it out, the market will come down eventually.
 

By the way, I'm not familiar with the HDB regulations for singles buying. I know you have to get resale, but do you get any subsidy?  If yes, bigger reason to get HDB first.

so the current logic would be to wait ? 
 

from the point of view of one who is still renting, have the capability to buy THAT landed property but think it's really too expensive to waste the money on it, i am in 2 minds whether to continuing waiting or plonk down the cash for that CT/SD and to hell with it ...

Buy any FREEHOLD property for long term gain.
 

Guys, don't worry about the market. It will not crash if the economy stays positive, crash is too strong a word. Consolidation is possible in the distant future but it's too far to think for now and in no time it will be the next property boom.
 

What sibor? You think the gov is stupid? The gov is smarter than most of us here and I'm not propagating for them. The key is, interested rates and property market (land supplies) are both controlled by them and they will balance up both factors to prevent a crash from happening. The gov got you covered.
 

The real money makers take advantage of corrections but even if you don't, can't or don't know how, holding on to your property in SG is a sure win way to make money (just a matter of more or less). That's why property is considered as an asset in SG but in other countries like US where hurricane can blow the heck of your wooden hut, it's not so.
 

Why do you think the foreigners are interested in snapping up properties in SG? Rich people are smart and smart people don't do things for nothing. If you think buying property in SG is just like buying stocks, then you are better off investing in stocks.
 

In some way, I agree with jilrx (singapore condo forum) that property will always go up in tandem with the economy after factoring in the inflation rate. However, I don't believe in not selling since it's the only way to take advantage of consolidations.
 

With that all said, watch for the next property boom instead of praying that the market would not crash. It's just a matter of time that SG property market will break through the ceilings and soar above the skies.
 

NOTE: I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT CHINA OR US OR EUROPE, THESE PLACES DON'T APPLY

I have some investment properties and I am very happy with the crazy price movements and wish that they would go higher . But my gut feel is that prices have gone overboard. If they continue rising till end of the year, the govt will definitely come in with additional measures that will bring it down to its knees. 1-2% interest rate increases is not going to dampen demand much and neither will there be noticeable defaults. But govt actions which will gradually have more bite will do the trick.
 

Long term outlook for properties is very good but short term it might be a bit too late to get in now. Then again prices may not fall much - maybe 10-15% max . Timing a purchase is going to be very tricky. Easy to get played out as seen in the last bear market where most were expecting prices to fall further but instead it made an aggressive recovery overnight catching most offguard. So property investments should be for long term. Look at the long term trend and not try to make extra from short term trends where you will likely find yourself stuck with no property or end up chasing and paying more than what you sold for.

11k!?
 

Definitely go for the HDB first. The minute you purchase a private, you can kiss your subsidy goodbye. The only time you want to do this is when there's a very clear uptrend and you only have money for either HDB or private but not both. 11k, when you're purchasing something 200-450k is quite sizeable.

Hmm, think for my case can only make 10% after factoring in all the comms, stamp duties, bank penalties. The place is in Balestier and just next to the developing Zhong Shan Park.



 

zhong shan park =  tiong sua park   
 

if i were you, i would sell. but buy back right away in another area.
 

balestier is an area where the downside, in the event of a property slump, is higher in terms of % than other parts of the central region.
 

why not try some older developments, as in 5 to 10 years old, in novena or newton?  i believe they should fit your budget. newton euro asia, gloucester mansion, thomson euro asia, birmingham mansion, etc  even those older ones in river valley can also consider: euro asia, kim yam heights, etc  Can even try river place, 99 years, well maintained and quite popular all along, mainly because of the strong expat rental market there.  for very good locations, 99 years leasehold is not a big concern.
 

granted they may not look as nice as those glitzy new condos coming up everywhere, but as you know, buildings grow old and depreciate. location does not and nothing can take location away from you.  and there is always the option of renovating the old apartment into something you really like.

bro, u seem really confident of the local pty mkt. how high can it really go? Why not sell some on the way up?
 

BTW, can anyone tell me which is a better option when it comes to selling? thru multiple agents or exclusive agent? Thanks.



 

across the board (averaging the entire island), it is nearing the previous peak in 2008
 

however there are still some good deals and what i think are undervalued gems out there that for some reason aren't played up as much.  resale condo prices are still lagging behind the brand new launches by developers.
 

for some reason, many people don't feel good when paying another person for their house as it implies giving that person a bloody property windfall.  those people feel better when they pay above the odds to the developer.

Buy any FREEHOLD property for long term gain.
 

Guys, don't worry about the market. It will not crash if the economy stays positive, crash is too strong a word. Consolidation is possible in the distant future but it's too far to think for now and in no time it will be the next property boom.
 

What sibor? You think the gov is stupid? The gov is smarter than most of us here and I'm not propagating for them. The key is, interested rates and property market (land supplies) are both controlled by them and they will balance up both factors to prevent a crash from happening. The gov got you covered.
 

The real money makers take advantage of corrections but even if you don't, can't or don't know how, holding on to your property in SG is a sure win way to make money (just a matter of more or less). That's why property is considered as an asset in SG but in other countries like US where hurricane can blow the heck of your wooden hut, it's not so.
 

Why do you think the foreigners are interested in snapping up properties in SG? Rich people are smart and smart people don't do things for nothing. If you think buying property in SG is just like buying stocks, then you are better off investing in stocks.
 

In some way, I agree with jilrx (singapore condo forum) that property will always go up in tandem with the economy after factoring in the inflation rate. However, I don't believe in not selling since it's the only way to take advantage of consolidations.
 

With that all said, watch for the next property boom instead of praying that the market would not crash. It's just a matter of time that SG property market will break through the ceilings and soar above the skies.
 

NOTE: I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT CHINA OR US OR EUROPE, THESE PLACES DON'T APPLY



 

jlrx of the condosingapore forum... to practise that guy's religion, you have to have very very very deep pockets and financial sustainability.  not for everyone lah.

It's all about liquidity.
 

As long as you dont take profit, it's just valuation.

valuation up or valuation down.  you only feel good at best but you cant use the money until you liquidate.
 

sure there's the $10k - $15k rental income, some may argue.

but with that kind of money in question, $10k - $15k per month in realised profits is not totally that difficult from the markets.

many of the folks here can attest to that.
 

My take is simple.  everyone has their own opinion about every market.  

the key is to act on it.  if your opinion is to buy, then buy.  if your opinion is to sell , then sell. if you opinion is to stand-by then just stand by. 
 

Whether right or wrong ultimately is not the point, it's all part of life.
 

At the end of the day, there should be nothing to regret becos you know that you made your own right decision at the point in time.

Thats what makes each and everyone, his own man.

Just to clarify a few points since I stumbled across this posting :
 

1) Statistics and historical trending are for understanding and not for determination. This is very misleading and common mistake for most. Events during all material times must be taken into account.
 

2) Disparity between real income increase vs property price appreciation has widened. In 1995, fresh grad gets $1700 per month, in 2009 $2300 per month. In 1995, Ardmore Park and Four Seasons commanded $1600 psf. In 2009, you do not see anything lower than $2900 psf. Figure out the percentile on real income. Absolute value wise its horrific  
 

3) Land may be scarce? : that's where you are mistaken and that's what "they" want you to think. Singapore has a high rate of urban renewal comparable to Hong Kong. Old buildings either torn down quickly to build new ones or alteration done to enhance plot density and change of use for more built-in area. I have come across a barely 5 year old condo development sold en-bloc to make way for a newer condo (quite shocking to me actually  ) 
 

4) High rollers will not come. Government effectively killed it with the Junket Regulatory Act. Two killers : No credit to be extended by casino and all VIPs' particulars are to be submitted to authorities before arrival even if stay is within 12 hours. Most of these guests would want anonymity when gaming and travel incognito because of money trail and personal identity. Such guests also rely heavily on credit terms extended by junkets and casino back to back as payments mostly are done via discreet means.  
 

5) Government wants casinos to cultivate mass market patronage and avoid hot money migration and possible laundering activities. They are not experienced enough to know this will not work.
 

If you do have a property and has since appreciated, try to sell and realize gains within this year. 1% nominal interest increase has a multiplier effect on your effective mortgage terms and if you stagnate on yearly earnings, your discretionary and disposable income goes south. Sounds morbid.... just to feed a perception (greed).
 

I pity those who bought last 3 quarters. High mortgage. A repeat of 1998-1999 property owners who still barely break-even despite current prices. Truly negative equity region... I have personally come across portfolios of 312 properties in such conditions 
 

Don't believe the hype reported in newspapers    Tread carefully, defaults will be coming in by 2nd quarter 2011.



 

Haha... Thanks for the advice... I still got 4 properties, 2 in D9, 1 ard RWS, 1 for stay. Disagree on pts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5...
 

Cheers...
 

Let me clarify:
 

1. Interest rates are still very low. Hard to peak in a low interest rate environment. Bubble peaks when interest rates rises and volume thins - basic technicals. My call - mid 2011 earliest. During which equities and properties will peak - easily 15% upside.
 

2. Fresh grads don't buy Four Seasons or Ardmore Park. The disparity only shows how "devalued" a tertiary education has become locally - simply because many more universities and many more graduates.
 

3. Land is scarce.
 

4. High rollers who prop up property prices don't need credit. You can ask any mortgage banker who serve the Chinese clients specifically. Registering details - no issues. How they got the money - big issue. However, nobody asks the latter. Which is why the mega-affluent come in to buy property, max max based on 50% financing (why not since rental yield is enough to cover the low interest rates for now?)
 

5. Govt may have their visions and strategies, but it's a consumer's market at the end of the day LOL...
 

But at the end of the day, the interest rates are still very low, and volumes are buoyant still. We haven't peaked yet.

it all depends on how those fellas finance their properties.  

high mortgage that tantamounts to biting off more than one can chew is clearly dangerous

Similar to cars, one can choose to buy 3 on loan or buy 1 with full cash.

no prizes for guessing which one is on most solid ground.
 

but ultimately , every single thing we do in life is a tradeoff.

just make sure that the tradeoff situation you face is is truly what you prefer

agreed.
 

I can sell for 500k profit and some smart alec will tell me I should have sold it some other time for 600k profit. 
 

As though anyone can ever time the market with such precision.
 

Make your choice, live with it. All others pay lip service as it's not THEIR money. You can listen to a little here and there, but it's your money so you decide what to do with it.

there is no logic in that statement. another frog in the well comment. this time, the frog thinks that the only property bulls right now are agents.

Go with multiple agents. In fact advertise in the classifieds and clearly indicate "Owner, agts welcome". Prior to this find out the market price and stick to it. Disadvantage of multiple agts is some fo them will try to hoodwink you to accept a lower price to close a deal but this approach should get you to sell the place faster. 

Disadvantage of advertising yourself is get ready to answer phone calls from agents for a long time to come. Advantage is it helps you keep tabs on the overall health of the market and gives you first hand knowledge of where market is heading. Private ads are stored in a database and contacts sold to agts. When you get bothered by more agts it means market is on the upswing. I am gettting almost 4-5 SMSs of property launches daily and 2-3 phone calls on whether I want to rent/sell my condo as compared to one in 2-3 days when the market was down in 2008. All from just a few ads placed in last 2 years for renting out my properties. I don't need to look at newspapaer headlines. Just by monitoring the no of phonecalls/SMS from agts I can predict what the next headline is going to be.

the  "property market agentmeter" - how property is heating up based on number of agent calls! lol yeah asking multiple agents better than signing so-called exclusive with one agent. the latter means that he knows money in his pocket so he no rush no hunger. but of course depends on what seller prefers.

You can see it in anoyher light too.
 
 

Exclusive deal have a time line to run, they have to complete the deal in a time line if not exclusive deal is off. 
 

plus if your deal is not exclusive, they might not be in a hurry to market it, after all, they might be wasting their own money to market a house that is not exclusively theirs too. unless they happen to have a house in the same region that they are marketing.
 

another disadvantage of getting multiple agent.

you got 3 agent. you tell them your selling price is 800K.
 

Advertise fee by them

1) 820K

2) 800K

3) 780K.
 

if you are the buyer who will you call? meaning, you will likely be getting a lesser price.

Nowdays most experienced agents sell units through their contacts and seldom rely on agressive marketing, etc. This is more for the newbies.

You have to stick with one price. Tell the agt nothing below $xxx so that their asking price will be higher than your $xxx & this $xxx indicated price could be slightly higher than market price even if you could reduce it finally for serious buyer . 

Biggest advantage is that many buyers get agents to source units for them especially foreigners & seldom rely on classifieds. If the agent knows he will get the whole commission for himself and need not co-broke, then he will try his best  to psycho the buyer to get your particular unit without the buyer knowing that the agt is pushing for that unit because he will get a higher commission. 

I recently rented out my unit to a Japanese who had already signed the LOI but not the official  agreement for another unit. There was some disagreement over the wordings in the contract which could have easily been thrashed out but when his agent saw my ad , he persuaded the Japanese to give up that unit saying that the other contract has major problem which was not really the case, got him to view my unit and got the agreement signed within 24 hrs - just because she need not split the commission.

all you need is one rogue agent to do that to disrupt your plan totally liao.
 

Anyway as for experienced agents, they will likely had gone for higher yield area if your area need to rely on 3~4 agent to market your house.
 

Also for your japanese tenant, you are talking about rent here which is 2 different ball game.

Typically, if you dont close a rent deal in less than 2 weeks, your client will disappear, this is unlike buying a property as what the person buying is totally unique. for ppl getting a rented house, they are not that particular about a lot of stuff.

I would appreciate if you could read my statement in the context it is written and not resort to name calling.  I just don't believe prices will move in one direction all the time.  Only people with vested interest will tell you otherwise.  If you think that property prices will continue to move up and up despite economic cycles, you are entitled to your own "bull" opinion.  I doubt you seriously believe in that.  I am entiled to my own opinion, so are you, just chill and be nice.

Rogue agents aplenty , especially with this flooding market.
 

I also lost a deal even though I offered $30k more than the final transacted.

why ? becos agent wanted to keep comm all to herself. 
 

Cannot trust agents to get you the best price.

Yes best price for themselves, more likely.

So if got a bit of time, just sell your property yourself.

learn a thing or two at the same time

I offered through my agent which means seller agent mustaccepting my offer means she will have to co-broke and share comms

Oh well, it could be the other way, becos my agent was selling another one and didnt want me to buy the other one.

I heard of this case from my agent friend before. 

This Agent bring a buyer. But the seller agent keep making things difficult for the buying agent, scold him lah, threaten him lah and many other things. Then later when buyer offer high price, the agent tell the buyer:" i took to the neighbour the other day, that house haunted."

Ah, I've heard of such cases from my own agent as well.
 

He went in there, going to make a good offer, but the seller agent actually physically restrained him from meeting the buyer because the seller agent managed to get a buyer of his own (therefore no co-broking) that's offering a lower price.

look like i quite forturnate. 2 of the agent friend of mine are good agent, they will rather take a lower com by co-broke and give the owner higher price rather than taking a higher com and give the owner low price.

I have been advertising in papers for many years and opening my commission to all agents. Best man wins and takes the standard comm. Yes there are agents who will try to be funny. But no one got the better of me as my homework is all done before I put up the ad. Most of the time the property is rented out before the average period required. Some agents who call a few days later are surprised that the property can be rented out so fast. All because of my strategy of letting the maximum no of agents fight it out for the comm. IT ALWAYS WORKS. 
 

You must be one of those agents who go around propagating exclusive deals.

I see, you mean self advertising. This is different. Initially i though you get 3 agent to advertise and sell your house. 

but then Rental and selling is still 2 different story lah.

Whats your feel? With private property/HDB prices going up, up and away, do you think now is the right time to sell? Or is there more leeway for price surge? 
 

For discussion  



 

I posed this question earlier this year. Compaing prices then and now, prices have easily gone up another 10 to 15%. It just amazes me that mass market condos 3 bedder units are now all selling at easily $1.2m onwards. Even 2 bedders are hitting $1m. Will this ever stop? Who is snapping up all the units and pushing prices higher? Can't be average couple/family on the streets right?
 

Say $1.2m, after 20% down at $960K, monthly loan instalment based on 1.5% interest is $3K onwards. Once interest increases to 4%, monthly would be like $4K onwards. What is the profile of these buyers? Richie rich from other countries?
 

Would there be another round of cooling measures to deliver the local idiots from doom?

Just to illustrate:
 

The Parc - 3 bedder (1216sqf) = $1.28m ($1050 psf)

Kovan Residences 3 bedder (1259sqf) = $1.26m ($1000 psf)
 

Of course, cheaper condos are still available in ulu areas like woodlands and CCK. That said, I heard that the new condos pending launch in woodlands and lakeside are going to cost $1000psf onwards.

as long as interest rates are low n rental mkt steady, sellers can still hang on.

Its very simple.
 

It just depends on whether you can buy with cash or need to take a loan.
 

If you are buying with 100% cash then you really dun need advice from a forum

and with cash, anytime is a good time to buy.
 

The only people that need advice are those taking a loan. If you need a loan

then yes its a good time to buy if the banks are willing to give you a loan.
 

In a recession when prices are low, it will be very hard to get a loan unless

you have a fantastic credit rating. If you have a fantastic credit rating,

you dun need a loan.

Fantastic rating can be in the form of wealth or stable job tio bo? So best is to wait for interest to up, prices to correct and have stable job/wealth to pick up the pieces.

if you do not need the $$$ urgently, keep it. afterall, with the ultra low interst rate + high rental yield... its one of the best investment at the moment... 
 

if you were to see it now, where to put your money?? fixed deposit with less than 1% interest? gold price that is alrd sky high? or share market filled with full of hot monies from US?

they are you average HDB owners. LOOK AROUND you. Many people has fully paid up HDB bought cheap whih is worth 500k. + 100k savings, they only need 600k loan which is affordable.
 

A lot of people seems to think that people buy 1.2million property as first property which is weird. Cannot see all the HDB upgraders meh?

YES.  there are many people who will leverage to the hilt.

these people i consider half past six.

If I do the same as them, I will be living in $10mil detached and driving supercars.
 

$200k to $300k most standard household with parents who have retired will easily have.

dont underestimate the standard Singaporean retiree.

rich chinese, indians and indonesians are using singapore high end property as wealth preservation and possible money laundering vehicles, among other asset classes.  foolish singkies charge into mass market low end thinking that they can multiply their meagre capital.  that is the difference.  FYI, most of these foreign high net worth who buy high end properties don't even live there or rent out.

Young foreigners flocking to S'pore 

Better job opportunities and quality of life are the main attractions

By Melissa Kok 
 

Pilates instructor Morven Macleod, from Scotland, came to Singapore about three years ago. She has worked and lived in New Zealand, Australia, Spain and Canada, and says the quality of life is better here. She plans to apply for permanent residence. -- ST PHOTO: LAU FOOK KONG
 

FROM countries as far away as Argentina and Peru, more young and educated foreigners are heading to Singapore to live and work.
 

These foreigners - in their 20s and 30s - are moving here for better job opportunities and because Singapore is seen as a great anchor point for work and travel in South-east Asia.
 

Pilates instructor Morven Macleod, 36, from Scotland, came to Singapore about three years ago after years of working and living in places like New Zealand, Australia, Spain and Canada.
 

'I love my job here and realised that my quality of life is better here,' said Ms Macleod, who has a degree in business studies and languages from the University of Edinburgh.
 

'I'm able to walk about and not feel threatened or have a fear of my home being broken into. People here are genuinely quite nice, too.' 
 

The single woman currently holds an employment pass and hopes to apply for permanent residence.
 

She joins a growing number of expatriates who are considering staying beyond their usual two-year employment contract and possibly taking up PR.
 

The trend of young, educated foreigners moving here is borne out in findings from a poll conducted by research firm Gallup, which found that Singapore is one of the top migration destinations among the young and educated, if everyone who wanted to leave their home country did so.
 

The survey, which covered 350,000 adults in 148 countries, showed Singapore to be the only economy in developed Asia - which includes Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan - that would not suffer a brain drain if people around the world could migrate anywhere they want.
 

In fact, Singapore would have four times its current number of educated adults, with at least a bachelor's degree. Even greater would be the jump in the number of those aged between 15 and 29: It would rise six times.
 

Migration specialists and business owners catering to the expatriate market have noticed more young, single and educated professionals making the move to Singapore in the past year.
 

The number of foreigners and PRs here has nearly doubled in the past 10 years, from 1.04 million in 2000 to 1.85 million this year.
 

The influx of foreigners in recent years has been a hot topic among Singaporeans, whose concerns revolve around problems in understanding these newcomers and a fear of tougher competition in the job market. 
 

There are no official figures that provide a breakdown of foreigners here by age and nationality. But at the end of last year, there were 856,000 work permit holders and 82,000 S-Pass holders. A further 115,000 held employment passes, which means they are better skilled and earn a monthly salary of $2,500 or more.
 

Global mobility expert Kenneth Kwek, who is senior vice-president and general manager of Cartus Asia Pacific, noted that the number of young, single professionals posted here for work has grown. 
 

A survey of 196 human resource practitioners based around the world conducted by Cartus last year showed that expatriates in the under-30 age group had increased to 29 per cent, from 19 per cent in 2007. 
 

Single expatriates posted overseas for work grew from 29 per cent to 42 per cent during the same period. 
 

In the Asia-Pacific region, young and single expatriates now make up 20 per cent of Cartus' clientele, growing by 34 per cent in the past year, said Mr Kwek.
 

Ms Evon Estrop, director of operations at Orientations Singapore, which provides relocation services, said that of the expatriate families and individuals her company has helped relocate here, about 60 per cent are younger professionals aged below 40 who hold at least a degree.
 

They are usually singles, couples without children or with just one child, and often working in middle to senior management positions in sectors such as banking, consumer products and IT, she said.
 

In the case of her company, most expatriates who fall into this group are ethnic Asians, such as Indian nationals who could have studied, worked or migrated to places like Britain or the United States before relocating to Singapore, as well as Germans, Australians, Americans and Britons.
 

A big draw factor for them is the strong economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region, compared to European countries and the US, which are still recovering from the economic crisis. It means more job opportunities for expatriates here, she added.
 

More are also taking on local terms instead of premium expatriate packages. In a survey of 200 companies conducted by HR consultancy ECA International last year, 21 per cent of its expatriate employees here were on local terms. The percentage is up from 15 per cent in 2008. 
 

In another recent survey conducted by HR consultancy ORC Worldwide, two-thirds of 36 multinational companies here also offer 'local plus' packages - local pay but with some perks such as partial housing or education allowances. 
 

For some expatriates like American Virginia Brumby, 32, their stay here has even led them to set up their own businesses catering to the expatriate community.
 

Ms Brumby, who came here to pursue her MBA at Insead 2-1/2 years ago, said she and her French husband set up a lifestyle company - Survival Chic - in October last year. It helps clients with invitations to arts and social events and special deals at restaurants and bars. 
 

'Entrepreneurship is encouraged here and things work in a clear and straight-forward manner. It's also a very international city, and the lifestyle sector is growing fast,' said Ms Brumby, who is on an employment pass but is thinking of applying for PR in future. 
 

More global companies also tend to prefer posting a young, single professional here over an older and more senior executive with family, for cost reasons. A company could save tens of thousands of dollars per worker if it does not have to foot school fees and spousal aid.
 

Ms Danielle Bray, 28, an American who runs an insurance agency called Expat Insurance, said that based on her own observations, 'it used to be 70 per cent families, 30 per cent single expats, now, especially after the financial crisis, it's about 50-50'.
 

Expatriates said they enjoy living in Singapore because of efficiency in doing business, a safe environment and lifestyle. Some added that food and transport are also affordable.
 

For some who come from big cities like London, housing here is also comparatively cheap, even in upmarket areas like Bukit Timah. 
 

Some like it here so much they decided to take up PR. Among them is Belgian Daniel Quadt, 35, who was posted here five years ago to manage a company project by his former employer.
 

He applied for PR about three years ago and eventually started a business running a travel website. 'There are lots of things happening here, from architecture to politics. It's much faster than Europe. I like that Singapore is a place that is constantly moving forward,' he said.
 

National University of Singapore sociologist Paulin Straughan said the growing young, single expatriate community in Singapore 'has a lot of potential'.
 

'If they happen to find a significant other here and settle down, this can contribute to a growing, stable Singapore population,' she said.
 

While she said their presence will also add to the ethnic vibrance and cultural diversity of Singapore, she cautioned: 'We need to watch the inflow of this group carefully. As long as there are sufficient jobs, it is all right. We need to make sure we do not overcrowd the economic space.
 

'We need to be fair to young Singa-poreans trying to launch their careers and start a family.'

generally means the vertical row of the building, not the floor.
 

so every floor of the same stack will have basically the same view/facing , only higher or lower angle.

alot of high end props are foreign owner occupied or used as 2nd holiday homes here. most of them r rich enough to not need to divest even if market turns down.
 

did u try buying a D9,10 condo early last year? I can tell there were v little fire sales in the open. If u were in the mkt, u will know how hard it was to buy any condo at fire sale price last year.

bro,  the rich divest because they have better fish to fry elsewhere, and not because they are desperate to sell due to the falling value of asset.  if they find better opportunities elsewhere, they can also throw at couple of million losses without batting an eyelid just to unlock their other few million value in the property.
 

no i didn't buy D9,10 last year. i bought in the early half of the decade. other than the one i sold in 2007, the other 2 of them i sold early this year.  i am still living in the last remaining one.
 

last year i only bought D1 and it was a good price. still holding at a healthy paper profit.
 

rgding fire sales in D9,10,11 last year, i remember there were: aspen heights, UE square, valley park, shanghai one, all those old ones inside jervois rd, sixth ave residences, park infinia, and i believe ardmore 2 if i am not wrong.  it was a great singapore sale for those cash richies.

bro,  the rich divest because they have better fish to fry elsewhere, and not because they are desperate to sell due to the falling value of asset.  if they find better opportunities elsewhere, they can also throw at couple of million losses without batting an eyelid just to unlock their other few million value in the property.
 

no i didn't buy D9,10 last year. i bought in the early half of the decade. other than the one i sold in 2007, the other 2 of them i sold early this year.  i am still living in the last remaining one.
 

last year i only bought D1 and it was a good price. still holding at a healthy paper profit.
 

rgding fire sales in D9,10,11 last year, i remember there were: aspen heights, UE square, valley park, shanghai one, all those old ones inside jervois rd, sixth ave residences, park infinia, and i believe ardmore 2 if i am not wrong.  it was a great singapore sale for those cash richies.



 

of all u mentioned above, only ardmore 2 is considered high end... & i tell it was dam hard to buy it a good price... the only window was jan-mar 2009. after that everything shot up. i cldnt close a few deals in places such as cosmopolitan & balmoral area coz owners refused to sell at fire sale price. look at the caveats lodged... 1Q09 so little transactions because it was really hard to find a bargain.

Noone interested in properties anymore?  



 

i still am but not at these prices....
 

i'd be the so called man in the street looking for a bigger place.

kids need more rooms, i need more SPACE.
 

only options are those big jumbo flats, or pte or landed properties.
 

so i flip through the ads and see condos asking for >1mil, and they're wayyy smaller than what i'm staying in.
 

its really a downgrade then. 
 

i just can't get my head round the singapore pty market....

Sorry, but what does stack 7 or stack ??? means? 

The floor level?



 

Its the vertical column that the unit is in. eg #10-07

The floor level is 10th, the stack is 07

Ok thanks for the explanation. 

Ya, the " stack " will be important as it will affect the view of the unit also.

Just curious, The Orchard Residences is priced between $3-4k psf. Some units are over $10M.

Who actually can afford the condo?

If rental yield is 4%, the annual rental is $400k?Can buy a 4rm HDB every year. 

Property tax of 4% = $16k?

Bankers, Lawyer, CEO, Chinaman?

thursday special report

Young foreigners flocking to S'pore 

Better job opportunities and quality of life are the main attractions

By Melissa Kok 
 

Pilates instructor Morven Macleod, from Scotland, came to Singapore about three years ago. She has worked and lived in New Zealand, Australia, Spain and Canada, and says the quality of life is better here. She plans to apply for permanent residence. -- ST PHOTO: LAU FOOK KONG
 

FROM countries as far away as Argentina and Peru, more young and educated foreigners are heading to Singapore to live and work.
 

These foreigners - in their 20s and 30s - are moving here for better job opportunities and because Singapore is seen as a great anchor point for work and travel in South-east Asia.



 

yeah lots of incoming talents. 

but these new 'expats' are not going to rent 4k/mth condos.

have a quick look around the expat forums.

you'll see threads asking 'is 5k/mth salary enough to survive in sg?', something which was never seen before.
 

yup that's the going rate for these new ones.so how many are renting the high ends?

bro, if you look back at your post, you asked whether D9/10 got any fire sales or not last year.  you did not ask D9/10 AND HIGH END as well.
 

anyway for your information, cosmopolitan in RV and most condos in balmoral with the exception of sui generis and the new launches, are not high end as well. so....  li kong simi?

These are the steps to selling your own private property without the help of an agent:
 
1) List your property in all online platforms and the classified ads of ST;
 
2) When a buyer comes along and a price has been negotiated, fill in the OTP, sign it and give it to the buyer. A step by step guide to filling in the option to purchase can be found in https://www.directhome.com.sg/fill_otp . Remember to collect 1% from the buyer;
 
3) Within 14 days, the buyer must sign on the acceptance portion of the OTP and submit it to the law firm acting for you. On acceptance, the balance of 4% is handed to the law firm who will collect on your behalf;
 
4) After the OTP has been exercised, completion should take typically 8-10weeks, but of course both parties are free to specify a later completion based on individual circumstances. 
 
Selling a private property is generally quite straightforward. It is not as time-consuming as you think and everyone can definitely do it on their own.

People sell their properties and move house for many reasons,  if can save on that 1% or 2% of the pty price,  why not? For people who are not urgent to sell, I recommend the DIY method.  For urgent sales,  maybe the agent's arsenal would be more handy in finding a buyer fast.

Just to add, for property worth up to $2 million,  the law firm charges around $2500 for seller  (same for buyer).
 
The OTP is a very simple document but some people may not even want to touch that. It is basically the seller giving the buyer an offer to buy his house. If the seller is too lazy to DIY the OTP, just fix an appointment with a law firm and go down to the law firm with the buyer to do the OTP. The firm charges few hundred bucks to do the OTP for you.

   OTP is NOT a simple document, it is a LEGALLY BINDING between two parties, any misunderstanding with certain clause stipulated inside both parties are liable to be sued, especially if the property sold is sell with tenancy, a separate inventory list must be attached and inform of tenant to move out prior to completion plus others 7 searches to be done by the conveyancing lawyer.

What he means is that its simple to get an OTP prepared.And like i mentioned, the lawyer you engaged to represent you, can prepare one for you to use.  The OTP can be written to incorporate your specific terms.
 
Easy peasy.

I find it very amusing selling own property, car or buying insurance. . .
 
I like to engage a professional realtor, Insurance sale man or act dealer to deal with the nosey buyers, then my agent, salesman can represent me at all interest, I low there is nothing wrong in selling own house or car, but then how come so many are real estate salesman and insurance professionals here, my point of contention is these guys are trained professional in their respective fields of work and thy more or less knows their job well.
 
Of course they are some black sheeps in every fields, even policemen , there are bad eggs too, so I can't fathom the fact that ' must we really need to DIY own property ' to save few thousand dollars?
 
Not smart thinking here and definitely not a wise move.

Property agents are definitely professionals at digging money from you. The commission payable for selling a $1 million condo is $20000 (gst of $1400 not included yet), not few thousand dollars.  If the condo is $2 million,  the commission is $40000 (gst of $2800 not included yet), no small sum.

Don't just think on one side. Just like other businessmen, for one that make it, there are far more that could not make it
 
Similarly in a corporate world, there are a dozens on top that are millionaires. But many more  thousands below who are not.
 
I have said many times, only the top 20% agents earned 200k/year and above CONSISTENTLY.  The rest are getting by with referrals (auntie, uncle agents), and occasional wonder sale. You average out the earnings of this group, they don't earn much more than most corporate employees do especially when they don't have employer CPF contribution.

 
With property prices so high in Singapore, it is hard for property agents to have mediocre earnings unless you tell me throughout the whole year he only closes 1 sale. If there is such an agent, my advice for him/her is to leave the industry and concentrate on something else. Perhaps there had been many such agents leaving the industry which is why those at the top will always be at the top.

I don't begrudge any agent their commission if the create value by exploring unconventional avenues for sales (say overseas buyers etc).
 
But if all they are doing is advertising on propertyguru, gumtree and other common websites and then arranging the viewings, are they really earning the commission? For such agents, selling a 500k hdb and a 3 mil private apartment is the same amount of work isnt it?

Tolong with your FUD la. Many people have sold their own property without any problems. As long as you are willing to spend the time and effort, I see no reason why they need to be fearful of shit.
 
The fact is that Singaporeans buy properties that are disproportionate to their incomes so it still makes sense for people to sell their own property.

If sellers sell their own property, they can sell at a lower price to the buyer as they do not have to factor in the 2% commission and able to offer a cheaper price to the buyer. It is a win-win situation for the buyer and seller. No wonder there are websites like propertdirect coming up in Singapore.

Been there done that.
Several times, quite smoothly.
 
The key is to be professional and not personal when selling your own property.
That applies for own car, own watch, own everything.
 
Understand that other people may not have as good taste as yourself, so when they comment on somethings, just smile.

Actually, I realized that arranging viewings is not as simple as it seems. So many horrible  possibilities
 
1) Buyer schedule time, seller could not make it.  Seller re-propose time, buyer could not make it.  Agent has to keep re-coordinating
2) Seller propose time, buyer could not make it. Buyer re-propose time, seller could not make it. Agent has to keep re-coordinating
3) Both say could make it, Last minute one call and say cancel viewing. Agent got to apologise to the other, who is obviously not happy.
4) Both say could make it. Last minute one never turn up and remain uncontactable.  Agent has to face a very angry buyer/seller.
5) Both say could make it. Last minute one is late, very late. Agent has to apologise to the other and hope he will wait
6) Both say could make it. Both met on time only to realise it is a duplicate viewing. Agent has to apologise to both. Very common in a non-exclusive listing.
 
Not easy!!
 
Like many things in life, simple is not really that straightforward. Yes, the commission is hefty, but that's provided one has the resilience not to go mad and give up through all these possible mental torture and rejection on a daily basis.
 
No wonder some busy sellers/landlord give the keys to the agent and let them handle the viewing. I can understand that it must have been a traumatic experience for these busy seller/landlords in the past.

I don't deny that there will be all these issues but don't you think that cutting out one layer (the agent) actually solves at least half of these problems? By adding more layers in between, there is more risk of one party playing you out because they are dealing with an agent. Buyer or seller will think that agents are supposed to suffer like this since they are being paid whereas they would be more considerate when dealing with the actual party.
 
That being said, I won't begrudge an agent 5-7k for doing all this coordination work but when you're talking 20-40k, there had better be some value added service involved too (not that kind la). I've mentioned before that they will need to bring in non-traditional demand (not from propertyguru) like being able to attract overseas buyers or people who are not actively in the market.

If the question is can we? then the answer is yes, why not, we do know our own backsides best.
 
If you are asking, will we or need we? 
Then the answer is no.

I agree that removing one layer is always good.  There is this issue of conflict of interest. Agents collect com from only seller for private property so if a buyer walks into his ad, is the agent going to act in the best interest of the buyer or seller?  I know agents would hold on to the buyer and take him on a tour of properties these days since whatever property the buyer buys, he gets to earn cobroke com. Therefore the seller's listing to the agent is just one of those properties in his long list to show buyers.

It is not difficult to see that. Take this , an example from a friend :
 
A Month's deals :
1.Semi-d x 1 = (3mil x 1) x 1.5%  = 45k
2. HDB x 3 = (0.5mil x 3) x 1.5%  = $22.5k
3. Condo x 2 = (1.2mil x 2) x 1.5% = $36k
 
A Month's Total deals amount to $103k
 
If everyone is more savvy as time goes, each end up saving that couple of thousands. We hope to see a portal that is well regulate and that can protect both seller and buyer like Paypal eventually. Besides, the portal can pull resources together on legal related issues. This will definitely reduces more hidden cost.

1.Semi-d x 1 = (3mil x 1) x 1.5%  = 45k
2. HDB x 3 = (0.5mil x 3) x 1.5%  = $22.5k
3. Condo x 2 = (1.2mil x 2) x 1.5% = $36k
 
A Month's Total deals amount to $103k
 
If everyone is more savvy as time goes, each end up saving that couple of thousands. We hope to see a portal that is well regulate and that can protect both seller and buyer like Paypal eventually. Besides, the portal can pull resources together on legal related issues. This will definitely reduces more hidden cost.   

 
wow , HDB sales alone earned more than many of us....
 
very soon super white will set up such portal and suck in all the earnings themselves.  
Just like our Spool Portal

don't need high end lah.. common for mass market now to pay 2-3% or even more
 
Honestly, assuming if one month make around $30K in comms. Less off operating and marketing cost easily $5-7k a month if you work 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. The residual amount left is just $23-25K a month. 
 
I think that is very comparable to the typical 30-40 yr old white collar who makes $200-300K per annum ( all-in with bonus, CPF, medical and paid vacation & allowances)
 
If reward for agent goes lower, i doubt u can attract the good ones to stay. Might as well go back to the office. And this will go against CEA's vision to make agents more professional cos u get the not so good ones left

By my calculations, monthly gross salary of $12k already translate to $220k pa all in.
 
Isn't 12k quite average for mid career professional? Sorry i might be a little out of touch from the corporate world

start by buying a vintage Rolex every 3 mths
In about 5 yrs, you would hv accumulated about 20 Rolexes,
 
Thereafter, just sell and buy using the 20 Rolexes as initial inventory
You should be about to make a few grand every month.

You may want to carry out a survey and see how many in their 30s are paid 12k a month, is that the majority or the minority?  That is almost the pay of an assistant professor in NUS with a phd.

I think, is the matter of time agents are going out of jobs. That is already happening to insurances agents. The iOT is really a powerful tools, that is disrupting the economy order.

No way a principal is paid $15k a month which is already MP allowance.  I am quite certain assistant profs at uni are paid around that range not exceeding $20k a month. Many graduates out there in their 30s don't get more than $10k a month I am certain.

I don't think principals are on super scale. If they are, then what about inspectors from MOE who are higher in rank than the principal?  I won't be surprised most principals are paid less than 10k.

Anyway this was from 2007. There should be some hikes along the way.

How many principals make it to the H grade salary? Maybe less than 5% of all principals? Even then a good performing H grade principal gets $190k a year and only excellent ones cross the $200k mark.  I believe these are reserved for scholar principals orb those who are almost approaching retirement.

I have couple friends like that and incidentally the wife was also a teacher and husband just a blue collar worker.

If you are upgrading, it is a good time in my opinion. When market is weak, you sell low and buy low. Of course it is provided you have done your sum right.
 
There will always be another high, just when but to catch the lowest this is usually for people with the means. Buying to stay, not necessary it has to be the lowest price but the preferred home that meets you budget.

The table is about to turn? Know the significance? Under-estimate?
 
1. Trump may not work with us. Means more jobs back to USA. 60 - 70% SMEs depending on MNCs.
2. China took our military vehicles
3. China invested 14billion in JB and planning to build port better the PSA in Malacca .
4. Actually , Singapore have been enjoying the Trans-pacific-partnership benefits for years, even before it happens.
5. One-Belt One China is going to wipe us off the table. Just take a look at our geographical position and you will know what I meant.
6. Philippines president did critical of Singapore before.
 
There maybe tons of durians dropping in the next few years? Talents are here for reason. If we keep seeing Asia-pac US-HQs start pulling back ,supply chains and indirect related industries, there goes jobs. Better not put most eggs is one basket. That's my advice. That go-go days of the buying property is no longer repeat of the history. Unless we see bloodbath in the property market, which is not happening now, at all. Just caution note.
 
 
Waiting for what kind of durians?

The table is about to turn? Know the significance? Under-estimate?
 
1. Trump may not work with us. Means more jobs back to USA. 60 - 70% SMEs depending on MNCs.
2. China took our military vehicles
3. China invested 14billion in JB and planning to build port better the PSA in Malacca .
4. Actually , Singapore have been enjoying the Trans-pacific-partnership benefits for years, even before it happens.
5. One-Belt One China is going to wipe us off the table. Just take a look at our geographical position and you will know what I meant.
6. Philippines president did critical of Singapore before.
 
There maybe tons of durians dropping in the next few years? Talents are here for reason. If we keep seeing Asia-pac US-HQs start pulling back ,supply chains and indirect related industries, there goes jobs. Better not put most eggs is one basket. That's my advice. That go-go days of the buying property is no longer repeat of the history. Unless we see bloodbath in the property market, which is not happening now, at all. Just caution note.
Just know this Brother... 
Singapore should never have existed as a country.

I am seeing my business is no longer as usual, even operating in lower cost Malaysia. US customers are working with us the possibility of operating in US.  i am not sure is this happening in other industries. The worrying part is, we are mostly depending on US. Even Singapore tried to push through TPP with Japan, I doubt much juice left without US.
What worries me, is US currently taxing cooperate around 40% over or more. Tax incentive can be easily adjust to bring jobs home. While US may potentially tax much higher for those operating off-shore. Therefore it makes sense for offices and factories to move back. If that really materialize, our currency will be affected. Another main problem is , we are nowhere Silicon Valley nor manufacturing power house. Moreover our cost of employing people here are neither cheap. 
So all these factors does need to consider before investments. I do know many turn a blind-eye to it. But it does matter. Singapore use to be and now is :
 
1. Strong in IP.
2. Secure place.
3. Low tax incentive.
 
But 1 and 3, can be easily turn the table. Whereas, 2 can be build overtime. Besides, we still do not have the critical mass to sustain by itself, as compare to Malaysia , Indonesia , China , US or Europe. Even though, Malaysia still need investments to come in. I am not saying not to buy property here. One have extra and the rest to other places , that's ok. But if it is depending on rental to cover loans, than think twice of the risk involve.  
 
Nobody have ever dream of UK breaking off, most though all just a bag of hot air. It happened. None have though oil price would ever crash, but it happens. No one though Trump wins, again it happens. There goes, the unimaginable.  You guess the next?
 
Recently, we see foreigners start buying up Singapore properties. And that seem to show the confidence of Singapore. But have anyone knows where are those money coming from?? I do believe they can afford to lose it?   
 
Lastly Malaysian PM rush to China after the Trump wins. Singapore president goes to Japan. What is this trying telling us?

Thanks for the efforts elaborating. 
Brexit and Trump have both been raised by me of 50-50 chance of happening. Modern democracies have this issue. 
 
Everything traces back to spending and debts. Govt debts help people feel good in the short term, and US and many EU countries have been loading up on it for decades, but it risks the welfare of the next generation.
 
The moment they off the tap, the people vote against. 
 
Now how would the new leaders respond?
 
China with its huge funds still run short of funds for all its plans. Internationally funds cannot simultaneously commit to the same cause.
 
If it's so easy to implement your points 1-3 anywhere else, SG would not have existed in the first place.
 
Agree that we are still very trade dependent. Does US like to talk directly with China now that Trump is in charge? How about China to India?

Unemployment in US is already at 4.6%. It neither needs nor can handle companies' rising costs (in the face of rising USD???) returning operations back, many of which are currently specialised industries tapping on low costs of less developed countries. It also does not have that many of qualified personnel in each of these specialised industries. In all, it is smooth talk and nice campaign move - that is about it.

I believe you are referring to manufacturing, that was already mostly moved out of Singapore. What I was referring is the offices. That is where most PMETs are. PMETs are no longer cheap to hire in Singapore. If you compare Singapore PMETs and US, you will see not much differences. In some post , they are in fact cheaper than us. 
When I hire PMETs in Malaysia when I shifted my manufacturing operations 2 years back, is 2.4 times cheaper than hiring in Singapore. As you know, 70%-80% Singapore's workforce are PMETs. So I can see we maybe the hardest hit, if the TPP and other Trade arrangement are pull back.
Hopefully, what you said, all smooth talk and hot air, is about it. If not , it is going to be hard for our children. 
 
Well let see, what Trump have in his sleeves in Jan 2017. As we know, the One-Belt-One-China is not for us. Without US, we will become an ulu ulu island.

We have always been and still is an ulu ulu island.
 
Most people in the west and Europe think we are somewhere in China.
 
We actually don't quite exist. We never did. Every major China city is bigger than us whichever demographics we use.
 
Trump also said he will target and stop immigration. How to stop immigration and yet have good jobs reserved for unqualified locals in US to fill up all the PMET roles? It's not just a tall order. His talks are targeted for maximum political mileage but many of his stances are contradictory to begin with.

I think you still pay ABSD for the first purchase. It is subsequent sales or purchases that you will be able to avoid the tax.
 
If you have doubts, can ask Hsien Loong. Tiakong he created had a company for the oxley property so he should be well versed in this tax avoidance strategy.

I live in an EC and was part of their 300 member whatsapp chat and facebook group. This means I've seen a lot of ridiculous whining by stupid people.
 
Why don't you post your expectations of an EC (and how it will be superior over a HDB) and I can advise if it is reasonable or not.

EC no good meh?  2 of my relatives also used to live in EC and private condo, both sold and live in HDB now, both find the facilities white elephant.
 
To me, more for my family lor, they swim a lot.  To me, I won't use the facilities much as I'm quite lazy.   [laugh] .   I also need an additional bedroom for my growing kids as one of my HDB bedroom is damn small - too small to be a bedroom.

To me, more for my family lor, they swim a lot.  To me, I won't use the facilities much as I'm quite lazy.   [laugh] .   I also need an additional bedroom for my growing kids as one of my HDB bedroom is damn small - too small to be a bedroom.
 

 
I didn't say no good. I was just asking what your expectations are.
 
If it is just those 2 that you listed, I don't think it is worth the inconvenience of a poorer location (unless everyone drives) and also the higher prices.

Ya I find the location no good too - very deep in and have to walk 10 mins to the nearest LRT.  Quite inconvenient for my kids to travel in future. 
 
My house now - the LRT is just beside my block and I can choose to walk to either Buangkok or SK MRT if I dun want to take LRT.   After my car reaches 10 years, I may not drive liao.
 
Thanks ya.

Somehow the concept of "private" always equate to upgrade.
I have the same experience that most people simply disregard to mention the more important factors of location, size and psf (value).
 
The word "private" is so conveniently used to blanket over all other considerations.

Looking at floor plans, cannot have a queen size bed with two side table and wardrobe.
 
At least HDB , at least in my case, can put a tv on the wall, two side table. Wardrope and a yoga mat.

some of those in the 30s to 40s are still struggling to find what career choice makes sense in this new "equitable" island of FT and PR and Singaporean in this disruptive economy some called it MRT, I called it by what it is the great Digital divide.
 
Some more pragmatic than others are getting loan for their HDB while others are still chasing that Atas image of a poverty condo called EC by buying the most that their loan wont burst and wondering if 30 years is enough to pay them off with a view of hedging it against the market and sell when the prices goes up just to earn and switch to a better pte condo. Hoping against hope but are none the wiser if by then the pte condo will also move correspondingly higher.
 
And if you have children, which the current generation are avoiding because they do see the kind of opportunity that will exist as Singaporean with the way the hiring market and economy are shape. They just want to lead a life of status quo. So the number of reproduce singaporean becomes lower. Of course there are other who wants to have children and see a great and stable place to raise their kids and then return back to their country as well.
 
So they think of the children education and try to see how the next generation can pursue their dreams. Perhaps elsewhere. 
 
May be if we kept on the old formula 30 years back, it wont be so bad. ?
Have more population growth and we were bought up to chase after the 5C. So getting a poverty specs BMW 218 3 cylinder engine that we used to laugh at from Daihatsu isn't so bad after all.
 
You try to climb the corporate ladder and continue to kaotao to the boss just to meet the demands of your huge loans and suffer and fear for job losses because the boss need to sacrifice someone and that means you, to meet the shareholder equity returns and then there's the dirty word. "Get real. We don't owe u a living."
 
So you become greedy. Greedy for getting the next promotion or the next bonus but will never get because its always the bar has been raise and they average out your performance but the quota for next year will be 40% more than what you achieve this year. 
 
It has being in our culture for too long, thru material possession and ruthless "no one owes u a living" everyone starts to lose that kampong spirit where we leave no one behind becomes a vision rather than a mission statement.
 
You start to pursue your behalf and have something to show for it and thats how you are measured for success. Not the loving relationship of your wife. Not the amount of care you have time to share with your neighbours but by having 3 pointed stars car key and diesel perhaps plonk on the kopitiam table.
 
That's how you deem successful ?
 
You can use that formula but at this point in time in our situation and difficult time, for some who still thnks everything is super fine. This approach wont last .
 
It display a poverty of what your future lies and where you are headed in life.
 
This display of appearance over substance of what atas-ness over character.
Over short-term gains over lasting achievement is like a 30 sec commercial.
 
It compromises your value and your principals because you need to meet the numbers and by hook or by crook you need to do it.
 
To me the hallmark of sucess is what inclusion means, family values not happy happy divoice and move on to a china wife is what I consider sucessful in life.

Don't judge lah. Location is subjective right? Some people prefer privacy and in more ulu location while others prefer near the city etc. doesn't mean moving to a more happening place means better location. From my experience in property hunting, most of the "best" location condos near MRT in the city are actually being rented out, while Singaporeans, being Singaporeans, actually prefer to stay in more obscure locations. Like many of my friends, our good location condos are rented out, while we choose to stay in less convenient abodes. Is this a downgrade? I don't think so.

I dont know i never check.
Hdb i just buy to stay for fun.
 
Yishun is not practical for me either.
I data enter in CHangi.
 
Nowadays, i dont care too much about how much money i can make.
I care more about how much value i can extract from something that i buy.
 
If you dont understand what i mean, just imagine this.
You are stranded in the desert with a briefcase full of cash (say $600,000 usd) 
You are almost dying of thirst.
I come by and sell you a can of coke for $500, and you would still be thankful.
 
Cheers and good luck in your property investments

wow i didnt even check that far into. from what i understand from the agent in the ec at https://www.property...ec-condominium/., seems that how punggol and sengkang was built is that they were built from inside and then towards the sea. so if u are inland, someday u will be blocked. anyone staying near this side? any insights? me never stay at northeast before.

Who wants to face the sea in Punggol? Take a drive to Punggol jetty and you will see the entire stretch of factories in clear view across in Malaysia. The pollution from Pasir Gudang petrochemical plant can be smelt not just in punggol and sengkang, but all the way to Pasir ris. This is something govt don't want people to pay attention to otherwise they will have problems selling their flats in punggol.

yeah location and urban planning is good to review before you plonk the biggest investment / ticket item in your life on.
 
You lucky you did not get caught up in the earlier years like the palette and some of the fast moving condo .
 
Before you can say I want .. the sales guy say sold liao
 
Then u kangchiong spider any how wack. Thats how my fren kanna afternoon sun unit 
 
His profile is more calm and analytical before buying stuff. Of course, he also wants that atas feel of being workship and serve when buying. End up screw up big time.

the music is starting to slow down and may stop and time with the fed chairman stepping down and interest rate soon to rise.
 
At least while the going was good, all those that bought 2 to 3 condo and stay at HDB should be able to cash out one unit and take the other for rental yield.
 
When interest rate rise, offset with full cash

Well that depends on your property price compared to a few years ago.
 
As we all know, private property price declines for 15 quarters before the recent reversal in September.
 
https://www.edgeprop.sg/tags/property-price-index
 

 
To check whether you sell at a good price, you might want to check your property value 4 years ago.

Anyone considering the D5 area?
The ports should be moving out, so there is a potential upside with a second CBD being built there, high end condos and a nice waterfront for recreation..

I don't mean to stir debate. Just curious what is the reason to believe that it's not a good time to buy.

The taxes (ABSD, stamp duty) are crazy? If buying to invest, have to factor in these additional costs.

Avoid these areas. As mentioned by the quote below, and the jams as well.
 
Who wants to face the sea in Punggol? Take a drive to Punggol jetty and you will see the entire stretch of factories in clear view across in Malaysia. The pollution from Pasir Gudang petrochemical plant can be smelt not just in punggol and sengkang, but all the way to Pasir ris. This is something govt don't want people to pay attention to otherwise they will have problems selling their flats in punggol.

I dont think smart is the word. Cautious most probably. Else, those that have gone in earlier may not find prices attractive now.
 
My sister for one. Bought in the 90's donkey years ago.
 
Ask her to sell and move on.
 
She is asking where to get something almost same price and appreciate in value, yet newer and better.

It is good to see that the agencies are finally collaborating onto something. They should have done this even long before CEA comes onboard.
 
But I hope they don't just collaborate on digital technologies. They should also collaborate in terms or alignment of practices between agents, regulations, enforcement, and take initiative to improve the standard of agents.

I think the scary part is who can afford the > 1500 psf + ABSD to derive profit 3 years down the road when trying to offload.

I think it is a good time to find good buy and good time to sell.
 
Btw i would like to share on this good buy new launch.
 
Hottest New Launch 2018- Twin VEW  fr $6xxK Opens 21 Apr 
 
Another up and coming new condo will be launched this upcoming Sat 21 April 2018.  It is probably the hottest and most highly anticipated launch in the West in 2018. With the successful sellout of Parc Riviera within a year and the aggressive land bid by CDL (at $800 ppr) at the next adjoining site , Without a doubt , Twin View (with land cost at $592 ppr) is a real bargain with huge potential upside .
 
The location of Twin Vew is the biggest draw for the buyer. It is just 5 mins from the 2nd CBD and the High Speen Rail ,this project is a gateway to limitless opportunities with the creation of more than 100,00 potential employment! Expats working in the nearby at International Business Park, Alexandra Business Park, Science Park, NUS and One North have been attracted to the area.
It also provides an ease with its accessibility from the cities.
 
Twin View condominium is a new launch project by the reputable China Construction Development which has a good 25 years of experience in quality construction of buildings in Singapore.  It sits on a land parcel of 16,378.3 square meters with a 99-year old lease. There are 520 unit comprising of 1 bedroom, 2 bedrooms, 3 bedrooms and 4 bedrooms and a child care within the project. The expected selling price of the units will be around S$1,3xx psf.
 
The plot of land is located near to the city as well as Buona Vista Exchange. There are also many other facilities and amenities located near to the development. Outdoor parks nearby include Kent Ridge Park as well as West Coast Park where you can enjoy a quiet stroll along the greenery park trails.
 
As the west would be one of the next up & coming to be as the next stage of the Greater Jurong Lake Districk master plan revs into action.
 
Starting from a very attractively price ONLY from $6xxK upwards.

why do we have two similar threads running?Up doesn’t mean it’s a good time to buy  
Down doesn’t mean it’s a good time to sell.
 
Up can go higher but that doesn’t mean we can afford to buy.
 
Down can go lower doesn’t mean we can easily sell.
