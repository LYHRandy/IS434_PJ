 Condo-style losing allure 
Falling prices in private home market chipping away at demand for DBSS flats 
By Joyce Teo, Property Correspondent 
 
PRICEY condo-style HDB flats have not been spared in the property downturn, going by what has been left for sale at Park Central @ AMK. 
 
While over 70 per cent of the project's 578 units have been sold, the larger five-room units costing $600,000 to $670,000 each are still available. 
 
These levels put the flats in the same price bracket as older condominiums, which might prompt some potential HDB buyers to turn to the private home market, where prices are falling. 
 
Developer United Engineers announced the figures yesterday, and also said foundation works had begun at the Ang Mo Kio estate, which is being developed under the HDB's design, build and sell scheme (DBSS). Under the scheme, public flats are designed, built and sold by private developers. 
 
Sales at Park Central have been favourable in view of the challenging economic climate, said Mr David Liew, the managing director of the group's integrated facility management and property development business. 
 
Buyers include young couples, retirees and those with proceeds from collective sales, the group said. 
 
The DBSS concept has been quite popular, but some experts fear the fall in private condo prices could leave buyers spoilt for choice. 
 
Price is the key factor in DBSS projects as they are targeted at HDB buyers whose household income must not exceed $8,000 a month. 
 
'It's a price-sensitive sector. These buyers can choose between HDB flats and lower-end condos,' said Associate Professor Sing Tien Foo, the deputy head of the National University of Singapore's real estate department. 
 
'During a downturn, the price gap between these segments will narrow, so demand (at DBSS projects) may be affected,' he noted. 
 
Most DBSS flats are priced at $500,000 to $700,000 each, roughly the level for executive condos, said ERA Asia Pacific associate director Eugene Lim. 'There is already an overlap.' 
 
For a $600,000 unit, the monthly instalment on a 30-year, 80 per cent loan is about $2,000, assuming an interest rate of 2.6 per cent. 
 
When the property market was rising in 2006, DBSS products met the needs of buyers who could not afford private homes. 
 
The first such project, Premiere @ Tampines, was an instant hit, drawing 5,700 applications for 616 homes in late 2006. Although it sold only 500 flats initially, long queues formed when the remaining units were released for sale. 
 
City View @ Boon Keng received 3,500 applications for 714 flats early this year, but only 460 were sold. Nearly 90 per cent of the flats have since been taken up, including all the three-roomers. 
 
Park Central, Singapore's third DBSS project, garnered more than 2,300 applications. Prices average $490 to $500 per sq ft, putting the four-roomers at between $400,000 and $500,000 each. 
 
The fourth DBSS project - Natura Loft in Bishan - saw about 680 applications for 480 flats last month. Its four-room units go for $465,000 to $586,000 each, while its five-roomers cost $600,000 to $739,000. 
 
Once prices go above $600,000, the flats will be competing with old leasehold condos, executive condos and bigger executive flats, said Knight Frank's director of research and consultancy, Mr Nicholas Mak. 
 
Unlike exec condos, which are initially subject to sale restrictions similar to those on public housing units, but become fully private after 10 years, a DBSS unit is just a value-added HDB flat, he said. 
 
Indeed, demand for DBSS flats might be more severely affected than that for other segments as potential buyers have more choices, said Dr Sing. 
 
Nevertheless, Mr Mak feels the DBSS concept is sustainable if the Government accepts lower land prices.  
 
The problem is that most developers of DBSS sites bought them in good times. 
 
There are two DBSS projects slated for launch in the first half of next year: one in Simei and a huge project of nearly 1,200 units in Toa Payoh.

Seriously all the projects after Tampines's The Premiere are ridiculously overpriced.... only the Premiere's pricing is

The Premiere pricing was ok because it was launched just before the ppty market got bullish..if it was launched early this yr, you can expect it to be selling at least 100K more..

Are you sure what you are talking about?
 
The Pappy sheltered Sinkies are risk adverse and most won't dare to take a private loan to bank roll on their condo.
 
They rather let H the D and B run their life and provide that roof over their Sinkie heads even though they know they are paying for a worthless piece of pigeon Hole and at such prices somemore!
 
Moreover, these Sinkie have a mentality of complaining why should they pay so much maintanence fees like in private condos....so they feel safe choosing such pigeon holes!
 
So you see, bro...it is the mentality mindset that had gotten hold of the typical HDB Sinkies and this is where the Pappies play to their advantage.
 
You can called it.... years of Nanny feeding that resulted in the eventual belief that the MIWs are always providing the best value for them even though a BLIND man can see otherwise!

When you play the game according to the Master's wishes, you do get rewarded in some way.
 
This is called virtual rewards.
 
Whether you are rewarded with gains that are only paper in value and make you feel delighted that you have made money is immaterial.
 
Simply becos there isn't any REAL material gain unless you decide to 'boot yourself' outta here and recover back what is in actual value of worth, that you will take along with you. 
 
Called it paying obedience to the Master and you shall have a good feeling.
 
For as long as you 'stick around', the Master will make you 'feel rich' but it is only a feeling that you think you are getting!
 
So are you happy?

combined 8K monthly pay can afford a 600-700K flat?
 
HDB is encouraging people to spend beyond their means

Actually, it was before the sand crisis issue by our neighbours. After that, everything started upwards... i believe a couple of mths after the launch of the Premiere...

YES.
 
My valuation has dropped between 300k to 500k depending on bank.

Your valuation drop doesn't mean the price of the property will follow just as much....
 
Valuation drops to allow lender to lower lending amount to mininise lending risk.. that is the fundmental of how a lender keeps his lending risk at a certain acceptable level.
 
So ppl are made to 'top-up' once your valuation drops below what the lender would termed as ...your initial risk has incresed to a new level the lender is not willing to accomoadte to. 
 
So in short, the current suituation would be lenders are risk adverse while property sellers are not able to lower prices further...leading to many having difficulty making up the difference in price to loan obtained.

its a cycle, valuation drop, more bank rejection, less demand, property sell lower, etc
 
Yes valuation is the amount of risk the lender is willing to take but which will also translates to the price the people will buy just that it will take time.

just to add, in a rising market, people will transact above valuation as the belief is taht prices will get there, and in a falling market people will transact below valuation as people believe the prices will get there too. 
 
as bernanke says, it's not price movement but price expectations that causes inflation (in this case asset inflation or deflation).

Well, only goons or desperados for condos will buy at those prices in Balestier. $1000psf ?   hahahaha
 
D9 will see low $1000psf soon enough.  
Balestier area to me is worth $650psf at very best.  
 
Agents have asked me to disregard the published prices and simply make an offer if i'm a genuine buyer.  I told them, i'm not ready to buy at this point in time. Supply is plentiful and prices have not fully reflected this fact yet.

few day later the agent call up my colleague again telling him ok, if you really want to buy, how much you want to pay for it?

tell those agents...alr got people launching new condos at prime areas such as river valley road (near hoot kiam rd also) at $1200 psf...places like balestier how to command $1000 psf??? even Novena condos I believe can be had now for less than $1100 psf(novena area considered slightly less prime than river valley)..balestier if got $800 psf alr tao chio liao..
