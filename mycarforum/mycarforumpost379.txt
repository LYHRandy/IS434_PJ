Cashew better transportation I think with Downtown line). Lentor environment is more laid back and more green (until they start more development).  Capital appreciation as a percentage probably will be the same. Both half ulu.

With the new TEL coming out, Lentor will be as accessible as Cashew if not better.
Aren't they far from each other? Which is more convenient for u.Both locations work for me.

agreed. Cashew near bukit panjang is a truly jam crap area. limited access roads out of there. only BKE and upper bukit timah road. unless one travels to jurong  or woodlands. its a no no location for me.
 
with Lentor you have many more access roads out of the area

Yes no offense but i dont like cck or bukit panjang area, esp if drive there feel so congested.  
But lentor feel more exclusive and surrounded by a lot private estates hence less crowded

Prestige? What privilege other than maybe need to pay higher prices to contractors the minute u mention terrace, semi-d or landed.
 
Just my tots. I vote for Lentor since ease of trpt is similar. Less busy and more greens, er, not vegetables species. Not sure which is more prestigious. Maybe if ID can do some magic,  your house entrance can be majestically or really eye catching to make it stand out. Wow factor type. 
 
Safe ride

Same same, but very different...
Lentor:
- v quiet rustic feel
- new MRT station nearby (Thomson Line)
- mostly 999 years but that's semantics
- roads are quite narrow, especially the Countryside lane
- the older units have a larger land area, the newer (under 20 yrs) units are narrow and you are really close to your neighbor - if you want to do a sound system, acoustic treatment will be vital
- check plot ratio, some can go up to 3.5 floors
- nice place for those don't need to go to the CDB
- limited schools within the vicinity 
- supermarkets - you need to drive out, and amenities are limited until you reach AMK or Yishun
- roads - CTE is a perpetual car park, and you need to weave around the estate to get out if your unit is deep in
- Upper Thomson Road will get more crowded
- resale: well there are many units around you, so mid level of desirability, i.e. buy lower, sell lower compared to CCR areas
 
Cashew
- older estate
- also mainly 999 years
- quiet, and near to the reserve
- Cashew MRT on the Downtown Line - better for the CBD crowd
- facilities - you also need to drive out, limited amenities within walking distance, so you need to reach Bukit Timah, Hillview areas and maybe Railmall (which has been sold)
- there's an artery road outside, and you also need to weave a bit to get out. That main road does get very busy during peak hours but PIE is not far
- schools, limited but there are some close by, whether they are desirable, that's a different thing
- plot sizes seem a little bigger, but you need to check on the psf and also the plot ratio but many may offer up to 3.5 floors
- resale, another buy lower, sell lower spot. Not one that will climb in value exponentially unless the market boils up
 
That's it :)

3. Accessibility
Dunno about 1 or 2 but accessibility wise Lentor wins hands down I think. 
I live in lentor area for 10 years. My in laww also live there for over 30 years.
 
There are a lot of misinformation in some of the posts here.
 
YCK MRT is around 1km from my place and I walk there sometimes. New Lentor mrt is even closer so technically I have two mrt lines.
 
 My in laws close to 70 years old, no car, walk to 628 market everyday which is also around 1km from their place. There is a public bus that runs through the estate connecting to yck mrt.
 
The internal roads are wide enough to park a car on each side and still let through traffic. Most importanly, in certain developments like Countryside, instead of building it to the max and ending roads in a dead end, the developer cut back quite a few units to join roads. These roads have ZERO units opening into them and are used a free parking spaces for residents. Just look at google map. I stay there for 10 years, zero parking problems. Even in chinese new year, also can find park which is amazing. 
 
The other thing is the park/playground to unit ratio is very high for Lentor compared to places like serangoon gardens, upper thomson. I don't know why but there are a lot of park/playgrounds here....
 
Driving you have CTE which is not too bad plus new NS expressway.
 
Prestige wise one of our million dollar minister stay at Lentor :)

I like the prata place. With Thomson line the accessibility goes up by a lot. Else there is literally nothing.
 
Lentor is at amk so there are quite a few stuff within walking distance provided your unit is not too nested in.

Yup, I am an expert in Lentor area cuz I looked around for a place in that area 10 years ago because my wife lived there. 
 
If u are buying a place, u should know exactly where the ns expressway is..... countryside road is near expressway. 
 
One thing bad is recently the new Seletar airport has caused planes to fly overhead our estate. Not big jets but still can hear. Seems to be improving since Malaysia removed the restricted air space but it is a point to note and a risk.

not military plane lah... If military plane, then probably not seletar airport.
 
Seletar airport now is open for commercial traffic. When malaysia not happy, all planes land from south so that time, every night can hear a few.
 
Now after malaysia open their air space, I don't hear any plane on most nights. 
 
But it is not loud as usually the plane is the small kind. I can't hear anything in my bedroom (casement windows) with aircon on. 
 
My downstairs computer room has sliding windows so the noise isolation is poor. That room can hear.
FireFly planes then

There is another hawker center along Upper Thomson near Pierce Reservoir.

I am quite surprised that TS is looking between lentor and Cashew which are so far apart. It is hard to find someone how is familiar in both estates to do a fair comparison. 
 
To me, the family and school factor trumps everything. I was planning to send my kid to Rosyth because we are old boy/girl. Also needs to be close to in laws to take care of kids.

Is 1700 psf reasonable for a 999?

I'm guessing you are referring to this?
https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/listing/21635721/for-sale-cashew-crescent
 
1700 psf sounds rather ex.. Lentor prices are around 1300 psf.
If you can only spend under 3 mil, there are still choices.
Don't forget you need another war chest of about 3-400k for reno / fittings etc. These places aren't in move in condition. 
Also, the land area is only 1616 sq ft. Your resale value is mainly dependant on the land plot size, so there's not a lot of upside, especially if you pay such a high price.
 
560m walk to an MRT is good though, and the roads here are wider than those around the Countryside. 
 
If you aren't particular, also consider the West Coast area around Pasir Panjang MRT. There's a hawker centre, Vivo is two stops away, it's quiet and the potential upside from the Greater Southern Waterfront. And since you can fork out 1700 psf, you can definitely find something here too.
 
But hey, why use a forum to solicit opinions? Surely you, and your wife, plus your agent would have shortlisted some areas? Her opinion will be vital...

If it is 2.9M, interest alone (assuming 2.7%) 6.5K a month.
 
Can use 3.5K - 4.5K to rent a bigger semi-D (try each estate for a year) and save the remaining 2-3K or use it to get a nice car.

I personally have not encountered any bad traffic jams in the morning or after work.
 
Anyway I thought that place was fairly cheap and can get decent sized detached or bungalows without breaking the bank. Lots of space for big gardens and for my kids to run around too.

the difference in psf is so huge, hence my question on privileges.  is Cashew so special to justify the difference.
 
again, Countryside lanes are wide.  Lentor lanes are narrow.
 
west coast units are very rare for sale and need rebuilt normally due to the bad condition.

Not really bro. Units there are less than 30 years and you have to keep a lookout. Remember there's West Coast i.e. Farrer, and Clementi or next Ginza Plaza and there's West Coast near Pasir Panjang MRT, such as Jambol area.
Looking at the last transacted prices, you can get something under 3mil. 
Eg previously the owner of no 9 Jambol Place was asking 2.85mil for his 1616 sq feet unit. 200m to the MRT, quiet and three stories.. there will be shops at the Bijou condo, and across the road is the new PSA building, with stores inside. 1 train stop from ARC, 3 stops from Vivo (where there's a library), and NTUC Extra coming up.
 
No one will give you a free pass bro, you have to look out for deals... and be prepared to have your check ready at the first viewing. Yes, you heard me right. One shot, one kill. Sometimes that's how it rolls. 
So do your financial homework first. If you are still shooting the breeze, you may miss some units.
 
Eg, in the third quarter of 2018, a Ming Teck Park unit was sold for 2.8mil. Facing greenery, and 1800 sq ft. How's that. 1km to Henry Park too.
But now it's gone. Different times, different prices.. 

I didn't like Cashew.. so try West Coast bro... you set the cap and budget limits.. so you get what you pay for..

An extensive reno can run into >300k. Not A&A which costs more, and a rebuild will cost 600k and up, when you find a nice place, I can share a good contractor with you.
Do your homework, that's my suggestion, and honestly, you are a little behind the game... prices have consolidated a bit.
 
2017 to 2018 first half was a much better time to shop... but don't get disheartened, there are still nice places. 
The thing about landed is that you have to look, ask for non-listed units, don't just look at Prop guru, but there are other sites. Also use the notification emails to let you know if a place meets your criteria. Cheers

Eg, you can try and knock down the price here a bit:
https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/listing/21199754/for-sale-chelsea-village
 
If you can afford 1700 psf, this will be close to your budget..
460m to PP MRT. Very quiet neighbourhood.

I didn't like Cashew.. so try West Coast bro... you set the cap and budget limits.. so you get what you pay for..

An extensive reno can run into >300k. Not A&A which costs more, and a rebuild will cost 600k and up, when you find a nice place, I can share a good contractor with you.
Do your homework, that's my suggestion, and honestly, you are a little behind the game... prices have consolidated a bit.
 
2017 to 2018 first half was a much better time to shop... but don't get disheartened, there are still nice places. 
The thing about landed is that you have to look, ask for non-listed units, don't just look at Prop guru, but there are other sites. Also use the notification emails to let you know if a place meets your criteria. Cheers

Eg, you can try and knock down the price here a bit:
https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/listing/21199754/for-sale-chelsea-village
 
If you can afford 1700 psf, this will be close to your budget..
460m to PP MRT. Very quiet neighbourhood. 

 
very informative, thanks a lot!  are you an agent?  
 
I looking at below 3mil landed, not that I can afford 1700 psf.

I am quite surprised that TS is looking between lentor and Cashew which are so far apart. It is hard to find someone how is familiar in both estates to do a fair comparison. 
 
To me, the family and school factor trumps everything. I was planning to send my kid to Rosyth because we are old boy/girl. Also needs to be close to in laws to take care of kids. 

 
Maybe TS prefers one location and the wife prefers the other one.
 
I used to stay in Kovan area nearer to town. There is a nice park which I exercise there often. I used to see people trading items like rolex watches, Phones, etc. They will drive their Mercedes, Porsche and meet there. (Sounds familiar)
 
I just move near Lentor, quieter but further from my workplace. Wife wants to move because nearer to St Nicholas and also price cheaper than Kovan/Charlton.

Lentor estate itself or somewhere near it? Thomson hills is near st Nicholas. My mum stays there :) so I am stuck in this area. I do prefer Lentor more than Thomson hills as I feel it is less messy. Thomson hill can get a bigger place though for similar price. 
I personally don’t like Kovan. Getting to the expressway looks tough, busy roads. I think if u drive, the time it takes to reach the expressway is impt so I am not sure if it is actually nearer to town in terms of time.

We started at our affordability for landed, Lentor and Cashew pops out.  Other areas also popped out but we don’t like those areas.

Ouch. Reading these comments made me feel bad about living in Cashew lol.
 
I personally have not encountered any bad traffic jams in the morning or after work.
 
Anyway I thought that place was fairly cheap and can get decent sized detached or bungalows without breaking the bank. Lots of space for big gardens and for my kids to run around too.

I never say anything bad about cashew. Never visited there :) 
 
I think house location is very subjective. Depends on each family.

I did not checked out my 2 next door neighbour before buying but they turned out to be the quiet sort. No teenage kids, no parties, small family. No parking quarrels. To be frank another part of countryside has a neighbour quarrel that went on newspaper many years back....
 
But we are also model resident. Always park in garage. Small family, Super quiet, Super clean.

As mentioned in the topic title, which place is the better choice in term of:
 
1. Privilege
2. Capital appreciation
3. Accessibility

TS If you have narrowed down to only these two areas , you might have difficulties finding what you want. Some of the basic landed considerations are layout, interior, land size, build up, facing , rooms , toilets , whether cul de sac or other preference etc, more challenging is if you have certain budget. Unless you have the time and financial power to rebuild, otherwise be prepared to spend up to a year or more to find one that you like. the other consideration, if you find a unit that you like, likelihood many other potential buyers would be eyeing as well, so when you find what you like, dont procrastinate for too long before the unit is gone.  sharing my experience.  good luck.

the two areas you mentioned could find slightly below 3m but too far below wont be in decent move in condition. in fact most 2.5 m below will not be in move in condition without a major reno. You should  get as many agents as possible and pass them your requirement, they will feed you with rubbish selection but at least you can filter it yourself accordingly.  There is no need to entertain every offer for viewing, but the more you view the more you will be familiar with landed.

I agree. This is often overlooked or undermined. 
A friend shared how he bot a house near Upp Thomson a few years back. Did not see neighbours when viewed house twice. Seemed quiet at both times. 
 
Moved in. Got a shock when human faeces thrown over a common wall into car pouch area. This takes place a few times a week. Went over to confront. Old lady very fierce, say my friend and wifey too noisy,  disturbed her sleep etc. Their bedroom is not near the entrance ya.
 
Friend and wifey only occupants in house. No kids then. Go out early to work, come home late. No lion dance type of noise. They so tired, just shower and then go sleep, he say what noise? 
 
Then knives of all sizes hung from neighbour's side greeted them one morning. Really alot of knives. 
 
They waited and saw a man who looked like that woman's son. Asked him why throw faeces over and hang knives. Answer? Not happy, move out.

Yep
- location
- sun direction
- developer matters too
- neighbours
- visit the location at different times - if you go over a weekend it's usually quiet and the traffic is light
- amenities eg market, food places, 24 grocer, petrol station, postbox
- near work
- near polyclinic or GP
- MRT, bus etc to work
- wind
- the interior of the place, can you salvage the parquet floor for example
- plot ratio and GFA
- zoning and potential developments of the area
- cul de sac 
- land size, is it square or narrow, can you expand the built up area? (remember to account for set back if you do more than A&A)
- TV reception
- is there a fibre / home line (will cost $288 to run a new fibre line for example)
- soil analysis - is it reclaim land
- fengshui : water, wind and mountains etc
- at a junction
- noise level in the neighbourhood
- any new developments - renovations or reconstruction can continue for years around the place
- is there going to be enbloc or a new road running through the area
- if the homes near you are going to be replaced by flats, the roads can be much busier
- parking
- flooding / ponding
- any religious building around you eg illegal parking during peak periods and noise levels

Don’t forget to check for termites and mossies. 
How windy and well ventilated the place is. 
How wide is your lane and even the type of roof and tiles used. 
Bring a builder along to give you an idea of renovation costs..

looking for your perfect home is a happy problem. Mine search was 30 years ago. Just to share, I see everything on offer even those above budget. Without knowing what is above or below, you never know it is a good deal.
 
Ultimately, I have always planned to renovate to meet my own needs. So a run down house is always preferred. Why? I don't want to pay for renovation done that I need to tear down again. The savings will go to renovating to what I need. Good luck to those searching.

YepThat’s why I said do the financials first. Make sure you have a loan approved in principle and also enough cash for the renovations with a 20 percent buffer. 
Then bring the check book for every viewing. 
I lost one unit because we had decision paralysis. Kenna potong by an agent who slipped in an offer

One more thing 
If you are getting on in age, ask yourself if really want a landed. 
Say your kids are all grown up, and you may be getting some knee issues ..
Is landed the best option?
Sure there’s a certain ‘I’ve arrived’ moniker but you may not get the utility you want. The kids may move out soon, there are certain maintenance costs esp if you have a large garden. Don’t forget painting, cleaning up and insects etc. 
food for thought 
If you can manage to buy one when you are in your 30s, you get the most out of it.

Very true, if you are 'old' living on your own and do not have that energy,  you probably want a small apartment.  However, lifestyle for landed and apartment are quite different.  Don't forget for condo, you also have the maintenance fee and having to deal with possible renovation works by neighbour renting out their units to different people.

Another thing that is very impt is neighbour. Might not be so obvious as u think neighbour can change.... in my estate, both my in-laws place and my place, our closest 4 neighbours has not changed in the past 10 years ever since I moved in.
 
I did not checked out my 2 next door neighbour before buying but they turned out to be the quiet sort. No teenage kids, no parties, small family. No parking quarrels. To be frank another part of countryside has a neighbour quarrel that went on newspaper many years back....

nothing beat having good neighbours.
 
if a unit is going very cheap make sure its not selling due to bad neighbours lol

wah how old are you??? 
 
I agree that if you are planning to redo, a lot of things listed by therock can ignore.
 
That is what I did, so much easier to get a unit you like.
 
Most important things to consider are actually outside the house where you cannot change.... like neighbors, location, noise, etc.
 
The place also cannot be too run down as you want your surroundings to be nice right? Quite important actually as you take walks around your neighborhood very often

location-map-of-nsc-tunnel-between-ang-mo-kio-avenue-9-and-sungei-seletar.png
 
NSC is along Lentor Avenue, just beside Countryside...

 
 
well noted

 
Aren't you happy you found this out. I am quite surprised that you did not know it beforehand if you are considering countryside. Lucky my unit is one of the furthest unit from the NSC.
 
So another big no no is DON'T buy any unit near the main road. U never know when government want to build something over it.

I have reached a stage that age is just a number. Stay happy and healthy is the key.
 
Certain things you must do before you move in for landed property.  Roof, wiring,  plumbing, floors,  etc. Avoid locations you have very little control over your neighbours. Eg are the change of use (place of worship), proximity to activites causing congestion to parking, renting to workers as dormitories/store, etc
 
Pick one that is within more private residential area.

nothing beat having good neighbours.
 
if a unit is going very cheap make sure its not selling due to bad neighbours lol
Agree. Neighbours are Very very important So far my left,  right, front , back are all very friendly. But to certain extent, it depends on ourselves too. If we are friendly to others, accomodating,  we will get the same reciprocal. Of course there are exceptions just like there are axx hxlx drivers on the road as well, then luck becomes a factor.

The original plan see below used to be semi-tunnel, ie sunken and the top is exposed. But I think a lot of people make noise and maybe they revised the plan. 
 
https://www.lta.gov.sg/data/apps/news/press/2011/NSErampsrev2-1.pdf
 
Anyway I don't think the semi tunnel will be noise as it is sunken. Noise need a direct line of of sight. That is why some units higher up is more noise as they have a direct line of sight to the road while lower units are blocked. 
 
Air pollution is more of an issue.

you mean New South Corridor? No lar, my partner and me built a few landed houses on our own over the years. We built as an owner to avoid all the developer restriction like ABSD and tax. This is will be our last project as the efforts and profit margin is not so worth it any more. Cost is really a night mare compare to the past. BCA has come out with so many rules and regulations that every new ruling means more $$. 
Is there some rules that restrict this? I saw many launches being shared in MCF leh. Good lobang share lah. Many potentially buyers here.
 
Boh lobang lar.. unless you want to buy my last few units? 1 completed and 3 terraces WIP near Charlton where I used to stay.

Not sure how big the impact is on Bullion Park. I think Bullion Park is nice. 
 
I always tell people to buy Bullion park but not many units for sale when we were looking. In the end I build my house as at that time, landed seems cheaper than big condo unit.

I viewed a few units last year at bullion park but all facing expressway. Maybe that is why they are selling, before the construction starts. Will be hard to rent out for those years of construction.

I also think Lentor is also more centrally located than cashew I think. My wife works in the west, I work in the east. We both changed jobs after we moved into lentor, my wife changed from changi to one north. I changed from central to East side.  
 
No matter where you work in Singapore, the commute isn't really long. 
 
Plus the new NSC and Thomson line, I think the west side is just getting more crowded with no infrastructure upgrade.

Queenstown MRT - 1800 psf and up definitely not budget area
Pasir Panjang MRT 
Paya Lebar MRT
Kallang MRT
Bishan MRT - some small units in the 2 mil plus region
Macpherson MRT - small units
Lavender MRT - old shop house style
Novena MRT - not cheap

Even if you pay for a “nice” area, there are also good and lousy units. 
Facing, neighbors, smells etc all matter. 
 
One thing if you can help it:
How much is your frontage - remember there’s a 7m setback if you tear down. So if you have a house with a long driveway and land you have a higher chance of getting a nice renovation and resale value. 
Your 1616 place probably has a v short driveway. 
See Chelsea village for example, 12m long driveways. You can almost put a lap pool. 
If you have 4.5mil the Barker Road area had a 1616 unit for sale previously. Move in condition and 1km to ACS. Classy four storey with basement. Almost 4000 built in. Pipe in gas too and under 10 years old. 
Can look see for ideas on renovations. 
MT Sinai area
There was a corner terrace facing greenery. 2800 land asking 5mil. 1km to Henry park. Superb location but hey it’s the peanuts and monkey principle..
There are some divorce sales. Prices can be good but paperwork can be messy.

Good advice. Just see more to know more. Even out of budget ones just to get a feel and ideas. But sometimes if see too much you get also buying fatigue. And then you might get frustrated and then just settle, especially in a rising price market.

Just like those threads soliciting opinions on cars.. one can go from Elantra to C class in a jiffy..Besides, investing in property is a far wiser proposition;)
And you can see what a few more dollars buys. 
Sometimes scrimping too low can lead to compromises that you regret. 
And reality bites. Say one is barely able to squeeze 2 mil together and can’t afford renovations etc it’s better not to push so hard. 
You need 4mil in the war chest. In case of emergency and for other costs.
Btw don’t pay 3mil for someone’s ten year old renovation that the owner put a higher than realistic valuation on. Better to buy really old. Pay for the land. 
Someone’s idea of style could be your idea of a dump.

This is 100% my personal view and speaking from experience. If you are particular about parking, and own multiple cars, do visit your intended home late in the night to gauge parking situation.
 
These days with high-cost of houses and multi-generational homes, there is high chance that many landed homes will have more than 1 car. Some houses may even have 3 or more cars, and none parked within their compound. Where I am leading too is cars parked along both sides of a narrow road in an estate. Sometimes directly opposite your gate so getting car out is an issue. Whenever I visit friends at Braddell, Serangoon, West Coast and Pavilion, I have to squeeze through careful not to hit car mirrors on both sides. When I finally do find parking, it is a half lot. I even parked at rubbish sites, sub-station gates, at corners. It is the norm in those estates in the night. Best part is that there is a white line but as parking is a problem for all the residents, they just live and let live till morning comes.      
 
I used to live in landed except for the last 10 years. For a few reasons, I have chosen to live in a condo nowadays. No regrets at this stage in my life. One of the main reasons that made me move out of my landed was that the parking went from bad to worse. My home had 2 cars. Both me and wife will park in driveway. Trouble was my neighbours chose to park their multiple cars outside, along a small road, in order to maximize their porch space for other activities. They parked illegally and indiscriminately opposite by gate. Directly outside my gate is white line, hydrant and  a corner. Reversing in and out became a constant challenge with many near misses and minor accidents like scratched doors and bumpers. Worst case was I unintentionally hit my neighbours car door while reversing in tight space, and it caved in. He never asked for compensation knowing he was in the wrong, but I felt bad about it.    
To some, the tight parking and inevitable scratches and dents is a non-issue. To me, as one who washes and polishes my own car, it was. Hence happiness to live in a condo where there is sufficient and considerate parking.
 
Be aware that even if parking is now not an issue, it may be within months if the present 1 car neighbour changes to one with 4 cars and a lorry. And they choose to park most of the vehicles outside their gate.

Pic from Google. Lentor countryside. One loooong road with no units opening into it. No parking issue if u live near there. 
I do hate manuvering out of a crowded road, that is why we chose our current place. No parking issues, less chance of quarrels.

It’s maxed out? It is a very old development with open air carparks. I thought they can build many more units.

Well you have to pay $$ for that bro.. or get something so old you are only buying land. The newer ones quote PSF, that's for built up not land..
That's why it's 1700 psf if you calculate based on the land size.. 
 
BTW if you are doing a rebuild, make sure you work with your builder and neighbours. A small road - like the Countryside one, yes that 'wide' road, may not be able to take a full truck or a cement mixer coming in. And with such a long road, you need to coordinate with the entire road of owners, so they clear the road such that the truck can come in. Trust me, it's not a given nor an easy task. If a car gets scratched... be prepared for an ugly scene.
So also check that your con is registered and has insurance. One of your neighbours might own a limited Maclaren that your builder just happens to nick whilst transporting your tiles into your plot... 
 
I'm not trying to start a 'width' war... but take a long at Mt Sinai Drive for example... it's practically a four lane road.. vs lanes in Telok Kurau, where a car can barely squeeze past if someone double parks...
So yes those newer Lanes in Lentor may allow cars to pass but there are wider roads and as usual, YMMV.
Peace out.
 
 
Exactly what I feel bro.. 
Take Telok Kurau again. there are many disputes and angry neighbours there as a result of the new condos sharing the same exit point as the houses.
 
Take Frankel Ave, now that's a wide road. Even when you park on the sides, there's enough space. Don't take it for grant. View that place at various times of the day, check out the streets next to eat, and as others have said, if there are eateries around it, will there be a lot of illegal parking.

Good point..
There are two places I will avoid.. the last few lanes along Old Upper Thomson Road and Hindhede Road.
These two places are plagued by monkeys. And each generation is more emboldened than the older..

Which three units in Lentor? I like president gardens the best, where my in law stayed. Itâs the first development but no units for sale at that time. 
 
The Lentor mrt site has plans for shops under ura masterplan. So choose accordingly, too close might have parking issues
2 at Lentor Plain 1 countryside 
 
Viewed 1 at Lentor grove weeks ago
 
President garden is the one nearest to Lentor MRT?

Actually which area are you looking at? Lentor cashew and pasir panjang is all over the place. Or your only criteria is landed within 3M. And see whichever area in Singapore best fits.

Lentor plain is banyan villa. When I bought 10 years ago, they were relatively new and still commanded a price premium. I chose a older unit as I was planning to renovate.

Chelsea Village has nice long driveways, walking distance to MRT and it’s far enough from the main road. There’s a playground somewhere there too.

Jambol is very narrow.. and parking is tight. Nightmare for builders.
But Chelsea is a wide road. Everyone there parks on both sides in the cul de sac. If you buy along the entry road it’s a single white line. 
So that’s why even within an estate there are good and bad locations. 
Just like the lentor area. 
The area closer to the train station is older and has wider roads. But that’s a main thoroughfare and not so safe for kids to play along the road.

If one is doing an extended renovation or teardown do make friends with your neighbors and leave a contact for them. 
Making them feel you care about their welfare prevents nasty complaints. They will send feedback to your builder or you instead of the NEA. Once it’s official it will be worse for you.

exactly. I think the immediate situation is much more important. Take countryside for example, there are parking issues that escalated to lawsuits at certain area while other area has plenty of parking. 
 
Some locations has stuff like cul du sacs, or like countryside where they dont terminate the road but built another connecting road for exit. That connecting road has zero houses on both sides so it acts as free parking while providing an alternative exit path. I can get on of my house either turning left or right. 
 
Therefore I don't think wider roads are good actually as wider roads are usually main exit/entry roads... I much prefer quieter and narrower roads as long as can double park and let one car through. Some roads can't even double park...
 
Single white line is usually an alarm bell though... most roads are dotted line unless got people complain until LTA draw single solid white line...

Ya Lor... sigh... but parking is one of the biggest issues actually. Our thread has already one guy who moved out of his landed because of parking.
 
Itâs no joke trying to get in out of your house Everyday if the road is double parked all the time... my immediate neighbour has 4 cars but only one space in driveway. Lucky he is corner terrace and beside him is the connecting road so he Parks his three cars there without disturbing any people.
countryside lanes are already wider than other Lentor lanes. 
Countryside transacted deals are almost the same price psf in the past 2-3 years, ie. 1.1-1.2k psf for 2000 land and 1k psf for 2800/3500 land

Got lots of selfish people around. For Some the porch is the play area for the grandkids. No cars in the house. All the 3-4 cars all parked outside even though the house can take 3 cars.

Not really true about the pool. Maintenance cost is not cheap. And if it’s not long enough, it’s a fish pond.

For landed, the utmost priority for me are the neighbors. A cb neighbor can ruin everything. 
 
For condo and hdb at least there is still management and town council to do something.
 
We had a neighbor at my parents place that was nice to everyone in the estate but was super aggressive when someone living in the condo nearby told his drivers to park all the PA plate mini bus along our street to save on parking. It was 5-6 vans. We got fed up and this neighbor had a few vans and car from his business and he blocked the vans from moving out by parking very close to them. Left his cars for a few days until the owner of the mini bus had to call the police. 
 
We then explained to the police that we are neighborly here and park close to each other to maximize space and that if anyone of us needed to move out it was a quick phone call away. 
 
The mini bus owner continued to park and the neighbor continued to block him until he could no longer take it and finally moved his mini buses away.

Bad neighbour are everywhere no matter what type of houses you stay. Even though there are management and town council in condo and hdb, but there is also very little that they can do for bad neighbour la. Maybe there is no law on dealing with bad neighbour, so these people would not scare of anyone de.

Maybe he wanted to use a gas dryer and gas water heaters.

I seldom see people swimming in their home pools. Usually it's too small or too cold (especially those at the side not heated up by the sun). It does add to the ambience though.
 
For lifts, only if you have/are old folks with leg problems. Can always leave a space during reno for lift later when can no longer climb stairs.

Still on landed home parking woes. I have 2 friends whose homes are very close to HDB. One in Hougang and the other at West Coast Road. 
 
Both sites, residents wrote in to URA to implement paid parking along the road. Even the residents wanted to pay season parking to park on their own street. Why?
 
Because cars from the HDB side spilled over and parked indiscriminately. Worse still, heavy vehicles parked there overnight in an inconsiderate manner as the drivers lived nearby and looked for convenient overnight parking. 
 
We all know that once a big truck parks opposite your gate. You can't get out. Even if hit them while reversing, the truck wont feel a thing while our bumper or boot gets the dents.  
 
Moral of story : All is not good with parking in landed houses except in GCB area.

This is very personal. For me, I don’t want a pool due to maintenance issue and it’s too small to swim. I can’t afford huge pools.... 
In fact, a pool is a negative ie worse than no pool as there is maintenance fees. I rather swim at my condo pool.
 
Same for lift. I don’t need lift... I hope, for the next 20 years...

The last statement is wrong. There are some places with no parking issues other than gcb. U just have to look for them. 
Other than the earlier examples from me and rock, older estates with Long driveway tends to have less issues. Not just because the driveways, because the owners like my in laws bought the place 30 years ago. They are not rich, so either no car or 1 car. Newer developments that cost millions tend to attract families with multiple cars

Not really true about the pool. Maintenance cost is not cheap. And if it’s not long enough, it’s a fish pond.
 
Yes there's maintenance, but you can manage it yourself, really. Unless you have an Olympic sized pool.
Length? No issue
Look up "counter current".... even Olympic athletes use it

Neighbours play a role, but you can shut them out.
Of course if they are really scum, that's hard..

I think there's less conflict as there's only left and right, no up and down or even idiots who burn or scratch cars..
sure there are also psychos, but they are the exception

The last statement is wrong. There are some places with no parking issues other than gcb. U just have to look for them.
 
Other than the earlier examples from me and rock, older estates with Long driveway tends to have less issues. Not just because the driveways, because the owners like my in laws bought the place 30 years ago. They are not rich, so either no car or 1 car. Newer developments that cost millions tend to attract families with multiple cars

+1
This parking thing is over-stressed.
More than 90% of neighbours are ok. This statement may not PC but most people just want to live quiet private lives (not that those elsewhere don't). 
They also know if you start a conflict, it doesn't end well. Especially in terrace houses, where you have to see your next door daily, you tend to work things out.
 
That's why talking, having a house party, doing interactive things is always better than erecting barriers, fences and brick walls. And many have lived together for years and have understood each other's quirks.
In my old home, my dad asked my neighbour who was this huge tattooed chap to keep his music down as I was taking my exams, and he obliged readily.
 
We gave his some of our guavas and we wave at each other daily.
 
My other neighbour collected newspapers for us when we go overseas. Everyone in the street came when my dad passed.

You are right. There are less landed enclaves with no parking woes for now. I am in one now, albeit my high rise is nestled among the bigger landed in Holland Road vicinity. Most of landed house residents park inside as have space for 5 cars. The road side parking is taken up by condo dwellers whose third cars are forced to park outside.
 
Long driveway homes are a double-edged sword. Have to check URA the zoning laws and hope they do not change. My first house 30 years ago was in an area populated by bungalows and long driveways when I bought. Subsequently, zoning changed to allow 4 storey condos to be built in place of terrace and bungalows. The owners sold out as price soared overnight. From a home with like you say, one or two cars parked inside, became a condo with 60 cars. The access road could not be widened, and cars from the condo spilled onto the other small roads around the condo. 
 
In the end its do your homework and caveat emptor

Remember, what money can solve, it's a good thing, so have your cash stash before you begin your project.
One house with one or two cars is reasonable, the issue starts when one house has more than two cars and park wherever they like inconsiderably

Just throwing this question out...
 
Price wise aside, do you guys prefer a landed house with a pool or a lift or both over those with either? Any why so for your preference?
 
TIA for your insights...

My bad. Should have been more specific...
 
Dip pool that is. Not sizeable ones...

Both lifts and pools require some maintenance. 
A pool can cost upwards of 50k, and a lift twice that. 
As for maintenance, the lift costs 7k up a year, and the pool about half that. YMMV.
If you have kids, or you like swimming, it's a big plus. If you did it for showoff reason, or merely to 'increase value' it can become a white elephant. To each his own...
 
But anyway, not everyone can make one, especially in an intermediate terrace. 
 
There can be a whole thread on pools, type, pro and cons etc... but the question is whether TS is going to consider one - this is like add a spoiler... get the car first and talk about this later...
 
You need a minimum of 10m, or it will be a fancy koi pond.

My uncle added a lap pool at the side of his semiD, used maybe for a year and then it’s now a water feature for the last 15years. 5kids in the family, but hardly used.

I donât prefer 3 storey after yesterday viewing, getting old...
Please share LTA reply ðð¼
You may want to consider more than 2 storey, you can leave your third floor unused but at least it helps to shield the heat from the roof so that your 2nd floor can be more cooling in the day.Very true, I tiled my first terrace house small garden too, but now getting much older would prefer a small well manicured garden space.My small garden quite messy, I have no green fingers, even grass also difficult to survive.

Lentor has 9 playgrounds/Parks. Never understood why there is so many but makes the surroundings less built up, nice to jog.
 
Used to have some very nice old trees and the government chopped all of them down after the death of someone due to falling tree a few years back. So sad.

Still hotter than the floor below.This is precisely what I mean. So i leave my top floor empty currently and use only three floor and below. Top floor only for chill out at night when my friends drop by. Day time still not a big issue if I want to use it as I have a dedicated compressor to drive the entire floor.

For existing house with this problem, the cheapest solution is to install exhaust/extractor fans either in the ceiling (if pitched roof) or wall (as high as possible) if you don't want to tear up the roof.  Should be only a few hundred to install.  Just put them to run on timer, will only be a few dollars of electricity a month but the effect is very good.

Some roof has a small chimney like thing to let the hot air out, not mechanical though but should be good enough as hot air rises. 
 
For me, the hot room is the one with direct afternoon sun, not the highest.

More in the old old 1960-1980 which were never rebuilt. Part of the pipes were exposed or close to the surface on the ground floor.  
The older designs had the toilets at the back of the building and water and sewage pipes were exposed on the back wall.

This should be a non-issue, with Induction cooking picking up. Some hesitancy due to the myths of not being able to do heavy cooking, etc.

Got lots of selfish people around. For Some the porch is the play area for the grandkids. No cars in the house. All the 3-4 cars all parked outside even though the house can take 3 cars.
Not really true about the pool. Maintenance cost is not cheap. And if it’s not long enough, it’s a fish pond.

Yah, I saw some of the neighbours use the rubbish dumps to "chope" for years. Does not affects me as I have more than enough parking space for my car and 3 motor bikes.
 
For pool maintenance, it costs about $200 per month if you get a contractor.
 
For me I DIY and train my helper to do some part of it. Get a robotic vacuum for about 1.3k. Weekly adding chlorine and flushing the filter is a must. Clear the leafs once a while and thats all. Good exercise too. For chorine, please make sure you only buy Japanese brand. Those other brand I bought from Lazada are really useless.
 
Actually, i am not really a keen swimmer. Just like to dip into water on a hot day plus a few cans of beer etc. Beside the pool give u a lot of relaxation especially at night when you turn on the pool light.
 
I give my helper $50 per month extra and I save $150. Not a bad deal.
Industrial ventilators might be unsightly and noisy for house. And yes, think of the mess of doing alteration/reno will feel tiring once settled in.
 
No noise at all. In all my projects, i always have it whenever possible. 
I always put ventilation and air circulation as the top priority.

In my old place, the side of the house is part tiles and part garden.. The grass did not grow well despite all the efforts put in.. In then end just plant some hardly plants. While those part that are tiles, it because very hot during the day as heat rises. And the tiled area becomes a place where it is used to store a lot of things. Become very unsightly. So decide to build a pool this time, hoping it will cool down the place. 
 
Yes, i got a lot of children too.. but only me and my youngest use it.

yes agreed. My wife used to think like that too. We have a wet kitchen and uses tank gas. Wet kitchen is located at the back yard and the wind is so strong that it takes longer time to cook and waste a lot of $ as tank dries up quickly. I then introduced induction hob to my wife and we never look back. Beside it does not seem to take up a lot of electricity.
 
We have been using it for the last 10+years and  induction hob looks quite nice.

Yes it will cool down. But note that if it’s too much in the shade you need to clean the side often as it is now more moist and algae will grow.  
Could I suggest you try out swimming in a small pool. Feeling it very different. This is one reason why uncle kids don’t use it.  For me a pool needs to be closer to 20m long. Else too short to have a proper swim.

.

My rubbish bin chope for 10 years already. Both me and my next door neighbour chope that spot with our rubbish dump. We both have 1 car which we park inside. 
 
So we don’t want people to park there as our opposite neighbour Parks outside as he has 2 cars. If people park on our side, become double park and is very hard to turn out.

Kind of scraping the idea of buying Cashew area for now as the price psf is relatively more expensive by 2-30% compared to Lentor and Pasir Pajang.
 
Lentor and Pasir Pajang are about the same price psf, unbelievable consider Pasir Pajang is so near to Central/CBD

PP is a bit of a blind spot. 
Unless you commute to AMK area then it’s quite a long way off. 
But choose well. Get your agent to shortlist. 
So have you found the plans for the area by URA?

I think Pasir Panjang has higher upside. 
I think previously it’s price is Low because honestly that place is not nice to live. Near port with all the pollution, Pasir Panjang mrt is pretty useless as it stops at Vivo....  so many changes needed to get somewhere. 
 
But all these might change in 10 years....
 
Actually, the Pasir Panjang move is a bit more tricky.... 2040 and dependent on how Tuas turn out. Malaysia can always cause us problems. I suspect government might want to keep Pasir Panjang as a backup.

PP is tricky. 
Too near main road and it’s noisy and potentially dusty. 
Too far from the trains, or narrow lanes can spoil your stay. 
So be smart and look around. Use your own checklist and see what suits you. 
The area near Thomson plaza is nice too and so is the Windsor park area. 
Jalan Peminpin is another good area. But price ...

On the bright side, my Wife take cte every morning and the traffic is pretty good on most days, 730-800 after dropping of our kids. 
 
$80 a month, around 1k a year. To me the cost is not significant. I rather pay this than get stuck in traffic. I am surprised they build the nsc because the cte traffic is pretty ok from my experience.

Many other gantries don’t even start before 8am.just saying that the traffic conditions got to be the worst on CTE since the rates are the highest and length of operation longest.

U know a lot of landed enclaves. So where you got in the end??
 
Nice place is always more ex. One can always buy a bigger place in more ulu locations. 
 
To me it’s about commute time. The time to drive from Yio Chu Kang entrance to let’s say amk ave 1 entrance is 5 mins on average. I think getting to the expressway entrance takes more time. Example, mimosa park is ulu but it literally takes only few minutes to get to cte as no traffic lights. Compare to some places closer to city but takes longer or same to drive...
 
Same for mrt. Bishan mrt and yck mrt is 2 stops 6 minutes apart. How much is that worth to you?i think getting to the mrt time is probably a bigger consideration.

YCK was bad for me.. be it CTE or Upper Thomson, it was bad after 7.30 am..
Even 30 years ago, it took me 90min or more to get to school.

you said "was" so I assume it was long ago.... 30 years ago no ERP what.
 
This kind of thing no need to argue one.
 
I can measure for you everyday around 730am as we drop of our kid at 720ish everyday then take CTE. It is not clear traffic but not Jam. As MKL22 pointed out, LTA monitor CTE very closely, adjusts the ERP rates often.

Ya, if you are comparing traffic IF there was no ERP, I guess CTE got to be the worst among all the major expressways as their rates are the highest. 
 
but I only care about real life traffic with ERP.... like I said, I am thankful that ERP on CTE has brought the traffic to a pretty ok condition and LTA monitor it very closely.  
 
There was a time (2 years ago?) TPE towards SLE traffic was very bad after work before they fixed the TPE/SLE/CTE interchange. No ERP but almost jam everyday.... I wish there was some ERP during that time. 
 
If you drive, I am sure you know that some arterial roads are much worse than the expressway as LTA don't monitor them or put ERP on them. Plus traffic lights, sometimes getting to the expressway takes much longer, ie from my kid school to expressway or my wife's work place before they added in a separate entry road.

That PP unit I viewed is minutes walking distance from MRT but yes, too heavy traffic, hence air and noise pollution  
Thomson Plaza area mostly small units with narrow lanes.
 
 
30 years ago, Spore where got so many cars

I'm piqued, I know the area well, but I don't see anything on Prop Guru which is on Pasir Panjang Road that's mins walk to the MRT AND within 3mil..
But if you can't stand the noise and dust, you know what to do.
Buying a home is more similar to finding a good wife than you think..
 
If you 'put up' with certain aspects hoping things will get better with time, well, as you know, it doesn't..  
 
But be prepared to pay more and whatever prices you saw last year.. forget it, it's about 10-20% more now. Those who don't get their selling price will hold, because those in landed tend to have that hold power, unless they lose their jobs. And some are already retired and have no fear of not selling..

So my guess a few post earlier was correct that you may have difficulties finding what you want if you limit yourself to only two locations  You may want to try even more areas than you are eyeing now , you may change your view and liking of certain location. No harm viewing more as long as you have the energy and time. Be prepared for a long hunting cycle like even up to more than a year. Looking for landed is never easy.

Yeah, I didnât know Spore has so many landed properties spread around the island before surveyingYah keep going.  Macpherson, happy Avenue, sennett estate, serangoon(most crowded with landed), Kovan etc etc. And skip bukit timah because your budget isonly 3mil, it is why I cannot afford to stay there too.And remember, buyer stamp duty is 3%, so a 3mil house meaning have to "hoot" another close to $100k of stamp duty fee.
 And reno, assuming if you have budgeted 250k for reno, you need to be very tight with your spend, or else you will likely blow your reno budget too.

Good landed house should sit in an estate which is low density, with wider roads and without any eating establishments and very low penetration of anything remotely highrise.
 
Traffic should be low and walking distance to amenities is a plus
Anything along a main road is simply a no no.
Anything within a semi industrial estate a no no
 
It should preferably be within 10-15km from the heart of the city and be easily accessible to the highways. 
 
Thats requirements for the vicinity only.
 
Requirements for site would be another set of requirements

Otherwise stay landed but hear the buses and cars pass by every other 2 mins, for what?
Stay in landed but every other “outsider” come and park left right up down In front your house for what?
Stay landed but choked up by the surrounding high rise, for what?
Stay landed but have people walk pass your house every min of the day, for what?
Stay landed but want to go to town have to drive 25km, for what?
Stay landed but everyday see big trucks and lorries, for what?
Stay landed but everyday drive into thick traffic going in and coming out for what?
 
 
As i did say one man’s meat is another man’s poison when it comes to landed houses here.
 
Therefore be very selective about a landed house and its vicinity.
Several areas are no no, unless you can truly find a perfect spot within.
 
I shall not mention where becos people always get offended.
But do be very very discerning when buying a landed house to stay.
 
Did you recently buy on Bro?
Or you bought quite long back?

I totally agree broI think all of us have shared as much as we can. 
Is it possible to get all these at the 3 mil mark ?
 
Yes but TS needs to do his own homework. No one is an agent here but will everyone simply share the best deal here? Maybe they will buy it for themselves already. 
 
I think I’ve done what I can and I’m certainly not looking to be paid. But without recce and A LOT of it - one year is not long, you may not find that unit. 
Especially this late after prices have increased. Move in condition for 3m? LH maybe..
But as I suspected, like the car threads, TS has more ammo and can go higher. Otherwise he won’t venture into B Timah la

Actually if you look hard almost every area has quiet spots and similarly there are some bad units. No special tips needed. The agent curated what he feels suits the buyer. That’s why the buyer and agent must feel good about each other. Imagine you tell him you have 3m and then reject all his suggestions and look at the criteria which only 5m ones can meet.. hard for them to help. 
 
Since I drive around PP often due to work, and my old haunt was YCK, I can say, I can’t think of any current unit which is 3m and under which is move in condition and quiet and near MRT and near amenities and FH and has a wide road :)
But agents can dig up units or just drop letters for you. 
 
Two years ago, maybe.. even in Holland areas. Heck, in 2007 a new semi d along Holland road was 1.65m. But unless we have the time stone, that’s moot ... cheers and I do wish TS success in his search.

Agree with you, not easy but can find but very difficult to find one. I went through the same 2 years ago and now no look back. At one point I  nearly gave up but fortunately I found what I have  wanted. Quite Cal de sac , walking distance to mrt, quiet yet near amenities, not near road side yet very accessible, no  direct west sun, sufficient parking space outside the gate and around the small neighborhood.

Actually, your criteria is not that hard to fulfill, except the walking distance to amenities and low traffic thing is pretty contradictory. So your walking distance must be quite a distance.
 
10-15km actually covers a lot. Lentor driving distance to City hallis 14.9km.. Just fit criteria, heng ah.

A bit true, but some neighbours dont really come and go, they stay there ''forever''. Esp bad neighbours.    House in a lousy spot, actually this can be avoided. Cause it is the choice of the buyer to buy that house lo, buyer should be aware of the lousy spot, can dont buy de. However for bad neighbours, you never able get to know until you have move into your house.

which estate? share lah. I think the most important thing is you are happy with the place and am willing to grow old in it. 
 
If you think about it, if the place is really good, usually people will not sell as they just grow old in it unless owner die or children leave the house. Even if children leave, my in laws still stay at their place as they super comfortable in it. 
 
that is why not easy to get good location landed. Condo the churn rate is much higher.

Is it possible to get all these at the 3 mil mark ?
 
Yes but TS needs to do his own homework. No one is an agent here but will everyone simply share the best deal here? Maybe they will buy it for themselves already.
 
I think I’ve done what I can and I’m certainly not looking to be paid. But without recce and A LOT of it - one year is not long, you may not find that unit.
Especially this late after prices have increased. Move in condition for 3m? LH maybe..
But as I suspected, like the car threads, TS has more ammo and can go higher. Otherwise he won’t venture into B Timah la
 
;)

 
Luxus hills > 3mio and move in condition can get.
Springside also have, but also > 3mio I think.

A bit true, but some neighbours dont really come and go, they stay there ''forever''. Esp bad neighbours.    House in a lousy spot, actually this can be avoided. Cause it is the choice of the buyer to buy that house lo, buyer should be aware of the lousy spot, can dont buy de. However for bad neighbours, you never able get to know until you have move into your house.  

I wonder even before there is MRT in toh tuck area, that area already quite ex, dont know why?!

 
Because this district has got very few Landed compare to say D19/D28/D26. Also plus point is, it is just outside Bukit Timah.. So when people ask where do you stay, they always say Upper Bukit Timah (sounds good mah). There is a project dear Toh Tuck (kismis something), the inter is asking for about 4 mio liao if I recall correctly. Scary..
 
So if you really need to stay in Toh Tuck area like Lala81's friend, really have to pay a premium. As I work in town, i think this area is much further than D19 Kovan area. So I chose Kovan during that time, but would have make even more money had I chosen Toh Tuck. Demand and Supply

many factors can be confusing - i share my thoughts :-)
 
Know budget limits
aim decided areas - work, school, parents etc
 
Then decide on deal breakers- for me, house must be:
1) quiet, no t junction
2) must park 1 car outside easily
3) walk to mrt - i accept up to 550m
 
And best around 1800 sq feet (too small not nice) and corner terrace at least (not deal breaker though)
 
means i am willing to accept - very poor condition of house. 
 
Don't have- just wait for right one. Otherwise - better off in hdb/condo. 
 
as you earn, you have money for home improvement - but buy wrong location now - more ex as sale not easy, harder to rent out and buy in may be higher down the road.

when we say walking distance to MRT, how to definate that distance? 250m, 500m or 850m?
 

For me walking distance should be less than 7 mins. Anything more consider is far but some people would still find if can walk to MRT in less than 15 mins is consider walking distance to MRT.

Because this district has got very few Landed compare to say D19/D28/D26. Also plus point is, it is just outside Bukit Timah.. So when people ask where do you stay, they always say Upper Bukit Timah (sounds good mah).

Must see which part of town you are going, with the MRT in Toh Tuck area, going to town also quite near. Anyway, whether private or hdb, the whole toh tuck/toh yi area are ex.

Depends, market rate about 250 to 300 for moderate materials. Mine is $270 excluding cabinetry, but with lift, no pool. My built up will be 4950 sf
 
$270 sounds about right. My first house I built for own stay is like only $190 psf and that was like 2006 or 2007. 
Reason for the escalating cost are fees and fees, levies, labours. Actually, material went up not as much as compare to labours/fees etc.
 
For eg, lift price has drop quite a bit compare to the past. Marble price seems to be cheaper than in 2007 period. Sand, Concrete and steel though have increase, is not as scary.
 
Another factor is piling. In the past, Piling requirement are not so stringent. Now it is like almost every project u need piling and when got piling, need this engineer and that engineer. All $$$, so heartache. Piling is like about >$100k and that does not include engineering fees.
 
Partly all the fees we are paying is because people like to complaint to BCA and scold BCA why never do this and that and must ensure this and that. So for every complaint, a new requirement comes in. To BCA, they are just gathering the feedback and doing their job mah. At the end of the road, who bares the cost? So next time want to complaint better think twice.

Actually, your criteria is not that hard to fulfill, except the walking distance to amenities and low traffic thing is pretty contradictory. So your walking distance must be quite a distance.
 
10-15km actually covers a lot. Lentor driving distance to City hallis 14.9km.. Just fit criteria, heng ah.
My walking distance means within 7 mins, max max 10minsLow traffic means basically my kids can play on the road in front of my house and i dont queue up more than 2mins to drive in or drive out of my estate.t
 
I am about 10km from city center.
Takes me 15-20 min max to drive to orchard road during normal office hours
Lentor is already a bit off for me.
But it has its charm too

Toh Tuch area is very ex. You pay for a Inter Terrace price in Toh Tuck, you almost can get a corner and pay a bit more, can get a semi-D in D19/D28. I know i used to have projects in all the district. Now winding down liao.
 
toh tuck is a long road. close to Jurong kechil or close to the bukit batok side, makes a diff to amenities.

 NOt contradictory
 
It is highly dependant on how an estate is connected
 
For example inside Serangoon Gardens
To me it is horrible.
Go in and out takes a long time
If you stay at the good part of the estate, you are dar away from everythibg
Walk time too far
Drive too short and poor parking
 
But just outside Serangoon Gardens for example alnwick road, its not too bad. 
Thats just example, 
 
My place is definitely much better hands down.

Traffic in an area is very important, some places even though the distance from the area to city centre is short, but the time taken to travel takes up a long time. Example in balestier area, distance to city centre is less than 10km, but the drive could take at least 20-30 mins during the peak hours to drive from city centre back to balestier.

Don't forgot bro..
It's move in, plus near MRT, good amenities, and near CBD... And under 3mil... 
I'm not able to see any on the market right now.

And the road noise there doesn’t stop till past midnight. 
The area nearer the Little India is quieter but if you get closer to the Farrer hospital it gets messier and closer to the Jalan Besar area it gets “exotic”

I find no matter which part of balestier rd you are on still cannot escape the heavy traffic in that area. Even you stay near the quality hotel marlow which is the starting point of balestier, but the heavy and slow traffic starting from lavender st can kills if you come from that direction during the peak.

Very messy, like geylang.
 
For condo, high in the air with own big compound still not so bad.

dpends on how one classifies balestier road. on  the side to novena, some might say it novena, but for the side that is between PIE and Balestier road itself, there is the portion where it is tough to escape the jams. but anyway. hardly any landed there.

bottomline is it tough to find a steal in the current market.
 
what about cambridge road area. rather messy, but i think prices are lower there as well. i think it is the closest to the city without paying city prices if you get what i mean.

From the Ad , it sounds good as they push all the positives.
But if it is in between kovan and serangoon means it is neither here nor there.
Probably this is around lorong lew lian?
Just guessing.
 
Price is good for move in and build up size so there must be a catch somewhere.
Maybe by the roadside
Maybe beside temple
Maybe maybe maybe

My sis lives near golden walk or something, near Lor Chuan MRT. 
 
Actually, if one is looking for big and cheap place, we were thinking last year if we should change to a semi-D at Tung-po avenue. In the end, we decided better to buy something else for rental rather than staying in a bigger place....

have to accept things differently if one wants sort of a bargain. not only landed but condo prices are all sort of equalizing. its a threshold that one needs to overcome. at 4M the options open up a lot.
 no different to buying cars. just that "little bit more" you get more.

If 99yr leasehold is not an issue, there are many options below $3mio.
 
Holland Grove semi-d with 23 years of lease used up can be had for close to $3mio. This ticks all the boxes.
 
Behind the Rail Mall, the landed there is priced below $1 mio. Because land lease left only 28 years.

Adding to Throttle2's criteria for good landed.
 
- should not be too close to places of worship or popular restaurants
 
Get illegal parking on Fridays, Sundays, Chinese festivals, Buddhist festivals, Indian festivals or at night. Besides, will also get free prayer sounds, worship singing/chanting, burning incense smells and cooking smells.

actually I am not sure why people say the price is rising. I was in the market for a resale condo 2018 Oct and the market was definitely falling and it was a buyers market. No way I would have bought if the price is not lower than the last transacted.Comparing to 2007, sure up liao mah

As mentioned in the topic title, which place is the better choice in term of:
 
1. Privilege 
2. Capital appreciation 
3. Accessibility
I have stayed in HDB near Lentor and Kovan, now like T2, I am staying at Punggol Field.   
Kovan is the better of the 2 due to promity to MRT, many many F&B outlets/ food market and it is a short drive to KPE via Tampines Road (agree traffic is bad during peak hours on Upp Serangoon Road) but finding a good landed with a layout you like is time consuming as it is an older estate with very few uniform developments but there are very good ones out there.  The last house hunt took us more than 9 months.  Parking is usually bad.
 
Lentor is very quiet and spaced out and kids can run free outside as it is a "cul de sac" estate but if you drive to work, CTE is expensive and a bloody pain during peak hours, the new expressway should help.  Some landed in Kovan can walk to MRT/ Kovan food market but Lentor is a little far to walk in SG weather (I never once walk to the 628 market) but the new MRT line will certainly help. Lentor has more uniform developments (Lentor Villas, Countryside, Melody, Fudu) so if you like a particular design, just wait for next one to come into market. Banyan is particularly nice but land parcel is smaller generally.
 
As a NE person, Lentor is of course better than Cashew. With new expressway and MRT line akan datang, confirm better lah.
 
Good luck to your househunt.

Yeah Bukit Timah need at least 4m for a land size of 1600sqf
 
try upper bukit timah and Choa Chu Kang area. A tad cheaper. But you do pay for what you get.
 
You do woodlands if u dont depends on MRT and u get even cheaper

No hdb very near Lentor... nearest hdb to Lentor is 628 market area. 
I don’t understand why people don’t just say plainly where everyone stays or stayed. makes communication so much easier and we know where one’s reference is. Especially like many people mentioned every estate is pretty big, big variation even in Lentor or Kovan. Kovan esp is huge. 
 
I think a lot depends on how nested your place is the estate. I have walked like 5 times to 628 market in 10 years, partly because I have a car and my place is further from the market. My in laws are 70 years old and without a car. They walk there Everyday... helps that they stay in president gardens which is the closest development to the market. 
 
I am surprised people say the road traffic is better at Kovan than Lentor. Lentor more expensive yes to drive as cte erp is high, but I think getting to expressway from Kovan is more of a pain. I used to work at taiseng 10 years back and hated driving home Everyday through the traffic near Kovan. But I know traffic situation changes depending on what works are done or new developments so I don’t comment now. 
 
Kovan mrt is closer than yck mrt though. But with the new Lentor mrt, It’s probably even on mrt side.

No way I would have bought if the price is not lower than the last transacted.The price is rising only for new condos, if I will to buy a condo now, I would rather buy a resale FH or 999 condo  , it will be cheaper than new one around the same area, the saving is more than enough  for  Reno plus some spare saving.

When I bought my place, I am Glad we narrowed it down to near our parents place. 
 
In the end, we chose an estate which my Wife grew up in. So there is basically no surprises...
 
I think good bad factors is all ok as long as you know about it before buying. Just buy a place u are familiar comfortable with.

TS, did you consider sprinleaf area opp Ngee Soon camp? I think there few developer units left, price point 3M-3.5M. One drawback is without built-in wardrobe.

Just FYI. If I remember correctly, According to my parents faber area was a former land fill. His cousin had a bungalow there which needed to be treated for termites a few times. But this was about 30years  backOne of the most common termites come from the ground, no landed could be immuned from termites except to treat or better,  prevent it by getting pest control to do longer term termite  treatment, still, there is no permanent solution. One chemical injection by some established pest control cost about 5k and above, they will drill holes from the wall down to the ground so that chemical could be injected down to the ground.

How’s about a rebuilt unit?
this is a tricky part of buying a landed. the price cannot be based on land size alone.  The price of two units with similar land size side by side, one that has a rebuild area of up to say 4,000 build in area vs one that is original condition, the price will be significantly difference. And if both are rebuilt, age of the house, quality of rebuild and material used etc etc will have difference to the price of the two units as well.

How significant difference is considered reasonable? 
Simply add the cost of rebuilt, ie. $250-300 psf?

Unlike HDB or condominiums where the selling price psf is more or less the same within the same development or district , the psf (land) of landed properties is a different ball game altogether . 
 
If you  do a search on URA Caveat lodged for recent transcated price of landed properties , you will find that the psf ( land) price can differ greatly , by up to 50% or some 100% . 
 
Corner terrace will command low psf because of the bigger land size .
A recently rebuilt unit will cost more psf than an original unit .
For buyers looking to build their own home ( quite common for landed property hunters ) , they would prefer a property where the house is almost run down so that they only pay for the land
If a buyer likes the property's unit number ( maybe its his lucky number ) , he will be willing to pay more
For cul de sac , some like it because its more quiet , but some superstitious will avoid because its bad fengshui 
Some willing to pay more because they live nearby and want to buy one for his children
Some properties you check the transacted price is very low because its father change name to children and want to avoid hefty stamp duties fees
Some properties look OK but no one likes because its near substation , or maybe the street lighting is facing it directly like a parang 
Some like to stay near amneties and eateries for convenience , some dont like because of parking or rat issues
Some like to stay near nature reserves but some dont like because got monkey and snake problems . 
 
Many , many ,differents reason for varying psf price . No right no wrong , to each his own .
 
In short , if you like it , just go for it .

Never had to treat for termites at one of the locations (just periodic inspection) while the other requires regular treatment.  But not a big problem lah.

Bigger land size means more versatile down the road. More design options when the time comes to rebuild. Also can rebuild to a bigger built-up area up to the plot-ratio limit. 
 
In the interim, bigger land allows more fruit trees to be planted, or even an above ground pool to be installed. However, if the house is in the tree conservation area, planting a tree will be akin to shoot self in foot. Once the tree reaches 1m girth, the tree cannot be cut without NParks permission. End up, that any rebuild will have to be designed around the tree.

Yes by professionals. Usually i will get someone to come in to check right after moving in and if no termite is detected, I will call them back a few years later.  If infestation is found, then they would have to treat it and come back more regularly. 
When part of the door is eaten away, might be too late liow cause they started from inside dark humid area.

Not that bad la. Our houses are still made of concrete. And also you can see them at the doors.  The worse are the roof rafters. Unless you climb up to inspect regularly. Change door, repair door frame still cheaper than touching the roof. New houses with those curved interlocking roofs are the best. No leaks no problems. But aesthetically boring.

Yes should be able to see. But the est control contractor will take a screw driver or whatever to knock all the woods to look out for telltale signs. They do it once every 3 months

It all depends on the quality of the build.
I have seen some very cheap type.
Using fake marble, china porcelain tile and cheap bathroom fittings.
Very cheap can do already.
 
If use real and good stuff, the price can be easily 3 to 5 times
 
So you have to ask what kind of house you want.

3-5 times!? If original condition $1500 psf, good rebuilt can be 4500 and above?3 to 5 times of the Reno cost does not equate to the total construction cost.

3 to 5 times of the Reno cost does not equate to the total construction cost.I see, I thought rebuilt is not reno.  As one bro here says it costs him $270 to build psf, is rebuilt unit should be price for original unit plus rebuilt up x $270 as a guide

The difference is very great in terms of looks, feel and finish.
 
Same with everything else.  Eg. Cars, watches, shoes etc...

Even if 30% more the price of an original unit at the same area, is not considered too high?

It all depends on the quality.
 
One good italian sofa can cost easily $15k from Space
Some people settle for $1.5k from novena.
Some others can do $8k 
 
So its what you like vis a vis what you can afford and what you are willing to spend
 
If you are still asking these questions at this stage, i can tell you are not ready or simply just a troll.

Have you seen some of the newer ceramic tiles from China, I think recently they have caught up with the western companies
 
I saw some of their lower cost tiles look very high end
 
but at the same time, their price is also slowly moving up
 
natural stone still depends on the quarry though
surprised China so big, they still haven't extracted equal quality to Italian natural stone
 
the other thing that has improved tremendously is synthetic stone, some of them (high end ones) look so natural and are highly resistant to damage - burn proof, liquid proof, stain proof, scratch proof. but very expensive

Yes i have seen,Bro.And they do look pretty good.
However, they still fall short of the real thing.
(Porcelain vs real marble)
They are also still lower in quality to the european ones.
 
Am using greek marble and italian marble for my living dining and baths
 
I did choose to use some “synthetic stone” tiles/ ceramic but these are also all Italian made.
 
One key difference is the number of variation.
Good European tiles come in higher variations at least 36 to 48 compared to china tiles usually 16 up to 24 only 
 
Another feature is the rectification of european tiles.
They come usually with a choice of rectified version.
This means that the edges are cut to perfection and therefore they can be placed closer together requiring a thin grout.

italian marble for jailhouse theme, too high end lah
 
I always wondered about the law of diminishing returns and why do people spend crazy amounts of money to buy super expensive bags...
 
They always say the quality is better but after a point, does more money buy you better quality or just rarity?

The supplier will cut it. You can actually go draw marks on the stone to choose which part you want cut, based on the pattern you like to see.
 
For flooring they try to match back all the same direction of swirls after cutting.

Marble is dry laid and numbered according to pattern for the final laying
Not easy job so the installation cost is also higher
But also not too expensive lah

Although I don’t buy watches but I assume watches can keep and up value sometimes so there is actual sense buying the real thing. 
I do see u spent a lot of effort and money into rebuilding. Hopefully it turned out well as it is a huge investment in time and money. 
 
 my contractor said a full timber plank is expensive for the stairs so in the end we used parquet on the stairs which is prob not a good idea as over time, it develops unsightly small gaps.
 
Your pics looks processed . Probably good to get some pro photos taken right after completion to preserve the new look.

Ya, what you do with your house is entirely up to you. The original question on wall tiles is solely for knowledge sharing cuz we were impressed by some of the showroom porcelain wall tiles we have seen. Just wondering on any practical issues with using porcelain tiles. 
 
If it’s a solely aesthetic thing, then that is something I will keep in mind when I do my next place. 
 
At the end of the day, all of us work within our Budget and the concept of value is so subjective so don’t be so sensitive lah.

No problem lah
I scared you sensitive so i draw the line.
I share some knowledge with you ?
 
Porcelain tile is basically just color applied on the tile and glazed.
It cannot achieve the real mesmirizing look of natural marble which allows you to see into the material
 
Secondly natural marble can be cut to near perfection and complete flat and therefore can be laid very closely
As the cutting is near perfection, when applied onto a big floor and buffed to a light shine, it looks like one single surface
 
China Porcelain tiles cantachieve that
They have to be placed further apart where the grouting will be wider
Porcelain tiles are not 100% flat, they are wavy
So if you apply them on the floor you can see the ugly waviness all stretched out
If you apply onto wall, you will see the waviness from the side
 
Next time you go showroom , take a look closely this time
The waviness is just so fake and unacceptable to me

Oh yah @wind30 natural marble can be polished to regain its lustre
And even if it is chipped, you will see the exact same composition underneath
 
Porcelain tiles have a fakish super shine and when chipped exposes the clay material underneath

Don't go off tangent and poke each other la. Peace 
In general, tiles are not common finishing for walls
 
Except for the bathroom
 
For bathroom:
Porcelain is easier to maintain. It does not stain. And better for old folks. As you can choose those with rough surface
 
Marble is prettier. But is porous
 
For other parts of house:
Like i said, tiles is not a common wall finish . Sizes are smaller and will see many grout lines
 
So natural stone is better as you can get larger sizes , hence less joining lines

I also used some ceramic tiles for the bathrooms.  
But again, my choice was the european ones which are really nicer in color tones and texture with more variation.  
 
For double to triple the price and i definitely appreciate the better quality.

thanks :) I will look out for the waviness next time. Google also say Marble is a bit transparent and lets in light so there is a glow effect that cannot be duplicated by porcelain. 
 
It is just 10 years ago I don't think I have seen porcelain tiles that are so marble like when I did my reno.

Yes only quite recently the “printing” on the porcelain tiles especially the italian and spanish ones are very sharp and alive.   From afar it is not so easy to tell the difference.
The chinese made ones are dead giveaways but they compensate with their low price
 
You can get anything and everything, its just how much you can and want to spend.
 
In terms of timber stairs which you highlighted, my choice for the steps was to use a solid piece of wood. 
Brings out the style color and character of the entire wood grain much more than parquet short strips.
Price of course more expensive for long solid piece.

Haha that would drive me nuts. Too OCD..Then you must go slab cut only. 
The irony is that for small porcelain tiles, they are very easily matched becos basically the design is printed on a very big mould and then the pieces are cut.  Like a big jigsaw puzzle.
 
In one of the baths, i used italian ceramic tile 60x60 and also specifically asked for them not to match just whack.

Yes small place, please give chance. ð
 
But I know my limits..... thats all i can do.
Already middle age, cant expect too much going forward.
Just trying to create a best home for me and family.
 
No family business to take over
No inheritance to speak of
Am contented already.
The race is and always against oneself

for landed rebuild, 1M goes very fast, no need to be a extra large area. Especially if you use premium materials

Theres quite heavy cost on adding a floor and also the steel structure and reroofing and off form concrete required
 
Materials and fittings also make big difference 
Cheap bathroom mixer tap $80
Branded German bath room mixer tap $500
 
Guess which one i chose....

Ya, what you do with your house is entirely up to you. The original question on wall tiles is solely for knowledge sharing cuz we were impressed by some of the showroom porcelain wall tiles we have seen. Just wondering on any practical issues with using porcelain tiles.
 
If it’s a solely aesthetic thing, then that is something I will keep in mind when I do my next place.
 
At the end of the day, all of us work within our Budget and the concept of value is so subjective so don’t be so sensitive lah.

 
yup, hybrid is good. Porcelain for the toilet is way more effective than marble from a cost perspective.

usually people don't spend much time in bathroom, hence it needs not to be spacious

Bathrooms are very important hor. Walk into any public buildings, just look at their toilets you know the standard of the building liao. Similarly, the toilet standard of a condo or house will tell alot of the quality.  Some shower enclosure, you have difficulties even to turn around.    but huge balconies just because there are incentives for building them.

Well said, Bro
You are clearly someone who knows
Unlike the many others who create a din but shallow in these knowledge.
 
Bathrooms are truly the finer detail in any house.

not spacious does not mean low standard
 
i meant need not so big bathroom if we don't spend too much times in it
 
i would prefer a spacious balcony over a spacious bathroom
