Too many common condo already, they don't have the time. Whether or not the renovation can fetch money is up to the buyer to decide not the seller, banks or the agent. Having said that, reno does help but don't expect that you can fetch a dollar to dollar compensation.

Actually, they refer to the last transaction price, using that as a quick guide, then plus or minus depending on other factors such as:
 
1. Facing
2. MRT
3. Leasehold / Freehold
4. Market demand/ supply 
5. Facilities
6. High floors etc...
 
If there are new condo developments in your area, be prepare to face price competition. Depending on the property cycle that you are going in, the newer projects could price lower than the older estates.
 
From my personal experience, renovation cost is just like car prices, the market value will depreciate over time, so I would usually discount renovation cost when negotiating with the sellers. For example, if your seller throws in a plasma TV that was paid $10k one  year ago, would it still worth $10k in today's market???

No problem.
 
Agent can give you a estimated valuation, though they can also consult their valuer, but ultimately, the housing loan comes from the bank, so must check with your banker. Eg: if the seller's asking price is $100k but your bank valuation is $70k, then the difference of $30k must come from your own pocket. 
 
This is my understanding in layman term, but for details, you need to check with your bank.

If you have exact address and unit no., just call up any reputable property company, etc JLW or DTZ and they can give you a verbal valuation.  Take a 5% cut from that to be conservative then you should be quite safe.  
 
I recently sold my property slightly below valuation but buyer and myself are both satisfied with the deal.  So it's a win-win.

Hi,
not wanting to dampen your condo hunt mood but you might want to wait till Q3/Q4 2008 for a better deal. The current market sentiment is quite low actually. There might be some "boss jump down from building" (老板跳楼大减价) price later this year.

It is not going to fall. 
 
Property always tie in with inflation and no way property prices is going to fall when inflation is going up the roof.
 
Those who are doing the wait and see is going to be sorry.

but theres property bubble that burst and due to that alot of owners who bought their houses at peak prices are suffering negative equity, so why do u say no way property prices will fall? there was many life examples on this, like before the 98 crisis property was sky high and after that, property prices dipped.

Of course there are bubbles everywhere, but the "bubble" for the current property market has not even begin yet. 
 
If you have people everywhere doing a wait and see (reported in Today's paper), then obviously the "mania" hasn't even started. 
 
The local property still has much legs to go, I don't see it crumbling down at least not until 2010.

Bro, nothing is for sure in this chaotic global sentiments. All it takes is another 9-11 and you will soon see many more MRT track jumpers when the property market crash.

Well.....
 
1stly: You can check the following link and determine how many units have transacted recently in the project you're interested. You can have a "feel" of the recent demand.
 
http://www.ura.gov.sg/realEstateWeb/realEs...nController.jpf
 
2ndly: The world is experiencing a slow down in the property market. I believe that Singapore will not be immune from it.
 
US property:
Needless to elaborate further due to the sub-prime issue in US
 
UK property: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml...2/nhomes122.xml
 
 
3rdly: In SG, the number of enbloc deal had gone down dramatically in Q1 2008. Also, with the removal of the defer payment scheme in october 2007, 
 
http://www.ura.gov.sg/pr/text/2007/pr07-120.html
 
a lot of speculator would need to come up with hefty downpayment for a property, compared with $0 downpayment when the defer payment scheme is in place. => less buyer/speculator around in the market.
 
4thly: If you dun believe me, put a sale advertisement (on the property you're interested) on the newspaper and see how many expressed interest. I believe the market will not tell a lie to u. I might be wrong also here

If tommorrow have another 9-11, trust me, maybe a week of stock market turbulence and things will just go back to normal.

that is the problem. Everyone is thinking the property market will crumble at 2010... after IR is built, all the en bloc redevelopments are done, there will be a huge increase in supply.
 
Currently the price is up mainly by the enbloc sales, so many units taken out of the market and undergoing redevelopment. A lot of people with ready cash to buy new property. 
 
Even bullish people like you think that the property market may crumble at 2010, while almost everyone I spoke to feel that 2010, the property market will drop a lot. errr.... if everyone THINK 2010 property will fall, which idiot will buy a property now and push up the price in 2008/2009....
 
That is why EVERYONE is waiting :) for 2010 
 
anyway, my idea to buy property is simple, usually there is a period when the price dropped a lot and everyone is thinking that it will drop further or no hope to rise in the future, then I buy. It is not difficult to time this I think as the property cycle are long and slow. Example, now although nobody wants to buy, the price still never fall because people are unwilling to lose out to their neighbour... usually people can wait for 1-2 years. BUT as 2010 comes closer, people will panick than price will fall.
 
my 2 cents. 
 
PS: I bought my property in 2002

I am neither bullish nor bearish....I only say based on what the market tells me through its behaviour on the charts and the fundamentals that governs capital markets.

I still think it depends ont he project's qualities.....this time round of property increase , quite a number are foreginers parking their money here...so i think for the better quality ones, the panic to sell is not so great..
 
wife bought a 2 bed room unit in 2005 after IR announced....just got offered 1.5k psf yesterday cause the rental yield is very good..but she din take it up....(her call, later i ask her sell , it go up somemore sure kenna nag  )

Not directed at you Starry...just dropping an opinion
 
 
Often we hear people say this and say that but when it comes to doing, they dont do as they say.
 
Everyone has their own idea of where it will go but when it comes to such money matters, buying/selling properties/stocks etc... i live by one rule.
