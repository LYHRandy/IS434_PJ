Apparently these are all pigeonhole interiors. Below are my personal opinions only. Feel free to disagree.
 

Acceptable
 

Nice-ish but may look obiang next time


 

Nice but very cookie cutter design


 

Nice cozy feel but a bit grandmother-ish


 

Ok but looks a bit empty


 

Neutral
 

Looks a bit cold and incomplete


 

Obiang
 

Too fruity


 

Look like nightclub


 

Some will think it's stylo but I don't like

all dun liken but if really given a choice, the grandmother one.
 

if choose such gaudy design, after a while don't maintain house tidy and clean, it looks very messy.

First 4 are all OK to me.
 

4th one is probably easiest to diy although it seems to be missing some final touches.
 

Not say I act atas but sometimes I wonder if it is worthwhile to decor a HDB until so nice. Once I open the door or even look out the windows, it is very hard to maintain the illusion

No. 4 for me, simple ... and it suits the sea-view look. Too cluttered or atas and it wont really match. IMHO la :)

The grandma one looks the best among them. But I wonder why Singaporeans like their home to look like hotel, office recept area, nightclub or fancy pub.
 

A home for me should feel like home, & lived.

You're entitled to your tastes but this just looks old school country style.
 

In the 90s, there was a trend for cornices and other roman-esque finishing touches.
 

Nowadays it is fancy laminates and feature walls.
 

The key to a timeless feel is simplicity and a cohesive design intent.

Noticed that all except pic 3 have carpets. Personal preference is 4+5 but without carpets.
 

Like uncluttered design so that i can take my time to clutter it up with stuff...hehe. In the past, i love country and banyan look but find it tough to maintain. Probably a more house proud person will do more justice.
 

Thnx for sharing pics....
 
 
 

Safe ride and great weekend guys

The trend now is to like their home look like showroom flat.   For me house should be as simple as possible, dont really like deco and many things around to collect dust.

Can be simple also, like this. Do not have to spend a single cents on interior designer.


 

Like most Singaporean, I grow up to like the modern 'hotel' like design, like in the pictures post before. 
 

The important thing about a home for me, is something is there because you put it, not first day, but differnt thing come differnt time, & the home is processively improve along the years. 
 

I am saying this as I have seen many of the modern homes as well as the 'old country style' homes, admittedly not so much in Singapore, & I can tell you the feel is very different. I cannot go back to those modern design anymore after that, but it could be just me.

BUT it is amazing how small HDBs have shrink. Those photos were probably captured with wide angle lens and it means the units are a lot smaller in real life than the photo.
 

So much for hdb size not changing.

I am thinking it is quite possible to make the living room look nice with only funiture, carpet, curtains and maybe painting a wall. No need for interior designer or excessive carpentry.
 

Anyone tried painting the wall or ceiling before? Easy or back breaking? Got tips to share?

you need those big rollers to paint an even look. not as easy as it seems. Helped my parents repaint my home before.

If you are the chin chai type who don't mind uneven painting. then go ahead. 
 

Anyway even if u get ID, u have to self furnish also.

Clean lines, uncluttered looks and natural raw materials make the cut for me.

Anything with too much carpentry , i avoid.
 

Also good pieces of furniture make the difference.

I take the granny style.  At keast can envisage it to age gracefully.  Other design not lasting, impractical for home and most likely need to go for overhaul.
 

Most importantly, its just my person opinion and taste.

Btw, I am looking for donor for canvas painting.  Intending to DIY a movable partition using the painting so that it can also function as a nice decoration against the wall.
 

Not ping to spend too much init but if got lobang for cheap and nice canvas painting, do recommend.

+1.
 

Someone once told me when he choose a place, obviously the size matters. The space, the emptiness is what is needed.
 

If put in things that are non-functional, it may clutter the place. 
 

What is needed is the Emptiness, to live in.
