People,
 

Looking at current property prices, will you cash out on your ONLY property to downgrade??
 

Let's say if one downgrade the property to a small leasehold 99yr condo, one can probably free up a lot of cash (1-2mil?)
 

The point is what to do with the cash. Buy overseas property? London? Singapore is no1 foreign buying of London properties... Australia? 
 

I am seriously thinking about this route with the current property prices... Jurong hitting 1700 psf....
 

Is it a good idea? My previous neighbour sold his place together with me in 2009 and he went rental while I upgraded... needless to say, he is screwed...

I know of a few people who did recently.
 

I myself sold one just 2 weeks ago (not my primary residence though)
 

My basic principle is dont play with your primary residence.

But, really.....

Where is the upside?

The Govt is throwing such a bloody big signal and yet people dont see it.
 

I respect those who do, at least they put their money where their mouth is.

Thumbs up!

If it's your ONLY property, better not, unless you're thinking of totally uprooting yourself and settling in some other country, and that also, in the cheaper suburban or rural areas... then only can you make a decent profit.
 

Else it'd just be sell high, and buy high.
 

A relative did the same, selling his flat of >20 yrs for a tidy sum, then in just a matter of few months passing, realize that what he made from the sale can only afford a much, much smaller place with the flats of current design! Worse, he balked at this fact, and refused to make a decision, waited some more... 
 

Now LL have to opt for those 30-yr lease flats for the elderly (he qualifies), also tiny space, but at least have enough left over for old age expenses...

I guess you probably can...... Provided you can accept the downgrade. For hdb owner, please drop the idea as not much to downgrade to. The agent fees, reno etc, not much to earn lah. If condo in city, downgrade to one in sub urban....maybe still ok lah. Easy if no kids and school issue. If landed, maybe can downgrade to condo. Got to get use to less space.
 

Put it that way, sell high buy high. To get a difference in the process means you are giving up something.if acceptale to you and your family, by all means.

Well it really depends a lot of what is your current property and are you ok to move to a new place which may not necessary be a worse off place. As long as you buy and sell at the same time, it is ok. I believed those who pay 200K COV to buy million dollar HDB property are those downgrading. Imagine selling a $2M property and moving to $1M property. There might be a "downgrade" of property but you have $1M extra cash to upgrade your lifestyle or even retire if you know how to invest. Below is a link to an interesting read about why downgrading is good when property prices boom

Some safer investments include telco and reit. Assuming they give 5% yield. $1M investment is 50K dividend tax free

Thanks for sharing the example. It illustrates quite simply, how "downgrading" the home, can actually "upgrade" the lifestyle. 
 

But to a large % of Singaporeans, face might matter more than their actual wealth, so, upgrading their home and cars are the way to go for them.

If it is a landed, then do not sell. Freehold landed is a gold mine as there is hardly any new supply and the gap between landed and condo will get wider.

Yes, decent rental yield for me. About 4%.
 

But dont ever fall into the trap of staying put simply becos of a good yield.

Rental is never for good, tenants come and go, and if you get a bad one, it becomes a nightmare.

When you wait until it is time to sell, it is usually too late becos everyone else is selling.
 

For me, its simple and quite disciplined. 

Investment Environment not to my liking, and target price hit, i sell. 
 

I may not be right all the time but at least i will live for another day.

I recently sold my condo and moved to exec hdb.  Can't see prices continuing to go up with the ridiculous number of new launches.  Move means I am in a bigger place and the mortgage is gone.  Not bad for when I bought for first time at end of 2009.

The one he sold was just one of his extra properties.
 

He still has a nice permanent roof over his head that he ain't gonna sell.
 

If you only have ONE property, the one you and your family are living in, sell at your own risk.  Don't forget your family's future well-being will also depend on your hedge.
 

Whatever it is, don't end up homeless, living in a tent at the beach and then blame the govt.

ya got one family I know of - sold their HDB in 2010 or 2009 and rented their neighbour's HDB to stay. The parents still proudly proclaim they are waiting for the crunch and sounded like some experts at predicting it will come in 2012. 

I hope they are fine now.

The problem is a lot of people buy in to the marketing tactics of property agents. 
 

one's primary residence should NEVER be called an investment. I hate it when property agents tell you to INVEST in property with your one and only house. That's crazy.
 

the primary residence is a NEED. Investments are WANTS. It does not matter how much your primary residence has appreciated in value.

Most imptly , is to secure a roof over your head at all times. If you sell and immediately get a roof for the family. And even better if you can pay off the entire mortagage with the sale. But if you are like many others, sell and rent, then your risk is much higher and not advisable if you have a family. 
 

BTW , do checkout your LTV if you seriously thinking of moving. With the change in the new debt ratio , dun be caught by surprise that your loanable amt is cut by 1/2. 
 
 

The mkt can go either way now. Everyday government chu new pattern. You never know if the new debt ratio is pre-emptive act for re-opening the employment flood gate. I heard there is going be some big announcement for the East Coast area..

Actually hor, if someone is going to pay 1-2mil more that what he has paid for the same unit in 2009.. i dun see why he should sell if he has the holding power. There muz be great potental in the area.. that's why it going up at a fast rate....

For HDB, a friend sold last year his flat at Sembawang at a good price with 60k COV and moved on to buy a new EC, currently staying with parents while waiting for EC to complete. got another friends still trying to sell his HDB since March this year as he also wanna relocate to another location... But bec of new cooling measure in Jan this year, he got less than 10 viewing since March until now.. location Jurong West. 
 

These properties really like stock market.. when market hot, any stocks will just go up. Like any properties in any locations also can sell.. when market is controlled, only the good locations seems to be moving..

The lump sum looks alluring when property is sold. But u only have a 1/3 chance of winning. So don't play this bet if it's yr only home.

Spot on.
 

After putting up a show, killing off some FW-dependent businesses and some sweet talk to the public, they will open the floodgates again.  Human resource is the only resource that Singapore has, and one has to be dreaming if one thinks the govt gonna reduce the population instead of increasing it.
 

Singapore is heavily dependent on FT/FW and new citizens.  The experts can pontificate all they want about weaning our reliance off FTs/FWs and population increase but that is not gonna happen.
 

The people can demonstrate at Hong Lim all they want too but that's not gonna change anything.
 

2016 elections?  You can place your wager on the outcome and the effect on the economy if you have capital to play, but not wager your only roof on that, please.
 

You can sell all your investment properties if you think prices are gonna crash but must at least keep a roof over your head.

FH will matter if die die want to stay/buy back in the same area. The replacement cost of FH is lower if the unit enbloc or sold off.  For LH your property depreciate at a higher rate than FH in the same area.

Not a good idea since it's your only property. This is not investment. You are just gambling blindly. What other ppl do is their problem. I have seen too many ppl trying to follow other ppl's footsteps and got nothing good out of it.

that the value of resale mkt.. in the enbloc mkt, it's alot of difference.  Now developers can slice the FH deed to L99 developments. This means that they could get back more than double their investment.
 

Aniway, tht a own-stay property, always to go for FH or HDB, when your replacement cost is always controlled.

Spot on again.
 

Govt is the ultimate beneficiary and price-setter.  They will not, and have never, worked against their own interests.
 

The principle of "every square foot of land in Singapore has the potential to be Raffles Place" never changed, and yes, from their accounting point of view, the govt is losing money every time they release land to build HDB.  Hence the oft-misunderstood "subsidised HDB" line from the govt that many critics like to harp on.
 

Every govt in the world would want their property prices to be healthy and high as this is one of the barometers of the nation's economic health.  How high a country's property prices are is an indication of how economically and socially attractive that country is.  You may laugh at that, but it is true even within the same country.  NYC property prices are much much higher than say, Detroit.  Shanghai much much higher than Harbin or Urumqi.

The pty was hot since 2008, those that bought in 2009 still got a neat profit.. your theory seem abit too simple. The property markt is actually quite complex and the factors contributing to prices is multi-facets. 
 

I would say that sg econ continues to be healthy.. and there is still potental upside to investment if your horizon is 10-20 yrs. I cannot say the same for london , Oz, Malaysian pty. If i going to increase my pty investment, its going to SG.  However, if you are looking for short or mid-term investment in sg pty, i think it may not be 1 straight road up.
 

Actually the demand for rental units may go down in the next few yrs.. as cost of 2nd pty goes up... allow those that are currently on rental to back to homeowners. But its never the same now.. 2 yrs ago when they sell.. they can afford to by 1.5 mil condo.. now the debt ratio kicks in, they could only afford 800k loan.. Condo is almost impossible if they wants a decent 3 bedrm.

During boomtime, logic takes a back seat. How can LH and FH be ard the same psf? (or even higher in some cases)
 

In mean, would one pay the same for a car that has a 10-yr COE vs a car that has no COE expiry?

If it is the ONLY property, then it is a clear NO. I dun like to pay rent and yet subject to landlord's whim and fancy. If I do sell, then I will immediately buy another, probably an downgrade in this current situation to take advantage of the high price.
 

If I have a HDB and a condo already, then I will only consider selling the condo. However, while prices may soften in the future, the existing policies means buying the replacement property will be harder. I can't see a scenario where the perfect situation of significantly lower price, no ABSD and easy financing happening together in the near future. Nevertheless, it is still a good problem to have. Most likely it is a case of whelther you want to cash in now or not. I will not consider selling the HDB at all for now as I still want to be able to downgrade back to this option.
 

No one knows for sure what will happen to prices. The first cooling measure started in Sep 2009. So, thats almost 4 years ago. As we alll know, price is still creeping upwards since. If not for the subsequent measures, property prices might have risen a lot quicker and a burst might had already happened. As such, I believe future price movements to be subtle in either direction. If price is to come down, it will be a slow decline. Thus, it is unadvisable to rent in such a scenario. I will rather ride thru the direct price erosion than paying 3%-5% rental yield on a annual basis. If price is to go up further, it is probably limited upside. The ABSD (7%, 10%) is to high to enter now.

Glad to see that most have a firm head on their neck.
 

I have said earlier and many many times in this forum not to play with your primary residence. 
 

But if you hv assessesd your ability to take that risk and are willing to put your money where your mouth is, thats what i respect.  This compared to the one who kpkb and give opinions and keyboard warrior but never does anything.
 

Good luck to all.  Cheers

if you have another place to stay temporary, why not?
 

when you sell high, you also need to buy high. if can afford to wait out a few years, might not be a bad idea.
 

but got to do it quick, with our dear $8 minister going on everyday about affordable housing, it will not be long when people will not be willing to fork out COV in the immediate future.
 

but private condos maybe a different story liao.

The pty was hot since 2008, those that bought in 2009 still got a neat profit.. your theory seem abit too simple. The property markt is actually quite complex and the factors contributing to prices is multi-facets. 
 

I would say that sg econ continues to be healthy.. and there is still potental upside to investment if your horizon is 10-20 yrs. I cannot say the same for london , Oz, Malaysian pty. If i going to increase my pty investment, its going to SG.  However, if you are looking for short or mid-term investment in sg pty, i think it may not be 1 straight road up.
 

Actually the demand for rental units may go down in the next few yrs.. as cost of 2nd pty goes up... allow those that are currently on rental to back to homeowners. But its never the same now.. 2 yrs ago when they sell.. they can afford to by 1.5 mil condo.. now the debt ratio kicks in, they could only afford 800k loan.. Condo is almost impossible if they wants a decent 3 bedrm.



 

So you put your money where you mouth is or not?

If it is the ONLY property, then it is a clear NO. I dun like to pay rent and yet subject to landlord's whim and fancy. If I do sell, then I will immediately buy another, probably an downgrade in this current situation to take advantage of the high price.
 

If I have a HDB and a condo already, then I will only consider selling the condo. However, while prices may soften in the future, the existing policies means buying the replacement property will be harder. I can't see a scenario where the perfect situation of significantly lower price, no ABSD and easy financing happening together in the near future. Nevertheless, it is still a good problem to have. Most likely it is a case of whelther you want to cash in now or not. I will not consider selling the HDB at all for now as I still want to be able to downgrade back to this option.
 

No one knows for sure what will happen to prices. The first cooling measure started in Sep 2009. So, thats almost 4 years ago. As we alll know, price is still creeping upwards since. If not for the subsequent measures, property prices might have risen a lot quicker and a burst might had already happened. As such, I believe future price movements to be subtle in either direction. If price is to come down, it will be a slow decline. Thus, it is unadvisable to rent in such a scenario. I will rather ride thru the direct price erosion than paying 3%-5% rental yield on a annual basis. If price is to go up further, it is probably limited upside. The ABSD (7%, 10%) is to high to enter now.



 
 

Enough of doomsday scenarios.. Lets have a discussion about how housing prices will move in near term future (3yrs~5yrs). I am guessing there is much more upside by 20~30% 
 

Reasons

1) Cheap funds from global central banks - As long as large foreign economies see unemployment figures drop, their respective central banks will keep pumping cash into the economy. (Footnote-: if my memory serves me well, the last property burst, housing loans are at ard 4+%, currently is 1.0x% with sibor)
 

2) Local buyers are much richer due to inheritance - Used to be 6~7 children. Nowadays, family sizes are shrinking and the increased affluence is passed down to lesser number of children, meaning we all have more to spend. As long as not the money in, money out type of spending, 80~90% with no other business/investment avenues will just put their money into property. Be it for self stay or 2nd property
 

Of course, just me personal opinion. Aint no expert on this. Just like the argue the flip side.

Thanks for sharing the example. It illustrates quite simply, how "downgrading" the home, can actually "upgrade" the lifestyle. 
 

But to a large % of Singaporeans, face might matter more than their actual wealth, so, upgrading their home and cars are the way to go for them.



 

Yup Tha's why a lot of them will forever be in the rat race trading their time for money. Let's compare 2 persons both 40. One stay in a EA , drive camry and no longer having to work. He can wake up late and enjoy his day doing whatever he please everyday. The other drives a merc and stay in a condo but have monday blues and need to report for work everyday. He have money but no time to enjoy the fruits of his labour, having no time to swim

Over the weekend I went to some central HDB parts of singapore - Henderson, Havelock, Redhill and Bukit merah - to drink at the coffeeshops with different friends. I have several friends who live in that HDB area.
 

What struck me was, in the absence of HDBs and markets in the area, this could be a very very premium private residential area. Elevated land, green hilly spots, very near orchard and CBD, this is simply an extension of the very upmarket Tanglin prime area.
 

I was just thinking that if the govt wanted they could en bloc the entire HDB estates and shift the population to Clementi or something and sell the land parcels to developers at very high prices.
 

Because having old and rotting HDBs, derelict people and problem families living in the area is simply a waste of what could be very valuable land resources and high revenue source for the MND.
 

My friends will fark me upside down if they knew I thought this way. Haha.

I know people like that, who made good money when young and retired early. They tend to grow old very quickly and their minds became not as fast as before.  There is only so much golf you can play and so many holidays you can take before rotting away into senility.

No leh. This area under Tanjong Pagar.
 

No contest GRC.
 

Plus Clementi and Jurong areas are PAP strongholds. It makes sense to shift the population there. Of course give them high comp for their SERS lah. Everybody happy.

Can do it gradually mah.
 

In any case, never heard of HDB people not happy with SERS one.  To them, it is like tio TOTO.
 

Not forgetting that Havelock, Bukit Merah, Henderson and Redhill areas got many old and poor people.  Actually most are old and poor people, with only a handful of those middle-class who bought the new flats.
 

The old and poor people will be jumping for joy at receiving the SERS money and option to stay in a newer flat.

People,
 

Looking at current property prices, will you cash out on your ONLY property to downgrade??
 

Let's say if one downgrade the property to a small leasehold 99yr condo, one can probably free up a lot of cash (1-2mil?)
 

The point is what to do with the cash. Buy overseas property? London? Singapore is no1 foreign buying of London properties... Australia? 
 

I am seriously thinking about this route with the current property prices... Jurong hitting 1700 psf....
 

Is it a good idea? My previous neighbour sold his place together with me in 2009 and he went rental while I upgraded... needless to say, he is screwed...



 

what about you? sold anything?

If you can think of that, am sure the gahment people already thought of it. It's only a matter of time and the pace they wanna go with the SERS programme. 
 

Luckily, these areas are still predominately local borned. Certain older areas with too many FT/FW PRs already enbloc to shift them to new flats. In order to get new flats, at least one of the couple needs to convert to citizen.

Should only downgrade if the current one is a burden to you, or you really in need of money. Not worth the risk to use your ONLY property for investment purposes.

They have already done so. Those 7 storey flats total 20 blocks...all en-bloc over to Henderson. Can you imagine how big that piece of land in Redhill is going to be. Replace those 7 storey to 30 storey HDB or even 40 to 45 storey condo to developers.

Over the last few wkend, happened to visit quite a few upmarket F&B joints/ , Fullerton , Fullerton bay , W hotel, Conrad, Margaritta & RWS .....all i can say.. dun under estimate the buying power in sg.. Seriously surprised how these places could be full given the price tags.

Enough of doomsday scenarios.. Lets have a discussion about how housing prices will move in near term future (3yrs~5yrs). I am guessing there is much more upside by 20~30% 
 

Reasons

1) Cheap funds from global central banks - As long as large foreign economies see unemployment figures drop, their respective central banks will keep pumping cash into the economy. (Footnote-: if my memory serves me well, the last property burst, housing loans are at ard 4+%, currently is 1.0x% with sibor)

Of course, just me personal opinion. Aint no expert on this. Just like the argue the flip side. 
 

Cheers



 

1) Financing is getting tougher due to cooling measures. So, no/limited access to this cheap fund. Moreover, interests rate is expected to increase. So both reasons will keep a lid on price rising. Personal debts are already all-time high. So, there are a lot of leverage game already going on. Whoever can buy might have already bought.
 

2) No comments. I think this group of lucky people may be too significantly small to affect property price. The price-to-income ratio is probably at an all time high now. That will be a more useful measure. 
 

Please dun get me wrong. I'm not saying price will definitely soften but I think it will be flat and price movements will be subtle. In addition, I think there is a higher chance for price to soften. As such, I will refrain from further investments/disinvestments.

Wah.. so optimistic... some ppl will be super upset if it goes up another 20-30%... it's probably in a 1/2 mill difference to him if he continue to hold on to the unit he just sold and obviously has no problem in keeping up the instalments.

I have some friends who are somewhat unhappy about SERS.
 

They are all in the Bukit Merah/Redhill Area - living in the flat for 30+ years, mortgage longtime already paid off - then suddenly, a notice for SERS - they get a newer, bigger place - but at a higher cost - need to top up between 50 - 150k! A bargain for most of us PMETs here - but still, they need to get a mortgage for 50-150k...but at the same time, they know they are sitting on at least 1/2 million profit!

i think TS mean cash out rather than investment.

agree that cash out is different from investment..... just like those who sold their freehold landed and shift to HDB mansionette. the extra cash after fully paying the hdb (steady roof, infact current landed might still have a few hundred k mortgage left) and the rest of the cash, if managed well, can grow or be the opportunity fund to buy a private if the mkt goes down or invest in other things. No stress even if one loses the job. 
 

Bottomline, how much of a downgrade can one or the family handle? That might be the key factor to consider.

Some cheapo management staff bring families there and charge under expense account disguised as work entertainment.  
 

If you're observant enough, there's actually a lot of abuse by senior managers in the corporate world.

People,

Let's say if one downgrade the property to a small leasehold 99yr condo, one can probably free up a lot of cash (1-2mil?)
 

The point is what to do with the cash. Buy overseas property? London? Singapore is no1 foreign buying of London properties... Australia?

Is it a good idea? My previous neighbour sold his place together with me in 2009 and he went rental while I upgraded... needless to say, he is screwed...



 

If after downgrading to a small condo you still have 1-2m to spare then your current property should be worth at least 3m?
 

One option is to sell it and buy 2 smaller properties so that you can rent out one for passive income.  Consider single owner for the 2 properties to avoid paying ABSD.

Singapore today is different from Singapore 10yrs ago.

We definitely have more richies, many from overseas too.

But still that doesnt mean endless property buying and in any case, the kind of property those people buy are not the kind that we buy.  The last time i was at Catalunya, i didnt pay either, heh.

He can wake up late and enjoy his day doing whatever he please everyday. The other drives a merc and stay in a condo but have monday blues and need to report for work everyday. He have money but no time to enjoy the fruits of his labour, having no time to swim



 




Oversimplifying things... Having to work does not necessarily mean one cannot enjoy the fruits of one's labour... 



 

Agree that Anshng oversimplify some things, but compare the two of them, worked similar, but lived differently, the one staying in EA / drive Camry can do any job he likes, and don't need to rely on boss face. If the one staying in condo / drives merc has enough levels of passive income to do the same, good for him. But the people I spoke to and know, more of them are doing the condo / merc route without enough passive income, and upgrades their home or car as soon as they can afford the loan. During boom times, they will have more "face" than the one staying EA or HDB and driving a cheaper car, but if recession comes, also die faster.

2) No comments. I think this group of lucky people may be too significantly small to affect property price. The price-to-income ratio is probably at an all time high now. That will be a more useful measure. 
 

Please dun get me wrong. I'm not saying price will definitely soften but I think it will be flat and price movements will be subtle. In addition, I think there is a higher chance for price to soften. As such, I will refrain from further investments/disinvestments.



 

I think you have to look at price to rent too as some of them use rent to finance the purchases. Or rather some of them are looking at rent vs interest rates as they think as long rent can cover interest payments, they are happy.
 

I think fundamentally you cannot run away from these three ratios as SOMEONE has to pay for the house. The problem now is that rent vs interest rates makes it seemingly affordable... The risk is that interest rates can fluctuate much more than income and rent.

Have already seen few live cases whereby they sell their own roof and hoping prices will drop to re-enter the market. 2 years liao and they are still living in rental and looking, looking and looking. Their emotions must be like ants on the frying pans now.

"Interest rates in the US and in turn, Singapore, are likely to pick up over the next one to two years, said DBS CEO Piyush Gupta.
 

This means now could be a particularly good time for borrowers to lock in loans at current interest rates.
 

Borrowers can look at switching from floating to fixed rate loans, added Mr Gupta."

that means cash out asap esp when buyers are going for developer sale and not subsale, before higher interest rate kicks in and owners feel pressure to let go

My personal view is that if its a HDB...forget it. 
 

You sell high...you will also buy high even if its a downgrade.
 

HDB is like CPF...can see but can't touch this.

all i can say is d way garmen handle cooling measures is messy. In the first place if they dont allow SIBOR to be set by SG bank assoc, n fix it higher so that property wont chiong, MND wont need so many measures which shot themselves in d foot as we deem them ineffective.
 

M@S is d one which can control SIBOR but they refuse coz they more worried abt hot $$ moving into S$ then they have 2 spend $$ buying foreign FX n selling S$. So IMO as a result M@S's doing, MND bopian keep throwing cooling measure but d more they do, d more they look like cannot make it.
 

WHy this big mess? Coz M@S have never experienced SIBOR being so low for so long, n refuse to adapt to d new normal n make a call to fix rates. Instead MND look like incompetents unable 2 handle d price pressure. Sigh
 

In other words, Sing$ issue is greater than SG property problems. From a pure asset value POV, yes Sing dollar n FX is much greater liquidity,... sianz

Actually it can be that simple if one can be contented and have some financial education. There is no ending to upgrades. After upgrade they are actually taking on more debt. Persoanlly I would prefer the freedom of having no boss, no stress and the freedom of going for 2wks to 1 mth tour as and when with no worries. next time yr relative ask u what u working, u can just say retire lo!

Agreed! Some things are worth striving for if they bring pleasure to your life. But sometimes, upgrading just to keep up with neighbours, really not worth it.

Yea I think that is something even those staying in condo cannot too. Seriously,how many can afford not to work for six months?  Unless one can make money work for them, else money will also run out one day if never work. So must learn how to make money work for you and not u work for money
 

Even if u drive Ferrari, drive one year already also sian. For those who drive merc,drive long already also sian. That's why the marginal happiness is very minimal as one upgrade.

Most people are conservative in nature. Selling a home (i.e. one's only property) is a risky move in any market. Anyone who do it is an agressive person in my view. If you really must do so, then it has to be a calculated risk. I.e. You must really think that price will move lower quickly and you will spend less money in replacing a home + rental during that search period. Mental accounting will always work against us. In the event, when price goes up against you, you will always think that the price will correct to the level you want. This mental accounting will cause many people to wait longer and eventually even if price do correct, the rental paid, inconveniences etc will already cause unnecessary distress to you and your family. 
 

I do not recommend selling one's home. If you do, you should immediately buy a replacement.

they see some people heng heng hit the jackpot, so they think they can do the same.
 

One can never time the market. If you sell and the pty crash in a year, you are darn good liao. Dont forget that with all the SSD, ABSD in place..mkt is a lot less volatile. And even if the market didnt crash and goes side way for years.. you are losing out with each passing day, helping someone else pay for his pty.

Actually the main thing is when you cash out, you have to "downgrade" and buy another one to stay and have the excess cash put into good use (buying a brand new car is not). Dun go the rental road and speculate, hopping the mkt will crash. If TS do so, should be able to enjoy a comfortable life, especially if he is downgrading from a landed to non-landed or condo to hdb

Sad to hear this.. but ... 

Insurance is a muz. They could have consider this as part of their financial planning, regardless if they sell or not.  
 

Have you thought of if they had bought a pte pty, max their loan and didnt buy mortgage insurance... They will probably end up in worse scenerio.  
 

In any case, whether to cash out or not.. really depends on individual. As mentioned , it shld be a calculated risk. very calculated .. you need to know what safety nets you have if things turn for the worse, cut lost point and what kind of house you are looking for. In a bull or bear mkt, there are still good buys. Cashing out give you the time advantage when you negotiate for a deal esp for subsale. To be able to fork out 200-300k in 2 wks, many will need to sell their first pty first.

to ans you, 
 

1 the cancer came in fast and lethal. 
 

2 Even if they are to buy one immediately after the onset of cancer, no insurer will be willing to cover their house. I am not so sure about the status of their other personal insurances. With the money after cashing out, they can buy another place.. but as the mkt is still high, they have to downgrade at best.

Mortgage insurance is purchased during the time they got the flat.

And it's from insurance co. 
 

It's not necessary to cancel off the mortgage insurance once u sell off 

The flat as it can be "used" as a form of term insurance. 
 

Term insurance = high coverage, low premium.

The coverage is on the life of the insured... Not whether got property or not. It's at the onset of insurance applications that having an outstanding loan is a criteria for approval for mortgage insurance bec mortgage insurance is one of the lowest cheapest premium insurance offered by insurers, hence their risk is highest for this kind of policy.

Nope! Insurance co. will honour the contract. The agreement is based 

on point of inception of policy. 
 

Tats why it's always good to get HPS from HDB n mortgage insurance at

The same time from private insurer.

U could enhance your coverage further by taking up HPS as well as private

mortgage insurance! 
 

Check with HDB to check n insure your current outstanding loan amt, since buying 

HPS is considered "free" (premium payable using CPF, not cash)

Over the weekend I went to some central HDB parts of singapore - Henderson, Havelock, Redhill and Bukit merah - to drink at the coffeeshops with different friends. I have several friends who live in that HDB area.
 

What struck me was, in the absence of HDBs and markets in the area, this could be a very very premium private residential area. Elevated land, green hilly spots, very near orchard and CBD, this is simply an extension of the very upmarket Tanglin prime area.
 

I was just thinking that if the govt wanted they could en bloc the entire HDB estates and shift the population to Clementi or something and sell the land parcels to developers at very high prices.
 

Because having old and rotting HDBs, derelict people and problem families living in the area is simply a waste of what could be very valuable land resources and high revenue source for the MND.

I agree with Anshng regarding the merc drive long will sian, but for Ferrari range, wouldn't sian one. Actually, I'm thinking more of Lamborghini.. Coz it's   :wub:    Every time I see one on the road, I will wind down window just to hear the sound of the V10/V12 and also to stare at the car. Lamborghinis really make me feel like a 10 year old again. Haha.. 
 

Actually for me, I would be content staying in a HDB 4 room, with a MRS / Supra / FD2R...  




Theres no way in hell i can tire of a v8, 10, 12. If not for value, give me a 458 anytime over a nice condo.

Hdb aside..

not saying it is compulsory. But it is prudent to get it especially if you are to coshare the place with wife or whoever. So at least you wont pass the burden to her if the unfortunate is to happen.



 

Actually, term insurance shld be part of financial planing whether or not here is a house involved. It is prudent to take up term insurance if you are breadwinner of the family.
 

there are some pointers on mortgage insurance that you may want to know.

1) if you buy mortgage insurance provide by the bank integrated into the loan. It will be better that you have a separate insurance, in case you need change bank. example, you take up loan with mortgage insurance with bank A for fixed interest for x years. After x years, bank board rate go up high.. but you found out you have hypertension etc . Changing bank , will mean you need to find a new insurer and declare your current health status.. May end up struck with a high interest loan.   
 

2) you may want to compare existing term loan with mortgage insurance, some insurer offer even cheaper term loan .. So you may take that up instead of mortgage insurance esp if it is the 2nd-3rd pty.
 

3) remember to pay your premiums.
 

I am not a insurance agent nor a property agent .... just a regular person planning for my future .

to ans you, 
 

1 the cancer came in fast and lethal. 
 

2 Even if they are to buy one immediately after the onset of cancer, no insurer will be willing to cover their house. I am not so sure about the status of their other personal insurances. With the money after cashing out, they can buy another place.. but as the mkt is still high, they have to downgrade at best. 
 

3 I dont think anyone will buy a pty without getting a mortgage insurance right?




In place of the mortgage insurance (which is essentially insuring his life), he could have taken a term critical illness/ death insurance for himself if he is the source of income for the family.
 

So without the property, there is still an avenue, unless he was already un-insurable.

depends.. you need to checkout with your agents...
 

Last yr when i was sourcing for insurance, i find that insurance offer by AIA is cheaper. <$500 per pax for ~$800k coverage.. so i took up this insurance instead,  as it is non-reducing like Mortgage insurance , and gurantee renewal.

The stock of completed private residential units increased by 2,704 units in 2nd Quarter 2013. The vacancy rate of completed private residential units increased from 5.2% at the end of 1st Quarter 2013 to 5.6% at the end of 2nd Quarter 2013
 


Based on expected completion dates reported by developers, 11,998 units (including ECs) will be completed in the second half of 2013. Another 21,235 units (including ECs) are expected to be completed in 2014.
 

Looks like the table is turning soon at the end of the year.. With double the number of completed units...

Vacancy going to hit 6-7% liao...

need to count EC.. because these EC will free up some rental units.. as well as hdb. These will add rental mkt or hdb resale mkt. Ppl moving in to EC has to come from somewhere.. 
 

Prev quarters, the vacancy rate inch down even when new units are added.. 

But last quarter, the mkt failed to absorb the extra 2k units. 

So i think it has reach it's limit liao..The analyst are just "dreaming" an outcome, you need to look at the stat. Now it seem that its is turning..
 

This time the stats is showing signs liao.. 

Prices go down or not.. will still depends on holding power.. but def supply has caught up with demand in the pte pty.

one of the condo that TOP in early 2011. Still have 10% unsold. Alot of units i know is looking for rental still.

Although the prices move up from 1200psf to 1900psf. The mkt is mapulated. .. so be very careful when you buy anything.. always checkout what is the resale values of nearby condo before plunging into the new ones.. the premium shld be 10-20% more only..

Bro , you are right :) 

i think hdb resale will be first to get hit next qtr when EC tops.. these ppl has 6 mths to sell and selling only to SG. PR now is adapting a look and see approach because of ABSD.

Those kancheng spiders will sell with lower COV. And i wont be surprise end of the year.. we will see neg COV.

did the analyst predict economic crisis? tat will be the surest way for property prices to dip. don't bank too much on rising interest rates as a factor cos as long as ppl have jobs, there's no way in hell they will fire sell the property. 
 

Many are holding out for interest rates to rise then buy, believing that ppl will 'suddenly' all be retrenched and sell cheap. All i can say is they are most likely going to buy the same property price at higher rate or not buy at all.
 

That's why there's a saying, high don't buy, low don't buy, when to buy? My view is got money just buy!

actually my guess is "based on" ec very expensive

most first timer would buy bto rather than ec

2nd timer also have "price advantage" bec they can sell their bto to fund part of the ec

yup.. if your combine salary is only 10k ? ** ifthe requirement in 2008-9**. You have to be either an upgrader or there is parental support. Likely parents also moving, selling or renting out their current place.. So there will be more available units in the mkt.

i think (think only ah) now the bto stock is still bought by first timer bec hdb give 1st timer priority

maybe this 2nd timer bto group having to sell hdb one maybe not so big

market will keep going up as in property price? 
 

So what if property price keeps going up? It's not cash till u sell. The worry comes when cannot rent. But sometimes these same owners are stubborn and want to rent at high price, select certain races and lose money for several months or even years. Everything has a price. If the rental price is attractive, sure can rent cos it's a free flowing market. ok, now 6.9mil is more crucial than ever.

this is going to change.. cos' last time you can get tax rebate if you proof that you cannot get a tenant. Now if you cannot get , you still have to pay tax.. $200-300 per mth on top of mthly maintanance, not many ppl want to burn that kind of cash.. if units does not continue to appreciate, it literally burning cash away..

i think those first few batch of ec top one will get to sell their hdb earlier 

those last few batch to top one,  
 

last time mbt time, he dont want to build falts, first timer not enough, dont say 2nd timer

therefore no one want to sell their flat, so not enough resale units to go around

but this time round, kbw chiong the ec road, i estimate (anyhow pomp one ah) 60% * 400 units per site = 240 units resale units released into the mkt once each ec top

Analyst.. can predict all they want.. Stats wont lie.. Most SG are cash rich.. and low in mortgages and there a stable job mkt. Pte pty wont crash.. 

But with the latest stats for URA, we can see that it;s going to be a buyer mkt soon. Pricewise shld still be stable.

but this time round, kbw chiong the ec road, i estimate (anyhow pomp one ah) 60% * 400 units per site = 240 units resale units released into the mkt once each ec top  



 
 

it may lower the COV abit but dun tink 240 units will cause a 'crash'.......

actually my guess is "based on" ec very expensive

most first timer would buy bto rather than ec

2nd timer also have "price advantage" bec they can sell their bto to fund part of the ec  




if the ceiling is the same yes.
 

but EC income ceiling was adjusted to 12K remember?? those earning between 8to 12K on are the one buying i believe.

Some of my friends sold their primary residence or investment properties couple of years back, anticipating a price drop. Until now they are still waiting to buyback but prices have increased by around 30%. Even if there is going to be a correction in future, the upside would have already covered that.
 

With all the CM, SSD, ABSD, TDSR and probably more to come, going to be get even more difficult to purchase again.

But if you are sitting on good paper profit and wishes to cash out either to downgrade or for other ventures, may not be too bad an idea too. 
 

For me my answer would be NO, will hold my existing properties for now.

i just hope the herd effect will not be too big..

Alot of ppl , monkey see monkey do.. 

if too many ppl selling and not getting a good price.. alot more ppl will start to cash out (w or w/o holding power).
 

Another thing, now government require borrower/ to be property-owners. Alot of ppl that use other ppl name to buy will be hurt when their lock-in period with the bankloan is over.. they will start to pay 3-4% and cannot change bank.

come on.. if FT floodgate not close and there is no ABSD, no change in mortgage policy.. you think the stats will turn bearish... Need to based on facts.. not say say.. happy happy... 
 

There is still quite alot of ppl now waiting on the sideline with cash..for the government to allow them to purchase :P ha ha aha ..
 

Anyway, for pte pty to go down by 20-30%.. it will need herd effect, cos' sg are loaded with cash and savings , holding power super power..

Like it or not.. but stats dont lie... SG is cash rich, policy maker can say this say that to "malpulate" the mkt.. but you need to assess yourself. 305bil is only cash and deposit.. not include those in that are lying in stock and investment..

Like that hdb very difficult to come down to realistic level..



 

Cash poor ppl buying is MAS's own doing.. The prices never fall since they selling land so ex....only first time allowed to buy without penalty.. So you see alot of them carrying huge debts as a result..

1 is upgrade. 2 are singles looking to buy their own property. not 35 yet, so not considering hdb. one planning to get married in 1-2 yrs.

so all 4 are self stay leh.

alot ppl partying what..alot ppl buy before 2008.. now happy happy collecting rental of 5-7% yield..
 

Bro, only ppl not partying are those who are buying recently, which is say 5% of the owners.. and the MTB (Miss the boat) ppl.
 

For the pte pty prices to go to pre-2008 $.. is pretty impossible.
 

HDB on the other hand, if current policies dun change.. shld moderate to pre-2008, which is more realistic for average sg employee.

so no.. dont think many HDB will be sold at EC TOP.




Recently I got a friend a 2nd timer E-app to ballot for a EC in sengkang but few days later received an sms from agent saying that no more 80%-1st timer, 20%-2nd timer.

anyway, DBSS and EC is really what pushes the private Condo up.
 

before EC. the price bracket of Private condo was the same as the first EC launch.
 

if i did not remember wrongly. the moment gahment launch the EC. all the price of private condo soar liao. then its no turning back already.

Vietnam launches debt firm to rescue its battered banks 

Friday, July 26, 2013 - 18:45

Reuters

HANOI - Vietnam launched an asset firm to buy up the bad debts of its banks on Friday, a move touted as one of its biggest reforms but seen as merely a band-aid fix for its ailing, credit-starved economy.
 

The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) has faced long delays in setting up the Vietnam Asset Management Company (VAMC), or "bad debt bank", to rescue dozens of lenders crippled by what economists say is Asia's highest ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs).
 

The central bank's plan remains vague and the task is seen as a barometer of Vietnam's commitment to restructuring a once thriving economy fast losing its appeal among foreign investors. It grew 5.03 per cent in 2012, its slowest pace in 13 years.
 

The poor state of the economy has been blamed on banks that lent carelessly, especially to state-owned firms, leading to a credit drought, a real estate market crisis and bankruptcy of at least 120,000 businesses since 2011, government figures show.
 

At Friday's launch, SBV officials shed little light on how the asset management firm would operate and the central bank governor sought to temper expectations.
 

"This is not a magic wand to make all bad debt disappear. It's just a tool to help solve the bad debts in the banking system," Nguyen Van Binh said in launching the VAMC, adding its aim was to bring NPLs down to a "manageable" level by 2015.
 

The concept is similar to Thailand's when it set up an asset management firm in 2003 in the wake of the 1997-98 Asian economic crisis to tackle an NPL ratio of nearly 20 per cent.
 

The VAMC's working capital is 500 billion dong (US$23.6 million) - "miniscule" according to the World Bank's July 12 report. It will buy NPLs only on property assets in return for "special bonds", the SBV's deputy governor Dang Thanh Binh told Reuters in April.
 

'STRANGE COMPANY' 
 

The SBV has yet to say what the VAMC will do with the debt it buys. Vietnam's reluctance to increase foreign shareholdings in its banks beyond a 20-30 per cent cap has also added to doubts the bad debt situation can be easily solved.
 

"The government's approach to restructuring its banking sector is considerably different from what is generally considered as good practice," the World Bank said.
 

The level of success that can be achieved by the VAMC is subjective, since the real ratio of NPLs in the clogged and opaque banking system remains a mystery.
 

In a report to parliament in May, the government referred to a bad debt ratio of 4.51 per cent, but that estimate was derived from data from the banks themselves, some of which could face mandatory supervision or takeover. The SBV estimates NPLs at 6 per cent, or $7.8 billion, of outstanding loans of $130 billion.
 

Independent experts have estimated the ratio could be considerably higher.
 

Credit ratings agency Fitch said this month that the broad range of NPL estimates came from poor transparency, classification and accounting. The VAMC's structure meant it simply "buys time for banks to write off losses", it said.
 

News of the VAMC's launch had little impact on Vietnamese banking stocks on Friday, with lenders on the benchmark VN Index unchanged as the broader market closed up 0.4 per cent.
 

Nguyen Ngoc Oanh, a former deputy SBV governor, said more details were needed to assess whether the VAMC could be a success.
 

"This is a very strange company," Oanh told Reuters. "If it is buying bad debts, then where is the money coming from?"
