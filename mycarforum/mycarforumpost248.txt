Guys,
 

Anyone done this before?
 

I am thinking of buying a home in JB. Understand that the minimum costs of the house must be 

$250,000 minimum for a new property. I am thinking of taking a slightly higher loan to cover the deposit.
 

Any property agents have dealings/lobangs up North?
 

Do advise if its possible..
 

And yes I now JB is not really a safe place to stay but I am buying it as a 2nd property for retirement purposes and keeping it as an asset (freehold)

My advice: If u gonna sink ur $$ in MY pty, invest in prime KL real estate. Forget jay bee, port dickson, malacca or those usual s'porean traps unless u wanna flush ur $$ down the longkang.

i also harbour the dream of having a house in JB and then retiring there, can easily travel to and fro singapore.  Somehow the slower pace life style, cheaper and nice food, lower cost of living makes it appealing, granted that security is one main concern.

Bro 

get a good KL property...my friends 350k 2 bed room at seri bukit celyon somerset doubled in value over 2 years.
 

Seri Bukit Ceylon is a commercial-titled project, a serviced apartment. Developed by UMLand in partnership with Capitaland of Singapore and a Middle East investor, this project became an instant success through its' association with the Ascott Group. The Ascott Group runs a list of 4 and 5 stars serviced apartments in 3 different brands globally - the Ascott, Somerset and Citadines. Malaysia has its' 4th Ascott property through Seri Bukit Ceylon (others are Ascott Kirana opposite KLCC, Somerset Kuching and Ascott KL Sentral which is no more).

When buying MY property, look beyond the price. The quality of workmanship even for many prime properties are sub-SG stds. Buying from a reputable developer is quite important as you'll be more assured defects are rectified promptly and condo will be well maintained (as many prominent KL ppl own or will be staying there too).

ie to stay there lah, not rental returns.
 

friend who's a jb housing agent says u can forget about buying for investment if in jb....
 

reasons like build quality and maintenance not that good, unlikely to appreciate (so much land), difficulty in leasing out.... etc etc
 

bear in mind that if your malaysian lessee shows u the middle finger and refuses to pay rental, there's nothing you can do. nothing.

JB, Ipoh houses cheap..
 

a semi-D can cost 100k, as compared 1000k here in SG..
 

But then there are usually over-supply, so investment there, forget it... Its buy and stay there, coz rental market is well, almost non-existant there, well, at least for the rural towns..

Although there's a whole lot of "wise" advisors, I think the threat starter did not mention about buying for investment but for retirement. Its a fact that properties in Johore especially, do not appreciate. So if one is prepared to buy, its for your own stay - treat it like a "chalet" if you like and forget about it appreciating. Make sure its gated and guarded, though, even if it is not 100% safe but better than nothing at all.
 

Don't think you would bother driving up KL if its for retirement.

my cousin bought a semi-d in JB a few years back ..... only used it as a weekend getaway then.
 

but since last year, he moved there to stay instead as his job was nolonger office based .... just need to come back to SG once or twice a week .... he even rented out his SG flat and when he come back, he stays with his in-laws.
 

so basically, with the rent collected from his SG flat, its enuff to cover his installments for his JB property ... maybe got left over somemore ??
 

and also, last month's TODAY had lots of ads running for houses in JB .... from abt $110k (after"rebate") onwards for a 2 storey unit ard 1167sq..... is it worth it ?

If you are well travelled in Msia, should not be a problem living in Johore. You still get your TCS channels, Caldecott radio stations and in some places, even your Starhub/Singtel/M1 networks. Get your own (landed) space away from the crowded flats, why not?

If for retirement.... then buy when the time requires it. Not now.... and lock up your $$$
 

Prices don't appreciate since there's ample land to build new and also the over-supply.
 

Buying now for years into the future is also unwise from the standpoint of risk. (unit get broken into & things stolen, you do not know what new rules & regulations would change, etc) 
 

Also, years on.... the house fittings, paintwork, etc..... (maintenance items) will need working on and that means $$$. (Why pay for these when its only for use years later on) Buy now to let it rot?
 

Might as well keep the $$$ and invest it where it will grow. Then buy the house NEW when one retires and really wants to stay in JB then. It'll won't be too late then.....

i have purchase a terrace house in jb in 2004 and house ready in 2006 the place is Austin Perdana.. near to Tebrau City.. the price is RM285K and paid 40% deposit and loan the rest for 30 years monthly installment is RM1100. The main reason I purchased the house is not for investment or retirement ..it is more to convenience when doing my weekly marketing/shopping. what convenience? entering and getting out of jb of course.. previously come in sat morning and leaving the same day afternoon after shopping but actually most time spend stuck in the jam.. so with the weekend "chalet".. as stay in jurong enter friday night 9pm thru secondlink and sleep over till sunday and enter spore at about 2pm using causeway when traffic still not so bad. I do agree that the housing in jb is oversupply and if you buy make sure you use it and not just let it rot.

my advise when purchasing : make sure the developer is listed in KL stock exchange

some benefit : know jb roads like the back of your hand ..  after sat morning shopping.. afternoon is for finding road less travelled in johore... 1 tip simpang renggam is the place to buy CNY/Hari Raya cookies

Now's probably a good time to commit, since you frequent up north JB. The interest rates are very competitive (BLR at 5.55%) , the exchange rate is extremely favorable and because of the financial meltdown, developers are giving out a lot of freebies to sell. But it will be wise to buy those properties which have already been built and ready for occupation. Personally, I would want to enjoy the amenities and facilities NOW and not 10 or 20 years time (Nusajay region) as promised. And we are talking about properties and development across the causeway. No one knows what will happen in the future, by the time you are "ready" to go into full retirement, things would have changed a whole lot. Tebrau district (Austin Hills area) Skudai (Sutera Utama area) are regions where most hypermarkets / shopping / business / residential are already up in place. 
 

Hope this helps.

I SO SO SO AGREE that Buying A House In Johor is like Flushing away your $$$$
 

I personally own a landed property in Molek. in 10 years, I have 3 break in, last one in 2007 which left my whole house almost destroyed as the burglar tried to burn down my house to destroy evidence.
 

Unless you're going to stay now, why invest for retirement when the houses (FREEHOLD) is over-supply and will be over-supply for at least another few years.

Guarded compound or not? I have not heard of any break-in for Singaporean relatives'/Friends' houses that are guarded in JB. For those who don't know, in JB, cluster of more upmarket landed houses are usually fenced up and all entrance/exit are 24 x 7 guarded. You need access card or transponder to pass through the guarded gates.

Quite a good deal. Imagaine the local can purchase an apartment unit just next to Tebrau City for around RM150k! Really envy them. They are still people willing to pay a decent price for properities at good location in JB.
 

In fact, the developers are looking at the Iskandar project to add live to the property market in JB.

Quite true, the lesses is like King or Queen in JB. If you kena a lousy one, be prepared for a nasty tug-of-war liao. Hence, the reason why friends and relatives rather leave the house koso and just used it as a weekend getaway or short stay.

That RM250000 threshold refers to those who are retirees(mostly Europeans) living in M'sia under the MM2H scheme. Under the current scheme, they are (generally) allowed to purchase up to 2 properties above RM250K. This will most likely to be raised to RM500K, infact, in states like Selangor, Penang, these states will only approve of sales above RM500K.

More upmarket properties have better quality security guards. Some even employed grukhas. You could see them doing morning and evening parade at the guardhouse. They are not your typical, sloppy dressed condo security guards found in Singapore Condo .

Guys,
 

Got the keys to my home just 2 weeks ago. Terrace living with condo facilities...
 

All the applications eg bank loan, govt consent went without a hitch..
 

I do understand many are concerned on safety aspects etc 
 

To me, all areas have their fair share of criminal activities, even 1st world USA....so why condemn MY when there are locals like us migrating to US, Australia etc
 

US, Aust also do have cases of kidnappings, rape, murder, theft, shootings etc...
 

And am I wrong to classify the freehold property as an asset???

Basically a boutique hotel but some of the units are sold for private ownership. It is located in pulai spring golf club resort, maintenance is taken care of part of as part of the hotel, environment is a golf club resort with club facilities, golf course itself is also of world class standards.
 

definitely more expensive than some of the landed properties but answers the security issues, built quality, maintenance issues...

i also harbour the dream of having a house in JB and then retiring there, can easily travel to and fro singapore.  Somehow the slower pace life style, cheaper and nice food, lower cost of living makes it appealing, granted that security is one main concern.



 

I've got a friend's neighbour that is S'porean that stays in JB but works in S'pore. And yes, your $$ gets x2.5

I went to Mont Kiara recently, many nice residential development and construction going on there. Consider as one of the more upmarket properties down there.

Regards,



 

Mount kiara is where the expat schools are. Alot of supply now,in these 2 years, condo units grew from 5000 to 10000 units but demand is not there. Many old units are empty for months if buy for own stay still ok. KLCC, supply grew from 1000 units to 5000 units but many many empty units as well.So far looks to be a failure.Expensive but not popular.
 

Bukit Bintang has fixed supply,very little land to build new units. Demand are strong from expats because the pubs & resturant streets are popular.And  right in the middle of their CBD as well.

I just turned 40 and I bought a condo in JB last year to prepare for my retirement. I do this as JB is near and that's where I was born. (I have stayed in Singapore since 1983).
 

Not here to argue about security, ROI etc, just share my experience with TS:
 

For the price slightly more than a Japanese 2.0 car, I bought the condo without loan. Spent about another S$20K to do it up with whole house aircon, full appliance/furniture, built-in cabinets/kitchen, lighting etc. (I spent S$60K 3 years ago just just to do some renovation in my HDB without appliances/furniture).
 

I enjoyed the facility and used it as weekend holiday home for 6 months before renting it out to a Singaporean business man doing business in JB. After deducting maintenance and taxes, I get about 8% return/ year.
 

My consideration for choosing the location and where/what to buy are:
 

1. Ease of renting: a 2 bedroom apartment is easier to rent out compared to a 5 bedroom unit. Condo with facilities are preferred by middle class who are more likely to pay rent in time.

2. Developer: Compared to buying property in SG, choosing which developer to buy from is very very important in Malaysia, this has to do with weather your property will finally be built, and future maintenance, to what kind of development will be near by in the immediate future.

3. Neighborhood: Just like Singapore, Johor is segmented into different zones, expat community/ industry/ commercial/ residential etc. While the Government may have their plan in zoning, tried to assess them and ask yourself, will that happened? From my observation, zone are usually not planned or organised in Malaysia but rather slowly developed. E.g. When we bought our Mt Kiara condo almost 20 years ago, that place was not planned/organised as a expat zone, it was some how, the first 2 blocks of condo were all rented out to alot of korean and Jap as Mt Kiara wasn't in the CBD (= no jam) and closer to the factories where most expats work. And the fact that expats like to stay near to each other, the facilities slowly came: school, restaurant, cafe etc.
 

So far I have no security problems with the unit/area I've bought and I sort of enjoying the fact that not too overwhelming number of Singaporean have came to drive the price of properties skyhigh as compared to the other aspect of life in JB.

Question to all Bros out there - Now with the Prpoerty prices in SG like mad and car prices also joining soon - Do you all think it is worthwhile getting a place in JB to park some of your $$ for Investment purpose...
 

My scenario like this - got a little bit of $$ but still cannot buy property here (not enough leh) Crazy!
 

other options 
 

Keep in Bank - lagi crazy!!

Invest in Stock market - out of the question, I'll get high blood pressure and eventually heart attack 

Buy property in SG - Not enough $$ and out of the question, sell my HDB!! Howcan!

Buy Car - no point, just got one 2 yrs back 

Dun ask me to buy bank bonds and all that Lehman s--t!
 

was frequenting JB lately for shopping and food...and petrol...almost every week...kekkeek

and saw some nice places Horizon hil, bukit indah, austin hills tebrau...all nice places and near to ammenities....
 

so wondering if good to buy one small landed place and keep to stay for weedkend......but no prices all also sky high...but not as high as SG leh!!
 

So anyone out there got a place and is it worthwhile investiing in JB now???

wow - twice within the same year...screwed back and then front! s--t!
 

Anyway, are they still holding onor they have rented out?
 

But a lot of the houses nowadays comes with gated and guarded and if places like Horizon Hill, the security is pretty tight....I don't think it's easy to break in at places where there is Golf course, where the security is better.

probably open concept is a bit risky to get...
 

Anyway, cluster homes are now pretty expensive in JB - coz of the side land that they provide...
 

double storey landed in JB price range is around RM300-500

Cluster homes is around 500-600k

super link is around 600-800k 

semi d - no need to say

banglow - no need to smell lah..

all depending on location 
 

I find it a bit pricey already but still a lot cheaper than SG............!!!!
 

Any guru's out there that can share a thot?

I got a question - Can Sporean stay in JB permanently when we retire? and then rent out our HDB flats? 

the rental is good enough to cover our daily expenses in JB and provide a good positive cashflow!
 

i mean it's just an hrs drive with the jam (pessimistic a bit) if we want to come back for a visit...
 

got a little bit of land and can sit back and relax and enjoy the fresh air somewhere in the hills... 
 

is that a worthwhile thot??

Maybe I am biased but pls allow me to provide an alternative to Malaysia for retirement.
 

I have business in JKT, Indonesia so I have seen how the economy and property prices have been shooting up. Indonesia's economy is booming these past few years. Because they are a large country, they are not dependent on developments outside the country like many of her neighbours. Like the US, they produce and consume and frequently need to import to meet their demands. Normal bank interests for saving accounts are about 6% and up. FD can go up to almost 10% pa. Rupiahs do go up and down but generally its been constant these few years. Go have a look at some developments in Pantai Indah Kaput. My friend and his family stay there and their homes and shop houses have been going up up. 
 

I am not sure if Indonesia is the country I want to retire in but when I do decide in a couple more years' time, I will surely give it a look. JKT is only 1.5 hrs away by plane and you can fly return for S$130 including taxes. I will take JKT over JB anytime but that is a personal preference so pls dont blast me.

Thanks for the info bro Jason....

base on the info here, looks like a good portion here opted for HH...
 

Is it still a good buy there? I have been there once, on the way to Jusco for shopping - and enquired about the condo...i think the 1st tower was sold out and the 2nd tower was released -still have available units...

But the price difference btw the 1st tower and 2nd tower is like 100k RM....I find that rediculous!!! hence, didn't bother to ask....and the landed properties - they call it superlink were going from 750k nia!!! Is this still worth it???
 

Base on the data provided here, most of the ppl who invested in JB opted for landed - (correct me if I am wrong)...so I should target landed too right? it's a better choice right vs condo?
 

One other question, those who bought - are you staying there or rented out....and which is easier to rent? condo or house in jb?
 

I am thinking about my retirement - so my mind is on condo - small place and easy to maintain, then my heart is yearning for a landed...a place to do some gardening (you knowlah, here HDB, where got garden) craving for the landed feel...
 

I like HH too - near to checkpoint and 15 min you're back in SG...and all the facilities are there - but prices has risen too steep and too fast...

Same thoughts Bro - Bukit Indah and HH has increased a lot in prices - I was comparing the b/up space between Bukit India and other developments
 

Per sq feet - it is higher than the rest of the areas vs Austin, Tebrau area...
 

Anyone got a place there and rented it out - i need to know if it's easy to rent out in HH and Bukit Indah area? My fren here says it is very difficult, coz JB where got expat living there...no MNC no expat so no rental....rental in JB is only double storey house, that also difficult to get tenants if >2k a mth....std of living not highlah...most ppl earnign only a few k - and to pay rent of 2-5k...not many ppl can afford..
 

So?? but to stay ok....but to rent out...a bit difficult...according to my fren from JB...Is this true?

Yes I think the part about rental is true , unlike SG where you got more FTs than citizens . Very difficult to find a FTs in JB who can afford to rent a terrace at 3K lah . Their FTs there mostly wipe tables  , and clean toilets ones .  Not like SG , citizens wipe tables , FTs stay in terrace houses .  :angry: 

Anyway prices are very high in most area around stated in the list simply because the quality/location of the houses are quite good one. If you want good one , be prepared to pay more lor.

though is a lawless corrupt place with abundant low cost labor to do business.. is 1.5hrs correct, the riots of 97 is still very fresh on my mind, the underground air tics price tat time was 1000USD just to sg, chinese u either pay or we whack you till dead, even have air tics u know the road sukarno hatta airport which is beside padi fields to the airport are blocked by thugs, robbers, rapist (err part time job of the local police) waiting to ambush you there ,, u can bring your gold bars but the thugs waiting there, the banks are being smashed by stones from the looters...
 

if you are there, just advice you to plunder the country and take your riches to singapore, like all the corrupt officials as no extradition treaty, den wire transfer to swiss bank UBS secret swiss account etc lah haha..

Most of the Chinese Indonesians are very rich . They always want to leave their country because they are targeted almost everyday.

though is a lawless corrupt place with abundant low cost labor to do business.. is 1.5hrs correct, the riots of 97 is still very fresh on my mind, the underground air tics price tat time was 1000USD just to sg, chinese u either pay or we whack you till dead, even have air tics u know the road sukarno hatta airport which is beside padi fields to the airport are blocked by thugs, robbers, rapist (err part time job of the local police) waiting to ambush you there ,, u can bring your gold bars but the thugs waiting there, the banks are being smashed by stones from the looters...
 

if you are there, just advice you to plunder the country and take your riches to singapore, like all the corrupt officials as no extradition treaty, den wire transfer to swiss bank UBS secret swiss account etc lah haha..

what about the new iskander area



 

too early to tell..the area is heavily promoted by vested investors so most will tell u its good..capital appreciation(if any) will be negated by the interest charged on the loans..buy only if u got spare cash to pay in full or can afford to let that property sit there

HH is already full. If interested you can try Bukit Indah. Still within your budget.

Cluster homes are not cheap.  They are just like semi-detached, just that there is also an immediate neighbor behind.  If you want a landed property in Horizon Hills, there are still a small number within your budget.  This resale terrace house is about 460k MYR:

But an intermediate terrace house at Horizon Hills probably does not have a lawn, except the tiny patch of grass outside the gate.
 

There are lots of speculators (some might prefer to call them investors......) in that area, so you can see people selling houses they have never occupied.

Not really , I think the side garden land is about 5 fts wide .  They normally built full height side doors and window along the side garden which let in a lots of lights , and more windy too .  You will have a squarish hall instead of the usual long deep and dark hall like those intermediate terrace . Developer actually can built less houses on the same plot of land which explain why they are selling higher price for custer house.

By the way, Nusa Duta, which is also a gated housing area, should have cheaper houses.  It is a small housing estate, does not have as much green space as Horizon Hills has, and is sandwiched between Perling and Nusa Bestari II, with an entrance I do not quite like, but it seems pretty popular.  Its resale cluster homes are quite close to your budget:
 

http://www.tophills.com.my/Property.aspx?S...ord=nusa%20duta
 

When the coastal highway is completed at the end of this year or early next year, it will be about 15 minutes from both the causeway and the second-link.  Its entrance is less than one kilometer from one of the coastal highway interchanges.

If I am not wrong Nusa Duta also sold out all of its terrace and custer houses liao . Most likely can only buy re-sale lah .

I think @ 920K is crazy . It was only around 400K 3 yrs ago ! Best is you dont need to wait for construction , walk in selection . Now a day become BTO

Thanks Bros... 
 

just keeping the options open, but yeah hh is really a nice place and pay a premium for it...
 

there are also the other places - which i was looking at Tebrau...not so pricey as HH, but still not bad...near probably easier to rent out coz near to amenities too - jusco, giant, and the rest....
 

Thinking if can rent out for 1/2 the instalment, then the balance cover for the next 30 yrs or so...then can have my retirement home.... 

2k instalment - if can rent for 1k, then the other one 1k top up...good enough!

Bros , just my view .  Try hunting around Nusajaya area , Kota Iskandar, Medini  area ... it is the in thing now in JB. That explain why price is up so much as compare to other parts of JB .

Agree to look elsewhere other than HH, remember, Malaysia is good in building, getting the "software/people" to sustain them is another question. Safer to look around more established areas with ready amenities which are already populated.   , without paying an arm and a leg for it.

Hi All,
 

I am intending to buy an apartment in JB as well. 
 

Most probably in NusaJaya's area. 
 

I have heard that the minimum investing for foreigner is 500,000RM.
 

I have seen people telling me it is 250,000RM.
 

May I know which is which?
 

Anything I need to watch out for when I buy an apartment in JB?
 

I intending to work in Singapore but buy an apartment there.
 

Thank you.

^^Minimum is now RM500k.
 

Instead of an apartment, I suggest a small terrace or semi-D. Why settle for a pigeon hole in the sky in MY where land is abundant? Most importantly is to buy into a gated and guarded community from a reputable developer. You should go visit and read up on this thread in SB and do your own homework and due diligence:

go seach in the iproperty website...all info is there, only depend what type of house/condo you looking for...

Bank,legal...once you find one ...the rest are almost the same....
 

Wahhh...better still if GF is Msian - can buy below <500k....but risk she run away with the house...kekek....kidding! 

that's one option - actually I am in the same boat as you .....at 1st have to buy >500k house...but in the end settled for less as and got a corner house somemore....there are values in JB properties....you need to search harder..

Hi All,
 

Anyone actually have an apartment in JB can advice me?
 

I need to buy the apartment there under my parents' name. 
 

Because my HDB MOP hasnt complete.
 

Can my mother age 69 take 80% finance loan from the banks there since the apartment we buying is not gonna run away?
 

After calcuating all the misc charges and 20% downpayment, I need to prepare around - breakdown.
 

55k For State Levy, Developer side stamp duty of 25k, Bank stamp duty of 15k, state level for another 15k. 
 

If i would to buy an apartment for 530,000 RM, 

20% of it cost 106000 RM
 

55k RM + 106k RM = 161k RM
 

Divided by 2.4 will be 67K Singapore Dollars..
 

that is pretty much..

Unlikely to get a loan under your parent since she is already 69 yrs , max limit is 70 yrs in malaysia . Further more , mostly likely she does not have a stable income right ?

To bypass the problem , you can buy using her name but loan financing under your name , all problem solved , BINGO ! thks to papies flaw polices.

Oh Ok..
 

So that can be done? House under her name and I finance under mine.
 

I dont mind doing that. 
 

But 65k for a start to buy an apartment in JB is rather costly as well..

One thing to note though.... even thou the houses prices are relatively cheap but the bank is not low on the interest. do do your homework before choosing which bank. for foreigner you have to include MRTA as well. meaning you got to go for a medical checkup. Agewise, you can stretch to 70 years old for loan but not advisable cause the interest can get you another unit and half.
