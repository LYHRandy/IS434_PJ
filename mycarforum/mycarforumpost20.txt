My family is looking to purchase a 2nd-hand landed property for investment purpose and I'm the guy appointed to do all the grunt work...   ie, I need to do the search and shortlisting. 
 
Criteria is this : 
- Within 400m of MRT station (existing or constructing)
- Freehold or 999 years
- If 3-storey, below $1,100 psf (land)
- If 2-storey, below $900 psf (land)- Budget of $X million. (enough for terrace or small Semi-D. Don't wanna state the value here cos scared get sarcastic remarks)
 
I been looking at propertyguru and its been tough as most listings don't state their exact location.
 
How should I go about my search? I was thinking to just send out my above criteria to 20 agents who do landed property sales and get them to search for me. 
 
Any important pre-viewing criteria I missed out? I have another long set of checkboxes for viewing.
 
Seeking opinions from gurus please.

Region is not part of my criteria. 
But I have a preference. Currently staying at Ang Mo Kio, so nearby there would be good.

They don't state the exact location, but they state the road names, so why not go to the map to take a look? If not, just call the agent and fix an appt to view the place.

Since you have already stated within 400m of MRT station. 
You can then map out the properties yourself. 
Then you could tabulate the properties in the locale by price/size/type.
 
Volvo just gave the most important piece of advice. Drive around, walk around the neighborhood. If you see FW beer parties or houses used as FW dorms...
Any makan places nearby? How far to expressway? How many expressway?
A payoff is that you might be able to spot MCF premium member houses, all the ponies and Buffaloes.
The weather, the other residents. 
For example if I like the retro sixties look for my neighborhood, so it's quite easy to find. Tip, near that lotus showroom area.
 
My suggestion is to know the neighborhood before viewing the house. You know lah, property agent is the same family as cars salesman....your own due diligence.
Speak with the neighbors. Surreptitiously ask the police if they need to patrol that neighborhood frequently for say illegal parking.
 
Saying the price means to me that you might not be serious buyer.
or that you are limiting yourself prematurely.
 
Cheers

All land within 400m of a mrt station is usually zoned for plot ratio 3 and abv. The bare land alone will easily be worth 2k psf. Even the amber rd compensation case .. SLA offerred 1050 psf for compensation. 
Use propertyguru app... U can view by MAP. That will show listing proximity to mrt stations. 
 
But based on your criteria, other than psf... U can look at bishan, springleaf, or the upcoming eastern mrt line route.

Many of them quite far away, but appears in my 500M search criteria.

Go call up the agents in propertyguru, sure can find one lah ...

Else, go to the area that you are looking at, surf the neighbourhood, and sure find one house that have the agent name, call him ...

Bellboy, why must your landed be within 400M of MRT?
 
Landed owners do not consider proximity to MRT as very important.

Generally landed near MRT better be fenced.  
Illegal parking is going to be a big headache. Unless don't drive.

Finding the exact location of the property on propertyguru is simple, just call the agent of the house you're interested in and ask them. Done it many times before and only had a few rejections. Bro seriously if you're coming here to ask us to propertyguru and search for you (on your generic criteria's) I can say most of us have better things to do.
 
Go down see an actual property you are interested in take notes and anything you feel is out of the ordinary then post some specific question. Heck bring your family down, bring a feng shui master down, don't worry about wasting agent's time if you're serious.

A simple question. Why does co-broking shortchange the buyer and seller?
ok i share personal experience.
 
Viewed a place many many years ago when still greenhorn and put trust in Agents.
As a buyer, i bumped into an agent (A) who offered to help me look.
decided to make a bid on a place solely marketed by Agent B.
 
Agent A said he will help me make a bid as he is capable, skilled etc etc etc..
I agreed (big mistake) out of kindness.
 
Asking price was $1.13mil from Agent B. 
I said i will consider and offer.
I told A to go in at $1.15mil to SEAL the deal.
He said no problem.
 
A week later, A said, no deal, asking now at $1.2mil
Of course I told him forget it.
 
Later on, i found out that deal was indeed sealed at $1.13mil
 
I realised that two things could have most likely happened.
 
1. Agent A didnt make the offer becos he wanted to sell me something he was marketing to get full comms instead of splitting with B
 
Or
 
2. Agent B didnt show the owner the check for $1.15mil and took a lower offer at $1.13mil becos she wanted to keep full comms from seller instead of splitting with A.
 
So who got screwed?
Seller and buyer.
Seller got at lower price and buyer (me) couldnt seal the deal he wanted.
 
Lesson learned hard way.
All for being kind.

Want a landed house, but gonna rent it out at least for the next 10 years. Thats why need to be near MRT. Along with MRT, other amenities will also naturally come, making it attractive for tenants. 
Call any agent with any landed property listed. Go and view the house. Then after that just tell agent your criteria of that house doesn't fit. The agent will source for co broking deals... Sure can find one...
 
That was my question in the first place; should I do that.

Landed house is for staying.
Not for renting or investment.
Yield too low and capital gains today are a big question.
But luckily prices are easily 10% lower than a year or two ago.
Take note that the rent collected is NOT going to cover your mortgage unless you down at least 50 %

I feel you...  
Only by representing yourself, can you best protect your interest. Basic knowledge of laws and regulations required though.
 
For the selling agent, i have seen some good marketing work done by them for landed homes and sometimes, it may be worth it in the bear market

Agreed . Landed rental yield is quite low. Investment wise, you need to have a pretty long term view, at least 10 years given the current market outlook. However I am a firm believer of landed for the long term.

Not really desirable for families with teenagers or school kids in general. Unless the kids are old enough to drive and parents can/willing to buy a ride for every kids, else the poor kids have to walk home from nearest bus stop every day under hot sun like now.

My family is looking to purchase a 2nd-hand landed property for investment purpose and I'm the guy appointed to do all the grunt work...   
ie, I need to do the search and shortlisting. 
 
Criteria is this : 
- Within 400m of MRT station (existing or constructing)
- Freehold or 999 years
- If 3-storey, below $1,100 psf (land)
- If 2-storey, below $900 psf (land)
- Budget of $X million. (enough for terrace or small Semi-D. Don't wanna state the value here cos scared get sarcastic remarks)
 
I been looking at propertyguru and its been tough as most listings don't state their exact location.
 
How should I go about my search? I was thinking to just send out my above criteria to 20 agents who do landed property sales and get them to search for me. 
 
Any important pre-viewing criteria I missed out? I have another long set of checkboxes for viewing.
 
Seeking opinions from gurus please.  

 
i think the first thing you need to do is at least determine the area you are looking for... though you are looking to rent out but i am sure the investment is more for the land rather than renting out.... renting is just a subset of your investment.....
 
not sure why you are willing to pay more for land for a 3 story house than a 2 story house if the land is same size...
 
also you must consider renovated or original.... who do you intend to rent out to? Corporates, FTs or FWs or even locals?
 
beside MRT, you must also consider what is available in the surrounding area... HDBs, coffeeshops, shopping malls, etc.........

When it comes to landed can't really just asses overall price on land size, if one is really buying for the land the house has to be so old or badly maintained that even tenants will reconsider (i,e total tear down). 
 
Rebuilding a house would be anywhere from 850k - 2m (varies alot pending on built in area, no of stories, materials used etc), if you had two houses on the same size land side by side and one had a built up of 2.5k and another one had 5k no way would the larger house sell for the same price as the former. I doubt TS is looking too rebuild the house hence the willingness to pay more for a 3 story
 
I'm seen a house which is a total rebuild, they were still using those bakelite switches, alternative buyers/tenants would be anyone into the retro look and prefer natural cooling > Air con
