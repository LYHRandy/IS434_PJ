First, identify the normal path the rat uses.
 

Then get a piece of cardboard smear rat glue( you can get it from hardware shops for $5) on it.
 

Place the trap on the path ( narrow it down so that it has to walk on the trap).
 

Then wait. If you're crule enough, smack the fella when you catch it.

Try to use the sticky platform. Rats nowadays are quite smart, its no longer easy to use the traditional rat-trap.
 

Its been effective for my use so far. Caught one, the rest dun dare come liao.

the bro's here are right, use dried cuttlefish with the trap, very effective.
 

glue traps can be found in most supermarkets, and i think Daiso also sell for $2.  haven't seen that in action before.  again put a nice smelly bait on it.
 

traditional way of killing after capture is to... drown it...

buy the glue from any hardware shop,
 

use the glue to apply on some cardboard with cuttelfish like some bro said
 

pest controller teach me to put it at corner of wall or by side of wall, rat use their whisker (or whatever it calls) to brush around the wall to put signal for their kind as indicators..
 

btw i saw rat jump 1 metre + across from a DB box  to another table platform before..commando sia!

I used to keep pet white mice - was all cool until one day caught house mouse, put it in same cage as existing two - do you have any idea how quickly the population increases then?  I sure do, after first litter appear was increase like nobody business.  Ended up I got rid of all of them.  First try to drown - throw in bucket of water and try to hold down with ice cream container...until they all swam underneath and started climbing sides of container - damn smart little buggers.  
 

Ended up picking up by tail and then beating brains against a fence post....

I tried using biscuit as bait, on rat glue applied on cardboard. Managed to catch 6 of them. 
 

Drowning them using hot water quite effective. 
 

Have seen someone put caught rat in a big plastic and hold it at car exhaust using the fumes to kill it.

Me too. One sure way of killing the rats is by "roasting" them using fire after they were caught.

Contrary to popular believe cheese isn't the first choice of rats or mice. Cuttlefish works well, as mentioned, and also coconut (cut into pieces exposing the white flesh inside the shell).

Use cutterfish as bait strong smell and very tough once the rat bite and pull it is easier to set off the trap.



 
 
 

yap. dried cutterfish is the best bait. i ever ask a few pest control friends and they all told me the same thing... before you go to bed...get those black colour sticky pest glue and apply on a piece of 2'x2' plywood (cardboard too light, the trapped rat may cause a mess to your house while trying to escape). get some cuttlefish and try to bbq it a bit using a lighter so that the smell is spread far far... the rat confirm come at night...

now that is downright disturbing. Beating your pet mice brains against a fence post. I think it would have been better if you just feed them some rat poison. how could you bear to do that to your pet mice?

burning them is too cruel, just drown them in water till they die. when the water bubbles from their nose or mouth, that mean they die already..

different ma..  

pests like rats always like to shiit everywhere and hard to catch if pet still can train but pests how to train and we cannot control their population.
 

if dont do anything to stop these pests our home sure smell like garbage bin.

nibble clothes until got hole and even like to steal rice and s--t and live in the bucket of rice. 

some even like to eat wood.

trained pets where got do all these one. 
 

i'm quite sure myself if the rats in my backyard are harmless, i will leave them alone.

but they even steal my jack's food. and my jack gets very angry. haha.
