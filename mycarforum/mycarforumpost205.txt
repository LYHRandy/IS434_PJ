If money is not an issue, just go for it. If u can save 1 hour on travelling everyday, one year u can have at least

extra 52weeks X 5 hours = 260hours.  . U can make use of the extra free time to upgrade yrself to

earn more money or have more rest time.

But what if you change job? Unless you are sure you will work at CBD for the considerable future. In any case, its still not too far. In most other countries, 20-40km will be considered sururban area.

i wont coz now i am opposite  

ask me go stay jurong? no way sia. the traffic jam from jurong to town is also one kind in the early morning. it works gd if yr wking place is against the 'normal' heavy traffic conditions. 
 

however if u mentioned abt yr situation, i will stay put coz i think 3room flats r too small if u have family etc.

plus jurong opening up also, will have more job offers? can keep a lookout so u wk nearby

Visiting relatives during CNY is a once a yr affair isn't it? How tiring can it be. Most gatherings, events and functions take place in town a lot more frequently. I loved the convenience of attending wedding functions and shopping in town which is just a stone throw away from home.

The place I'm staying at currently, takes me less than 5min to walk to MRt and 15min ride to raffles place.. but if driving, takes 25min to reach raffles place bec Nicole Highway packed by cars coming out of KPE. If I'm spending 25min driving a 10km distance which I started driving at 815 to reach office by 9am, then those staying at West, North etc will spending maybe 45min for a 20km journey...

No.  Singapore already so crowded, squeeze in the streets, squeeze in the city, come home liao still want to squeeze meh?  No lah, I rather live more humanely.
 

I heard 3 room HDB at those old tiong bahru/tanglin halt/commonwealth neighborhood is only 500 or 600 sq ft nia.... How to live sia...... And so expensive some more...
 

I mean, if you drive to work anyway, why not live in a more spacious HDB flat that is further away?
 

I have a friend who lives in a 5 room HDB in choa chu kang, wah his flat is very spacious.... Corner unit some more, nearest neighbor is one corridor away.... Really good living conditions for the amount of money paid. For the same amount last time, he could only afford a small 3 or 4 room HDB in more central location.. To him, space was more important than location...

I have been to some of the 40 year old HDB flats in the central area.  Some flats have the urine and faeces smell along the corridor, seems that the older flats have poorer ventilation.

In the long term, location is very important. Especially when we are gearing for 7m population where most of the pple will have to stay further from central.
 

500-600 sqft can be comfortable, depending how many people is staying inside. If it is just 2 person (a couple), I don't see the problem.
 

I would assume that the TS has already assess how many pple is staying in the smaller house. So I guess if he starts this thread, he would have found the smaller house acceptable for the number of pple staying inside.
 

Depending on the interior design and reno, 500-600 sqfeet  can be made very optimal for comfortable living. I have seen more "spacious" shoeboxes due to optimal interior design than a 4-rm HDB which is cluttered and not so well thought off in terms of furniture and storage layout.
