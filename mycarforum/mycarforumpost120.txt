My parents is selling their flat, and wanting to buy another new one. They are second timer.
 

I understand that Singaporeans can most buy new flat twice.
 

Can any share, can they view the available areas, ask for the price at HDB before they decide?
 

What other procedure needed. Thanks for any advise!

nowadays new flats either are BTOs, DBSS or SBF(sale of balance flats)..the latest SBF was just over last month..BTO have to pay $10 fee to ballot for queue number..DBSS can just walk in to select..i not sure what u mean by viewing areas(u mean viewing actual site?)..can view through the HDB website when its launched for the locations/units/types/prices and maybe u go down HDB hub at tpy to see the models and materials..fyi 2nd timers hdb only set aside 5% for BTO..easier to get DBSS

iirc, levy only for sales from purchase with govt subsidy only.
 

so if you bought first flat without subsidy, then dun have to pay levy when you sell it.

Wrong.  Levy payable for first flat direct from hdb if the second flat to be purchased is direct from hdb... regardless whether first flat direct from hdb has housing grant or not.

Very simple. When HDB conduct exercise, just submit yr application and pay $10 which is non-refundable. Then wait for their letter to see if u hv been selected to book a flat.

Price wise, u can find out fm their web site for guide price.

Yes, was told to pay the levy for a 5 room flat of $45k . IF your application successful then you sell your existing flat.
 

If you sell your flat before applying the second one, no need to pay the levy.

You bought a resale unit in the first place, no Gov grant so you need need pay back any levy.
 

If you happen to upgrade one day, buying a new HDB flat directly from HDB, you will have the grant. But when you sell it after five years and wanting to buy another new flat from HDB, you have to pay the levy.
 
 

Correct me if I am wrong.

Still need to pay levy as long as you apply for new flats as second timer, doesn't matter
 

whether you sell your 1st flat before or after you apply. 
 

As long as apply for second new flat and when they got it, the levy will come in.
 

The only way to escape the levy is to buy resale HDB or new DBSS.

Was in HDB hub in the morning.
 

The officer told me, second timer buying a new HDB flat directly from HDB.
 

1. Sell your flat before you buy the second one, NO NEED PAY LEVY.
 

2. Buy a new one and get your key, then sell your existing one, MUST PAY!
 

Seems that many people got other opinion, but mine is from a HDB officer. So I assumed won't goes wrong.

For your 1st point, it is No need pay levy at the moment. The levy will come in when second HDB flat is purchased new. 
 

You can sell the flat first, after few years later buy another new HDB flat. There will be levy + interest .
 

Think you better called again to check. I check with few different HDB CSO at HDB Hub and got different answers.
 

That's when I spoke to their supervisor and got a better understanding.

But the officer told me, you sell before you get your new key, the LEVY not payable. ( who knows you succeed on the application or not)
 

And if you sell after your new key arrive, you need to pay the levy accordingly.
 

 Maybe someone who work in this line can advice further. I sit and talk to the officer, and I don't think I heard wrongly and I am not saying you are wrong too.
 
 

Confusing!

Levy thing cnfm must pay. Am guessing the officers made an assumption that sellers may change their mind and buy re-sale.

But if apply and get new flat fm HDB, they wl trawl back the levy with interest.

BUT, if buy DBSS, they wl waive off the levy, which is stated clearly when they start marketing the DBSS project.

You can ask your parents to go down to the HDB Branch office to check the amount of levy payable
 

if buying a second new flat from HDB. HDB Branch office and NOT HDB hub.

The HDB web site is a guide line and it's better to check with the HDB branch office 
 

on the exact figure of levy. That's what my property agent advice me.

Previously they went by % of re-sale price, after that they switched to fixed rate.

New rates dependant on when re-sale transaction was submitted, not when it was bought.

Not really escape paying levy, just avoid it by buying re-sale or DBSS, which is really crazy price.

Actually if think of it:
 

1. BTO: need to pay levy, must be in cash also if not mistaken. Also only 5% set aside for 2nd timer, so probability of getting it is pretty low.
 

2. Dbss: no need levy but price is so freaking expensive.
 

3. Resale: no need levy but need to fork out minimally cov in cash. Highest bidder wins.
 

End of the day, see which one fits u best.. Also must consider waiting time. BTO and Dbss, need to wait but resale can be chop chop.

am i a first timer or second timer ? need to pay any levy or not ? before or after allocation of new flat ?
 
coz i am actually thinking of joining the next exercise ...
 
and lets say if i sell my 3rm for 300k and a new 4rm only 290k ... can i use the sales from my 3rm to pay in full for the 4rm ?

Question 1:
First-timer Applicants
You and the essential family members listed in the application for purchase of the flat must not:
Be the owners of a flat bought direct from HDB, a DBSS flat or an Executive Condominium bought from the developer
Have sold a flat bought direct from HDB, a DBSS flat or an Executive Condominium bought from the developer
Have received the CPF Housing Grant for the purchase of an HDB resale flat
Have taken other forms of housing subsidy (for example, benefitted under the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme, privatisation of HUDC estate etc)
Question 2:
Resale Levy
The Resale Levy/Premium is payable by flat owners who had previously sold a flat bought directly from the HDB or a resale flat bought with a CPF Housing Grant. It is applicable if you are buying your next flat from HDB or an EC where the land sale was launched on or after 9 Dec 2013.
 
Question 3:
Sales Proceed
Sales Proceed Calculator is available in HDB website, you can use it to calculate the estimated cash you can get from selling your home.
 
http://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BB24SaleProceedCalculator/BB24SSaleProceedsCalc?pageName=home&loanTag=H
 
If you are applying for second HDB loan:
If you plan to apply for a second HDB concessionary rate loan, do note that the loan amount has to be reduced by using your full CPF proceeds and part of the cash proceeds from the sale of your current or immediate past HDB flats. You can keep the greater of $25,000 or half of the cash proceeds. The HDB will take into account the remaining part of the cash proceeds when determining the amount of the second loan to be granted to you.
 
Hope the above helps. Call HDB or make a trip down and they will assist you in the above. Best to get confirmation from them.

For yr last question, using sales from 3rm ($300k) to pay in full for 4rm ($290k) ... I dun tink it is possible becos u haven factor other misc expenses e.g. stamp duty, admin fees, etc... (not inclusive of any other levy yet)... unless u have a lot of CPF to cover any difference.
