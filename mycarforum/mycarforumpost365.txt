Just got a letter for revision of home loan interest rates (3.0 to 3.5%) 
 

I'm thinking of doing a repricing.
 

But should I go for floating 0.75% + SIBOR rates (revised every 3months) (1yr locked in)
 

OR
 

1% + SIBOR rates (capped at 1.49% if SIBOR goes high) (locked in 3yrs)
 

Any suggestions?

 today newspaper say foreign banks paying higher than sibor for S$ deposit. Maybe they don have enough S$ to conduct their business so better stock up. Maybe they expect sibor to go beyond what they offering to these depositors.

Sibor to hit more than 2% by end-2016: OCBC
 
http://www.straitstimes.com/business/banking/sibor-to-hit-more-than-2-by-end-2016-ocbc?xtor=CS3-20
 
Homeowners with home loans pegged to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (Sibor) could be paying much more this time next year.
 
OCBC is forecasting that the three-month Sibor - to which many mortgage rates are pegged - could double and hit more than 2 per cent by the end of next year.
 
 
Sibor is influenced by US Federal Reserve rates and the Singapore dollar strength, among other factors.
 
OCBC Bank's head of treasury research and strategy, Ms Selena Ling, told The Straits Times: "Persistent market speculation of further Monetary Authority of Singapore easing, given dovish growth and subdued inflation and a strong US dollar, will translate to greater pressure on Singapore-dollar short-term rates, especially the Swap Offer Rate. Sibor will also tend to follow with a lag."
 
Ms Ling said at an OCBC Bank 2016 Outlook Briefing yesterday the Fed is likely to raise rates by at least 1 to 1.25 percentage points by late next year. In its November meeting minutes released last week, the Fed hinted strongly it will next month make its first rate hike in about a decade. Ms Ling said the economy could see a "slow growth range" of between 2 and 3 per cent" for this year and next year.
 
Rate hikes and China's slowing growth would have already been taken into account in the growth numbers. Old growth engines, such as manufacturing, would remain in the doldrums, but new engines of growth, like financial services and information and communications technology, are coming on stream.
 
Although core inflation could be fairly subdued next year, do not expect persistent deflation, she said .
 
OCBC Bank head of research Carmen Lee said Singapore equities, which have not been performing very well this year, could get cheaper next year, with a price-to-earnings forecast of 12.1 times.
 
Since the financial crisis in 2008, the market has been trading at an average of 14 to 15 times earnings.
 
Expect to see high net worth investors looking into Singapore stocks too, Ms Lee added.
 
Volatility is still going to be very much in play and the whole region is still very much dependent on China.
 
Expect slower growth in the banking sector, and the property sector to remain challenging with the current cooling measures.
 
Healthcare could be one sector to look out for although valuations are expensive, Ms Lee said. She also noted Reits have been corrected since July and are yielding close to 7 per cent. She said: "December will taper off but it could also be a good time to accumulate some of the quality stocks."

at this time where every investments becomes vague, and the world finance is not very positive . . .
those capital ventures will scavenge any reasons just to justify for their prices hikes . . . including banks
honestly, the hype of US adjusting rates started early this year.
to date, it has been postponed again while the presidential transition is early next year . . .
yet, many banks had already adjusted their rates . . .
 
now, they even 'play up' other financial setbacks, countries' slowdowns, other requirements as stated (since the abovementioned is no longer justifiable) just to justify for the hike.  its obvious coz other revenues depleted, so raise interest rates lohhhhh . . . . 
 
simple, if there's suddenly a change on the current financial directives, will the banks readjust the rates or reverse the sibor numbers...... Fat Hope!
 
its no point saying 'dun loan lohhh' . . .
why would he/she not clear the bank loan if he/she can afford for a bigger loan???
its just too bad that locals have not much options and bank choices . . .
 
I guess what's worth discussing here is various options when refinancing your loan:- continue with variable rates on the 3mth sibor locking for 1 yr
- start with variable rates on the 3mth sibor locking for 2 yr
- go with fixed rates on 2 yrs lock, and refinance again  . . . .
- stick to fixed rates on 5 or 10yrs lock . ..
- are there any other options???
 
which one will you choose & why???

OCBC and Citibank are the worst of the lot. They can change loan conditions at whim and may not stick to original terms. If can avoid do try to avoid them. Now its just justifying their rates.

When/If Sibor hits 2%, the going is going to get rough. Those renting with yield 3.5%,  go negative cash flow. Those with million dollar loan, looking at $4K a mth. Lose tenant or job, buay tahan.

oh , isnt it too late to worry about it? For those which has consistently boasted that they actually "saved" taking a floating loan would now be worried as the credit cycle shifts towards a tightening lending requirements and raise interest rates.
 
What u guys should do now is actually to think about how to actually reduce damage by first locking in your loan interest and second securing your tenants for at least the upcoming 2 years.
 
As china RMB devalues itself in near future , we might see futher inflations coming from goods , indirectly benefiting the consumers but indirectly the biggest exporter is also the biggest consumer at least for us.
 
The positives is , demand changes to real demand .
 
As reduction in foreign investors/speculators would mean prices of properties is on real demand/supply status , rentals would probably remain stable if not better to the people renting thus curbing property speculations as restrictions on foreigners on rental. This is likely to reduce supply of the rental units.
 
Banks is likely to face a reduction in liquidity but to me i think is for the better as loose credit conditions is slowly getting controlled.

When the banks tell you SIBOR rising, do you think they are telling you better don't borrow, or do you think they are asking you to switch to fixed rates?
 
And if you agree with me that they are asking you to switch to fixed rates, it tells you their confidence in the  SIBOR level in the long run.
 
For your reference: both banks previously switched rates without anything close to a warning.

If they are actually trying to "frighten" people to convert , they would have done it long ago.
 
Bank strategies has being laid out long long time ago and any hikes in interest would long be discussed in meetings with the policy makers.
 
For your info , this clause is already around more than 15 years ago. Only local banks try not to adjust for various reasons. Revaluations and hiking of interest rates without notice has being around long long time ago.
 
In loan agreements, the parties are free to insert an interest rate adjustment clause that entitles the bank to step up interest rates following an increase in refinancing costs.
 
It would be silly for someone which is above 35 to even blame the two banks in the picture for doing such a thing when you will be aware that such a thing actually happened before. You know how to make money , the banks don't? Try telling the petrol companies not to charge so much on petrol despite the low crude prices.
 
Anyway what do a table wiper know , u guys should do due dillengence and do your own knowledge finding.

i switched to a floating loan based on sibor just last month. Cos the bank I'm with uses a board rate for their "fixed" loan. Anyway the repricing of a fixed loan after 2-3 years tend to be more expensive than even my current loan.
I'd rather take a more transparent loan pegged to SIBOR.

Well done. Great choice, even though you just can't shake off the insecurity I admit. In other words, got to pay more to get the sense of security that OCBC heads are "selling".

no expert lah. just that my loan is not high quantum, so no attractive rates available. And I'm still stuck with the bank until next year or else i need to payback the legal subsidy i got earlier on.
 
Just trying to ameliorate the initial mistake i made in 2010. That time noob and i was really rushed for time, so signed up without knowing what questions to ask. Thought i knew enough when i made the decision, but in retrospect was a poorer decision.
 
My quantum is not huge, so not a biggie lor.

The finance girl strongly suggested i reprice back to a fixed rate (which I'm already on)
But after discussing with my sister and my wife, decided to reprice to a floating pegged on SIBOR.

my personal gut feel is that the Fed will not be as aggressive as what some of the bears expect over 2016.
 
When sibor rose up past 1%, the local banks were very aggressive on locking people into fixed rates. But I'm just a contrarian.

Better use industry wide sibor which is transparent than some board rate set up by banks . 
Remember that banks are out there to make $$, and more $$ ! 
They will up rates once you get hook and there is nothing you can do about it ! 
If possible lock in some fix rates.. Believe recently there bank offering fix rate of 1.68% 2 yrs ! 
DYODD n Gd luck 
Spore MAS already jumping ahead of interest rate curve n encourage higher rates lor.. Banks making more $ !!

Boondocks
The boondocks is an American expression that stems from the Tagalog word bundok. It originally referred to a remote rural area, but now it is often applied to an out-of-the-way city or town considered backwards and unsophisticated.

US interest rate may rise faster than expected, according to Goldman Sachs.   US economy is 70% domestically driven, so once the Americans start to open their wallets, it can be quite a juggernaut but many also believe US cannot afford to raise rates by much due to their mountains of debts.  We live in interesting times whereby Dow Jones often falls on positive US economic data, how screw up can that be?

err bro, TS asked this 3 years (Jan 2012)  ago. And if he did took a fix rate at that time (1% + SIBOR, cap at 1.49% for 3 years), he would have missed out the much lower variable rate package (0.75%+SIBOR). By Jan 2015, 3-month sibor is just 0.46%, so the variable package is actually better for that 3 years.

Why huh?
Hi Sister @Pinobii, indeed a 0.25% raise is interest rates represent an increase in 45 billion of payments made due to increased interest alone through the debts owed by US Govt. But the payment also goes back in part to their people which can be stimulatory in nature through stimulating spending and increasing the ability of the Govt to loan more thereafter. Recently, the debt ceiling was raised to facilitate this.
 
But to go up a full percent represents an increase in 180 billion paid out annually on top of the existing rates. But increase they must, as it will be a huge strike against confidence if they don't. But given what we understand about their culture, it should take a long time to get there to a full percent, provided they have the strong will to get there even years later. And as confidence gets boosted, you can be sure US Govt will loan more. 
 
This is my personal interpretation only.

180 billion is barely 1% of a 18.1 trillion economy.  Higher growth / taxes will pay for it but confidence is priceless.

As recently as 2 weeks ago, OCBC and UOB were offering fixed first 2 yr rates at 1.68% but I think it has been withdrawn by now.
 
Maybe can wait the next promo but shld be higher abit but my take is if fixed first 2 yr rates are reasonable, can opt for that. 3rd yr maybe higher but you can do some partial repayment and also re-nego with the bank during the 3rd year but you normally can't re-finance with another bank until after the 3rd year.

One year's fiscal deficit is about half a trillion. 
 
http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/15/us-usa-budget-idUSKCN0S92K920151015#lEZI0zrudkAsXJda.97
 
How does one get to 18 trillion? What does this tell about their culture? 
 
18 trillion may be one year's GDP only, something like 56K USD per capita. But this amount assumes all the non working persons like children and retirees are contributing 56K.
 
180 billion may be just 1% of the GDP but it's 4-6 months of budget deficit. If they raise a full % soon, they will hit the next ceiling much faster.

18 trillion may be one year's GDP only, something like 56K USD per capita. But this amount assumes all the non working persons like children and retirees are contributing 56K.
 
180 billion may be just 1% of the GDP but it's 4-6 months of budget deficit. If they raise a full % soon, they will hit the next ceiling much faster.

Spend and spend?  Can't disagree.
 
I am not an expert on this so feel free to correct my misconceptions.
 
A 1% interest rate hike will push interest burden up by 180 billion but if GDP is growing at 3%, it will also mean GDP growth of 550 billion.  Based on US' tax revenue to GDP ratio of 27%, the govt will collect additional tax of 150 billion, so it is not so dicey after all.
 
I wonder how they fix the debt issue in the past?

USA has been looking like a Ponzi scheme since years back. To a layman like me, printing money, raising debt ceiling, just to repay interest coupons without paying down the principal, looks like it's going to be forever indebted. Do they even have intention to pay down their debts?

Is it worthwhile to go for FHR (Fixed Deposit Home Rates)?
 
I understand that even though it is still considered as the bank's board rate, bank will try not to adjust it because it is peg to their fixed deposit rates.
 
If they increase the FHR rates, it will mean that they will need to pay more interest to their fixed D holders as well.

The most difficult part is nobody can be an expert regarding this issue. And nobody, including US policymakers, is willing to let US default take place. Their domestic and international creditors such as China, do not want to let them default. And if they really default and USD becomes worthless, what happens to currencies pegged to them?
 
Consider this: is revenue = profit, money that you put in the pocket and can be saved or used to repay previous debts? Not really. US has been running a deficit all the time since 20+ years ago. Their current year deficit is 400+B. If increase full % interest results in extra pure profit as you described, their deficit is still just under 400+B. Moreover, it's not a given that it will definitely grow revenue. If it results in foreclosures and people reducing risks, revenue might drop instead and widen the deficit plus pay more interests. So you can bet that US will be extremely careful about it.
 
Any solution? Your chart holds part of the answer (1940s). The other part can be sensed from what is happening globally right now.

Understanding how the flow of money and how "wealth" has being created, interest or what bulls**t about how much a currency is worth. First must understand what is "value"
 
So how do you value how much an asset is worth? While people debates over how much a certain currency is worth,  they failed to understand a simple fact,  the moment a particular currency is made worthless,  how does it affect the rest.
 
In us,  we have a established stabilization factor in which most of the time most places would be kept in peace while some places where their interest is involved remains fighting. 
 
Do you see them fighting in Korea?  The ones dying over there from starvation probably is so "less" that it is not even worth mentioning as compared to the thousands dying to Ebola or even war on so called terror.
 
No matter how rotten us is,  it is a necessary evil/good of which the lack of it makes the world an even worse place than it is today.
 
Imagine a world of every man for himself , do you think your place would be worth whatever amount you think it is worth today when without the rule of law,  anyone can snatch it from your hands if they are stronger.
 
The stupid would think that this number that number of debt cannot be repaid, to me it is just another number on the system , key another zero and everything is solved. I have no language ability to explain what I think I know but I think those which know what I am trying to say can help.
 
I do not expect everyone to understand but concepts of how valuation is made is slightly wrong. Some idiots think a % in hikes would be x amount of billions without knowing merely the hint of a hike has already wiped trillions of dollars out,  if one is trading again those would have probably made trillions back. Well stupidty is a blessing, I am glad I am a mere table wiper enjoying my hawker food and my tao hui zhui and not make uneducated guesses on how the financial system should/must work.

Maybe I need to add some hints.
 
value : the regard that something is held to deserve; the importance, worth, or usefulness of something
 
What is the value of a bottle of water to a dying man in a desert which found a treasure "worth" billions.
 
Life of people here too good , failed to understand how we are worth and how we are valued.

I only know the simple version of value.
 
Whatever X amount someone is prepare to pay for that item, that item has that X value. Human create value for something out of nothing.

I fail to understand, am an idiot and largely stupid. 
 
Therefore I do not listen to projections without backing logic. The last time US put a few zeros into their system, this was what happened to commodities and assets worldwide: hyperinflation. The moment they stopped keying zeros, we have zero inflation and a slight deflation. What does this tell us about Fiat and paper money value? 
 
"Hyperinflation is an extremely rapid period of inflation, usually caused by a rapid increase in the money supply. Usually due to unrestrained printing of fiat currency."
 
We are lucky the Govt magicked huge numbers of BTOs to stem the tide locally. There was an admitted overrun for private property prices up to 2013 due to over projection, but going forward, it should gradually settle into its equilibrium point with the increase in incomes and CPF caps, which support the market at HDB level. Ultimately, private represents only 15% of the whole market and there has already been 2.5 years of decline. Developers should make use of the decline in commodity and transport prices to build as fast as possible now. The HDB is also doing this.
 
And if there is a run for security worldwide, I am a firm believer that Singapore will be amongst the top 5 places people will try for. But this is off topic.
 
I shudder to think what will happen if US does NOT increase interest rates in Dec.

Years of QE have drove up prices, thus incentivizing business to expand production, the supply overhang is now here but demand has failed to catch up, with interest rate rising, it will be a double whammy.  Fed hikes will just quicken the consolidation needed to bring about an equilibrium, the strong will kill off or buy out the highly leveraged. How to profit from this cycle?

As recently as 2 weeks ago, OCBC and UOB were offering fixed first 2 yr rates at 1.68% but I think it has been withdrawn by now.
 
Maybe can wait the next promo but shld be higher abit but my take is if fixed first 2 yr rates are reasonable, can opt for that. 3rd yr maybe higher but you can do some partial repayment and also re-nego with the bank during the 3rd year but you normally can't re-finance with another bank until after the 3rd year.

 
 
Oh no, missed. Below 2% for 2 yrs are rates. How to know when they have promo again? They will publish in newspaper or can sign up for sms?

Agree on the basis of certain classes of property for which the buyers depended on full leverage without supporting incomes.
 
We have short circuited the rise from 2013 while HK and China cities continued their run.
 
Are you of the opinion that those who continued to buy in 2014 or 2015 after a 5-9% dip and meeting TDSR (of 0.6 assuming 3.5% interests) and other financing criteria are mostly weak and highly leveraged? Are they really ignorant lemmings who followed the crowds?
 
Ok really off topic le. Again I reiterate, a full percent hike is tolerable, but I highly doubt it can take place so fast in a year. If the hikes take place as planned then it can't be that only US does well and the other economies tank so likely economic growth will be solid. It cannot be also the rates rise fast if all emerging economies are not doing well.

There will definitely be ads in the papers I'm sure. Hopefully up 0.2 to 0.3% at most so shld be still below 2% but I just guessing only, will Hv to see what is offered eventually. 
 
Worry is they do away with the fixed for 2yrs altogether due to the uncertainty of how much rates will go up by.

err bro, TS asked this 3 years (Jan 2012)  ago. And if he did took a fix rate at that time (1% + SIBOR, cap at 1.49% for 3 years), he would have missed out the much lower variable rate package (0.75%+SIBOR). By Jan 2015, 3-month sibor is just 0.46%, so the variable package is actually better for that 3 years.
 
Oh in this case
 
I hope TS didn't get a cap
 
and save some money.

By you speaking like this , this are all "text" book solution and nothing to do with REALITY. Stop dreaming. Just a simple background check , have you done financing or worked in finance before? Borrowed money of even go malaysia to buy anything for instance "property". A loan of 2 milion taken when ringit was at 2.2~4 per SGD a few years ago and when the currency "devalues" to 3/ SGD , do you pay less or pay more if you are foriegner? You severely unestimated the flow of money. Haiz need to explain simple things.
 
Same applies for US and it's bond debt , those the government might have "lost" some interests and hike might cause some pain in interest repayments , but using those "free money" most FI would have easily made back those interests and more from the rise of property and various commodities elsewhere in the world and liquidated those investments and a hike is merely to make those prices drop to where those FI are comfortable again and for them to "reinvest".  This is how the cycle of money comes about  , the same way of your concept of how HDB "should" uses a lower commoditiy price to buy on "cheap". You see one but you fail to see another.Which is why i always say people seem to notice the flower but not the forest.
 
Are you aware that you potentially "pay" lesser internationally should the loan is taken in a currency which was particular weaken for a long period of time , namely USD. I won't bother to explain if you can't even understand such a simple logic and utter all sorts of bs which makes ZERO sense.
 
As for HDB and stuff , there are many people behind those ideas and those were proposed long long time ago and unlike what you think , those actions of "locking" in prices were done long ago , even if it was cheaper to build they would not do so as it doesn't justify the selling price if it was not on "demand". For example , a sand/cement import contract is a "fixed" price contract , not live wet market prices where everyday is different. Wow i don't wish to belittle anyone but i do really find it particularly naive. Wow garmen should make use of such time to do this and that.
 
As for what is FIAT currency , it is just a piece of paper which is guaranteed by a power which can assure that they are stronger than you and you can use that piece of paper to buy something , at least in their country. It applies to every country. The strenght/demand of it , depends on the "fear" of what other currencies or asset are worth less or nothing. The only thing which is internationally accepted is gold as a currency , the rest is just a merely guarantee , same applies for euro , ringit or even sgd. As for safe or not , it is not what you think but actually what LKY and gang thought long long time ago but that is another thing for another time. Explain to you also sai hei.
 
If you can't even understand this simple thing , i do not think you should be cutting and pasting all sort of bs which is not relevent.

You can make money not just from property, right?
 
I think those who enter after 2013 are those buying for own stay, for investors, they have got to be financially strong to get pass TDSR.

OK let's not deviate too far away from the thread. I have had to use textbook situations to explain my observations because these are proposals made by people who are far more advanced in finance than I am. I am all textbook and you are all reality - I think readers can differentiate easily.
 
In no uncertain terms, I think the Fed will indeed raise interest rate twice by Dec 16 but the frequency thereafter will be very muted and much less frequent than our bankers lead us to imagine. In fact, there is only a 0.43 correlation between US Fed interest raise and other central banks raise in interest rates. But of course, all these are devoid of reality to you, so no need to bother about them. Perhaps you could share your predictions about how Fed will move their interest rates in the next two years?
 
Gold has stopped being the global currency since WWII - this was discussed with an investment banker and verified online. And US is definitely not the only currency that can devalue, many countries (including us) are doing it at some point or all the time.
 
Of course, nothing I say makes any meaning. That's because I fail to understand, am an idiot, stupid, can't understand simple things, frog in the well, lemming, follow the crowd etc. The ends justify the means - at least I get this point.

On gold, while it may not be a "currency", it is certainly recognised as the real "money" simply because it cannot be created out of nothing.
 
In the old days before 1973 ( if I remember correctly), fiat money (or paper money) is pegged to the amount of gold they have.
 
Today, gold is somehow unloved and probably the lowest price in 5 years. I think it is time to buy back some...

We are all awaiting the June 2017 deadline for TDSR exemptions (for those who bought before June 2013) to see if diarrhoea happens. 1.5 years more for those guys to offload if they need to.
 
I will try to refrain from talking about property. Sorry for making bros feel uncomfortable about the SIBOR, if any.

I am also looking into gold.  
 
But there are also those who claim that when US interest rates rise, gold (that generates no interest) will be further unloved as compared to Fiat. So I am not making a move until that becomes clearer.

Well if you think so I can't stop you, I would like to highlight to you there are plenty side of the coin , merely talking to a "investment" banker and from forums would mean gold is no longer a global currency but why do people ranging from drug traffickers to rich billionaires move their funds via gold and diamonds and art work? Oh you mean your investment banker didn't tell you? It is merely via your normal fiak currency? Oh you mean you are the only one which knows investment blood suckers , the rest don't ? Only your one knows everything , others don't?
 
Do you think money only flows on the surface? As for FED rate increments, let's just say most of these has being factored. Anyway pointless debate when what I say and what you understand is different. I have already share a couple of times on possible rate hikes all the way to 2016, fed rates are likely to rise above 1% by mid 2017.
 
Well frog or not frog ,it is a fact a clown just told me hdb is making use of a lower commodity prices to build when simple common sense would have made anyone know that building contracts would being made long before the first plans were made , you mean only when they start building then they source ??
 
Well to each of their own. I merely highlighting facts , you think otherwise I cannot stop you , hope you can make plenty from it, likely our end points are the same but we might just have a different view, good luck though,

I never mentioned money flows on surface. You acknowledged flow of money, but a devaluing currency's funds also finds it's way into adjacent countries. It's much easier to move funds nowadays than through gold or diamonds or Artwork.
 
I am highlighting the possibility that when commodity prices spike, you can bet that costs all over will similarly spike, and both HDB and private developers will find it hard to manage costs as they are doing now.
 
Anyway, nobody's comments matter except Your Excellency's and you are absolutely right. But I am glad you committed to SIBOR figures. We will be able to match it in 2017.
 
Peace and best wishes. 
 
Well if you think so I can't stop you, I would like to highlight to you there are plenty side of the coin , merely talking to a "investment" banker and from forums would mean gold is no longer a global currency but why do people ranging from drug traffickers to rich billionaires move their funds via gold and diamonds and art work? Oh you mean your investment banker didn't tell you? It is merely via your normal fiak currency? Oh you mean you are the only one which knows investment blood suckers , the rest don't ? Only your one knows everything , others don't?Do you think money only flows on the surface? As for FED rate increments, let's just say most of these has being factored. Anyway pointless debate when what I say and what you understand is different. I have already share a couple of times on possible rate hikes all the way to 2016, fed rates are likely to rise above 1% by mid 2017.Well frog or not frog ,it is a fact a clown just told me hdb is making use of a lower commodity prices to build when simple common sense would have made anyone know that building contracts would being made long before the first plans were made , you mean only when they start building then they source ??Well to each of their own. I merely highlighting facts , you think otherwise I cannot stop you , hope you can make plenty from it, likely our end points are the same but we might just have a different view, good luck though,
 
Gold watch?
 
 
The gold referred here is gold bar, gold coin or any type of gold?

"A loan of 2 milion taken when ringit was at 2.2~4 per SGD a few years ago and when the currency "devalues" to 3 SGD , do you pay less or pay more if you are foriegner? You severely unestimated the flow of money."

Haha what was it in reply to? Are you too lost to forget your own questions you posted ?
 
 You mentioned the billion increase in bond repayments due to rate hikes I mention FIs already made a few times over back via foreign ventures. Wow ok ok you win, I don't know how to bend down so low to handle low caliber , my fault, I apologize for my language . Let me rot in my doom and gloom self pity hahahahaha
 
Just in case you are too stupid to even Google , US has a positive budget during Clinton time which is lesser than your claims over 20 years of budget deficits. Haixx wanna pick bones also dunno how to substantiate.
 
Last remembered only 2 presidents after Clinton how to have over 20 years of deficits ? Yes again I bend my words everything you say one.

I am using the most current budget deficit of 400+B. averaged. I never said every single year deficit. But the debt is growing and every person can see it. This is already a very improved deficit from previous years. How do you think it can be reduced based on ageing population of US? 
 
So FI gain several times, US debts get erased. 
 
Wow, I must be silly not to think of that. Clap clap. 
 
I apologise for my inability to connect these points.

The most difficult part is nobody can be an expert regarding this issue. And nobody, including US policymakers, is willing to let US default take place. Their domestic and international creditors such as China, do not want to let them default. And if they really default and USD becomes worthless, what happens to currencies pegged to them?
 
Consider this: is revenue = profit, money that you put in the pocket and can be saved or used to repay previous debts? Not really. US has been running a deficit all the time since 20+ years ago. Their current year deficit is 400+B. If increase full % interest results in extra pure profit as you described, their deficit is still just under 400+B. Moreover, it's not a given that it will definitely grow revenue. If it results in foreclosures and people reducing risks, revenue might drop instead and widen the deficit plus pay more interests. So you can bet that US will be extremely careful about it.
 
Any solution? Your chart holds part of the answer (1940s). The other part can be sensed from what is happening globally right now.
 

 
Seriously are you even reading? Wow .
 
Again you really do not know how money flows/supply works don't you? Please read up. Haha nvm just bs your way around again. Keep going around your fantasies of how you think of the world using assumptions and your logic.  Sorry my english is poor, my fault. Please pardon me on my low eq.
 
Haha good luck k. Have a great evening.

I apologise for not writing precisely. I meant the deficit has always been there. Perhaps I should write "maintained an overall deficit".
 
I do not mean annual deficits.
 
I.e. I have been running a fever all the time since the morning doesn't mean my fever can't go up and down from the morning till the evening. My focus is on "since".
 
But again I apologise for the balanced and surplus period that Clinton has stumbled into but stand corrected. I don't even wish to discuss what happens to the money when they have a surplus. This one you can Google and share if you want.
 
18 trillion is only the US Govt debt. The overall national debt (credits, cars, study loans and properties) add up to a total of much greater debt, with estimates at 56 trillion. I guess the majority of debt is owned by FIs. Guess only - please go ahead and Google me wrong.
 
Please kindly show how FIs gaining from devaluation leads to US debts disappearing. This part everyone including US president will be keen to know.

Sorry , you are no longer worth it. Excuse plenty. Have a good rest with your illness . Good luck with your assumptions on how the world works. Your level too high I don't know how to explain to you, Dunno never mind , people correct still wanna act clever, haix . Joker. 
 
Just one last time I explain , debt only by 18 trillion of which quite a lump sum of actually held by the treasury is being bought by federal reserves, where they "print" money by keying a few numbers, this in turn is used by various organisations to spur growth , might not be in us might be elsewhere, in fact QE is no longer expanding which means they will redeem their debt slowly and in time these debt are being "redeemed", in fact tapering has already started in 2014 if you are too stupid to even know all these , I do not think you are even reasoning. Haix

18,000,000,000,000.
 
If can redeem easily won't need to wait 20 years.
 
FIs gain a few times, debt write off. That's the most imaginative proposal since the invention of the Internet.

This has created a phenomenon known as debt-fueled growth. Over the last few years in particular, the economies of the world have been growing in dependence on debt to generate growth. There are three main issues with this growth methodology:
 
a. a lot of wanton spending happens. Excessive liquidity spurs ill-advised spending. Asset prices rise far more quickly than incomes and become unsustainable. People are channeling the increased liquidity that they are experiencing into assets purely out of greed (to capitalise on the stratospheric rises) and fear (to avoid missing out on the opportunities of capital growth).
 
b. the fat lady is going to sing eventually - monetary expansion cannot continue forever. The marriage of ballooning debt levels and sky-high asset prices results in a catastrophic crash the moment monetary expansion ceases and liquidity starts getting mopped up.
 
c. the writing is on the wall - global demand has been waning and commodity prices (which function as an indicator of growth) are plummeting even as we debate.
 
Everyone has the freedom of choice where it comes to investments. However the onus is on those who are in the know of the dangers of the situation to inform those who may not be aware. To those who shout "mai spread fear lah" and wave off the cautionary posts, I ask that you think of others who may be getting further into huge debts on the pretext of investment because they do not have awareness of the situation.
 
Add-on: refinancing is never a guranteed avenue, particularly when asset prices are in the midst of falling. Many folks get caught in a negative equity situation in which banks refuse to refinance/reprice without a top-up. The SIBOR rate has been increasing and the pace will quicken once the Fed hikes.

Sir, you are off topic.
 
The discussion here is on SIBOR levels and repricing.
 
It addresses mainly the concerns of home owners repricing.
 
I don't think anyone will be persuaded for or against based on forum readings. There is also a mountain of eligibility checks as safeguards. What is said just represents our views.

Sibor rates is affected by global rates ,national debt on growth global affects rates so how is it not related? Home loans or sibor are affected but rates decisions internationally? Now upgrade become moderator , decides who is out of point and who isn't? haha your illness quite serious.
 
As for housing repricing , most of the time , international banks follow instructions coming from their headquaters which might not be based in SG.
 
Most of the time , most local banks do not do so but i cannot say for foreigner banks which probably are funded elsewhere .
Err..... Then what is the best option ahead..... Do see the debt driven economy but given the situation, many ride along or is simply suck into it and just hope they are not the ones left hanging when shit hits he fan.
 
Personally , unless you can get a better deal else the cost of short term refinancing would be high. For those stuck for a longer period , it depends on how long you think this extended "rate" hike will be. To me it is likely to be at least 2~3 years and the cut would slowly move for around 2 years probably all and all around 5-7 years for one credit cycle.
 
So do your due dilligence.

Further downside pressure will be piled on commodities (including brent and WTI prices) as interest rate hikes start to come in. This causes a cascading effect on oil debt and will create a wave of defaults in the oil industry increasing borrowing costs and thereby producing a vicious cycle. 
 
Edit: New Fed rules to prohibit emergency loans to individual companies
 
http://www.cnbc.com/2015/11/30/new-fed-rules-to-prohibit-emergency-loans-to-individual-companies.html
 
Extracted from the above:
 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the Fed can now only offer broad-based emergency credit.
 
She also said that, under the new regulations, the central bank would not have been able to bail out Bear Stearns or AIG in 2008.

Just two points.
 
Firstly, SG does not (use to) regulate financial markets via interest rate, but through exchange rates. So SG debts are generally irrelevant to SIBOR rate fixing.
 
Secondly, the wisest man in MCF whose intellect is rivalled perhaps only by you, a fellow table wiper, tells me that debts work for those who have the liquidity to cover all debts but choose to borrow, as contrasted to those who borrow naked.
 
I am sure you know that SG debts are backed by SG sovereign wealth funds. Try to use Google to find if there is such a thing as US sovereign wealth fund.
 

These are jsut some illustrations to tell you infact our debt is also increasingly worrying. Do you think US is bad ? Look at ours .

Haha someone from the finance ministry of hougang chalet teaching me how to build castles in the air. Hahahaha.Oob think your illness quite bad , better check in soon. 
I don't need to Google for those stuff as I know those stuff at the back of my hand. Your two points are not even valid . Of cos they don't use interest rate to regulate the financial market, they use MAS as a regulatory.
 
Punts aside this is what sibor is
 
Definitions
 
SIBOR stands for Singapore Interbank Offered Rates. An individual Contributor Bank contributes the rate at which it could borrow funds, were it to do so by asking for and accepting the interbank offers in reasonable market size, just prior to 11:00 a.m. Singapore time.
 
SOR is defined as the synthetic rate for deposits in SGD, which represents the effective cost of borrowing the SGD synthetically by borrowing USD for the same maturity, and swap out the USD in return for the SGD.
 
 
You don't even know how any debt is derived and second go ask any one out there if huge debt given to people who borrow naked.  Wow
 
I don't claim to be the smartest , but I am probably smarter than you. I don't claim to know things I don't know and I don't have an imaginary investment banker friend.

What is fun with a bunch of robots merely to agree , no wonder nothing is working , the oldies would probably made enough because of the opportunity given, are those people working to secure future for us? Or are they comfortable with what they have ? 
 
How are we going to secure key components  we need for our growth I,e sand for reclaiming , food sources , future technology ? What I see are pettite conversations done deals and past exploits and show of wealth made from the past ? Have any warn of what is to come or even share how to make money in the future? 
 
I am consistently in conflict with myself and others as I explore ideas. My debate style is always aggressive as that's my nature. If people can't accept they are free to ignore, don't lose anything ignoring me.

I say upbringing has a role in this and if one cannot AGREE TO DISAGREE, then stay out of the forums....Nuff said!

ive mentioned before. Perhaps the individual is ignored(not difficult to see why) in real life, so have to gain attention somewhere....and thus this becomes a convenient platform.  
 
Have advised others to just ignore the ranting insanity of the person and life will go on as per normal.  Dun take it too hard as it is not their fault that this fellow comes and irritates the hell out of others EVEN WHEN IGNORED.

I am sure you know that SG debts are backed by SG sovereign wealth funds. Try to use Google to find if there is such a thing as US sovereign wealth fund.

 
US don't need sovereign wealth fund to issue debt. They figured out long ago that it was more cost efficient to underwrite debt with aircraft carriers.

US rate increment is a confirm thing, key issue is how fast and how much.
 
cheap money will be gone soon. even Fed decided not to raise in december definitely will happened in first half 2016.
 
My concern is what will happen to oil price?

If you think they will go up , then buy some oil stocks when they are low.
 
The caveat as always is "if"

Singapore interest rates rise ahead of Fed's decision
 
http://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/local-interest-rates-rise-ahead-of-feds-decision?xtor=CS3-20
 
 
SINGAPORE - Local interest rates are inching up and investors are on edge as the countdown to Thursday's decision by the United States Federal Reserve begins in earnest.
 
It is widely expected that the Fed will raise interest rates from near-zero levels - the first such rise in nine years - and the effects are already rippling through Singapore's financial and currency markets.
 
 
The greenback has strengthened against the Singdollar. More importantly, for mortgage holders and business owners, the cost of lending is going up.
 
The three-month swap offer rate (SOR), a benchmark for commercial loans and some home loans, spiked to a new three-month high of 1.59168 per cent yesterday from 1.50597 per cent last Friday and 1.39520 per cent on Thursday. The previous high was at 1.56409 per cent on Sept 8.
 
It is now almost four times higher than at this time last year.
 
It is a similar story with the three-month Singapore interbank offered rate (Sibor). The Sibor, which is used extensively to price home loans, hit a two-month high of 1.12865 per cent yesterday and is now almost three times higher than its level 12 months ago.
 
This means the monthly repayments on a $500,000 loan with a 25-year period pegged to Sibor will be $168 more than a year ago, while one pegged to the three-month SOR will be $262 more.
 
 
 
The US rate hike has been flagged for several months, during which a rising number of home owners have switched to fixed-rate mortgages, and a new product pegged to fixed deposit rates was launched.
 
SOR loans became popular around 2010-2011, when SOR started to dip below Sibor.
 
Most home loans extended by DBS Bank, Singapore's largest provider of mortgages, are pegged to Sibor, with fewer than 500 based on SOR, said Mr Tok Geok Peng, its executive director of secured lending.
 
Personal finance portal MoneySmart.sg estimates that 45 per cent of mortgages are pegged to fixed deposit rates, 50 per cent to Sibor and the remainder to SOR, based on loan take-ups in the past two months.
 
ABN Amro chief economist Han de Jong noted that this will "undoubtedly be one of the best flagged rate increases ever, so it is hard to see how people can be caught off guard, but you never know".
 
DBS Bank economist Eugene Leow said: "We expect a 25-basis point hike but much of this has already been priced into the market.
 
"We suspect that Sibor and SOR rates will likely rise by a smaller magnitude than US rates."
 
DBS sees Sibor at 1.4 per cent by the first quarter next year.
 
The rate talk has also hit stocks and currencies as investors wait on the sidelines for a decision. The US dollar rose from 1.4095 to the Singdollar last Friday to 1.4129 yesterday while local share investors, who seem determined to keep their powder dry until later in the week, left the benchmark Straits Times Index down 0.69 per cent yesterday.

Just when majority of people think this time round fed confirm will raise interest rate. Wait there is another suprised yet again. I believe this time round, no matter whether fed raise or don't raise interest rate, our local bank will still raise interest rate anyway. So there will be no much difference for local bank.

Good for you bro! It serves no purpose to hope for bloodshed cos end of day being so small, we too will be affected one way or another, perhaps only the top 10-15% of Singaporeans are cushioned. 
 
Being in the finance industry, I know quite a few of these people and even they don't hope for bloodshed and in fact told me they hope for all round stability n prosperity for all Singaporeans so they they too can continue to enjoy their fruits and being humane, want fellow Singaporeans to enjoy the country's fruits as well. Maybe that's why they are in the top % of Singaporeans with this kind of humble attitude! Cheers n hv a good day ahead!!

Winter and the biting cold come regardless of whether people believe in them or not.
 
IMHO, it is important that we do not ignore the red flags that have been appearing. why not be prepared for contingencies? Having a positive mindset does not mean pushing aside practical risks, and pointing out danger signs is not a negative behaviour if it helps those who are unprepared get ready for crisis.
 
This is not born of misplaced delusional messianic behaviour but a simple hope that folks are more ready when the dominoes eventually fall. 
 
Today the danger signs in the global economy are clear and present - asset prices have been hitting record highs, levels that have been directly or indirectly fuelled by debt and borrowings that are unsustainable based on today's median incomes. 
 
Defaults in the bond markets are increasing by the day and local financial institutions have been diligently raising the rates at which they lend out money, ahead of the upward shifts in SIBOR and SOR.
 
Commodity prices are in a downward spiral and O&G companies that were once the darlings of investors are now on the precipice of collapse due to their inability to refinance mid and long-term debt.
 
These are the equivalent of the rumbling earth and smoke wisps that appear as precursor to the eruption of a volcano. Turning away from the signs does not make the problem go away. The emerging cracks are hints of deeper foundation fractures.

US Federal Reserve opens meeting to put an end to crisis-era policy
 
The US Federal Reserve building in Washington, DC.PHOTO: BLOOMBERG
PUBLISHED2 HOURS AGO
WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - Eight years after a devastating recession opened an era of loose US monetary policy, the Federal Reserve on Tuesday (Dec 15) began a two-day meeting at which it is expected to turn in the other direction and raise rates in an increasingly normal economy.
 
The decision will be released on Wednesday at 2pm (Thursday 3am, Singapore time), with markets prepared for an initial 25 basis point "lift-off" that would move the Fed's target rate from the zero lower bound to a range of between 0.25 and 0.50 percentage points. It is to be followed by a news conference by Fed chair Janet Yellen to elaborate on the central bank's latest policy statement.
 
Markets on Tuesday set a positive stage for the Fed's potentially historic turn. US stock indices were up around one per cent, bond yields moved higher, and analysts said that after weeks of preparation a surprise decision not to hike would be the more disruptive choice.
 
"Given the strength of the signals that have been sent it would be credibility destroying not to carry through," former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, a sceptic of the need to raise rates right now, said in remarks published on Tuesday on his website.
 
The rate hike will separate the Fed from major central banks in Tokyo, Frankfurt, Beijing and elsewhere that are all battling to stimulate their economies and generate growth.
 
The initial hike expected on Wednesday will still leave US policy extremely loose, and Fed officials have signalled they will act cautiously from that point forward to nurture a tepid recovery.
 
Markets and analysts will focus on the exact language the Fed uses in its statement to justify the hike and describe how it will evaluate the timing of a second and subsequent steps.
 
Analysts at TD Securities said they expected the statement and updated economic forecasts from policymakers to take a hawkish tilt that emphasises every meeting will be "live" for a possible hike.
 
As of September, Fed officials expected perhaps four rate hikes next year. "The statement... should be relatively hawkish. The Fed will look to project confidence," the analysis said.
 
Though modest, the Fed's token first step remains fraught.
 
In the days to come, the Fed will have to prove that a new set of tools for managing interest rates will work as expected, see how higher US rates affect domestic and global financial conditions, and hope that weak world demand and commodity prices do not lead to an overall bout of deflation and force the Fed to reverse course.
 
To be considered a success, the Fed needs its rate hike to be followed next year by continued US growth, continued low unemployment, and, perhaps most in doubt, a turn higher in inflation.
 
For all the talk of abnormal times and changes in underlying economic fundamentals, the Fed is pinning its hopes on a very conventional premise - that the US consumer will keep spending at recent strong rates, encouraged by low unemployment and the apparent beginnings of a rise in wages. "The American consumer is in full gear and there is nothing but tailwind... They are right to be confident," said Mr Mark Zandi, chief economist with Moody's Analytics.
 
The turn towards higher rates has been months in the making.
 
The Fed under Ms Yellen has carefully stripped its policy statement of most future-oriented promises to keep rates low, along with ending crisis-era asset purchase programmes.
 
With unemployment falling steadily through the year, there has been steadily less justification for crisis-era policy, and a sense among policymakers that they could balance the higher rates sought by "hawks" with a slow pace of subsequent increases.
 
Still, opinion is not unanimous. Some Fed policymakers have said they worry the world economy is too weak for the Fed to successfully march off on its own. Labour groups on Tuesday said pockets of employment and wage growth overall are still too weak to warrant tighter financial conditions. "There's no reason to think that the pace of economic growth today is excessive and needs to be slowed because of incipient inflation," Mr Josh Bivens, research director at the Economic Policy Institute, said in calling on the Fed not to hike.
 
"Right now, lower unemployment that boosted wage and price growth would be an affirmatively good thing. Wages and prices are clearly growing too slowly."

Factual posts be it positive or negative are always welcome. Speculation without foundation although can be a personal opinion reeks of a poster with hidden anxieties or perhaps other agendas if done on a regular basis. 
 
Bro @mercs posts though mostly positive in nature are not of a personal opinion but taken from factual reports from various sources. Admittedly, it's not always good to read too much into reports be they positive or otherwise as statistics can be presented in a skewed way as well. U have countered with warning signs which should be heeded as well n thus both you n Mercs posts I read with enthusiasm always, cheers!

Even though when took loan that time, most would be mentally prepared to take the risks else would have gone for fixed rates instead, still no one would hope for an increase

Goes w/o saying. When you take loan to buy a property:
 
1. lowest interest is always better
2. higher inflation is always better

think quite tough lah. This rate hike is like the most confirmed rate hike ever...  
Symbolic gesture.
 
It's what happens after that I am more interested in. Some interpret further rates hikes after that is a short term negative but long term positive. (if the Fed is indeed looking at the strength of the economy and employment numbers before hiking rates)

According to analysts, fed needs to increase interest rates now since US $$ has risen 30-40% last 2 years against currency such as jap yen, they need to increase the rates to show US economy is doing well
 
Possible symbolic as u said

Bro @OmOm might be inferring this intended effect of a rate hike?
Inflation/deflation and interest rates are not directly linked. Traditionally lower interest rates provide a stimulatory effect on the economy because as borrowing costs decrease, consumers and corporates should spend more given the lower cost of funds. 
However, in reality there is a middle component between the two and that is the willingness to spend. The situation today is that although money-printing has been rampant, only a fraction of easy money has been flowing out into the real economy. The rest has remained wedged in banks and financial institutions which are the first (or second in certain cases) layer to receive the funds. 
 
This produces the unconventional outcome - super low interest rates without corresponding high inflation. Inflation in prices arises only because participants in the economy are competing for resources (products/services). If demand is low due to lack of willingness to spend or if supply is high relative to demand, inflation does not happen.

Demand Pull - Inflation in prices arise only because participants in the economy are competing for resources (products/services). If demand is low due to lack of willingness to spend or if supply is high relative to demand, inflation does not happen.

There are other factors that contribute to inflation.
 
For the USA:
Factors that usually cause cost push inflation are not there (yet).
 
Wage inflation is also not evident, for most of the wage earners in the US.
 
The USD is strengthening. Imported inflation (into the US) will also not rear its ugly head.
 
So the rate hike alone is not going to boost inflation numbers. Hence, it is very difficult to see a sustained rate hike after the symbolic 0.25 increase at the coming Fed meeting.
 
The only reason to hike rates beyond the coming 0.25 is the desire to "normalize" interest rates as rates have stayed ultra low for too long and there are undesirable (depending on which side you're on) side effects that come with that.

Singapore interest rates rise ahead of Fed's decision
 
http://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/local-interest-rates-rise-ahead-of-feds-decision?xtor=CS3-20
 
 
SINGAPORE - Local interest rates are inching up and investors are on edge as the countdown to Thursday's decision by the United States Federal Reserve begins in earnest.
 
It is widely expected that the Fed will raise interest rates from near-zero levels - the first such rise in nine years - and the effects are already rippling through Singapore's financial and currency markets.
 
 
The greenback has strengthened against the Singdollar. More importantly, for mortgage holders and business owners, the cost of lending is going up.
 
The three-month swap offer rate (SOR), a benchmark for commercial loans and some home loans, spiked to a new three-month high of 1.59168 per cent yesterday from 1.50597 per cent last Friday and 1.39520 per cent on Thursday. The previous high was at 1.56409 per cent on Sept 8.
 
It is now almost four times higher than at this time last year.
 
It is a similar story with the three-month Singapore interbank offered rate (Sibor). The Sibor, which is used extensively to price home loans, hit a two-month high of 1.12865 per cent yesterday and is now almost three times higher than its level 12 months ago.
 
This means the monthly repayments on a $500,000 loan with a 25-year period pegged to Sibor will be $168 more than a year ago, while one pegged to the three-month SOR will be $262 more.
 
 
 
The US rate hike has been flagged for several months, during which a rising number of home owners have switched to fixed-rate mortgages, and a new product pegged to fixed deposit rates was launched.
 
SOR loans became popular around 2010-2011, when SOR started to dip below Sibor.
 
Most home loans extended by DBS Bank, Singapore's largest provider of mortgages, are pegged to Sibor, with fewer than 500 based on SOR, said Mr Tok Geok Peng, its executive director of secured lending.
 
Personal finance portal MoneySmart.sg estimates that 45 per cent of mortgages are pegged to fixed deposit rates, 50 per cent to Sibor and the remainder to SOR, based on loan take-ups in the past two months.
 
ABN Amro chief economist Han de Jong noted that this will "undoubtedly be one of the best flagged rate increases ever, so it is hard to see how people can be caught off guard, but you never know".
 
DBS Bank economist Eugene Leow said: "We expect a 25-basis point hike but much of this has already been priced into the market.
 
"We suspect that Sibor and SOR rates will likely rise by a smaller magnitude than US rates."
 
DBS sees Sibor at 1.4 per cent by the first quarter next year.
 
The rate talk has also hit stocks and currencies as investors wait on the sidelines for a decision. The US dollar rose from 1.4095 to the Singdollar last Friday to 1.4129 yesterday while local share investors, who seem determined to keep their powder dry until later in the week, left the benchmark Straits Times Index down 0.69 per cent yesterday.

With Sibor at 1.4% plus bank's margin and housing rent creeping down (heard 3BR condo at The Luxurie, a new condo within walking distance to SengKang MRT, is now at $2500), more will be pumping in cash to service their monthly mortgage payment.

Good for you bro! It serves no purpose to hope for bloodshed cos end of day being so small, we too will be affected one way or another, perhaps only the top 10-15% of Singaporeans are cushioned. 
 
Being in the finance industry, I know quite a few of these people and even they don't hope for bloodshed and in fact told me they hope for all round stability n prosperity for all Singaporeans so they they too can continue to enjoy their fruits and being humane, want fellow Singaporeans to enjoy the country's fruits as well. Maybe that's why they are in the top % of Singaporeans with this kind of humble attitude! Cheers n hv a good day ahead!!

You have a good heart.

I will either pay off or get another one when everyone is fearful even after all CMs are removed. But that will be a sad outcome for almost everyone in every sector.
 
Time to draw out the emergency stacks in the worst case scenario. 
 
But very unlikely as explained before.

My friends in property tell me dun buy if you are looking for investments. Not in the next one or two years. Buy commercial if you really want to buy as yields are still good.
 
I believe it is self fulfilling. If everyone is cautious, naturally the economy will be bad next year. Fools venture where Devils fear to tread. However some will always say the best time to invest is when you see blood on the streets. 
 
I like oil. Looks good over a 3years horizon. But it's more like a punt.

Wow, $2,500 is just barely enough to fight off the monthly loan payment. If Aunt Yellen up again, there will be negative cash flow & blood. 2016 is will be the mother of TOP, one condo every fortnight. Tenants are simply spoilt for choice.

Yeah, rental market is under a lot of pressure.  Vacancy rate will likely cross 10% in 2016.  Usually a vacancy rate of above 8% is bad but low interest rate will keep many afloat for a while.
 
$2500 may not be sufficient to cover cash flow @ 60% financing ratio if you buy after 2014, you need to factor in maintenance fee, property tax, agent's commission, etc.

Life after Singapore The recruiter from China

PublishedDec 13, 2015, 5:00 am SGT

 

He did well in Singapore but returned to China to care for his young son. His career has taken off. The catch? His wife stayed in Singapore
Olivia Ho In Luoyang (Henan)

The most difficult choice that Chinese national Wang Cheng Jun ever had to make was leaving Singapore.
Mr Wang and his wife Zhang Li- min, also from China, had spent three happy years working and living together in Singapore. He was a recruitment agent, initially as an S Pass holder before gaining an Employment Pass, and she was on an S Pass as a nurse.
But the birth of their first son in 2013 turned this life upside down.
 
 
Mrs Wang went back to China to give birth to Zi Hang in the couple's home province of Henan. The family planned at first to return to Singapore together.
Then reality hit: the couple realised that they could not raise their child in the country they wanted to call home. This was because of their long working hours, and under their S Passes, their salaries were not high enough to allow them to bring in dependants like Mr Wang's mother, who could take care of the baby.
 
 
 
JOB AND FAMILY PROFILE

NAME: Mr Wang Cheng Jun, a.k.a. Wayne
AGE: 33
HOMETOWN: Xinxiang, Henan, China
FAMILY: Married to Zhang Limin, 32, a nurse in Singapore. They have a two-year-old son, Zi Hang.
LIVED IN SINGAPORE: 2010-2013
JOB IN SINGAPORE: General desk manager at a recruitment firm
WORK PASS: S Pass, later Employment Pass
CURRENT PLACE OF RESIDENCE: Luoyang, Henan, China
CURRENT JOB: Vice-general manager at a recruitment firm
ADVICE TO OTHER MIGRANTS: "Incomes are better there, but gaining training and experience is more important. There is nothing like having to survive in a strange place where you have nobody but yourself to rely on. If you do come back, you will be miles ahead of your peers who never left."


The S Pass is meant to help meet companies' needs for mid-skilled foreign manpower, bridging the salary gap between Employment Pass (EP) holders and Work Permit holders. There are about 173,800 S Pass holders in Singapore, making them the smallest of the four work pass groups here.
S Pass holders can be found in a wide range of jobs, including construction site supervisors, technicians, restaurant managers and dancers.
The minimum monthly salary to qualify for an S Pass is $2,200, which has been raised steadily from $1,800 in 2011. S Pass holders also have to have a degree or a diploma.
Under a new tiered system introduced in 2013, older and more experienced S Pass applicants will need to qualify at higher salaries.
S Pass holders are counted within a company's work permit quota and are capped at 20 per cent of the company's total workforce. This excludes the services sector, where the quota was cut to 15 per cent in 2013 to curb the influx of S Pass workers there.

In the end, Mr Wang decided to move back to China to take care of the baby boy. It would be easier for him to find a better job back home, he reasoned, and his wife could stay in Singapore as a nurse, a job she could not bear to give up.
Two years later, the 33-year-old has become second-in-command in a recruitment firm based in Luoyang, Henan, sending out Chinese workers to Singapore.
As vice-general manager of recruitment firm Luoyang New-Link, he could now be said to be on equal footing with those he used to work for in Singapore, and estimates he earns easily twice to three times as much as he did then, which was around $3,000 a month.
However, he still misses Singapore - its standard of living, its orderly traffic, how one could easily take a weekend getaway to Bali or Bintan, and the fact that spitting on the road is frowned upon.
He is also painfully conscious that raising his son apart from his wife is getting tougher.
Mr Wang told The Sunday Times in Mandarin: "I have never thought as hard about anything as I did about leaving Singapore. It was the hardest decision I have ever made in my life."
NOTHING TO LOSE
With more than three years of work experience in Singapore under his belt, Mr Wang had his pick of job offers when he returned to China.
However, he chose to become a shareholder partner in Luoyang New-Link, a small agency in Henan.
Located in central China, south of the Yellow River, Henan has more than 94 million inhabitants.
Mr Wang was born in a small town two hours away from the city of Xinxiang in northern Henan. His parents were wheat farmers. Before he went to secondary school, he had never seen a computer.
Before he went to Shandong University, he did not own one.
Mr Wang graduated with a bachelor's degree in foreign language studies - he had learnt English and Japanese - and began working as a recruitment agent for a textile export company in the seaside town of Weihai.
He married his university sweetheart in 2008, but Mrs Wang was restless in Weihai. She disliked the life of a nurse in China, with its long overnight shifts and poor work-life balance.
"There's also the need to have connections," the 32-year-old said. "China is a giant network of connections.
"Getting promoted is not really according to your abilities. It was a big headache for me. I could not play their game."
When the opportunity to work as a private nurse in Singapore cropped up in 2008, Mrs Wang jumped at it. By 2009, she had moved to the National Kidney Foundation, where she still works today.
Mr Wang remained in his job in Weihai until he was able to follow her a year later, after he was approached by a Singapore agent who needed urgently to fill a vacancy at a recruitment firm.
He admitted that he did not really think it through, but he was young and felt he had nothing to lose.
His bravado flagged only once, when he said goodbye to his childhood friend before boarding a bus to the airport. "It hit me that I was leaving a familiar, safe place to go to a totally strange environment," he said. "I started crying uncontrollably."
In Singapore, the couple lost a lot of weight - Mr Wang estimated he dropped about 10kg because he had no friends to go out and eat with - but gained in other ways.
Within a year of his arrival, he had moved to recruitment firm People Worldwide Consulting as a general desk manager and had been upgraded to an Employment Pass, which was for those who earned $2,800 or more a month back in 2011.
BECOMING A FATHER SUDDENLY
When his son was born in Xinxiang, Mr Wang was on a plane from Singapore to China - but not for the birth. Instead, he was headed to Shanghai for a major recruitment project. Shortly after he boarded the plane and switched his phone off, his wife went into labour.
Mr Wang recalled: "While she was giving birth, I was flying through the air, clueless. It was only after I landed that I turned on my phone and saw all these messages.
"I had trouble believing it at first. I got off that plane and suddenly I was a father."
Even then, it was many more hours before Mr Wang could wrap up his business in Shanghai and fly to Xinxiang to see the new mother and child. "I couldn't abandon my client," he said.
"My wife's relatives were there, my relatives were there, everyone was there - except me. This is something I regret very much."
Within a few months of Zi Hang's arrival, the couple had to return to Singapore to continue working, leaving him behind in China in the care of Mr Wang's 60-year-old mother.
But he said: "My wife was worried every day. She feared my mother wasn't taking care of our son well. Every day, we would fight over the smallest things, where we never fought before. She would cry all the time."
Mr Wang realised something had to give. By the end of the year, he had returned to China. He said: "I don't see it as a sacrifice. My son's existence prompted me to make a decision, and so far I think it has been a good one."
He added: "If my wife can get permanent resident status, we can live together in Singapore again some day. We want to send our son to school there, because the education system is better than China's. In a way, my wife is staying in Singapore for the sake of our son's education."
Zi Hang is now two years old. He is vaguely aware that his mother is in a faraway place called Singapore, accessible sometimes by the phone app WeChat. "We call her and I show her the cars Papa has bought me," he mused in Mandarin. "Or I tell her stories. I sing her songs they teach me in class."
Talking about the separation of her family brings tears to Mrs Wang's eyes. She said: "Sometimes I wonder if I am selfish.
"If I gave up my job here, I would always regret it. I like my work here. I'm used to life here.
"But this time, when my child is small, this is a time that I will never be able to get back. I don't know how long we can continue like this."
THE SINGAPORE DREAM
Mr Wang may have had to leave Singapore, but through his work at Luoyang New-Link, he tries to give his countrymen the opportunity to walk in his footsteps.
Many of those who apply to Luoyang New-Link hail from the countryside. To reach out to these people, the company has a branch office in the rural town of Songxian, to which Mr Wang drives for more than an hour from central Luoyang every other week.
When the bridge to Songxian is blocked, he has to make a bumpy detour through a nearby village, a maze of narrow, muddy roads lined with hole-in-the-wall houses, rows of dark cabbages larger than a man's head, and gourds strung up to dry in the winter wind.
"This village is the kind of place where many of our people come from," said Mr Wang, who was in Songxian last month to give a talk to the families of those he has placed in Singapore.
Eager for updates on their loved ones, a crowd of about 60 thronged a draughty auditorium to watch, rapt, as Mr Wang showed them PowerPoint slides filled with glossy photos of Singapore's skyline, its public transport system, and of beaming Chinese workers in service uniforms.
One of about 900 licensed agents in China, Luoyang New-Link sends between 400 and 500 workers to Singapore a year. Most of these come in as work permit holders. They take up jobs as bus captains or casino croupiers. They work in factories, man fast-food counters, even clean stables.
The firm takes a cut of two months' salary from the workers they place, which Mr Wang estimated could be between $2,000 and $4,000.
He is aware of the resentment that some locals feel towards foreigners who they believe are taking their jobs. He maintains, however, that the jobs he fills are not those that locals want to begin with, which is why companies turn to foreign recruiters.
His business partner Zhao Wenhao, 29, said it was Mr Wang's experience in Singapore that made him the right fit for the job. "To have this kind of international experience in a place like Luoyang is rare.
"When he deals with the Singapore agents, he knows their expectations and can communicate with them very clearly. Based on his own experiences, he can also brief the workers well before they go over.
Said Mr Wang: "I like to think I am helping people change their lives by going to Singapore. I had that chance, and I changed myself. If there is one thing I regret, it is that I did not come to Singapore when I was even younger.
"I always tell the people I send - don't let your dreams stay dreams."

No offence to anyone here. 
 
But I have never heard of anyone financing housing with credit cards. Credit card debts are usually paid off first for the group I know of. Some of them do not even have one credit card.
 
But maybe it's the other expenses that accumulate in the newspaper report.
 
The most likely stuffs you can seize from this group are luxury stuffs and cars.

Fed Reserve announces historic rate increase, first since 2006
The US central bank's policy-setting committee raised the range of its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to between 0.25 per cent and 0.50 per cent.

The Fed's rate hike, in five points
The US central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate for the first time in more than nine years on Wednesday.
 
Posted 17 Dec 2015 03:33 Updated 17 Dec 2015 07:15
 
1. What did the Federal Reserve do and why?
 
The US central bank raised its benchmark federal funds rate for the first time in more than nine years on Wednesday (Dec 16). The rate had been next to zero since December 2008, and was increased by a quarter point to a range of 0.25-0.50 per cent. The Fed says the economy has rebounded enough since the Great Recession that the rate should begin rising, albeit slowly.
 
2. Why is this important?
 
The rate sets the basis for short-term lending in the financial sector. But, combined with expectations for future rate moves, it also guides longer-term interest rates which affect how much people pay on loans to buy homes and cars, how much businesses pay to finance their activities, and how much banks pay savers for deposits. It also has a big impact what foreign companies and governments pay to borrow.
 
3. What is the significance of Wednesday's increase?
 
Generally speaking, the Fed cuts rates when growth is weak to stimulate spending and investment, and increases them to rein in overly fast growth. In this case, after keeping the rate extraordinarily low for so long, the Fed is pushing it higher to get ahead of any potential inflationary pressures and ensuring markets such as those for stocks and property do not overheat on easy money. But because economic growth remains only moderate, the Fed promises to keep the rate relatively low for the foreseeable future to encourage investment and spending.
 
4. Why have some objected to a rate increase?
 
Some economists say global growth is too weak, and US growth too vulnerable, to begin raising the cost of money, which they say could discourage investment and hiring. To encourage growth, the central banks of Europe, China and Japan have eased policy rather than tightening it. Some warn that if the US economy slows, the Fed will have to reverse course and lose credibility.
 
5. What was the immediate impact?
 
Markets had ample warning that this was coming to prepare, and interest rates in many cases had already risen. On Wednesday stock markets around the world pushed solidly higher, and on Wall Street the S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent about 15 minutes after the rate announcement.
 
The US dollar, which has been stronger all year, rose 0.1 per cent to US$0.9498 per euro.

They finally mustered the courage to do the right thing. I was quite worried that they played punk again.
 
Steady, thumbs up Fed!
 
I feel there is some logic in the raising of interests to signal or push inflation. People (corporations) in the West think quite differently - confidence is key for their motivation and economy. In the East, we are likely to feel more pessimistic and wait to see what transpires. But if US does well, the world will unlikely do too badly - that's why they are still our leader (pop, technology, economy). That is why when they drop their rates or goes for QE, the world follows, the world is still dropping and they are the only one to raise. What would be really scary is if the action does not result in rise in inflation - what can be done thereafter?
 
Let's wish the US all the best and support them in their journey.

Not do the right thing, it's because they have no choice. They are boxed to a corner already, if this time round no rate hike, I tell you. A lot of investors will not believe fed already, then fed will be in even worst position.

The US dollar, which has been stronger all year, rose 0.1 per cent to US$0.9498 per euro.

For point 1- this may raise the cost US debt going forward. US has  lots of debt- even at today's interest rates, one could argue the debt is being inflated away.
 
Point 4-
I'm on the other side -a slightly different view here. The Fed can point to weakening data in future if it needs to cut. By taking a small step given the prolonged low interest, it gains credibiliy. She is probably doing a good job.
There should be something for savers... 
 
Point 5- maybe the medium term effect might be funds going back to US if it has not already done so.
Less hot money around is not a bad thing.

If next year market is gonna be really bad, property sales will decline, loans will decrease
 
Wont we see another fall in interest rates to spur buying?

perhaps,
 
or alternative scenario, banks raise rates to have margin- there could be side effects from this- more NPLs and banks profitability can hurt or they turn out to be geniuses because pp can pay.
.
 
In economics planning, all scenarios must be considered

Locally, experts believe the recent hike should not have a sudden or disruptive impact on interest rates, as well as the property market in Asia Pacific, given that the increases has been widely anticipated.
 
“The varied rate cycles in which markets in Asia Pacific currently find themselves should counterbalance the effect on property yields. There may be a gradual upward resetting of return expectations, which in the short term may be more muted as this move has been expected. However, this will work through as rates rise further in the future,” said Dr Henry Chin, Head, CBRE Research, Asia Pacific.
 
In Singapore, the rate hike is expected to have a minimal impact on the Singapore interbank offered rate (SIBOR) as the local central bank have already priced in the increases. Meanwhile, CBRE’s Desmond Sim noted that it will, however, “put further pressure on capital values in light of the weakening occupier market. The yield spread is not expected to compress any further.”

Now China is the main player and will be the rising stars. Be it we like it or not, it's not our choice in terms of the big picture.
 
Although China are good at copy cat and make fake products, there are still many out there who are doing honest business. 
 
Chinese yuan just recently join in the group of the reserve currency alongside with USD, euro and Japanese yen. So expect Chinese yuan to grow even stronger after the Fed rate hike.

Mortgagee listings set to hit 7-year high: Colliers International

Mortgagee listings set to hit 7-year high: Colliers International
POSTED: 17 December 2015 at 8:48 PM
UPDATED: 17 December 2015 at 8:48 PM

SINGAPORE: Mortgagee listings in Singapore look set to hit a seven-year high by the end of 2015. According to property services firm Colliers International, 241 repossessed properties were put up for auction this year, up by almost 52 per cent from 159 in 2014. This is the highest since 2008.
 
In a media release on Thursday (Dec 17), Colliers International said there were 555 owner listings in the property auction market, bringing the total auction listings for 2015 to a six-year high of 796. In 2014, there were 529 auction listings. 
 
Colliers said the increase was because borrowers in default faced difficulties in selling their properties. Residential properties formed the bulk of listings at 79.6 per cent. 
 
In terms of segments, mortgagee listings for landed homes more than doubled from 19 in 2014 to 50 this year. For non-landed properties, the number rose from 104 to 142 units year-or-year. 
 
 
(Table: Colliers International)
Industrial properties took up 14.9 per cent of listings. The number of such properties listed also jumped from 17 in 2014 to 36 this year. 
 
Despite the increase, Colliers said the numbers are still lower than during the Asian Financial Crisis in 1998 and the Global Financial Crisis in 2008. Looking to 2016, the real estate services company estimates the number of mortgagee sales to continue pushing higher and exceed 270, as higher interest rates will add further strain on borrowers struggling to finance their mortgages.

Singapore interest rates to rise following Fed Hike: Economists

SINGAPORE: Businesses and homeowners in Singapore should expect to pay higher interest rates in the coming year.
 
That is according to economists following the US Federal Reserve's decision overnight (Dec 16) to raise its benchmark rate by one quarter of a percentage point to between 0.25 per cent and 0.50 per cent.
 
Economists said the Fed's first interest rate hike in nearly a decade is a sign of confidence that the US economy is on the mend and that it was time to push rates up to more normal levels.
 
According to United Overseas Bank (UOB), the move will push Singapore's interest rates higher. It expects the benchmark three-month Sibor to end 2016 at around 1.5 per cent, up from current levels of around 1.1 per cent. As for the Singapore dollar, UOB sees the US dollar peaking at around 1.46 in the middle of next year, giving a slight lift to exports.
 
The Sing dollar is currently trading around 1.41 to the greenback.
 
"For a start I will think that the Sing dollar will continue to weaken against the US dollar, at least for the first and second quarter of 2016,” said Mr Francis Tan, an economist at UOB. “What this means is that we're expecting the US dollar and the Sing dollar to reach a high of around 1.46 by the middle of 2016. But going forward, because of economic recovery in the US, that will likely go to stronger exports from Asian countries, particularly from Singapore. "
 
However experts said the Sing dollar is likely to strengthen against regional currencies like the ringgit and rupiah over the course of 2016, given the Singapore economy's stronger economic fundamentals.
 
“It’s not a function of rate hike, it's really their domestic factors,” said Mr Jack Wang, a partner at Raffles Investment. “For Indonesia, it's pretty much the concerns about the inflation, which is pretty high - it can reach double digits. For Malaysia, it's more of an impact of low oil prices, as well as the reputation - the credit rating of the country. So really, I think the domestic factors will play a role. The macro environment has not been very favourable to them.”

While it has not been explicitly stated, the trajectory for the RMB is downwards for near to mid-term. China is trying to move herself up the value chain; services have become a larger contributor to its economic performance numbers. However exports are still a critical component and the RMB devaluation is necessary to boost that sector in order to keep overall growth within expectations.
 
 
Now China is the main player and will be the rising stars.

But if it's due soon, suggest you don't put for so long cos there should be a revision upwards soon but Singapore Finance industry reacts slowly when raising rates for deposit. Obviously, they are quick to raise rates for loan though lol.

My fixed D with Hong Leong is due today and just came back from signing up a new package with them.
 
Take note the 1.99% is only valid if you deposit 200k with them for 1.5 years.
 
However, with interest rates due to rise, I didn't opt for 18 months. I choose the 13 months instead with 1.91% interest as I feel other banks such as CIMB and Maybank may match and up their offer.

One may wish to consider this view:
 
a. sign up for a SGD ANZ Statement Savings Account: https://sg.anz.com/apps/wealth/offer/
 
The current promotion rate is between 1.3% to 1.55% pa, depending on the quantum placed in there (no lock-in based on what I know)
 
b. assuming the best FD rates right now in the market are 1.99% (with 1.5 years lock-in)
 
c. the difference per annum is between (1.99% - 1.55%) = 0.44% to (1.99% - 1.3%) = 0.69% 
 
d. the difference per month respectively is from (0.44% / 12) = 0.0367% to (0.69% / 12) = 0.0575%
 
Given that interest rates are rising now (with a target increase of 100+ basis points by end 2016), the difference of 0.0575% to 0.0367% per month of interest is somewhat insufficient to justify the opportunity cost of locking the funds in an FD for 1.5 years. 
 
To put into perspective, on a $10k quantum, the difference per month is only around $3 to $5 of interest, not worthwhile to sacrifice liquidity for a tiny bit of higher interest. 
 
Just my two cents.
 

My fixed D with Hong Leong is due today and just came back from signing up a new package with them.
 
Take note the 1.99% is only valid if you deposit 200k with them for 1.5 years.
 
However, with interest rates due to rise, I didn't opt for 18 months. I choose the 13 months instead with 1.91% interest as I feel other banks such as CIMB and Maybank may match and up their offer.

Personally i don't like to go to town just to do banking stuff.
i just take what the local banks can offer which are available in the suburbs.
 
i agree, i guess most of us aren't planning to do anything with our $ for the next 1-2 years anyway
 
 

One may wish to consider this view:
 
a. sign up for a SGD ANZ Statement Savings Account: https://sg.anz.com/apps/wealth/offer/
 
The current promotion rate is between 1.3% to 1.55% pa, depending on the quantum placed in there (no lock-in based on what I know)

An internet banking account would be your most valuable tool.  
 
TTs, FDs, TDs, etc can be accessed on most internet banking platforms now.

For those of us who got spare cash n also CPF savings whilst servicing a private housing loan n if you've gotten a favorable fixed rate signed up, I would not partial or fully repay the loan at anytime since CPF paying 2.5% and likely your FD yielding higher than the fixed housing loan rate (UOB n OCBC previously giving 1.68% though now higher).
 
In fact, I would use cash to pay the installments (after putting aside emergency funds-typically at least 6mths) rather than CPF to maximize the good CPF interest returns. After all, when we have build up sufficiently in the years ahead, we can wipe out our CPF plus abit of cash if required.
 
The alternative way of paying installments with CPF only will mean that all things being equal, our total savings will be lesser after a few years vs paying via cash. I know it's useful to have cash in hand rather than a sizeable CPF balance but as the funds are meant to pay off the housing loan eventually, the 1st method of using cash is the better way economically, my 2 cents.......

quite standard to request for fresh funds also.
 
I rather lump sum transfer via cashier's order and get my deposit slip there and then.
Cos with FAST transfer, daily transfer rate at 5k/day, I'd rather not transfer the money in over a period of few days then have a cockup.

Even if you manage to increase the FAST limit also no point unless you are only putting a small amount in FD.

If pay cash+cpf, then could avoid hitting CPF withdrawal limit at later stage.
In case hit by early retirement, cpf got money but cannot be used to pay the outstanding property loan.

Can draw out CPF to pay down housing just before reaching 55 years old?
 
In the meantime use cash, with CPF as backup, to gain the interests as Bro @Spring described (can't praise him again)?

but if at 53-54 year old, and retired. Cannot withdraw cpf money yet.
No fix income but HDB loan still outstanding 2-3 years.
cpf withdrawal limit already 120% of value.
 
So, Sprint's suggestion is good. Pay with cash in the early years.

Of course using cash has its drawbacks as well eg for emergencies and that's why the 6 mths rule of thumb emergency fund or even more should always be set aside, so  good point.
 
Idea is that it's faster to build up your savings by paying installments by cash instead of CPF or at least more cash where possible as the returns are far greater in CPF compared to the pittance in FDs for cash.

If you have already paid up 20-30% of valuation (say half or even fully by cash), does that give you leeway to pay more up to valuation limit of 120%?
 
Food for thought will be what if say 2019, cash deposit interests go up to 3 or 4% above OA interest of 2.5%?

Assuming value is $300k.
CPF limit is $360k.
This includes interest we pay monthly.
If interest rate is 2.5%, after 10 years, we would have used 25% of the limit, just for the interest.
So, by 18-19 years, we would have reach the limit.
If we re-pay a little bit using cash, we could delay reaching the limit to 22-23 years.
 
You forgot that, OA interest is peg to market interest rate.
If market rate raise to 3% or 4%, OA interest will be closed to 3% or 4%.
If not, there will be demo at Hong Lim park already.

What's the difference here? When you can't pay up, the bank isn't going to care which property is for you to live in and which is your investment. They'll just take possession and sell it till they get their money back.

Fed awakens, but event lacks drama
 
Aaron Low
Deputy Business Editor
PUBLISHED DEC 18, 2015, 5:00 AM SGT
 
The effects of the gradual interest rate hike are not expected to be of great concern in Singapore
 
 
Almost 10 years on, and after the recent months of tense anticipation, it finally happened yesterday.
 
Star Wars: The Force Awakens premiered in Singapore.
 
Oh, and the United States Federal Reserve also raised rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
 
he movie, according to critics, is a tribute to the old trilogy, filled with drama and left audiences crying out for more.
 
The other event lacked drama, with lines delivered by a white- haired woman in a purple suit.
 
Boring or not, chances are the Fed will be the story that many people will be paying attention to for years to come.
 
 
Early yesterday morning, the Fed raised interest rates by 0.25 of a percentage point, marking the end of a seven-year period in which rates were close to zero.
 
In doing so, Fed chair Janet Yellen expressed confidence in the US domestic economy while emphasising that future rate hikes are likely to be gradual.
 
"The committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the Federal Funds rate; the rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run," said the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets US monetary policy.
 
Markets, which rose on the news, cheered the "dovish" language employed by the Fed, as this means that the world will continue to enjoy low interest rates for years to come.
 
Projections put the US interest rate at 3.5 per cent by 2019.
 
The effects of the gradual interest rate hike are not expected to be of great concern in Singapore.
 
First, the pace of hikes from here on will be gradual. Second, there will be both winners and losers from the increases, and it is hard to say if there will be a net positive or negative impact on the economy.
 
One of the biggest worries here is the impact of a rate hike on the property market, with households holding the bulk of their wealth in real estate.
 
Mr Kelvin Tay, UBS regional chief investment officer for southern Asia Pacific, expects the Singapore interbank offered rate (Sibor), a benchmark rate that determines many mortgages here, to rise to 2 per cent by the end of next year, up from about 1.13 per cent yesterday.
 
But the gradual rate hike will reduce stress to the system more than raise risks within it.
 
Last month, the Monetary Authority of Singapore released its review of the financial system and produced two stress tests to check if rising rates will have a big impact.
 
For individuals, even if mortgage rates were to rise to 5 per cent, most households would still be able to service their loans.
 
A gradual rise in rates will make people think twice about overstretching to buy an expensive property.
 
The outlook for businesses was less optimistic, with many Asian and Singaporean firms holding high levels of debt. But tests also showed that most corporate balance sheets remain resilient.
 
On the flip side, savers, who have been punished by negative real returns, will benefit as deposit rates will rise.
 
The second channel that affects Singapore directly is through the foreign exchange market.
 
The US dollar is expected to rally strongly against its trading partners, Singapore included.
 
Yesterday, the greenback rose by nearly 0.7 per cent against the Singdollar to $1.4168, so consumers buying from Amazon or studying overseas will have to stump up more.
 
But this is offset by the potential upside to exports, which have been suffering from the slowing global economy. A cheaper Singdollar will make our goods more competitive.
 
What is more worrying here is whether the rate hike will induce further bouts of volatility that could hurt sentiment all round.
 
In particular, if growth in emerging markets continues to falter, there could be serious questions asked about the large debt that corporates in countries such as China and Brazil have taken on.
 
Emerging market corporate debt worth US$600 billion (S$849 billion) is due next year, with half expected to be up for refinancing, said the Institute of International Finance.
 
If growth remains tepid and financing costs rise too quickly, the debt problem could blow up.
 
That could cause another bout of market volatility that no one really wants to experience.
 
In this regard, there is no harm opting for a more boring approach to a major plotline, especially when the Fed is with you.

RISE IN HOME LOAN INTEREST RATES MAY HIT HIM BAD
MAN BURNED BY BAD INVESTMENT WORRIED ABOUT RISE IN INTEREST RATES
  
Jan 4, 2016 6:00am
BY TAN TAM MEI
 
He took out loans and mortgaged his three-bedroom condominium unit to invest in property overseas, thinking that he could get rich quick.
But Mr Lim ended up over $600,000 in debt and with a $400,000 mortgage when the overseas developer went missing in 2011.
Two years ago, Mr Lim approached Credit Counselling Singapore, which helps people with debt problems. They helped him negotiate a monthly payment plan of $8,000 to creditors for a term of seven years to pay off his debt.
Mr Lim is also servicing a mortgage of about $2,200 at an interest rate of around 1.8 per cent. Mr Lim's family of four live on a tight budget and an increase in mortgage rates is the last thing they need.
But following the United States' Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates last month, home loan and mortgage rates in Singapore are also set to rise. 
Home loan and mortgage rates are usually based on the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (Sibor), which moves in tandem with US interest rates.
"I hope the increase (in interest rates) is not steep, one per cent a year is still all right and we can stomach that," said Mr Lim.
"But if it's three per cent... I will probably have to ask my children to chip in more."
Mr Lim's two older children are working and help shoulder about 35 per cent of the household monthly expenditure.
Mr Lim declined to reveal his salary, but said he is only able to make the various bill payments with the help of his children.
His youngest child will complete her university education this year and he hopes that she, too, will be able to help out financially when she enters the workforce.
He said: "I'm their father, I will feel bad asking them (to contribute more money) for this mistake. Our budget is very tight and we're already stretched to the limit. We have already cut down to the bare bones, no restaurants, less entertainment and less shopping."
 
 
Four things home owners should know
Home owners with existing loans pegged to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (Sibor) are likely to find themselves paying more for their mortgages in 2016, said housing and financial experts.
Most housing loans are set at a certain percentage above Sibor and a rising Sibor rate will equate to an increase in interest payments, said Mizuho Bank's senior economist Vishnu Varathan.
He said that because Sibor moves in tandem with United States interest rates, the US Federal Reserve's announcement last month that it would increase interest rates by 0.25 to 0.5 per cent will definitely affect Singapore's interest rates.
Mr Varathan predicted that Sibor will increase by about 0.75 to 1.25 per cent more than prevailing rates over the course of this year.
 
So what should home owners here know about the increase in Sibor and what can they do to mitigate it?
DON'T PANIC
Sibor has been increasing gradually over the past year and the US Federal Reserve announcement has been a long time coming, said ECG Property chief executive Eric Cheng, 40.
Mr Cheng said that although home owners will be paying more for their loans and saving less, the interest rates are still fundamentally stable.
"It's a gradual and progressive increase in interest rates, so if you're a prudent investor and you have planned well, you'll be able to handle the increase," he said.
The increase in interest rates is a "normalisation and not a hike", said a spokesman from SRX Property .
"Interest rates have been very low for too many years, so this increase is actually allowing rates to go back to normal," he said.
 
LOOK FOR REFINANCING OR REPRICING ALTERNATIVES
Home owners should look for alternatives to their current home loan packages, said Mr Ong Kah Seng, director of property market research company R'ST Research.
"They should research and find alternatives and other resources," he said.
"It's good to know the options, because switching interest rate packages or refinancing might not always be the best choice.
"Sometimes, sticking to their current loans will be better."
Mr Ong said that home owners should take this as a chance to become more informed about their loan options as "it's a danger to be a passive home owner".
 
DON'T INVEST BEYOND WHAT YOU CAN
Everyone will eventually be affected by the interest rate increase, but investors who do their numbers well won't be as severely affected.
"Those who are most affected by the Sibor increase are those heavily geared or invested in property," said Mr Cheng.
"They may have taken loans larger than what they can finance."
Property investment blogger and founder of Property Club Singapore, Ms Vina Ip, advised home owners to consider multiple factors of their property investments.
A combination of factors such as market oversupply, a lucklustre rental market and high vacancy rate can result in more mortgage defaults, she said.
 
BE FLEXIBLE
To mitigate the increase in Sibor, investors with vacant properties should be more flexible.
With the dismal rental market, they should lower expectations for rental fees and tenants' profiles, said Mr Ong. Any rental can help negate the increase in Sibor.
He said: "Their top priority should be to get tenants to fill up the space for at least one or two years."

Home owners with existing loans pegged to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (Sibor) are likely to find themselves paying more for their mortgages in 2016, said housing and financial experts.
Most housing loans are set at a certain percentage above Sibor and a rising Sibor rate will equate to an increase in interest payments, said Mizuho Bank's senior economist Vishnu Varathan.
He said that because Sibor moves in tandem with United States interest rates, the US Federal Reserve's announcement last month that it would increase interest rates by 0.25 to 0.5 per cent will definitely affect Singapore's interest rates.
Mr Varathan predicted that Sibor will increase by about 0.75 to 1.25 per cent more than prevailing rates over the course of this year.
 
So what should home owners here know about the increase in Sibor and what can they do to mitigate it?
DON'T PANIC
Sibor has been increasing gradually over the past year and the US Federal Reserve announcement has been a long time coming, said ECG Property chief executive Eric Cheng, 40.
Mr Cheng said that although home owners will be paying more for their loans and saving less, the interest rates are still fundamentally stable.
"It's a gradual and progressive increase in interest rates, so if you're a prudent investor and you have planned well, you'll be able to handle the increase," he said.
The increase in interest rates is a "normalisation and not a hike", said a spokesman from SRX Property .
"Interest rates have been very low for too many years, so this increase is actually allowing rates to go back to normal," he said.
 
LOOK FOR REFINANCING OR REPRICING ALTERNATIVES
Home owners should look for alternatives to their current home loan packages, said Mr Ong Kah Seng, director of property market research company R'ST Research.
"They should research and find alternatives and other resources," he said.
"It's good to know the options, because switching interest rate packages or refinancing might not always be the best choice.
"Sometimes, sticking to their current loans will be better."
Mr Ong said that home owners should take this as a chance to become more informed about their loan options as "it's a danger to be a passive home owner".
 
DON'T INVEST BEYOND WHAT YOU CAN
Everyone will eventually be affected by the interest rate increase, but investors who do their numbers well won't be as severely affected.
"Those who are most affected by the Sibor increase are those heavily geared or invested in property," said Mr Cheng.
"They may have taken loans larger than what they can finance."
Property investment blogger and founder of Property Club Singapore, Ms Vina Ip, advised home owners to consider multiple factors of their property investments.
A combination of factors such as market oversupply, a lucklustre rental market and high vacancy rate can result in more mortgage defaults, she said.
 
BE FLEXIBLE
To mitigate the increase in Sibor, investors with vacant properties should be more flexible.
With the dismal rental market, they should lower expectations for rental fees and tenants' profiles, said Mr Ong. Any rental can help negate the increase in Sibor.
He said: "Their top priority should be to get tenants to fill up the space for at least one or two years."

I think his children may not want him to declare bankruptcy.
 
If I am not wrong, with outstanding bank loan, the bank can repossess and sell away his home at current values to cover his debts if he is declared a bankrupt.
 
Ultimately, if he redeems his loan, the children will get to inherit a portion one day? 
 
Win-win for parent and children?

Like I posted above, it depends on whether he is solvent or not.
 
If he will still owe money after liquidation by the bank, then he can consider declaring bankrupt.
 
If there is still equity remaining or close to break even then might as well just keep paying and hope property values go up?

inherit what? as a father in a household u shoulder a very heavy responsibility. 600k in debts, 400k in mortgage. bad mistake and decision in life is ok, just move on and shoulder that responsibility.

He mortgaged out his 3BR condo, and has 400K mortgage left for this property.
 
600K debt is because of the misadventure with the property overseas (likely those scams where the developer or manager runs off).
 
It is probable that he can sell everything (for 1million or more) and clear all his debts and mortgage, but where should he stay?
 
The children will have to end up taking care of him in the end. It's a catch 22 situation, but I am sure they have done some damage control in this decision.

True.
 
If bank loan, they will take back very fast.
 
HDB loan, can stretch for quite a few months more. But ultimately don't pay, means HDB can buy back from you and sell at market rate.
 
Fully paid HDB is the most secure one - your creditors at most can come and paste stamp at your furniture and electrical appliances but they cannot do anything much beyond that.

That's for bank housing loan only.  Only the bank which you are getting your housing loan can repossess your HDB flat.
If you run into debts outside, they cannot demand you sell your HDB.
 
If on CPF loan, even safer.. probably can default for 1 yr, get MP to write letter, pay off 1 month, then default another year.

One of the examples highlighted, the HDB was paid in full (without loans). The owner had 5 private properties. 
 
Should we give him chance like warning for him to abuse his HDB for such illegal rentals even though there are no loans?

I said before, HDB should never be for rental.
You just buy it to stay.
If you become rich and you buy condos, that is fine, but you must stay in your HDB.
The moment it is rented out and not used, it has gone against the principles, imo
 
Moreover you highlighted that its illegal, so why want to give chance, just confiscate the HDB lah.
Who cares if fully paid or not?  It belongs to the State, the Nation, the People.

So shd refinance or reprice now?
 
I'm also facing dilemma if shd do a repricing for a fixed rate for 2 years, but actually now I'm also paying slightly lower than the 2-year fixed rate on offer and out of lock in period.
 
Moreover the IR I'm paying is still below the CPF interest rate now, and need to fork out $1k to reprice..

This also shows how low interest rate are for so many years already.. It is really very low.

Yes! this is the current predicament especially from US FED announcement yesterday where NOTHING was mentioned on rates hike instead of further notice or status quo!
but the big question here is . . .  will our local banks stop digesting the recent broad and rates hikes from last years news?  hell NO! . . .
other NOA's big banks have already 're-adjust' their recent rates back to or even lower than 2015, but except ours!
 
with all the tight measures, conversatives earnings, precautionary measures, volatile financial markets - the domestic sectors here should readlly review their rates instead of maintaing their stands......
 
I guess 1.68% SIBOR and 1.95%FL should be the market benchamrk for now . . . . Any banks with better rates than this????

One sure thing we can interpret it right is that when US Fed sniffs a 0.25% interest rate hike . . . All local banks here 快手快脚, "Ho Sei Liao" immediately rose their overall rates to all year high! Now if trends go for -ve rates hike . . . . You think our local banks will follow the same immediately like they did earlier?????

US Fed - Negative interest rates "possible" but "no plans yet".

Different news interpret what she said differently.

Reduce interest rate to near zero do not work as it only delay the problem and make it bigger. Now near zero interest rate cannot work lao, and they are all going negative interest rate. With these kind of policy, we are just compounding the problem.

One of the examples highlighted, the HDB was paid in full (without loans). The owner had 5 private properties. 
 
Should we give him chance like warning for him to abuse his HDB for such illegal rentals even though there are no loans?

You know my stance about people using HDBs to profiteer.
I say just confiscate!

Ocbc FD rate is 1.7-1.8%, borrow at 1.75%, loan out at 1.63%, yet need to pay all the high labour & rental cost, can survive?
News just out, auction by banks up another 80%, if property plunges down due to global economy collapse, already can see with oil price plunges & DB near bankrupt now, will they follow the path of DB?
All know DBS has super high loan to oil & gas sector, many will be in huge trouble if oil price continue to below $30 & oil price will go below US$10 eventually.
Accompany with property meltdown fast now, can see in HK, Taipei & most asian cities now with huge funds puling out from asia now.

that's why StanChart (owned by Temasek) oledi liquidate almost all their investments related to oil...... including those funds section & its resources . . . . excepts GCT's son (shhhh!)
 
what I'm afraid is . . .  the big 4s relied too much on domestic loans may insist on their board rates (to keep them afloat) instead of going the US FED's way....... making all local to suffer more on refinancing their loans! 
 
Really?  OCBC's FD rate at 1.7 - 1.8%, and Sibor at 1.63% ????
do you think it will go further down (at least back to 2013's)?

standchart offers the best sibor rate; 1.6 - 1.65 without lock-in, compared to 1.8 - 2.3 from many banks in begining of this year
dbs gives the best fixed rates at 1.8 and beats ocbc (think ocbc may have something next)
 
yes, sibor is on downward trent though bank analyst continues to smoke all by saying us economy recovery may lead to their rates hikes by year end reconciliation
and since big 4s here also survive in local domestic markets, they'd still bank on adjusting their board rates to keep their profit afloats
but to instill ''kiasu'' to local borrowers on the abovementioned is quite a bs, really....

Those home loan experts and finance guru who spread fear about spiking interest rate (9 mth ago) and advised home owners to lock in for 3 yr fixed rate are the real winners. Now loan rates back to sub 2%, those who locked in are paying more.

Just got a letter for revision of home loan interest rates (3.0 to 3.5%) 
 
I'm thinking of doing a repricing.
 
But should I go for floating 0.75% + SIBOR rates (revised every 3months) (1yr locked in)
 
OR
 
1% + SIBOR rates (capped at 1.49% if SIBOR goes high) (locked in 3yrs)
 
Any suggestions?

 
Quote this historic 2012 thread starter, back in the good old days when bank loans were at 3.0 - 3.5%. Will bank loans reach 3.0% in 2017?

Bopian, that was in Jan 2012 after a solid year of GDP growth of 4.9% in 2011, of course banks charged more, especially for Sibor which is more volatile.
 
It's either we have a solid 2017 growth of above 3% and interest rate of 3%, or a sluggish year of sub 2% growth and interest rate of 2%. 
 
Interest rate is not a suka suka up or down thingy.
 
But those who listened to me earlier only need to wake up at 2019 to see where the world is at.

yup! best refinancing period was May, June, July 2016 where most banks were faced with uncertainties on world economic outcomes.....
especially when SIBOR kept on raising since 2015's Q2 to 2016's Q1 aimlessly until major banks declared their loss in commercial bankings..... DBS, StandChart etc.
and the yankies kept delaying interest hikes but still continued to confuse markets just to stabilize their own fears from their coming election
our local home loans became competitive among local banks to secure their shares domestically until hypes on US election in Q3....
now, bloody yankies not even raised the rates last Wed, they even declared further hikes to 0.25 - 0.75 across next 2yrs to stimulate their USD 
(this actually benefits exports from both china & europe!)
this catalyses our local banks to up their interest rates across next Q2, Q3 & even Q4 !!!
they even scrapped their fixed rates deals; the best rates ever since Q2 this year !
 
so its best to go fixed rates (oledi high now) rather SIBOR coz I am VERY SURE all local banks here will raise their board rates (on top of SIBOR) at least twice to thrice next year !!!!!

It could be a conspiracy but there is a conventional explanation to it.  
 
US economy is in recovery for years and unemployment rate has dropped to below 5%, some say it is close to full employment and rate would have to rise, albeit not aggressively.
 
Along came Trump, who is an expansionist and also protectionist, meaning he will pump prime the US economy (cut tax, spend on infrastructure and probably borrow a lot of monies to do it, all of which leads to higher long term interest rate), so US interest rate is now projected to rise more aggressively, from 2 hikes next year to 3.  If Trump can get Congress to support his tax cut and spending programme, US interest rate may rise even faster than what we are anticipating now. It is all about market perception and expectation.  
 
With US economy recovering and possibly growing stronger due to pump priming and possible protectionist measures, monies of course flow out from higher risk Asia (we are mostly exporters) to invest in US assets with potentially higher returns (not just equity but to buy properties, businesses, US treasuries, USD, etc.).  Outflow of fund... regional currencies weaken along with SGD and of course local interest rate starts to rise (double whammy actually, US interest rate and USD/SGD exchange rate are both determinants of local interest rate).
 
Go lock in fixed rate, at least 3 years, for peace of mind before the banks start to revise their offering, some have already done so.  Just my view from what I read and hear in the market, if rates don't go up, don't blame me.  Lol...

Banks drop some fixed-rate home loans amid interest rate uncertainty
Dec 29, 2016
 
A number of fixed-rate mortgage plans have been pulled from the shelves lately, as banks grapple with uncertainty over the pace of interest rate hikes.
 
Market watchers noted that several banks are trying to ensure their margins are not squeezed by cheaply priced fixed-rate packages.
 
Ms Grace Cheng, co-founder of personal finance website GET.com, told The Straits Times: "For example, Maybank removed its two-year, 1.6 per cent fixed- rate package in mid-November."
 
She said that earlier this week, Bank of China removed its two-year fixed-rate packages, starting from 1.4 per cent, while DBS removed its five-year, 1.99 per cent fixed-rate package.
 
A DBS spokesman said the five-year offer ended because it was only a temporary promotion.
 
DBS has a three-year, 1.88 per cent fixed-rate loan, while OCBC is offering a two-year, 2.38 per cent loan.
 
United Overseas Bank (UOB) has one of the best fixed-rate offers in town - a two-year, 1.8 per cent loan - but apparently not for long. MoneySmart.sg chief executive Vinod Nair said this deal has Jan 1 as its last submission date.

Go lock in fixed rate, at least 3 years, for peace of mind before the banks start to revise their offering, some have already done so. Just my view from what I read and hear in the market, if rates don't go up, don't blame me. Lol...

 
But I am cash rich, so I should hold for interest rate goes up then bank them in?  Just joking. The situation here maybe differ from other countries, there is no biz thus banks are not attracting investors. Just look at our FD rates, it is the lowest in many years. I am not economist but I don't think Trump blowing hot and cold can work for them. If they do what he suggested  their era is over faster than Obama is trying to delay.

It could be a conspiracy but there is a conventional explanation to it.
 
US economy is in recovery for years and unemployment rate has dropped to below 5%, some say it is close to full employment and rate would have to rise, albeit not aggressively.
 
Along came Trump, who is an expansionist and also protectionist, meaning he will pump prime the US economy (cut tax, spend on infrastructure and probably borrow a lot of monies to do it, all of which leads to higher long term interest rate), so US interest rate is now projected to rise more aggressively, from 2 hikes next year to 3. If Trump can get Congress to support his tax cut and spending programme, US interest rate may rise even faster than what we are anticipating now. It is all about market perception and expectation.

Not everything is about maths, broTrue but there is no risk (CPF is safer than banks, I hope) and assuming your loan is fully back by cash in CPF, it is free money.   
Some like to hold the title deed and declare the house(s) belong to him or her. I don't have such a need. Anyway, I only full cash car, not enough to full cash my house.  Lol

Finally found a topic I can tag on.
 
Currently on OCBC for my home loan. Reprice is due. I intend to stay on OCBC convenience and not re-mortgage to another bank.
 
They have offered me the following packages:
 
1) Fixed (2 year lock)1.85% (OHR Fixed + 0.85%)1.85% (OHR Fixed + 0.85%)1.90% (OHR + 0.90%)2.00% (OHR + 1.00%)2) Floating (2 year lock)1.65% (OHR + 0.65%)1.65% (OHR + 0.65%)1.70% (OHR + 0.70%)1.80% (OHR + 0.80%)
 
According to web sources, the OHR is a 12year moving average of 1mth n 3 mth Sibor. Recently sibor has moved up and many mortgage gurus and mortgage brokers say that even if sibor goes up steady n gradually in the next 2-3years, the 12year moving OHR will unlikely to move.
 
For package 1, OCBC fixed the OHR, meaning OHR will not move at all
 
For package 2, OCBC does not fix OHR, so there may be a possibility they play out the end user and move it.
 
In both package, OCBC in house mortgage banker say the spread (the other component of the package) will not be amended thoughout the contract.
 
Asking all sifus here, which package would you all take if?
 
Thanks in advance!

They can't unilaterally move it unless there is some collusion between the banks to fix the SIBOR. And even then, the impact on you will be limited (less than 10% since you said it is a 12 year moving average). You should check what the SIBOR was 12 and 11 years ago and compare with what you think the rate will be 2 years into the future since those are the 2 years that will change in a moving average calculation.
 
Disclosure: I have no idea what OHR actually is. Just using your definition of it.

Thank for your inputs. 
My understanding is that OHR is internally determined, like board rates. They have the right to change their definition and how they computr their moving average or over how many years.

I am intending to reprice one of my OCBC mortgage as well. Already run for two years and currently at 1.68% (or 1.78%) for another year.

You got offered the same packages as me? 
What's your take on OCBC playing the consumer out and revise the floating OHR and the spread during the lock in period?
 
I was played out on their floating board rates 1 year into the current loan and now paying 2.38%. quite pissed off.

They are not likely to change the spread once confirmed.
 
Even if they change the computation, it may be like shortened to 6 year or 10 year Sibor rates. 
 
Hard to say what banks will do if Sibor goes up to say 3% in a couple of years. Have to take the bet accordingly.
 
But supposing Sibor goes down way lower, you will still stay at 1%+ spread, which means above 1.7%. Those who float with the 1month or 3month Sibor will benefit more in that scenario.

Spread if dun chg I happy. 
OHR if they chg I will be upset. Like u said, they may chg how to compute OHR.
 
Us Fed will raise rates. Sibor expected to rise. Is how much OCBC wanna earn and tekan the borrower by changing how OHR is computed or adjust OHR and/or spread of the not fixed package in the 2 year lock in period only.
 
Will u go the non fixed OHR package?

More important is whether you believe interest rates for private property at the broad level, can it exceed 2.6%? 
If you think it can then go fixed. If you think it cannot, then float. 
 
I personally have trouble believing that with the USD depreciation. So I can float and jump boat if they raise anyhow. Many banks want to earn this money.

MAS does check for fixing and hence this was returned.
 
SINGAPORE — The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has returned about S$10 billion in temporary fines levied on 19 banks, including the three local lenders it disciplined last year as part of a sweeping global probe into the alleged manipulation of financial benchmarks and foreign exchange rates.
The regulator said the lenders, which include DBS, United Overseas Bank (UOB), Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC), UBS, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Royal Bank of Scotland and Deutsche Bank, had done enough to help prevent a repeat of past failings.
In response to a Financial Times query on whether the banks had received their money back now that the 12-month period for the temporary fines had passed, the central bank said: “The MAS has returned the additional statutory reserves to the 19 banks.”
It added: “These banks have completed the remedial actions to strengthen the governance, internal controls and surveillance systems for their benchmark submissions and trading operations.”

Economy overheated, property prices and stocks overheated, almost like emerging and developing countries. Property indices rise 30-50%. Currency and interest rate movements cannot curb the continued rise in prices, resulting in interest rate doubling.

If SIBOR doubles, interest rates still less than 3% right? Historically, that's normal.
 
Anyone who has taken their loan in recent years would have been assessed using the TDSR formula and assuming no loss of income be able to handle these interest increases. 
 
Current low rates unfairly punish savers and encourage excess consumption. With higher interest rates, property prices will also be moderated.

High prices discourage excess consumption. Low rates is necessary due to global money printing. The huge liquidity has found its way to many types of bonds and shares. It’s unfortunate for savers but it’s the way the authorities worldwide had chosen to fix the financial upheaval.

Don't worry, the banks will be kind to those who need to buy, coz they cannot collapse right? But we all know that kindness comes with a price. As for the govt, keeping the people in debt is their ongoing objective so that economy (more like the banks) can continue thriving. :)

They charge interest and try to ensure borrowers can afford. Raising interests blindly just brings your clients to the rival bank.

You are wrong. Banks and govt won't hesitate to increase interest rates, they only need people to keep working like a dog to service their loans just to keep the musical chairs going. You think the high wage low interest environment will persist forever?

And yes, they would not hesitate to increase, if the demand is overwhelmingly hot and unable to be cooled even after index rose by dozens of %. The other case is extreme SGD depreciation. Are you sure these are the outcomes you desire?

For the past 10 years,  govt busy selling land to developers.  If interest rate increase too fast, pty demand goes down, developers stop bidding land, govt suffer right? GLS slowing down now,  causing developers to look towards enbloc. The time is almost ripe for an interest rate hike.

Just remember huge price rise will lead to huge interest rate increase.
 
Low interest rates occur because from a macro perspective, the plan was to stimulate weak demand.

Just look around for how dense the build up is and how many more pieces of land left. 
Furiously reclaiming and taking back Golf courses, cemeteries urgently.
 
And land sales proceeds go into reserves and not to the people, whereas in enbloc, power is returned to the private property owners.

Actually the world is fixing interest rates for us. The liquidity already fixed the interest rate. Stopped printing more, but the liquidity is still out there for a long time.
 
We never deliberately fix interest rates. We set exchange rate.
 
And if refer to the major banks in the world, they are barely rising, some are still zero or negative.

GST hike comes first, 1% increase equals more than a billion revenue for the govt a year. As for interest rate, the govt will save the best for last, slowly but surely.

The main control is not interest rate but of exchange rate.

3. HOW DOES MAS MANAGE ITS MONETARY POLICY?
Most countries, including the United States and China, adopt an interest rate policy where central banks raise or cut interest rates.
Singapore is the only major economy in the world to use the exchange rate, guiding the Singdollar higher or lower.
MAS says the exchange rate is the best tool for a small, open economy like Singapore. It is a more effective way to manage inflation, as much of the country's consumer goods are imported.
 
4. SO IF MAS DOES NOT SET INTEREST RATES IN SINGAPORE, WHO DOES?
MAS has effectively given up control of domestic interest rates. Instead, borrowing costs are largely determined by US interest rates and investors' expectations of the future movement of the Singapore dollar.
5. HOW DOES MAS' EXCHANGE-RATE POLICY WORK?
MAS lets the Singdollar rise or fall against an undisclosed basket of currencies of its main trading partners, intervening when needed to keep the exchange rate within its unspecified target band.
To deter speculation and be more effective, MAS does not disclose what is in its basket of currencies or specify its trading band.
It adjusts the pace of appreciation or depreciation of the Singdollar by changing the slope, width and centre of this trading band.
The exchange rate that MAS targets is trade weighted such that the currencies of Singapore's larger trading partners bear more weight. This trade-weighted exchange rate is known as the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate or S$NEER.

Instead of weaker SGD and higher interest rates, we ended up with a stronger SGD and not really much higher interest rate.

You have said it, borrowing cost in singapore is determined by US interest rates, you may want to look at the correlation between sibor and US interest rate hike from 1987 until now.

True of sorts. But there are many major shifts in recent times that decreases the link with US Fed interest rates.

Great recap for the uninitiated
 
 
http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/low-interest-rates-are-here-to-stayLow interest rates are here to stayNoah SmithPUBLISHED OCT 22, 2015, 5:00 AM SGTWhy are interest rates so low? For macroeconomists, this is one of the Big Questions in the world today.Government bond rates are at or near record lows. So are corporate bond rates, including junk bonds. Even the cost of equity capital is at or near an all-time low for most businesses. Whether you're a government, a big corporation or a tiny start-up, it has never been cheaper to obtain capital.Interest rates have been in decline since the early 1980s. For a while, that looked like a simple regression to the mean. The early 1980s saw central banks tighten a lot, driving up rates in an effort to rein in inflation. But the decline during the past 15 years or so - and especially since the financial crisis - goes way beyond a simple normalisation. Something unusual is happening.That's worrying for macroeconomists, because it means old theories may be wrong. It's also worrying for central bankers because it constrains their actions (nominal interest rates can't be pushed below zero) even as it increases the uncertainty under which they are forced to make their decisions.So why are rates so bizarrely low? Interest rates are set in markets, where borrowers meet lenders (broadly defined). Any explanation for falling rates must involve an increased desire to lend, a decreased desire to borrow, or both. One common theory is that central banks are responsible. This makes sense to most people, since we all hear that the US Federal Reserve, or the Bank of Japan, has a policy of holding interest rates near zero. But just because central banks are setting their rate targets at zero doesn't mean they have to work very hard to achieve that target.There are reasons to think that central banks are not the big driver of low rates. First, it isn't just nominal rates that are historically low, but real inflation-adjusted rates too. Most economists believe real interest rates can't be affected by monetary policy for very long.Second, most economists think that if central banks are holding rates below what private markets want, we should be seeing high inflation. We're not. And finally, the end of the Fed's bond-buying programme of quantitative easing seemed to have only a small effect.So are low rates being driven by a savings glut? That was the famous hypothesis of former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke in 2005. The idea was that developing countries - for example, China - were saving more than they were investing, and that the excess capital was flowing into the United States, and lowering borrowing costs. Since the financial crisis, savings rates have risen in the US as well - households are squirrelling away more, and corporations are famously hoarding cash. The savings glut might have gone global.Another reason for low rates - an underrated reason, I suspect - could come from the demand side of the equation. The desire to borrow money clearly seems low across the world. Households in the US and other countries that suffered a big housing bust have large overhangs of debt, and the crash showed them that debt was more dangerous than they had realised. Companies in Europe are clearly reluctant to borrow to invest, given the running political uncertainty surrounding the euro and the sovereign debts of countries such as Greece. That probably applies to Japan as well.In addition, these rich countries have steeply declining populations, and shrinking domestic markets discourage companies from expanding. As for US companies, they may be holding back investment because of fears of weakness in export markets. China is slowing, and with it many other developing countries.Another factor may be the recent wave of technological disruptions that make it harder for firms to plan ahead. Big investments require big bets, and in an era of massive disruption, no one knows which bets to place. And even as disruption is increasing, overall productivity is slowing.So what will stem the tide of low interest rates? I wouldn't count on central banks to do the job. As long as private markets keep pushing rates down, central bankers are not going to risk causing recessions by trying to raise them. Nor are firms going to suddenly become brave and bold around the world.There are some factors that may stop the downward slide. American households will eventually work off their debt overhang - already, the housing market is recovering. At the same time, China is also rebalancing towards a more consumption-based economy. That should do a bit to drain the savings glut, at least whenChina's current sharp slowdown has run its course.But long-term trends - declining global population growth and continued technological disruption - point to a very long period of low interest rates.BLOOMBERG VIEW

I expect Fed to make at least 1 more rate cut this year, and possibly another one again next year.  Hence, I think floating rate is better than fixed rate in the next 1-2 years.
