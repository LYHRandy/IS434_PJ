Flat owners and their families must continue to stay in their HDB flats after purchasing private properties. However, exception is made for those who have obtained prior approval from HDB to sublet their flats under the Subletting of Flat policy.
 

The requisite occupation period for flat owners* who wish to sublet their HDB flats is shown below: 
 

3 years 

Non-subsidised flat (flat purchased from the open market without a CPF housing grant) and the application to buy the flat was received by HDB before 30 Aug 2010.
 

5 years 

Non-subsidised flat (flat purchased from the open market without a CPF housing grant) and the application to buy the flat was received by HDB on or after 30 Aug 2010. 

Subsidised flat (flat purchased directly from HDB or from the open market with a CPF housing grant)

Quote from CPF website 

I own a HDB flat (or private property) and intend to purchase a private property with my CPF after 1 July 2006. However, I intend to sell my existing HDB flat (or private property). Do I need to set aside half of the prevailing Minimum Sum before I can use my CPF?

During the grace period, you do not need to set aside half of the prevailing Minimum Sum before using your CPF Ordinary Account savings for the purchase of the second/subsequent property. The grace period is as follows:
