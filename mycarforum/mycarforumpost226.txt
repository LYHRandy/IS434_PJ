question on pte property buys..
 

currently have a HDB flat still paying CPF loan, and have stayed more than 5 yrs.
 

if i buy a pte condo now, but with no intention to sell off my HDB flat. 

Decided to pay the necessary downpayment with a combination of cash and CPF, and pay the remaining 60% via a bank loan.
 

Let's say 4 yrs down the road, i decided to sell my HDB flat, whereby the proceeds will go back to my CPF. 
 

At that point of time, will i be able to pay off my bank loan using the CPF proceeds?

And if there were to be any unpaid loan balance, i will then pay off with cash or take a new bank loan package? 
 

pls advise.

if you sell off your HDB and the proceeds go back to CPF, you will be able to "reuse" the monies once all interest and miscallaneous fees, duties hv been paid.
 

so the answer is yes

Yes you can as long as you have used cpf for the private property and it has a charge on the property if not you have to rerank the charge, and you can only use cpf for the 2nd property provided you have set aside half of the prevailing mimimum sum in your SA/OA

unlike hdb, private property is a legal open mortgage, hence housing loan portion, bank got first charge, cpf got 2nd charge, and any open line of credit after that ranks after these 2....if you never use cpf before and want to use cpf now you need a cpf lawyer to do the neceesary

Some food for thought.. will there be a negative domino effect or will China investors flee to buy more here instead? What do u think? Prices of Hong Kong properties have also started to fall and same goes for their rental market. Can we hold up with record number of condo launches and incoming supply of new flats and top?

Can refer to CPF website for info on whether your CPF funds are restrictd by Minimum http://ask-us.cpf.gov.sg/explorefaq.asp?category=23098
 

Technically as long as your CPF did not reach the limit, and the valuation of the new purchase remains the same as when you purchase or higher... YES is the answer to all your questions.

I prefer to have more cash in bank account at this current climate.. takerisk to sell see got opporunity if 2012 is worse than now.
 

However my potential buyers will not die as my asking price is very very reasonable.
 

Renting is good option as quite easy to rent but i ended all my tenancy lease last 2 months ago due to wanting to sell and easier for viewing. but if by mid Jan havent manage to sell at my asking price, will stop selling and rent out the entire place for next 4 years

Every development from Cheung Kung (Li Ka-Shing) company is priced at a premium.

Don't think Thomson Grand is targeting mass market crowd. A mid size development of 300 odd units with unblocked view and Private Lift.

HELLO EVERYONE I'M A NEWBIE SO I CANNOT START A TOPIC THEREFORE I'M USING THIS THREAD WHICH IS QUITECLOSE TO MY QUESTION
 

I'M A SINGAPOREAN MALE, AGE 34, SINGLE. I WILL FINALLY BE ABLE TO BUY A HDB FLAT SOON WHEN I REACH 35. I FIND IT STRANGE BECAUSE MY MALAYSIAN FRIEND IS ABLE TO BUY A HDB FLAT WITH HER SIBLING EVEN BEFORE SHE TURNED 35.
 

ANYWAY THE QUESTION IS... ONCE IM 35 WHAT OPTIONS DO I HAVE?
 

CAN I BUY A BTO FLAT OR AM I LIMITED TO RESALE FLATS ONLY?
 

IF I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE AND NEED TO GET RESALE FLAT I MIGHT CONSIDER GETTING EC INSTEAD.... CAN I GET AN EC WITH MY PARENTS NOW (LIKE THE TWIN WATERFALLS) OR AGAIN HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL 35.....
 

WAIT WAIT WAIT UNTIL WANT TO DIE ALREADY.... STILL NO ROOF OVER MY HEAD.... BUT STILL DOING RESERVIST DELIGENTLY... I FEEL QUITE STUPID

to the answer in red.... now PR siblings cannot buy flat liao....
 

you are limited to resale flats and if i am not wrong... only up to 3rm or 4rm....
 

you should be able to get a EC with your parents if they have no private property and will sell their existing flat.... but if ever you get married.. you may have a problem removing your name from the flat before being allowed to purchase 1 with you spouse

Now i'm finally going to be 35 but the resale flat prices are 3 times higher than when my ft frens bought it

I am in a similar situation as you, yes, hdb rules really suckz for singles, it's pro-marriage la, so the only solution for you is to get married fast fast and you can apply for a BTO, you can try vietnambrides.com for a start.....for me I work like s--t and saved up 400K so in the worst case scenario I will just buy a resale once I reach 35...

Hahahaha nobody's clone. I'm not really new here just that i don't post much. I've read a couple of threads and ofcourse the famous 400k. I guess it is nothing to be surprised about.



 

Damn I dont know I am so infamous, I apologize then for my baseless accusation...

I think it is because I am interested in threads which discusses about property and stuff. More often than not there will be some mention about your famous 400k. Actually i don't even know the full story of this 400k.

If that is true, that you are all right, buy a resale 450K property and loan 250K, you should be able to pay it off within 20 years easily

Yes I know. That is what most of my friends are doing. When i think of this option i will have 2 thoughts.
 

Thought 1: Might as well buy an EC for another 200k extra
 

Thought 2: "Vietnam bride" and get bto. Btw even if i get a vietnam bride i will have to wait until she gets pr? If she doesn't get pr i will be wasting my time?

Looks like the conclusion is straightforward. I knew it but I thought I might just might get some good advise from the good forumers here.
 

The bottomline is that even though i know that hdb resale flats are at unreasonable high prices I have no choice but to get them at almost the same price as fts.
 

There is no other options. Ppl in many threads have said that sporeans nowadays are crazy to splurge so much on properties but i wonder if they know that there are many like me who are not crazy but yet end up making this crazy decision of getting a pigeonhole at exorbitant prices

I am to shy to ask for help... don't want to end up wasting your time or anything like that
 

but i do have 1 question. If i do buy that condo what advantage do i have over an FT who is buying it? Are there any rebates or anything for sporean citizens? It may sound noob but i really have no idea on this one.

 Foreigner buy private property at 10% ABSD extra.  Rebates? Depends if you buy developer sale, if so, then may have discounts or stamp duty absorption (but you pay first) depending on their marketing .
 

If you buy a subsale condo, its all negotiation with the seller. I suggest buy one closer to its expected TOP.

Bro, condo prices are crazy now don't you think. I feel that anything other than BTO is not worth it at the moment(for a not well to do person like me). Even BTO prices are very high these days.
 

Btw my budget is around 300k. In worst case scenario i will get a small hdb flat. I don't really dare to invest in a condo now. 
 

I feel that EC like twin waterfalls is gd(and that is the most i am willing to fork out) but if they follow hdb ruling then i guess i'm not eligible for that either.

If you can afford, just go straight for condo and don't look back, if not, you will be held back for 5 years, goodness know what can happen in the 5 years?.  I started with condo in 2009 and another condo 2 years later and never regret.

well, if u were to buy a resale HDB flat, the amount of cash to pay up front for the COV would be better put to use for 5% cash downpayment for a private condo. in my opinion (same situation as u) no point buying resale at current prices, and if u don't get married, u can't qualify for BTO (which is quite ex in current terms too). hence i would wait out for the next dip, then go into private property. if u can't wait till then,then u can get a private condo like ripple bay at pasir ris 2bdrm 764sq feet for 650k thereabouts. its better than ur EC coz first, u don't qualify, 2nd the price is not that far off from the EC. With 50k cash savings and 150k CPF, u would be able to pay off the 650k condo. better than paying 450k plus COV for a 4rm resale HDB rite?

Finally a sensible post from you, it's more than 550 sq ft, but still too small with kids in the picture, as for the having property will make you attractive to ladies I say it depends on what type of ladies but yes generally ladies prefer a guy with car and property and maybe a child too

He earns less than 4k a month and is taking a loan of more than 450k, that is a tad aggressive. We are assuming he exhausts all his cash and CPF savings, leaving little room for the next downturn.  I won't recommend that unless he has some support from parent.

IMHO, I still think there is affordable 3rm HDB resale available to single, 35 yo, earning 4K a month.
 

The main issue is the expectation must be realistic. When I started, my wife and me just want to have a place to stay. Just need a roof over our heads. We joined the famous queuing system (Those where the days.... hahaha....). You plan at least 4 years ahead. By the time we were invitied to choose a flat, our queue number was almost the end of the entire exercise...   [:(]   . Imagine after waited 4 years & you are still at the end of the queue. So, what was available to us wasn't all the choice units. A few units in bukit panjang (sipei ulu). A few units in jurong west extension (sipei sipei ulu). And a few unit here and there in the west region. Yes, those were the days where you just state the region. North South East West. What to do?? We just make the best of the choice we were given.
 

And after we settled down (that's was in 1998), we work hard and we save hard. 2 kids came along the way. Crisis like 911, SAR, Lehman bros etc also came. No expensive holidays aboard nor expensive lifestyle in here. We save enough to own 2 private condos and have major interest in 2 commercial units now
 

Telling this little story of mine is not to brag about my achievement. In fact, what I have is nothing compared to many others in this forum. I am just wanting to encourage young people you got to start somewhere and work hard for it.

reason is simple
 

1) you got to wait a few years

2) you got to go balloting

3) old flats are 'bigger''
 

by the time you get BTO you be like what... 38? what are the chances that things might change... you might found a spouse, etc....

My objective is to just buy a simple and affordable house.
 

But if you guys observe the discussion always ends up with getting condo
 

I guess it is bcos public housing is so expensive that even condo seems to be a better choice these days
 

So much for affordable public housing

You also feel that it will be wise to start of with a 3 rm flat and work my way up.

based on pasir ris 4 rm resale prices... it is low 400k.... and 102 sqm.... which is about 1100ksqft... and 3 bedroom.. and the prices indicated in hdb is already inclusive of COV
 

compare this to a condo which is 30% smaller and 50% more expensive and has 1 less room..... and still have monthly conservancy fee... and presumaely also 99yr old lease
 

why is condo better?

3) old flats are 'bigger''
 

by the time you get BTO you be like what... 38? what are the chances that things might change... you might found a spouse, etc....
 

i got a funny feeling you just want to keep on harping on the BTO and FTs thingy rather than really need a flat



 

I plan to get balanced flats s that i do not have to wait. Furthermore like i said i am not fussy. But i'm not eligible.
 

Please do not get this funny feeling that i'm harping on bto and ft thing.
 
 
 
 

The scenario is simple:
 

A single singaporean wants to own an affordable flat like that of a bto therefore asking for advise in the forum.
 
 
 

Solution:
 

From the replies it seems that there is no such thing as an affordable option for a single even at 35. You can see that the answers often drifts away to overpriced resale flats or condos, the very ones ppl feel are completely overpriced
 
 
 

As one of the forummer has likened my scenario between choosing ecstacy and heroin. I asked back if there is a way out and there was no more reply.

based on pasir ris 4 rm resale prices... it is low 400k.... and 102 sqm.... which is about 1100ksqft... and 3 bedroom.. and the prices indicated in hdb is already inclusive of COV
 

compare this to a condo which is 30% smaller and 50% more expensive and has 1 less room..... and still have monthly conservancy fee... and presumaely also 99yr old lease
 

why is condo better?



 

These are the same questions I have in mind as well. 
 

Eventually i think i will most probably be getting a 3rm resale flat. 
 

I feel that it is the most sensible choice for me.
 

But every time I come to this conclusion I can't help but ask myself. What is the benefit of being a sporean and why can't singles buy bto flats. It just feels weird.

the point here is not about affordability but rather hdb's policy to discourage singles from buying flats. 
 

simply coz they wan u to marry and procreate. plain and simple. that's a whole different argument abt social engineering altogether.

I thought singles with partner can get bto after 21. Singles at 35 have already waited 14 years and they are allowed to get resale flats. Why not bto flats? Will this be seen as unfair by those with partners? If it is then i guess you are absolutely right. Absolutely nothing wrong with what you have said.

singles with partner can get at 21... but not everyone gets married at 21.... if some get married at 34 then why should you get it as a single 1 year later....
 

so it depends what is the age of the single with partner you are asking....

You have $150k in your CPF.

If you buy a $400k HDB flat, you need to loan $250k.

Pay over 25 years, monthly about $1k only. Your CPF OA should be just enough to pay the monthly.

Then you can rent out 2 rooms, easily $1200 CASH per month.

You, happy stay in your own flat. Happier days, stay in your parents home. Your choice.
 

You use your "dead" money in CPF to buy a flat and the rental income service your loan.

After 25 years, you get to keep the flat. And by then, the flat might have worth $800k.
 

What else do you want from Singapore?

sporeans are very nice. even when treated as 2nd class citizen they will tell you how fair the system is and ask you back what else you want from spore.
 

if you guys notice i'm not very choosy but i am very interested to go for one where sporeans will have a significant advantage e.g. bto, EC etc
 

anyway i think that i will not be enjoying any such advantage. thank you for all the advise.

personal preference, i'm single so hence i don't need such a large space. HDB u pay conservancy too,plus the 90bucks season parking. of course private u pay more, but i feel the difference between condo and hdb has close in in the recent years. if HDBs were going for 300-350k region for a 4-5rm flat, then there would be a substantial difference. my friend recently bought a new flat from HDB direct....610k for 5 rm flat 2nd floor. if u think HDB is affordable, think again

I bought one slightly less than 3yrs ago and have stated my case,  not cheap I agree but it is still affordable. 
 

of cuz alot people like to do their reno and 40k to 60k reno is now the norm rather than the abnormality...  so how can it not be affordable when people spend so much on reno....
 

and where is the 610k flat location?  
 

my friend just bidded for  a mansionette or EC from hdb at jurong...  if I rem correctly...  it is less than 500k.. should be mid to low 400
 

you want big,  you want good location... then 1 should not complain about the high prices 
 

there is a distinct difference between cheap and affordable

Age 

Unmarried Person or Divorcees

You must be at least 35 years old (based on date of birth) when submitting your resale flat application. 
 

Income Ceiling 

There is no income ceiling unless you are applying for CPF Housing Grant and/or an HDB Loan.
 

Ownership/Interest in Property in Singapore or Overseas other than HDB flats

You can own private property (unless you are applying for a CPF Housing Grant and/or an HDB loan).

However, you, your co-applicants and any occupiers listed in the resale application must dispose of any interest in any private residential property within 6 months from the completion of the purchase of the resale flat.

Ok this is what i found. If i forgo the pathetic housing grant i can own private property and still get a resale flat... this sounds great!

Btw why do you call this a loophole? It looks like a loophole only because the gov grant is pathetic.

Yup, I am a nice guy with useful advises but too much jealousy going around, it's kinda a loophole becos govt has plug private home owners from buying hdb but not the other way, hence you see all the mass market condos being bought by hdb home  owners.
 

Just go propertyguru search on search for property under hdb and I am sure you can find lotsa choices.

erm... the new ruling prevents both ways..... only those that fall under the new ruling can buy private even if they have HDB... but once they change HDB.. they will fall under new ruling
 
 

this is what i learned from HDB officers

i distinctly rem the hdb officers say.. if you buy hdb flat under old ruling.. you still can buy private but if you buy the flat after the new ruling in Aug... you cannot buy unless you sell
 

those that bought during new ruling have not reached the min. occupational period... so those buyers should be old ruling?

Meritocracy and my birth right qualifies me.

In any case, I pay my dues in terms of income tax for whatever "opportunity" the country has "given" me.

Maybe one day i will go bankrupt and then?

All singaporeans have a right to buy a new HDB, doesnt mean the one buying prevents another from not.

if so, then , its not base on meritocracy nor equality...
 

take note that it's not about asking for handouts or the likes, but to right to pay money to buy.

Well, I guess so, for myself I never expect the govt to do anything for me, just play within the framework, if I want changes then I join politics or join a lobbying group.....but perhaps count our blessings that we cannot buy....

yes everybody has a right to buy a new HDB
 

when the time presented to you in the past while you are increasing your own income

you did not take it
 

there was an oportunity for you then in the past
 

this is different from someone robbing you a HDB flat

HDB is not like pte.. got $$ can buy hor! .. you need to form a family nucleu then can apply. 

Also not everyone salary grow as slowly as you hor.. Some didnt even get to buy just after 1-2 yrs working.
 

Lower income pay peanuts or no tax hor...and they buy big HDB hor. and sell for big $$ hor.

lets me frank

what is your aim of getting a HDB

is it to make money because you think it is a cash cow
 

dont be red eye just because people can make money 

you are wealthy enough because you know how to make money from somewhere else

one have to ask 

what HDB was built for
 

if he already exceeded the income cap then he already is ahead of thousands of people
 
 

if he really wants to get a hDB flat in the past or even how

he can 

the problem is 

is he willing to do all that it takes to meet the criteria
 

HDB did not ban him from application

but it is him, himself who disqualifies himself 
 
 
 

it is like 

crying and throwing tantrum 

that why one is not allowed to join the private banking

Thats the problem, in case you still dont underdtand my point.

It should be a birth right.
 

Secondly, you were the one who brought up the "opportunities" that the country has "given" me.

Which translates to a discussion on income tax.

I already said it should not be about taxes nor opportunities, it should be a blo0dy birth right which it isnt now. And thats the freaking problem.
 

Secondly i never had the opportunity to buy it becos i wasnt going to get married at the point in time my income qualified. And when i was gonna get married my income didnt qualify.
 

And lastly i certainly can whine as much as the next man.

I understand your frustration.
 

It is not about whether we are able to live with it or not. It is about how our system puts some singaporean citizens at a disadvantage even though they have contributed equally or even more(e.g. ns) to the country.
 

For your case it is due to finacial status
 

For me it is my marital status
 

The only difference is that since you are financially gd it does not affect you as much as someone who is financially struggling like me. none the less the system has put us at a disadvantage even if we feel that it is a birth right. Guess there is no such thing as birth rights in this unique "home" my friend. Which is why our loyalty is going down the drain and ns men are wondering what the hell they are doing.

Yes exactly that.
 

And since I got it financially slightly better, i become "un-entitled" ...WTF?
 

"opportunites" that the country has "given" me are not much different from the ones that are given to the next man in the street.   Isnt it meritocracy that makes the difference?  
 

Therefore my point is as simple as ABC.  BIRTH RIGHT.  

Dont mixed it up with the other things which are already covered by meritocracy.

you must first come to grips that why:

there are some people who dont pay tax whiles others do

yet those pay taxes, some pay excessively more than other, yet they get nothing back from the country
 

ask yourself WHAT IS the purpose of HDB FLATS in this country?
 

why is HDB flats singled out as a birth right?

is NS a birth right of every singaporeans

our malays have rightfully their birth rights
 
 

taking to an extreme of birth rights

isnt it our birth right to have a clean and smokeless environment (btw I smoke)
 
 

i believe if income tax or opportunity is not your issue

than you have to ask yourself what is birth right
 

in singapore, there is NO such thing as birth right

in malaysia, the bumis have birth right
 

your argument despite your denial

is based on monetary gain that you missed
 
 

if HDB flats results in everybody being negative in asset

would you still be kpkb about your birth rights

I agree, but don't give a f anymore as I grow older, unless they let me buy bto regardless of age, marital status and how many properties I own

Same here. I no longer worry about birth rights. I'm more worried about birth disadvantages in this country. If not disadvantaged I am happy like bird already.

you must first come to grips that why:

there are some people who dont pay tax whiles others do

yet those pay taxes, some pay excessively more than other, yet they get nothing back from the country
 

ask yourself WHAT IS the purpose of HDB FLATS in this country?
 

why is HDB flats singled out as a birth right?

is NS a birth right of every singaporeans

our malays have rightfully their birth rights
 
 

taking to an extreme of birth rights

isnt it our birth right to have a clean and smokeless environment (btw I smoke)
 
 

i believe if income tax or opportunity is not your issue

than you have to ask yourself what is birth right
 

in singapore, there is NO such thing as birth right

in malaysia, the bumis have birth right
 

your argument despite your denial

is based on monetary gain that you missed
 
 

if HDB flats results in everybody being negative in asset

would you still be kpkb about your birth rights



 

birth right is birth right.

got nothing to do with monetary gain.
 

whether make money or not, my stand is that as a singaporean, i must have the right to buy a new hdb from govt.

whether i buy or not, now that is a totally different debate
 

after so freaking long you still cant understand? looks like your skull is too thick. over and out, dude.

But unfortunately I don't own a house.



 
 

again dont get me wrong, there is no real pain in terms of financials.

i think you are too full of yourself 

to think that HDB is a birth right
 

my stand is HDB is NOT a birth right

but it is yours if you can fulfill their criteria
 

ask around and see any sane people will agree with you

on the contrary, every sane Singaporean will agree with me.

Hdb representing affordable accomodation should be birth right to every singaporean.
 

otherwise , might as well make parents who earn more than $10k per month pay triple the school fees compared to parents who earn below $10k for their kids education in the same govt school
 

or better still totally disallow people who earn above $12k from staying in C class ward.
 

all this things are BIrTH RIGhTS.  accomodation, education and health.  every singaporean must be accorded the same.  whether they take it or not is a different debate.
 

by the way i think you are gonna be banned.....

lets just still to HDB 
 

the premise of HDB being built was to ensure Singaporeans will always have an affordable roof over their head
 

having a roof over your head and calling your own is not a birth right
 

having a roof over your head is your birth right
 

as to what kind of roof (HDB, institutional or etc) depends on your finance ability
 

you are confusing two issues
 

that is 
 

basic human needs (or requirements) are not just your birth rights or human rights such as clean water, healthcare and etc
 

birth rights is not a given but largely depends on the policy maker of the land to designated what is your birth rights
 

did you know
 

Thai muslims recently have been given bumi status (birth right) in Malaysia when they become citizen

this will illustrate the point
 
 

if you are so sure HDB is your birth right

why dont you go to HDB and demand your birth right
 

dont be a sore loser 

just because many HDB owners having been milking the system

Beg to differ. 
 

First, the phrase 'birth right' is not the proper terminology. A 'birth right' is a right entitled by birth,and hence available only to born citizens. For example, the right to vote is a birth right because it is not available to non citizens. What you are advocating is more properly term 'equal right. This is because hdb housing is available to non citizens, and your point is that the rules created by hdb in making an application for a flat should be removed.
 

But equal rights cannot apply to all citizens where some rights are necessarily protected. Hdb housing is government housing and is intended to cater to a disadvantaged group in society. The business of the government is not to provide universal housing but housing to disadvantaged groups. The govt identifies this group indirectly through its various application criteria for hdb.

Therefore, if you are not part of the disadvantaged group, you are not entitled to govt assistance in providing a roof over your head. It follows that rights must be differentiated.
 

 Can you claim that you are entitled to be taught in a special needs school when such a school is intended for a certain group of people? The answer is no.
 
 

So, as a rational singaporean, and one priced out of hdb housing, humbly disagree with you.

i do see your point on the terminology used.

and i think you also understand what i mean.

again, i am not talking about what is the current rules and regulations.

i am saying it should be a birth right. simple as that.
 

your special needs school example totally doesnt cut it lah, dude.

thats is special needs.  HDB is by no means special needs.

My example of govt school is a much more correct analogy.
 

and honestly you are priced out becos?

perhaps you ponder again, there much more behind that which i dont even want to go into.
 

thanks for a mild mannered reply. i appreciate that.

Civilised people distinguish themselves through civilised debate; ie the ability to present contrary views without the need to debase to a personal level. 
 

I am not eligible by virtue of income, even if i dispose all my private properties.
 

The point on special school is to surface a point, which I think was surfaced. Your government school analogy cannot hold water because education is a fundamental human right. Housing however is not. Thats the key difference.
 

I have been following this debate avidly and would arrive at the same conclusion I have pondered again.
 

I think its best that the term 'birth right' be avoided as that leads to some confusion as well.

A fundamental human right is one where government actively protects.  Housing however is not such a right because it is not the function of government to protect that specific need of everyone. In turn the reason for the latter is that there is a fair bit of people do not need government

ok , plse tell me you are not another lightbringer type.  aka the academic, theory means everything, nitpick on grammar and typo kind.

and please kindly speak simply, i am not very educated.

and please please dont go explaining definitions and debating on technicalities, you sounding more and more like my creepy legal counsel.
 

i admit, i fused birth right with citizen right. my bad for the second time.
 

I state my case simply.

I am singaporean, dont tell me that my income is above $xxxxx, i am not allowed to buy a HDB.

becos then the next thing is that you may tell me that my income is above $xxxxxx, i cannot send my kids to government school.

Or my income is above $xxx , i cannot go to polyclinic.
 

then, I would also say, my income is above $xxxxxx, my kids dont need to do NS...
 

whether i actually do buy a HDB or send my kids to government school or choose to go polyclinic is another thing altogether but dont tell me i cannot.

That is just plain b-------t and not fair.  such things should not be based on income.

whether one is rich or poor, one does NS. why, becos of our citizenship. we are singaporeans.

whether one is rich or poor, one must be allowed to buy HDB direct from govt becos we are citizens, we are singaporeans

that is my point.
 

note: i am all for HDBs not being bought and used as a tool for making money by people of a higher income level.  

so rules need to be implemented upon purchase.  thats perfectly understandable.

however, it cannot simply be due to income above $xxxx, cannot buy.  thats KNN.....

On a serious note, what you said resonates perfectly with what I feel, doesn't mean I rich(which I am not) I cannot go hawker centre, doesn't mean I rich, I cannot go polyclinic and queue one long day, doesn't mean I rich I cannot buy my first HDB. I contribute more in terms of stamp duty taxes and income tax and I get nothing from them, apart from perhaps a relatively crimefree country.

I state my case simply.

I am singaporean, dont tell me that my income is above $xxxxx, i am not allowed to buy a HDB.

becos then the next thing is that you may tell me that my income is above $xxxxxx, i cannot send my kids to government school.

Or my income is above $xxx , i cannot go to polyclinic.
 

then, I would also say, my income is above $xxxxxx, my kids dont need to do NS...




good one

whether one is rich or poor, one does NS. why, becos of our citizenship. we are singaporeans.

whether one is rich or poor, one must be allowed to buy HDB direct from govt becos we are citizens, we are singaporeans

that is my point.
 

note: i am all for HDBs not being bought and used as a tool for making money by people of a higher income level.  

so rules need to be implemented upon purchase.  thats perfectly understandable.

however, it cannot simply be due to income above $xxxx, cannot buy.  thats KNN.....




precisely, all we need is a simple rule, hdb owner is not allowed to have private property in SG + increase MOP to 10 years for combined income > 12K.

Its about providing varying levels of subsidies to the different income groups. Simply, HDB is subsidised housing for the 80%. As for the top 20%, I think the higher powers believe this group does not require the assistance, and have thus chosen to exclude them from this subsidised public housing scheme. Lets put it this way, would you feel happier if they allowed you to buy HDB, but at double the price of those who qualify? Perhaps you might, but its as good as not having it.  
 

I take it as a punishment for not starting a family straight out of school, when the income was at 0. 
 

BTW, table wipers who earn 3.8k still qualify. A pair of table wipers, would only make 7.6k....

Yes, i can accept your explanation.
 

however i am a person with lots of feelings....somehow today, i dont feel that HDB is very "subsidised"

and talking about assistance, many many many people living in HDB today dont need the "assistance" either.

40 years ago and today is different.  
 

Again even if it is subsidized and to "assist", every Singapore should be entitled to pick their form of housing.

eg.  If I choose to be frugal although I earn above the income ceiling, i should be accorded my right as a singapore to buy brand new HDB.  Of course other rules must be in place so that this "right" is not taken advantaged of.
 

anyway, if you read more carefully, it isnt about me.  

I am talking about the sad folks who got sandwiched.

table wiper like me with mountain of debt and creditors at my back, cant afford a new HDB, can only rent.

maybe next week, I get kicked out by rich HDB landlord who owns BMW and private properties..

HDB is supposed to be subsidised housing. So now, many already kpkb canno afford.

If your argument of "birth rights" win, what do you think the HDB price will be?

Good post. My exact feelings about this. 

In fact HDB flat should be price controlled by govt. 

To buy private, must give up HDB flat.

Obviously, you cannot make money from it. 

You will only get back your purchase price, period, may plus the intrest you paid. 
 

The idea is, i pay my dues(income taxes, NS etc) , i get my entitlements(to vote and/or DBS flat) 
 
 

But if you choose not to buy private, no matter what income you are, you are entitled to buy a HDB flat.

Whether my "argument" wins or not, the price of new HDB is meant to be determined / controlled by the Govt.
 

In fact if my "argument" wins, then they know, they MUST provide for Singaporeans and they will have to keep more land to build more HDBs.   
 

Note that my discussion is only about brand new HDB, got nothing to do with secondary market.

I used to think this was the best solution, but i realised a perhaps fatal flaw. 
 

Imagine a HDB dweller who sinks half a million into his HDB, and the another sinks a million into his cheap condo. 10 years later, both have done reasonably well, Singapore has done exceptionally well, and prices have now doubled. The HDB dweller's money has not been put to the right use, and he's unable to profit from Singapore's success. Is it right to punish the HDB dweller? Should he suffer unduly because of his prudent choice? Would that not turn into a vicious cycle of some sort, where the rich get richer? 
 

These are tough questions, that I couldnt answer, and I hope the higher powers have considered. 
 

All said, a lot more can be done to help the sandwich class, Im just not sure how.

Good one, but i feel it is not 'punish' as you make it out to be. 

You are only considering 1 scenario. Up. However, there is always another side to the coin. 

If prices tank(for whatever reason), like in Vegas a few years back, by 30-50%, can we say we are punishing the rich?
 

The property investment/dwelling is subjected to the vagaries of the market. 

If they make money, good. Lose money too bad.

No money?  Don't risk it in the market, then complain after that. 

In fact, one can see it as a protection of the lower income to be insulated from market movements.

Punish is the wrong word here, dude

We all make choices in life.

The key is that WE are making our choices not someone else.
 

Yes, if you are overly prudent you cannot make as much money in a rosy situation (that is very very fair)

Likewise, if you are not prudent when the world comes crashing down , you must pay the price.

As they say, high risk high returns .  
 

As mentioned last time I can buy detached house, i didnt buy.

Today I suck thumb.  do I blame anyone for being prudent?  No.

I enjoyed the stability and ability to tell my family, "no worries" even during the darkest hours of the economic crisis.
 

I have to say, your argument this time is totally 100% flawed.
 

Similarly, the argument that Ministers cannot be paid like a private sector CEO.

Becos anything wrong, CEO head rolls, not a minister.  

Nobody is punished here, my friend.

Funny, how you just plucked the words right out of my mouth Teddy....
 

Amazing.  
 

Glad someone here understands and shares what I've been saying becos so many dont.

It seems like many here are just arguing on the basis of the price of HDB going up if every singaporean were to be allowed to buy a new one albeit with certain restrictions.

I absolutely agree with most of your posts with regard to risk/reward. Oh and I apologise for using "punish", my english is not so good.  
 

I raised the scenario purely in response to Ted's original comments on not allowing HDB dwellers to profit. 
 

For me when 80% of the population are HDB dwellers, then it cannot be that only 20% who can afford and choose to not buy HDB are the beneficiaries.  We can argue that its about choice, but what about those who NEVER had the choice. That they were, at the material point in time, unable to afford HDB? 
 

There are flaws to every policy. I just do not think Ted's solution is the one. 
 

I think we could do away with this whole pretense of HDB homes as home "ownership". We could allow citizens to rent directly from the HDB at low , low prices, for periods shorter than the 99 years. In that way, the owner is not tied to some 30 year loan, and has to pay interest and yet be unable to profit in good times. All this is already happening with the very low income groups. Should we extend it to the rest of the HDB dwellers? 
 

In short, there are no easy ways to not allow profiteering of HDB flats, particularly if they build for 80% of the people. We have to stop thinking of HDB as subsidised public housing.

I absolutely agree with most of your posts with regard to risk/reward. Oh and I apologise for using "punish", my english is not so good.  
 

I raised the scenario purely in response to Ted's original comments on not allowing HDB dwellers to profit. 
 

For me when 80% of the population are HDB dwellers, then it cannot be that only 20% who can afford and choose to not buy HDB are the beneficiaries.  We can argue that its about choice, but what about those who NEVER had the choice. That they were, at the material point in time, unable to afford HDB? 
 

There are flaws to every policy. I just do not think Ted's solution is the one. 
 

I think we could do away with this whole pretense of HDB homes as home "ownership". We could allow citizens to rent directly from the HDB at low , low prices, for periods shorter than the 99 years. In that way, the owner is not tied to some 30 year loan, and has to pay interest and yet be unable to profit in good times. All this is already happening with the very low income groups. Should we extend it to the rest of the HDB dwellers? 
 

In short, there are no easy ways to not allow profiteering of HDB flats, particularly if they build for 80% of the people. We have to stop thinking of HDB as subsidised public housing.



 
 

ah, i see. understand now. clearer now.
