most typical case is sky habitat.....when they launched with 1700psf, many people laughed at the pricing.
 

but fast forward one year later, 1700psf is no longer the top selling price.

Need to go until so far as loyang? Geylang/Paya Lebar got $1000psf liao.. the leasehold and freehold ranges from 1k-1.3k psf.. 
 

I just bought one for 900+psf 1500sqft unit in Jan before latest cooling measure..
 

Singapore got too mnay rich people buy properties at loyang for 1000+psf liao.. or maybe they love changi beach very much.

you probably can't sense the sarcasm in my writing.
 

a lot of people always say freehold more valuable, more in demand.  give me a FH in loyang and a LH99 at Lavendar at same price, i will take the one at lavendar anytime.

FH is definitely better value.
 

My fren brought his Bayshore from 1st owner long ago....Bayshore sld be less than 80yrs left in lifespan...my fren wondering if he keeps it for another 10-15yrs, it may not be profitable to sell. 
 

Once ur 99y LH condo reaching 1/3 of the lifespan...u cant sell much for profit liao and will be caught in dilemma like him...KEEP for rental or Sell before its loses value.
 
 

U can still get FH at city fringe such as Geylang...but traditional ppl will still bother by it being red light district. cheaper n even near to city than AMK or bishan.

FH merely gives one less to scrutinise when property reaches 30+ years old.  and that is hardly a consolation considering the extra cash paid upfront and the fact one had been holding it for 30 years already.

wrong.....during year 2001 - 2006, property prices were basically flat or declining.  so not all properties are good all the time.
 

i would say any property in a good location in the hands of astute buyer is good.  he knows when is right time to sell, when is right time to hold.

I am also not trying to imply that FH will be definitely more superior to LH. Just merely stating that at 2k psf, I would choose to invest in a FH property. 

It's naive to use loyang as a FH example to compare with a LH at lavender.

generally, its best to diversify and have one FH, and one LH. Just make sure the LH location must be solid cos as time passes, the value of the LH can only be depended on its good location. 
 

FH? since forever who knows one fine day, Loyang become hotspot? SG is small anyway so might as well buy in Loyang than Iskandar right? As investment, I would avoid poorly located LH condos, too far from MRT, no amenities. Buy to stay then different story, but who doesn't want their home stay property to grow? So choose wisely.
 

If can afford, best one FH, LH and one commercial, er maybe one in Msia, London and the list goes on!

Haha.. didn't know u r saying 反话.
 

I agree with u.. its always location location location.
 

 In 2004, a FH floral drive problably cost 300+-400psf.. now its 800+-1100psf. While a leasehold at lavender cost probably 400-600psf in 2004, but now its 1500-1800psf. Both appreciates but magnitude are so different even one if FH and another leasehold.
 

So agree with u.

I went see their new launched condo then. 
 

If folks had bought first hand it would cost 700+psf. Subsequently such an owner if tried to offload it would only be able to see 500psf.  He would have lost about 250psf .even if he had held it till 2007, he would still have been in the red. It was only somewhere in late 2009 that they would have profited.  While most other lh condo would have profited from selling in 2008 because they didn't pay more upfront for the supposedly more valuable fh.

If both are within same location, isn't it obvious which one will hold better value in the long term? 

This is not rocket science, no logic just talking only location without consideration on the price difference.

value added is a misnomer actually.
 

no property can itself add value to itself.  more like it is the demand and supply and change of government policies that makes a property more or less valuable.  if we assume no change in government policies, then location is the chief determinant of demand. age is probably the second determinant.  yes there are demand for FH i agree but that is not the same as saying FH status is value adding.  but do bear in mind where age of property is concerned, it does not have a straight line effect on value.  and also a new LH99 property is in fact more in demand than an aged FH property.
 

location as the chief determinant of demand will hold even for future but however, location cannot overcome effects of government policies changes, that is for sure.

erm... the comparsion i find abit off... but nvm we can agree to disagree...
 

yes location is important.... which is also 1 of the main determinant as you mentioned but you are using a new LH99 and aged FH. it should be newly renovated FH to be fair.

yeah but my earleir point to another forumer is, LH99 doesn't drop value much faster than FH in the first 30 years.  but after the first 30 years, this FH would also be losing value in comparison to new FH and LH99.  so the advantage of FH is not distinct, at least from past till now.

"There was $519 billion in cash sitting in Singapore banks as at end-December last year. This rose to $528 billion at the end of January 2013. "If you stack that amount in $100 bills, the height will be two-and-a-half times that of the Singapore Flyer," he said.

All this cash is earning next to nothing in the banks. "This is the dilemma facing many investors - their investments are at a standstill but their investment goals remain the same," noted Mr Tan at a media conference this week entitled "Time to take stock".

According to data compiled by Morningstar, investors have been taking funds out of Asian equity mutual funds in each of the past five years. In total, some US$113 billion (S$141 billion) has been withdrawn from the funds."

If developers are getting the land thru govt land sales at close to S$1000psf, not way that they are going to sell below S$1500psf. And we are only talking about breakeven and not even earning a decent profit for the risk they take to build houses. 
 

So, who is the main cause of home prices sky rocketing? Although there is another school of thoughts that says that even if the developer is getting the land cheap, they may not sell cheap as well. For this I said, let the market judge the developer. The least we can is to minimise the opportunity for the developer to jack up the housing price.

If developers are getting the land thru govt land sales at close to S$1000psf, not way that they are going to sell below S$1500psf. And we are only talking about breakeven and not even earning a decent profit for the risk they take to build houses. 
 

So, who is the main cause of home prices sky rocketing? Although there is another school of thoughts that says that even if the developer is getting the land cheap, they may not sell cheap as well. For this I said, let the market judge the developer. The least we can is to minimise the opportunity for the developer to jack up the housing price.




developers are profited oriented entities run by rational folks.  if every condo is sellable at such high pricing, why would they adopt a cost plus type of pricing approach rather than market pricing driven approach.
 

a good example is the piece of land in jalan lempeng, off clementi avenue 6.  it was bidded at considerably lower price because the GLS took place earlier.  but still the prices during launch have been marked to market .

problem is share prices of developers doesn't directly correlate to their profitability.

value added is a misnomer actually.
 

no property can itself add value to itself.  more like it is the demand and supply and change of government policies that makes a property more or less valuable.  if we assume no change in government policies, then location is the chief determinant of demand. age is probably the second determinant.  yes there are demand for FH i agree but that is not the same as saying FH status is value adding.  but do bear in mind where age of property is concerned, it does not have a straight line effect on value.  and also a new LH99 property is in fact more in demand than an aged FH property.
 

location as the chief determinant of demand will hold even for future but however, location cannot overcome effects of government policies changes, that is for sure.



 
 
 

As 99LH gets to their end of lease, and no enbloc, the owners will then have to prepare to tear down their building to return the original land to government, correct?

yep of course......you need not look further.....actually I saw some advertisement of leasehold landed that is selling very cheap mainly because of their short lease left.  
 

it is not that I don't believe leasehold 99 can't depreciate.  more like I am saying the depreciaton is definitely not straight line and there's no need to pay a premium for FH over a relatively new LH99 nor settle for a poorer location FH .
