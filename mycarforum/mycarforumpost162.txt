If they advertise in SG papers, then ty aim Sillyporeans n the prices sure  
 

We go Johor n look at those that the Msians r looking at. Better valus for money lah.

Homes away from home
 

27 March 2011

Straits Times

Home to educator Denyse Tessensohn had always been Singapore. But two years ago, after agonising over it, her family uprooted from their five-room Zion Road flat to settle in Johor, Malaysia, instead. 
 

Her younger son, Mikhil, 25, an aspiring music therapist, had a place to study at the Berklee College of Music in Boston.
 

But when they worked out the sums, the family found that they could not afford Mikhil's overseas education if they continued to live in Singapore. 
 

Two years on, they have since found the move not as painful as they had expected.
 

Ms Tessensohn, 60, and her husband Steve Hogan, 62, refer to their 9,000 sq ft home as a 'modest bungalow'.
 

Spacious as it is compared to their former HDB flat, it is the second smallest home in the Ledang Heights estate in Nusajaya, west of Johor Baru city.
 

For the $400,000 price tag, they have four bedrooms, a garden, parking space and membership in the estate's clubhouse which has a pool, gym and restaurant.
 

'Our living cost is much lower; utilities are a quarter of what we used to pay,' Ms Tessensohn said. 'It's quiet, there's space, good air. It's affordable and there's very good food.'
 

The couple commute to work in Singapore five days a week. Mr Hogan is an artist and teacher.
 

Moving to Johor
 

More Singaporean families have gone to live in and commute from Johor. They are attracted to its up-and-coming residential cities such as Nusajaya, where big houses and a quality lifestyle can be had on middle-class incomes.
 

Take the figures at East Ledang and Horizon Hills, two estates in Nusajaya where expatriates make up half of the residents. Of the foreigners, 80 per cent are Singaporean.
 

Not all is rosy though. Most of the foreigners - including the Singaporeans - interviewed by The Sunday Times, admitted that their homes had been broken into at least once. 
 

Most of the Singaporeans declined to be photographed, concerned that they might be discriminated against by their fellow countrymen for - in the words of one - 'semi-quitting' their homeland. 
 

Nusajaya
 

From the sky, Nusajaya resembles a city in progress. Patches of construction areas and swathes of virgin greenery make up the bulk of the 9,308ha landscape.
 

There is access to the highways bound for Johor Baru city or the Tuas checkpoint, both 20 minutes' ride away. Nusajaya is said to be on the way to becoming one of the most sought-after residential cities in Johor. 
 

It is part of the Iskandar Malaysia project to develop Johor into an economic powerhouse. The area, including regions such as Johor Baru city, Senai and Pontian, is three times the size of Singapore. 
 

In Nusajaya itself, various hubs are in the pipeline. There is EduCity, a 242ha collection of brand-name colleges and research centres, including Britain's Newcastle University and Singapore's MDIS. Newcastle's medical college will be ready there by this year.
 

Its integrated theme park, Legoland Malaysia, is due to be completed by next year. A transport hub has also been planned for the area, with a coastal highway due to be ready by next year.
 

Residential enclaves - like Ms Tessensohn's estate - have already sprung up. Each estate touts itself grander than the next. Nusajaya's Horizon Hills, for example, features an 18-hole award-winning golf course at residents' doorsteps. 
 

Despite the premium pricing for houses in Nusajaya - starting from RM700,000 (S$292,000) for terrace units with about 5,000 sq ft in built-up space - they are popular with Singaporeans, who make up half the clientele.
 

Technology consultant Wu Qi (not his real name), is one of them. His semi-detached house cost him less than RM800,000 when he bought it two years ago. It takes him about an hour to travel to his office in Singapore's Central Business District each workday.
 

But the 34-year-old said: 'It is worth it. I enjoy the fresh air, the space and the freedom. It's not really about the travelling cost but whether it makes long-term sense.'
 

The lower cost of living was also a draw for Mr Steven Wong, 40, who has a weekend home in Setia Indah. The manufacturing firm manager estimates that food items in Malaysia are two to three times cheaper, thanks to the currency conversion.
 

'Living here is so much cheaper,' he said. 'The money saved can go towards my retirement. If I still live in Singapore, I won't be able to retire in comfort.'
 

Security issues
 

The expanses of land in both developed residential projects and uncompleted ones can lead to security issues, though. 
 

At East Ledang, tall 'anti-climb' fences enclose entire residential developments, while guards patrol 24/7 within and closed-circuit television cameras scan the perimeters for intruders.
 

Meanwhile, the Johor police has been combating the perception that crime is a serious issue in the area. 
 

Last year, the authorities arrested 3,286 suspects for break-ins that include property and vehicle thefts. 
 

Local media said the crime rate dipped by 22 per cent after the authorities stepped up patrols and crime prevention campaigns. The Malaysian government has also allocated RM140 million to build a district police headquarters for Nusajaya.
 

Still, many residents take no chances when it comes to personal safety. 
 

Ms Tessensohn said her house was broken into three times in two years after she moved in.
 

'We now have razor wire, grilles and dogs. Alarms are about to be installed,' she said. 'The guards had been slack. Now a RM5 million safety fence has been installed. We feel a lot safer.'
 

Mr Wu, too, said residents look for ways to cope. 
 

'Crime is everywhere, be it in Johor Baru or Singapore. The key is to have some common sense and not be flashy. Keep a low profile. Never display your wealth,' he said.
 

Fitting in
 

Australian writer Kaz Augustin, 45, spent two years in Singapore before she moved to Johor Baru with her husband and two children in 2008.
 

Recreation for the family includes visiting the Ledang Heights estate's clubhouse and restaurants. They also take walks in the park in the estate, or enjoy the nearby lake in their motorised speedboat.
 

Bukit Indah, which is about 10 minutes away by car for the Augustins, has supermarket chains such as Jusco and Tesco, and shops. But there are some things in Singapore that are hard to beat. 
 

'I miss the libraries there. There is no library close to us to take the children to,' said Mrs Augustin.
 

Residents there are awaiting the completion of Legoland and Puteri Harbour, a waterfront development. Till then, they spend their free time around the usual places in their gated communities, and however far their cars can take them out of Nusajaya.
 

Life in Johor can be slower in other ways, too. Ms Tessensohn said the Internet connection at her home is 'laggy', as are many services there.
 

'It can take a huge amount of time to get something done,' she said. 
 

Mr Wong spends more time waiting for the waiters in restaurants to serve him than he does in Singapore, but he has learnt to take things easy. 'You must remember you're not in Singapore,' he said. 
 

But he does see some pluses in the faster pace in Singapore.
 

'Rushing for time may not be such a bad thing, at least when it comes to work. It means we get our work done faster so we have more time for other things,' he said.
 
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 

Peace of mind - at a price 
 

'We now have razor wire, grilles and dogs. Alarms are about to be installed...The guards had been slack. Now they are on the ball and a RM5 million safety fence has been installed. We feel a lot safer.'
 

SINGAPOREAN DENYSE TESSENSOHN, whose Ledang Heights home in Nusajaya has been burgled three times in the two years since she moved in 
 

Keeping a low profile 
 

'Crime is everywhere, be it in Johor Baru or Singapore...The key is to have some common sense and not be flashy. Keep a low profile. Never display your wealth.'
 

SINGAPOREAN TECHNOLOGY CONSULTANT WU QI, who owns a semi-detached house in Nusajaya

Hello bro. RM500K is only abt S$200K. Or buy apartment also can. Buy in another name by proxy but hv all the transfer papers signed into yr name just in case. Lawyers can help. Or find a young mei mei n marry her in Johor n register house under her.

I prefer east ledang as it's MUCH closer to tuas checkpoint than HH. Also, I personally find East Ledang houses much nicer than HH. If you stay at Nusajaya area u get a pass of sort which frees you from filling up the white card from then on. Also, Medini is in the works, and around EL.
 

I do like the golf course at HH though. Can spend a whole lazy afternoon sitting at the club house overlooking the course with a nice book.
 

Am buying a unit or two at EL soon. Either two semi-D or a bungalow with a pool (I need a pool. Swims everyday).
 

Do note their housing loan rates are very high (ard 4%+), but u can open a FD to offset the interest rates; for those of u who are taking a housing loan.

bungalow about 6 bedrooms, with a half-lap pool. HUGE living room, dry kitchen etc. Even the foyer parks 2-3 cars. about 1mil SGD with interior design.
 

semi-D about 4-500k SGD about 4 rooms IIRC. but no pool. 
 

the entire estate has playground, landscaping etc. quite worth it except for the high interest.
 

resale only available after 5yrs. why buy resale when u can buy brand new?

One more comparison.
 

HH is at Bukit Indah; Jusco/Tesco are all within 5mins drive. Along the way is also a stretch of shophouses with eatery.
 

EL's surroundings are developing; could take a few years. But a coastal highway is in the works and can link to JB/woodlands with a travel time of 30mins or less. Medini (their new CBD) is in that area. And I'd say it here once more; the houses in EL are much nicer than HH, IMHO.

Hi, Bro,

There is one very good Muar Otah Stall at Taman Johor, Off Jalan Skudai, opposite side of KIP Mart, this stall is side by side with a famous Stir Fried Restaurant:"Kuang Hui Seafood".

The dinning food is yummy and the price is cheap, I've to remind my sg-wife not to calculate the currency rate and show her happy face upon paying.

If anyone needs details of the exact location may PM me.............

Setia has many homes there. I think those in yesterdays papers r too damm ex. We go look for those with better value for money.
 

If they advertise in SG papers, then ty aim Sillyporeans n the prices sure  
 

We go Johor n look at those that the Msians r looking at. Better valus for money lah.

btw, I'm not a real estate agent, just a normal salaryman.
 

Happen to take the pictures with a newly purchased camera (EOS 550). Am no professional or hobby photographer as well; I'm sure u can see.
 

But one thing I might add; the KFC at Jusco tastes so much better than ours here. Was told we use frozen chicken hence it's not as juicy. But of course, you wait like, 30mins to place your order (why they don't open up another queue is beyond my comprehension), and 15mins for it to arrive, and the waiter can still miss your table despite u telling him it's your order he's walking around with.
 

Parking at Jusco I rem is what, RM2?or RM1?
 

Also bought quite a lot of homewear for kids. Cheap anyway. 
 

I don't go pretty much anywhere else. Usually just go to EL, HH, and end the day with KFC lunch at Jusco and light shopping.

There is more than 1 way to skin a cat.

dun forget u still need to pay 11000 rm for the levy to the malaysian government before you can sign the s n p agreement.(mandatory). The malaysia land dept. will then decide whether to grant u the right to buy the house.

plus u need to pay cash of 20 per cent of the total selling price of the house. Min house price that you can buy (foreigner) is rm 500 000. 

Some places you cannot buy becoz they are classified as Tanah Rizab Melayu e.g Tmn Nongchik Heights ( the 1st honeycomb project in JB , around Danga Bay area).

stamp duty/legal fee are usually absorbed by developer.

20% cash downpayment..... is that not the same as what you have to pay for private housing here? At least I do. And it's 40% cash for 2nd property (with outstanding loan) now. 
 

RM 500k is what, SGD 220k? You probably can't even get a HDB here. Sorry, I've no clue on HDB prices as I've never bought one before. 200k for a landed property, as a weekend getaway or potential retirement home. I don't see why not. 
 

RM 11k is what, SGD 5k? And stamp duty is absorbed? Even for a 600k studio here you pay over 10k for stamp duty already. (To be fair, you can use CPF to pay though.)
 
 

Pls don't get me wrong -- I'm not coercing people to buy JB houses; only juxtaposing facts.
 

But if you really are keen, I'd suggest you pay with full cash. The housing loan rates are seriously unattractive; and I have not even started on appreciation and rental yields.

Yap, hence can't really retire fully yet. Kids are still young and I believe having education in SG is still better than enrolling them in International school in JB. Wife still working in SG so kinda difficult at this moment.
 

I'm longing for the time when they have grown up and started working. I can just retire in JB home and for them to come by and visit me  .

Actually, I find renting cheaper than buying house in JB if talking about 20~30years time frame. Moreover, the house prices here don't appreciate that much and that quick too. if short term stay like 10 years, best to rent than to buy.

Best to have the notion that you are buying a property for retirement then for investment. I doubt it is going to raise as much as you see in Singapore. If you want appreciation, try further north such as KL.

Erm..actually depending on who are the developer of the estates. There are locations that I won't say there will be high appreciation but sorta hold their value quite well. 
 

I, for sure not buying a house for the purpose of appeciation. If the estate is secured, well managed and maintained, I would be happy. 
 

Some friends of mine including the locals, only believe in renting not buying in JB.

what about register a malaysian company with name of malaysian wife and the company own the property?



 

That is also 1 way to skin that damm cat. 
 

But if u already got a Msian wife, might as well just put in her name. Got Bumiputra status summore I think its 20% discount on many houses.

Dont expect the price to go up n down like SG houses. There is more for living n less for speculation.
 

Prices r much more stable.

Yes, I saw it at 锦合Deluxe Circle FreshMart (Taman Tan Sri Yacob, opposite Best Mart) last weekend. It is their new house brand product...Frozen one, so you have to cook it. FYI, 锦合 is their local fresh pork specialist. 
 

Thinking of buying it later and try.

Erm..actually depending on who are the developer of the estates. There are locations that I won't say there will be high appreciation but sorta hold their value quite well. 
 

I, for sure not buying a house for the purpose of appeciation. If the estate is secured, well managed and maintained, I would be happy. 
 

Some friends of mine including the locals, only believe in renting not buying in JB.
 

Regards,



 

In Johor u must b very careful of cluster housing n condos as the maintenance is only good for the first few years. After that the mgmt team makan all the RM n if new team take over, ty want u to top up RM otherwise ty cannot run. After a few years the same thing wil happen.
 

That is why I prefer a house by itself as I wont need to depend on those    mgmt companies to run it.
 

Even those with Gurkha guards, maybe only fr the first few years. After that u see all become locals n inside their bags can peek a few bottles of beer for their "night-snack".

Hi, buying is one thing, but what about selling? With so many new developments going on and no lack of land, buyers are spoilt for choice, so if need to sell off a unit that I bought, must sell at lost to garner any interest at all right?

One thing for sure...not that easy to sell. Foreigners usually go for new house than resales house. Usually the locals don't mind to go for resale unit. Again, as it everywhere, location speaks. May be not much in JB but in KL, people like to buy houses near to schools for the obvious reason, particularly for investment purpose.
 

There are so-called new development with many unoccupied units which are stuck for years.

Yes, that was what I hear also, really not easy to sell. As time passes and no buyers, must start to reduce the asking price until one day low enough to attract a buyer. Not like Spore where properties are strong demand but low supply. There is opposite, lots of supply but low demand for resale.
 

So for those who sees it as an "investment", need to find out more first b4 jump in.

Speculation is short term, but what about long term? As your property gets older, even if it is freehold, does it appreciate? If i want to sell 10-15 years later can make a tidy profit?

Investment is good for those big time investor/developer. They build large and luxurious landed houses in JB, which are easily over 1 to a few Million Ringgits. This one, they don't sell you just a piece of land, they sell you a lifestyle too. These are the places, whom the rich ang mos and rich Singaporean will buy. They will try to tell you that it is prime iskandar plot so appreciation is good. Up to one to believe or not. 
 

Unless you are into fengshui, why would you buy a resale unit when there are still many new ones by the left, right, up and down of that area. Not mentioning about other developers are also building houses there.
 

By the way, I was told, local govt doesn't allow any more development of landed home in JB city already. So perhaps, landed home prices may appreciate there.

Those houses is buy to stay fr rest of yr life n then leave it to yr kids.
 

But who knows. In 20-30 years time if the property situation becomes like SG, then u sure can sell at a profit n move to Kelantan or Kedah.
 

Last time say 50-60 years ago, who knew SG property wud b worth so much now.

Dont b too taken in by the "lifestyle" ty sell u.
 

It cud change very quickly. After all/most of the units r sold, the mgmt company can just pull out cos of no more funds. As we all know, most of the RM has already gone into those pples pockets already.  
 

Poor maintenence n no RM was a common problem with those Condos b4. After some time, they become like haunted houses. Lifts not working, urine smell everywhere n druggies n homeless overtake the place.

It looks to me that you have bad experience with apartment living in JB? Anyway, if can have landed house with guarded compound, I believe most Singapore would not want to live in a pigeon hole.
 

Living in condo has never get into my mind when I set food here.
 

Anyway, my idea home in JB would be single storey house with good land size. When you get older, you don't like the staircases.

JB friends told me, another concern beside those that you mentioned would be the security issue. Living in Condo, you can't watch over your car so the tendency of your cars kena scratched and "ill-treated" may happen. Hence, the reason, why most prefer to live in landed house. KL will probably be a different story.

can be done. EL is really damn near to tuas checkpoint ~ 10mins drive @ 90km/h. HH is a further 10mins down the highway.
 

Wuqi of sammyboy (IIRC) claimed he left his front door at 8am at HH, and reaches orchard by 9am. sounds very possible.



 

I have just moved to a bungalow in Horizon Hills. 
 

Today I left my house @ 745am, expecting massive jam at Tuas checkpoint as its Monday morning crowd where people are returning from Malaysia to Singapore to work.
 

There was no Q at both checkpoints and I reach my customer place @ Pinnacle around 830am. Spent some time in jams in AYE though. JB roads I can speed till 120km/hour but when I returned to Singapore my average speed was 30-40km/hour along AYE. Singapore authorities need to wake up and clear the jam as ERP just cannot solve the traffic woes. Look at JB, no ERP but I can speed at 120km/hour during super rush hour.
 

And my house cost just S$1 million. Easily 10 times bigger than a 5 room HDB flat for your info. Sometimes its too big that I dread walking around just to get a glass of water. And my parking pouch can park 10-20 cars easily when I only have 1 SG car and 3 other JB-registered car. Been looking at fountains recently to make my garden more green cos its just too big. Also thinking of constructing a street soccer court for my kids to play soccer.
 

Not that I look down on Sporeans, but I just cannot forget the time when I had to sqeeuze into the lift during rush hour, hury to the MULTI-storey carpark and climb all the way up.. start my engine and drive down the carpark like a clown and then start my morning jam. In the evening, I had to repeat the stupid process again abeit in opposite direction. I get cramps and headache thinking of these poor man lifestyle. One of my Malaysian friends recently told me, Sporeans are so pitiful.. spent the whole life work to repay for a S$500,000 HDB which is not even yours after 99 years. And take bus or MRT still need to squeeze. Drive around also need to Squezze. See doctor, buy makan also need to Squeeze and somemore, pay for parking. 
 

Poor Singaporeans. I am away from this circle and I dont think I can accept staying in a HDB flat with tons of chinaman again!
 

Gold bless.

Hi All
 

I have been looking for a decent place to buy in Nusajaya or Bukit Indah Area...
 

Can't seem to locate the showroom of Horizon Hills so quite sad...
 

Went to see a few properties from Sertia already, dun quite like some of the location and some houses haven't build, prefer ready build house and nice area...
 

Thinking of buying a Terrace or Semi D...
 

I have driven around Horizon Hills I love it there cos its fenced up and away from public plus its a pleasant community...
 

Anyone interested to join me in the house hunt? We can go to show room together.

Frankly, I haven't heard of any break-in in the neighourhood. If you are staying in a landed house with guarded facility, you rarely heard of such break-in. Not to say don't have, just that I've not heard of any in the past 2 years.
 

If you are concern about break-in, you should make landed house that come with guarded compound as your top priority. Some modern estates already equiped their fence with intrusion sensor. If stranger attempt to climb over, the siren will sound.
 

Actually there is this saying that, from the size of the guard house and how well equip is the barrier gate of the development, you can tell how atas is that place.

Just worry, is 500k RM house is considered atas in JB? 
 

I really interested in getting one semi-D there as a holiday house during weekend and maybe as investment cos that area going to be developed under 10th malaysia plan in 5-7 years.
 

If the security is good, then i will not hesistate to get a unit there. I will be looking into area of HH or east ledang or maybe aroun bukit indah area there.

Just worry, is 500k RM house is considered atas in JB? 
 

I really interested in getting one semi-D there as a holiday house during weekend and maybe as investment cos that area going to be developed under 10th malaysia plan in 5-7 years.
 

If the security is good, then i will not hesistate to get a unit there. I will be looking into area of HH or east ledang or maybe aroun bukit indah area there.



 

Yes, RM500K can get you quite a decent landed house in JB already. Taman sutera near to Sutera Mall there you can considered. 
 

I don't fancy those areas that you mentioned as I find them too far away from where I want to go. Bukit Indah is good. Try to pick one near Jusco. I believe Grande is one of those at Bukit Indah. They are now building those larger semi-D and Bungalow. Those would be more expensive but can take a look.
 

Sorry, I will not let people know where I put up in JB for some reasons. You never know what kind of people you have in the internet world.

Hi All
 

I have been looking for a decent place to buy in Nusajaya or Bukit Indah Area...
 

Can't seem to locate the showroom of Horizon Hills so quite sad...
 

Went to see a few properties from Sertia already, dun quite like some of the location and some houses haven't build, prefer ready build house and nice area...
 

Thinking of buying a Terrace or Semi D...
 

I have driven around Horizon Hills I love it there cos its fenced up and away from public plus its a pleasant community...
 

Anyone interested to join me in the house hunt? We can go to show room together.



 

No more showroom in HH. I managed to talk my way into them showing us a soon-to-be occupied semi-D. 
 

some terrace and cluster might have been launched recently

Yap, the HH agent office used to be found along Nusa Bestari but has since been closed.
 

There have been many units that put up for rental at HH for sub RM2K monthly but heard from the local here got no market.

I have just moved to a bungalow in Horizon Hills. 
 

Today I left my house @ 745am, expecting massive jam at Tuas checkpoint as its Monday morning crowd where people are returning from Malaysia to Singapore to work.
 

There was no Q at both checkpoints and I reach my customer place @ Pinnacle around 830am. Spent some time in jams in AYE though. JB roads I can speed till 120km/hour but when I returned to Singapore my average speed was 30-40km/hour along AYE. Singapore authorities need to wake up and clear the jam as ERP just cannot solve the traffic woes. Look at JB, no ERP but I can speed at 120km/hour during super rush hour.
 

And my house cost just S$1 million. Easily 10 times bigger than a 5 room HDB flat for your info. Sometimes its too big that I dread walking around just to get a glass of water. And my parking pouch can park 10-20 cars easily when I only have 1 SG car and 3 other JB-registered car. Been looking at fountains recently to make my garden more green cos its just too big. Also thinking of constructing a street soccer court for my kids to play soccer.
 

Not that I look down on Sporeans, but I just cannot forget the time when I had to sqeeuze into the lift during rush hour, hury to the MULTI-storey carpark and climb all the way up.. start my engine and drive down the carpark like a clown and then start my morning jam. In the evening, I had to repeat the stupid process again abeit in opposite direction. I get cramps and headache thinking of these poor man lifestyle. One of my Malaysian friends recently told me, Sporeans are so pitiful.. spent the whole life work to repay for a S$500,000 HDB which is not even yours after 99 years. And take bus or MRT still need to squeeze. Drive around also need to Squezze. See doctor, buy makan also need to Squeeze and somemore, pay for parking. 
 

Poor Singaporeans. I am away from this circle and I dont think I can accept staying in a HDB flat with tons of chinaman again!
 

Gold bless.



 

How true my fren..
 

The other day I was reading this article saying MM Lee was wise in forcing Singaporeans to have home ownership...but alas this 'ownership' is only 99 years...

price have went up quite bit since 2008 , for 500K most probably can only get link terrace of about 2300sq ft .  Semi would likely to cost 800k liao. Especially those in good locations and higher end developement.

Yes. Generally, JB rental market is weak and usually can't offset the housing loan based on 30 years period. If hoping to use rental to offset the housing loan then it will be an uphill task.

To be a PR, one needs to have either money or skills.  For money, the amount is about six million MYR:

If one only wants a long-term visa, an alternative is joining the MM2H program, which requires five hundred thousand MYR of liquid asset, plus ten thousand MYR of monthly foreign income:

It could mean it is a buyer market out there. In a market where the property don't appreciate that much and there is stock piling of supply, what do you think will happen? Local market can't absorb, so naturally will look for foreigners like you and I. Bear in mind that the better salaried men could be earning like RM3500 monthly, so how many of them can afford RM500K houses?
 

It is also common for the more well to do Johorian to own more than 1 house. Some may buy one that is near to his current place then keep it for the son wedding or daugther and etc. So it will be left vacant. Some are owned by foreigner but never even set foot to live or stay there . They bought with the thought it will appreciate but it never did.
 

I've been to a 3 storey terrace house only join with the right neighgour, the house has been left vacant for 3 years and you see the owner cover all the furniture with cloth machiam like those scene in the movie .  The reason given by the agent is this: The KL son bought this house for the mum to live but mum felt that the house is too big for her alone to live. So she prefers to live in the small kampung house and left the house vacant all this while.

20% cash downpayment..... is that not the same as what you have to pay for private housing here? At least I do. And it's 40% cash for 2nd property (with outstanding loan) now. 
 

RM 500k is what, SGD 220k? You probably can't even get a HDB here. Sorry, I've no clue on HDB prices as I've never bought one before. 200k for a landed property, as a weekend getaway or potential retirement home. I don't see why not. 
 

RM 11k is what, SGD 5k? And stamp duty is absorbed? Even for a 600k studio here you pay over 10k for stamp duty already. (To be fair, you can use CPF to pay though.)
 
 

Pls don't get me wrong -- I'm not coercing people to buy JB houses; only juxtaposing facts.
 

But if you really are keen, I'd suggest you pay with full cash. The housing loan rates are seriously unattractive; and I have not even started on appreciation and rental yields.



 
 

actually I have done some study, to buy for own stay, if we have a plan and can live with those down sides, YES!!!
 

But to buy for investment and hope for appreciation..........................NO, I will never do it in JB.
 

To buy for rental yields, I have yet to hear anyone making $$$ out of it.................
 

And not to forget I am the TS.

As in all cities whether big or small country, the city within the capital is usually more densely populated hence make more economic sense to built apartments. Want to fetch good rental and return without sunk in too much money in a high price property market; as I've said earlier; get those near to schools and colleages especially reputable ones in KL.

Actually, I find renting cheaper than buying house in JB if talking about 20~30years time frame. Moreover, the house prices here don't appreciate that much and that quick too. if short term stay like 10 years, best to rent than to buy.

I totally agree!!! 
 

but if it is buying to stay or to enjoy the space and land, and not think of it as an investment like in Singapore............i think can still consider buying....

Before buying, I actually rent house in JB to test water. Better than sunk it the money straight away. The rental is cheap almost 3 years ago. About RM1350 monthly can get a fully renovated 2 storey terrace with a guarded compound and yet near Sutera Mall. Just opposite where Jasonist is putting up, I suppose. When the rent increase to RM1500, I moved out to near Bukit Indah and for the RM1600 rental I get a completely new 2 storey terrace house ( the owner never live in before) but the size is smaller. The landlord pay for Internet, maintenance fees and etc. I only pay one thing, which is utilities, which is RM40 a month on average. Since I'm alone most of time, the space is more than sufficient.
 

This is the reason why I found paying RM2K for HH rental is expensive and it is further away from shopping centre, makan and amentities.
 

Generally, the local would usually pay around 250K~350K for a decent house based on location and size.

Hi, buying is one thing, but what about selling? With so many new developments going on and no lack of land, buyers are spoilt for choice, so if need to sell off a unit that I bought, must sell at lost to garner any interest at all right?

Those houses is buy to stay fr rest of yr life n then leave it to yr kids.
 

But who knows. In 20-30 years time if the property situation becomes like SG, then u sure can sell at a profit n move to Kelantan or Kedah.
 

Last time say 50-60 years ago, who knew SG property wud b worth so much now.

Not all landed house have guards. Only those probably worth RM350K and above would have a bigger guard house and sentry posts. You also need to look at the development is done by who. The one that I lived in, have morning handover drill and parade, stylo milo.
 

Like what you have mentioned, some are very relaxed, generally the less expensive the estates the less " on the ball" are the guards. I have been to a clustered house estate before and I just mentioned the friend's name and the guard just let me thru without asking for any ID for check.
 

I told my JB friend about this and he told me he is "somebody" in his estate .

thing is..400k RM bungalow is not what you really want... besides a quick check on the mentioned locations will reveal that the bunalow prices at those areas are above 800k RM and that excludes all your interior designs and audio modifications to your house. just a pity that don't have much pics of the homes of those residing in johor. would be nice to see how well maintained is the whole 'neighbourhood' including its facilities after say 5 years?  drive toward larkin direction and you can see so many houses in depilated condition, eg paintwork not done, practically empty buildings etc.  
 

if you buy long term, so many things may change (legislation). Are you confident? u sure they will follow through with the project till the end? look at the causeway...what if next pm come up with another project? no doubt the idea of a bungalow at hdb prices sounds nice though.
 

btw do you think by any longshot that the landswap deal could have some trickle effect to the iskandar devt project?

No way you can get a new 2 storey bungalow at RM400K here with guarded compound. Probably a Terrace House.

Sorry to JB forks but don't think there is this thing call security there.............if you are talking about the guards you see in SG as security to the Condo in JB....................FYI all landed hse area also have guards........report before you enter the compound, once enter is free for all.............



 

Sure or not , free for all ?  Get one 20ft truck with 2 banga , cut open the gate , grills and saw open the fire door and take all you want ?  Nobody give a damn ? All this is happening 3 times in 2 years as reported by that dumb Malisa Lim fr ST

V interesting topic. Like bro Kelpie, I was also thinking more about the children part.
 

its probably np for the adults to go in and out , wake up earlier , etc...  But the kids?
 

Last time i studied in a sec school where my jb classmate waked up like 4-5+ so that they could reach sch by 730 via the bus sekolah. After school, if they have to catch the bus bound for jb. But during the rebellious streak period, teens tend to deliberately miss the bus and loiter around in public places until the evenings... I dun really wish to see that my kid have no place to go back to after school.
 

Also, when u go back home to jb, you will have to like gather the whole family before you can go back... its kindda hard for everyone's time to match each other right?

IMHO, there is no hurry to buy, the prices probably won't snow ball like in Singapore. The important thing is choice of location and ease of access to Singapore.

You can also get those in JB. The question is can you forgo security such as guarded compond and less than ideal location?

I got JB friend who wanted to rent me his vacant Terrace House for RM500 monthly but the fact the it is facing main road and without guarded compound, immediately put me off.
 

Melaka is not my choice because it is still far as compared with ease of access to Singapore. The traffic condition will be quite unbearable if going to stay there for long. JB traffic condition is still not bad for now.

Staying in rental house of about rm500/= is very diffent feeling from owning a nicely renovated Terrace / Semi D leh !   Will give you a damn siok feeling for a small price !

Hi bros , 

Surely you can find something you like if you narrow down your search and expectations.

My preference is also 2nd link area because of the Wang factors .  Here you have two choice , a) those virgin areas like East Ledang , Ledang Height, Medinni , Lesure Farm prices are high as they are targetting investors and selling based on LifeSyle concept . Prepare to pay around rm600K for terrace and maybe 1M for Semi D in these areas . I dont think the locals will be able to accept such high price. Hence you may see lot of speculation betting the area will boom in very near future as we got lots of high class thingy coming out very soon .  Currently I think that place is not so livable yet maybe got to wait 5yrs to 10yrs lor !  

b ) Bukit Indah Circle where Jusco is located ,  anything within 5KM of indah circle is consider very livable as we got lots of big shopping malls and shops to service you untill late at night 2 to 3 am also no problem. Streets are well lighted at night , no problem.  Here you will find good mix of low end and high end houses .  You can look at big developer like Tannah Sutera a jv with keppel and capital land , Horizon hill (a bit out of way , but LifeStyle type lor ) prepare to pay a slight premium for these two . We also have Setia Bukit Indah ,  Bukit Indaman ,  Nusa Duta and Nusa Bestari.  Buy from any of these , you cant be very wrong .  Just make sure they are Gated / Guard , alarm provided better still if got good mix of locals and not too cheap type below rm 400K .  Otherwise the place will be dark on a weekday when all the SGean are back to work lor !

Got a few friends and colleagues living in JB who travel to school/work every day here in Singapore. Kinda envy them sometimes, with their halved living expenses, halved costs of running a car, and freedom to just drive up somewhere for a quick getaway. 
 

But came in at 4pm from JB today and the Singapore customs are KNNCCB irritating! Even on such a non-peak day & hour, the queues were absolutely ridiculous! Especially leading to the car checkpoint. Afterwhich, everybody converges into ONE small lane that leads out to mainland Singapore. Don't they KNOW that that causes traffic tailbacks and jams? Or do they do it on purpose?! If the latter is true, which most probably is the case, what sort of malicious, sadistic people are running the show? Btw, the Malaysian end was smooth sailing all the way!
 

Can't imagine doing this everyday so Nope, won't stay in JB despite all the perks...

When buying a landed property in JB, make sure that it is a guarded and gated, I had personally bought one in Austin Height in 2003 when it was launched, the price then was RM300K. I like it there cos the layout of all rooms are ensuite, near Austin Hill Golf Resort. Then they built Sunway College, International School, Jusco and their new Sultan Ismail Hospital. I just sold it last December at RM500k, and my relatives in JB was very surprise cos their own landed homes do not appreciate as much (non security). 
 

I had just bought another at East Ledang, though the price is much higher, cos of the committed development over there. Environment there is superb, with open garden concept which you can only find in in Ang Mo country (not even in Singapore) not to worry as security very tight (if your host is not at home you can never enter the precint). For those still contemplating in buying, study carefully, but make sure it is guarded and gated.

Hi brother
 

I know what i want.
 

1. Guarded

2. Fenced UP compound

3. Fenced UP house
 

thats what attract me to HH
 

So I am looking for similar. The one that Sertia is marketing dun seem so exciting. I checked out Sertia Eco Garden, it was really cheap RM215 only for single storey but the place abit ulu leh...
 

I am looking to buy a terrace house for retirement in the future, will semi retire 10 years from now hahahaha but I like to plan ahead, hopefully 30 years from now the place will be developed :) I already have an apartment in KL that is rented out. But I would like to live in JB cos its nearer. Most of my friends have already bought Australia (Perth, Sydney, Melbourne), London and USA (New York) so most of my friends are moving out 10-20 years from now... I dun want to be stuck here alone hahahahaha
 

Cheers brother, if you know of any place launching near you do let me know.... thanks so much, appreciate it
 

Thanks for all the valuable information btw :)

There is a condominium project at the entrance of East Ledang.  Just that the sales data I obtained a few months ago shows most units have been sold.  There is one more at Puteri Harbor, but this is not cheap, probably above 600k MYR each.  Condominiums at Bukit Indah and Horizon Hills are cheaper, but I do not think they will have the same standard as the first two.  I stay in Bukit Indah, and have visited Horizon Hills and East Ledang, so my perception may not be too far off the reality.    But then, it depends on your expectations.

why we are not keen in condo is cos we dun want to to be in the mercy of the mcst if it becomes a shitty one.. i rather be responsible for my own maintance so i choose landed..
 

we have an apartment in port dickson and one in malacca... the one in port dickson looks like a war zone.. when my family goes to port dickson we stay hotel and not the apartment cos the whole place is a dump.. we go for holiday not go and be stress out.. anyway the last time i was at port dickson was 2005, never go for so long le... both units recently are now rented out, port dickson, well its a bad investment lah, we take it as we lost the money in shares or something and we try not to think about it.. there got too many apartments and too many half way projects... there is no demand... somemore the mcst damn horrible, first month got the house the ceilings and wall leaking.. we paid quite alot to get others to fix after we got pissed off that 8 months into it and it didnt recitify but other places effect (the mcst was the developer btw)... so freaking sick of it.. u know what its like to come home after months and see the house flooded? it stinks like s--t.. not funny lor.. lucky we were lightly furnished.. we have a small 4 seater dining table, 2 seater sofa and a small fridge with no food, all have to throw... cos got damaged when the house flooded.. so we have to redo the house and seal up the walls plus paint the whole house white.. we tore down the kitchen cabinet below and those above cooking hood stay... even some flooring got damaged and lightings as well... vomit blood... spend quite a large sum and now its ok.. talk to the mcst for 1 whole year really good for nothing...
 

i think besides us alot of sgreans dump their money there.. port dickson and desaru... but think desaru became impiana and now lotus... my port dickson condo is just a condo... well port dickson was cheap la, already fully paid for... oh well sigh..
 

anyway condo the facilities first few years good after that maybe become a disaster, like my place not properly maintained its a 50-50 chance so there is no telling... 
 
 

But my malacca place is still ok... but old

HK and SZ is not that free...and there are also customs like JB and SG. and PRC still need to apply visas for entry into HK.



 
 

Ya lah. Just saying as an example of hopes for the future. Just like b4 SG n MY split. Can go over without passport even. Just drive across the cway that time.

When buying a landed property in JB, make sure that it is a guarded and gated, I had personally bought one in Austin Height in 2003 when it was launched, the price then was RM300K. I like it there cos the layout of all rooms are ensuite, near Austin Hill Golf Resort. Then they built Sunway College, International School, Jusco and their new Sultan Ismail Hospital. I just sold it last December at RM500k, and my relatives in JB was very surprise cos their own landed homes do not appreciate as much (non security). 
 

I had just bought another at East Ledang, though the price is much higher, cos of the committed development over there. Environment there is superb, with open garden concept which you can only find in in Ang Mo country (not even in Singapore) not to worry as security very tight (if your host is not at home you can never enter the precint). For those still contemplating in buying, study carefully, but make sure it is guarded and gated.



 

how much is the property you bought at East Ledang? Is the maintenance fee high? how many square feet?

This one I never try before lah, but I do know things happen there lor...............
 

I never buy any condom for any man on the street before, so cannot comment, but condo in SG, I do own one and staying in it, so that part I do know a little.



 

I know most condo in SG b4 the workers come, resident must apply permit or somesort n inform guard in advance so ty know its genuine.
 

In JB I dunno if movers or contractors need to inform guards in advance or not?
 

But I hv heard from my Msian frens that sometimes the thieves take anything ty can including the metal main gate to sell. This was for landed property.
 

Best part neighbours saw the truck taking everything away n thought the owner was moving out. Hahaha.

yup i`m drivin a sg car~ and i`m a singaporean~ my wife is a msian~ my bro and mother in law stay with us~ so sometime i drive his msia plate myvi around when i`m bak~



 

Hi Pklim.
 

Can I check with u how is the water supply N pressure at these places n also is the electricity 2 or 3 phase?
 

I know the older houses water pressure is bad so most hv a big tank on the roof which can cause some structural damage in the long run due to the weight. And the electricity was usually 2 phase n the quality is not that good.
 

Have all these problems been addressed in the newer houses?

Got a few friends and colleagues living in JB who travel to school/work every day here in Singapore. Kinda envy them sometimes, with their halved living expenses, halved costs of running a car, and freedom to just drive up somewhere for a quick getaway. 
 

But came in at 4pm from JB today and the Singapore customs are KNNCCB irritating! Even on such a non-peak day & hour, the queues were absolutely ridiculous! Especially leading to the car checkpoint. Afterwhich, everybody converges into ONE small lane that leads out to mainland Singapore. Don't they KNOW that that causes traffic tailbacks and jams? Or do they do it on purpose?! If the latter is true, which most probably is the case, what sort of malicious, sadistic people are running the show? Btw, the Malaysian end was smooth sailing all the way!
 

Can't imagine doing this everyday so Nope, won't stay in JB despite all the perks...



 

Run by mostly paranoid pple who r always scared of being killed. Maybe ty got too many enemies? 
 

The idea of all lanes bottleneck into 1 lane is so ty can easily close the lanes by just blocking the exit.
 

I doubt they bothered about the jams ty cause cos as far as ty r concerned, thats our problem, not theirs.

Hi brother
 

I know what i want.
 

1. Guarded

2. Fenced UP compound

3. Fenced UP housethats what attract me to HH
 

So I am looking for similar. The one that Sertia is marketing dun seem so exciting. I checked out Sertia Eco Garden, it was really cheap RM215 only for single storey but the place abit ulu leh...
 

I am looking to buy a terrace house for retirement in the future, will semi retire 10 years from now hahahaha but I like to plan ahead, hopefully 30 years from now the place will be developed :) I already have an apartment in KL that is rented out. But I would like to live in JB cos its nearer. Most of my friends have already bought Australia (Perth, Sydney, Melbourne), London and USA (New York) so most of my friends are moving out 10-20 years from now... I dun want to be stuck here alone hahahahaha
 

Cheers brother, if you know of any place launching near you do let me know.... thanks so much, appreciate it
 

Thanks for all the valuable information btw :)



 

Maybe u r not looking for a home. More like a prison?

Of cos you must take loan from M'sian banks. As for the interest rates, can you call a M'sian banker and share with us the information.

Sorry, this is the smallest landed size you can get at East Ledang, there are no more terraces that will be launch in East Ledang. The last few phases are Semi-D and Bungalow.

OK thanks cos I know last time water pressure low n electricity is 2 phase which is not so good. Also many power trips.
 

Seems like these problems still never solve. 
 

Most older houses have a water tank on the roof.
 

Its better to get a place near an industrial estate cos there is mostly 3 phase electricity n maybe ty have a big water tank on top of a hill to supply water to surrounding areas.

Hmm....  What is the correlation between the number of phases for each house and power trips?  Without 3-phase AC, each house still has 60 A of supply, I think.  The average voltages for 2- and 3--phase systems probably do not differ too much (sorry, have not revised power engineering for too long, and have been living in the mostly DC world). 
 

A water tank in each house can be useful, especially when there is pipe maintenance that disrupts water supply for several hours to several days.  I noticed some families suffered, because they modified their pipes to connect to the main (as the pressure from the main is higher), and so did not have water to bath when there was maintenance work.  Usually, a few days of water supply disruption should have negligible impact on residents.

For all info, road tax in JB is a mere S$50 per year for their locally-made cars. Normal Honda civic, Lancer EX etc road tax is estimated S$100-S$200 a year.
 

Power/water bills for landed house ( on 5 aircon 23 hours a day ), 5 computers running 20 hours a day, 3 TV running 10 hours per day, 5 fans 20 hours a day, water hose with strong pressure on for 1 whole hour a day for washing car and car pouch... the bill is about S$80. 
 

I know many ( 95% ) of Malaysia landed houses have power/water bills of S$10 a month. Just be careful if u are doing notti things. Haha. 
 

Singapore electricity bills for my condo ( I stay alone and is in my condo for average 3 hours a day ).. my bill is S$100 per month already. Only open tap to wash my mouth and face for 1 minute a day.

3 pahse current is a better quality as opposed to 2 phase. It lets u charge yr mobile faster fr example. Yr electrical equipment wil work more efficiently too. Maybe TV less flicker n yr equip wil last longer as it doesnt hv to work so hard to do the same job.
 

Water tank on roof can b bad cos the weight of it can cause the structure to give way after some time. If ty hv a big tank on a hill nearby, it wil also solve the problem of no water during a pipe failure as its mostly b4 the water tank.

Apartments/condo is safer there. Less chance of break-in. Its also safer/better for older folks cos not so open n exposed to the crooks.
 

Harder fr them to select,observe, monitor n break-in.

Ya so thats why as property developers r targeting Sporeans, ty come up with these cluster housing with fenced up, gated n guarded to put us at ease.
 

Just b careful all these "security" features dont disappear after all the houses r sold.

Then these security r good. 
 

Only fear is ty disappear after a few years n the low paid, low quality guards take their place. Then like no security even. Or sometimes the security wil case the houses n partner with the thieves telling which units to hit.

But if u really look at the whole picture, everything in SG is EXPENSIVE so its not surprising.

OK so Ins is not much cheaper.
 

Maybe cos so many cars get stolen there. A lot of claims. 
 

Anyway if I get a cheepo relaible old Toyota, it sud b quite safe.   I like the Camry n Garcia models.

Looking at the pricing, we can get a Peugeot 407 or 3008 for abt what we pay here fr a Thai made Jap car like Altis. Can say about half of what we wil pay here fr a similar model then.  BTW r these Peugeots assembled in Msia/Asia or fully imported from France?
 

I know yr Mercs got 2 types. MY assembled(cheaper) or German made(more ex).

I think only Bestari (206) and 207 sedan were/are assembled in Malaysia (their local assemblies were officially announced).  The others should be completely imported ones.  But, according to the brochures, 207, 308 and 407 are all CKD, that is, locally assembled.  May be those in Peugeot clubs know better.

Ya but even our loans here hv an effective rate of abt 7-8% although ty advertise 2-3% only.  Must check the effective rate in MY then to compare. 
 

Take loan to to get full use of yr RM. If taking loan is about the same "cost" as paying in cash, might as well take loan. 
 

Can say make full use of cheap RM.

These are the typical car hire-purchase/loan interest rates in Malaysia:
 

http://www.directaccess.com.my/index.php?c...;tpt=cimb_bank#
 

(click the "interest rates" tab)
 

For a new national car, the fixed rate is 3.x percent.  Some non-national cars seem have lower rates, like 1.x to 2.x percent.

For all info, road tax in JB is a mere S$50 per year for their locally-made cars. Normal Honda civic, Lancer EX etc road tax is estimated S$100-S$200 a year.
 

Power/water bills for landed house ( on 5 aircon 23 hours a day ), 5 computers running 20 hours a day, 3 TV running 10 hours per day, 5 fans 20 hours a day, water hose with strong pressure on for 1 whole hour a day for washing car and car pouch... the bill is about S$80. 
 

I know many ( 95% ) of Malaysia landed houses have power/water bills of S$10 a month. Just be careful if u are doing notti things. Haha. 
 

Singapore electricity bills for my condo ( I stay alone and is in my condo for average 3 hours a day ).. my bill is S$100 per month already. Only open tap to wash my mouth and face for 1 minute a day.



 

You never shower is it?

Thieves strike before new residents move in

By Carolyn Quek

Some new flats at City View @ Boon Keng (above) and River Vista @ Kallang were broken into by thieves who stole items such as television sets. They tampered with the number-combination locks securing the main doors. -- ST PHOTO: MUGILAN RAJASEGERAN
 

WITHIN weeks of getting their keys, some residents in two recently completed Housing Board developments in Bendemeer have had their new homes broken into.
 

These flats were still being renovated, but electrical appliances such as television sets had been moved in, and these were the items the thieves got their hands on.

It is extremely difficult for foreigner to get Malaysia permanent residency. you must be the spouse or children of Malaysia citizen in order to be qualify for applying PR. you are out of luck if you do not have those family ties to Malaysia citizen. 
 

you can try to apply for "Malaysia My Second Home Programme". this is a program that allow foreigner to stay in Malaysia as long as possible on a social visit pass with a multiple entry visa.

http://www.mm2h.gov.my/

or get Malaysia work visa. you must get a job offer from a company in Malaysia. Malaysian immigration department won't issue one to you without a job offer from a company in Malaysia.

So is this a confirmation that SG gharmen is scared many pple wil leave n stay in W Msia so again ty make it as difficult as possible?
 

Now even if u own a property in SG, ty dont allow u to buy a foreign(Read Msia) property.
 

If ty always say SG is such a good place, why ty so scared many Sillyporeans wil leave fr Msia then?
 

We sud b encouraged to spread our roots far n wide to benefit SG when we start businesses there n link up wh SG for mutual benefit.

Its so very clear ty just scared so many citizens want to run away so ty make it as difficult as possible.
 

Wait too many citizens run away many countries  also ask why so many of yr own citizens run away when u say u treat them so well n end up u have to bring in all sorts of foreigners to fill the empty places.
 

Something is simply just not right.

Hi All
 

I have been looking for a decent place to buy in Nusajaya or Bukit Indah Area...
 

Can't seem to locate the showroom of Horizon Hills so quite sad...
 

Went to see a few properties from Sertia already, dun quite like some of the location and some houses haven't build, prefer ready build house and nice area...
 

Thinking of buying a Terrace or Semi D...
 

I have driven around Horizon Hills I love it there cos its fenced up and away from public plus its a pleasant community...
 

Anyone interested to join me in the house hunt? We can go to show room together.



 

yo when are you going in to HH? I tag along leh.

What about property tax in Msia?



 

I think each town or city has its own property tax rate.  For Nusajaya and areas under MPJBT, it should be around 0.14 percent.  That is, if the town council believes a house is worth 500k MYR, then the property tax is 500k x 0.14 / 100 = 700 MYR per year.  The bill is split into two parts.  A house owner receives one part every half a year.  Like virtually all other bills, it is payable by credit card over the Internet.

Only good class condo have better qualified guards and better security features such as 3 tiers access. 
 

Landed is in a way better because you can have nice neighbours to watchout for you too in additional to 3 tiers security access.

It is very common for good class landed community to have guarded compound. Not only in Malaysia but other countries as well. 
 

Mostly freehold and leasehold is still less common.

My humble suggestion is you don't go into hurry to buy one. You can actually rent one for a year or so to 1st experience the lifestyle here before putting all your money in JB property. In case you don't know, foreigners can only purchase property not less than 500K..

Cost of living is not low in JB. Some stuff over there are more expensive actually. You just check out their shopping centres and food court and you will know what I mean. 
 

Yes, your S$5 here is RM10 there. But the item price you pay here may be S$5 but cost RM10 there, so back to square one again!

Not so bad as some put it. You gotta live here to experience the lifestyle here.




Yalor. Its not so bad until you can't walk the streets at all. A lot depends on luck and also knowing what to do to keep yourself there safe. Malaysians living there survive like that also.

My humble suggestion is you don't go into hurry to buy one. You can actually rent one for a year or so to 1st experience the lifestyle here before putting all your money in JB property. In case you don't know, foreigners can only purchase property not less than 500K..
 

Regards,



 

Fully agreed, friend bot one hse there for his two kids and wife, travel to SG to work every day. But end up sold the hse cos friend didnt feel safe to leave small kids and wife there alone. Now they all stay in SGP. Try to rent a hse there for 6mths or one yr. If u like then buy.

Great advice, I will consider it nearer to my retirement, another location I think is relatively low cost to retire in is Dong Guan.

My understanding is that for non essential goods, JB is the same or more expensive, but for daily essentials like Milk, it's much cheaper, I have relatives who go there buy cantons of milk at half price.

If you consider

Cost of living in MY is actually very high, higher than SG.
 

The reason it appears cheap to us is the exchange rate difference and we are earning our keeps in SG in SGD.

Am wondering why you guys are keen on JB properties. Generally its better to rent, cos rentals are so cheap there. If buy to stay immediately is fine but if buy with intention to rent, its a bad idea cos the rate of returns are quite bad and often cannot collect rental? Buy to keep empty is a worst idea. If keen on Msian properties the best route is to invest in prime KL properties. In outskirts you can pay 300k for a house and 15 years later still 300k!

need not sell it right? keep it till retire then they move in, while renting out the hdb for passive income.

their kids would have grown up, or even have their own houses.

just did a quick google... it seems true, to what i've heard too.

buy a rm$500k property, but can only fetch up to rm$2k rental a month.

The selling price to Malaysian is only approx half of the price they sell to Singaporeans. There's no way Singaporeans can profit from renting out.

Foreigners can get retirement visas, which are similar to the MM2H program in Malaysia.  Both require deposits in local banks.  Thailand currently has a much lower requirement though - 800k THB during application and renewal.  If one has a few million dollars, it is easy to get permanent residence, whether in Singapore (confirmed), Thailand (limited vacancies) or Malaysia (not very sure about Malaysia), may be also in US and Australia (just a guess).  I believe for a purely (English + Chinese)-educated Singaporean, it is easier to get US or Australian citizenship, compared to becoming a citizen in Thailand or Malaysia, due to language requirements.
 

There are lots of articles on the Internet about retiring in Thailand, mostly written by Europeans, Americans and Australians.  May be few are known in Singapore, because somehow SEA countries are not popular retirement places for Singaporeans, though geographically, culturally, socially, racially and in terms of climate, they are probably the closest.

Yeah houses fetch poor rentals & not easy to rent. Sometime need to wait for months. The other consideration is that many properties are marked up to clear the 500k hurdle. If you are Malaysian, you will have more choices at better prices. Hence I think considered lucky if can rent out a 500k property for 2k. Who will pay? The locals? Foreigners? Not that many foreigners in JB unless you count the illegal immigrants haha.

My understanding is that for non essential goods, JB is the same or more expensive, but for daily essentials like Milk, it's much cheaper, I have relatives who go there buy cantons of milk at half price.




What I know is the essential items (like milk, rice, sugar, salt, etc) cannot be taken out of Malaysia. You can be stopped at JB customs and checked and fined...but of course we all know nobody check it when we exit.  
 

My opinion is that if you only drive into JB to buy all these essential stuff, and come back, then its not worth the trouble due to the time/petrol/other reasons factored in.

I guess I have to do my research in due course, I have girl friends who are engaged to Australians and they seem very happy with the lifestyle there, perhaps it's more laid back compared to the rat race in Singapore. 800K THB is about $40K Singapore, should not be too difficult to get the retirement visa then, sound feasible, can go there every day go massage, drink and eat.

Exactly.
 

The only ones who can benefit from this logic are those who worked in SG, and lived in JB. They travel in/out eveyday by car or motorcycle. Some are SPR. Earn S$, convert RM and spend in MY. These guys enjoyed the best of both worlds.

If you are talking about food, it is true that Johorian are paying a high price. However, when you start to look at the low housing cost, low cost of car ownership, low utility bill & etc, it is still affordable.
 

For the poor, they can live in RM40K flat. Buy a cheap car without a fixed lifespan (eg COE), car park mostly free, petrol also got govt subsidy and the list goes on.
 

By the way, Singapore is the 9th most expensive city in the world and Malaysia is numbered 74th so how come Cost of living in MY is more expensive than in SG based your view?

Regards,




To a Malaysian who earns his salary in RM, the cost of housing/car ownership is not low. The houses there also cost as much as a HDB flat, but of course its at least a terrace house. 
 

Car ownership is low if only you buy a Malaysian made car like Proton, Pedorua, Naza, etc. If buy import models like Toyota or Honda, its can be even more expensive than in SG (if don't consider the FX diff).
 

The petrol subsidy I tot already taken away isn't it???

Car ownership is low if only you buy a Malaysian made car like Proton, Pedorua, Naza, etc. If buy import models like Toyota or Honda, its can be even more expensive than in SG (if don't consider the FX diff).
 

The petrol subsidy I tot already taken away isn't it???



 

How much is one 3 room flat in SG? I already said a flat cost RM40K in JB. A low cost terrace house should be around RM150K. Dollar to Dollar, how to fight?
 

We are talking about commoners here and not everyone can afford imported car. In SG, Toyota or Honda also cost more than a Proton. Dollar to Dollar, how much is a Proton in JB if you compare one in SG?
 

95 is still there for the commoners.

Many stupid sinkies think that mudland everything is free. Petrol is also free. Rm1.8 per liter for malaysians are cheap in our views but expensive in their views. The average monthly salary of malaysians is about rm1500... And they r forced to drive because public transports r near non existent
 

I love singapore.

To be fair, those whose salaries are around 1.5k MYR are not forced to drive.  They do so for face, most of the time.  My relatives and family members in/near my home town have salaries ranging from 1.6k to 2.xk MYR.  They do not drive.  I have not been driving there the past couple of years either.  No public transport serving housing areas and towns does not mean people have to buy cars.
 

By the way, a pretty good condition five-year-old used car is only about 10-15k MYR.  My first car was only 8.8k MYR (which was about the price of two new motorcycles) when I bought it about 9 years ago.  It was only three years old then.  After using it for another three years, I sold it for 1.4k MYR.

Where got so simple, bro! 

Must take into consideration the jam, travel time, etc. Its not worth the trouble.
 

Those who do this is becos their family is in JB, so they travel in/out everyday. Somehow they don't have a choice also.




There are many Sporeans that stay in Bukit Indah and they use 2nd link everyday. Have you heard them complaining

about jam. A lot of my ex colleagues friends are now staying in and working in SG. In fact they car pool to come SG

every week, saving even more. For your info, BI to SG thru 2nd link is about 20 mins. of travel.

Go by 2nd Link usually no jam. But got to pay toll, both ways. 
 

I never hear these travelers complaining. Cos I don't have friends doing it. But that doesn't mean they are enjoying their daily 20mins journey in/out thru 2nd Link. 
 

Its a very subjective matter. Some like it, some don't. In the end, there are pros and cons, like in any situation.

Frankly, I hardly heard people want to retire in China. Those who do are probably those whose wife is a PRC citizen. 
 

So Dongguan is in Guangzhou? You confirm or not? 
 

I never heard of Changping. Where is this place?

Buy and keep for weekend and future retirement. When u are at retirement age, no bank will wanna give u loan for property. 

Use that hdb for retirement income as u will unlikely be working for people, unless wiping tables.

If you want to live in JB, but have your kids educated in SG, you got no choice. Many JB kids do that everyday, by school bus, but their school are usually around the Woodlands area. 
 

Best solution is to stay in SG during weekdays, then in weekends move to JB to relax in your big house.

seems like she is aiming for investment, not as retirement/weekend home.

imo also, jb is not for investment unlike sg. current appreciation (such as hype at horizon hills) is pushed by sg and other foreigners. 

wait till the ec, condo, hdb excess surplus, lesser FW/FT demand and possible financial crisis hit home, then jb will probably go back to square one.. 
 

get stuck and cannot sell. those dudes who bought for investment, good luck to them. 
 

that's why i thought it is good for weekend/retirement, wanting to stay in a cheap location yet still very near sg.

agree! and dun get a big big house if it's for retirement (personal view even thou u can afford it - coz retirement house mah otherwise u n yr wife will spend most of the time cleaning the hse! heehhehe...)
 

personally, go for those simple and easy to maintain type...no need huge huge hse with plenty of land...otherwise no retirement...continue to work ie cleaning the hse!! 

also, becareful of the crime - ensure it is G&G....we all know how safe is JB lah...in the end, if buy big hse, also worry...coz a lot of ppl will be eying u....
 

my 2 cents..

Yeah once the FT's aka robbers know you are an old couple with lots of money you will be a painted target there. Actually I wonder why need to buy a house if retired? Just rent then can move around more fun and can experience new cultures? Like 1 year stay in Camerons, 1 year stay in Penang, Thailand or even Phillipines or China etc. Rental is sooo cheap & plenty of units to choose from. If fact can bargain siong siong cos v few people want to rent & many "investors" are stuck. You can pass by Horizon Hill or Bukit Indah and see the huge for rent banners. Some property empty for years after completion and after the owner get over the novelty of staying there. 
 

No need to be near Sg? Unless for some reason always need to go Sg. If really need to be in Sg then just stay in Sg & no need to hassle be trapped in jam. 
 

 Sometimes have a house is a liability if say town planning not good then flooding, then everything gets wiped out?

Most happy people do not use the causeway.  They use the second-link, whose high toll charges ensure a pleasant journey most of the time.
 

The causeway is a problematic place.  Its users do not want toll charges to be increased, but forgetting that low charges make it heavily congested (like a hell?  ), and then complaining about the jam, but do not want an effective and easily implementable solution.
 

In any case, if you can afford a house in East Ledang, why bother about the causeway?

about renting.. while cheap, it will still be a liability where your retirement savings will be eaten away.

taking an assumption the hdb rental can fetch S$2k, and the terrace rental is RM2k. Your retirement passive income is already lesser than another person who owns the terrace while renting out the hdb.

it also makes more sense as the jb property is freehold.. u can pass it down to your next generation (if the future sg property becomes too nonsensical, such as 60yr leasehold!)

security is the only concern.. need to find a good neighborhood and security measures (best to get one neighbor with a datuk or a minister  ) .

Anyone here bought or thinking of buying a house in JB?



 

I am planning to buy a retirement house there too. I am divorced and single without a HDB. Henceforth, the ruling set up to curb excessive investment (cooling measure) i.e. buy HDB cant buy private for 5 years is a torment to me.
 

Currently, the HDB prices are still expensive to me (in consideration to the COV). My dilenma is commit a house in JB ==> cant buy HDB. Then if my mum will to pass on here in SG I will be homeless in SG. If i buy a HDB here first, then its most certainly I cant buy a house in JB for the 5 years after that. I am not taking the HDB nor JB house as any investment resort at all.
 

To buy HDB or a place in SG is to utilise my CPF (otherwise, there is no way to see the little money in CPF back when I am alive). To buy a house in JB 

is for living in future (I just feel totally annoyed and frustrated to be in SG which is getting more and more crowded everywhere I go)
 

If they really increase the occupant size to 6.5 million here, I can imagine how suffocating it is to be in SG. Are they going to implement COE for getting out of our home in the future? i.e. to restrict the usage of the public areas and avoid congestion?

One the other hand say even for a modest 500k property( which presumably is fully paid) , the same amount in FD will receive a return of 15k pa at rate of 3%. The rate of returns for JB property is miserable. If for investment buy in KL. At least can get 5-6%.

DO you have friends or relatives in JB? If not, why wanna stay there? Everywhere you stay, there are pros and cons. So you picked a place to live/retire which you feel most comfortable with.
 

The congested places in SG are still the public transport and town areas, or maybe HDB heartlands central areas. If you drive and don't go out much, you would not really feel the congestion.

can u add your name to the house your mom owns? it forms a family cluster right? unless your other siblings contest it.. 

this way, you are one of the owner of the hdb without having the need to buy another one.

Some friends there in JB but no relatives there as yet. I am looking at the cost and conducisveness for future retirement, and therefore, it doesnt matter to me if there are friends or relatives there.
 

Everytime I got myself out of SG, I just feel so relaxed be it 10,000 miles or just 50 miles away from SG. Its not just the distance, its about being away from everything here.
 

Dont go out to crowded places??? Haha....I have already tried my best not to be in crowded areas by driving to places that only are less convenient for public commuters. And yet I must say......everywhere is crowded to me still.

Stay in JB is not cheap either. The standard of living there can be worse than in JB...
 

If you can relax only when out of SG, then what happens after you stay JB after a few years? You probably want to get of of JB to relax as well too.. 
 

Sometimes a place is crowded can be a good thing. Too ulu or quiet you may feel bored and empty. Of course also the "type" of crowd also matters. Just my opinion only lah.

Sometimes a place is crowded can be a good thing. Too ulu or quiet you may feel bored and empty. Of course also the "type" of crowd also matters. Just my opinion only lah.



 

True. Thats why I still intend to make my money here in SG while semi retiring in JB. I can take it well if its just a few hours here a day, and most of my time spent hibernating in JB

If buy now, still able to avoid the above, only thing now the prices have gone up quote high in Nusajaya and Iskandar in general.
 

Look harder and still able to find some reasonable pricing, just make sure is Gated and Guarded for Safety issue.

Thought it should be more appropriate to be in English since they are expecting to attrach foreigner, majority of the staff at Lego land also Malay,no wonder so many Chinese left Malaysia and sought for opportunity else where,if only Malaysia Government recoginse this,there will be no improvement there,unlike in singapore whereby opportunity are given to all races.Thats the reason why MM Lee was kick out from Malaysia when their policy was not in-line.

Out of curosity, why can't those landed houses come with cement concrete ceiling (just like flats)? So that when the real roof leak, it won't affect internal. 
 

All houses I see is a sloping real roof covered by tiles with just too many joints (which is not very hardy and reliable to begin with), below it is the false ceiling.

depends on you.

bank loan interest in MY is not low after minus BLR is about 4.88%

If possible put down payment higher.
 

Usually for income earners in SGP no issues, same principle applies, depending on your income capability loan how much.

depends, there is never a definite price, cause of the extent of renovation you wish to do.

but i give you a price to guage, one of the units that I leased out, I did some simple renovation for below rm100k for 2400sqf, just simple tiling, kitchen and toilet excluding furniture.

er... I think loan is 80% and 20% by cash for downpayment for foreigners.

restrictions such as rm500k property still apply currently.

stamp duty depends on developer sometimes its absorbed.
 

oh i forget to mention, for 1st or 2nd property, you can loan up to 80%, for third property onwards depends on your commitment with banks, may only loan up till cap of 60%-70% cap.

yearly you also have to pay the land tax (depending on state and size)

for first loan, which bank you go to and your income level are the important factors.
 

one or two banks can give up to 90% if your income is high enough
 

others may be just 80-85% with same income....
 

80% is the norm .
 

3rd house is at most 70 % i understand ...
 

so if you intend to buy a few units there, put each loan under one single name (e.g. husband and wife names not in the same loan) is better if you need to loan higher %.
 

but buy house in jb is long tedious process, it can be as long as 6mths or more for the property to be under your name...so its good to plan early...

AFAIK, currently there are many bank loan packages in M'sia which allow you to offset the interest through your deposit, but of course you need to park your money there.

For example, if you loan an amount of RM1mil, and you have deposit RM300k being parked in this account. The interest is calculated on the basis of RM700k and not RM1mil. The benefit is that you don't have to throw all the lump sum in.

I think you are a bit out of touch with recent property market in JB.

Contrary to the usual perception in the past, JB property valuation has increased by quite a big margin for the past 1-2 years. High end condo with asking price of ~RM800psf is becoming a norm there. All thanks to our own Singaporeans. Else their government won't be targeting a benchmark of RM1mil minimum price for foreigners.

Profit from sub sale market is not too bad either, but of course it is largely dependent on the areas you are in.

I think you have misunderstood my post.

I did not say that the prices / valuation are not going up.

I am talking about liquidity.

Malaysians wont buy condos, they buy land, only stupid singaporean will.

Singaporean wont buy secondhand condos, they rather new ones.
 

So in the end developers are the ones winning becos they just continue increasing the price and people(singaporeans) bite.
 

Even the best condos in the heart of KL have problems liquidating due to the fact than condos and high priced properties are only demanded by foreigners.  
 

But thats my personal opinion and understanding, i could be wrong.

I just put my money where my mouth is and my mouth where my money is, thats all.

Good luck all.
 

Unless you hv a lot of resources and can move money back and forth easily, my bet is certainly not with the Ringgit.

But i am happy that some people go to JB, they seem like they belong there anyway

Yup, buy to stay/retirement would be better than buying JB house for investment.

I wonder why would any Singaporeans wanna buy high floor condos instead of landed? If I were them I'm already sick and tired of living in a pigeonhole & would want a landed instead.

Living in condo has its advantages too! Like good scenery (if facing a good view), more windy, security guards, swimming pool (JB has very few pools), facilities, etc.... so many Singaporeans still prefer condos.

Singaporeans buying JB condos mainly because of 1 reason - Security!

Buying condo is still more secured than buy a big house outside town areas. How many cases of house-breaking per year?

Okay..Kinda agreed with the views and security. Cuz boleh land quite vast, a view from 10 storeys already will give you a bird's eye view of the surrounding.

Not to mention, Condo's pricing are already on par or higher than landed according to property guru My.

Actually condo is not really safe also....

if you read my early posts in the forum earlier, I myself have lost my vehicle whilst staying in the condo.

Nowadays most new gardens or tamans are gated regardless of condo or landed.

AFAIK, currently there are many bank loan packages in M'sia which allow you to offset the interest through your deposit, but of course you need to park your money there.

For example, if you loan an amount of RM1mil, and you have deposit RM300k being parked in this account. The interest is calculated on the basis of RM700k and not RM1mil. The benefit is that you don't have to throw all the lump sum in.



 
 

if RM exchange rate with SG drop big time.. your interest saving dun cover your exchange lost.. .then how ?!?
 

Aniway.. not sure if MY has deposit insurance like SG.. if MY bank fail.. you may kiss your mil bye bye.. 
 

ha ha haha ..

Just bought a condo in jb for retirement, 90% loan from foreign bank. 

According to the banker, the minimum 1million requirement for foreigner property purchase will kick in after cny. She sounded confident about that.
 

I found out that this banker bought 3 units in the development I bought. That's how confident she is about the development n future property prices in jb.

afaik, there are so much land in iskandar area still not developed yet/in the pipeline. don't jump into one cos of 'encouragements', esp from agents.

do your research thoroughly. there are bound to be good ones to come.
 

also, be careful.. properties especially a mil and over are usually bought by foreigners.

perhaps a some handful of locals for speculations.
 

generic locals won't buy them... deemed too expensive.

just think how much they earn.. and in ringgit.
 

if this is for investments, likely you will take longer time to sell, and only sell to another foreigner (ie. the target market is much smaller).

Have heard of security guards in cahoot with robbers. They provide intel to the robbers as to who's who, and which units are vacant on weekdays. Esp those own by Singaporeans.

i actually tried THE HAND while shopping for a unit at horizon hills.. not the showroom but a couple of the developed precincts (to look-see).

the guards actually denied my entry.

tried some tricks trying to bluff my way in also could not. the guard eventually asked me to visit the showroom and get an agent to escort me in
 

so.. THE HAND don't always work..

You got to ask yourself why are you buying it? For own stay, retirement? Or for investment? If its for the latter, you got to have holding power. Good luck!
