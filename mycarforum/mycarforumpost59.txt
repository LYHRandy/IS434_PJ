Hello folks,
 

i know mcf a lot of gurus with rich expertise in wealth management, would like to seek some advice.
 

supposedly:
 

- 240k of loan, which will you go for? private or HDB? was told that private is as at 1.2% whileas HDB is at 2.6%.
 

- BTO, intend to sublet 2 units out as will be going malaysia for work. Any concern?
 

- the rental of 2 units will be used to fund the private loan installment.
 

- is it able to take more loan apart from the 240k? could use the extra for renovation and venture.
 
 

Due future, taking in as no CPF contribution.

Will come back once or twice a month.
 
 

please give your valuable thoughts, thanks

Some ppl may say go for the cheaper one because it is cheaper...question is cheaper for how long...if u r paying that amount within 5 yrs, i think it is ok to go to the bank to pay less interest plus I think they usually package w some freebies...HDB loan nothing...
 

If u r taking 10-20 yrs, take HDB no need to think so hard... u locked in the interest rate for the next 20 yrs why not...also not all can qualify for HDB loan....

I see, if i have cpf contribution, i would really settle for the loan. But due future, may not..

Hence every penny really matters.
 

I take into consideration, thanks.

This should be a no brainer. Bank's interest rate is floating. HDB's is fixed. Unless you are so certain banks will not increase interest to more than 4% throughout the loan tenure or you taking short loan, then go for the bank. Otherwise, the 2.6% will be fixed all the way.
 

You mean rental of 2 rooms right? Ask HDB. They normally allow if you have valid reasons such as overseas work commitments. What you do with the money you get from the rental is up to you. 
 

Taking more loan than the 240k is illegal. Don't try it. You can ask banks for renovation or personal loans.

actually i feel that the banks rate will not exceed that much due to the current global uncertainty.

again, this is my gut feeling, better don't risk it.
 

2.6 no doubt is higher but true, i can take 30 years loan.

it shouldn't be that taxing if i were to use the rental to fund the loan.
 

renovation or personal loans interest are high, i actually thought of asking for some loans..

i do have ready cash but keeping in the bank as they meant for other purposes..

The super upside of HDB loan is that loan can be reduced without penalty.  I borrowed $220k in 2004 for 20 yrs.  Have been diligent to pay down the principal with CPF.  Mortgage will end in 2014 or earlier.  Interest saving is btw $10k - $15k.

Give me , i would recommend private if you have a stable income and only need the loan for liquidity purposes, else i would prefer to recommend CPF . 
 

Reason is for any reason , if you lose your job and is unable to repay the amounts , you can adjust ur repayment lengths and another without any penalty. CPF also allows you to free up the cash as compared to you paying for private loan but in your case assuming if you don't have cpf contributions , it doesn't make much of a difference.
 

Anyway subletting , you have to report income for rental and i would seriously warn you of it , many kept quiet and hdb just kept quiet , it doesn't mean they don't know, just in case.
 

Things to take note :
 

1. Your returns on loan via rental : how much is your rental income ?
 

2. Your repayment period?
 

3. Assuming if you aren't able to find a tenant , how are you going to service the loan? Private loan , assuming if you aren't able to repay they take ur house. CPF , if you unable to repay , can talk to them they can do a deferred repayment. So think properly.

you mean the bank rates fluctuate every quarter? wow, if it stay this way and you are buying private, you would have made.

bro, well said.
in due future, i got zero cpf contribution and with my petite saving, i intend to use it for my business venture hence this is really untouchable..
 
in answering your qn:
1. 2 room rental is around $1200, i have checked. location is just beside MRT & bus interchange with amenities and school nearby.
 
2. payment period, i'm looking at 30 years. reason, if my venture don't do well, i could use the rental to support.
I will be renting out another room at my dad's place, which is my current room - $500.
 
3. yes, that's one of the factors that i'm considering too, new estate and with such high rental, it might actually dampen tenant. 
i did google, in the event of default, CPF is still willing to give allowance and grace.
 
Thank you.

anyway, good luck to your singlehood, all the best

i guess private is really for private purchase whereby you see the potential and makes.
not for me, this flat comes a long way for me and till date, it's never easy to obtain it.
hence, i will value it.

I took bank loan. 10yrs but loan amount about 60% of your loan amount. 
 

Let's use simple arithmetic, no inflation, compounding effect.
 

1) if you borrow 200k for 10 yrs - HDB 2.6%pa, you pay 26% so paid interest = $52k

2) if you borrow 200k for 10 yrs - Bank 1.2%pa, you pay 12% so paid interest = $24K

Then you save $28K.
 

The 1% interest ($2k) which you save every year is entitled to 2.5% interest if you leave it in CPF OA, 
 

If bank interest rates will really rise from 1.2% to 2.6% then you are still paying the same interest rates. But the saving in the previous year could have offset the interest earned should it exceed say from yr 5 onwards, if you have done the maths, i.e once it reached the rate will cause you to pay more than the accrued savings from the lower interest rate in the previous, then pay off the bank in full, which will have a penalty (just know when to cut you loss) so you have to input the penalty amount if you pay up in full before the tenure period.

Take HDB loan always.

Bank loans are just gimmicks, and at any point where you experience difficulties (you will never know in situations like nowadays),  to your house.

Sometimes it seems silly, but the most important things in buying a house are:

1) Security

2) Affordability

Anything else is very much secondary.
 

I agree with majority of others. When you have a choice, ALWAYS take HDB loan.

if you have a 'stable' job, by all means go for the risky bank loan cos in reality , you really do save ( The rich gets richer in singapore )
 

if you do not have CPF contribution coming thru and venturing on new biz, please do urself a favour , hdb loan. period .
 

Dont let the 2.6 what ever interest scare u la. A HDB in singapore will confirm be an appreciating asset (long term) . Come on, its the cheapest form of housing. 
 

Also, whatever cpf u use to finance the house, once u sell, all goes back to ur account , with interest .

bro, why not subletting the whole unit instead of just two rooms since you will be oversea? I know HDB grands permission to do that even before MOP if u are not staying in SG due to oversea commitment, or has the rule changed? do u have a place to stay for short period if u sublet the whole unit? That would fetch u double the rental income for your business up north.

Hello folks,
 

i know mcf a lot of gurus with rich expertise in wealth management, would like to seek some advice.
 

supposedly:
 

- 240k of loan, which will you go for? private or HDB? was told that private is as at 1.2% whileas HDB is at 2.6%.
 

- BTO, intend to sublet 2 units out as will be going malaysia for work. Any concern?
 

- the rental of 2 units will be used to fund the private loan installment.
 

- is it able to take more loan apart from the 240k? could use the extra for renovation and venture.
 
 

Due future, taking in as no CPF contribution.

Will come back once or twice a month.
 
 

please give your valuable thoughts, thanks



 

It is already page two and no one knows that HDB interest rate is also floating, i.e. 0.1% above CPF interest rate and also bank loan need 5% cash downpayment..

cannot, whole unit subletting is illegal, new units like BTO need 5 years of MOP. while as for room, there's no restriction, just need to inform HDB that you are doing it and pay the tax when due.
 

Yes, HDB do allow MOP to serve at later date but i would need a place to stay when i'm back.

go for bank loan.
 

let's say interest average interest rate to be 1.2% from 2013-2015, you already saved 4.2%.

assume average interest rate is 2.6% (same as HDB) from 2016-2018, no difference to you.

assume average interest rate to be 3.8% (1.2% more than HDB) from 2019-2021, you cough back whatever you've saved during the early years.
 

from the above scenario, note that:

1) the interest you have saved over the first 3 years could be re-invested or left in CPF to earn at least 2.5% interest.

2) money saved from 2013-2015 is bigger than interest coughed back from 2019-2021 ($2K today is only $1675 in 2019 based on 3% inflation rate).

3) you pay less interest in 2019-2021 as your loan amount would have reduced to approx $180K-$200K (assumed 30-year loan) compared to $240K today.
 

technically speaking, due to the ultra low interest rate environment we're in today, you will not really benefit from the 2.6% HDB loan until 10 years from now and you may have sold the place by then.
 

confirmed savings of $2K per annum today (monthly instalment of $794 vs $960) vs undetermined savings years later, the choice is clear for me.

It is jut a matter long sighted or short sighted . In view of the upcoming years , interest rates will never be kept low , there is already signs that US might need to hike interest rates in the upcoming years , this so called low interest rate you are paying now isn't going to stay for very long. So it is your own choice.
 

Given CPF's way of repayment assuming if TS makes money from his business venture , he can do an early repayment without any penalty . The same cannot be said of a private loan. Above that , you are putting yourself at risk by taking a variable interest loan , can you guarantee that we will see those lower interest for 30 years?

I disagree with some of your illustration above.  

1. Interest income from CPF will not be able to offset interest expense to bank loan.  O/s bank loan will always be bigger than CPF balance.  If CPF balance as big as bank loan, why need to borrow?

2. For HDB loan, the outstanding balance can be reduced as & when 1 has excess $$.  For bank loan, you can only do it whenever you switch.  The interest saving from lump sum payment is huge especially in the early days of mortgage.

Bank loan for a short term 1.. (<10 yrs)
 

Definitely HDB loan if you are paying through your teeth aldy and in situations whereby a large % of your monthly pay needs to go to the hse + >20 yrs loan.
 

Anything happen can go find your MP for HDB loan arrears.  
 

But for Private, if anything happen, shld be no give chance 1. (unless u got some other assets)

agree on the long term risk if TS is someone who plans to hold onto the property for 30 years. unfortunately, most people don't. not even 15 years.
 

most bank loan allows partial repayment without any penalty down to 25/50% of loan amount during lock-in period which is good enough for most people. if TS is able to repay up to $120K or more within 2 years, he probably don't need a loan. most people like to ask what if they strike lottery? my answer would be to speak to any financial adviser, there are plenty of ways to earn more than 1.2% annual return than to repay mortgage loan.
 

once out of lock-in period, TS could repay anytime and any amount he wants.
 

anyway, it's good to have diversified views so TS could see which is closer to his risk profile.

I disagree with some of your illustration above.  

1. Interest income from CPF will not be able to offset interest expense to bank loan.  O/s bank loan will always be bigger than CPF balance.  If CPF balance as big as bank loan, why need to borrow?

2. For HDB loan, the outstanding balance can be reduced as & when 1 has excess $$.  For bank loan, you can only do it whenever you switch.  The interest saving from lump sum payment is huge especially in the early days of mortgage.



 

maybe i wasn't clear enough with my example. monthly instalment for private loan of $240K over 30 years at 1.2% is $794. HDB loan at 2.6% is $960. assume TS has $960 in CPF to pay the instalment, instead of deducting $960 from CPF OA account, there will be surplus of $166 per month which will enjoy the 2.5% CPF interest rate.
 

there are many people who have more than enough CPF to fully pay off their property but choose to keep the CPF in OA account since it's earning higher interest (2.5% vs 1.2%). one could also re-invest 30% of the OA money into other instruments e.g. REITs, dividend stocks for higher returns.
 

here's my favourite example of an owner who can pay in full but choose not to.

mark zuckerberg took loan for $5M bungalow
 

as for partial repayment without penalty, that is becoming common with many banks. if it's absent for the offer letter, just ask for it.

i agreed, cannot take business venture into consideration. it's 50/50 chances..




It's not even 50/50, more like 10/90 . Serious.

i'm the TS  
 

question: the monthly CPF contribution can be paid for bank loan? I thought borrowing from bank, you need to pay back in hard cash?
 

2. if CPF contribution can be used, it would really be ideal. But in my scenario, i can't as i won't have anymore CPF contribution when stop working.
 

3. as of now, i only got 60k in my cpf, 20k lying in investment ac after selling some stocks (if i'm not going to use it, likely the money will return back to CPF), 20k lying in unit trust but in red.
 

The rest, i don't really know how to answer. thanks

Yes, you can pay bank using CPF.  No question about that.  But upfront you have to pay 5% cash.
 

You can go around it by using your cpf to buy shares now, then after the house has been bought, then sell the shares, and when the money goes back to your ordinary account, use it to pay monthly instalment.  this is a loop hole everybody knows.

You are very clear on your example.  You are looking from monthly installment only whereby i am illustrating the interest income from CPF vs interest expense on outstanding mortgage.  For 1st 5 yrs, the outstanding liability will be substantially higher than CPF (all accounts).  The interest expense will be substantially higher than interest income.  The only way to reduce interest expense over the tenure is to make partial redemption.
 

The only reason Mark still borrowing $$ is likely could be due to tax reason.

Dude , i assume you have not read in depth to understand his constants. This guy is intending to take some risk to start up his own business and with all businesses there are risks involved. I would probably presume he doesn't intend to have any income assuming he is doesn't do well.
 

In this case , any stupid investments elsewhere would only increase the amounts of interest he actually needs to pay. Yes , setting aside some money in stocks using cpf is good for a just in case measure but in fact why would one do so if he is so sure that he has enough money to pay off ? 
 

The issue here is the uncertainty that he is in and it isn't wise for you to blatantly advice him to take unnecessary risk , the problem is , with him speaking to any financial advisors , they would probably be more keen to sell him a loan than to advice him to take a cpf loan. Why i know coz i work in a bank.
 

By the way don't give me those math equations , i know as much if not more than you how this is being counted. Here i quote , you mention 1.2% over 30 years , now is this GUARANTEED? Do remember i am bolding this , i will take note what you say. For CPF ,it is more or less the same the past 1 or 2 decades , basically a difference of 0.1% above what they are paying to cpf holders.
 

In actual fact, the special account actually pays 4% , why don't you suggest borrowing from the bank and putting it to Special account and over 30 years you probably earn back the difference? The issue is bank rates varies from time to time.
 

I don't even need to take the back records to tell you , it is only in the recent years where interest rates has dropped, even 5 years ago , we are seeing rates above 2.7% so assuming if one only gains 2 years of 1% discount  and to be short changed on the remaining years , would he end up paying more?
 

I am not sure if you are in advisory biz but since you mentioned banks i am assuming you are quite close or savvy , and it seems clearly you are posting something very misleading here.

we could be looking at different side of the coin but i suppose we both agree that the outstanding liability is highest in the early years of the loan.
 

to better illustrate my point. below are some values taken off a typical amortization table:

1) bank loan @ 1.2%, monthly instalment of $794

on first month of loan, $240 goes to interest and $554 goes towards principal loan amount of $240K

36 months later, outstanding balance with bank is $219,696
 

2) HDB loan @ 2.6%, monthly instalment of $960

on first month of loan, $520 goes to interest and $440 goes towards principal loan amount of $240K

36 months later, outstanding balance with HDB is $223,989
 

Savings from interest is $4293 excluding any other interest earned from bank/CPF OA.

In the event in which TS fails his biz. (ZERO income) 
 
 

to better illustrate my point. below are some values taken off a typical amortization table:

1) bank loan @ 1.2%, monthly instalment of $794

on first month of loan, $240 goes to interest and $554 goes towards principal loan amount of $240K

36 months later, outstanding balance with bank is $219,696
 

Bank takes his house , sells it irregardless profit or loss , slaps the remaining amount inclusive of interest , they are supposed to get.
 
 

2) HDB loan @ 2.6%, monthly instalment of $960

on first month of loan, $520 goes to interest and $440 goes towards principal loan amount of $240K

36 months later, outstanding balance with HDB is $223,989
 

Savings from interest is $4293 excluding any other interest earned from bank/CPF OA.
 



You basically can talk to HDB for a deferred payment of up for quite a long time before they take back , and during which assuming if they take back , they would not charge you interest on the the remaining balance. 
 

Given current price inflation and the initial down payments he has given , he probably doesn't need to pay anything back and in fact probably has some balance left if i am not wrong based on his cpf amounts<- i need someone to confirm this i am not very sure about this side.

in my earlier example i have made an assumption that interest rate could be at 3.8% few years down the road so it is not my intention to mislead anyone into thinking that 1.2% will last forever. i'm sure TS knows that the majority is for HDB so i'm just offering an alternative view based on my personal experience and the course of my work.

I think let's look at it from another angle as well. If the TS is planning to hold onto the property for a long time i.e 30 years or more I would say hdb loan as the rate is pegged to the cpf even if it's 2.6%. But if he is planning to sell the property in for example 5 years (he is a risk taker and businessman after all), then a bank loan would be smarter. If it's longer than that, there's always the option of going down the home refinance route. So i think it really depends on what intentions he has for the property and how much risk he is willing to take.

want future flexibility of early or partial redemption at a higher rate now---> HDB
 

want lower rates now but no flexibility of early/partial redemption and rates possibly moving higher in future ----> private
 

correct me if I am wrong but for private loan even if don't pay, i think bank cannot repossess because it is a HDB flat?

Only if there are other owners . Assuming if sole owner , foreclosure is possible.

thank you for your valuable inputs, i'm really appreciative and grateful.
 

Yes, my future is uncertain as i wish to venture something of my own, pursue my dream.

even with the saving i got, as much as possible, i hope to use it for my venture.
 

no doubt the bank offer very low interest rate, i'm really tempted thats provided i'm still working.

along with my partner, we will have more than 2k of CPF contribution which can be used to pay off the bank loan.

Along with the rental from the room, it sure looks even attractive.
 

However, not in my scenario.

Both of us are leaving our jobs to pursue a dream, whether will succeed or fail, it still early to tell.

hence the backup plan will be renting out our 2 rooms which will probably fetch $1.2k

along with my current room as at $500.
 

The rental will be use to pay off HDB loan, hopefully if there's any excess, it will be used as cushion if the worst event.
 

I'm the only son, my parent's flat has been fully paid up years back but i don't wish to take this as a consideration.
 

Since you have mentioned that it's wise to utilize my 20k in CPF investment account, after the payment of flat has been made, i could sell back the stock and regain my 20k, this 20k will act as a buffer for me.

correct me if i'm wrong, this 20k of CPF will ease me for the next 16mths where as i still getting income from the 3 rooms rental.
 

Now, the problem is: what to buy.. any recommendation for low risk stocks..

maybe you should explore renting out the whole unit since you are not staying in singapore, and not rent out your existing room at your dad's place. I wouldn't want my dad to deal with strangers and the trouble of managing tenant, seriously!

Hello folks,
 

i know mcf a lot of gurus with rich expertise in wealth management, would like to seek some advice.
 

supposedly:
 

- 240k of loan, which will you go for? private or HDB? was told that private is as at 1.2% whileas HDB is at 2.6%.
 

- BTO, intend to sublet 2 units out as will be going malaysia for work. Any concern?
 

- the rental of 2 units will be used to fund the private loan installment.
 

- is it able to take more loan apart from the 240k? could use the extra for renovation and venture.
 
 

Due future, taking in as no CPF contribution.

Will come back once or twice a month.
 
 

please give your valuable thoughts, thanks



 

many people here give you very insightful answer, but there is a question you need to ask yourself too. Do you intend to upgrade (have the aspiration and financial ability etc you know best) to a private property after MOP?? (3 yrs for resale and 5 yrs for brand new).
 

If answer is strong yes I would think bank loan better   cause interests lower and you are not gonna hold this HDB long term or forever.

Bro you are very brave. 

Applaud you. 
 

My view is this. 

For your case, just take the HDB loan. 

You cannot afford volatility, since you are taking already considerable financial risk to start a biz.

95% of new bizness fail within 5 years, but those that make it will get high returns. 
 

You are right to say that you should not invest the 20k. 

You should not be risking anything investing right now.

Hmm....suggest u consider HDB loan in the event your venture does not perform to expectations after a stipulated period that you think you will sustain it. At least, you are free of this one burden besides worrying about business overheads and even whether your income will be stable for a period of time. 
 

Take the 2.6% as cost for peace of mind. In the event that things worked out very well and you can be confident that it will be able to sustain itself without the housing loan burden, then u can switch to a lower bank rate (if it's still lower, like current rates or comfortable for your calculator). 
 

Boils down to what is within your means....will not tikam tikam on future as most crystal balls not very accurate these days.
 

Hope you able to make the calculator work for you....go with peace, it's afterall a first own roof.
 
 

Safe ride and good luck in your new venture.

Cheers

maybe i wasn't clear enough with my example. monthly instalment for private loan of $240K over 30 years at 1.2% is $794. HDB loan at 2.6% is $960. assume TS has $960 in CPF to pay the instalment, instead of deducting $960 from CPF OA account, there will be surplus of $166 per month which will enjoy the 2.5% CPF interest rate.
 

there are many people who have more than enough CPF to fully pay off their property but choose to keep the CPF in OA account since it's earning higher interest (2.5% vs 1.2%). one could also re-invest 30% of the OA money into other instruments e.g. REITs, dividend stocks for higher returns.
 

here's my favourite example of an owner who can pay in full but choose not to.

mark zuckerberg took loan for $5M bungalow
 

as for partial repayment without penalty, that is becoming common with many banks. if it's absent for the offer letter, just ask for it.



 

Bro, your numbers make total sense, but CPF i don't take as cash. 

CPF is 'sub-cash' for me. 

Cos there are so many regulations about withdrawal etc. 

Not sure what the regulations are by the time i can withdraw. 
 

The only thing that is real, is cash in my account. 

As far as i am concerned, I am using my wife and my CPF to pay down my last existing houseing loan. 

You might say i am stupid, but I am actually fully paying off my last existing housing loan with CPF + a smaller amount of cash in a few months. 
 

Simple reason being, my next (first) housing loan can take 80% loan. Total capital outlay will actually be smaller than the new additional tax.

Bro you are very brave. 

Applaud you. 
 

My view is this. 

For your case, just take the HDB loan. 

You cannot afford volatility, since you are taking already considerable financial risk to start a biz.

95% of new bizness fail within 5 years, but those that make it will get high returns. 
 

You are right to say that you should not invest the 20k. 

You should not be risking anything investing right now.



 

you flatter me, i just had this dream.. since i got it, might as well i try it since i'm still young.
 

we gave ourselves 2 yrs time, of course, anytime that venture is not responding, we will return to SG and working off our asses..  
 


Since you have mentioned that it's wise to utilize my 20k in CPF investment account, after the payment of flat has been made, i could sell back the stock and regain my 20k, this 20k will act as a buffer for me.
correct me if i'm wrong, this 20k of CPF will ease me for the next 16mths where as i still getting income from the 3 rooms rental.

 

you misread my intention:
 

i feel that i should invest the 20k in the investment account , otherwise the money will return back to CPF account. upon taking the key, the whole OA & SA will be wipe out.

I have checked with the investment bank, if there's no activity, the fund will return to CPF after 2 month.

My last date is 27th of March despite i sold it during profit in early Jan 2013.
 

Hence before HDB do so, i should buy a low risk stock to utilize this 20k. And once my CPF is wiped out, i will sell the stock and credit the money back to my CPF whereby it will be used for loan.

Then the rental from 2 rooms will provide hard cash for the next 16mths too.
 

am i painting a glossy picture? could anyone please help me out if this is foolproof.

bro, totally understand your point as to fork out 25% cash and 25% CPF for 2nd property is no joke. they don't have such cooling measures in US else mark zuckerberg may have done the same

The 20k is to remove it so HDB doesn't wipe the account clean.
 

Right now that's a good move as he will have some buffer to tide over the HDB loan repayments. 
 

In fact, anything over the minimum sum required in cpf should be diverted to other investments(except those insurance linked investments) before flat payment.

More or less. 
 

You'll be paying more interest in the long run and you have to weigh that against the buffer time that you will get. 
 

Since you are starting off a new biz, then I would venture to say that this would be the right move as buffer time in biz esp during start up is more

important than the little additional interest you would save on that. And you can always re-finance your loan after. 
 

I would also suggest to put aside a portion of your passive income from rents in cash as backup to the loan or other emergencies/opportunities.

In the event you passed away before the loan is fully paid, the insurance that comes with HDB loan will take care of the rest of the loan amount.

If you are paying your loan using CPF OA account, then you no need to worry as you will be in HPS scheme.

If you paying cash for loan, then see how much death coverage with respect to your loan. If death coverage is not enough to cover for housing loan, up your death coverage to at least match the loan you taking.

thanks. Cfm will take loan from CPF OA... then I will have 2 more ques:
- Is there a cap where the HPS scheme will cover? what is the amount insured under HPS? 
- If my daughter is not the co-owner (me divorce), will this HPS scheme still cover?

HPS is by percentages. Up to 100% of loan amount. 
 
It's very affordable and absolutely necessary. 
 
As a single with Dg. U need to check with the lawyers. But i believe that 100% will go to your daughter.
If u were not divorced, standard is spouse 50%, children 50% of your inheritance.
Best to make a will. List whoever (grandparents) as guardians etc. Custodian of your dg's financial matters etc. Lasting Power of Attorney is also equally important. 
 
Yes and check with HDB point by point!

I think I'm correct to assume that if you pass away in the next 5 years, your daughter is still below age 21?
 
Assuming you have HDB's HPS.. And no more outstanding loan bec HPS payout. Officially the flat should go to your daughter but better check with HDB if under 21 can have the name inside.

Of cos HDB loan in the long run as our loan period usually more than 10 yrs. Eg. I can only take bank loan as i am not married when i bought my flat in 2003. Total loan amount 110k from bank. After repaying the loan for 11 yrs. Still owe them 68k. Meaning i only paid 42k + bank interest in these 11 long yrs. This shows how high the bank interest are!!!!

If i remember correctly at that time, my 1st year was 1.5%, 2nd yr was 1.8% and 3rd yr was 2%. After 3rd yr was market rate liao. Till now is about 5.5% for many yrs liao. I can't do a re-finance loan as my loan amount was less than 100k. No bank wanna do. They say it's a waste of their time.

Still with same bank after 11 years? Did you refinance with the bank or you are at their max rate of 3.75% now? HDB loan minimum amount to refinance is 50k. Anyway you never apply to HDB  loan back? 2.6%.. Seriously I really don't understand why cannot refinance within same bank.. Last time I wotk in local bank, got do refinance for customer as long as long is above 50k.. Maybe not be the 1% rate.. But it's the 2% rate.. Still better than the 3% or 5% rate. It's your money bro... If you don't do your homework over your own loan & money.... Then it's you paying more $$.... If you open bank, a customer quietly always paying high interest... You will be very happy right?

Some ppl may say go for the cheaper one because it is cheaper...question is cheaper for how long...if u r paying that amount within 5 yrs, i think it is ok to go to the bank to pay less interest plus I think they usually package w some freebies...HDB loan nothing...
 
If u r taking 10-20 yrs, take HDB no need to think so hard... u locked in the interest rate for the next 20 yrs why not...also not all can qualify for HDB loan....

 
I beg to differ... that depends how long you intend to stay in HDB or own it.
 
eg. last 10 years people whom own and have sold within 2005 to 2014 are suckers if they use HDB because they have sold their flat within this period would be better off using bank loan.
 
but if you intend to stay there or own it forever? HDB maybe better peace of mind but not necessary better cause 20 years to 30 years many things can happen and financial goal, vision and dreams can change.
 
ask yourself this question? since 2005 how much have change in your personal income and net worth? then since 2009 last  5 years how much changes??
 
if a considerable or notceable changes, this can be a guide 20 years to 30 years things can change a lot too. 
 
afterall no right no wrong, read all advise and apply yourself cause different people different situation, no one loan fit all

Last time when I was working in consumer bank, got a auntie customer who is 56 years old walk into bank and complain that the bank has been charging her 5.75% interest for her EC. Now she is 56 year old, she cannot use her CPFOA to pay for housing loan despite having 80+k in account and her outstanding loan is 40+k.. 
 
she blames the bank for not informing her that CPF will merge her OA with SA when she is 55 and she is not allow to pay with her OA. 
 
She threatens to go to press to complain if the bank don't allow her to use her CPFOA to continue paying for her monthly instalments, and demands that's the bank refund all the years of higher interest of 5.75% charged..
 
I smiled at her and ask her if she has received letters from the bank over the past years? She said yes. I ask her if she noticed that the interest has been 5.75%? She said yes. I asked her if she knows that she is turning 55 years old.. she said yes..
 
Then I tell her if years ago she has contacted the bank to refinance her property, don't see why it can't be done. And also bank can't keep track if customers turning 55 and will inform cpf changes.. how to? If cpf members don't take charge of their $, how bank take charge? 
 
If they know they are paying high interest and choose to do nothing, usually bec they are well to do.. then any organisations can't automatically tell their customers please don't continue doiing so... Sekali customer complain why bank so kpo.

5.5% is brutal. Thats the thing bout rates unfixed, they start low, by they will increase high up as urely as deth & ticks.Taking unfix, u need to monitor closely. The moment u smell something amiss, u need to make changes accordingly....loan hoping just like job hopping.But even if u are going to hop around, look at the T & Cs. There early redemption fee, etc etc. So u must know where the threshold is.If its going take into account a % of the outstanding, then its going to hurt. Pls scrutinise the T & Cs in dept.

Thanks for advise. I will check will HDB whether i can take their 2.6% loan. Current loan left 9 yrs with UOB bank and left 68K only. I remembered asking banks about re-financing a fews yrs back (Maybank and POSB) they told me i can't do a re-financing cos my loan amount at that time was less than 100K.

The problem with our home loan market is there is no long dated debt mkt that facilitates issuance of long term housing loan with fixed rates. 
 
So even if you smell something amiss, assuming you are not under any loan lock in period, you'll only be able to refinance for 3 yrs or thereabouts, after that you will be exposed to the new interest rate environment.

Thats exactly right.
 
When you are buying a property and they can only guarantee you 3 years fixed rate 
 
what happens if in 3 years time rates hit 6 or 7%?
 
Its a silly system.

Then I tell her if years ago she has contacted the bank to refinance her property, don't see why it can't be done. And also bank can't keep track if customers turning 55 and will inform cpf changes.. how to? If cpf members don't take charge of their $, how bank take charge?
 
If they know they are paying high interest and choose to do nothing, usually bec they are well to do.. then any organisations can't automatically tell their customers please don't continue doiing so... Sekali customer complain why bank so kpo.

 
i thot that if you have met the minimum sum, you can use the excess to pay for house?

I think the problem is people wanting to take small loans of
 
less than 100k and banks are inflexible.
 
Poeple should big big loans and then banks are
 
friendly and more helpful to people.
 
Banks don't want you to borrow a small amount
 
they want you to borrow a big amount.

true bec for refinance to another bank, they want to do at least 100k loan.. But if re price within same bank, they are willing to do it for perhaps SIBOR+1.5-2% spread for an admin fee of $200-$500.. Even for loans that are below 100k, and above 50k. 
Too many people are not taking charge of their own $, or they are asking the wrong people for advise.

How do you gather that he made 50k? Without the specifics, you can't conclude that the flat he sold is equal to the bto he is now buying.
 
Knowing the resale prices vs bto prices, I am not disputing that he made money - just asking how you concluded that the profit is 50k.

If he sells his 200k flat for 400k, he definitely make 200k less incidental cost like legal fee and stamp fee in the first purchase as well as agent fee for the sale.
 
The next bto flat that he buys at 350k, if about same size, his gain is reduced to 50k less charges mentioned above, though he gets a new lease. Factor in the sale levy, legal fee and stamp fee and renovation cost for the second bto, he may not make at all.

No la, hahaha hdb is for normal citizen like many of us here to have a roof over head.
 
We bought a 4rm bto at that time, 100+ so with interest let's put it easy 200k
 
Then we tot of either a smaller EC or bigger 5rm. Space is scarce in our island n cheaper so I op for a bto 5 room that costs below 350
 
I sold below 500, so minus the agent, resale levy, fees, etc got a bit for Reno I'm happy.
 
Simply put it, foc upgrade ba and not to forgot my current estate got quite afew defects eg the bathroom
So I hate dust n any rework done to my place so I got rid of it instead since timing is ripe.

2.6% is not the cap. It's the base rate. When average of savings and FD rate rise above 2.5%, HDB loan rate will follow.
 
In the last 8 years, sibor has been much lower than HDB loan rate. Even with the recent spike in sibor, it is still lower.

I think you conveniently left out the fact that HDB interest rate is 0.1% above cpf rates which historically, taking aside this period of low interest rate environment, is lower than the rates from banks. Even if HDB rates does spike, it will mean than the cpf rates have spiked and banks' rates would be way higher than that. Also HDB rates are known to be stable which is exactly what you want when talking about long term financing such as a mortgage loan. Banks can easily up their rates with sibor or spread increases and all you get is a 3 month notice to react.

Think it is also tag to the interest rate CPF paying to the people. If they raise the interest rate for hdb housing loan, the corresponding CPF interest will have to follow as well. Think it is pegged at 0.1% higher than prevailing CPF interest. I guess even if it moves higher, the quantum will be sub less than the private loan.

I only want to dispel his notion that HDB loan rate is CAPPED at 2.6%. It is the BASE rate as it is tagged at 0.1% above CPF OA rate which has a statutory min rate of 2.5%. In other words, HDB loan rate cannot be lower than 2.6%.
 
HDB loan rate is dependent on CPF OA rate. CPF OA rate can only go up when the average savings and FD rates go up above 2.5%. This has not happened in the last few years and it is unlikely to happen in the next few years. In this sense, borrowers will feel secured knowing the rate is not volatile by paying a premium.
 
Though I mentioned that sibor has been low in the last 8 years and indirectly commercial loan rate is much lower than HDB loan rate, it doesn’t mean it will be lower for the next few years. But it is a fact that those who took commercial loan, benefitted all this long especially when the quantum of loan is highest in the initial few years of the loan.

When it comes to HDB loan, rate is not the only thing to look at
 
it is also impt that for HDB loan, there is less stress when the sole breadwinner is suddenly retrenched and unable to service the loan
 
at least he would know that HDB will not kick his family out on the streets 
 
And if he wish to repay the principal, i don't think HDB will charge a early repayment penalty right?

Hi folks,
 
I have question regarding housing loan from bank.
 
I am currently staying in flat A which has almost been fully paid by mostly CPF (and some cash).    My CPF account is almost empty at this point of time, as almost all my CPF monies are in Flat A.
 
I intend to buy a flat B (of a smaller value), and intend to pay for Flat B using CPF.  However, I need to sell Flat A in order to free up the CPF first.
 
If I were to pay full cash now for Flat B, I will be CPF-rich but cash-poor by the time Flat A has been sold.  For my case, Flat A can only be sold (within 6 months) after Flat B has been purchased.
 
I am thinking of creating a buffer by taking a short term loan (e.g. 6 months, $200k) from bank.  So that by the time my CPF becomes available (after selling Flat A), I can immediately pay the bank with one lump sum CPF, without incurring too much interest.
 
Would this arrangement work?  Is there any minimum loan period and would there be any penalty if one redeems the loan too early?  I know car loan has.
 
Many thanks.

either try bridging loan or get the agent to coordinate the timing of the contra sales (or extend the stay in flat A with the new owner).

Hi,
 
been thinking if I should consider switching to a bank to pay off my housing loan?
 
Current income for my wife and I, are pretty healthy and regular.
 
Paying around $1100 monthly to HDB whereby half of the payment goes to the interest.
 
Been doing this for the last 3 years.
Whats your view?
Switch or remain?
 
My goal is to stay debt free, the earlier I can pay off the loan, I could probably invest in a condo?
or shift out from Singapore and sell beancurd in Ipoh?

For HDB loan, you can always do partial redemption as & when u like.
 
I pay off HDB loan within 10 yrs with biannual partial redemption using CPF.

what do you mean by partial redemption?
 
early payment?
for example, excess in O.A, use it and pay off the loan?
 
in my scenario, I don't earn much..
hence my O.A probably got less than 5 digit..

Every 2 years, we will have excess in OA.  We will use almost entire OA (have to leave 1 mth installment in OA) to pay down the loan.

Makes negligible difference. Was advised by HDB opicer to let the loan drag on. Anyway, I still redeem my loan with my CPF "surplus" 'cos I can't see the naggy monthly transactions.

There is a difference during 1st 10 yrs of the loan tenure.  More repayment is used to service interest rather than principal.
 
Wasn't there a dbs loan where they promise that their interest will ALWAYS be lower than HDB for 10 years?
 
Pure marketing BS lah.
 
For the past 20 yrs, SIBOR got higher than CPF interest rate meh?

my same sentiment, hence was thinking of switching to bank loan instead.
 
Should I?
 
Do be frank, we don't have much in OA. Mainly use as a backup of 6 months payment.
Hence, may not be able to follow what you did

Do your sum.
 
During that 10 yrs, i make sure i always have a job to service loan.  Now, it is not my consideration anymore.

its my first hdb..
 
not that I enjoy switching, just that the amount we are paying, goes to the interest instead of the principal..
 
excess, very little..

even you switch to private bank loan
the amount you pay every month also service the interest more than paying down the principal
that's normal for all home loan ... no?

A 300K loan at 2.6% interest rate, 25 years: First month $711 repay principal, $650 interest; 121st month (10 years), $922 repay principal, $439 interest.
 
The same assuming there is flat bank interest rate of 1.6% throughout: First month $814 repay principal, $400 interest; 121st month (10 years), $955 repay principal, $259 interest.
 
However, once switch to bank interest cannot go back to CPF IIRC. There is also the probability of bank interest rate going higher than 3% later, but no one knows how long later...
 
Another thing is HDB can probably negotiate longer if run into repayment problems, but banks should act much faster: my opinion only.
 
 
 
 

even you switch to private bank loan
the amount you pay every month also service the interest more than paying down the principal

last instalment ... 
 
anyway, the funny thing was i approached HDB to do a lump sum repayment 2 years ago .... only a few thousands mah ... but they told me that to do so, i would be required to pay a portion in CASH !!?? so i told the lady at the counter to forget my request and continue to slowly deduct from my CPF instead.
 
also asked them for an auth letter to do the final deduction of the conveyance and stamp fees from my CPF as well.

But the accrued interests charged by CPF will continue to grow month by month. If you are not selling off your flat, then you may have a shock later on how much your money will need to be trapped in CPF after you sell it off due to the requirement to repay the CPF main + accrued interest back into your CPF account and ultimately into your retirement account which is a trapped fund anyway.
The question is how do I pay back CPF sum so that the accrued interest charged may stop and I can start building up retirement funds in cash in my bank?

depends how much interest you accrue lor ...
 
in my case, I think should be able to cover everything ... I used CPF 155k to buy my resale 3 rm 11 years ago.
 
so I est my CPF interest should be about 45k ... but if I sell my flat now, should be in the region of 280k.
 
so 300 - 155 - 45 = 80k balance ? or is my calculation off ?
 
anyway, I have no intention to sell also ... the location is what I want.

Yes. But your CPF accrued interest will still rise every month. So unless your flat rises in value the same way, your 80K balance will get lesser every year too since the amount you sell will have to go back to your CPF and the accrued interest.

Actually not cheem, just something a lot of Singaporeans has not noticed.
When we used CPF to pay for our housing, we got to put back(I dun use pay back) the amount + accrued interest back to CPF when we sell.
Even if we pay off the house loan using CPF, as long the amount that you use from CPF is not put back, this accrued interest will keep on increasing (2.5% per year) and finally when you sell off your flat for retirement, you find that the amount that you need to put back into CPF becomes so big that you dun get a lot of cash back in your hands.

The accruing will take place all the way until you set aside for actual retirement account.
 
IIRC, at that point, whatever accrued won't really matter.

why do you need to sell off your flat for retirement?
 
then where are you going to stay for retirement?

sure or not, BFF.
I'm not very savvy with all these..
teach me a little.
 
I only know that I still had a debt of 218k with HDB over 27 years..
both my wife and I, our income are average and consider stable.
*hopefully*
 
I know the moment once we step out from HDB loan, we can't return.
Was told that banks are not that kind when comes to late payment.
 
although the interest is 1.48% etc, I notice there are costs such as legals, valuation etc.
probably will cost another 1.6k via cpf and $300 via cash.
each time, will incur these costs if I were to do refinancing..
hence it may not seem to be a good deal afterall.

You should save up and create a buffer first (either in CPF or cash). 1 year of monthly installments should be considered quite safe already. I suggest you do a spreadsheet to calculate the expected savings over the 28 years.
 
By the way, don't you work in a SY? I hardly consider that stable.

It's basically a balance between low risk (with guaranteed rates with a higher current premium) versus high risk (variable rates with lower (temporary?) rates).
 
Low risk low gain, high risk high gains.
 
Check your finances carefully to see if you can stomach or handle the risk.

yeah, good point there.
 
our current saving in cpf is at most, 6 months only..
I guess its not advisable, should save until a year to cushion the uncertainty.
 
I did a random check with my colleagues and friends, it seems a lot are still on hdb loan instead.
no doubt, there's saving but everyone is concern about the uncertainty.

Just to calculate:
 
For the first 3 years, the interest paid for 2.6%, 27 years, 218K ranges from $435-472.
 
For the first 3 years, the interest paid for 1.48%, 27 years, 218K ranges from $244-269.
 
The interest savings per month is $191 to 203 which represents for 3 years a sum of just over $7,000.
 
Against this benchmark, you can measure if the differences and the risk taken warrant the switch.
 

yeah, good point there.

its very simple, its all based on luck.
 
Some people take HDB and pay 2.6% sleep soundly at night cos 
so far HDB never go above 2.6%. Although in theory it can.
 
Some people give up HDB loan and loan from bank and over the last
10 year pay below 2.6%. Every night sleep happy cos save so much on interest.
 
If you compare 0.95% vs 2.6% over 30 years you will save thousands.
 
But if you are unlucky and come out of HDB and bank loan goes above 2.6%
and worse still lose job and cannot pay installments and bank foreclose so now
no home and still have to pay bank losses that's the worse.
 
So HDB 2.6% high but safe or bank loan low but risky depends on a person
risk appetite and luck.
 
Good luck
