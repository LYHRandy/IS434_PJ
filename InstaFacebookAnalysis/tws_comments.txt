Can’t deny that CPF is great, but CPF does have its negative downsides as well. It’s a well known fact that Singapore birth rate has declined significantly over the years, hence the number of people to replace the current working class has decreased. With decreasing working class, number of people being subjected to CPF decreases as well. Hence, eventually CPF will (a) run out of money (b) increase the contribution percentage. Singapore is trying its best to gather more people by allow foreigners to migrate over in hopes that it will convince them to stay and be subjected to CPF and taxes. But has it been that case? Most people who takes up citizenship eventually returns to their country, hence further complicating the CPF and tax situation. Another issue is that millennials are taking up more freelance jobs, which are not required to contribute to CPF (grab food, grab driver, designers, event coordinators, etc) this also contributes to the issue of decrease in money within CPF. The only way around that specific issue is (a) government enforces everyone to contribute (b) continue to struggle finding funds for CPF. All these are pointers should be pointed out about CPF before completely trusting CPF. While, I highly doubt that funds within CPF will ever run out but it’s to our best interest to keep in mind that many things are going to change drastically in the years to come.

❤️
@shawn_term_memory 😆😆 what do you think of this.
Another hot tip: Follow @themilelion for travel hacking advice 😎
@ekxuanwen I’m interested to know, do you think we should splurge or save more during holiday trips? Guilty to admit, but I’m more for the former since I’ll specifically plan my savings to enjoy a holiday 👉🏻👈🏻

The intent of this piece and artwork are great. But this applies to only a minority. Truth is, many people have no choice but to work long hours from civil servants to taxi drivers to cleaners. Its just the way our society is. So we cant simply say we can work less and therefore we have time for family. No work then no money

47 years old, that is a bit early. Most people should live till 55, and anything more than that is a gift.
Brilliant! So good. 👏🏻

The saddest thing is many young couples may want to save money and have more intimate events, but they get guilted and pressured by parents into organising bigger, grander, noisier but ultimately hollower weddings. All so the parents can show off to compete with their other relatives or friends. Hope more go down the route of what you described, a lot of these so-called tradition must haves are pointless and take up a lot of money we don't have.

Do you guys think that universal basic income would mean a happier society?
Money cannot buy happiness. But it sure can buy you things and experiences that makes you happy!!
Being content with little is a selfish way of thinking especially when one has dependents.
I’ve seen this before, but was still awesome to go through it again. Thank you for the reminder.

@adeadrixian
@jason_jer188 check out this page, it's the one I've been telling you about they post a lot of good things and discussions about finances 🤙

Did your dad also *expect *you to give him a portion of whatever you earned?
Hello, I found this shared by a friend. Really love this and your other post. Thanks for these and look forward to more stories 👏🏻
I also believe in this strongly. I would rather rely on myself to make my own fortune than rely on parents. That said, the mindset that the wealthy have about money is the one that helps them to make more money and having the right connections helps. A lot. So having wealthy parents who can help you to make even more money helps tremendously. Due to poverty, my parents tend to spend all whatever they have some money (strike 4D, for example) and have no proper financial planning and management. When my father got hospitalised that's when everything gone to shit. I'm glad that tough period is over and I've learnt and grew up a lot from it.

So true! Not gonna leave too much for my only kid. He needs to have something to work for or he may just float through life like a bum.
100k by 30? thats a realistic goal! how much for financial independence....?
didn’t know i needed this man thanks for sharing!
@whypiewhy yes!
Nice story! Thank you for sharing
But I inherited debts... Its not nothing
I think it’s great your dad taught you financial independence, though wouldn’t it have been nice to have a leg up like the other rich kids so you get a headstart?

Gotta wonder, you mention Singapore Savings Bonds a lot. Is this something you would recommend world-wide or is it better to seek out the benefits of bonds from our own countries? I'm still learning about bonds in general mind you.

Do what you need to to survive but always be planning for what’s next.
Makes a good side hustle and also for people who are in-between jobs and need a temporary income substitute.
One of the best posts. Good job 👍

@clarence_goh
Thanks for sharing! Do you have to bike long distance to get to work? My office in the CBD area is quite far from my house so I'm not sure if I should switch from MRT to bike yet.
If you really wanna buy cars, don’t buy it with debts, buy it with 💰 cash
I think the reason why people dont cycle is bcs world today is NOT SAFE. Especially for women, anything could happen nowadays if they cycle ALONE ☹️
Do you shower after getting to work?
But if use to drive grab???
I wish I could cycle in KL.
My office doesn’t have a toilet to shower in tho :/

Thoughts on owning a motorbike instead?
@c.heery bike from tanpines to Boon Lay g?
I remember a Jeopardy final a few years ago that asked to name the invention Susan B. Anthony thought did more for women’s liberation than anything else. The answer (question): What is a bicycle? I’d never heard the quote before, but “bicycle” was the immediate and only thing that popped in my mind during the final Jeopardy music. It was all that to me on a personal level. I used to have dream cars (VW Bug, then VW Thing, then a hearse), but once I got a road bike, the world cracked open and I still see no need for a car. Trucks and things that haul shit, sure, but a car? No.

@desipermata.s
Forcing a profession to your children is not cool, but I think it's important to teach them that career choice would have HUGE impact on how their life shapes up. In ideal world they can be whatever they want to, but this isn't an ideal world and there are some careers that simply more lucrative, more needed, or more fulfilling than others. By teaching them this you can help them to be more responsible in making the choice and in owning the consequences of that choice. I for one rue that my parents didn't tell me this
@nickdop
Thank you for this... ❤️ I’m positive that with this post you have helped many (including myself) who have been struggling between the traditional values inculcated in us since young and the burgeoning realisation that we could have been reduced to something less than our true worth... i.e. an asset rather than a child 😂

brilliant. if you love your child without expecting anything in return, your child will most likely do the same. you have to earn it. the same goes to the child. if you're stilll trying to live off your parents even after you reach adulthood, screw you. family obligations are over-glorified.

I agree!! Except neither me nor my bf get paid vacations (we’re self employed) so we can’t do long trips either as we’re losing money! Dilemma 😅
Worked on a farm for a month in Taiwan in exchange for food and accommodation. Found through WWOOF. Awesome experience, makes you appreciate your food more too. :)
Short trips are exp but serve a different purpose - quick reboot / recharge every now and then to maintain peak performance (and earning capability)

No car, No clubbing, not drinking coffee, not smoking, not moving out 🤣👌🏻 TRAVEL YES @ben_butkus
So we don’t even get to enjoy our $6 latte daily or travel once a year then what’s the point of living? To live in extreme frugality and work hard Everyday to make some rich person even richer ?
I think there is a difference between making wise financial choices and saving hard versus living an empty frugal life , only to die one day realising we never enjoyed a single day because we were busy working so hard to make some rich capitalist/landowner even richer
