I would wait abit more for the price of REITs to subside. 😃 Just my opinion...
The single most important lesson I have learnt in investing is diversifying over time. Most people know to diversify their assets. But not many understand the power of diversifying across various time periods. Hence, if I were to invest $40k, I would invest $1000 monthly over the span of 40 months. When the market goes lower, I would buy the ETF more - whether STI or REITs. Retail investors who do not have time to monitor each REIT counter should simply buy the REITs ETF

When to start investing?
@mojojojojolene
I suggest that before one begins investing, one must first understand the limitations of investing. Only by understanding that would you be able to avoid silly and costly mistakes. This starts from an accurate understanding of how the stock market works. This is not a get rich scheme overnight, but it takes years to build up. S&P 500 index has returned 8% annually and you probably aren’t going to achieved better returns than that for most retail investors. Hence, always buy the index first.

Frankly, no contribution for 6 months means he will not do anything unless he has been working on something like creating a new product/service/writing a book etc. If the guy has some hope & the one for you, start planning your future together which must include financial-related goals. Having a shared future or dream will give both of you motivation to work towards the life you wish to have 😍
Long term Endowment policies provide a higher return than bonds of the same credit rating. An endowment is literally a 30% Equity 70% Bond portfolio product... Thus, providing a higher return due to the equity exposure.
Sweet!!
Great summary, thanks for the reminder 🙌

Meeting a good and reliable manager to trade and help you out on the internet is difficult, I have lost a lot of funds to scammers but since I have been trading and investing with my best manager (Mr Marek Kruzsel) I have been able to recover some of my funds back and I’m also happy now. You can also make some funds too...contact him @marekkruzsel5 or WhatsApp +18634561459

Theresa May is still the PM, she has however, as of 7 June, resigned as Leader of the UK Conservative Party to allow the party to start the process of electing a new Leader who will then be appointed as PM by the Queen after Theresa May resigns as PM.

I have been to Moscow and I’m pretty sure the latte doesn’t cost that much. In fact I did a quick Google search and it’s actually S$5ish. I did note where you get the information that Russia might have the most expensive Starbucks coffee price in the world though. It is adjusted to US spending power. Russia’s average wage is about S$1,600 a month and 5/1600 in % correlates to US$12.32/average American wage. Perhaps you might want to better explain this because it may be confusing and discouraging to people who want to visit Russia and I know some Russians who might be offended by this information that’s not completely representative of the truth.
Love your feed! 👍😊

Personally, I prefer Income Sources - Savings - Income Generating Assets = Balance for Expenses. That way, savings and investment funds becomes a priority instead of something that only comes after.
I would personally have preferred an alternative route of setting aside the amount for saving/investment purposes before expenses haha! But great graphics you’ve there anyway!
