Does using cash really make you spend less? Theoretically speaking, it doesn't. The use of cashless payment methods such as credit cards and bank apps actually helps people save money compared to using cash, with all things being equal. Whether it is through cashback you enjoy, discounts you receive or through higher interest because you kept your unused money in a savings account instead of your wallet. When you go one step deeper to think about this issue, you may realise that holding cash is counter intuitive towards building more savings. Imagine a hypothetical situation where everyone was paid his or her salary in cash, rather than for it to be deposited directly into your savings account. Will we really end up saving more, or be spending more instead? As we move towards a cashless nation, we must build technology that not only enables us to spend in a convenient manner, but to also save and invest easily. We imagine apps that notify kids to set aside money in their long-term designated savings account, and to receive some gifts like free vouchers to reward them for hitting savings goals. This makes saving money fun, rewarding and most importantly, convenient.	dnssingapore	0	37	http://instagram.com/p/BZ77o9bHqBm/	dnssingapore
The cost of healthcare and productivity losses stemming from obesity in Asia alone is roughly $226 billion. Half of the adults living with diabetes in the world also lives in Asia. The simple solution is to get people to start engaging in an active and healthy lifestyle from a young age. Working with AIA Vitality, youth coaches from English Premier League football team Tottenham Hotspurs go around certain Asian countries, including China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia and others to get children to start playing football. Enjoying the game from a young age will mean they grow up playing regularly, and ultimately keeping an active lifestyle sweating it out with their friends. The best stay healthy and fit is to play a sport that you enjoy.	dnssingapore	2	20	http://instagram.com/p/BZp3yN2nlCU/	dnssingapore

In his National Day Rally speech, PM Lee highlighted the serious problem of diabetes in Singapore. Today, approximately one in nine Singaporeans have diabetes, with Singapore having the 2nd highest proportion of diabetics among developed nations. By 2050, it's estimated that there will be close to one million Singaporeans with Type 2 diabetes. To help address the healthcare needs of these people, AIA launched earlier this year the AIA Diabetes Care, a critical illness plan tailored specifically to pre-diabetics and Type 2 diabetics. Supplemented by the AIA Vitality Programme, AIA Diabetes Care encourages its members to be proactive about adopting lifestyle choice that will lead to healthier outcomes. These include picking up healthy eating habits, keeping an active lifestyle and going for regular health screening. #dollarsandsense #aiavitality #diabetes #dnssingapore	dnssingapore	0	13	http://instagram.com/p/BZfhaxcHW_l/	dnssingapore
Being a bankrupt in Singapore carries an unfortunate stigma in society.

The second you pay for your 4D bet, you’ve already lost money, here’s why. The payouts are simply not attractive enough. For every $1 you wager on 4D, you will lose $0.42 on a Small bet, and $0.341 on a Big bet. So how much more would you have if you invested instead of gambled in 4D in the last 10 years? Let’s assume you bet $5, in equal proportion for Small and Big bets for all three 4D draws in a week for the past 10 years, you would have gambled $7,800, and on average, received $4,832.10 from your bets. If you have invested the money in a safe investment such as the STI ETF, you would have been able to achieve close to double of your investment based on its past 10 years of records. (Bearing in mind that you would not have put in a lump sum at the beginning and to ride out the volatility of the markets). Someone always wins when you buy 4D. Hint: its not you!	dnssingapore	0	18	http://instagram.com/p/BZFwN6OHlw6/	dnssingapore

We're grateful for the calm weather in Hong Kong today. Just a few days ago, the situation was very different. The deadly Typhoon Hato hit Hong Kong and Macau, 12 people were killed, more than 26,000 people were evacuated to temporary shelters and 450 flights were cancelled. Natural disasters bring with them much devastations to a country. On top of the loss of innocent lives and costly infrastructure damage, countries are also affected by disruptions to businesses and public services, including the closure of the Hong Kong stock exchange, numerous factories and countless offices. Share with us your thoughts on how you think natural disasters can affect a country's economy in other ways.	dnssingapore	0	24	http://instagram.com/p/BYaG4lBBhYH/	dnssingapore

Economics of Healthcare: Singapore ranks 2nd in Asia with the high 'out-of-pocket' spending vs other channels such as Government-financed healthcare, Social health and private health insurances. Major trends leading to the increasing healthcare spending includes ageing population of higher medical costs, wealthier societies encourage wealthier people to spend more on health and medical, rising government health expenditure burden, health cost inflation (by advances in medicine) and growing perception of insurance needs.	dnssingapore	0	26	http://instagram.com/p/BGdMl_1o0hK/	dnssingapore

When we add the renovation cost to the interest cost, what we get is the actual amount that we spent on our home. The total basic cost adds up to $552,000, excluding any maintenance cost incurred. So a person selling their home for $600,000 should not feel too excited.	dnssingapore	1	38	http://instagram.com/p/BFjHuXOI0rw/	dnssingapore

It is normal to judge the cost of a home simply by looking at its selling price. People asked each other about that all the time. “How much did you pay for your home?” However, the true cost of owning a home is a lot more than just its selling price. And if you are a potential buyer of your first home, we like to elaborate more on this so that you are not at the receiving end of a rude shock in the future.	dnssingapore	2	41	http://instagram.com/p/BFjHaJjI0rP/	dnssingapore
