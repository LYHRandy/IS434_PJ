Can‚Äôt deny that CPF is great, but CPF does have its negative downsides as well. It‚Äôs a well known fact that Singapore birth rate has declined significantly over the years, hence the number of people to replace the current working class has decreased. With decreasing working class, number of people being subjected to CPF decreases as well. Hence, eventually CPF will (a) run out of money (b) increase the contribution percentage. Singapore is trying its best to gather more people by allow foreigners to migrate over in hopes that it will convince them to stay and be subjected to CPF and taxes. But has it been that case? Most people who takes up citizenship eventually returns to their country, hence further complicating the CPF and tax situation. Another issue is that millennials are taking up more freelance jobs, which are not required to contribute to CPF (grab food, grab driver, designers, event coordinators, etc) this also contributes to the issue of decrease in money within CPF. The only way around that specific issue is (a) government enforces everyone to contribute (b) continue to struggle finding funds for CPF. All these are pointers should be pointed out about CPF before completely trusting CPF. While, I highly doubt that funds within CPF will ever run out but it‚Äôs to our best interest to keep in mind that many things are going to change drastically in the years to come.	clockwerkangels	5	423	http://instagram.com/p/B2qNZtvl7Qy/	thewokesalaryman

The intent of this piece and artwork are great. But this applies to only a minority. Truth is, many people have no choice but to work long hours from civil servants to taxi drivers to cleaners. Its just the way our society is. So we cant simply say we can work less and therefore we have time for family.

The saddest thing is many young couples may want to save money and have more intimate events, but they get guilted and pressured by parents into organising bigger, grander, noisier but ultimately hollower weddings. All so the parents can show off to compete with their other relatives or friends. Hope more go down the route of what you described, a lot of these so-called tradition must haves are pointless and take up a lot of money we don't have.	whimkimm	56	1,476	http://instagram.com/p/B1n9ww7l9SL/	thewokesalaryman

I also believe in this strongly. I would rather rely on myself to make my own fortune than rely on parents. That said, the mindset that the wealthy have about money is the one that helps them to make more money and having the right connections helps. A lot. So having wealthy parents who can help you to make even more money helps tremendously. Due to poverty, my parents tend to spend all whatever they have some money (strike 4D, for example) and have no proper financial planning and management. When my father got hospitalised that's when everything gone to shit. I'm glad that tough period is over and I've learnt and grew up a lot from it.	arielnyanko	58	1,658	http://instagram.com/p/B08eWSVFE0x/	thewokesalaryman

I remember a Jeopardy final a few years ago that asked to name the invention Susan B. Anthony thought did more for women‚Äôs liberation than anything else. The answer (question): What is a bicycle? I‚Äôd never heard the quote before, but ‚Äúbicycle‚Äù was the immediate and only thing that popped in my mind during the final Jeopardy music. It was all that to me on a personal level. I used to have dream cars (VW Bug, then VW Thing, then a hearse), but once I got a road bike, the world cracked open and I still see no need for a car. Trucks and things that haul shit, sure, but a car? No.	yndawycih	47	961	http://instagram.com/p/B0ZjyrbFE8n/	thewokesalaryman

Forcing a profession to your children is not cool, but I think it's important to teach them that career choice would have HUGE impact on how their life shapes up. In ideal world they can be whatever they want to, but this isn't an ideal world and there are some careers that simply more lucrative, more needed, or more fulfilling than others. By teaching them this you can help them to be more responsible in making the choice and in owning the consequences of that choice.
