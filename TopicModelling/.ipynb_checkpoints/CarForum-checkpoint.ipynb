This is what the OTP was originally planned for, to protect buyers as they have the most to loose. The sellers are obliged to exercise SNP and if he fails to do so, the buyer may seek legal mediation (sue the seller). This question brings up the revelation that many ppl on this thread have had no experience in buying/selling properties. I've been through many transactions in my experience in property investments and I can tell you that the rules are meant to bring down the valuation, which was originally meant to hold prices, at a faster pace.Ask yourself why was valuation implemented, and for HDB who's in control? You might think that a private company is doing the valuation but after searching you would be shock to know that all valuations eventually come from or are approved by HDB. Yes, HDB has been holding up resale prices for so long as sellers can use this tool to influence their buyers which will result in stable prices accross the HDB segment. Why does HDB always falls or increases after PTD properties (PTE properties always take the lead)? This is because HDB is controlling the valuation and that acts as a pillar for sellers and affects the offers made by buyers.You might think that PTE properties have valuations too right? Yes but it's difference and assigned by the banks which explains why some banks give you a higher valuation while some lower. It's also illegally possible to bribe the valuator giving your home a higher valuation (ahem!).Now, let me come back to the new HDB rule:1. This will bring about faster devaluation because in a dropping market, the sellers have no clue how much their flats are valued at. The previous transaction could already be sold at under valuation (CUV) and if it's based on that, the seller having no clue whatsoever, would base his at the same or around the same. The buyer, knowing that it's a falling market, would base it lower. Hence, without a controlling valuation set by HDB, the buyer could be paying CUV on top of an already undervalued figure. All else equal, the revse could be true for a booming market but read my next point below.2. Now you might think that it might help boost the current market right? Wrong.

Government also quite slow to implement policies, as we know sometimes for policy is pass through need at least 6 months duration. Just look at the jover chew at sim lim case. The government already admit it that it may take sometime for them to make changes to the policy. Its a joke man, I do hope that government to always remember, banks are there only for 1 thing KPI because of cheap $, they are drown by cheap $. Like I mentioned before if government never step in on tdsr, I think today property prices maybe much higher or tge bubble already burst. Do banks care about fundemdals? No!

UHome Interior Design in Upper Paya Lebar Road charges a similar rate and its doors come with a 15-month warranty.', '371': 'Last month, the HDB offered a new package offering doors and sanitary fittings including wash basins, taps and shower mixers costing between $3,190 and $4,330.', '372': 'Sanitary fittings have never featured in the OCS before.', '373': 'An HDB spokesman said sanitary fittings were introduced to provide greater flexibility and to minimise wastage when buyers choose to customise their own fittings during renovation.', '374': 'The market rate for taps ranges from $20 to $300. Sinks cost between $40 and $300 and shower mixers start below $100 and can go up to $500.', '375': 'Some home buyers, like Miss L. P. Lim, 37, who is unemployed, said the doors-plus-sanitary-fittings deal makes the package more attractive.', '376': 'She added that she was generally pleased with what HDB has on offer. \"One is really paying for convenience. You don\\'t have to worry about the basics because those are taken care of and it\\'s hassle free for owners. All in all it works out to be quite a good deal.\"', '377': 'An HDB spokesman said the doors are sourced from suppliers and it requires its suppliers to ensure good workmanship and finishes. The agency sets out detailed specifications for the installation, ironmongery and locksets of its doors. Its doors also go through a series of tests to ensure their durability.', '378': '\"Installation works are carried out by professional contractors and supervised by a team of consultants. HDB also provides a one-year Defects Liability Period, during which all defective items, if any, will be rectified,\" he said.', '379': 'He added: \"As these standards are good practices and not regulations, it is likely the doors supplied by renovation contractors may not meet similar standards.\"', '380': 'Mr Poh Chin Tiong, 54, the boss of Best Industrial in Kaki Bukit, said HDB owners typically buy doors that cost around $200 each.', '381': '\"The doors installed at such a price add value to the house. But those on a tighter budget can opt for cheaper doors such as classic doors with hollow cores that we sell for about $100,\" he said.', '382': 'Driving instructor Muhammad Suhaimi, 29, who bought a four-room flat in Yishun last year, said he is perplexed by the price disparity, a view echoed by most home owners The Straits Times spoke to.', '383': '\"Why are private contractor rates cheaper? HDB is buying and installing in bulk. It doesn\\'t make sense to me,\" said Mr Muhammad.', '384': 'Ms Ivy Tang, 31, an executive in the container industry, said that HDB should flag and explain to home buyers the pros and cons of opting in or out of the doors scheme.', '385': '\"HDB should pre-empt buyers who might opt in out of convenience, to do their own research and calculations, be it for flooring, doors or sanitary fittings,\" she said.', '386': 'The HDB spokesman said optional components are generally popular among home buyers.', '387': \"About 70 per cent of those who selected a flat in this year's January and March BTO sales exercises, for instance, opted for at least one item under the scheme - for either doors or flooring, or both.\", '388': 'He said: \"Many buyers continue to select them as they do not then have to engage their own contractors to do the works later on.\"', '389': 'Others such as Mr Musbah Hashim, 52, who is unemployed, said they have little choice but to opt in.', '390': 'He bought a four-room flat in Choa Chu Kang two weeks ago. \"We cannot pay private contractors cash up front, so we have to to opt in as the money can be deducted from our CPF,\" he said.', '391': 'Self-sourced doors differ from what HDB has to offer, said Mr Toh Chee Boon, 40, the deputy director of China Construction, which is handling four HDB projects.', '392': '\"HDB doors are firmer internally and more durable. Stringent checks are also in place to ensure that the doors installed are of good quality,\" he said.', '393': 'Ultimately, consumers have a right to exercise their choice, said Mr Seah Seng Choon, the executive director of the Consumers Association of Singapore.', '394': '\"Buyers need to determine if they are comparing apple to apple. If quality seems the same, they can always get their own private contractors at lower cost.\"', '395': 'melodyz@sph.com.sg'}\n",

', '14': '\"Given the sharp rise in credit growth over the last few years, I would not be surprised if an increase in interest rates is followed by deterioration in the loans portfolio of banks and other financial institutions; this would in turn lead to a tightening of credit supply and a higher cost of financing for credit in general.\"', '15': 'He still believes the Asian market will continue growing, despite the impending halt of liquidity from the Fed.

Corporate balance sheets are similarly healthy, and although the net debt-to-equity ratio increased to 26.1 per cent from 18.3 per cent after the Lehman Brothers' crisis in 2008, this is still well below the 41.8 per cent in 1994, when the Fed began to raise interest rates. \", '17': 'Despite a relatively sharp rise in debt over the past few years, the gross debt-to-GDP ratio for Asian economies excluding Japan averaged 46.4 per cent, with GDP growth for this year and the next likely to average 6.3 per cent.

This news article is one example, they have stastic that household debt is not improving. Its not the 1st time they use the word monitor on the household debt. Do the government want to mointor till it goes out of control or go in situation where the problem is too big then start to do something drastic about it? Remember to make policy changes it takes time, need to debate in Parliament, draft bills, etc. turnaround time is at least 6 months. Do they think they have enough time to reverse the situiation when it goes out of control? I rather they start early implement drasic measures to reverse the situation now, rising consumer debt is not new and its been propping up in the news for many years and is getting worst. Not now then when? Wait till its too late to do something about it?', '927': 'Monitor means eye power.
