4 min readFor most girls, we will be introduced to our first menstrual product at the age of 12. At $5-$8 a pack, disposable pads are expensive, but with it being our first, introductory menstrual product, most of us stick to it as a matter of convenience and familiarity.

With the emergence of new alternatives to disposable pads and tampons, the average modern-day girl now has a wider range of products to choose from. With our society evolving to be more environmentally conscious, there have also been more innovative, and environmentally friendly ways in which girls can deal with their periods.
So how much does it actually cost if you were to use disposable pads for the rest of your life? How much would you save if you choose to switch to a more environmentally friendly product?
TL;DR: A Cross Comparison On Menstrual Products And How Much It Costs


Cost of pads: $12.42 a month, $149.04 a year and $5,961.60 (puberty-menopause)
Cost of tampons:  $22.78 per month,  $273.36 a year, and $10,934.40 (puberty-menopause)

How Much You Will Be Spending On Disposable Pads & Tampons, From Puberty To Menopause:
Disposable Pads
As a girl, you will probably be using pads from the age of 12-14, till you hit menopause- where a dip in hormones will stop you from having your period- between the age of 45 to 55.
Of course, the length of which each girl bleeds during her menstrual cycle greatly differs from one person to another, so let us focus on the following assumptions while calculating the costs:

An average woman has her period for 40 years (12- 52 years old) of her life.
The average woman has her period regularly every month.
The process of menstruation lasts for a total of 7 days: 3 days of heavy flow, 4 days of light flow.
The average cost of a pack of pads are as follows:

$6.50 for 1 pack, 16 pcs normal-heavy flow- ($0.40/pc)
$5 for 1 pack, 16 pcs normal-light flow- ($0.30/pc)
$2.80, 1 pack, 40 pcs: For residual stains, etc. – ($0.07/pc)


Every month, the average girl changes her pad 6 times a day for ‘heavy flow’ days, and 4 times a day during ‘lighter flow’ days.
After her period, she decides to put panty liners for the next  2 days to prevent stain. She will be incurring the following cost every month:




 How many pads? Cost Per Pad Cost 




Day 1 (Heavy Flow)6$0.40$2.40


Day 2 (Heavy Flow)6$0.40$2.40


Day 3 (Heavy Flow)6$0.40$2.40


Day 4 (Light Flow)4$0.30$1.20 


Day 5 (Light Flow)4$0.30$1.20 


Day 6 (Light Flow)4$0.30$1.20 


Day 7 (Light Flow)4$0.30$1.20 


Day 8 (Stains)3$0.07$0.21


Day 9 (Stains)3$0.07$0.21


TOTAL40 -$12.42 



In total, the average girl spends a total of $12.42 per month just on disposable pads.
$12.42 X 12 = $149.04 (1 YEAR)
In 40 years, she would have spent about $5,961.60 on disposable pads.
Disposable Tampons
For tampons, assuming you are changing just as regularly as stated above, here’s a breakdown on the cost:

The average price of tampons is at $12/pack (18 pcs)- ($0.67/pc)
Assume the above conditions.




 How Many Tampons? Cost Per Tampon Cost 




Day 1 (Heavy Flow)6$0.67$4.02 


Day 2 (Heavy Flow)6$0.67$4.02 


Day 3 (Heavy Flow)6$0.67$4.02 


Day 4 (Light Flow)4$0.67$2.68


Day 5 (Light Flow)4$0.67$2.68


Day 6 (Light Flow)4$0.67$2.68


Day 7 (Light Flow)4$0.67$2.68


TOTAL 34-$22.78



For those who use disposable tampons, you will be spending $22.78 per month. This amount adds to $273.36 a year, and subsequently $10,934.40 from puberty to menopause (40 years), if you were consistently using tampons since young.
Hidden Environmental Costs Of Pads & Tampons

Other than the upfront costs of disposable pads and tampons, using these products entail numerous environmental costs as well:

Widespread use of these disposable products comes with an environmental cost at end of use. It has been estimated that a regular non-organic pad can take 500–800 years to break down and as plastic makes up such a large amount of these products, they will never truly biodegrade.
Tampons are significantly quicker to biodegrade at around six months, as they are mostly made from natural materials such as cotton. However, many brands of tampons contain plastics withing them and are wrapped with plastics.
According to a study, under the presence of light, plastics can be broken down into smaller fragments before becoming microplastics, which can pose a serious threat to marine systems and human health.
Figures from the Marine Conservation Society reveal that on average, 4.8 pieces of menstrual waste are found per 100 metres of beach cleaned. For every 100m of beach, that amounts to 4 pads, panty-liners and backing strips, along with at least one tampon and applicator.
As we try cutting disposables out of our everyday lives, perhaps taking the extra effort of changing out disposable pads for reusable, eco-friendly products is truly a step we as women can take in making our earth more inhabitable.
Other Alternatives You Can Try
1. Reusable Pads

If you’re most comfortable with using pads, disposable pads are a comfortable, sustainable and cheaper alternative. To ensure that the pad doesn’t move around, you can secure the clips of the wings. Most reusable pads are made with a breathable, cotton material so that it is comfortable.
Do note, however, that the pads do not have a ‘sticky’ adhesive bottom layer, so you may want to use a tighter pair of panties to make sure it doesn’t move around as much.
Places To Buy: HannahPad (starting from S$9.95), Eco Femme Reusable Cloth Pads (starting from S$13.90)
2. Flex (Disposable Menstrual Disk)

Acting just like a menstrual cup, Flex is a disposable menstrual disc that can last up to 12 hours without leaks. Unlike the menstrual cup, flex boasts a thinner, softer cup that sits comfortably in your body when inserted. Each disc holds as much as 5 tampons, and don’t have to be changed as regularly as pads or tampons.
While this product is more convenient as compared to menstrual cups, it may not be as cost-saving as getting a menstrual cup.
Places To Buy: Flex (S$15)
3. Period Panties

Period panties allow you to bleed freely without worrying about leaks. Each panty is made out of 4 micro-layers of absorbent material that keeps the underwear dry and free from bacteria.
Places To Buy: Thinx (~S$45), Modi Bodi (~S$35), or The Period Co. (starting from S$24.90).
4. Menstrual Cups

Menstrual cups burst into popularity a few years back, though there are still many who are hesitant in trying it. Designed for various sizes, these cups are designed to collect period blood instead of absorbing them and is folded and inserted into the vagina.
Each cup can hold up to 12 hours of period flow and can be used for up to five to ten years before it’s replaced.
You can refer below for the different pros and cons of each product.
