3 min readNothing beats the feeling of TGIF and Saturday night.
For some Singaporeans, Friday and Saturday nights are more predictable where they catch up with sleep and spend time with their family.
For a percentage of us, not so.

We will be doing shots and drinking at the bars, trying to get our friends drunk on their birthday. Fun times!

Further Reading: Sometimes it is more than just money
Of course, life does not necessarily be all about costs. There are certain element found at the bar or a club which cannot be measured in money.
Factors such as:

Good music by the live band or the DJ
Good service by the bar or the club
The possibility of meeting new friends
The ambience of the place
The “shiok baller” feeling when getting drinks at the clubs or bars


Living life in moderation is important. A good guideline to check if you are overspending on lifestyle such as drinking is to go back to the 50/30/20 rule.
Drinking should come from the expenses pile when one has sufficient to spare. If not the recipe above works.
