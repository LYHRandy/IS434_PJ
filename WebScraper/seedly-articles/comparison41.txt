3 min readIn Singapore, there are typically 2 types of Bak Kut Teh – the Teochew style, with the peppery clear soup that we commonly see around us and the Hokkien style which comes with the brown herbal soup.
Which type of BKT are you?

Teochew Style – the ones with lots of pepper and garlic
Hokkien Style – the herbal ones

Bookmark this page as you will never know when the BKT-feels will hit you.

Ya Hua Bak Kut Teh
Kind: Teochew Style (Pepper)
Also known as Outram Ya Hua Bak Kut Teh, they serve Teochew-style BKT full of peppery flavour but not having it overpowering the whole flavour.
So if you feel like having a Teo-chew style BKT that doesn’t have a strong peppery taste, you know where to go!

Price: Approx. $10/person

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh 松發肉骨茶
Kind: Teochew Style (Pepper)
With 8 locations and growing, Song Fa BKT is one of the more popular and commercialised BKT franchise.
However, I would recommend that you visit another outlet than North Bridge’s as it is usually swamped with tourists. That’s how popular they are!

Old Street Bak-Kut-Teh
Kind: Both, Teochew Style (Pepper) and Hokkien Style (Herbal)
Old Street serves only peppery soups and their sauce-counter makes me feel like I made a trip down to Hai Di Lao which allows me to DIY my own sauce.

Soon Huat Bak Kut Teh 順發肉骨茶

Kind: Hokkien Style (Herbal)

At face value, we see Soon Huat serving us one of the best BKT, but apart from that, they are a business all about second chances. With their social mission being,
“To provide ex-offenders a new start in life with a meaningful career”
If that does not make you want to patronise them, we don’t know what else would. Or maybe if you are craving for the dry version of BKT, we heard they are dee-lish!

Price: ~$10/pax
