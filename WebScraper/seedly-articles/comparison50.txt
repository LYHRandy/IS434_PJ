2 min readHave you ever been so lazy to walk out and get food that you rather order using food delivery services? Me too.
I have always presumed that the menu for McDonald’s in-stores would be priced the same as compared to McDelivery (not inclusive of delivery fee).
But it’s not.

TL;DR – How much more are you spending on food delivery?
If you can only take away ONE thing from this article, this paragraph should be it.

McDelivery/ GrabFood: 38% more expensive
Deliveroo: 31% more expensive 
foodpanda: 22% more expensive

How many of us have been so lazy to head out to grab food in-stores that you give in to food delivery with a press of a button? That press of a button costs you 38% more, instantly.
So if you have been ordering McDelivery when McDonald’s is just at your void deck, you need to do some self-reflection and save yourself some money.
