The lower 20% earners in Singapore’s income is less than their monthly expenditure. Every month, they are exceeding their monthly income by $335.
Should they have no way of covering back this additional $335 expenses incurred, they get trapped in a cycle of debt.
The difference in monthly household expenditure between the top 20% earners and the bottom 20% in Singapore is about $5,003.
For the higher income, their monthly expenditure is not even one-third of their monthly household income, which means they will only get richer with each passing month.

The lower 20% earning household in Singapore, on the other hand, face a high chance of getting stuck in this cycle with no extra cash to pull themselves out of the poverty cycle. Their never-ending cycle with debt will only add on to their financial burden each money.
This is how real Singapore’s poverty situation can get for the lower income.

As for Singaporeans households that are on the 21st – 40th quintile and above, their income sits on a very comfortable level.

21st – 40th quintile: Income exceeds expenditure by $2,228
41st – 60th quintile: Income exceeds expenditure by $4,866
61st – 80th quintile: Income exceeds expenditure by $8,581
Above 80th quintile: Income exceeds expenditure by $19,014

This further enhances the point that the rich will only get richer.

How we can do better – breaking that usual cycle?

If you find your household spending more than the average, maybe it’s time to watch your expenses.
Two ways Singaporean are stretching their household expenditure: spending on necessary item (expenditure fats) and spending on a wrong investment product

Breaking down our expenses: In search of household expenditure fats
The most immediate way to getting better with our household expenditure is to get rid of our expenditure fats. Below is a quick overview of average monthly household expenditure according to age range.



 <30 years old30-39 years old40-49 years old50-59 years old>60 years old




Housing related expenses$830$888$761$595$552


Food$997$1,235$1,245$1,280$1,019


Transport$573$988$990$805$538


Recreation$398$449$443$407$307


Educational Services$166$279$456$383$117


Health$212$271$233$268$284

Clothes & Foorwear$140$194$175$164$103


Others (eg. Cigarettes, beer, manicure)$513$824$808$698$505



If we translate the above information into bar charts, we noticed that the 3 main categories Singaporeans of all ages spend on are:

Housing
Food
Transport

Other than health, education and housing which might be subjective, one can take a look at the rest of his expenditure in terms of category every month to find out which area is he spending too much on.
Two ways to track your expenses effectively:

An expense tracking app like Seedly (it’s free to use!)

Getting The Right Investment Product
Your paycheque and savings account can only get you so far.
Choosing the right investment product should always be at the back of your mind.
It’s not uncommon for people to be sold investment-linked products by their insurance agents even if they don’t fully understand or know that they can keep the protection and investment elements apart.
In fact, some of these people might be better off investing in other financial products like the Singapore Savings Bond (SSB) if they are properly educated!
