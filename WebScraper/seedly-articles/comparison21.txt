Which Travel Insurance Is The Best For Me?
I often ask myself this question when I start planning my travels.
And unfortunately, most people make the common mistake of buying travel insurance way too late.
Before you read on, here’s rule #1 of travel insurance…
Always BUY your travel insurance when you book your flights! Not a week after booking. And not a day before you fly. IMMEDIATELY!
This is due to complications that can happen prior to your trip (eg. volcanoes erupting or snow storms that bury towns… basically natural disasters which we as Singaporeans never stop to think about because of where we are situated).
Anyways, if you’d like to find out what’s the best travel insurance to get for your overseas travels, then you’ve come to the right place!
To make it even easier for you to decide you can even check out our Seedly Reviews where you can read close to a thousand unbiased reviews left by real users from our Seedly community!

Best Travel Insurance Comparison 2019

1) For Best Value: MSIG TravelEasy
Overall: With the  $150k personal accident coverage, and a relatively generous lost belongings coverage at $500 per item. The plan arguably offers the best bang for the buck.



Product NameMSIG Travel Easy Standard




Personal Accident Payment$150,000


Medical Expenses (Overseas)$250,000


Cancelled TripMax $5,000


Lost BelongingsUp to $500 per item, pair, or set of items



Recently, they made an improvement to this plan to cover pre-existing illness with the MSIG TravelEasy Pre-Ex option which you can also buy from their site.
Here’s what a community member had to say about their service:
“I switched to MSIG when I realised the price can be quite comparable/competitive to others when they offer a discount (they offer discounts quite frequently). What I find specifically superior about MSIG’s coverage is that baggage delay can be claimed in blocks of 6 hours when most insurers cover in blocks of 8 hours. This proved to be of value to me when I found myself experiencing a 36 hours delay in my baggage when taking MAS to Seoul. When I first arrived at Incheon Airport and found out that my luggage was still stuck at KL airport during the stopover, I called the MSIG travel insurance helpdesk and the customer service officer was very patient to assure me of my coverage and also explain to me what I need to do in order to smoothen my claim process. 
 MSIG to my surprise and delight, not only responded to me quickly (within a week) but decided to give me benefit of the doubt and paid out to me maximum claim for the delay ($900 x 3 pax = $2.7k). I cannot remember exactly how long it took to receive the payout in my bank account but my impression was it didn’t take long. Due to this pleasant experience (albeit unpleasant travel experience) with MSIG, I highly recommend everyone to consider buying from them too.”

2) For Accident And Medical Expenses: GE TravelSmart Basic
Overall: It has one of the highest Personal Accident and Medical expenses coverage at around $300k and $500k respectively, just for a basic plan.



Product NameGE Travel Smart Basic




Personal Accident$300,000

Lost BelongingsUp to $500 per item, pair or set of items



Here’s what a community member had to say about their service:
“Bought a travel insurance on discount last November. Unfortunately, my baggage was damaged. Fuss-free and not much to submit, most importantly, I got my claim very fast!”

3) For Cancelled Trips: FWD Travel Premium
Overall: Probably the youngest entrant on the market, this allows them to combine the best customer experience with very affordable premiums. FWD has a pretty decent coverage for cancelled trips.



Product NameFWD Travel Basic




Personal Accident$200,000


Medical Expenses (Overseas)$200,000


Cancelled TripMax $7,500


Lost BelongingsUp to $300 per item, pair or set of items



Here’s what a community member had to say about their service:
“I purchase FWD travel insurance for a trip to Beijing last year. My china eastern flight was delayed for take-off due to heavy snow. Luckily, the airline arranged hotel accommodation for us. With the documents issued by the airline confirming the flight delay, cause and the amount of time it lasted. I got a compensation of about $150 from FWD. The process is hassle-free and easy via the online platform of FWD.”

4) For Lost Belongings: AXA TravelSmart
Overall: A stalwart in the insurance scene, AXA’s offering allows you to claim the highest amount per item for lost belongings.



Product NameAXA SmartTraveller Basic




Personal Accident$250,000


Medical Expenses (Overseas)$300,000


Cancelled TripMax $6,000


Lost BelongingsUp to $800 per item, pair or set of items



Here’s what a community member had to say about their service:
“I made a medical claim against the insurance through its online claim form. The process of filling up the form was relatively quick and easy, and supporting documents were required to be attached with the form to validate your claim. The claim went through in around 1 week plus without any issues. All in all, the application and claiming process could be done quickly and easily. Quite a pleasant experience. “

5) For Pre-Existing Condition: NTUC Enhanced PreX
Overall: The only player in the market which takes on the risk to insure the pre-existing clients for overseas travel, usually at a premium. This will save you the pain and trouble of what happened to a sad case where a family had to raise money to bring their comatose father home from Japan in 2017.



Product NameNTUC Enhanced PreX




Personal Accident$150,000


Medical Expenses (Overseas)$250,000


Cancelled TripMax $5,000


Lost BelongingsUp to $500 per item, pair or set of items



Here’s what a community member had to say about their service:
“I went for my study trip overseas for 3 months. I compared NTUC income with various companies and the plan price and payout was most compatible for me. What I liked about it was it’s easy to comprehend terms and conditions, with less jargon.. basically it is made simple. I came into a mishap in the UK and was thankful for the relatively smooth service provided by NTUC Income at the time when I first contacted them as well as the follow thru with claims. A good experience with my purchase of travel insurance with them!”

6) For NSmen: AVIVA Travel Lite
Overall: The only player in the market who rewards you if you happen to be an NS Men who is STILL on the MINDEF/MHA life or personal accident policy.



Product NameAviva Travel Lite




Personal Accident$50,000


Medical Expenses (Overseas)$250,000


Cancelled TripMax $5,000


Lost BelongingsUp to $700 per item, pair or set of items



Here’s what a community member had to say about their service:
“I always use this product because it gives a discount for Aviva insurance policy owners, which almost every guy in Singapore has.”

7) For Adrenaline Junkies And Sports Enthusiasts: Etiqa Basic eProtect
Overall: We actually got quite a few people asking about this in our community (probably due to the youthful nature of our community folks) and naturally, we decided to do some research on travel insurance for travellers looking to do leisure sports and extreme sports.
FYI: There is a BIG difference between leisure sports vs. extreme sports.
Common Leisure Sports

Bungee Jumping
Hiking (below 3,000m from sea level)
Hot Air Balloon Ride
Hand Gliding
Paragliding
Sky Diving
Scuba Diving (within 30m)
Non-competitive winter sports (Snow/Ice Sports, Skiing, snowboarding etc)

Most insurance companies will have coverage for the activities listed above. However, it is important to note that the coverage only comes with premium travel insurance plans.
The only basic plan which provides coverage for Common Leisure Sports is Etiqa eProtect Basic. If you’d like to have a look at the full policy wording, check out page 21 clause (o)i.
Common Exclusions (Extreme Sports)
Take note that the coverage here is NOT for competitions which are played in a professional capacity or in which the Insured Person(s) would or could earn or receive remuneration, donations, sponsorship or reward of any kind.

Mountaineering or rock climbing that entails the use of specific climbing equipment and ropes
Hiking or trekking above 3,000 meters from sea level
Scuba Diving (beyond 30m)
