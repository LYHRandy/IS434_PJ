4 min readI frickinâ€™ love poke bowls.
Any form of raw fish is actually very welcome. I had my very first poke bowl perhaps aÂ year back when I found out about one of the OG poke bowl places, andÂ the rest was history. I mean, if youâ€™re going to be paying $6 for Kopitiam food in the CBD, might as well double that for a poke bowl, no? ðŸ˜›
Weâ€™ve put together this comprehensive list of poke places sorted by price for your reference (and also mine), because this means I will be having poke bowls for dayssssss! (My wallet says ouch, but my soulÂ says yes!)

The first thing that catches my eye is how affordable it is (a poke bowl for $9.90 is honestly pretty rare!) If youâ€™re in the mood for something less raw, they have torched and braised salmon options in bowls and rolls too.

Additional toppings such as an onsen egg ($1), half an avocado ($1.50), or ebiko ($1).
