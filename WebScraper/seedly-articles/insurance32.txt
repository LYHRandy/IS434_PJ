CareShield Life is basically ElderShield 2.0, newer but better, with a funky new name.
CareShield Life is almost similar to ElderShield but with better coverage, as part of the Government’s initiative to better address our ageing population.

What is CareShield Life?
Similar to ElderShield, CareShield Life offers a payout upon severe disability to help finance the long-term care cost.

Lifetime cash payouts 
– As long as you are severely disabled
Payouts increase over time
– Starting from S$600/month in 2020
Government subsidies available
Premiums fully payable by Medisave

An improvement from ElderShield

The original ElderShield 300 provided S$300/month for 5 years – wasn’t enough.
Upgraded it to ElderShield 400, which provided S$400/month for 6 years – still wasn’t enough.
Then birth the new CareShield Life.

*Base premium increases regularly to support payout increases, while catch-up component is flat.

Examples for opting for CareShield Life while on ElderShield:

Is the Government trying to profit from their citizens?

1.3 million ElderShield policyholders in 2017.
S$3.3 billion in premiums collected.
Only about $133 million was paid out in claims.

Previously when ElderShield was covered by only 3 insurers in Singapore resulted in profits which had caused uncertainty for the reason behind the government implementing CareShield Life.
As extracted from their statement, the government assured us that:

The premiums collected and returns from investments will stay within the fund so that policyholders can benefit through higher payouts or premium rebates.
Today, premiums collected under ElderShield are more than the claims paid out, as most policyholders are relatively young. However, these premiums collected do not become Government surpluses. Rather, they are meant for future claims – when policyholders become older and more of them make claims for severe disabilities (see Figure 1 for a comparison of premiums collected versus claims).
All CareShield Life premiums collected will remain within the fund meant for policyholders. It will not be transferred to other Government schemes.

What does the Community think?
Gabriel Tham – “One big problem government will face is increasing healthcare costs. The more healthcare costs increase, the more premium they have to take from Medisave.”
Ashlyn Ho – “Is everyone compulsory to pay this Careshield life? If yes, I’m concerned for those who are unemployed. Is Medisave sufficient to pay for Medishield life and now Careshield? We also need Medisave to be sufficient in case we really hospitalize.”
Kino Ng – “Sounds good, at least it helps those people who touch wood reached a very old age and unable to do the 3 out of 6 things and still managed to get the payout.”
