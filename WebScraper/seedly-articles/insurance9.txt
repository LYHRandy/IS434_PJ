4 min readThe lead up to Singaporeâ€™s 54th birthday has seen a slew of SG54 NDP deals and promotions on almost everything you can think of.
Including the recent $54 Huawei phone promotion that created more anger and frustration than anythingâ€¦

Ouch.
Well, itâ€™s okay if you missed that promo because PolicyPal and Singapore Life have an SG54 collaboration of their own: a 1.54% rebate on a 3 or 5-year short-term endowment plan which offers up to 2.38% returns per annum.
And thatâ€™s way better than any $54 smartphone because the returns youâ€™re getting isÂ higher than any bankâ€™s fixed deposit rates and even what the latest Singapore Savings Bond (SSB) would give you.

How Do I Purchase Singapore Life Endowment Series Four
This endowment plan is available for purchase through Singapore Life. But if youâ€™d like to enjoy the additional 1.54% rebate, youâ€™ll have to purchase it through the PolicyPal app.
Take note that the 1.54% rebate isÂ only valid for endowment plans purchased between 5 to 11 August 2019 (payment by 11:59 PM, 11 August 2019) through the PolicyPal app.

Endowment Series Four In Comparison To Singapore Savings Bonds (SSBs)
When it comes to low-risk investments, the benchmark that most Singaporeans have these days would be SSBs.

Looking at the current SSBâ€™s average return per year (bond id: GX1908E, issued 1 August 2019), holding it for three years only yields an average return of 1.68% per annum. Even if you held onto it for five years, the SSB would only yield an average return of 1.79% per annum.
Pictured above: Iâ€™m not actually a cat but you get the pictureâ€¦
This is as compared to 2.25% per annum over 3 years and 2.38% per annum over 5 years, depending on the term you choose to purchase your Endowment Series Four for (what a mouthful).
Basically, the returns for Singapore Lifeâ€™s Endowment Series Fourâ€™s 3 and 5-year options both beat SSBâ€™s hands down.
Iâ€™ve said this before and Iâ€™ll say it again, your capital with Singapore Life is SDIC guaranteed, but SSBs have the edge here because theyâ€™re government-backed.
Also, youâ€™ve got to be really sure that you wonâ€™t need the money anytime soon because youâ€™ll incur a surrender charge if you suddenly decide that you need your money before the 3 or 5-year maturity is up.
But with SSBs, you pay a S$2 transaction fee and youâ€™ll get your principal and any interest accruedÂ by the 2nd business day of the following month.

Unlike the other endowment plans weâ€™ve covered before, $5,000 should be within the reach of most Singaporeans. You just need to know how to allocate your monthly salary.
But if youâ€™re still saving up and making your way there, fret not.
Thereâ€™re alwaysÂ other alternativesÂ if youâ€™re looking for low-risk alternatives to invest your money. However, the options listed here all come with different lock-in periods, so choose wisely and consider when youâ€™ll need that money youâ€™re locking away:

This monthâ€™s SSB with a minimum cash outlay of S$500, no early termination charges. More details here.
Voluntary cash top-up to CPFÂ Ordinary Account (2.5% to 3.5%), Special Account (4% to 5%), and/or Medisave Account (4% to 5%). More detailsÂ here.
CIMB Fixed DepositsÂ at 1.9% p.a. More detailsÂ here.
High yield interest rate savings account. More detailsÂ here.

Should I Buy Singapore Lifeâ€™s Endowment Series Four?
As with any other endowment plan, the Endowment Series Four is also aÂ tranche product and is available while stocks last.
With this upcoming PolicyPal x Singapore Life 1.54% rebate promotion, it might be the additional sweetener for those looking to park their funds in an endowment plan.
But seriously, all of these factors shouldnâ€™t be part of your consideration when evaluating an endowment plan. You should always read theÂ terms and conditions carefully, and consider your investment horizon before you get unnecessarily penalised when you choose to surrender your plan before maturity.
Also, the 1.54% rebate will be given in the form of P$ credits, and are not encashable or transferrable. So unless youâ€™re an active user of PolicyPal, this rebate might not be all that great after allâ€¦

Remember: nobody cares about your money more than you do.
Except maybe your parents.
They love you more than anything in the world.
When was the last time you gave your mom or dad a call to ask them about their day? Go ahead and give them a call. Your folks will love it, even if they say they donâ€™t. ðŸ™‚
