2 min readStill in the McGriddles frenzy? Or never understood it, just wanted to grab a quick breakfast and go to work/ school?
Fast food restaurants provide decent breakfast meals at decent prices, although I would not recommend eating them every day because:

It is fattening.
It is cumulatively expensive. Imagine spending $5 on breakfast every weekday morning, that’s $100/month.
With that, you can actually invest that amount every month instead.


Which Fast Food Restaurant Can You Go for A Breakfast Meal?

McDonald’s
KFC
Burger King
Long John Silver’s

A breakfast meal usually consists of either coffee/tea and a hash brown.

Most Expensive: McDonald’s Breakfast Supreme at S$9.60.

Fast food restaurants serving porridge for breakfast is new to me, but I’m amazed that Long John Silver’s has so many porridge options!
But honestly, if you are going to walk into a fast food restaurant just to get porridge, maybe you should try one from the coffee shop instead. Unless it is a craving that you are trying to satisfy.
I hope that with this article, you will be able to make a smarter decision when it comes to purchasing your next breakfast meal from a fast food restaurant!
