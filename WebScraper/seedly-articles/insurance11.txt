2 min readAccording to the Singapore Cancer Society,

1 in every 37 Singaporeans are diagnosed with cancer every day;
16 people die from cancer every day; and
1 in 3 deaths is caused by cancer.


Wouldn’t you want to know as females are we more prone to diseases than our male counterparts?

Yes, though by a thin margin. 51.4%* of the incidence of cancers occurred in females.

*Numbers are extracted from the Singapore Cancer Registry Annual Registry Report 2015 (here) and are accurate as at 21 Jan 2019.
On the same note, breast cancer holds the highest occurrence among Singaporean Women, with 1,850 women being diagnosed and 400 deaths from the same disease which should not be taken lightly.

Insurance for Women in Singapore
with FREE health checkups!
These insurance plans specifically cater to only the needs of women. It provides coverage for a range of critical illnesses that only women are exposed to:

AIA Glow of Life
PruLady by Prudential
AXA CritiCare for Her
Lady 360 by Income

We all know that health checkups are quite costly, even a simple scan, for example, Vitality Executive Scan with Fullerton Healthcare Group would cost $105.93. That already is the discounted rate if you are an AIA Vitality member.
If your company provides for you free health checkups that is a bonus for you. However, if they don’t, this is one way you can save on those hefty checkup fees.

Note: The difference in coverage differs in premiums payable as well, as the premiums are not known to us, we are unable to make this comparison with premiums.

Though it seems as AIA Glow of Life has it a lot worse as compared to other insurance providers, we were told that the premiums for AIA were at least 50% cheaper. With more benefits and protection, you should expect the premiums to be more expensive.
It is difficult to propose which insurance plan would fit your situation best as there is no one size fits all, and many times you do not need that extra benefit that a certain insurance product provides. (It could be just a marketing gimmick to get you to spend more)
Do speak with a professional to analyse your needs proper before deciding on which women’s plan to get for yourself or your other half!
