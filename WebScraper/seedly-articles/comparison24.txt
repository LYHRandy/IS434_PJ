Turning finance into boba-sized pieces. One iced milk boba tea, please! You can contribute your thoughts like Cherie here.


3 min readKnowing that I’m a big fan of boba milk, the editor came up to me last week and went, “Eh bro, do you know about Milk Bro, bro?”
I was like, “Milk brobro?”
“Yeah… Milk Bro, bro.”
Me, quizzically, “What is milk brobro?”
“No… Milk Bro, bro…”
“WHAT?!”
Long story short, I found out that Milk Bro is a stall at the Geylang Serai Bazaar which serves flaming boba milk with cream mousse and brown sugar. While my editor got a huge slap in the arm for being the biggest retard in the world. ?
Later that evening, we decided to check out the bazaar to see if the hipster grub (like the White Rabbit candy drink) is worth making the trip to Geylang Serai for.
Geylang Serai will be held from 3 May to 5 June 2019, and if you need help to get to Geylang Serai Market, we gotchu fam!

If you’re not here for the food (I don’t know why else you would visit Geylang Serai Bazaar) but if that’s the case, Thai Milk Tea is available for S$2 (700ml) at almost every corner.
