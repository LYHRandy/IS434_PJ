3 min readI’m not much of a shopper, especially when it comes to clothes.
I probably restock my wardrobe once a year and it’s usually during the year-end sales, or whenever I can get my hand on some promo codes.
The latter is particularly useful especially at e-commerce sites like ZALORA, which stocks pretty much everything from Fila T-shirts to Nike sneakers.
In case you’re going, “Is he going to talk about what to buy from ZALORA…?”

No.
I’m probably the least qualified Seedly team member to make sartorial recommendations.
But if you’re looking for ZALORA promo codes and useful hacks to save on your online purchases…

Why Are There So Many Different Types Of ZALORA Promo Codes?
If you’re new to online shopping or just can’t be bothered with it, you’ll probably be wondering why there are so many different types of promo codes.
Here’s why…
In-Store Promo Codes
The ZALORA home page has tonnes of in-store promo codes which you can already apply towards your purchases.
But the problem with these ZALORA promo codes is that they’re usually restricted to certain labels and products.
If these items are what you’re intending to buy, then great. If not, you’ll need to look at ZALORA credit card promo codes, which can be applied on a wider choice of items in order to score a discount off your purchase.
New User Promo Codes

These codes are limited to new users and usually give a pretty substantial discount off your first purchase with little to no minimum spend.
Think of it as a sweetener to get you to make your first purchase.
Naturally, you can only use them once.
Seasonal Promo Codes

These can range from 15% to 25% off with a minimum spend of $80 to $100.
They’re often released in conjunction with events like the Great Singapore Sale, or year-end shopping festivals like 9.9, 10.10, 11.11, Black Friday, Christmas… You get the picture.
If you’re patient (and lucky enough), you’ll usually be able to find some kind of promo code during the various events.
Year-Long Promo Codes

These codes are valid all-year-round and are pretty standard across the various banks. For now, it stands at 15% off with a minimum spend of $100.
Perfect for when there aren’t any valid seasonal promo codes, and you desperately need to buy something like… new underwear.

Hacks To Save Even More When Shopping At ZALORA
Promo codes aside, here are some hacks which I’ve picked up from my wife: the self-professed online shopping guru.
Free Shipping
Here’s how much shipping will cost:



Purchase OrderDelivery Fee
(Standard Shipping)




Below S$40$4.90


S$40 and aboveFree



As long as you meet the minimum spend – after discounts and vouchers are applied – you can qualify for free shipping.
If you find that you’re just under the minimum spend amount, check with your friends or family members if they’re planning to OR want anything off ZALORA. That way you can make the minimum spend and everyone gets to enjoy free shipping!
Note: this is NOT an excuse to “add more stuff coz you want to qualify for free shipping”.
Leave Items In Your Cart
If you can’t decide whether you need that extra pair of sneakers when you have 5,000 pairs at home. Try leaving them in your shopping cart.
Don’t quote me on this but sometimes, you’ll receive an email with a special ZALORA discount code to encourage you to complete your purchase.
This hack is not recommended if the item is particularly popular and has the potential to sell-out.
Note: this only works if you’re a registered user with ZALORA – or any other e-commerce sites for the matter – are logged in and subscribed to the mailing list.
Get Cashback Via ShopBack
Just in case you’re one of the rare few who are STILL unaware of this amazing platform called ShopBack.
Source: ShopBack
It’s a cashback site that gives you cash back simply by clicking through it to get to Zalora. For new customers, you’ll get 9% cashback on your purchase. And for existing customers, you’ll enjoy 4.50% cashback.
Once you’ve accumulated the minimum withdrawal amount, you can withdraw it via PayPal or your preferred bank account.

Maximise Your Rewards Using Credit Cards
Since all transactions take place online, that means you’ll probably need to use a debit or credit card to pay for your purchase.
The best thing about this is that you can choose which card you wish to use in order to clock even more rewards like:

points for redemption
miles for travel
cashback and cash rebates, for erm… cash (duh)
