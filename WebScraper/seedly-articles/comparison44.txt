Dating apps seem to be the solution to this.
With the revolution of smartphones, one can now use dating apps to find their soulmate online. In a way, technology might have helped boosted Singapore’s pathetic fertility rate a little.

Every dating app usually follows a certain pattern when it comes to monetizing:

It is usually free to download and free to use
In-app purchases available to upgrade your account or to buy tokens that can possibly help increase your chance of meeting new people.

With Seedly always on a lookout to help Singaporeans make smarter personal finance decisions, we decide to do a comparison across all dating apps and their features.

Which dating app is the cheapest?

We understand that each dating app is unique in their own way. The mechanism of each dating app is further explained at the bottom of the article.
In this comparison, we lay out a few assumptions:

Each dating app has an equal chance of getting a date.
With each upgrade, the chance of getting a date increases equally.
