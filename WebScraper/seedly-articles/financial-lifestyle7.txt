3 min readEverything is so convenient nowadays. I mean, everything.
Sometimes, I wonder if we will eventually become too lazy, but that’s a conversation for another time.
With so many choices for online grocery shopping and delivery, it’s understandable how some of us may be overwhelmed.
Hopefully, you’ll be able to find the best online grocer that suits your needs, with our comparison of FairPrice On, RedMart, Allforyou (Sheng Siong), Cold Storage, Giant and Amazon Prime Now.

TL;DR – Which Online Grocer Is The Best?

With so many options available nowadays, all 6 services are offering very attractive delivery fees and fast delivery timings.
One of the most important things we look out for when shopping online is delivery fees and online grocery shopping is no exception.

Lowest minimum spend for free delivery: FairPrice On ($39 & above)
Quickest delivery: Amazon Prime Now
Cheapest house brand items: Giant 
Cheapest groceries: Prices & discounts are largely similar across all services

Of course, there are other factors at play when deciding which service you use, but some people might put more focus on delivery fees.

For smaller orders, RedMart offers the lowest delivery fees of $3.99 for orders between $40 – $60.
These services are definitely aware of the competition they have as the delivery fees are largely similar. The lowest minimum spend required to enjoy free delivery goes to FairPrice On and you just have to spend $39 per order!
However, if you prefer to consolidate all your items and do weekly grocery shopping, it should be relatively easier for you to hit the minimum spend, regardless of which service you choose.

Since I’ve only shopped for groceries online once through FairPrice On, I decided to randomly pick items and check out on each store to test out the promise of same-day deliveries.

Based solely on the information gathered above, it seems that RedMart would be your preferred choice for an urgent order since it offers same-day delivery and delivers until 11pm.
Even though it was the most promising, the same-day delivery slots for RedMart were all full for me and I could only choose delivery slots for the next day. In fact, I could only choose the morning slots for the next day as well. Maybe I’m just unlucky? 
On the other hand, Allforyou (Sheng Siong), still had same-day slots available when I tried doing the same before 4pm.
Even though FairPrice On offers only next-day delivery, it was the only one with most slots available for the whole week. Either no one’s buying from them, or they have a really impressive delivery fleet to cater to everyone.
Similarly, all slots suggested by Cold Storage and Giant were available for reserving, so good on them!
Amazon Prime Now is another story on its own, of course, you paid for their services, so their promise for 2-hour delivery definitely reflects when you’re checking out your cart.
But if you’re planning ahead, most of these services allow you to make your purchases a week in advance, which is great for your busy lifestyles!

Of course, our data is not the final verdict as we only chose a few common items for the price comparison.
Most of the items are priced the same or vary very slightly.
When it comes to discounts on the name brands though, they’re either a standard amount of discount across the board, or it varies depending on the store.
I’ve always thought that Sheng Siong has the cheapest prices for common household items, but it really depends on what you’re purchasing.
A quick look tells you that Giant’s house brand items are typically cheaper compared to the other house brands. If you’re simply looking for a good deal and ain’t so particular about taste, Giant’s house brand items will soon become your best friends.
At the end of the day, you’ll have to make your own comparisons when checking out discounts, especially since they can be time-sensitive too.
Apart from prices, another comparison you’d have to make for yourself would be the variety of items available on each service.
If you’re usually buying the same few brands that are available everywhere, then it might not make much of a difference when it comes to FairPrice On, Allforyou and Giant.
But if you’re looking for specific and exclusive brands, then maybe you’re more of a RedMart, Cold Storage or Amazon Prime Now person.

Before you declare any of the above your favourite online grocer, there are still a few things we need to take into consideration.
For instance, will you be using RedMart or Amazon Prime Now often enough to cover their membership fees?

Unless you are an avid user of Lazada and make online purchases often enough to maximise the rebate, $59.90 per year is not going to be super worth it for free delivery for your groceries.
On the other hand, even though Amazon Prime Now does not stock budget grocery items, $2.99 per month is a pretty good deal, considering that you will have access to all other Amazon Prime features.
Or is cashback important to you? Since only FairPrice On and Cold Storage are eligible for cashback through ShopBack when you make your purchase online.

So, what do you think?
Do you have a favourite online grocer?
Or will you be using different services for different needs?
