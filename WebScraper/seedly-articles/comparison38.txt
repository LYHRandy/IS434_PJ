2 min readThe Prudential Marina Bay Carnival is back once again, this time slightly bigger than the previous. Also maybe bigger damage to your pockets.
We are here to show you how much you will end up spending and how much it costs!

We ran a poll on our Instagram and as usual, our followers being prudent as they usually are, said Marina Bay Carnival was not worth their money! (We hope they are not lying to us though!)

For All Carnival Expenses: Credits Exchange Rates and RFID Card
Credits are used at the carnival and transacted using an RFID card, they can be found at any ‘Top Up Credits Here’ counter.

Min. purchase for a new card is 10 credits
S$1 gives you 1 credit
Min. top-up of S$1

You can purchase your credits online and redeem them at the counters in Marina Bay Carnival. The only difference is that you get 10% bonus credits. Let’s use the cheapest example:

For S$40, purchasing online gets you 40 credits & 4 bonus credits
Purchasing at the venue gets you 40 credits only.

This essentially costs you S$0.91 per credit instead of the usual S$1 per credit but you have to be very sure you are going to spend at least S$40 at the carnival.
Note: Bonus credits can only be used for rides and games only.

What is a Prudential Marina Bay Carnival without A Prudential Booth?
I am not sure if they will be selling insurance to you there but I am certain that it’s an air-conditioned booth you can visit for some cool air and you are also able to mail yourself or loved ones, anywhere in the world, a postcard for FREE!
At the very least, how much should you expect to spend?
Since it has no entry fee, you can discipline yourself not to spend anything. If you are there for the views, in other words, “sight-seeing”, you can expect yourself not to spend a single-cent (duh).
Unless you can’t resist grabbing a drink that would minimally cost you S$3.
