A stint in Bloomberg gifted me with a beer belly, which only grew larger when I moved on to become a Professional Trader. Now I turn caffeine into digestible finance-related content. You can contribute your thoughts like Ming Feng here.


3 min readWe will let you in on a little secret. The cost of getting a home in Singapore has officially put marriage on hold for a lot of Singaporeans.
You know how couples are always talking about how getting married involves more than two people? It is true.
The typical scenario of getting married in Singapore
First, you want to get married.

After which, you meet the parents which many times involve holding a wedding banquet.

You went on to hold a wedding banquet, blowing close to S$40,000 for a room full of relatives and friends (many whom you have never spoken to in the past years). 
Of which, you managed to recoup about S$25,000 from all the “Red Packets”.

Your headache does not end there.
While dealing with the organising of the wedding ceremony, the cost of your home is constantly bugging you.
Should you go for a HDB loan of head over to the bank for their home loan packages?
Should you decide to get a mortgage loan from the bank, you are opening doors to the bombardment of advertisements and sales pitch from the banks.

Now fret not. Seedly is here to remove a little bit of a headache from the above equation. In this article, we will help you do a little comparison for all the mortgage loans.
A quick recap: Should I go for HDB Loan or a Bank Loan

Fixed rate vs Floating for your home loan
Having made up your mind to settle for a bank loan, a major consideration will be choosing between a fixed or floating interest rate package.
What Is Fixed rate for mortgage/ housing loans?
For fixed rate packages, the same interest rate is maintained throughout the lock-in period.
Here’s what this means:

During the lock-in period which usually ranges from 1 to 5 years, the interest rate is fixed.
This is regardless of the market condition, even when it is a rising interest rate environment.
After the lock-in period, the interest rate will be converted to a floating interest rate.
This is a good option if interest rates and low and when the buyer wants to budget with certainty over the initial lock-in period.

What is Floating rate for mortgage/housing loans?
As for floating rate, the rate changes from time to time.
Here’s what this means:

The interest rate is influenced by the SIBOR and SOR rate.
In a rising interest rate environment, one may end up paying more for his loan.
Consumers can choose between 1-month, 3-months, 6-months and 12-months SIBOR or SOR rates to peg their interest to.

Which should you choose? Fixed Rate vs Floating Rate
Here are some factors which should influence your decision when it comes to choosing between a fixed rate or a floating rate.
Interest Rate environment

In a rising interest rate environment, a fixed rate mortgage loan will be a better option as we lock our interest rate to the current one. In contrast, in a declining interest rate, a floating rate is better for consumers.

Financial Certainty

For someone who prefers to be certain about the amount he needs to pay for his loans moving forward, a fixed rate mortgage loan offers that certainty.
For someone who understands the market and is more than happy to monitor the fluctuation of SIBOR and SOR rates, a floating rate works best.


Banks are pegging their interest to these rates!
Banks use various benchmark to peg their loan interest rates, this makes comparing of loans even harder!
This will be further demonstrated in the compilation below.
Before we head over to the mess, it is good to understand the different rates bank uses:

SIBOR
SIBOR is defined as the Singapore interbank offered rate. It is based on the interest rates used by banks in Singapore and the rate they charge one another when they borrow from each other.
Loans are pegged in denominations of 1,3,6 and 12 months, depending on the bank.
Board rates
These are rates that are determined by the bank internally.
Fixed Deposit Pegged Rate (FDPR) 
Fixed deposit rates of the bank. Banks usually use the rates between 6 to 12 months instead. Do note that individual bank uses a different name for this. DBS, for example, uses FHR8.
SOR
The effective cost of borrowing in Singapore Dollars synthetically by borrowing USD for the same maturity.
