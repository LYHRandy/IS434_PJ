A stint in Bloomberg gifted me with a beer belly, which only grew larger when I moved on to become a Professional Trader. Now I turn caffeine into digestible finance-related content. You can contribute your thoughts like Ming Feng here.


2 min readTo transfer money overseas can sometimes be a real headache. This is especially so for expats in Singapore where this form of service impacts them the most.
In fact, one can incur a loss everytime they adopt a service to transfer money overseas due to a few reasons:

Every platform charges a possible service or transfer fees
Platforms usually give consumers a less favourable exchange rate to increase their profit margin

For consumers making a huge amount of transaction, the need to optimise cost and fees becomes even more important.
TL;DR – Players in the market: Worldremit, Instarem, TransferWise, SingX, DBS

All the stated players are Registered Remittance Business with the Monetary Authority of Singapore
SingX transfers to 30+ countries worldwide including Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Europe, NZ, Thailand, US, and the UK
Out of the 7 currencies, Instarem has the best rates for 5 currencies namely Indian Rupee (INR), European Euro (EUR), Phillippine Peso (PHP), Indonesian Rupiah (IDR), Malaysian Ringgit (MYR).
Most platforms do not support Chinese Yuan (CNY) except Transferwise, Worldremit and DBS.

Seedly Personal Finance Community’s Insight

Royston Lee: I use Transferwise. No issued so far and would recommend it
Dixon Soo: Just try to use DBS USA REMIT, 0% service charge. I always use it to transfer funds to Gemini.
Royston Cheng: DBS do have one of the better forex rates. However, I’ve been using Transferwise for the last 4 years. I was one of the earlier users. Have never looked back ever since.
Siti Putri: Just do DBS remit same day transfer. I transfer 4-digits too every month from DBS to my interactive broker account to invest. I find the exchange rate reasonable and it is free and 1 day transfer fast.
