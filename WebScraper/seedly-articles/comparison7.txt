A stint in Bloomberg gifted me with a beer belly, which only grew larger when I moved on to become a Professional Trader. Now I turn caffeine into digestible finance-related content. You can contribute your thoughts like Ming Feng here.

Beating inflation is not as difficult as it sounds if you understand some of the investment products available.
The core inflation in Singapore hovers around 1.9% (average for the past 10 years).
Meanwhile, the banks are giving out interest as low as 0.05% on your deposits and savings…
And frankly that is quite pathetic.
So what if you have money that is just lying around and you don’t want to risk investing it?
Why not look at fixed deposit accounts? An low-risk way to grow your money or at least beat inflation…
What Is A Fixed Deposit Account?
Fixed deposit – also known as time deposit accounts – are financial instruments provided by banks that offer a higher interest rate than a regular savings account. The money, however, must stay in the account for a fixed period of time.
Pros And Cons Of Fixed Deposit
Advantages Of Fixed Deposit
Fixed deposit is popular among some Singaporeans due to a few reasons:

Investors technically need not do anything except give up their liquidity for the additional interest rate
Virtually risk-free: Up to $75,000 of the amount is insured by Singapore Deposit Insurance Corporation (SDIC)
Guaranteed returns: By locking up an amount of money, it helps a certain group of people save better
Tax-free interest: The interest you earn from your fixed deposit sum is exempted from tax in Singapore

Disadvantages Of Fixed Deposit
For the additional interest rate, parking your money into a fixed deposit has its cons too:

Less flexibility: You’ll give up the liquidity of your savings for a fixed amount of time, in order to get the interest
Early withdrawal fees: Withdrawing your money before the deposit reaches its maturity date will mean receiving less interest
Minimum deposit amount required: Fixed deposit usually requires a minimum deposit amount of anywhere between $1,000 to $5,000

TL;DR: Which Is The Best Fixed Deposit In Singapore?
To simplify things, we’ve split our comparison into short-term tenors (1, 3 and 12 months) and longer-term tenors (24 months, and 24 months or more), based on investment amounts.
Note: The below figures are based on interest rates for SGD fixed deposits only – and not foreign currencies. We’ve also excluded all ongoing promotions. 
Also, the longer you park your fixed deposit with the bank, the more interest you’ll receive (duh!).
