A stint in Bloomberg gifted me with a beer belly, which only grew larger when I moved on to become a Professional Trader. Now I turn caffeine into digestible finance-related content. You can contribute your thoughts like Ming Feng here.

I chanced upon a conversation between two friends at my neighbourhood Kopitiam recently. One of them, trying to encourage the other to start investing. His suggestion was instantly shot down with the usual, “Don’t want la! Investing is so difficult”.
I cannot help but take a peep at the screen of his Samsung Galaxy which lights up occasionally due to Facebook notifications.
The wallpaper of his phone has this quote plastered all over:

Some Singaporeans can be quite interesting when it comes to the topic of investing.
Many do not find it difficult when it comes to getting the latest phone out in the market.

Neither was it difficult when it comes to weekend brunches, getting that new car or that Gucci handbag.
But when it comes to the topic of investing? Difficult.

We feel some of your pain. A study on consumer procrastination occurs when the barrier to entry is high. The lack of knowledge and possible high outlay of capital required can deter new investors from dipping their toes in the water.
Hence, products that allow Singaporeans to invest a fixed monthly saving can help encourage the habit of investing.
TL;DR: How To Invest Monthly In Singapore With Little Money?
Singaporeans have no lack of options when it comes to platforms to invest a fixed amount every month.

Where Can Singaporeans Invest A Fixed Monthly Savings

 
When we talk about saving that fixed monthly sum of money, the first platform that comes to mind will be the Regular Share Savings (RSS) that some of the banks and brokerage provide.

Regular Shares Savings (RSS) Plan
Before diving into the different RSS plans available in Singapore, we take a look at the pros and cons of RSS plans.
Pros: RSS Plans allow investors to invest a small amount of money every month. Investing in these products when not on an RSS Plan, requires higher initial capital which may deter investors from investing.
Investors on RSS plans can enjoy the advantage of dollar-cost averaging, without having to constantly time the market.
Cons: The cons of RSS Plan is that there is a chance that lump sum investing has a higher chance of higher returns. Investors are also limited to the share counters by their RSS plan provider.
Investors may also experience higher fees if they invest past a certain investment amount.

Dollar-Cost Averaging vs Lump Sum Investment
We understand the common questions most Singaporeans face.
Source: Seedly Community
The usual, I am new to investing, should I jump on lump-sum investment or monthly investment types of questions.

Monthly investment helps Singaporean’s busy lifestyle as we generally do not need to time the market when we do dollar-cost averaging (DCA) with monthly investments. All it takes is the discipline to set aside some money and let the product or platform do its job.
