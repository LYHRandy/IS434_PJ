Which K-Beauty Store Has The Best Membership Perks?

Turning finance into boba-sized pieces. One iced milk boba tea, please! You can contribute your thoughts like Cherie here.


2 min readI wouldn’t say that I follow the trends where K-beauty is dominating in the beauty space. However, I do only own K-beauty products only because it is cheaper.
For example, getting foundation from Innisfree is at least 2 times cheaper than Estée Lauder’s Double Wear Foundation selling at S$70 at Sephora.
All of these K-beauty contribute back to one conglomerate – Amorepacific, pretty cool but if you are a conscious consumer, this is something you could look out for.
Actually, western beauty products are no different because most of them are also under conglomerates such as L’Oreal or Estée Lauder Companies etc.
Here’s a golden rule we should follow, if you don’t buy at least 80% of your products from 1 brand (e.g. Innisfree), it is best to use a marketplace (e.g. Sephora) to get your makeup.
So, who will give me the best membership benefits?
If I purchase my makeup from these K-Beauty stores with memberships programs, in this case, it would be…
1 BB cushion, 1 blush, 1 lipstick
Anyway, that is enough to come up with a Korean look! Let’s see…

Etude House
So it is e-tude house or aeh-tude house? I’m assuming the latter because attitude. (Y’know? I hope someone gets it.)
They provide with a myriad of products from skincare to makeup, even shampoo at quite affordable prices.
[Verdict] They do give out membership discounts occasionally, even if I don’t shop at Etude House often, I would still hold on to their membership for those discounts.
Etude House is also sold on Lazada which gives 5% rebate if you are a LiveUp member (with an annual subscription fee).

Innisfree
I really enjoy Innisfree products, from scents to makeup and even nail polishes. They are really affordable although they don’t drop discounts very often.
[Verdict] BUT, I feel holding onto their membership is a lil pointless unless you spend S$50 above every visit to get their “free gift”.
Unless you have a lot of empty bottles to recycle to get S$1 (per bottle) worth of points credited into your membership. My skincare turnover rate is really low, so before I could earn S$2, my points would’ve expired.
Innisfree is also sold on Lazada which gives 5% rebate if you are a LiveUp member.

LANEIGE
To be honest, if your skin is really dry and flaking, I swear by Laneige’s Sleeping Mask. LOVE IT. However, I usually get them at iShopChangi, Changi’s Duty-Free store or get my friends to get them for me.
[Verdict] 20% discount on my birthday sounds really enticing for me to just hold on to the membership and sit on it till September comes. Wake me up when September comes?
LANEIGE is also sold on Sephora, Lazada and TANGS.

Sulwhasoo
They are the LA MER of K-beauty. They are not really popular with the masses mainly because of their heavy price tag. And with the goddess, Song Hye-kyo, as the face of Sulwhasoo, we know where they are getting at.
[Verdict] If I can sign up for a membership on my birthday month, and get a 10% discount for the item I bought plus a birthday gift for myself from Sulwhasoo. WHY NOT?
