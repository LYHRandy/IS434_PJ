Conclusion – Making better financial decision

Finding out your TV preference can help you save money. Eg. if you are not a fan of basic channels, going on a genre-specific package can save you a lot of money.
For millennials, they prefer to have full control over the content they watch, which makes platforms like Netflix more popular.
Plus, Netflix is a lot cheaper compared to paid TV services

As long as SingTel holds a monopoly on Barclay’s Premier League rights with little intervention from the government, it will always be a disadvantage on Barclay Premier League football fans.
