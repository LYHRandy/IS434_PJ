The World Of Luxury Banking

Most of my expenditure is on sustenance. Yes, I meant food. You can contribute your thoughts like Junel here.


2 min readFor the crazy rich, all that glitters is gold. “Private banking” brands the elite and nothing screams affluence more than having an account with UBS. Why do we need to know all of this? I guess we don’t, but sometimes we can’t help but to be a bit kaypoh. Plus you never know, you may strike 4D one day.
The Singaporean median household income is $8,846. 12.4% of these are households who earn $20,000 and above a month. That’s a sizeable percentage considering our 5.61 Million large population today. To qualify for private priority banking and not just priority banking, it takes at least $1 Million AUM.
What Is AUM?
Assets Under Management (AUM) is the total value of assets you have with a bank or investment company. This may include bank deposits, money in your savings account, personal investments, mutual funds, fixed deposits and so on. The higher the AUM, the more wealthy you are. 
Who is an example of a person with $5 Million AUM? These people are typically business Owners, MNCs Executives, Investors, Inheritors of large fortune, and so on. They need to have $5 Million in cash and investments.
Private Banking Is Not Priority Banking

Take for example DBS treasures and DBS Private Banking. To be a priority banking client at DBS Treasures, you have to hit a minimum requirement of $350,000 AUM. However, to be a DBS Treasures Private Banking Client, you have to hit a minimum sum of about $3 Million.
Priority banking is categorised under retail banking. It provides you with advisory services, VIP access to certain places, travel privileges and so on.
However, private banking provides a highly personalized level of banking services to High Net Worth Individuals. At this level, it provides networking opportunities with other global private clients, discretionary portfolio management, personalised wealth management and so on.

For a reference, this is the kind of money you need to have
