A stint in Bloomberg gifted me with a beer belly, which only grew larger when I moved on to become a Professional Trader. Now I turn caffeine into digestible finance-related content. You can contribute your thoughts like Ming Feng here.

Things to take note of:
The demand for flower delivery tends to sky-rocket during the period Valentine’s Day.
Valentine’s Day means good business for florists. With an exponential increase in demand, it pushes the logistic management of the florists to the extreme.
For consumers, here are a few things to take note of, to prevent huge disappointment on Valentine’s Day:

Having a positive experience with a certain florist on non-Valentine’s day does not necessarily equate to their ability to handle Valentine’s Day. Look up reviews and their past track record to help you make a better decision.
Most people will be celebrating Valentine’s day on the 14 February itself. Celebrating early can help reduce the risk of late flower delivery.
Understanding the business model of certain florist works too. Eg. I personally understand that Bloomen will only accept the number of orders he can handle.
Spend within your means! There is no reason to be blowing your month’s budget just for Valentine’s Day!
Each florist has their unique selling point, be it affordability or their artisan design, find the one that suits your message the most!
