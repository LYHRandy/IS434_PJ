Greatest Misconception Amongst Singaporeans
Here’s one of the greatest misconception amongst Singaporeans.
” I need to save up a huge amount to be able to start investing.”
This is true in the past when one requires quite a substantial amount of capital before making his or her first investment. However, with the Regular Shares Savings (RSS) Plan, that argument is no longer valid.
With as little as $100 month, average Singaporeans with little to no knowledge of investing can begin their investment journey.

What Is A Regular Shares Savings Plan?
A Regular Shares Savings (RSS) Plan allows one to invest a fixed amount into a variety of Singapore blue-chip stocks or an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that tracks the Straits Times Index (STI).
By allowing a constant monthly investment, the RSS Plan allows an investor to dollar-cost average their investment. When prices of the stocks are low, the investor will automatically be purchasing more with his fixed amount of investment. Conversely, lesser, when stock prices are high.
The RSS Plan is designed for long-term investors and arguably, the best solution for average Singaporeans who do not yet have the knowledge, discipline, and patience to monitor the stock market closely.
It is also one of the recommended options for investors who are new to investing.
