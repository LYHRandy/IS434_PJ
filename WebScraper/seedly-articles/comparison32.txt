When it comes to online shopping, Singaporeans are now the second biggest cross-border online shoppers in Asia-Pacific.
We are currently at 3.12 million online shoppers in Singapore. And this number is projected to increase to 4.11 million by the year 2021, with each online shopper spending an average of $1,662.
Unsurprisingly, 74% of Singaporean shoppers are using credit cards for their online shopping needs. Naturally, this increases the importance of promo codes and credit card promotions when it comes to online shopping.

How Much Should You Be Spending Online?
To determine if you are spending too much on your online shopping “addiction”, here’s a quick guideline for you.

Based on our basic budgeting guideline, the only place where expenses for online shopping can come from is the flexible or wealth portion of your salary allocation.
Why? Because the 50% allocation to expenses is to take care of any “basic needs” you have, whereas online shopping is a “want”. The 20% savings component should be an untouchable resource because it’s purely for rainy days.
So… The only place where your online shopping budget can come out from is the 30% allocated to wealth buidling. Which also means that it’s really up to YOU to weigh your priorities for the month.
Because for every one dollar you spend on online shopping, that’s one dollar you forgo which can be put into investments.
Simply put, if you ever find your online spending to be more than 30% of your take-home salary, maybe it’s time to relook your shopping habits.
