A stint in Bloomberg gifted me with a beer belly, which only grew larger when I moved on to become a Professional Trader. Now I turn caffeine into digestible finance-related content. You can contribute your thoughts like Ming Feng here.


6 min readBreaking News: Electricity Tariff To Fall Next Quarter
Good news everyone!
If you haven’t heard, electricity tariffs are set to decrease by an average of 3.3 per cent, or 0.79 cent per kilowatt hour (kWh) after rising to a near five-year high in the previous quarter. 

It’s not the sexiest piece of news EVER.
But if you’re paying the electricity bills, this is kind of like striking 4D.
I exaggerate, of course.
We’re not sure if the open electricity market will factor this announcement into their prices and drop them accordingly.
But if you haven’t switched to one yet, why not push your utility bills down even further by switching now? Or help your parents to do so if they haven’t switched.
That way, they won’t be nagging at you to switch off the lights when you leave the room or complain about the rising utility bill because you’re gaming late into the night.
See… EVERYONE WINS.
Disclaimer: we’re not sponsored by any of the open electricity retailers, we’ve simply done the comparison and it simply makes sense to switch!

If there’s one thing that Singaporeans care deeply about, it’s saving money.

How Much Do Singaporeans Spend On Electricity Every Month?
Singaporeans are subjected to Electricity Tariff, which is regulated by the Energy Market Authority (EMA).
For Q4 2019 (1 Oct to 31 Dec 2019), the electricity tariff is 23.43 cents per kWh (excluding GST).
The Electricity Tariff is made up of 4 main components:



Electricity Tariff ComponentsPriceHow Often Is It Reviewed?




Market Administration and Power System Operation Fee

(Paid to Energy Company and Power System Operator)0.06 cents/kWhAnnually


Market Support Services Fee (MSS)0.40 cents/kWhAnnually


Network Cost5.44 cents/kWhAnnually


Energy Costs17.53 cents/kWhQuarterly

The sum of the 4 components makes up your Electricity Tariff, which will be what the consumer pays for their monthly electricity bill.

To make comparison easier for everyone, we are going to focus on what matters the most: residential plans.

Types Of Open Electricity Market (OEM) Residential Plans
There are three types of OEM residential plans.
Note: in case you’re wondering, the 22.15 cents/kWh (before GST) electricity tariff is just for illustration
Standard: Fixed Price Plan

This means that you’ll pay a fixed rate throughout your contract.
Standard: Discount Off The Regulated Tariff Plan

This plan lets you enjoy a percentage off the EMA Regulated Electricity Tariff, throughout your contract. So pray that the tariff decreases every quarter.
Non-Standard: Peak And Off-Peak Plan

These plan is pretty self-explanatory. You’ll pay more during peak period, and you’ll pay less during off-peak period. Great for people who work (or game) at home during off-peak periods.

Which Electricity Retailer’s Fixed Price Plan Is The Cheapest?
With 12 retailers, choosing one can be quite a chore, but we are here to help by comparing all the plans they have for households.
In general, we noted that in general Fixed Price Plans are cheaper than what you would pay for if you’re paying SP based on the current electricity tariff.

Which Electricity Retailer’s Peak And Off-Peak Plan Is The Cheapest?

Not many retailers offer this as consumers would have to get an extra meter installed to monitor electricity activity.

Some Commonly Asked Questions About The OEM
1. Why Are Electricity Retailers Able Charge Lower For Electricity Than SP Group?
You’re probably going, “WALAO, has SP Group been overcharging me ALL THESE YEARS?!”
Not exactly.
The regulated tariff takes into account the cost of producing and delivering electricity which includes the cost of building and operating power plants as well as maintaining the power grid.
The rates offered by retailers, on the other hand, reflect current market conditions and the short-term costs of producing electricity.
If the current market conditions see excess in supply as compared to demand, the price of electricity will naturally be lower.
These retailers can then go into the wholesale market and buy electricity in bulk from power generation companies.
Of course, these prices offered by retailers are only fixed during your contract. So they can adjust their prices and discounts over time. But fret not, you can always switch back to buying electricity at the regulated tariff from SP Group at any time – after you complete your contract of course; unless you wish to pay the early termination fee…
2. When Can I Start Applying?
As of today, you can switch to an Open Electricity Market retailer anytime.
But as with anything that has to do with money, take the time to understand the OEM before you switch.
The retailers might be throwing promo codes around like Oprah Winfrey and shouting out how they’re the cheapest in town.

But you really should take the time to understand the other stuff which electricity retailers don’t usually talk about like:

Administrative fee
AMI meter installation fee
Auto-renewal of contract clause
Carbon tax
Early termination charges
Late payment fee
Paper bill
Security deposit
Transmission loss factor
U-Save GST Voucher

3. What Is Transmission Loss Factors (TLF)
To put it simply, it’s a scaling factor that has been applied at the metering point to account for network and transformer loss.
Think of it this way: to get you one unit of electricity, the retailer needs to send two units of electricity to account for the possible loss of one unit of electricity when electricity travels across such a vast distance from the power plant to your home. That’s the TLF that they need to factor in when charging you.
Most of us fall under the 230kv/400kV load.

SP Group should have already adjusted this to reflect the actual consumer use, so retailers will adhere to SP Group’s recommended TLF and bill you accordingly.
