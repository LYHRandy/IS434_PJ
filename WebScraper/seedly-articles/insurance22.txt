Deductibles & Co-Insurance
Integrated Shield Plans works a little like Car Insurance, where it is required of you to pay an excess first before the insurer comes in to take over the rest of the payments. It is very similar to making a “downpayment”.
Similarly, for Integrated Shield Plan, you are required to pay a sum of money first called deductibles and co-insurance before the insurer covers the rest of your hospital bill.

Deductibles
All 6 insurers have the same deductible of $3,500 if you were admitted to a Private Hospital.
You are required to pay the first $3,500 of the bill before the insurer steps in.
Co-insurance
This comes in after the deduction of $3,500 from your bill.
For all 6 insurers, you are required to pay the next 10% of the bill before the insurer steps in.
Integrated Shield Plan Riders
You are able to cover about ~80% of the deductibles and co-insurance if you add on riders for yourself at an additional cost.

Premiums of various Integrated Shield Plan

Payable by CPF Medisave Account up to the Medisave withdrawal limit
Premiums increase with every few years age band from 20 years old onwards.
In short, your premiums to get more expensive as you get older.

In this case, we will be looking at premiums for age 26 to 30,

Commonly Asked Questions or FAQs
I have Company Insurance, do I still need this?
It depends.

Integrated Shield Plan covers you for a lifetime.
Your company insurance covers you for as long as you stay with the company. Unless your company offers Portable Medical Insurance.

If you are required to claim and have no Integrated Shield Plan on your own,

Still able to get covered by the company.
In future, when purchasing an Integrated Shield Plan for yourself, your condition that you claimed for previously might get excluded.

Should I get an Integrated Shield Plan?
Yes if you answered ‘Yes’ to these few questions:

Do you want to stay in a Private Hospital or Public Hospital Class A/B1 wards?
Do you wish to choose your own doctor?
Can you afford your premiums in the long term?
Premiums increase periodically as you get older. It is also possible to downgrade your plan (e.g. from ‘Private Hospital’ plan to ‘Public Hospital Class B1 Ward’ plan).

What Now?
Now that you have seen the benefits across 6 Integrated Shield Plan Providers, I hope that this will help you make a wise decision if you have not gotten one for yourself.
If you are holding onto an existing Integrated Shield Plan and you wish to make a change, do note that you will be exposed to the new co-payment feature that MOH had rolled out in March 2018. This co-payment feature will be inforce from April 2021 onwards.

Only If You Are Healthy

Integrated Shield Plan policies will be accepted only if you are healthy.
(There are some insurers that will insure you for your pre-existing if you have not visited the hospital for the same pre-existing condition)
If not, your plan will either be rejected or the insurer would exclude your existing condition.
In other words, do not switch plans if your current plan covers your pre-existing condition.

Do discuss your needs with a financial advisor that you can trust. Most importantly, stay healthy! I’ll see you in the next one, till then!
