A stint in Bloomberg gifted me with a beer belly, which only grew larger when I moved on to become a Professional Trader. Now I turn caffeine into digestible finance-related content. You can contribute your thoughts like Ming Feng here.


4 min readYou Should Definitely Switch To A SIM Only Mobile Plan 
Updated 10 September 2019. Not kidding! We ARE stalking the telcos.
It may be convenient to extend our telco plan every time it becomes available for a re-contract, but did you know that switching to a SIM-only mobile plan helps you save money and gives you the freedom of choice for the next two years?
With so many new telcos and SIM Only plans coming up, Singaporeans should take this opportunity to save more on their mobile phone bill while the Mobile Network Operators (MNO) – like Singtel, Starhub, and M1 – and Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNO) – like Giga, GOMO, and Circles.Life – engage in a price war!

 
And while the price is a huge factor that influences which telco we choose, the rise of so many MVNOs in the market also means that Singaporeans should pay attention to which network they are on.
This is important because not only should our plans be the cheapest, but they should at least provide us with reception and service wherever we go.
If not, what’s the point of switching?
But seriously… So many telcos how to choose sia?

As of our last count, customers can choose from 13 telcos in the market.
For a small population, this much competition is great news for us. The more the telcos engage in a price war, the more benefits we as consumers will get.

Why Are SIM-Only Plans So Much Cheaper?
Since every telco has a SIM-only mobile plan which costs way lesser than a traditional two-year mobile plan, a lot of people are probably wondering, “Why so good?”
And also, “Why are virtual telcos able to sell SIM-only plans at such low prices?”
Here’s why…
Singapore Telcos And The Network Which They Are On
There are three major mobile network operators (MNOs) in Singapore, namely:

Singtel
Starhub
M1

Over the years, we have seen a neverending stream of mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) popping up to ‘disrupt the market’ with their SIM-only plans.
Here are the virtual telcos available in the market right now:

VIVIFI
MyRepublic
Zero1
Grid mobile
TPG Mobile
giga!
GOMO
redONE
Circles.Life
Zero Mobile

The reason the MVNOs can afford to price their SIM-only plans so low is because:

They aren’t paying to maintain their own network (they’re essentially buying bandwidth from the current MNOs and re-selling it to you)
They also generally spend less on marketing
They do not need to maintain a physical store presence (meaning they save on rent)

But, even though price is one thing to consider when switching, it’s probably equally if not more important to choose an MVNO which is tapping on a reliable MNO’s network.
Here’s a look at who’s on which network:

Which Telco Has The Best Reception?

Re-Contracting May Be An Overpriced 2-Year Phone Payment Scam
So you have a traditional two-year mobile plan that is nearing the end of your contract.
You’re probably thinking:

It’s the best (and probably the only deal) you know
It’s the first mobile plan you started with so it’s convenient to just renew it
Re-contracting on a two-year mobile plan comes with an attractive discount off the latest mobile phones

STOP.
The harsh truth is that the upfront ‘discount’ which telcos offer on a new mobile phone, is probably recollected by tagging a small monthly premium on your monthly phone bill across your two-year mobile plan.
The MNOs know this.
And in the face of MVNO entrants, the bigger boys like Singtel, Starhub, and M1 have begun slashing prices on their data plans and rethinking their marketing towards you – the consumer.

The SIM Only Plan And Phone From Carousell Strategy
With data as the main priority for most of us getting a mobile plan, we have a simple strategy.
Simply get a SIM-Only plan which gives you the same amount of data you currently enjoy on your two-year contracts (or more data since it’s probably cheaper as a SIM only plan).
Next, head over to a marketplace like Carousell to buy your preferred mobile phone.
We did a little comparison with regard to going on a StarHub two-year plan with the re-contract price of the phone, and compared it with someone on a SIM Only plan and getting his phone through Carousell.



 Total Cost Of Mobile Plan After 2 YearsCost Of Samsung Galaxy S9 64GBTotal Cost Over 2 Years




StarHub Contract Plan
(3Gb, 200 Mins)$1,152
($48 per month)$649
(recontract)$1,801


StarHub Cheapest SIM Only Plan
(No Contract, 15GB, 100mins)$600
($25 per month)$1,050
(Carousell)$1,650
(and a lot more data)



The total amount of savings? $151 over 2 years, and WAY more mobile data.

Conclusion? Switch To SIM ONLY
In conclusion, we hope that this simple hack has taught you how to save you a ton of money and you now know it is definitely worth marking down the date on your calendar, the moment your current two-year contract ends.
Our whole team has jumped on and we have been spreading the word around.
If you wish to save more, remember to choose the most economical fibre broadband plan too!
