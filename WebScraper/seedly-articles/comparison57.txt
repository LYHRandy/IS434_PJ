3 min readAnd I. Don’t worry, I am as lazy as you can be too. Being a lazy ass, heading to a regular gym to work out on my own is a huge feat for me.
I would take a Hai Di Lao feast over working out ANYTIME! Okay, Hai Di Lao might be a skewed comparison choice, but you get the gist.

I have noticed that many of my friends taking up a fitness pass to get into yoga, Zumba, aqua-cycling class, not sure if it is a working adult thing to do (#adulting) or everyone just wants to keep fit.
I feel super FOMO whenever I view my Instagram stories of them being active in their activewear, I want to keep fit too!
“FOMO” stands for Fear of missing out!
