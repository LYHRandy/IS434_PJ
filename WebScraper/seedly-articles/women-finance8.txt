3 min readWhat is Human Papillomavirus (HPV)?
HPV is a group of common viruses that cause infections in both men and women.
With more than 150 related viruses, each virus is given a number (HPV type). HPV is transmitted through intimate skin-to-skin contact, and most infected persons do not show any signs of symptoms.

Is HPV common in Singapore?
Yes, 8 out of 10 people will get HPV at some point in their lifetime as reported by the Singapore Cancer Society, it is the 10th most common cancer in women.
Though HPV infections clear up on their own and generally do not cause any problems. However, infections sometimes will not go away. These persistent infections by certain HPV types can cause cancer and other diseases over time.

What can HPV infections cause?



HPV TypesDiseases / Cancer causedAffected Gender




6 and 11Genital wartsMale, Female


16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58
(High-risk)Cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancersFemale


Anal, penile cancerMale



Yes, it does affect males as well. I know it has been heavily marketed as prevention for cervical cancer but HPV vaccines can prevent males from genital warts, anal cancer etc.
If more men were to be vaccinated, it reduces the risk of transmission of HPV to women – who possess a higher risk of life-threatening cancers once infected. Also, as more women get vaccinated, it also reduces the man’s risk of HPV related diseases as mentioned above.
As it is uncommon for men to seek HPV preventions, they are unable to use their Medisave for any HPV vaccinations.

3 Types of HPV Gardasil Vaccines



 HPV VaccinationsProtect Against HPV Types




1Cervarix*16, 18


2Gardasil 4 / HPV 46, 11, 16, 18


3Gardasil 9 / HPV 96, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58



*Cervarix is only approved for use in women and girls.

Gardasil 4 reduces your risk of cervical cancer to 30%
Gardasil 9 reduces your risk of cervical cancer to 10%

Gardasil 9 is much more effective but also since it is new, it is currently not Medisave-claimable.
According to a doctor – I’ve asked, he told me that if you are not sexually active or if you only plan to have 1 partner, Gardasil 4 would be sufficient and it is Medisave-claimable. 
That recommendation would most likely be according to my lifestyle and needs. Most importantly, do seek your doctor’s opinion and recommendation before making your decision on which dosage you should go for.

How much is HPV vaccine in Singapore?

HPV vaccines range from S$300 to S$800
Medisave-claimable up to S$400 (For Cervarix and Gardasil 4 only)

According to The Straits Times, many of us are still not keen on getting vaccinated, despite HPV vaccines being around in Singapore for over a decade.
If only people are aware of the ridiculously EXPENSIVE cancer treatment costs in Singapore… I’m sure they would be willing to fork out a seemingly small amount of money for the HPV vaccines instead.

Is HPV vaccine necessary?
No, HPV vaccines are not compulsory but they are recommended as prevention. HPV vaccines work best before you have started having sex or sexual activity.
Even if you have started having sex or sexual activity, you can still be protected against the other types of HPV that you have not been exposed to.
You should still undergo routine cervical cancer screening via a Pap smear test every 3 years even after you have been vaccinated especially if

You are sexually active
Above the age of 25

It is important to seek a professional doctor for advice before deciding if HPV vaccinations are suitable for you.
(NEW IN) Free opt-in cervical cancer vaccine for female Sec 1 students from Apr 2019
From April 2019, all female Secondary 1 students who are Singaporean or permanent residents will be able to opt-in for a one-time free vaccination to protect them against cervical cancer. Those of similar age who are studying in private educational institutes will also be offered the fully-subsided vaccination.
The Ministry of Health (MOH) also announced that it will adopt a more accurate cervical cancer test which will allow women to test every five years instead of three. These measures are part of MOH’s move towards increasing disease prevention so as to reduce the strain on healthcare services in the future.
