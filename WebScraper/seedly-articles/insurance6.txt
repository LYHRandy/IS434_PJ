2 min readHealth truly is wealth. That’s why health screening is of such importance, and even companies are helping to arrange for employees to receive complimentary basic annual health screening.

The truth is – sickness may strike anytime, but if a disease or condition is discovered early through routine screening, receiving treatment early would help immensely in avoiding complications, much suffering or even death.
Health screenings consist of tests like blood or urine tests and other procedures like X-rays and ultrasounds.
Take note that while some packages are offered at very affordable prices, always be sure to check what each package entails and choose one that best suits your age, lifestyle and health concerns, especially in lieu of hereditary health conditions.
