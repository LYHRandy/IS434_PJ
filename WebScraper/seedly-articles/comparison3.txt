Revolut (vs YouTrip): Everything You Need To Know

3rd October 2019 

Lactose-intolerant, but also BS-intolerant. Having written for the likes of Marina Bay Sands and Time Out, I now spend my days saving up for my stationery shop retirement dream. You can contribute your thoughts like Rebecca here.

The multi-currency war is fast heating up – and the latest player to launch in Singapore is Revolut, a London-based fintech firm.
Like YouTrip, Revolut users can transact and transfer money with zero transaction fees and exchange rate fees. 
We’re proud to say some of our top contributors were at the launch of the Revolut VISA card at a closed-door Seedly x Revolut event on Oct 2, 2019 – during which time users were given an overview of the digital-only bank and led through a Q&A session.

But never mind if you weren’t there; here’s everything you need to know about the challenger bank, and where it stands against YouTrip.
In coming months, another two multi-currency competitors will be launching in Singapore: InstaReM and TransferWise, which you can read more about here.
What is Revolut?
Revolut is a digital-only bank (aka challenger bank) that was launched in 2015 by former investment banker Nik Storonsky and ex-Credit Suisse trader Vlad Yatsenko.
With over 8 million users in Europe and Australia, the banking disruptor is looking to expand into 24 markets, backed by a deal with Visa Inc.

It’s pretty big news, because Revolut aims to be more than a travel card – which customers might expectedly (or initially) think of it as.
Collectively, around 75% of  Revolut cards will be Visa-branded.
At present, here’s what the namesake app offers:

Global transactions in over 150 currencies (commission-free, real-time exchange rates)
No fees in 14 fiat-holding currencies
International money transfers in 27 currencies
Overseas ATM withdrawals (capped at $350 for Standard members)
Built-in budgeting and P2P payment options
Vaults to manage your savings
Physical and virtual cards, and disposable virtual cards
Lounge KeyPass (access to airport business lounges around the world)

The Revolut Set-Up Process
Setting up was a quick five-minute process for me:

Enter your phone number
Set your password and enter a 6-digit code
Fill out your name, date of birth and address
Take a photo of your IC (front and back)
Take a selfie
Allow time for verification
You’re in!


Some things to note:

Photo verification: You can only take photos in real-time; there isn’t the option of pulling up images from your gallery.
Verification time: Within around 7 minutes of uploading the required images, I got a notification alerting me I’d been verified.
A minimum top-up amount of $20 is required.

Revolut Membership Options
Presently, the card offers three membership tiers: Standard, Premium and Metal. 
Here’s what each tier offers:

What’s The Difference Between A Physical Card and Virtual Card?
“If you can have a virtual card, what’s the point of a physical card?” was my question to Revolut’s Growth Launcher, Sarveen Chester.

Here’s a quick look at the key differences between the physical card and virtual card:
Physical card:

Online and offline transactions
Doubles as a transport card
Location-based security

Virtual card:

Online transactions only
Split payments allowed; up to five virtual cards per month, each of which can be used in specific areas (e.g. Spotify subscription/car loan/plane tickets, etc.)
Standard members enjoy one free virtual card (it’s S$9 per virtual card subsequently); Premium and Metal members enjoy unlimited virtual cards. 

Disposable virtual card:

For one-time use (no fees to order disposable virtual card); self-destructs upon successful transaction
Prevents risk of fraud, hacking

The disposable virtual card is a clever one, particularly for one-off purchases. I know far too many friends who’ve fallen prey to fraud after unknowingly saving their credit card details, or making a transaction with slightly dodgy merchants.
It’s essentially Snapchat, but way more useful.
The Revolut Vault 
Unlike YouTrip, Revolut offers various options for personal and group savings goals. 

Here’s where it gets interesting: you’ve the option of creating multiple vaults for each of your goals – whether a holiday to Europe or monthly HDB loans.
You’ll also be able to set an end date for each of your goals. The spare change option expedites the saving process; every transaction made is rounded up, and the difference deposited in your vault.
So if you’ve spent $3.40  on bubble tea, the difference – 60 cents – will be placed in your vault.
The group savings vault works in a similar manner: set monetary group goals for areas spanning leisure and bills, then add contributing members (they’ll first have to be on Revolut, though).
While I haven’t had the chance to fully utilise the Vault, time will tell – so watch this space.
How Does Revolut Compare Against YouTrip?
If you’re a YouTrip user, you’d likely regard it as a travel card. You’re not wrong, although the multi-currency player has plans to introduce insurance and remittance services eventually.
Here’s a look at how Revolut and YouTrip compare:

At time of my comparison, Revolut offered better (albeit minute) real-time rates.
Unless you regularly exchange foreign currencies – and in large sums – Revolut’s rates are unlikely to incentivise YouTrip fans to make the switch…at least, in this respect.
Final Thoughts: Revolut VS YouTrip
Both Revolut and YouTrip operate with a similar goal: to simplify travelling and trim the excess by transacting in real time (goodbye, hefty fees!).
But that’s also where the similarities end.

Some things I thoroughly enjoy about the Revolut app thus far: the fairly customisable Vault, the ability to enjoy commission-free rates (and observe real-time fluctuations of interbank exchange rates), and how much control I have within the eco-system.
From budgeting to trading, it’s brimming with potential and has all the makings of a well-rounded app.
YouTrip operates primarily as a consumer travel card, and dominates the Singapore market at present – oweing to the fact that it was the first digital bank to launch in Singapore in 2018. I also like how it can be used as an EZ Link card without a minimum top-up value.
The differences between Revolut’s physical and virtual cards are minimal. Unless you fancy using your physical Revolut card for transport, I imagine most users would prefer sticking to using their existing Visa- or Mastercard-enabled cards on a day-to-day.
Frequent business/leisure travellers – or anyone who regularly makes remittance transfers – might appreciate Premium and Metal membership perks. Otherwise, Revolut’s Standard (aka free!) membership would suffice.
