11 min readAre you a frenzied couple looking for a wedding photographer or wedding videographer while planning for your wedding now?
No worries. For you have come to the right place!
Apart from giving you a holistic view of actual day wedding and videography rates in Singapore, I will also be breaking down the nuances and things to look out for when selecting your vendor in this seemingly inflated market. I mean c’mon… It seems like if you throw the word ‘wedding’ in front of any service, the price tag suddenly doubles or triples – and that’s just simply because of the way the industry has been marketed!
P.S. This compilation is for actual day rates. Not the pre-wedding shoot rates. But don’t worry I’ll come up with that piece soon as well, so stay tuned!
Pictured above: One of my favourite pictures from our pre-wed shoot by @andy.amattayakul
A quick disclaimer: this piece is non-sponsored and basically a compilation of vendors who made the first cut for us, in terms of style and portfolio. We prefer photos which are not too over-exposed and either cleaner or darker tones, looking through reviews on online forums.
(Edit: We’ve made some changes like removing Allure Weddings and French Toast Productions after increasingly bad reviews from both the Seedly community and Budget Brides community. Thanks!) 

TL;DR: How Much Does It Cost To Hire Both An Actual Day Wedding Photographer And Videographer?

Actual Day Wedding Photography (10 hours) would cost between $1,800 to $3,000
Actual Day Wedding Videography (10 hours) would cost between $1,888 to $4,000
If you’ve a budget to stick to, look out for vendors who offer a photography and videography bundle (they might offer a discount!)
Alternatively, some wedding photographers will also partner wedding videographers to offer discounts

All in all, if you’re getting married in 2019/2020 expect to pay between $3,500 to $5,000 for BOTH actual day wedding photography and wedding videography services.

Thank You Budget Brides Singapore FB Group!
Before I go any further, I just want to give a big shoutout to the Facebook group: Budget Brides Singapore! The power of their collective wisdom has been a really useful tool for my fianceé and many other Brides-To-Be (BTB)s in making smarter decisions when planning for their big day. Only ladies are allowed to join the group though.
How Far Ahead Should You Start Looking For An Actual Day Wedding Photographer (PG) And Videographer (VG)?
To give credit where it’s due, this article is only possible due to the compilation of research done by my soon-to-be-wife, who spent countless weekends and weeknights sending out emails to these providers to get the quotes for our wedding in 2020.
Pictured above: This is what you’ll probably do when it comes to finding your ideal photographer and videographer
For us, we’re getting married on a pretty ‘hot date’ next year. Dates like 8 August 2020 (08.08.20) and 10 October 2020 (10.10.20).
Many of these hot dates also fall coincidentally on a Saturday, which is when most people would have their weddings.
This also means that many of the popular photographers and videographers would already have been booked at least a year in advance.
Here Is A 3 Step Process On How To Choose Your Actual Day PG And VG
I know you’re reading this on Seedly, and yes, naturally you would assume that cost is all that matters when it comes to choosing your PG and VG. However, it is actually one out of three very important steps:

Choose your style based on their portfolio and past work
Read reviews on either the forums, groups and their pages (some are really horrendous)
Finally decide based on the cost and how much budget you have

The reason why I would indicate cost as step 3 is that (as much as I hate to say this…) it’s true that this is a once in a lifetime thing and you would REALLY want to have nice pictures of your big day. There are angles, lighting, and a huge amount of work in editing and post-production just to get the right look and feel of those captured moments.
If not, with today’s power of the latest smartphone, you could theoretically get your brothers or sisters to help you take some photos! But trust me, they’re really not the same…

4) Andre Tei Photography


It’s strange how my journey in wedding photography began – it all started with the need to earn some pocket money as a broke engineering student. Coming from a landscape and street photography background (the latter which I still love and do), the intimacy of wedding photography felt a little foreign to me. That was nine years ago.
Since then, I’ve been blessed to witness some of the most genuine and heartfelt moments one could bear witness to – the anxiety of the groom before seeing his bride, a proud father walking his daughter down aisle, people from different cultural/ethnic backgrounds vowing to commit to each other – these moments are such a privilege to be a part of. What’s most important to me is capturing the essence of your wedding, its story and soul. I believe in finding beauty in unlikely places, amid the laughter and the tears, but most of all, in giving you a memory of a day that reflects who you are.

17) Happy Photo People


What I love most about photographs is that they capture a moment that’s gone forever, into tangible prints – allowing us to revisit the moment again, and to tell a story with the photographs.
To me, a good photograph is not only one which highlights the skills of the photographer or the beauty of the models. Rather, it is one which captures the genuine connection between the people photographed. I like photographs that are simple and direct. In each photoshoot, I try to create a fun and relaxed environment for my clients to be as comfortable as possible, while I capture their moments the best way I can.

25) Hong Ray Photography


When it comes to photography, there is nothing I do with more pleasure and passion. I consider myself very lucky that my job is also my beloved hobby. I started to enjoy taking pictures ever since I was a child. When the first mobile phone with a camera appeared, around when I was 14 years old, it felt hard to take my eyes, and hands, off it.
Because I also loved blogging, I thought about entwining the two of them, the results being my very first photography website. Among the photos I posted there, there were a couple of images I took at one of my relative’s wedding. To my surprise, that got me a lot of attention, so when I was just 18 years old, I received my first real assignment as a wedding photographer.
