1. Wilmar derives revenue from four key segments: Tropical Oils, Oilseeds and Grains, Sugar, and Others (Fertiliser & Ship-Chartering Services). Below is a segmental breakdown of Wilmar’s 2018 revenue:

Weighted average age of oil palm plantations is 11 years. And in case you’re wondering (due to the recent haze in the region), Wilmar has a strict no-burning policy and is one of seven found members of the Fire Free Alliance — a multi-stakeholder group for the management of haze and fire problems in Indonesia.

This segment has reported back-to-back declines in revenue, from US$5.9 billion in 2016 to US$4.0 billion in 2018. This is due to a drop in sales volume and sugar prices.

6. Wilmar’s other businesses include its fertiliser operations in Indonesia, and the ownership and management of 65 tankers/dry bulk vessels with a total tonnage of 2.3 million MT. Revenues for this segment have declined since it hit a peak of US$1.6 billion in 2011.

7. Wilmar has maintained its group revenues at US$40-45 billion annually since 2011. Growth from its oilseeds and grains segment was offset by weaker sales from other segments.

Shareholders’ earnings have slowly declined from US$1.9 billion in 2009 to US$1.1 billion in 2018. This is mainly due to a fall in profits from the tropical oil and sugar segments during the period.

Likewise, Wilmar’s return on average equity has fallen gradually from 18.3% in 2009 to 7.0% in 2018.

The Fifth Perspective
While Wilmar has a strong downstream business and group profits have stabilised in the last few years, Wilmar’s profitability is still subject to movements in commodity prices.
Therefore, an investor in Wilmar has to be aware of the cyclical nature of the business and whether they are comfortable with its inherent volatility.
