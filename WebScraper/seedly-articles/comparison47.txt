4 min readIn 3 days, the National Steps Challenge would be back with Season 4 till 30 April 2019.
I have always wanted to join the National Steps Challenge because I have been clocking 10,000 steps almost every day with my AIA Vitality for more than a year ANYWAY.

So why not kill two birds with one stone by achieving both goals and receive spending vouchers from both sides, am I right?
If you would like to be rewarded by just walking around or keeping fit, THIS ONE’S FOR YOU!
Where else can you be rewarded by moving around / clocking steps?

Top 3 choices I will redeem my Healthpoints with, and Why?
Before you commit to clocking your steps, you definitely would like to see if the rewards are worth your time. They have a variety of vouchers from lifestyle retailers, F&B outlets and even supermarkets.
1. Health Promotion Board (HPB) Printed Voucher
There is a long list of merchants that accept the HPB Voucher, pretty much every merchant possible! You can use the HPB Printed Voucher at:

Supermarkets: Cold Storage, FairPrice, Giant, Jasons, Marketplace, Sheng Siong
My favourite bubble tea stores: Koi, LiHo
Watsons and Guardian
Shopping mall vouchers

The list is really extensive, pretty impressive. Just by looking at this, I AM SOLD, I will register to participate in NSC already.
