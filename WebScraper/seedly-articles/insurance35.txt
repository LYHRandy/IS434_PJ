According to the Department of Statistics Singapore, females tend to outlive their male counterparts by at least 4 years.
With that, the payout for male insurance happen much earlier than female so insurance for males tend to be more expensive.

Don’t Be Fooled by CHEAP Premiums!
Ultimately, you get what you paid for. You don’t go paying $300 for a flight expecting first class services and amenities.
Food for Thought
With that said, I shall leave you with a food for thought. Personally, I would consider the credit rating of the insurance company before purchasing from them. I would definitely need to be confident that they will be able to pay out in any case of anything, right? What do you think?
