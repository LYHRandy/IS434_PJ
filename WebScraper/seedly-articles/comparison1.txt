2 min readHave you been losing patience with the Singapore Savings Bond (SSB) lately since the interest rates haven’t been the most attractive?
Well, if you haven’t seen it yet, the latest issue for Singapore Savings Bond (SSB) just doesn’t cut it for a lot of us.

While it’s one of the safest investments you can make, it doesn’t even beat the average inflation rate.
As you’ve seen, the highest rate that you’ll get is 1.74% per annum, and that’s only after you’ve kept your money inside for 10 years!
Yea, I know, it’s better than putting it in a regular savings account with interest of 0.05%, but c’mon, you can do better than that…
So, where else can you grow your money with low risk?
Yea, you thought right! You can consider putting your money into a fixed deposit account as an alternative to SSB!
In fact, with the promotional rates that the banks are offering right now, it’s really a pretty good deal!

TL;DR – Best Fixed Deposit Promotion Based On Placement Amount

Yea, you’re right, why keep your money with SSB for 10 long years, when you can get higher interest rates in a year or less?
Maybe you just have to be a bit more hardworking, and look out for more promotions when your tenor is up.
But hey, it’s your money, I’m sure you want the best investments for yourself.
Of course, you’re not just restricted to CIMB or Maybank, there are other banks offering attractive promotional rates for their fixed deposit accounts that are better than the current SSB.
