A stint in Bloomberg gifted me with a beer belly, which only grew larger when I moved on to become a Professional Trader. Now I turn caffeine into digestible finance-related content. You can contribute your thoughts like Ming Feng here.

If the first thing you think about is the metal rice bowls you see in Korean restaurants, you are thinking of food way too much!
An iron rice bowl is a term we often use to refer to occupation with guaranteed job security that promises stable income, benefits and a certain level of progression.
In Singapore, civil servants working for the government may have earned the prestige of “iron rice-bowl” career. But like how most good things come to an end, we are at a time where the usually perceived stable career routes are falling through the cracks of our ever-changing economy.

Singapore To Have 7,000 Fewer Teachers By End 2019


A Decrease In Permanent Staff In The Education Sector
We chanced upon the Ministry of Education Budget 2019 report and one particular set of number stood out from the rest.
The number of permanent staff in the education sector will be reduced to 40,184 from 47,836, a sharp decline of 7,652 employees. This cut in manpower comes mainly from Education Service. It is estimated that the number of permanent staff in the education service sector will be reduced to 32,567.
We are looking at a decrease of 7,220 staff when compared to 39,787 education service staff in the year 2018.
Are our teachers in trouble?

What Could Be The Reason Of The Cut In Manpower?
While trying to find the reason accounting for this manpower cut in the number of teachers, we realised that the recruitment numbers decreased from the year 2009 to the year 2015.

We chanced upon an article that indicates that the reduction in the hiring of teachers before the year 2015. Then, the focus of recruitment was mainly to replace teachers who left the teaching force.
While we do not have all the answers to the lesser number of teachers required, here are some of the possible explanations for this reduction in manpower.
Low Birth Rate
The effect of low birth rate might be kicking in with less demand for education due to the shrinking population. With fewer children to educate as time goes by, the need for teachers reduces too. Unless we can find a way to increase the birth rate or attract more students, this will be a constant worry.
Less Labour required Due To Technology
Another possible reason might be due to the advancement in technology that allows educators to teach a larger group of students, reducing the amount of labour required.

Abolishing Of The “Iron Rice Bowl”
The abolishing of “iron rice bowl” is not something that is uncommon.
Certain careers that are essential in the past have the possibility of making way for new skill sets required for the changing economy and needs of the nation.
To give a better idea, here are some of the jobs that did not exist ten years ago:

SEO Specialist
Social Media Manager
Grab Driver
App developer
Social Media Influencer
Cloud computing specialist
Drone operators
AI engineer
Vlogger
Youtuber
User Experience Expert
Data Miner

With the birth of new jobs, it also means the death of some.

This is actually nothing new. In the year, China reshaped its public institutions to improve public services which affected the jobs of 30 million civil servants.

When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.
Education remains one of the expenses which parents are willing to spend on. For someone who is still passionate about educating, an alternative career providing private tuitions, and giving enrichment classes can still give the same joy.
Having a career switch is definitely doable too, as long as one is keen to learn.
