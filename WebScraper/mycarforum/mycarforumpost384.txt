Try the sugar gel types, they are usually more effective, not because they are more toxic but just a more attractive bait.

If you can't find the thing that is attracting them then try to find the trail as close to the source i.e start of ant trail as possible, and place something / bait that will attract them. Example a bowl of sweetened water. The bowl makes it easier to clear away and 'promotes' drowning of ants. 

This will cut off the trail and make them gather nearer to their source. Then when the bait is full and they are having their mass orgy, just spray insecticide. 
 

Hope this helps.

Key is to kill the queen, hence the use of bait otherwise its endless, even then when one specie is killed usually replaced by another type and colony.

i am one that bought the sugar gel type ant baits all the way from ebay america.
 

they works wonders as the ants will always be attracted to it.
 

but, it will only last a few weeks, then you will see the ants coming back, its like they spawn again.
 

i will use the gel again, and the cycle keeps repeating.
 

gave up, these ants will never disappear, like energizer, they keep spawning and spawning.

Either learn to live with them or get used to the exterminating cycle (they always come back).  
 

I have gotten used to the cycle. Sometimes your home will be ant free for up to 2 months. But at times they come back as fast as 2 days.

Don't throw away your ant poison. It works but you need to add some honey or milk to it to attract the ants. The ants will disappear in 2 days.

Try the Syngenta brand, its based on Thiamethoxame, slower acting that way its ensured to be transferred to the Queen but again you will have another specie replacing them. Usually it takes quite a few gos unless you stay next to a reserve which makes it next to impossible. Unfortunately resistance will occur and switching brands helps

worker ants are known to be workers... 

They dont eat the sugar & they will bring every single "crystal" back home let it rot before they eat the rotten stuffs... 

They like sugar because it is faster to rot rather then they have sweet tooth   .
 
 

So how do you lure them away when they bring those food back home??? 

You are just making them walk further & work harder....

Those type like Combat (plastic box with the poison) dun seem to work for me. 

I prefer those small china brand.. like $2 per yellow box from DIY shop.... where u pour out some crumbs along the trail.. ants will tapao home.
 

But it takes about 1 week to see the effect. But so far I used.. it will eventually solve the problem. Combat.. hard to entice the ants to enter the plastic box.

wow.... ants are harder to deal with than greedy mouths/stomachs     .....  can track their paths and find out where their 'kingdom' is?  at least find out the entrance and spray as much insecticide as possible?... or borrow an ant-eater from the zoo?

Most of the time, their kingdom is hard to reach.

Even so, they have more than one escape route. 

No matter how much you spray into the hole, they would just not use it until their inspector gave the go ahead. Cycle starts all over again...

Depending on what sort of ants, you need different technics.  
 

How I know? Because I hate ants! I had learnt to kill them.

Try the sugar gel types, they are usually more effective, not because they are more toxic but just a more attractive bait.



 

No use one, i asked the pest control they say is better to mix the toxic with a bit of white sugar to attract the ants, did that method and wipe up nearly 80% of all ants in my house

If a man can run as fast as an ant, he would run as fast as a racehouse. 

If a man can lift as much as ant, it would be 20 times of his/her own body weight. 
 

Small doesnt mean a thing. 

If that you remember, we all came from a full stop   .. 
 
 

I used to have ants all over the place, unable to find the nest and only their trails. 

So what I did was remove all the furniture (change new ones), clean up the whole place, pray that they dont come back & it works...

Go to any hardware shop in JB and ask for Anti Ants liquid (DO NOT TOUCH WITH YOUR FINGER, it will cause serious inflamation, after apply let it dry for 2hrs). Once reach home, apply the liquid with a paint brush on all the side of the wall in your house. The liquid will last 6 to 8 mths before next re apply. Ants and lizards will stay far away from your house. Not sure why SG dun have such liquid.

I'm using the terro pco ant bait.
 

Works like a charm! For the first 2-3 days, you will see a sudden surge in the number of ants. Don't worry about it. Within a week, the ants just disappeared. For the first time I used it, the ants were gone for around 5 months before coming back which I suspect is a new cluster. Used Terro once more and again, they went away.

Yup, they will feast on the bait for quite a while. The poison is Borax which they will bring back to their nest to feed their babies and queen etc.
 

The good thing is that Borax is relatively safer for children and those with pets as compared to other ant poison. In fact, borax are also used to get rid of fleas on dogs and cats.

but mine is totally different..
 

after the ants feast on the bait, they remain there... until they died..

while they are suppose to bring back...

which they dont...

Strange leh..... for my case, i did see a few ants "drowned" in the bait. But I do see a trail going back to their hidden nest leh. That's why the instructions on the box did mention that we should not kill the ants which are going back with the poison. Otherwise, the nest would not die. Plus borax is a slow acting poison which takes effect 24-48 hrs later. So if the ants died at the bait, it means they have been feasting there for a LONG time!!!  :D

need to revive this thread as recently my house is infested with ants, not black, not white, not fire ant, but those small ants (got some funny smell when you kill it with your finger and smell it, my family call it "papaya ants")
those ants used to confined around the kitchen cabinets area but until recently when I have completed my house reno (did'nt replace the kitchen cabinets) they starts to crawl all over the house!
 
my office cubicle used to infested with these type of ants too, overnight nesting inside my pedestal, then move into my desk phone, under my monitor stand, even inside my water filter jug! but all gone and no ants at all after company engaged pest exterminator who comes monthly to spray on the carpet.
 
I was thinking of engaging these exterminator as well if nothing helps.
 
I have tried using those peanut type ant powder but these ants doesn't attracts to it, only black ants does.

Terro ant killer.
Some NTUCs (finest and those Xtra ones) will have it.
 
It's a small bottle of liquid. about $7-8 dollars for that small bottle. Drop some of this liquid along the ant trails. They are attracted to it and they will bring it back to feed the queen. It's indigestible for them, so they will die.
 
It takes only a few days.
Best ant killer solution period.

Must find their nests.  Buy those ant bait and place it near their nests or places where you see a lot of ants. 
 
Have to change different brand over time,  They are quite smart, they recognise the smell.  
 
The ants are very irritating de, although destroy, they will come back after few months, keep all food in an air tight container so they cannot smell.
 
I once trace the ants trait and found that they actually had a nest inside the wooden knives holder in the kitchen.  No matter how clean I kept at the kitchen top I still see them.  One day, I hit the knives holder against the table and saw many ants fallen down.  I hit harder and more and more fell including the queen ants.  I put the whole holder inside a pail of water and all ants floated out and there were a total 8 queen ants!

If u see ants, observe their behaviour, it's quite easy to identify possible nesting sites for them. Very often is between the cabinets and the wall etc.
Use the terro ant killer i mentioned earlier, drop it where they congregate. If they finish it, drop a bit more. confirm within 3 days no more ants.
 
The only times it's tough is when once my wife said the ants refused the bait. But eventually some succumbed haha  
 
My wife is very particular with no ants in the house.

Sprinkle on them if there was a line for your food.
After a while, all of them will be gone.

Hard to no ants in the house de, esp if you cook. Cause the smell and the food preparation on the kitchen top might attract ants, even you thought you have clean the kitchen top and hob thoroughly. I guess my ants nest is behind my kitchen cabinets and below my kitchen top in between the crack. Cause seems like they crawl out from there, so dont know where i should place those ants bait. I scare wait i use sprinkle those powder form or liquid type ant bait on kitchen top and sink, wait it might accidentally containment the food.

For a flat, i think It's really quite easy to remove household ants since not landed or ground floor unit. As compared to cockroaches or lizards.
 
My in laws went on 1 week holiday, and my wife wiped out most of the ants in their flat.

U have to keep killing them. Every few months they will try to invade my kitchen or even troop in under my main door.
But my wife will observe them and place the bait accordingly.
 
But the bait makes it much easier. they usually just die in the nest. And since the nest is hidden, no mess to clean up haha

I just kept wondering where the ants were coming from and following the trail, I found the nest and took everything out from the cupboard and then cleaned the whole cupboard. btw, there was no food inside this cupboard.

now they keep appearing on my dining table although we don't keep food on the table. I used the lemongrass oil also no use. just can't find their nest.

Many times it is not about whether there is food or not, maybe it is the smell in that area that attract ants.

This works very well for me. Can buy from NTUC.  eliminates fast and best if no dead bodies lying around. It's almost like they just vanish.

Works the same as ant bait. All ants disappeared within a day. I have rabbits at home and would attract ants from the fresh food or veggie and some treats. Didn't expect an army of ants to grow. So this come in real handy.

Ant baits are only good to kill those already on the house. But if don't do preventive measures, they will be back in no time. 
 
I recently had an ant problem, started with trails of ants in kitchen. Everyday wipe everyday also see ants. So followed the trails end up opened an unused kitchen cupboard found one whole army inside. Freaked us out! While clearing the nest, a lot of them escaped and entered into different places. Everyday still seeing ants, ended up called pest control. They came and put bait, but more ants found after a few days. Gave up, last resort use aerosol spray. We used Bio X, it's very effective, we sprayed wherever we see ants. And we also sprayed at entry points such as windows and main door. 
 
After two weeks, ants were finally controlled. But we realised sometimes scout ants still roaming outside the windows. They are still trying to find a way in. So we religiously sprayed a perimeter every week now. Cleared, cross fingers.
 
My advice is, spray regularly at entry points such as windows and main door. Prevention is better than cure. If they cannot enter, you won't find them in your house for as long as you maintain the spraying. There's no free lunch in the world, if you don't want ants in the house, you cannot be lazy, have to make effort to spray and prevent. Just like SG defence, imagine our coastal guards just patrol only when see intruders then we are doomed. Must patrol everyday, every hour them can ensure totally defence.

If the above isn't working, call in a professional. Sometimes, you just need to bring in the pros.

If u see ants, observe their behaviour, it's quite easy to identify possible nesting sites for them. Very often is between the cabinets and the wall etc.
Use the terro ant killer i mentioned earlier, drop it where they congregate. If they finish it, drop a bit more. confirm within 3 days no more ants.
 
The only times it's tough is when once my wife said the ants refused the bait. But eventually some succumbed haha  
 
My wife is very particular with no ants in the house.
I bought the terro in ntuc. Last night put one drop near the hole in the wall where ants go in and out. They took it but today I still see ants walking. So i put another 2 drops, they walked past! What should I do now? Try another bait? Spray? Or just wait it out?

The terro, when they are interested in teh bait it works great. But sometimes they have no interest. Sometimes have to place it at different places.

I tried the golden hammer gel, also no use now. They avoid. Looks like my last resort is spray.

Old school way is put pandan leaves, especially surrounding the places you store your food at.
 
Works for mine so far.

Someone say ants don't like talc powder. You may try putting them at entry points to your house.
The better powder I have added poison (borax) - terro ant powder
http://www.terro.com/terro-ant-dust
I throw them in ant's path. Then they disappear. But for a while, they come back somewhere else.
 
You might try to find some kind of ant powder at aliexpress.

That's the problem, they always come back. how I wish can find a way they never back. Currently spraying weekly with Bio X works for me.

I have no luck with baits. They don't take, I have tried granular and liquid baits all fail.

Bought this, bcuz I want to use it as a powder spray for termites inside wood.
Got some sweet stain left on the ground and the ants came.
I tried this spray powder on them and yeap they died.
 
The thing about powder is that you can leave it there and the ants on contact will die.
 
But you have to keep it away from small children and probably pets as well.

Just make sure frequent cleaning on the areas that the ants frequent visits. After a while, the area will be too clean for the ants to find anything there and will move.

Yes, cleaning frequently is important. Ants like to nest in areas that has minimized human activity, such as cupboards which are seldom used. But sometimes, ants just want to come in even though not due to food. They need to nest so that their clan is safe while foraging for food.

For many months, I see ants travelling along my corridor walls every week. I need to spray at the walls and my doorstep to prevent them from entering. Written to MP no response, he thinks ants small problem. But it's town council responsibility to take care of external problems outside our units isn't it?

Leaving us to spray on our own. Now I want to check with other neighbors of different floors on how bad their ant situation is. Then create a synergy of complaints and make it me maybe via media.

There are bound to have ants everywhere at any point of our lives. I am not complaining just because of a few occasions of ant sightings. I stayed in my current place for 16 years but we were never bothered by ants, they appear only a few times a year and not in hoards. Only recently, ants invasion is on the rise and they appear everywhere and every week. This is not normal. It also coincides with the fact that we also notice a sharp decrease in cleanliness of our block. Corridors were not swept even once a week, they only wash corridor once a month and that's it. Plants downstairs were not pruned properly. Lobbies were stained and dirty. All these contributed to the rise of pests.

Then you should highlight to town council on lack of cleanliness, ask them to improve on cleaning the surrounding to prevent rise of pests and mozzies. If you tell them only ants, maybe they would not do much. Also you need to keep writing to them until they cannot tahan.

In fact, we started by talking about the cleanliness of the block first. Then complain about ants and other pests seen by other neighbors. I have sent them more than a dozen emails and even called them to come and sweep our corridor when it gets too dirty. After a few rounds of emails, they stopped replying. Then we escalate to MP, after two rounds of email he stopped replying. All they can say is, they will look into it. But nothing being done despite after a few months.

Like this also can ah? Town council stop replying to your dozen of email? And even MP also stopped following up? Then what is the use of having all these people?

Then what is the use of having all these people?That's why next step is to get synergy from neighbors. I am sure many people staying in our block felt the cleanliness has been compromised. I already had three neighbors complaining about more ants and cockroaches. Now we just have to get more neighbors to speak up then can take other actions.

Maybe ants and cockroaches to them is not important to take action. If you complain there are more mozzies, maybe they would scare. Cause mozzie problem can become dengue problem if they have no sense of urgency in taking action. Dengue can die people, but ants and cockroaches problem would not die people.

Become NEA send people to spray drains only. But it doesn't solve the cleanliness issue.
