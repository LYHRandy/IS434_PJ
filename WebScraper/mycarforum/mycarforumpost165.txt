Between the dichotomous desires of asset appreciation for existing homeowners and affordable housing for first-timers, the choice, announced at the National Day Rally, is to slice this Gordian knot by promising price stability for Build-To-Order flats via more subsidies.
 

The belief in home ownership as a fundamental principle for Singapore has remained unchanged. 
 

Singapore, however, has changed much since the 1960s. 
 

Citizens no longer live in slums and squatter settlements; home ownership rates now stand at 90 per cent instead of 9 per cent.
 

Nearly every family here now has a home. But with geographical limits on the numbers of new flats that can be built, and the budgetary constraints to the amount of subsidies that can be given, is it then realistic for every new nuclear family to expect a new flat?
 

This may encourage overconsumption of valuable resources and create a potential fiscal liability for future generations. Already, the Prime Minister hinted at a future tax hike in an increasingly tax competitive world.
 

In the book, Fault Lines: How Hidden Fractures Still Threaten The World Economy, Professor Raghuram Rajan argues that promoting home ownership among those who could not afford it led to systemic imbalances, a possible cause of the 2008 financial crisis. There may be lessons here.

technically its not wrong 
 

why do we have this home ownership mentality? Is it important to "own" your home? 
 

I would be happy to rent a GCB for 2$ a day, for the rest of my life. 
 

But the broader issue here is, in the face of runaway prices, people have nowhere to stay. So, we do what we can to help our lower income brethrens. Its welfare, singapore-style. IMO, The lower income dont really care about owning a home, they need a place to stay, at a price they can afford. And if it comes in the form of ownership of a 2rm 99 year LH, so be it. Lets face it, can you pay rent using your CPF? 
 

Tan Si An feels that we shouldnt help the lower income find a place to stay, and thats what irks me.

I don't mind renting if rental rates are reasonable and 20% of my monthly salary isn't channelled to CPF.
 

Unfortunately neither of the above are applicable.

House not= home. Just saying
 

Home can be apartment, semi detach house, detach house, carvan, or even a cave etc. 
 

Most people in Singapore do not live in a house.  
 

Anyway, back to topic, home ownership is one of the good thing about Singapore, price, not so much. The major things that need to change is make it more affordable for the mass.

Singapore, however, has changed much since the 1960s. 
 

Whereas home ownership initially provided financial security and a sense of belonging, heavily subsidised flats now provide the means to property speculation after the minimum occupation period.
 

Unlike spending in healthcare, where patients might die, home ownership is not a necessity but a lifestyle choice. One could live with one

already made it affordable liao

but the "unspoken" thing is ... buy at age 30 and service loan until 55/60 with almost "nothing" in your cpf
 

unless the affordability barometer also use TDSR like can only use 60%-80% of OA contribution to service home loan ... see how many can afford today pricing

bro,
 

the words "living beyond our means" have different interpretations,
 

1) if our prices are low, and we enjoy the high life, then yes = living beyond our means
 

2) if prices are skyrocketing, and we are struggling to even maintain our current lifestyle, and in the process used up all of our means = Not living beyond our means, but living in a cost nightmare...

A lot of Singaporeans live beyond their means these days, but not unlike many in other nations to be fair, maybe more so than many but thats anotehr topic.
 

The rediculous amount of money for instance that Singaporeans pay for renovation, often genetic and suspicous workmanship & materials used (if you are unlucky), are excessive for many people (if you are rich, then by all means) in my view.
 

There are a lot of things that I think in general, people spend too much money on, but housing, however is not living beyond means, but out of no choice due to excessive housing price.
 

If you are lucky to be born & buy home earlier, in 90s or before, then you will not sweat much, like my parents did, on humble paychecks. Could have & should have bought 2 HDB then (one beside for my grandparents, but for some reasons,  did not happen), without sweating much also. 
 

But its massively different these days. The same type of jobs, you have to work far longer to afford similar living space. Its not completely fair comparison in my view. fact is, price of housing have rise far beyond the average pay compare to many years ago.

Yes price has risen.
 

but i tell you what has risen more and faster.

People's expectations.
 

Therefore, yes house ownership is a lifestyle choice. (you said it, ridiculous amount of money paid to renovate)
 

Using me as an example, if I sell my property today and downgrade to a 5 room flat, get two Japanese cars, I could retire and still live quite luxuriously by most standards.
 

but will I? No, still slog and slog, trying to get more expecting more.  thats our nature.  But then i dont expect someone to pay my bills.  Its my lifestyle choice.
 

Maybe I should then say that I got NO choice, due to work and other commitments and face factor and relatives and friend expectations, I NEED a 6,000sft detached, 3 premium continentals and to dine in minimum 5 star restaurants 5 times a week?   
 

muayhahahahahaahaha
