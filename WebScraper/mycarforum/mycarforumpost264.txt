Haven't married thinking of how many rooms he need to start a family.

He shud have blamed his parents for having too many kids though.

Since he still single, he needs privacy to view porn on his PC? No enuff privacy to PCC I guess.
 
 

Feb 25, 2011 

Add more bedrooms to HDB flats for more privacy 
 

AS THE Government thinks of schemes and bonuses to help boost Singapore's low birth rate, it should address a pressing need for individual privacy and update the design of Housing Board flats.
 

I live in a unit with three bedrooms. My sister has her own room and I share one room with my brother, while my parents have their own bedroom. 
 

This was never a problem when we were young, but once we reached our teens, our home became more cramped, especially with our need for more privacy. 
 

Most HDB flats - even five-room and executive - have only three bedrooms - one for the parents, and two for the children.
 

If a family unit comprises grandparents as well, then that leaves only one room for the children.
 

With such limited rooms, why would a family want to have more children only to squeeze them all into one room? 
 

Future HDB flats should provide more but slightly smaller rooms for children - for example, four bedrooms instead of the standard three. This would offer more space and privacy for each child to grow up and eliminate some of the worry of couples planning to have children.

I guess new generation wants everything to be served on a platter to them, not willing to rough it or live according to their circumstances.

During our grandparents time, family units were between 5 to 10 in size, but can live together in a 3 room flat. They just lived with it.

If u compare the size of new flats to old ones...the size is getting smaller but price...getting "bigger"...is it a hint from the gahmen not to have too big a family or dun stay with your parents or just want to cut cost and earn more...
 

about 20yrs ago a 5-room is about 120-140 sq..now about 110...if u want bigger go for executive flat which of coz cost more...
 

Adding rooms on your own...save the trouble...extra cost, reduce space and the house even more cramp...
 

That fark too good life...share room with 1 brother still KPKB...ok mah...need to PCC after watching porn?

I stay in a 5rm flat (not executive not maisonette) with 4 bedrooms, but many people I know knock away one of the bedroom to make bigger living room.
 

So for those who wants 4 bedrooms, just buy resale, have many of these in many areas, Woodlands, Choa Chu Kang, Hougang, etc all have.

bro, it a valid complain. i am marriage with 2 children. however, i will also like to take care of my aged parents and also give birth to one or 2 more.
 

but current HDB BTO no longer build Executive condo and frankly speaking, their new design of 5 room cannot really allow you to build one more room into the living room without making the living room with no windows. (no windows mean house is going to be very suffocating.  everything is fine if my 3rd child gender is the same as my first 2 child. but what if its a different gender?? my parents arent exactly that old. before they hit 80s. they will likely see my children graduate or even get marriaged. but between now till then. what are we going to do?? squeeze all children into one room through their teens and adulthood? no problem if its same gender. but what if they are of different gender??

Bro...my view on this....
 

There is a correlation between education level and income level...and correlation between income level and size of property (no. of rooms)...but a somewhat weak correlation coefficient between size of property and number of children in the household.
 

And parents with degrees or post grad degrees are encouraged to have more children....
 

Make your own conclusion.

Rubbish, my uncle who are not educated have given birth to lots of schoolar children. what nosense are you talking about?
 

BTW, i have the capability to buy a bigger house. So?? is there a bigger HDB around?? no. you know what is the issue or not??? HDB did not build enough big size house. so what if i have the income to buy, i cannot buy because there is non available.
 

as for Private, i dont like the fact that i have to go through a farking gate to go into my house and landed??? dont like the fact that i dont get to know my neighbour better.

Anyway, most condo at most only have 3 to 4 rooms. still not enough.
 

sometime you should use your brain a bit before shooting off.

of couse that is what i am driving at, however. there will come a day where there is no more old 5room available in singapore. do we complain only during that time??
 

no, we should state the problem now. you know what is the problem?? we have too many ppl like Thargo, only go with the flow of the gahmen policy and dont voice out. hence our house is getting smaller and smaller and the price is getting higher and higher.

yes you would like to take care of you aged parents and have a few more children.. thats good... therefore since you already have this plan... you should start house hunting now.... there are still resale flats with 4 bedrooms....
 

seriously... if you intend to have 6 kids... how many rooms you need...to be fair... how many people have 4 kids and wish to take care of aged parents under 1 roof? even if there are flats with 5 bedrooms available... can we ensure it be sold to those who need the 5 bedrooms?

you are talking about executive condo?? those are around the size of a 5 room lor. check liao. i am talking about excutive apartment with real 4 bed room.
 

even DBSS room design cannot make it. they should just forgo DBSS and build executive apartment. but gahmen want to earn money. hence they insert a DBSS to push up Condo price.
 

anyway, if 6 children is easy lah. same gender 1 room lah. basically, ideal should have 4 bedroom min for large family. 
 

1 room for parents, 1 room for couple, 1 room for male children 1 room for female children.

If different gender, then you get that case that was reported in TNP a while back - brother watch porn then instead of "talking" to Mrs. Palmer talked to his little sister.  :angry: 
 

There are a limited number of jumber flats in the north - but I don't want to think about the cost. 
 

I have brought the issue up to local MP, and my thoughts are that HDB should more closely correlate their pricing to family income level. 
 

To get a house big enough for four bedrooms I would had to think about the cost.  I know that when got our place in 2005 the pricing went like this

90 SQM 4 room = $150k

110 SQM 5 room = $210k 

130 SQM Exec = $330K  
 

You do the math, between 4 and 5 room, extra 20 sqm is $60k. 

Between 5 room and exec the same extra 20 sqm is $120k 
 

So in today's market, if I wanted to have 2 girls, a boy and grandma plus my wife and I in a 130 -140 sqm (which is actually small for this size family) how much am I going to be paying? 
 

Currently have two kids, I am happy with two and will be stopping here.  A third has crossed our thoughts, but one of the big mitigating factors is: where would we put it?  Grandma is now 65 - so she will probably still be around at least until the kids are teens - three kids in one HDB size bedroom, not very realistic right?  (two can manage ok if same sex) and this is putting aside the thought of having mixed sexes. 
 

Would I be able to afford a house big enough to fit the whole family if I had a third?  Really dunno, and dunno if I would WANT to - guessing that to do so I would be paying somewhere in the $600-700k range (IF I was lucky enough to get from HDB, if private, it's going to be over a million I would think).  Do I want to go from a $800 per month mortgage to a $2k mortgage?  I don't think so.

This depends on what you think SHOULD be the role of HDB. 
 

Currently they take a very hands off approach to family make-up of who gets what flats. So long as you meet the marriage and citizenship requirements can buy what you like - so you can end up with DINKs in Executive and a three generation / 3 kid family in a four room.   If you view of "public housing" a little more socialistically, and HDB were to step up and manage the whole process a lot more then you could, for example, implement a rule whereby to qualify for a five room MUST be at least four people living there, or that genuine four bedroom flats are offered, but are reserved for families with three children.
 

Would it be restrictive?  ABSOLUTELY. 
 

But it is public housing.  That is the whole point - as a society we provide the housing targeted to those that most NEED it (as opposed to want it). 
 

If you are a couple that doesn't want kids, but does want a "big space" then you are quite free to buy condo at the end of the day.

I have a hazy recollection (and never read the actual law, so it may be urban legend), but I THINK that BY LAW brother and sister, over the age of 10 or so CANNOT share bedroom.  As in if got one boy, one girl, both in teens, each must have own bedroom. 
 

Naturally, the enforcement is going to be tough (if in fact it's a law at all), but just as an example.

they still control 1 and 2 rooms flats..
 

so in terms of number of bedrooms
 

1 room - low income

2 room - couple with no kids

3 room - couple with 1 kid

4 room - couple with 2 kids

5 room - couple with 2 kids and aged parents or 3 kids
 

private property - free for all
 

so we should be controlled like this.... it would be better?
 

or 
 

1 room - low income

2 room - low income

3 room - free for all

4 room - free for all

5 room - couple with 2 kids and aged parents or 3 kids

Not SG law...my hometown law.  This is why my bedroom was a caravan when I was a teenager.  Mummy&Daddy house only have two bedroom when I a teenager.  There was a sunroom, but no opening windows, so not suitable for a bedroom.

BY LAW but if they don't, govt arrange free lodging?



 

Hmmm....this is why...at the time I was like 14, and I never care enough to go look up the actual rule, the penalties and the remedies.  Would imagine that it would be some form of "daily fine" for each day it goes on.  Parents would be expected to expand house or move.  If cannot afford, then can apply for "public" housing.

Haven't married thinking of how many rooms he need to start a family.

He shud have blamed his parents for having too many kids though.

Since he still single, he needs privacy to view porn on his PC? No enuff privacy to PCC I guess.
 
 

Feb 25, 2011 

Add more bedrooms to HDB flats for more privacy 
 

AS THE Government thinks of schemes and bonuses to help boost Singapore's low birth rate, it should address a pressing need for individual privacy and update the design of Housing Board flats.
 

I live in a unit with three bedrooms. My sister has her own room and I share one room with my brother, while my parents have their own bedroom. 
 

This was never a problem when we were young, but once we reached our teens, our home became more cramped, especially with our need for more privacy. 
 

Most HDB flats - even five-room and executive - have only three bedrooms - one for the parents, and two for the children.
 

If a family unit comprises grandparents as well, then that leaves only one room for the children.
 

With such limited rooms, why would a family want to have more children only to squeeze them all into one room? 
 

Future HDB flats should provide more but slightly smaller rooms for children - for example, four bedrooms instead of the standard three. This would offer more space and privacy for each child to grow up and eliminate some of the worry of couples planning to have children.
 

Mark Woon



 

All I gotta say is...
 

Dear Mark, please call HDB or speak to a knowledgeable real estate agent. There are quite a few HDB units with more than 3 bedrooms. In fact if you buy a 3 room flat, you can even buy a neigbouring 3 room unit and turn them in a single multi-generation (a.k.a. jumbo) unit.

Just a quick thought for you all...
 

I have a hazy recollection (and never read the actual law, so it may be urban legend), but I THINK that BY LAW brother and sister, over the age of 10 or so CANNOT share bedroom.  As in if got one boy, one girl, both in teens, each must have own bedroom. 
 

Naturally, the enforcement is going to be tough (if in fact it's a law at all), but just as an example.



 

Nope never heard of it, and I've read the penal code

OK...I am working now, so no time for full and detailed research, but here is one quick cite...
 

"The Canadian Crowding Index holds that a house is overcrowded if it has insufficient bedrooms according the Canadian National Occupancy Standard. The Standard states that no more than two people should share a room. Those who may share a room are couples, children under the age of 18 of the same gender, and children under the age of 5. A child aged between 6 and 17 should not share with a child under the age of 5."

If u compare the size of new flats to old ones...the size is getting smaller but price...getting "bigger"...is it a hint from the gahmen not to have too big a family or dun stay with your parents or just want to cut cost and earn more...
 

about 20yrs ago a 5-room is about 120-140 sq..now about 110...if u want bigger go for executive flat which of coz cost more...
 

Adding rooms on your own...save the trouble...extra cost, reduce space and the house even more cramp...
 

That fark too good life...share room with 1 brother still KPKB...ok mah...need to PCC after watching porn?



 

Wrong! Need to PCC while watching porn.

Ah finally, someone know what i am talking abourt 
 




If different gender, then you get that case that was reported in TNP a while back - brother watch porn then instead of "talking" to Mrs. Palmer talked to his little sister.  :angry: 
 

There are a limited number of jumber flats in the north - but I don't want to think about the cost. 
 

I have brought the issue up to local MP, and my thoughts are that HDB should more closely correlate their pricing to family income level. 
 

To get a house big enough for four bedrooms I would had to think about the cost.  I know that when got our place in 2005 the pricing went like this

90 SQM 4 room = $150k

110 SQM 5 room = $210k 

130 SQM Exec = $330K  
 

You do the math, between 4 and 5 room, extra 20 sqm is $60k. 

Between 5 room and exec the same extra 20 sqm is $120k 
 

So in today's market, if I wanted to have 2 girls, a boy and grandma plus my wife and I in a 130 -140 sqm (which is actually small for this size family) how much am I going to be paying? 
 

Currently have two kids, I am happy with two and will be stopping here.  A third has crossed our thoughts, but one of the big mitigating factors is: where would we put it?  Grandma is now 65 - so she will probably still be around at least until the kids are teens - three kids in one HDB size bedroom, not very realistic right?  (two can manage ok if same sex) and this is putting aside the thought of having mixed sexes. 
 

Would I be able to afford a house big enough to fit the whole family if I had a third?  Really dunno, and dunno if I would WANT to - guessing that to do so I would be paying somewhere in the $600-700k range (IF I was lucky enough to get from HDB, if private, it's going to be over a million I would think).  Do I want to go from a $800 per month mortgage to a $2k mortgage?  I don't think so.

IMO, new hdb flats are suitable for the younger generations...
 

I have friends whom got married, have two kids, happily ever after...
 

While the older generations (like my family) tend to be quite cramped
 

Currently, i'm living wif my parents, and my 3other siblings (total :6)@ Executive apartment
 

While my uncle, my cousin's family staying (total: 5 adults, 2 young kids) @ 4-rm flat

yeah. if the option is available of couse good. but will likely be rejected by town council when you submit the floor plan.



 

Nope you can get two 3 rooms (max unit size- as long as the combos involve 1, 2, and 3 room flats) that are next to each other under the conversion scheme. A passage between both units must be had, and it will be considered to be one unit.
 

The catch is that they cannot be sold separately again, and it will be called a multi-generation flat (aka jumbo flat).
 

MOP will be tied to the 2nd unit. Also you can buy under this scheme for BTO flats too!

Most likely is allowed, but must reinstate at own cost before either unit can be sold.



 

Unless done illegally (i.e. two different owners), then you are right. Otherwise they cannot be separated once converted to a multi-generation flat.

Long long time ago, the govt asked the people to stop at 1. Ok 2 at max.

So the HDB is perfectly positioned for family with father, mother, brother and sister.

Then not too long ago, the govt started to ask people to have 3rd or even 4th child.

But..but... HDB bo cho kang. Forgot to review the new need. Still continue to build HDB with 3 bedroom....

IMHO the govt is stuck. If they reduce prices of direct flats, then the HDB resale market will be affected by a drop in price, which inadvertently will cause a drop in price for the rest of the property market (maybe even cause a crash), or if it doesnt affect the HDB resale market, the people who paid more will cry foul.

To change the way that flats are priced and allocated now would be a major shift in govt philosophy - its not only about people "crying foul", but goes to the very heart of what the "Singapore Govt" (acrtually PAP) believes. 
 

Allocating based on "need" rather than "affordability / price" means a distinct shift towards "the left" instead of "you must work and earn what you get" 
 

Not to say one is right and the other wrong - but you can see from the Canadian example I cited that it is a very socialist ideal (too much so IMHO), whereas the SG policy is very right wing (too much so IMHO)

Then definately cannot. Ask them to rent the common area together lah. Can put a gate for ah longs to chain and lock occupants of both units out at the same time  
 

Btw door sized hole in between the two units can liao, dont need to tear down the wall.

I stay in a 5rm flat (not executive not maisonette) with 4 bedrooms, but many people I know knock away one of the bedroom to make bigger living room.
 

So for those who wants 4 bedrooms, just buy resale, have many of these in many areas, Woodlands, Choa Chu Kang, Hougang, etc all have.



 

Doesn't know 5 room flat come with 4 bedroom. Usually, 5 room flats comes up with 3 bedrooms and pretty decent spacious living room. So, you have to make a partition in the living room to make the 4th bedroom, at least, that was i thought. Are you sure, HDB 5 room new flats comes with 4 bedroom?

yeah lor. actually, i was wondering, if we rent the corridor, can we make wall at and gates?? if can, then good ideal liao. if not, then limited.

Doesn't know 5 room flat come with 4 bedroom. Usually, 5 room flats comes up with 3 bedrooms and pretty decent spacious living room. So, you have to make a partition in the living room to make the 4th bedroom, at least, that was i thought. Are you sure, HDB 5 room new flats comes with 4 bedroom?



 

it used to come with the 4th room. pretty decent size too, you might be too young to know about it,
 

5 room used to have 122sqm to 130 sqm.

Rubbish, my uncle who are not educated have given birth to lots of schoolar children. what nosense are you talking about?
 

BTW, i have the capability to buy a bigger house. So?? is there a bigger HDB around?? no. you know what is the issue or not??? HDB did not build enough big size house. so what if i have the income to buy, i cannot buy because there is non available.
 

as for Private, i dont like the fact that i have to go through a farking gate to go into my house and landed??? dont like the fact that i dont get to know my neighbour better.

Anyway, most condo at most only have 3 to 4 rooms. still not enough.
 

sometime you should use your brain a bit before shooting off.




Bro...relax and read in-between my lines first lah.  I have a IQ of 149 and so I do use my brain (I know I have low EQ though).
 

1. Private housing can have as many rooms as you can afford.  You want more kids and a room for each kid, your wallet is the limit.
 

2. Public housing can only have that many rooms.  If you want a room for each kid, there are only so few kids you can have.
 

3. People who are more educated generally have higher incomes and are more likely to afford private housing. 
 

4. There are some school of thoughts flying around that the better educated and richer person raise more successful kids.  So they should have more kids.
 

5. There are some school of thoughts flying around that the lesser educated person generally have less successful offsprings than educated person.  
 

6.  The % of degree and post grad population is higher in private housing than public housing.
 

So you say there should be more rooms in HDB so that the occupants can have more kids (3 and more...).
 

I am very sure that will not happen in our time.  HDB only make sure each family in Singapore has a roof over their head at affordable prices.  But I dont recalled building flats with lots of rooms (4 bedrooms and above) so that families can have 3 or more kids is part of their agenda.

I think HDB should just build flats with no rooms. Then buyers can simply partition to their own liking and needs. Just like office buildings, the interior is just one big empty space. You want manager's office? Put up floor-to-ceiling partition. Want storeroom? Partition. Pantry? Partition. Problem solved.

Like dat can you imagine how much COV would be? 
 

I remember way back when, back home, one lady own a house next to a mall - they wanted to acquire her property to expand (was the last one left)...they offer her more than 4X value, but she still refuse to sell. 
 

If my neighbour come n ask my to buy my flat, I chop carrot head like Bugs Bunny - would ask for additional suitcase of money over and above what I could get on open market.  (totally wearing my Monopoly hat)

Yes you can jointly RENT common areas. Weren't you reading in the Ah Long thread  




You sure?

My flat is undergoing lift upgrading. When done, my neighbor will not need to use the common corridor.

I can buy/rent the corridor?

Dont worry, i know you are like that. but i must react a bit more furious mah. cause in my experience with you, like that you will post with a more softer posting 
 

1) Not true lah, unless landed, but those type with enough room one cost a bomb.
 

2) not 1 for each kid, more like 1 room for each genders lah
 

3) yes i agree. but doesnt equal to giving birth to clever children
 

4) this is on the whole true, because they allow them more opportunity mah. but hor, i seen rich familys with useless child too 
 

5)  cause no money for better opportunity
 

6) not because more stupid but rather no money to send them to further study. 
 

dont need a lot of room, just bring back house with 4 bedroom that can stay ppl one can liao 

4 bedroom just nice.

Your point three is one of the issues. 
 

Those with a higher income tend to have smaller families, but still squeeze the lower income, bigger family out of the larger HDB. 
 

It would be very interesting to see a correlation done between

1. Income

2. Family size

3. Flat size. 
 

What I would hypothesise is that higher income / smaller family group is over-represented in the 5 room / executive flat class. 
 

Why? Because they can afford to pay more, and they are willing to pay more to upgrade from a four room to an exec - this willingness to "pay more COV" squeezes the less affluent players out. 
 

Naturally, you will still have some in this "more wealthy" category for for private - so some will be leaving the market entirely.

It would be something to very seriously look at though. 
 

What I would love to see would be something like the re-introduction of HUDC.  
 

HDB flats VERY tightly controlled - how much buy for, how much you can sell for, can only buy 5 room if more than 5 pax live there etc etc - so is really "public" housing
 

HUDC operates more on the current principle of HDB - still controls in place for income, citizenship etc but operates on open market principles. 
 

Then you have the fully private which would be open slather - anything also can do.

Agree with you totally on your pointers.
 

Regarding the correlation....I think in Sg its more....

1.  Negative significant correlation coefficient between income and family size

2.  Positive significant correlation coefficient between income size and flat size

3.  Resulting in negative significant correlation coefficient between family size and flat size.
 

So what you get is less well off families with more family members staying in smaller housing (with lesser rooms).
 

Personally I feel that bigger families (3 kids and above) and above should be given priorities in the HDB queue for bigger flats and with more grants.  But i doubt thats going to happen anytime in the near future.

Then will have to take lift down to ground floor. But it is a short flat with only 6 units per floor.

Maybe they will reject based on this reason.

So what you get is less well off families with more family members staying in smaller housing (with lesser rooms).
 

Personally I feel that bigger families (3 kids and above) and above should be given priorities in the HDB queue for bigger flats and with more grants.  But i doubt thats going to happen anytime in the near future.



 

If enough of us petition the govt / our MPs for this, then perhaps it might?  Especially if its people like you that are speaking more from a "social justice" point of view than a "self interest" point of view? 
 

Now would be a great time to bring it up with erections just round the corner. 
 

MPs are supposed to relfect the interests and beliefs of the populace right?  
 

But should only bring it up if you are willing to "subsidise" someone elses big family.  I know that I would be willing to support (indirectly) those that are less well off than myself, but not all think this way. 
 

Anyway - who knows, perhaps we have some "spies" reading this and it will make it back into the relevant briefing documents?

Hee  
 

It would be something to very seriously look at though. 
 

What I would love to see would be something like the re-introduction of HUDC.  
 

HDB flats VERY tightly controlled - how much buy for, how much you can sell for, can only buy 5 room if more than 5 pax live there etc etc - so is really "public" housing
 

HUDC operates more on the current principle of HDB - still controls in place for income, citizenship etc but operates on open market principles. 
 

Then you have the fully private which would be open slather - anything also can do.



 

So you want the studio units style extended  Buy at price X, selling back can only be done to HDB and then only the pro-rated sum of X is returned 
 

Thats actually a good idea, but it should be limited to the lower income group, and occupancy must be maxed out as per what I quoted from the HDB website.

Parents who want to have more kids but can't provide proper space (bedroom) for the kids to grow up - Are they irresponsible parents?
 

You know my answer and so I will not 'shoot off'.



 

How you define proper space? to you probably 1 kid - 1 room. to latka, it's 3 kids - 1 room also ok.

Aren't DBSS and EC still operated on same principle as HDB though?  What I am suggesting is an entirely new class of property. 
 

"True" public housing.  Price is strongly subsidised, but resale is tightly controlled such that it is not "yours" but rather "borrowed" from govt



 

EC is a special class. On the 11th year, it becomes private. It basically replaced HUDC.

I remember I was young once and there was a time when I wanted to change and heal the world...haha... then reality bites.
 

In practice, I think it will be a tough policy to implement.  The general middle class stratus in Singapore are not likely to have more then 2 kids in their household.  They are also the class that will most likely want to 'upgrade' to a bigger 5 rooms flat.  They also have the loudest voice in general.  Such policies will not go well with them.

I have a related questions.
 

Parents who want to have more kids but can't provide proper space (bedroom) for the kids to grow up - Are they irresponsible parents?
 

You know my answer and so I will not 'shoot off'.



 

Hmm....to have kids when you "can't provide" is always irresponsible.  You want find any dispute with me on that. 
 

But it's also a very one dimensial question, and things cannot so easily reduced to this question. 
 

I would ask back to you....(with a few assumptions in place) 

1. Assuming that 3 kids = four bedrooms needed (parents, 2 sis, 1 bro, 1 for grandparents) 

2. Four bedroom HDB = top 10% in terms of price (so must be above 75th percentile of income to afford) 

3. Big enough condo / private = above 80th income percentile to afford
 

Is it a good / "just" outcome that only those in the top 20% / 25% of incomes can have more than 2 kids?  
 

And "accidental" kids tends to be correlated with lower income / lower decision making ability. 
 

So those that have the least ability to make good and rational decisions (i.e the lower educated / less intelligent) tend to be double whacked.  
 

For me, I fully know my options to prevent more kids, and am more likely to make the "right" decision.  For somebody for whom preventing kids is more important, they are going to have less ability (knowledge) to prevent the accident.

How you define proper space? to you probably 1 kid - 1 room. to latka, it's 3 kids - 1 room also ok.



 

If you ask a primary 6 kid, do you prefer to have your own room or you do not mind sharing bedroom. What do you think their answer will be?
 

If you ask a sec 1 kid, do you prefer to have your own room or you do not mind sharing bedroom. What do you think their answer will be?
 

If you ask a sec 4 youth, do you prefer to have your own room or you do not mind sharing bedroom. What do you think their answer will be?
 

If you ask a JC or poly youth, do you prefer to have your own room or you do not mind sharing bedroom. What do you think their answer will be?
 

If you ask a undergrad, do you prefer to have your own room or you do not mind sharing bedroom. What do you think their answer will be?
 

Proper space is defined not by me non by Latka.  Gone are the era where parents' wishes and thinking is the absolute law and manifestoo.

I think there is more space in Singapore for "three room / studio" rules to be expanded to cater to lower income but larger family.  But like I have already said - this would represent a major shift in the philosophy of politics and life, something I fully recognise.

Actually there is, kind of   If you have 3 kids or more, you have extra chances during balloting if buying direct from HDB. Grants are unlikely though since they're already giving cash for the 3 kid, etc.
 

Edit: Ok just checked my notes for the exact scheme. Its called Third Child Priority. It basically sates that 100% of all applicants with a third child will be included in the first round of balloting up to a max of the 5% of units that are put aside for this scheme. If the 5% is maxed out, those not selected for the first round will definitely be included in the 2nd round of balloting.

Same here...I can't afford to have more than 2 kids.  And right now, I don't think I can afford to have a second kid yet.  So I make sure I will not  be caught in such a situation.

my friend's bro and his parents just bought their flats under this scheme.
 

The brother will be buying a four room flat

The parents will be buying a three room flat
 

The flats will be next to each other and they are linked via the living rooms. Think of it like 2 connecting hotel rooms. 
 

Note: It's not a jumbo flat. It's 2 different flats but linked via a door at their living rooms.
 

Maybe HDB can offer more flats under such schemes.

1 kid - 1 room is more common now but it's not universal. You may succumb to your daughter's wishes but in some families, parents still reign supreme.
 

Eg: I do know of a family that moved to Marine Parade 3 room HDB with 2 daughters. The parents want to get the kids to Tao Nan. They sold their 4 room HDB to increase their chances and got their kids in. 
 

So how? Irresponsible parents?

this one call multi-generation. yes the old scheme is good.
 

however, the new scheme now is, 4 or 5 room link with a 2 room/studio apartment. sound good right?? until you heard the following.
 

the 4/5room is 99 years lease, the studio attach is 30 years lease and can only sell back to gahmen under studio rules. next thing is the price. 30 year lease 180K while the 4/5 room is between 450K to 550K.
 

where is the main issue?? the studio apartment attach is only 30 years lease and can only sell back to gahmen. how to move house??

I am stressing there is a need to provide personal space for the child.  As responsible parents of THIS ERA, whether I can provide growing and personal space for my child in her growing up years will be a major consideration factor in deciding whether to have another kid.
 

Don't you consider the same?
 

Or you just decide to have another kid and when you dont have enough bedrooms because you can't afford or because you can't get pass your personal preferences or dislikes of landed...you kpkb and put the blame on HDB on not having enough bigger flats?

yeah.. that's the catch with studio.. short lease.. cos it's meant for old people anyway. But honestly, i think it's a good idea to only sell back to HDB... though it really sounds ironic given the highprice of 180k, but by restricting the sales from the open market, it can have some kind of price control. Good and bad if I may say. Afterall, a studio is meant for needy people. Now if they can tweak the price of studio to much cheaper, then i can say the studio is a good option.

As a responsible parents, i want my children to have a silbing in the future to look out for each other when we left the world and not cater to some big space but no one to turn to when they are old and in need of comfort from fellow sibling. 
 

remember, blood is thicker than water.
 

you my friend might have IQ of 149, but you need to think further than just material needs. they are important but more so is the emotional support that your child need. another play buddy, a younger one to share their woes and joy with.

No no its not. multi generation aka jumbo has one owner, and each flat cannot be bigger than a 3 room flat.. In his case I think both parties jointly got approval to join the units via a door, HOWEVER as far as HDB is concerned, they are both separate units. Studio units cannot be used in this scheme.

yes, but not when the whole studio apartment is fuse with the new 4/5 room. so when 30 years lease up. then what will the existing owner do?? they cannot buy it (at least not in the law ATM.) who is going to come out with the money to seal the door??

You old enough to fark, you are old enough to rent your own space - get out of my house. 
 

This is what I plan to tell my kids - if you wanna have farking, that is fine, I don't expect you to remain virginal - but if you are mature enough for that, then you are mature enough to be taking care of yourself, which means not doing it while you are still living under my roof.

I am sure your kids will loves you when they grow up because you prepare them for the harsh world outside.  Good for you to have kids crapped into one room, that will prepare them better later in life.  That will prepare them better when they start working.
 

Steady pom pi pi.  



 

you are missing the point 
 

what i mean is, cannot prepare everything swee swee for your children. 
 

cannot purposely move to near a good school for your children. if its convinent to live near there (maybe near to parents) of couse its a good ideal. other than that, its crap and b-------t.

yeah.. that's the catch with studio.. short lease.. cos it's meant for old people anyway. But honestly, i think it's a good idea to only sell back to HDB... though it really sounds ironic given the highprice of 180k, but by restricting the sales from the open market, it can have some kind of price control. Good and bad if I may say. Afterall, a studio is meant for needy people. Now if they can tweak the price of studio to much cheaper, then i can say the studio is a good option.



 

That we asked in class too  
 

The idea is to allow senior citizens to sell their flat and get a studio and get to use the difference in price for themselves. Nothing can be done with them except for seniors to live in.

As a responsible parents, i want my children to have a silbing in the future to look out for each other when we left the world and not cater to some big space but no one to turn to when they are old and in need of comfort from fellow sibling. 
 

remember, blood is thicker than water.
 

you my friend might have IQ of 149, but you need to think further than just material needs. they are important but more so is the emotional support that your child need. another play buddy, a younger one to share their woes and joy with.



 

Sorry my friend, life seems to show that blood seems to count for naught with many when it comes to $$$

I choose my place because its near one of the top 5 primary school in Singapore.  My place is also a 10 minutes walk to my parents' place.  My place is 20 minutes drive to town (without jam).  
 

So I may not solely based my purchase decision on the proximity to the primary school.  However, to move away to another place is another thing altogether.  Me and wifey are considering to move to a more 'upmarket' condo....but i am reluctant because i do not want to give up <0.5km from the top primary school.

Both have their own front door/gate... but is linked via a door from their living rooms. What scheme is that? My friend can't recall but it sounds like it starts with "P"-something scheme.

then its valid. you move in first base on other consideration and not solely for your child. not moving to a upmarket place for your child is also good. but i dont support moving for the child only when there is no other benefit.

Actually a further problem is that HDB are not really very forthcoming about what can, and cannot be done, what schemes there are and how a family can be helped. 
 

I remember last time trying to get our flat, we had to educate more than one HDB officer on what was allowed and what we were trying to do - it took a few visits to HDB, and much looking through their website and literature, and much pointed questioning before we could understand how to go about what needed to be done. 
 

Reason being, my wife has a half share in a private property and I am PR, so our case a little bit unique....

anyway, my main issue is not with stand alone Studio apartment. the issue is with those multigeneration where one flat is 99 years another is 30 years.  then are not side by side but up and down. 1 room from the 3/4room will be upstair beside the studio apartment.

As far as HDB is concerned there is no such thing as a jumbo flat. Just multi-generation. i.e. the flat type is multi-generation.
 

It could be built by HDB and you could buy it direct (they no longer build them though), or you could buy two units and join them under the conversion scheme. 
 

Buying a ready multi-generation flat means you are buying under Public Scheme, Fianc

Ah.. commonwealth, called Multi-generation. one is studio (not 3 room) 30 years lease. another is 4/5room 99 year lease.
 

i had interested to get that one. but after discussion with my parents, think the 30 year lease is stupid.

No scheme  HDB does allow that as long as both owners are good with it, the "hole" meets safety requirements, and that it has to be sealed up when either unit changes owner.

1) multi-generation units have to be side by side.

2) Studio apartments are not eligible to be part of this scheme (oei how many times you want me to say this  )

Its actually all there on their website. Problem is actually finding the info 
 

Well I think I will be speaking to some of the family service centers once i'm in to see if i can help some of the people from the lower income group in this respect (pro-bono of course). The schemes, grants, etc are all fairly straight-forward, but as you said, those that truly need the most help are the ones that are least likely to get it.

I'm now guessing, but is what you're asking "whats going to happen to the 30yr lease studio apartments when their lease expires when the other units have 99 yrs leases???"
 

If so, HDB is going to "refurbish" the studio units and resell them with a new 30yr lease, or they will extend it if the owners don't pass away by the end of the lease.

Doesn't know 5 room flat come with 4 bedroom. Usually, 5 room flats comes up with 3 bedrooms and pretty decent spacious living room. So, you have to make a partition in the living room to make the 4th bedroom, at least, that was i thought. Are you sure, HDB 5 room new flats comes with 4 bedroom?



 

Newer flats no. Only the old ones have.

Problem is, his reasoning a little bit immature - he complaining that two bro sharing a room is "hardship" and "lack of privacy".   
 

What does he expect in life?  that queen size bed also provided for each kid?  That every bedroom must have computer and high speed internet?  
 

if he was sharing with a teenaged sister, then can respect, complain about sharing with a sibling of same sex I got no respect for him.  If he is talking "privacy" to bring home girlfriend my response would be..
 

You old enough to fark, you are old enough to rent your own space - get out of my house. 
 

This is what I plan to tell my kids - if you wanna have farking, that is fine, I don't expect you to remain virginal - but if you are mature enough for that, then you are mature enough to be taking care of yourself, which means not doing it while you are still living under my roof.




I agree that "hardship" is not the right term. As Thargor mentioned, these days, 1 kid - 1 room and Latka was from a >1 kid/ room environment. No hard and fast rule, if family can afford, so be it. If not, it's not a deal breaker, 2 to a room same gender is ok. 
 

But with the way things are going, it's inevitable that kids will leave the nest later and later, we are going the  way of HKG and eventually Japan when property prices rise will outstrip starting salaries growth.

So u didnt see what is wrong 
 

Then nothing to say liao. Btw, to get a multi-generation flat, you need to use the multi-generatiom scheme. Multi-generation BTO require you to have two different owner. One for each flat in case u do not know. Also, as far as i had check it out with HDB ( i called them) it is not possible to convert any flat to multi-generation.

Last time they use to have 7-room HDB.. they say is for multi generation one....

oh... that time they had oversupply of HDB that no one want.. so they come with this kind of promotion... sell 2 unit as 1 unit...
 

Nowaday.. all HDB... all BTO.. so not likely to have oversupply unit... so no chance for new 7-rm HDB..
 

i know Yishun use to have... u can check them out if u interested.

When is the day that u say is coming? and how would u know wat the property situation will be like when that day comes? by then we may all be sleeping in capsules and not rooms for all you know. or singapore is 50% submerged underwater. or hdb BTO flats with 4-7 bedrooms driven by demand. why even bother to predict the future? That's like discussing who will win the premier league in 2070!!!

So u didnt see what is wrong 
 

Then nothing to say liao. Btw, to get a multi-generation flat, you need to use the multi-generatiom scheme. Multi-generation BTO require you to have two different owner. One for each flat in case u do not know. Also, as far as i had check it out with HDB ( i called them) it is not possible to convert any flat to multi-generation.



 

Ok did a search. I know what you're talking about now.
 

Multi-Generation Flat = "Jumbo" Flat or Combined flat under the existing Conversion Scheme.
 

Multi-Generation Living Scheme (MGLS) = Trial scheme at SkyTerrace@Dawson for what you said. Its was only available there, and was not and has not been available anywhere else (not even SkyVille@Dawson). In fact, there has been nothing else about it since the articles on SkyTerrace@Dawnson in 2009.

Future HDB flats should provide more but slightly smaller rooms for children - for example, four bedrooms instead of the standard three. This would offer more space and privacy for each child to grow up and eliminate some of the worry of couples planning to have children.

As long as they don't get rid of the Conversion scheme, new 6 bedroom units are still possible by joining two three room units one living/dining, 4 bedrooms, one living/dining converted to bedroom, one kitchen converted to bedroom.

I only know the new JUMBO that gahmen allows is taking two 3-bedroom flats next to each other, hack down the middle wall, and you have yourself a 140-150 sq m apartment (the size of an old Executive Apartment), under 1 owner.
 

If you go re-sale, you can get two 4-bedroom JUMBO apartment into 1. Floor area of 180sq m more like it, but the houses are like at least 20-25yrs old now?
 

And 5-room HDB, be it old or new BTO, allows for either an additional study/ bedroom (whatever you wanna call it), or a bigger living/ Dining area compared to a 4-room HDB.
 

And if I'm not wrong, Executive Apartments have a defined area for Dining. Then again, you can merge it to join the Living Room area as well. Some are 3 bedrooms, some are 3+Study. 
 

In any case, super confusing, at least for me.

No need to think so much. Here are all the flats you can buy (taken from my notes)
 
 

Flats Offered by HDB 

Studio Apartment (35-45sqm)                                                       

2 Rm Flat (1 Bed, 1 Living/Dining)                                                 

3 Rm Flat (2 Bed, 1 Living/Dining)                                                 

4 Rm Flat (3 Bed, 1 Living/Dining)                                                 

5 Rm Flat (3 Bed, 1 Living, 1 Dining or 4 Bed, 1 Living/Dining)         

Executive Flat (3 Bed, 1 Living, 1 Dining or 4 Bed, 1 Living/Dining)   

Design Build & Sell Scheme Flat                                                    

Executive Condominium                                                               
 

HDB Flats in Resale Mkt

1 Room Flat (23-33sqm)

2 Rm Flat (1 Bed, 1 Living/Dining)

3 Rm Flat (2 Bed, 1 Living/Dining)

4 Rm Flat (3 Bed, 1 Living/Dining)

5 Rm Flat (3 Bed, 1 Living, 1 Dining or 4 Bed, 1 Living/Dining)

Executive Flat (3 Bed, 1 Living, 1 Dining or 4 Bed, 1 Living/Dining)

Multi-Generation Flat (two joined 3 rm flats or smaller)

HUDC Flats (non-privatised estates)
 

Note:

-Executive Flats consists of single level Executive Apartments & double level Executive Maisonettes

-DBSS Flats on the resale market are sold as Executive Flats

-Executive Condos are like DBSS Flats in which they are built and sold by the developer (subject to HDB Rules), HOWEVER unlike DBSS which will be considered Executive Flats on the resale market, EC's are marketed as EC's and will become private property after 10 years.

-HUDC Flats in privatised estates are considered to be private property.

yup.. schemes/grants etc... then throw in CPF and it gets even nicer. Minimum sum lah... valuation limit, withdrawal limit etc.



 

You want me to do a schemes/grant table??? CPF is quite easy
 

CPF

Valuation Limit (VL): Purchase price or market value whichever is lower

Minimum Sum: Minimum sum we need to have in our CPF (OA & SA) to draw more (revised yearly)

Minimum Sum Cash Component (MSCC): 50% of minimum sum

Available Housing Withdrawal Limit (AHWL): Max amount you can use for housing from your CPF after setting aside the minimum sum cash component
 

*AHWL is per owner. So if the AHWL is $120,000, EACH owner can withdraw up to $120,000 for housing
 
 

1st property 
 

> AHWL = 120% of VL (applies to properties with at least 60 years of lease remaining)
 

>Under 55 yrs

- Pay up to VL

- Set aside MSCC

- Continue payments up to AHWL
 

>Over 55 yrs

- Set aside MSCC

- Pay up to AHWL
 

2nd property onwards (if CPF is still owed money)
 

>AHWL = 100% of VL
 

>Any Age

- Set aside MSCC

- Pay up to AHWL
 

*Repayment of CPF sum used has to include interest that would have accrued if the sum was not withdrawn

But people still willing to buy a small pigeon hole for half a million.

Yes. That fellow is voicing for better designed flats and everyone benefits from it if it comes true. People speak up, yet kana "hammer". Dunno what is wrong here or the mentality of some. Ask them to voice out they scared, people voice out they "suan" them. Like that the common people sure kana makan big time. Alamak !  
 

HDB is designing flats to be smaller as years goes by and new flat prices shooting up like nobody business and people have to accept whether we like it or not. Sad, just like prices for petrol. They force it down your throat and snatch your money from your hand just like that.

you see, to certain ppl, they think that asking for a new design is akeen to asking for gahment to help in buying a bigger house for more family. when in actual fact, it is 2 different issue. 
 

the truth is, most ppl in singapore are blinded by Condo looking design of HDB which in the first place is not good enough. but they can accept and all rush to buy, hence our condo developer just continue designing home that look a like and our HDB just adopt and do a smaller version of it. then those ppl, foolishly just think its good, my house look like condo.
 

but the true of matter is, condo is good not because of the design of their home but the amnesties within their condo. but most singapore dweller dont realise that or chose not to realise that as they dont want to burst their own bubble that they are not living in a condo.

From what i observe, you will either sell it at the price of EC or 5 room. hence dont think you will earn big big

Whoa! I can only imagine, there are a few Jumbo with 200sq m of floor space. Easily can have 4 bathrooms, 7 bedrooms (after converting the kitchen to a bedroom), and a big living + Dining area.

you must understand that jumbos were ne er meant to be jumbos. they were meantvto be 4rms and so on.
 

many of the jumbos have quite funny   layout like 2 kitchens, 2 doors, funny maze of rooms. it is quite hard to combine rooms or tear down rooms bec pillar is everywhere
 

one of the best layout i have seen are those with 166sqm. the worst are the 199sqm. you got to see it for yourself to underetand

it used to come with the 4th room. pretty decent size too, you might be too young to know about it,
 

5 room used to have 122sqm to 130 sqm.




No, i have lived in jumbo flats in bedok, which has 4 bedrooms and as big as you have mentioned. But, the design was bit weird, it is like that you have attached the two 3 room flats together, which will have two kitchen and 4 bathrooms. You have to spend lot on renovation to make it  nice. But, Even i prefer 4 bedrooms in a five room flat rather than the current 3 bedrooms.

its actually easy to tear down and rebuild lah. not as difficult as you think. the problem is its not cheap. 
 

seen a few nicely done up one. if you have the time to explore, you will be surprise. but one thing about converting kitchen to master bed room though. you have a dusbin in your room
