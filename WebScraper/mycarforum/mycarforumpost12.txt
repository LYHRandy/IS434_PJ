Was having a kopitiam discussion and someone express that a more laychay loop hole for subletting is not explore.  That is to rent the fate first n then do paperwork of adding more people into the flat via the hdb updates for people staying there. Then the main tanant move out n collect rental income for the room. Is it a must for the main tanant to still stay there if the original tanant can move out and collect more rental from subletting the rooms out?

it is not only leychey it is unethical as well.  in any case, any landlord worth his salt will have already drafted in tenancy agreement no subletting is allowed.  so adding in more tenants only means you are violating the rules of the tenancy agreement.

If you want to rent out whole unit to family. Just sign 2 room rental agreements with the same family but for 2 tenants and make sure that the total amount to the rental for the whole unit. If HDB ask, just say you are still occupier, just renting out rooms lor.

But there is no rule to say if there is 3 rooms and the main tenant rented out the whole house and the other rooms can be sublet out ?
 
Just that the main tenant just need to collect the money from the sub letted unit ?

Every decent tenancy agreement and every decent agent will include the clause of non subletting. 
Subletting, or sharing of tenancy is allowed with the permission of the landlord. Some landlords also openly allow if you can pay the rent evey month and secure the tenants, subject to HDB and private limits of numbers. Most landlords will also raise the rent if the tenant numbers go up, factoring in potential wear and tear. But any tenant need to be properly registered. Else it is illegal.

as @showster have elucidated and my earlier point as well, the main tenant would have signed a tenancy contract which in most likelihood, prohibit subletting.  if main tenant still proceed to sublet without informing landlord, he is in breach of the tenancy agreement.

Don't understand leh.
 
You meant the main tenant is trying to make $$ by subletting out the whole flat after he has rented the whole flat from landlord, but is not staying there himself thereby having more space/room to be rented out?
 
I tot all subtenants details should be provided and included in the tenancy contract between the landlord and the main tenant? And any changes (add or reduce tenants) must be agreed by the landlord?

Anything you can think of as gaps, the rules will eventually cover.
 
Even subletting of bedrooms requires application to HDB as they re-state.
 
The number of people has also dropped from 9 to 6, in line with private housing. Flat owner plus occupier plus tenant = 6 max.
 
 
From May 1, occupancy cap for 4-room and larger HDB flats will be reduced from 9 to 6 people: HDB
HDB announced the new occupancy cap in a press release on Thusday (Feb 1), adding that all flat owners must also obtain its prior approval before renting out their flats or bedrooms.
"The changes seek to minimise disamenities caused by overcrowding, and to maintain a conducive living environment in our public housing estates," HDB said.
The cap for 3-room and smaller flats remains unchanged at 6 persons and 4 persons respectively.

yup thats true.
 
Reason being is that there will be cases where the landlord or owner place it with the agent to rent out.
 
The tenancy of the new potential landlord also expired at the current / old place. 
 
So far still not a problem.
 
The problem is the new tanant manage to secure a new flat. So after reno and everything 3 months can shift out liao. BUT, being untruful for lack of a better word A$$hole, the new tenant will never volunteer this infor to the landlord or the agent as not many would rent the place out for 3 months, else the going rate would not be as cheap vs one year rental.
 
In this case pretend to be stupid and sign a one year agreement with the intend to break the lease lor.
 
So being even more greedy, start to sublet the whole unit and collect rental from newbie who needs just a room.
 
I suppose with the recent rule to curtail the number of person for 3 rooms and 4 rooms would eradicate this type of behavior.

2. Agent unknowingly, never check the true intend of the new potential tanant 
 
3. New tanant move in liao, but lease is one year. Yet already got keys to another unit that was purchase
 
4. The existing old landlord do not agree to 3 months rental so the tanant LL have to try to rent
 
5. Found out no one wants to lease for 3 months so pretend to rent for a year with the intent to break lease at 3 months
 
6. As the current job there has lots of people who also wants to rent but only a room, rent out room but tell new landlord to include the new tenant additional person in .
 
7. month 3 move out and continue to collect the rent from the 3 rooms and pay rent to existing landlord.

7. month 3 move out and continue to collect the rent from the 3 rooms and pay rent to existing landlord. LL finds out, can kick the sub-tenants out.

Sounds doable to me .................  if can solve 6 & 7
 
6. kinda uncertain. I guess adding one more is ok. Other than that, most landlords will not agree. 
 
7. If inexperienced tenants, still can smoke. Those with experienced in renting or those who are careful, will ask for proof of ownership (Landlord/Owner) 
 
Aiyah, if want to keng, still got other ideas. The idea above presents too many variables and subsequent "problems"

Actual sharing is by agent who mention something like a pyramid scheme for new PR / Citizen who gotten their flat.
 
While I was doubtful at first, the moolah seems good.
 
But with the revised rules and the risk involve, its not for the faint hearted to do "loophole" subletting.

Not worth risking for HDB. Remember who is the actual land owner for your HDB. Sublet must make sure the master landlord is fully informed. The whole flat can even be confiscated.
 
For private, maybe fine...

Just yest or the day before, one minister said AirBnB will take some time to finalise.
 
For private, people can take risks.
 
For HDB, the risks are much higher, obviously. But because there are a lot more HDB flats available for rental now c.f. 5-10 yr ago, the landlords/owners are not having it easy renting out their units, at least not as easy as in the past when there were more foreigners and fewer flats available for rent. 
As such, it's not implausible that some owners might take some risks.
 
Tenants nowadays are also more savvy, and would almost certainly ask to see proof that the claimed owner does indeed own the flat/property before they pay any deposit/rental. They will likely ask for property tax bill and the owner's NRIC to be sure it's not a con job.
 
And the agent should obviously assess the prospective tenants' background before brokering any deal.
 
Having said that, if the tenant wants to play punk, it's also tricky. They pay a month's deposit for a year's contract, but if they want to terminate the lease early, and the owner refuses, then what if they just drag the last month's rental payment and run away (only) when the owner/agent starts chasing? In the meantime, maybe they will empty the house of anything of value! The owner/landlord might have considered such a scenario, which will mean extreme inconvenience and obviously additional cost to furnish the flat again - and so might just relent when asked...

Yes, and hence the kopitiam talk 
 
From these "experts" here where the ease of doing it is
 
1. HDB will boh hui and boh chap and only refer to the tanancy agreement as well as the landlord. Any 3 long 2 short, it does not mean anything to the people who does the scheming and the planning
 
2. The police is quite powerless to do anything because the police will see this as more of a ICA issue as well as a domestic issue.
 
3. ICA will not take action because there is no evidence of illegal staying, just like AirBnB because its a commercial issue.
 
So all in all, its quite safe lah. Can go ahead. Its quite risk free to them, But not the landlord. So the "Agent" can still do whatever they want, however they want.

Eviction and confiscating of deposit, fine, plus sudden displacement are risks the tenants take if they intend to sublet illegally. Two agents have been charged over this.
 
http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/duo-charged-over-illegal-home-rental-under-new-regulations
 
The fine can be $10,000 per day of illegal subletting. Why risk this just to earn $100-$200 a day?

3 men convicted last month of harbouring immigration offenders, sentenced to no less than six months of imprisonment

SINGAPORE — The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) today (July 10) reminded homeowners to exercise due diligence in checking the status of their prospective foreign tenants to ensure that their status in Singapore is legal.
Three men were convicted in June of harbouring immigration offenders under Section 57(1)(d) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133) and were each sentenced to no less than six months of imprisonment, the ICA said in a release.

If all relatives can exceed 6 occupiers. Even domestic helper is considered part of the family.
 
Cheng hu doesn't anyhow send people to jail lah or make things difficult for families. The biggest landlord in Singapore is cheng hu leh.
 
Understand this point, and a lot of things are easy to do.
 
In fact, even Sentosa bungalow, the maximum occupier is still 6 per unit. Private property cap is also 6, announced last year.

The authorities also do background checks when the tenant is registered. 
In fact they check much more thoroughly.
 
One will only be penalised heavily if he wants to save agent fees, don’t declare income from rent, etc. Then end up with problematic tenants.

ok,, I see where you coming from. What you are saying is go under the radar and rent out the place, yet dont inform that the place is tananted out.
 
Highly impossible. I quite law abiding. Earn that saving in taxes is not worth the long term hassle. Tanant nowadays are well conversant of the Singapore law leaning towards the Tanant then the landlord.
 
HDB is also targetting the landlord as well.
 
And ICA dont even want to provide a case number..lol so its pretty easy to go un notice.
 
What I fear most is the recent unknown element in our mist may create alot of opportunity if left uncheck.

In fact, my tenants’ employers issue warnings for them not to sublet especially to illegal immigrants, as this will jeopardise their employment pass validity. 
So if go through legal path and properly registered, it will be very safe. The whole system is designed to smoke out illegal immigrants.
 
If try to save here save there then make sure you check properly (somehow).

One will only be penalised heavily if he wants to save agent fees, don’t declare income from rent, etc. Then end up with problematic tenants.

 
I understand that a lot of the tenants, especially those who are married, will from time to time have relatives visiting SG. Parents might come over stay a week, then in-laws will do the same at another time. Is this allowed?
 
Plus if it is a 4-room flat, which is rented out to 6 pax (2 per room), then suddenly got a couple (the parents) come over, and the tenants ask for permission to let them stay one week - can or not leh?

Sengkang flat illegally leased on Airbnb gets discovered by taxi driver after picking up tourists
CK TAN
STOMP  Mar 09, 2018
 
 

A taxi driver accidentally stumbled upon a flat in Sengkang which had been illegally leased out on Airbnb, while he was ferrying some tourists from Changi Airport on Tuesday (March 7).
 
The cabby alerted Shin Min Daily News to the incident on Wednesday (March 8) and reporters later spoke to the owner of the flat who said that she was unaware that such leasing was illegal.
 
According to the cabby, Mr Hong, the tourists asked to head to Sengkang.
 
He said: "Those two tourists directly passed me an invoice retrieved from Airbnb that had the address on it.
 
"When I found out that this was a Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat, I started feeling that something was wrong.
 
"I remember that according to regulations, it is illegal to lease out HDB flats for short-term stays."
 
After taking a look at the invoice, Mr Hong told the tourists that the destination they were headed to was not a hotel, nor was it a residential unit allowed for short-term stays under the regulations.
 
However, the tourists replied that the owner of the flat was also staying in the flat with them.
 
Mr Hong continued: "When we arrived at Fernvale Link in Sengkang, I realised that the place was really an HDB flat. I started questioning myself if the regulations have changed."
 
Reporters later found a listing of the unit based on a photo of the invoice sent by Mr Hong.
 
They discovered that the owner charged $42 a night for one room, and there were 45 positive reviews on the listing.
 
After that, the reporters paid a visit to the flat.
 
The female owner of the flat said that she was unclear if this was against regulations, and thought that it was fine for her to rent out her room.
 
She said: "We looked at the Airbnb website and found that so many other people renting out their houses."
 
When reporters searched on Airbnb for the listing again on Wednesday (March 7), they found that it had been taken down.

Many try to pretend to be a virgin.
 
Can not blame them after not getting caught
 
As long as its civil and not criminal, the authorities like the police cannot do anything.
 
Let us move on.

If rent out whole unit can claim interest rebate. 
Depends on the unit and size, the amount can be huge as well.
 
Lock 1 rm cannot I think. Income tax lower but actual rent collected is also lower.

property is fully paid. hence, interest rebate is no use. the consideration is rental tax whether property is owner occupied or not (very high tax). can 1 owner justify that he stay in multiple property?

Authorities are not silly.
 
1 couple can only declare stay in one property.

oh yah, property tax should be quite different between own stay and rented out. 
Plus subject to income tax too?
 
wah, many infringements... really daring...

I hope all this illegal subletting and short term rental landlords get caught and fined heavily.

Yup, I would do the same.
 
The problem is how to identify such short-term tenants. We need an efficient and effective way to sieve them out and then nab the owner.

Sounds like you know this neighbour decently well.
 
And i can fully understand the concern of upsetting good neighbourly relations.
 
If you really wanna preserve the good relations, and want it - if it's really AirBnB - to stop, then maybe you might want to find a 'chance' to talk to your neighbour, and say something like you want to let him know that some people are probing about him, and bluff him say got reporters ask you about his place the day before, and you said not aware of anything; so now just want to let him know about it.
 
That way, he should only thank you for not sabo'ing him, and also by right start to be more careful about doing it again.

Thousands of hdb occupants flouting hdb law by placing their rubbish along corridors,  burning incense along corridors, nailing fixtures along hdb corridors, keeping cats in hdb, using hdb for all kinds of business (hairdressing,  warehouse,  pet lodging etc), renting rooms but not declaring income etc etc etc how come never hear people get caught for these things? Those who use airbnb is just a tiny fraction compared to those I mentioned.

Maybe those were caught too but given warning or a simple fine. So not reported in the press.

Singaporeans so kiasi if people get fined jialat jialat you think the entire country's hdb blocks will have corridors cluttered with rubbish?  I dare say 100% of hdb blocks in singapore have personal items along the corridors on every single floor and a large majority of hdb blocks with landlords renting out their flats do not declare their rental income for income tax.

They have been renting out the units since late 2015. What is $120K?
 
Somemore they are property agents I don't think these are the only units they have in their hands.

The pair, whose licenses have been revoked by the Council of Estate Agencies, had regularly advertised the units on online platforms such as home-sharing site Airbnb for between $198 to $335 per night. The pair admitted that they earned $19,000 over a period of five weeks.

govt auctions the property. proceeds goes to Comm Chest.
 
but the owner will still have to settle o/s loans with the banks.

You are taxed ar source in singapore. If your online business is registered in singapore,  you need to pay tax.  Of course whether you declare or not is another thing.

I thought AirBNB is illegal. The agent was caught,  the owner may receive warning letter though not punished
