Hi all,
 

Apartment gonna TOP soon, so am looking out for furnitures....
 

Any suggestion where I can find nice furnitures with good prices?
 

I am more for design and quality of course, but feels that those shops at Park Mall charge too high a premium for what they have. 
 

Not saying it has to be dirt cheap (ikea is out for sure), I dont mind paying a little more if it is really good value for money. 
 

Thanks!

The quality of ikea furniture has improved a lot over the years. Not all ikea furniture are cheap. Gotta do your research and buy the ones that suit your requirements and are good value for money.
 

If you really want quality, you can try Scanteak, rose wood or tiger wood furniture. They last a lifetime but cost a fortune.
 

Personally, I stick to ikea for all my furniture especially for those properties that are rented out.

All those are branches of the furniture chains such as Novena. No need to go so far as all their prices are the same for all the branches.

That place can find quite a few furniture shops, more easier to compare prices and variety as it is located within the same area.

I dont really like to buy ikea furniture cause it is not cheap for some items and also need to install ourselves. Unless you pay a fee for them to install for you. But if you refer furniture used in rented, maybe ikea might be a good choice for small items like table and sofa bed.

Don't really agree as I have bought a cabinet recently. Some parts already wearing off and realized the door is not straight.

I agree, rather pay more for good funitures than on ID. I feel that a few really well chosen piece of furniture will add more to the house than ID stuffs. So deciding to do lesser ID and spend more on furniture.
 

yah was walking around parkmall last weekend. Saw this kitchen table set that I really liked. Table about 7k and chair at 1.1k a pop...
 

And also sofa, about 8k after discount. Just that before I commit, would wanna check if there's alternatives.. because after asking, these are locally built also, not like they are imported from italy and are signature designs from renowned designers.
 

How about picket and rail or lush?

yes. ikea stuffs really cannot make it.
 

1. my standing lamp, the base made of rubber powderised after 2 yrs

2. Book shelf, but the shelves arent designed to hold the weight! After a few books, the panels start to sag!

3. Drawer cabinets. The base of each drawer sags and affect the drawer below it.
 

I dont know what the designers at Ikea do. they come up with the design, but functionally it doesnt work.

Air's pieces are going for much lesser than the prices you quoted. I have no affiliation with them btw.
 

Picket and Rail is kinda more laid back resort style. I like contemporary designs. It depends on what you're after.

Really ?  The one just after a petrol kiosk and is one building by itself at Thomson Road, end of AMK Ave 1  ? If so, then your taste must be very high, or mine is bad.  but i suspect you may have went to another one, anyway, they have one in sing post building also.

I bought 2 small desks from Ikea at $30 each and placed (free) black galaxy granite on them. The black galaxy granite were free because they were loose pieces that were left over. I just got the company to cut the granite to my desired size and polish the edges. So far so good leh!

Assuming you are not going for high-end stuffs, you can consider Picket & Rail & Vhive. Both make quality furniture that last. 
 

My cheap Vhive TV cabinet is still going very strong after 10 years.

oh yes, that is another one.  the showroom at thomson is very big and has many products, and i find some of them really nice.  i urge you to check it out (after all you drive and it is not far from yck anyway).  They have some very nice sofas, many dinning table and chairs design, and designer replicas as well. it is possible the yck branch do not have the full range.

For mattress, just buy cheap pocketed spring (less than $1K) and change every 3 years.
 

Mattresses should not be kept for more than 3 years for hygiene. A lot of creepy crawlers feed on our dead cells and live deep within our mattresses. They may cause a person to develop massive allergy problems.

See no further, buy and chao!

There is a "best" furniture shop.
I found my furniture from all over Singapore.
Some designer pieces shipped in from Italy and Switzerland, others customed made in Bangkok and Phillippines.
 
So the fun is to move around.  some shops are good for chairs, others good for tables and others good for cabinets.
 
There are also many shops in Tan Boon Liat building selling decently made and priced furniture.
If you like designer quality, can try dream.com.sg

Best furniture is hoots online. Big savings compared with buying in SG stores. Go SG shop see see look look, get lousy/no service, thereafter go online hoots. https://www.scandinaviandesigncenter.com/   (free worldwide shipping above 99usd)
 
andhttps://www.connox.com/If u hoots enough $$$ at Connox (above 750euros), email them, you get free shipping to SG.  Similar items selling here almost double the price you can get online. Both Scandinaviandesigncenter and Connox customer service also top notch. SG no fight.

http://www.comfortfurniture.com.sg - Cheap and good, also got replicas. They are like a mini Ikea, very well organised, can be crowded on weekends. I didn't even know this place exists until I was shopping for my reno.
 
http://www.thecommunelife.com - mid ranged pricing, nice designs with decent materials. Bought my sofa there. Their theme is mostly towards dark wooden, leather furniture. The ulu defu lane showroom has more stuffs to see than the atas millenia walk store.
 
http://danishdesignco.com.sg - Lots of beautiful and original designs, super good workmanship, prices also make you very high. I was looking at dining chairs, can be anything from $600 to $1k. Per chair hor. Sofa set can be $7k upwards. Good for ppl who are allergic to cheap furniture. Nearly bought some stuffs there but was afraid I might get blisters on my cheap ass after sitting on the expensive leather for too long.
 
Tan boon liat bldg also got many choices, from low to high end stuffs.

Hmm comfort considered cheap ar.
 
I would say they are at the high end of entry level bah. Most of their chairs are quite a bit more expensive than other shops.
But i still bought my dressing table stool and my 4 dining chairs from them. The chairs were pretty expensive compared to other normal replica chairs out there. But are well made.
 
I bought from them cos really can sit your kar cheng on every chair they have and buy the one u like most

If I remember correctly, I saw Zara home furnishings in Paris.
Nothing awesome... quality also meh... their bed cover label says 400 thread counts, macam 4 like that...
 
I've also recently made some furniture scouting. Been to Comfort furnishing... not impressed, also certain of their designs similar to others outside are priced higher by ~$50. Sofas also too hard.
 
So far, I think the best sofas I've tried are from HTL, damn soft... can rot on them until really rot I think. Some of their items are also cheaper... aiming for their dining chairs... I think about $100+ per chair after discounts.
 
Also, can take a look at Contempo. Decent quality, but I think their prices are not cheap. Bought a full leather, L1.96M, D90cm sofa from them for about $2099. I think Luzerne also not bad.

You are right, Comfort is more atas entry level.  But considering I wrote this right after shopping at too many Italiano-furniture-that-I-can't-afford type of stores, everything at Comfort seems suddenly so affordable.  It's similar to having COE at $80K for so long, now COE at $60K everyone say cheap cheap lor.
 
Another place at Tan Boon Liat building with beautiful solid wood furnitures is http://www.mountainteak.com. Their prices are not exorbitant considering they use solid wood with good workmanship and some interesting industrial designs too.

Super dishonest. Spoke to the manager and he say same thing. Must pay $100 for the delivery. When I buy say liao need to climb stairs, now say got extra charge. 
 
 
What can I do now? Cannot cancel as I paid full liao and receipt no write free delivery. Dont tell me go Case, ah.

depends on how you want to play 
got time at hand play until they surrender
 
 
when deliver check everything ok
one tiny scratch reject
colour off some areas especially leather  don't accept ~ if they say leather like that tell them very obvious in your living room with bright sunlight
if sofa scratch your wall complain
 
sooner or later they will refund you your 100 or even reimburse you further
 
most important cannot let the delivery man disappear  until you get everything settled
otherwise game over
 
 
sometimes it is the principles and not playing games

Thanks for the idea. I asked my estate ah neh to help me carry. Gave him $20. Rather give him than those delivery guys. Don't wish to pay them any extra.
 
BTW, the shop is Mr Decor from IMM level 3. Buy from them with caution, make sure what is said is written on the receipt.

No. Staying in old walk-up apartment.Oh I see.. I had a similar experience.. bought king mattress and was told delivery free.. lift level so no extra charges..  but when delivery team came , they told me king mattress cannot fit in my lift.. so each level $10.. I stay in 21st floor... 
Called up shop and they said must pay as the money goes to delivery shop and not to them. But I told them when I bought you said no extra charges since mine is a lift level unit 
 
Argued and told them how to pay $210 for delivery when my mattress is cheaper than that? Ding dong 3 hours later , free delivery. 
 
Delivery team had to cancel other orders to solve my issue. Felt sad for them but not for my mattress company

When we lived in HK we had a spiral staircase up to the second floor.
 
We bought a lovely King size bed and mattress without thinking too much about getting it into the bedroom.
 
Eventually the delivery guys hoisted it up to the bedroom window which luckily had a small balcony and then in through the bedroom double doors.
 
Luckily I was working when the bed was delivered but my missus said the delivery guys were very good and didn't cause any problems.
 
Now when we moved back to Singapore somehow my missus rented a house in Mayflower which also had a spiral staircase etc.
The Local delivery guys here kicked up a big row about having to get the bed etc upstairs.
