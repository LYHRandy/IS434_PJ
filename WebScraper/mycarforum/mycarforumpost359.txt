I know we have a separate property thread, but IMO, this deserves a separate discussion.
 
This area will be big, in size and impact..

PM Lee says Greater Southern Waterfront will feature both private and public housing, area will be twice size of Punggol
RACHEL AU-YONG, POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT
Aug 19, 2019 06:00 am

  
 
 
 

About 9,000 housing units - both public and private - will be built on the site of Keppel Club as part of the future Greater Southern Waterfront (GSW), said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
There will be private and public housing elsewhere too, he added yesterday during his National Day Rally speech, confirming for the first time that the mega waterfront development will have Housing Board flats.
In sketching out what the GSW will look like, Mr Lee said the entire area will be twice the size of Punggol town.
"Think of it as Punggol by the Bay," he quipped.
First announced in 2013, the GSW comprises 30km of coastline stretching from the Bay East area to Pasir Panjang.
 
It contains 2,000ha of land - six times the size of Marina Bay and twice the size of Punggol.



 

 
Mr Lee noted that prime land will be freed up for redevelopment after PSA moves its city terminals in Tanjong Pagar, Keppel and Pulau Brani to Tuas by 2027, as well as Pasir Panjang terminal by 2040.

 
The moves will "be an opportunity to reshape the GSW into a new place to live, work and play", he said.
On the housing element, Keppel Club will become one of the first developments in the zone, he said, showing an artist's impression of what the area would look like, though he added in jest the homes would not pop up "quite so fast".
The private golf club, whose lease expires in two years and which sits on a 44ha plot, is in between two MRT stations and near Labrador Nature Reserve.
The waterfront will be a commercial node, said Mr Lee, noting several big companies have offices near Labrador Park, such as Google, Cisco and Unilever.
"We will develop more office space in the GSW... which will bring in more jobs," he said.
"People can work near where they live, and live near where they work. This will create life and activity during the day and at night."	RECREATION OPTIONSMr Lee also highlighted the recreation options that will come into the area, starting with the redevelopment of two old power stations in Pasir Panjang.
The authorities launched a competition calling for ideas and winning proposals will be showcased at the end of the year.
Mr Lee also announced the possibility of a "Downtown South" resort on Pulau Brani.
On how these plans came about, Mr Lee said during a Cabinet meeting, labour chief Ng Chee Meng had asked: "NTUC is very grateful to the Government for Downtown East. How about a Downtown South?"
Mr Ng was referring to the labour movement-run lifestyle hub in Pasir Ris that hosts, among other things, a resort, amusement park, event spaces and shops.
"I said, okay, we will do that," Mr Lee said last night.
Pulau Brani is between the main island of Singapore and Sentosa, near Keppel Harbour.
A large part of the island makes up the current Brani Terminal, which is among the PSA city terminals that will move to the Tuas mega port by 2027.
"We will make this gesture, to thank our workers for all their contributions to the nation, because Singapore is for all of us," said Mr Lee.
 
Meanwhile, Sentosa's beach areas will be revitalised while its nature and heritage trails will be expanded.
The GSW will be linked up to surrounding green areas, such as from West Coast Park to East Coast Park, and connecting the Rail Corridor and Sentosa.
"With a new green heart in the centre, Singapore will be even more of a City in a Garden," Mr Lee said.

SINGAPORE: New attractions are being planned for Pulau Brani, similar to Universal Studios Singapore on Sentosa, announced Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday (Aug 18).
The island, currently home to Brani Terminal, will be set aside for “fun and recreation” as part of the Government’s plans to remake Singapore’s Greater Southern Waterfront (GSW), he said in his National Day Rally speech.
 
 
 
 
Mr Lee added that a resort could also be built on Pulau Brani, with land set aside for the labour movement.
“When we discussed these plans in Cabinet, Ng Chee Meng put his hand up. He said: ‘NTUC is very grateful to the Government for Downtown East. How about a Downtown South?’
“So I said: ‘Okay, we will do that’.”
 
He said this gesture was to thank workers for their contribution to the nation.
READ: Sentosa Island, Pulau Brani development plans in the worksOther than Pulau Brani, the Government also has plans to rejuvenate Sentosa Island, and redevelop two decommissioned power stations in Pasir Panjang.
 
 
 
“We will also revitalise Sentosa’s beach areas and expand its nature and heritage trails, to keep its island character,” said Mr Lee at the rally.
He added that the Government will “find creative new uses” for the two power stations.
In addition, there are plans to improve Singapore’s greenery by linking the GSW with the surrounding green areas. West Coast Park and East Coast Park will be connected, and so will the Rail Corridor and Sentosa Island.
“With a new green heart at the centre, Singapore will be even more of a City in a Garden,” he said.
Apart from recreation, the Government also hopes to develop residential and commercial properties in the GSW, said Mr Lee.“WORK NEAR WHERE THEY LIVE, AND LIVE NEAR WHERE THEY WORK”
One of the first developments will be on the plot occupied by the Keppel Club, whose lease will expire in two years’ time.
It will be remade into a residential quarter with both public and private housing.

SINGAPORE: Measures such as shorter leases and longer minimum occupancy periods (MOP) might help to mitigate the “lottery effect” of public housing at the Greater Southern Waterfront (GSW), experts said.
This follows the announcement by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday that there are plans to build 9,000 private and public housing units on the site of the current Keppel Club when its lease expires in two years’ time.

“By 2027, the city terminals will go to Tuas where we are building a new port, and later on in 2040, the Pasir Panjang Terminal will also go to Tuas Port," said Mr Lee.
“This will free up prime land for redevelopment. It will be an opportunity to reshape the GSW into a new place to live, work and play.”

I read it again and indeed it is exciting times.
 
The 9000 units only represents part of two Punggol sized sites in the vicinity.
 
It will be a whole ecosystem of its own for the next generation, after 2040.

This whole site will be moved to Tuas yes?

A group of my friends were talking about climate change being discussed by PM... as one guy is in the field...
 
And that's real concerns that with climate change, ice will melt an sea level will rise. Even a maybe 2 m rise in sea level, will mean a lot of problem for SG... esp. the areas by the.... water  [sweatdrop]

The property around these developments will have positive and negative effects..
IMO the FH and especially the landed enclaves in the area stand to benefit..
If you are into F&B, there are thousands of new customers 
Vivocity stands to gain too. I’m sure there will be new malls in the region too..

typical property bulls mentality lah
 
they think property will appreciate at x% every year so income will definitely match or surpass the appreciation.....no matter what
 
my guess is it will...but supported by more and more richies brought into the country buying multiple atas properties
 
peasants will remain mostly in their ah beng infested slums
 
the social divide is just gonna get wider and wider

Actually 80+% of private property bought by Singaporeans still.
 
So many of us started our lives from HDB that I have lost count.
 
My thinking is your guess is largely not representative of the experience of the populace.
 
Super atas property like bungalows in the sky and GCB sites maybe true to an extent but not for most of the case. 
 
And for those cases where foreigners bear such a huge % of the tax burden for us, why not? We will continue with our low(er) tax situation and be fully dependent on the retirement packages and goodies prepared for us. Still a comfortable life no matter what.

thats what everyone said when vivocity was built. the surrounding condos didnt really see their prices appreciate beyond what the general market prices that went up.
 
in the end, only GCBs are sure win. prices keep going up and up. the rich get richer.

The point is that everyone can be happy where they are. 
People are happy to live in their choices, whether HDB, condo or landed.
 
Those who invest gain according to the risk they undertake.
 
For ultra atas, they pay much more in taxes (undertake much more risks) and they gain much more. But not everyone can afford to invest the way they do.
 
Fair to everyone.

Call me optimistic.. 
The way we are lapping up 2000 psf flats elsewhere is making me optimistic about this place.
Either from greed or sheer kiasuism, Singaporeans are still queuing up and buying property at the current sky high prices as if the prices will always rise.
And this is the place where there is potential upside. 
I don't think it will be 3000 psf, otherwise the government will be called to task. Some high end unit might be very expensive but the HDB units have to be priced under 1000 psf, or have 30-50 year leases..
Interlace? Nice design but when you look at it in detail, it's not well connected, and it's quite pricey now, with the same money you can buy something else with a MRT nearby for example..

Historically, 2-3% annual appreciation has been the story and is the obvious current continual long term target. Inflation continues at around that rate as well, assuming MAS does not suddenly adjust to zero appreciation policy.
 
Every batch of graduate also attains a higher point of starting salary.
 
There is a range for everyone and a different appreciation pathway for all.
 
In any case, in 2049, we can expect graduates to earn starting salary at between 6K to 7K.

They will sell site by site over decades. Every square inch will be coveted. 
But the climate defence needs to go hand in hand as well.

Whether it happens that way, it's still a few decades away and is irrelevant to most of us.
 
What's more important is what we do from today up to that day, that's more relevant and important.

Actually the effect will slowly but steadily come. Sure some of us will be old by then.
But now is the time to invest, or look at it. 
I told a charitable group I work with, if the volunteers took cabs together home and gave the excess money back (they gave us the fare), it's money to hire more people or money to give back to the people. 
A little goes a long way when you add it all up..

Is this reclaimed land?
 
A group of my friends were talking about climate change being discussed by PM... as one guy is in the field...
 
And that's real concerns that with climate change, ice will melt an sea level will rise. Even a maybe 2 m rise in sea level, will mean a lot of problem for SG... esp. the areas by the.... water  [sweatdrop] 

 
Publicly, we are late in realisation of rising seawater especially we are an island without much high ground.

The Govt was deciding when to announce and make it a national priority when the signs are clearer.
 
Some developments had already incorporated it in their design as early as 2010s.
 
Elevation by at least 1m in relation to surrounding developments is one such measure.

Anyone think that this GSW might be a ghost city? 
With 2x punggol size, priced over $3000psf, who will be the takers? Added with ABSD it will be quite hard to sell, even interlace and reflections not fully soldafter completedforyears
Shouldn’t be that ex. 
The first project in the GSW which is called Avenue South Residences is supposed to be launched at an average of 18xx psf. Preview supposed to be next Saturday and official launch the following week

Frankly the amenities in the vicinity within walking distance is nothing to shout about.
By the time GSW is more developed, it’s another 10 year old (or more) project and people’s attention will be shifted to newer developments.

Avenue South is off Kampong Bahru, which is a km plus to Vivo City. Not that far. GSW is in Dist 4 and not really central region. The condos along Keppel Bay can’t really sell high too. Rem Reflections? How many people bought it at 2500psf and above and now many have to sell at a loss at below 2000psf. Skyline and Coral Keppel Bay are high in asking but can sell or not at that price is anybody’s Guess. I don’t believe Dist 4 properties are that highly sought after

Actually the older and overpriced units will suffer..
If the new units are priced right, it will make it harder to sell the older units, especially if the net price is higher due to their bigger sizes..

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/spotlight-on-lottery-effect-of-flats-slated-for-keppel-club-site
 

 
The prospect of public and private apartments being built on the prime land now hosting the Keppel Club and its 18-hole golf course is prompting questions of how to mitigate the "lottery effect" of what are likely to be prized assets.
The land will accommodate about 9,000 apartments after the land lease for the 115-year-old country club expires on Dec 31, 2021. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong confirmed at the National Day Rally that the Keppel strip of the 30km Greater Southern Waterfront will be used for Housing Board flats.
While the public and private split for the planned 9,000 units is not clear, property experts expect the HDB flats to be oversubscribed - just like the wildly popular Pinnacle @ Duxton in Tanjong Pagar.
And that has raised the question of whether buyers should be allowed to reap handsome profits for taxpayer-subsidised homes.
When Pinnacle @ Duxton was launched in 2004, there were nearly 5,000 applications for 1,848 units, which were eventually allocated by ballot. Getting a unit was like winning the lottery. And some have indeed hit the jackpot.
A five-room Pinnacle unit on a high floor that would have sold for between $345,100 and $439,400 at the launch went for $1.12 million in 2016. There were 18 Pinnacle flats that sold for more than $1 million last year.
 
 	ANOTHER LOTTERY IN THE OFFING?The high market value of city units like those in the Pinnacle @ Duxton had sparked questions about equity, as the flats are heavily subsidised and securing a unit is largely down to chance.
 
Property experts interviewed by The Straits Times agreed that the HDB flats in Keppel would be priced higher than flats in most other areas, given its green and seafront environment and proximity to the city.
Dr Lee Nai Jia, head of research at consultancy Knight Frank, said a new five-room flat on the Keppel plot would probably start at around $800,000, assuming existing conditions apply and the market stays as it is.

He based his estimate on median resale prices of five-room HDB flats in Queenstown, which are now around $800,000.
Real estate analyst Vijay Natarajan of RHB Securities Singapore said: "The new five-room (Keppel) HDB could be priced anywhere between $700,000 and $950,000 depending on its location, views and (the) floor it is on."
In 2016, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong had said the Government was looking at selling future public housing within the city under a different model to address the lottery effect in a "fair and equitable" way.
Referring to the Pinnacle @ Duxton, Mr Wong said then: "I think to do more (public) housing in the city under the same regime would not be plausible, and we shouldn't do it... I have to sell it potentially with different parameters."
Possible measures could include a longer minimum occupation period (MOP), a shorter lease or higher resale levy, he had said.
Such measures could kick in for the new Keppel development, said property experts.
"The objective is to create diversity and encourage vibrancy in the area," said Dr Lee of Knight Frank. "To create community and identity of the area, young owners need to stay there long enough. A natural extension will be to raise the minimum occupation period to 10 years."
Owners of HDB flats can sell their units only after living there for at least five years.
Mr Natarajan recommended that the MOP for such prime HDB sites be raised to between eight and 10 years. "This would encourage more participation from genuine long-term home owners and limit investor/speculator demand."
A longer MOP will also help curb profits from renting out Keppel units.
Marketing director Anna Yeo of property agency SLP said: "Now, an HDB owner can rent out a unit after an MOP of five years. The MOP should be lengthened to 71/2 years or even more."
While there have been suggestions for HDB to reduce its standard 99-year lease to as low as 30 years for such prime units to deter profiteering and speculation, Ms Yeo did not think such a measure would work.
"The Government wants everyone to have a home and not to use it for speculation. So, lengthening the MOP is a better measure than shortening the lease," she noted.
Another suggestion, said Dr Lee, is to make the owners reimburse part of the subsidies they enjoyed when they eventually sell their flats.

						Many ways to redevelop Greater Southern Waterfront
					







							
								 
							







The Tanjong Pagar and Pulau Brani container terminals are part of the Greater Southern Waterfront (GSW) area, slated for rejuvenation. Stretching over more than 30km of Singapore's southern coastline, the GSW offers over 2,000ha of land for potential redevelopment, almost six times that of Marina Bay.PHOTO: AFP



				 
			





								 
							










							The recent announcement of redevelopment around the Pasir Panjang area is an exciting one. Apart from housing, there are many other options to redevelop this area.
						

							First, there is the Pasir Panjang Power Station, a very large building with a cavernous interior. How about using it as a film studio?
						

							Film-making is a high-yield industry with little pollution, and we are already making significant contributions to the field of computer animation.
						

							It may be time to offer Singapore as an alternative to the renowned Pinewood Studios in Britain. We can be the link to Asia and offer indoor as well as outdoor scenic shots.
						

							Second, moving the ports to the Tuas area should be a concerted effort. The smoke stacks adjacent to the port at Pulau Bukom should also be moved to make the environment truly suitable for a sporting, healthy lifestyle.
						

							How about retaining the deep water facilities at the Pasir Panjang Port to be used as a marina? Then build a world-class arena for competitive watersport?
						

							 
						

							 
						

							Third, as we move towards longer employment and a greater focus on re-education and acquiring new skills, this area can also be a centre for arts, education as well as the proposed recreation facilities. So instead, why not build a new tertiary education centre in the middle of the Greater Southern Waterfront? Perhaps one which focuses more on film-making and related skills, or one that teaches culinary and hospitality skills.
						

							Finally, we must consider the implication of grouping 9,000 new housing units into a rather compact space in the Keppel area.
						

							This has many downstream effects on congestion, and the entire area around it could face severe demands on the infrastructure.
						

							We should learn from the negative effects of building multiple condominiums in the Telok Kurau area, which resulted in massive jams, and our experience in Punggol, where the construction of infrastructure like markets and malls did not keep pace with the influx of new residents.
						

							Having a diversified use of the land will give us more vibrancy and variety, and help put us in an even more positive light internationally.

	Even without bringing any political or nationalist element to this, i think it's very unlikely there is such a need. 


	Runs contrary to current global economic observations. Cities is where economic vibrancy is.  If u can stuff 10-15mil inside a city with acceptable standards, the better.  There's no need to have a city of 5 million with a 10 million population hinterland.

	Indonesia has demonstrated the will to move their capital with a few million people together with it. It can be can.


	The rising China and the constant conflict between USA-China are some issues pushing for a great alliance among ASEAN countries. How this alliance is forged is never to be under-estimated. From our history, leaders literally slept with the enemy to achieve their own goals. 


	I have always believe the ambition of our leaders are often beyond our own shores. The separation was regrettable.

	Barring geopolitical situation, there's no economic sense to move people out from a well organised (even if it's crowded) city out into a hinterland. At most a neighbouring city is required in certain metropolises.
	Johor serves our needs well. Though of course,  the links between JB and Singapore could be way more maximised to have seamless connectivity. There's a reason Johor and Singapore have a special relationship even beyond SG govt-KL central govt relationship. 


	Think, 
	Seoul-Suwon
	Manhattan-the surrounding boroughs
	Tokyo-yokohama
	Taipei-Taoyuan 
	To buy land, no need. To allow Singaporeans and Johoreans to have residency status without immigration control over the border would be pretty awesome. But it would have been more feasible in the earlier years when the economic status is not of such great disparity. Now such an economically vested partnership is too lopsided to have an ideal situation.

	Not all leh. 1.2 mil EC means 900k loan. which is abt 4.5k repayment per month. You can use roughly 2.6k from CPF OA so only 2k cash.


	Plus first few years payment will be reduced during construction period.

	downpayment 300k aside, buying a property close to 10 times annual hh income isn't really considered a role model for financial prudence unless savings buffer is huge

	I think there could be a lot of factors beyond rich parents landing a hand.


	For downpayment wise, not that difficult to save 150k each after working for about 5 years - it all depends on your saving pattern.


	For monthly payments, 1.2 mil is actually about 8 times annual income (assuming 3 mths bonus). It also depends on which stage of your career you are in, how stable the job/industry is and also your opportunities for advancement. More importantly, must know what your expenses are - if you are currently making 12k and spending only 5k, then it is okay. But if you are spending 10k then you might not be able to afford it.

	$900k+ loan with about 2.5% interest should be around $3.6k a month over 30 years.


	There is a maintenance fee of around $300-400 per month and property taxes as well.


	Hence, the total cost per month (excluding downpayment) is $4k, which $2.6k from CPF and $1.4k from cash.


	The trick is how to get $300k+ for the downpayment.


	Both parties should be working and they cannot afford to lose their jobs.  In addition, their CPF accounts will remain empty in their 50s if they service the loan partially via CPF.


	It is not easy to own an EC these days for the middle class with EC prices similar to private condominiums just 5 years ago.

	so a young prudent couple without rich parents conscientiously saving for many years would suddenly splash out their entire savings and commit to the next 30 years loan to  buy a 1.2m penthouse ec?


	seems quite out of character don't you think?

	I differentiate between having rich parents who pay for the kids and having parents who can act as backup.


	In any case, I have demonstrated that 12k combined salary is enough to afford the 1.2 mil EC leh. Now you add in prudence into the argument...

	In essence it is a matter of risk taking.


	High risk, high gain or loss.


	Low risk, low gain or loss.


	Most important factor to ask is how much we trust the future success of SG. 


	If we believe strongly in it, why take such an unconfident wager? Such as if we believe it will always be a special place and willing to pay higher prices for a HDB. 


	If we don’t believe in the future of it, then renting is a preferable position to minimise our stakes. 


	HDB ownership is a medium confident stake.


	Between staking a HDB hold versus a private LH hold or a FH hold, the major difference is a matter of how much one can afford to risk. Private affordability has to be persistently tagged to earning incomes of the top 30 percent or so.

	What's wrong with saving 300k in 5 years?


	Some people are spenders, some are savers.  


	You mean someone making 12k and saving no money is more deserving of subsidy than someone making 12k and saving 300k? I think it should be based on income and not savings.

	You mentioned a few times that 12k income cannot buy unless paid for by parents. I merely want to show you that it is wrong and 12k income can indeed pay for it out of their own pocket.

	Exactly right. With no existing mortgage and with CPF contributions, 300K in 5 years is easily accomplished with max 12K household income. Just save 3K in cash and 2K in OA every month.


	Don’t include interests also reach 300K.

	We need roughly 10,000 new HDB and 8,000 new private annually just to keep things from blowing off the top.


	What’s the big deal about 150,000 units coming fully on stream by about 2050-2070 (based on KSY)? Moreover, this piece of land is likely going to be extra costly with additional height catered for the land reclaimed and raised.

	Mr Ku is concerned about whether the population can grow fast enough to fill up the houses and there are too many new developments going around e.g. Jurong Innovation District.


	Based on 0.5% population growth and 4 members per household, we need about 7,500 units per year.  Hence, I think the current newly launched 1/2-bedder units (typically >60% of the total units in a project) snapped up for investment could be on the over-supply side i.e. too many expensive units that cannot be supported by rental.


	Perhaps our economy is growing so slowly now that investors are pouring their money into traditionally safe properties as nothing else seems to be good these days, but I think it might be a trap in the next 2-3 years when the projects TOP.

	If 4 pax per unit is 7,500 units, 1-2 pax per unit will reach the numbers I reported.


	When people first buy a house, it is almost always 2 persons household formation.


	At the same time, in the background, there are still SERS and enbloc removing large units from the system.


	In 2010, it feels like a trap. In 2012, it feels like a trap. So does 2015 and 2017 and 2019. All these while, latent demand has continued to build up. With that kind of background, the property run will continue even skipping on one toe. 


	And even 2013-2015, it was an expected downturn because of historically it was the first time TDSR had been implemented at such a high bar.


	This is a different run from anything we have encountered in our history. It has been run in such a way that the supply has never met the true demand.

	One big area is the silver generation as the population ages. Healthcare for example.


	Tourism as the integrated resorts expand.


	Global hub as the airport terminals expand.


	Port growth for the new Tuas port facilities.


	People I know are just job hopping continually. There just aren’t enough jobs to go round (especially for Singaporeans).


	Doing more with less people also means paying much more for these people. From a private property pricing standpoint, this will play a supporting role.

	No doubt a beautiful area and very close to the city, and if I am reading right, an extension of the city to the Greater Southern Waterfront. So living in the city close to the sea, nature and work. 


	Just an observation that the Keppel Club land while may give some sea views and close to the sea side, actually has very little direct sea frontage. So they will be nothing like the Keppel Bay condos with direct sea frontage and owning the sea-fronting land / promenade. In fact, some of the Keppel Bay condos have canals with sea water running through, e.g. Reflections, Caribbean and Corals at Keppel Bay. So while there is a lot of excitement, I think must also temper expectations, in the sense that it is unlikely that these HDB flats will have the turquoise sea with luxury yachts right n their backyard like the Keppel Bay condos. Most of the sea fronting parts are already taken by Reflections /Caribbean at Keppel Bay and towards the west Labrador Park. Some of them own close to 1km of the coastline (but allow public access).

	The government has to make sure the pricing is equitable, or least allow some form of affordable housing elsewhere..


	In fact I prefer that the entire area is private, and let market forces determine the pricing. Then build affordable housing nearby or in other areas.


	Bottom line is we don't want to see HKG level pricing here..

			SINGAPORE: The Government is working out a new pricing model for future public housing in the Greater Southern Waterfront, in order to mitigate the so-called “lottery effect” of obtaining a subsidised flat in a prime area, said Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong on Thursday (Sep 19).
		

			His comments come after Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in his National Day Rally speech last month that the Government plans to build 9,000 private and public housing units on the site of the current Keppel Club when the lease expires in two years' time.
		

			READ: NDR 2019: New attractions, housing and office spaces to be developed in Greater Southern Waterfront
		

			READ: Specific measures could dampen 'lottery effect' of public housing at the Greater Southern Waterfront, experts say
		

			Several analysts had raised concerns on whether public housing in the Greater Southern Waterfront would create a “lottery effect”, where owners sell their units for far higher prices than initially purchased.
		

			Speaking to CNA938’s Arnold Gay and Yasmin Jonkers, Mr Wong said that the Government is still studying the best way to price future homes in the area.
