the loft units chio chio... tried applying for them years ago but the number i got was super duper big :(
 
 

 
Are these loft units,  the paired ones ie have to apply with parents?
If yes, then few questions that come to mind are:
 
1) What will happen to the studio unit when the parents pass on? Can't be selling to another old couple right cos I understand the door is 2 way ie you can access to the other unit even though they have separate entrances?
 
2) The studio units come with 99yr lease or the usual 30yr lease of normal studios? 
 
Apologies if the loft units are not the paired ones, thks!

OK thks!
 
Looking at the pics, if I'm not wrong the windows of the loft unit seem to look into the below unit?
If that is the case, where got privacy? Can't be right?
Or is that the standalone loft unit?

There is another smaller apartment that connects with a door on the upper level of the loft unit. The upper level with windows is the 2nd flr of one unit.

My take on Pinnacle is that the car park is rather dim esp during afternoons on overcast days.
Also there seems to be ponding of water in the car parks, guess the design doesn't allow much light in which in turn means water doesn't evaporate so easily.
 
That's the trouble with nice designs cos they can be impractical.

Sometimes too practical also got problem lah. there's always tradeoffs.
Like my flat, the block is N-S facing. All the rooms have decent light coming into each room, so won't have any room that's dark.
Lol but downside is kitchen, service yard, toilets all in the shade, no wind one.

Like that you must do some statistical analysis to see if it is true or not. Here, let me help you with some statistics.
 

 
The Government has consistently strived to maintain a lean and efficient Public Service. As at end 2014, the total staff strength of the Singapore Public Service, which includes ministries and statutory boards, was estimated at about 143,000[1], or about 4% of our labour force.[2][3]

loft unit is not 30 years, 30 years is the unit connected to the loft unit.

the studio unit will b taken back by hdb n the connecting door sealed up. n it's on 30yrs lease. there r paired units n also standalone unit for the lofts. 

 
Then like tat no good wor.  When the 30 yrs lease is up and govt seal the connecting door, then the loft unit above can see clearly what the units below are doing,  no privacy at all. 
the windows above is 1 of the room of the 4rm unit. not the studio apt. so 1st lvl there are 2 bedrooms, n 1 at 2nd lvl. studio apt will b on the other side.

Sky terrace looks nice from far, but i find the lift and carpark area looks very dark and dim even during daytime. Think due to the dark colour that they used on the wall?!

That means same like Pinnacle, see my post #11.
 
Perhaps the wall colour plays a part as well but I think the design is the main factor for Pinnacle though I'm not sure about Sky Terrace.

Queensway direction always traffic jam due to lots of cars going into AYE, but cars not only from queenstown area, they also comes from farrer rd nearby area.

thats the prob. that road already jam, then there will b cars coming fm kay siang joining the already jam road. it will then cause kay siang road to jam. n with 3 more bto/SERS coming and also abt 2 or 3 condo also being built, i can only say it will b chaotic in the morning.

Actually most places also always jam and chaotic during the morning peak, not only queensway area la.
