I know there are a lot of financial planners out there, but they are all selling something. I just want to seek some advice for people in my situation, what is the best way to proceed.  I currently have no liabilities (housing and car loan paid off), but staying in 4-room HDB. Wish to upgrade to private property, but I'm also concerned about risk since I am a single income family.
 
I'm not seeking advice on investments, but rather how much property I can afford based on my income level, net worth, and age.

in SG, not really.
There used to be a flat fee financial advisory agency. But not sure if they are still around.
 
Why not just read up?
 
I don't see the need to consult unless the financial planners are well versed in some details of insurance planning. And by then, u will be looking to buy something anyway.
For insurance, the closest thing is that the financial planner aka insurance agent is agent for several different companies and can offer the product best suited for u.

Pretty straight forward, go to those properties site like guruproperty and so on... 
 
They will have info for HDB upgraders.
 
In general, for bank loans, banks will look at several aspects of your income and wealth, ie total interest + repayment < 35% of monthly income, servicing period, load amount.  
 
Also, depends on whether you intend to keep the HDB or sell off?  Have different impact since there's a ABSD on 2nd property onwards starting from 7%.  Also, depend on the type of private property you are buying, EC or private condo?

BBTW, just go to any of the current property showrooms.  They will assign a property agent to you.  Act like you really interested in buying and they will walk you through everything, including getting a banker to work out how much you can borrow.
 
No need to consult FC lah... Those are for exotics products, land banking, insurance products, ETFs and so on.

I don't need advice in terms of financing, loans, or insurance products. What I'm looking for is more general advice like whether I should even be buying property, or saving more for retirement, or what type of property I should buy (99 LH vs FH, private vs higher end HDB). 
 
Because I am already 41 yrs old, single income family supporting two children. The property calculators at PropertyGuru only tell me maximum affordability based on max borrowing TDSR, Not really helpful. Even if I take a conservative ratio of 30% of my monthly salary, is that worth the risk or better to just save for retirement?

Lol. Ok this is quite a loaded topic here in MCF, if you're talking abt property investment.
 
I think just read and make up your own mind.

On the one hand, I'd like to save for retirement for me and my wife since we are 40 years old already. It's a good situation to be debt free so I can concentrate on just saving. 
 
On the other hand, my current 4-rm flat is a corridor unit and neighbours can be noisy. I wish for more privacy, a bigger flat and better neighbours. If strictly looking at affordability calculators in Property Guru I can afford up to 2.9M property, but that's borrowing at maximum TDSR. 
 
99 yr LH condos at 1500 sqft are more affordable, but are they worth buying for long term stay? Should I consider larger HDB flats instead? 

 
How to answer this kind of deep questions?  
 
Only yourself can answer and decide.  If noisy corridor and don't want excessive debt.  Sell HDB and upgrade to 5 rooms or Executive Maisonette/Flats, more privacy.  But are you prepare to move out of your existing estate and its location, advantages and disadvantages?
 
Taking on debt for a private condo is to achieve what purpose?  Show off?  Get a good location and address?  Private facilities like pools and so on?  Willing to pay the monthly conservancy charges that increases every year?  In my case, I move to condo because of travelling convenience and need to show off to friends and relative that I have "made it".   
 
Anyway, if you approach a FC, they only interested in pushing things to you that they can earn money on... so talking to them guarantee that you will not be talking about property and it's viability at all.

If you don't like living in a corridor unit, by all means upgrade. 
I mean u maybe staying in this unit for another 40 years leh.
Haha
 
Retirement savings, maybe u can read more on CPF website or moneysense to get a better gauge.
I'm sure there are some retirement calculators, that u can use to calculate how much u need in cash/cash equivalent by your retirement age.

If I am u, I wouldn't buy a private property even if I can afford it 
 
It is better to upgrade to a bigger BTO or HDB, and enjoy the bigger space without having to slog to pay off a big loan 
 
The bank will be most willing to offer a big loan, just approach a banker, they will calculate and tell you how much loan you can take to purchase a new property, it's probably more than u can imagine 
 
Single income is risky business, times are bad, touch wood if u kanna retrench, the bank wouldn't allow u to delay payment 
 
With 2 children, if I am in your shoes, I would be extra prudent not to get myself into debts

Then you must ask yourself... why are you asking these questions of someone else who does not understand your circumstances and probably have some incentives or ulterior motives of their own in any advice that they give you?  What outcome you want from the discussions?
 
Here's some general questions that you can ask yourself and review the answers yourself.
1. Current savings.and assets, do not count in the HDB that you are staying in.  Unless you want to squat in the streets?
2. Liabilities.
3. Possible changes in income and assign probabilities to those events
4. Possible changes in liabilities (example, single child support sick elderly parents) and assign probabilities to those events.
5. When you want to retire?  If ever?
6. How much is your current expenditure annually?
7. Do you anticipate major changes to your expenditures?  
8. Is your current expenditure pattern stable and steady ie when you retire, your spending pattern will still be approximately similar?
9. How old does your immediate families live to?  Expected life expectancy fr males is 85 currently.
10. For every 10 years, double your expenditure, that will allow you o arrive at the sum of money that you need to maintain your current lifestyle.  Eg, your expenditure is 12K/yr, by 2056, you will need 48/yr.
11. If that is not achievable, what can be changed in your expenditures in the future.
12. Do you intend to leave any estate to your heirs?
13. How much more eggnest can you build up between now and retirement?
14. Are you prepare to draw down on the egg nest?
15. Do you have any assets that appreciates at the same rate as inflation?
16. Do you intend to depend on your heirs for your future care and housing needs?
 
Anyway, in general, if your intention is to upgrade your property and do not/cannot hold another property, then your property cannot be treated as an asset as you will need a place to stay in even when old.
 
The other alternative is to buy a private property to move into (for the considerations you mention) and rent out your HDB flat as a source of income.  But hey, we know how some bros feel about that   
Also you need to consider the 7% ABSD for a second piece of property and whatever HDB housing rules that are in force for owning private condo and HDB flat at the same time.
 
Also, only you know much valuable is your existing flat in the rental market. 
 
Oh yeah, lot's of also... you need to consider property taxes for every piece of property you own.  4% of annual for the one you squatting in, 10% annual value for the ones rented out.  Also, rental income is chargeable as part of personal income tax.

My flat can get about $700k since its in a good location. I don't intend to keep it for rental income. At my current income level, I just barely squeak under the income ceiling for ECs. Maybe can consider those.

Ok if you say your current hdb is paid, your car loan paid, then for now you have very little debts apart from monthly credit card spending right?
 
41 years old with at least a good further 15-20 years of income age left.. my advice is.. when your HDB completes it MOP.. put it up for rent. Use some savings and put them as downpayment + more to reduce loan for a condo unit. Live in the unit and use the rental income to service the condo unit repayment. 
 
Housing market is slow now but 5-8 years down the road it will pick up.. its only a cycle.

Sorry what do you mean HDB complete MOP? At present I don't have much cash to afford condo down payment. Will need to sell the HDB for the cash.

Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) = 5 years from the date u started living in the flat. Once it completes 5 years you can rent it, sell it do whatever you want.
 
if you arent interested to get rental income.. then can look into ECs but not sure whether u can keep ur HDB unit and also the EC. 
 
Can consider to just keep on saving then.. once your children grow up they'll find their way and you have one nest egg (the hdb) for retirement.

This is my personal take on your circumstances... so take it as you will...
 
Probably you will see it very differently.
 
Given that you share that your current flat can sell for $700K, it must be in one of the mature HDB estate with good infrastructure and such.  Assuming you work downtown, travelling time on public transport is probably between 15 ~ 45 minutes. 
 
I really don't know very much about ECs since they are not on my selections list, but my impression is that most of the new ones are all in the far reaches of Singapore.  So, your kids, wife and yourself are going to undergo a wenching dislocation and major change in lifestyle.  Everything is much farther.
 
Of course, provide that you are looking at new launches and not existing/EC converted condos.
 
Assuming you intend to utilize the max value in your flat to convert to EC, you still have to take a load of 1/2 million.  At current interest rates, equates to about 2.5K - 2.8K monthly for interest and repayment.  
 
If me, i rather stay closer to the city in a HDB flat than to move out far far away.  And the savings from not having to pay off loan is substantial enough to be re-invested into assets for retirement.

I'm of the same view as you and my wife is not keen to move at all. Hence the difficult decision whether to stay in my corridor unit HDB or look for a reasonably priced condo in a mature estate. Or move to a 5 rm or EM HDB in a mature estate.

Pretty much. I have assets locked up in stock market, also been paying off my housing loan. Expenses are reasonably high, I have a special needs child and we also like to go holiday.  
My income level is not too bad, but only in recent years after switching jobs. Last time was not that great.

My thoughts are to calculate backward from retirement age and you might find some answers.

Don't know how to help you leh.  You must run through the list I have previously given you.  And then you prioritize what's valuable to you.
 
Also, I think it's pretty clear that your wife is not pleased about staying far away from city.  That already eliminate a lot of choices.  Ie, reduce list of properties down to city-fringe only.
 
Then get a property agent to walk you thru the selections of old condos or new launches that maybe be available.  Reviewing the listing prices will help you understand whether you still want to go ahead   Also, engage a HDG housing agent to run your through the HDB units available in the estate of interest.  Again that will help you understand the market and focus.
 
Overall, this will be a long process, anything from 1/2 year to 1 year.  So you can wait for the market to settle some more. Prices are unlikely to jump suddenly anytime soon in 2016.  So you got time to think thru and make a decision.

If u don't mind and confident that u can work till 60 yrs old u can look at the possibility of having more loan.
 
If u prefer those relax chill chill lifestyle then don't give yourself more commitment.

What's the ceiling for ec? 12k? The bank is willing to lend you 2.9m even though your are already 41 and can only work another 20 plus yes?

you could probably be granted a loan of about 800k by bank if credit rating is fine
 
corridor unit in HDB unit is not ideal, I have lived in one before and I can understand the cons
 
buy a corner resale unit in a mature estate would probably be around 600k, u still can profit 100K and live very comfortably
 
u need to factor in a monthly increase in expenditure if you want to upgrade to condo, management fees etc.

Actually quite sad, older ones if laid off, indeed very hard to find jobs

Financial planning advice?
 
1. Car price < a third of annual income
2. Residence < 7 x annual income
3. Watch < monthly income
4. Save / Invest > 30% monthly income
5. Full cash anything below $100k else dont buy
6. Keep things simple

You are 41, debt free with little cash, you should aim for full financial freedom in next 5-10 years. Upgrading and adding more debt for consumption at this point in your life is probably not a wise thing to do.  Just my view, it is your life and there is no right and wrong to it.  I just don't buy too much of the "drop dead tomorrow" argument.  The odds are against you.  Lol.
 
Most people in Singapore, after years of asset enhancement brainwashing campaign seem to think the roof over their head will bail them out one day with some extra pocket money, so they keep upgrading (1 property) and becoming a slave to the system.  
 
I rather stay in HDB and have lots of cashflows every month that I can spend or invest to grow the pie.

Yalor.... My Bil kena retrenched few mths back, early 40+ only and yet to get a job....
 
Im quite in the same setup as ts, single income, 2 young kids, fully paid up 4rm hdb, fully paid up 9yrs old car and zero debt so far...
 
I did asked before a few mths back, but more like getting a new bto, role out some money from cpf but still debt free condition even after upgraded from 4rm to 5rm new bto..
 
Then recently I applied for the bidadari 5rm but couldn't get a number ... So, aiming for Feb bidadari bto, if still cannot get, I will revert back to aiming for punggol/sengkak 5rm bto..
 
This year definitely will change new car since into last year but bidadari bto $10 bid is like lucky draw.. Hehe, can get I buy, cannot get I wait for other good option..no rush... Who knows maybe down the road, I might get a private but definitely not now with my current debt appetite..

You have adapt your lifestyle to your finances.
But some people adapt their finances to suit their lifestyle by using loads of debt
 
Credit cards must be paid on time, no other way.
Never roll over.  If you have to roll over it only mean you are f**ked already.
Secondly, savings must tide you over at least a year of mortgage.
 
For cars, do not take an excessive loan which puts you in a situation of negative equity even if you sell it.
For food, manage your spending and watch the fine dining or drinking.  
 
By mid thrities, you should have settled down on a certain lifestyle which is decent and more oless quite fixed.  Base on that lifestyle, we continue to adapt according to earning power, income and savings.
 
ask yourself today, how much you would like to retire with, per month.
Be realistic on your earning power and future desired lifestyle 
and you will know how much longer youneed to work and save / investing starting today.

Actually in property, location is the most important.
 
For HDB in matured estate, you will find the private condo with same number of rooms might not be bigger in terms or usable space.
 
If really just sianz of current living area and want something new, can consider getting interior design and help revamp your inside until it look like 5 star hotel. More bang for buck I feel.

I think what he fed up is is that neighbour smoke outside the window of his corridor unit and maybe look into his unit. No privacy and disruptive.
 
This kind of issue can solve by ID wan. I know someone with same issue. ID had suggested building a feature wall to cover the windows. No change to external façade so all allowed.

Since we are going down the ID route, I think there may be a better solution.  Ask ID to re-design flat with the corridor window blocked off.  Then get a 65 inch TV to replace corridor window and a nice car cam mount at the boarding.  Voila, Perfect view of outside world but no one can see inside.  Insie can turn in hotel deco and completely air-conditioned for comfort.

Your debt appetite is worse than mine but most in their 40s should be wary of too much leverage in this environment.

Older car do not make financial sense in a falling COE environment. I think car depreciation per year is more relevant than the total quantum.

My humble contribution:
 
1) buy the cheapest car u can tahan;
2) buy the biggest house you can afford. Maximum leverage to get that house; 
3) work hard - be an expert in your industry
4) buy maximum insurances to cover everything;
5) yearly medical screening;
6) keep your BMI below 22;
7) don't smoke and drink;
8) eat moderately, no junks in; and most importantly
9) be nice to your loved ones.
 
That's all! I share the same advices with my children. Thanks for reading :)

Good advice bro!
No. 6 keeping BMI below 22 is difficult as u age. 
No. 2 maximize leverage on biggest house possible, this one I personally don't quite agree cos I don't like leveraging n I'm not a firm believer of property always increasing n with rising interest rates means it's a risky move but then again I'm no expert n don't always get it right in property, so who knows!

No problem bro! Ya it's good to be prudent, although from my perspective it's more for own stay rather than investment (within each means of course) :) like big big houses haha :)

I know there are a lot of financial planners out there, but they are all selling something. I just want to seek some advice for people in my situation, what is the best way to proceed.  I currently have no liabilities (housing and car loan paid off), but staying in 4-room HDB. Wish to upgrade to private property, but I'm also concerned about risk since I am a single income family.
 
I'm not seeking advice on investments, but rather how much property I can afford based on my income level, net worth, and age.
Single income..  Can I be so rude to ask.  Is your monthly income at least 5 digit? Like more than 12k at least?  If it's less,  forget to be even thinking about upgrading to private. To be manageable,   should be at the very least 15k per month. But I know those damn rich throttle and etc will laugh at me.  Try your hand at bto as it allows for household income of 12k or less to apply?  
If you are able to afford a private without selling off your current hdb flat,  then I feel 10k per month should be okay.  As you can subsidise with monthly rental.  
 
A decent 3 bedder mass market condo costs around $1.3 mil.  This means 65k cash for 5% upfront deposit, remaining 15% of $195k payable by cash or cpf.  But you MUST have the BRS of at least $80,000 before u can utilise any for your remaining 15%.
 
If u can't afford to buy without first selling your hdb flat,  I would advise u not to.  You never know when restructuring or retrenchment is coming.

I think i m more conservative than u
 
Earn more than 15k single income with 2 kids may not be enough to upgrade to private, think more than 20k is a more comfy range

Typed wrongly,  the word is not comfortable,  but manageable.  
15k only comfortable if they have a hdb house for rental which gives them say $2.5k rental per month. At least this would ease their worries on paying housing loan should the sole breadwinner loses his high pay job.

40s is considered young or old? Old liao...  For housing loan,  it cannot stretch till beyond 30 years of 65 years old whichever comes first..  But i can't imagine paying for my property even in my 60s.  
My current humble 5 room hdb in mature estate,  I will finish paying in another 15 years and I consider myself old liao as I am over 30 years old.
 
Got people ask,  will u upgrade and etc.. My only answer to them,  where on earth I can find a property that can reach a mature mrt station within 5 minutes,  in the way still got cc,  ntuc and etc..  And I have a wet market,  4 coffee shops and etc within 100m. I no money sia. This is my retirement home.

If you are able to afford a private without selling off your current hdb flat,  then I feel 10k per month should be okay.  As you can subsidise with monthly rental.  
 
A decent 3 bedder mass market condo costs around $1.3 mil.  This means 65k cash for 5% upfront deposit, remaining 15% of $195k payable by cash or cpf.  But you MUST have the BRS of at least $80,000 before u can utilise any for your remaining 15%.
 
If u can't afford to buy without first selling your hdb flat,  I would advise u not to.  You never know when restructuring or retrenchment is coming.

Laugh at you for what?
 
You are giving sound advice

Wow the way you all say
 
If wanna live in private property, must earn >20k per month by 35 years old.  Any later, just resign to peasant life until Radx comes collecting
 
I wonder how many living in condos now fit this description.   All high flying careers or maybe they just have rich parents

Old liao...  For housing loan,  it cannot stretch till beyond 30 years of 65 years old whichever comes first..  But i can't imagine paying for my property even in my 60s. 
 
My current humble 5 room hdb in mature estate,  I will finish paying in another 15 years and I consider myself old liao as I am over 30 years old.
 
Got people ask,  will u upgrade and etc.. My only answer to them,  where on earth I can find a property that can reach a mature mrt station within 5 minutes,  in the way still got cc,  ntuc and etc..  And I have a wet market,  4 coffee shops and etc within 100m. I no money sia. This is my retirement home.

We all know, but to follow such theory may b impossible for avg joe Like me. Anyway, there no fix rule as long as u dont sacrifice ur liquidity while owning the car or any big ticket item.
 
 
Totally agree with you.
 
My comment was just meant to point out that you are not really reducing your car costs by buying old car vs new car. And in fact you might actually be spending more on cars overall if you buy old car vs new car in current environment.

Actually financial planning advice have no such thing as one size fits all.
 
It all depends on the individual and what kind of lifestyle one wants to lead vs one's income.
 
Some people like to spread out consumption evenly throughout their life.
 
Others like to consume more younger and less when they are older, and,
 
Some others like to consume less younger and then consume more older.
 
Then, there are those who don't want ton consume throughout their lives and pass on for the next generation to consume.
 
All a matter of preferences and lifestyle. No two individual are the same. What is most important is that you are acting consistently with what you hope to achieve.

That is why the worst vice is often advice. 
 
You know your own body, own income, own projections.
 
Do the homework and plan accordingly for best,  worst and average scenarios. 
 
Advice are good reference points but cannot be followed blindly. 
 

Totally agree with you.

If still young, surely you want to buy your first HDB. It's a sure win for Singaporeans, the earlier the better.
 
Like many others mentioned, there's no one size fits all. Should you invest in property at your current income level ? How about your future income level ? Say you make $1M this year, next year you cannot even make $100k, then how ? Some people make $40k this year, and then over the next 10 years, make $4M. Only you know what you want to do with your life, and what you can achieve.
