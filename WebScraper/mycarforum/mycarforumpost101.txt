Hi Chaps,
 
I am interested to know more property investment members on the forum and discuss about your your property investment approaches, how you manage your property etc. Just a sharing thread where everyone can tap on each others experiences/know how. Feel free to chip in or even if you are not vested but want to find out more.
 
I am currently vested in residential and industrial properties, I will kick off with the below.
 
What I look for in no particular priorities
- Focus mainly on districts 3, 5, 10, 11 
- Areas with upcoming MRT stations
- Old properties with unused plot ratio
- Areas near schools or business parks.
 
Issues faced till date
- Termites
- Air Con breakdowns
- Stuff stolen on property belonging to tenants
- Bad maintenance by the tenant
 
Keen to find out more about
- Retail Property investment
- Overseas investments
- Property Auctions
- Medical Suites
- Districts you believe with upcoming potential

Haha no lah, I first started before the property market went nova, I also had to borrow part of the down payment from my folks to finance the residential properties.
 
The industrial was more a luck and timing co-incidence where I invested with some friends as one knew a company that wanted to rent floor space. That was when the industrial sector was going for about 250 psf.
 
I also investing in my children's lives, but childcare super exp in Singapore, need more passive income to make up

I would need a larger price move 20 - 30% to be swayed to go in, rental yield is typically 2.5 - 3.5%, 5% drop won't be too bad, not to the stamp duty, lawyer fee etc that has to be factored in

I just learnt an important lesson on what not to write in a rental contract. Going to try talk to my tenant on it, will update more after its done.

if you are waiting for a 20-30% drop, then you better be prepared to pay a huge sum in cash.
 
in a tumbling market, the last thing the bank wants to do is finance an asset that may have a chance of going underwater.
 
besides ... if the market comes down that much, before you can buy, i can assure you the big boys will cherry pick the best first. after the last huge tumble, most people have become smarter (either hoarding cash to wait for another tumble or simply not buying risky investments like stock market etc).

Then wait until really drop 20~30% then think abt it... 人的本性是贪.... take 20yrs to drop 20% wld you buy? vs drop 20% in 6mths? vs drop 20% in 1yr+?? 
 
mindset completely diff in all 3 scenarios... 
 
btw... REAL rental income is really pathetic now...(unless u don't pay tax)..... tho still much better than leaving cash in bank

Yes, in life, many people make money not becos they are smart, but becos they have natural timing.
Now for those in their twenties, the timing is really not to great for properties.  
 
No choice gotta move on.
 
Next time our children will have more loans than this generation and higher spending.
We are moving in the same way other developed nations have moved.
Give it another 20-30yrs, Singapore will not be resilient enough to tahan a full blown economic crisis becos we have nothing except borrowed wealth.
 
Anyway who cares, property will always go up , huat ah!!

Yep, agreed. I think 30% - 40% down payment least to finance the property during the downtown to get adequate financing.
 
The properties I look for are generally on a lower cost compared to the surrounding ones, the last property I acquired the agent even warned me that it was pretty run down before we viewed so hold the expectations. Bank valuation was also pretty modest so financing wasn't too bad. Plus it was 300 M from the MRT station 10 mins walk to Mapletree Business City and tenanted so all around decent deal.
 
The pie is big enough for everyone to dig in, I reckon the big boys will probably go for the larger premium slices and hopefully I can get some decent slices after.

I usually have a target price in mind when I see a property, for example the one I was interested in a development where the 3 bedder was going for 1.4M, but realistically to me its only worth between 1.15 - 1.2M, the price would probably be worth 1.4M once the MRT station 100 meters away is completed in 2017. Also taking the rental yield into play at 1.4M it only works out to be 2.5%, I will offer what I am willing to pay and the owner has to decide accordingly.
 
Doesn't have to be 20-30% drop lah, but the asking at the moment just carry to much premium.
 
 

 
Then wait until really drop 20~30% then think abt it... 人的本性是贪.... take 20yrs to drop 20% wld you buy? vs drop 20% in 6mths? vs drop 20% in 1yr+??

property investment to me has reach a high point as in the not many can afford already. so are we still going to expect it to go up further? luckily i have board the boat much earlier but i think the boat is too full now for newcomers to take the risk.
 
look at the price of EC for an example, does it make sense for a couple earning 12k per month to buy it?
 
anyway that's just my view, i may be wrong but i will play safe, the risk is too high now for the return that you are going to expect from it. i'll always look at the risk side first before looking at the gain. if i'm not wrong, it's ok, i just miss an opportunity out of so many others but if i'm right, heng ah. i rather be hum chee for now. good luck.

Agreed with that, prices seem to be unrealistic against the income earned. But low interest rates help to bubble up the prices.
 
I still on waiting on the fence until the market prices have moved down, might take a while since it probably will only happen when interest rates rise. (2016/2017?)
 
I see all these mega condo's >1000 units being built around my area, almost completed to TOP. I really do wonder who is going to rent the investor units which I estimate at about 500 or so. Not to mention the smaller condo 200 - 300 units built which are going to TOP around the same time.

There is a lot of brand new bare vacant units out there. Fitting up cost is too high for a new tenant to come onboard.
 
Something is cooking in Sungei Kadut. I believe it's going to be labelled as the 2nd Jurong Heavy Industrial when the existing lease runs out in 10yrs time. Being near to Causeway, easily get workers from Malaysia.

Read that Pulau Ubin already government acquired  Pulau Semakau not allowed investment yet (to be left barren). 

Agreed with that, prices seem to be unrealistic against the income earned. But low interest rates help to bubble up the prices.

Not too bad, still got price. Some places priceless since the government acquired and left barren.

Actually I meant that as a jest :)
 
I have B1 industrials and it did take a long time to find a tenant, 6 months or so. And you're right the fitting cost is quite high, those with elabote fittings generally would have bought the place. My tenant kept it simple, just Air Con, Desk, some plumbing and shelving / carpteting. Bare basics. Luckily my units have toilets so the tenant pool is slightly wider and can cater to companies that need both storage and admin related.
 
Sungei Kadut very popular industrial area, but its heavy industrial not too familiar with that area. Won't be surprised if JTC or some large co-operation steps in on that party. I will search for information in that area though.
 
No point going into Industrial now anyway, last time the yield was good 6% which made up for the risk. Now its like 3 -4% which puts it almost like residential. Another bubbly sector.

Most of the bare units are doing 5% and location are bad.
 
With a proper fitted unit at a good location, can easily achieve more than 10%
Tenants don't need to spend money fitting up, so landlord can call for higher price.

so if u amortize the fit out costs over the rental period, how much is the yield net of mthly maintenance costs?

Hi,
 
Thanks for your input, I am interested to know which areas your industrial are located if you don't mind sharing. Also what is your tenant pool like? Are you your industrial B1 or B2? Ramp up unit? Will be interested to know more. Thanks.
 
Generally I don't outfit the unit as tenant preferences differ, some want for storage only which means no need carpeting and others want part office which need AC etc. What general outfitting do you do to attract your tenants? 
 
 
There is a business model I know which pulls in 8 - 12% ROI, but this uses a grey area of the law where the unit is outfitted in a office style workplace and the owner then rents out the various cubicles to individuals / small companies. Not keen to go down this path as its quite time consuming. Also I saw URA yank a similar outfit during a crackdown. That said the penalty I believe is not high and if one has time and energy its worth the risk?
 
This is an example of one company I googled
http://officelot.com.sg/gallery.html

but when it comes to job, coe, mrt, etc ... they don't love FT ... muahahaha
very contradicting right
 

if need to stay near parents , then price or place no problem as it is a home , for homes , don't "trade" in them.
 
As for properties , given a choice , i would rather rent the hdb out and buy a private using the rental amount.

if you are waiting for a 20-30% drop, then you better be prepared to pay a huge sum in cash.
 
in a tumbling market, the last thing the bank wants to do is finance an asset that may have a chance of going underwater.
 
besides ... if the market comes down that much, before you can buy, i can assure you the big boys will cherry pick the best first. after the last huge tumble, most people have become smarter (either hoarding cash to wait for another tumble or simply not buying risky investments like stock market etc).

The prime area already drop more than 20%, what are you waiting for ?

The more you shouldnt be trading your existing one. One wrong move , makes your life so much more difficult.
 
I cite an real life example :
 
A buys 3 room back in 2004, got emblocked and sold his flat during 2012 thinking he made some  , he bought a condo with a 1mil loan.
 
Took the rest of the money to "reno" and personal pleasure bring kids for tours and excessive spending thinking he can make another round from easy money.
 
End up , lost his job , unable to service his loans , now having plenty of problems and contemplating suicide. Luckily people step in ask for help , now in the midst of debt settlement and going back on path.
 
Just hope , those who are thinking they can "trade" their homes , be aware of what is to come and what is the worst case scenario. Never expect windfall all the time.

Warren Buffet says, Buy when the market is fearful and no one dares to buy, sell when everyone else says buy.

Well said and good example quoted.
 
In short, there's no free lunch; property like any other investment has its risks and not sure up one.
Admittedly, it doesn't seem like it over the last few years but trust me, I've seen property price go down eg late 80s during the Thai Baht crisis. So good advice to tread with caution and not assumption

Cannot anyhow do renovation without MCST approval, one of the benefits of staying landed is can expand the built up (discretely) without people making noise. Plus side is you get loads of facilities?

I dont think cluster housing will have loads of facilities. The usuals are swimming pool, gym, barbecue and playground plus security. Some only have swimming pool and security. So far the only cluster project I know that have plenty of facilities is Estevilla. Based on facilities alone, can consider not bad when compare with other cluster housing.

Notes
1 The property is jointly owned by husband and wife, but then taxed separately (50% upon each partner). Exchange rate used: US$1 = AUD1.674277.
2 Estimated values only. The following may be deducted: capital works deduction, real estate agent fee, body corporate charges (land tax, council rates and water charges), landlord’s insurance, repairs and maintenance.
 
 
The above is an example based on non-resident tax rate for 2006, look at the link below for the current non-resident tax rate.

Do you think Australia more upside or Asia countries like Philippines Makati, Vietnam, Cambodia? As in 1 Australia property can get you maybe 5 or more of the same size in the Asian countries.

I would say the emerging market economies would definitely be a better bet, I would likely put my money in Jakarta property which I hear nets 7% ROI for rental in decent areas (barring the usual leasehold for foreigners etc).
 
For Australia I'm getting ROI is about 3.8% which is not enough to cover the mortgage (if there was) as the interest runs about 5 - 7%. The property I'm dealing is a simple suburbia type which was passed down by a late relative in the Perth suburbs so its easier to rent out to locals . I think the dynamics of the property market in cities like Sydney would be a lot more appealing for an investor but not familiar with that, but Australia property market is generally quite stable and on the rise from influx of investors.
 
If one has spare cash buying land in sea facing areas might be a better bet, the coastal side has seen more houses being built and prices have gone up a fair bit.
