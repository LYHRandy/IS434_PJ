Every few years, up value for foreign buyers allowed to buy their private housing. Last time housing from RM$250k & above till now almost RM1 million .... 
 
And when you re-sell to their locals, cannot sell at the value you buy, so must sell to another foreigner and if I am the foreigner, why should I buy a second hand one which I could get a brand new one at the same price...

Don't get me wrong. I don't feel that the responsible/level-headed majority should be dragged down by the crazy/deluded/foolish minority.
 
It's OK to release CPF early to everyone *provided* the gahmen adopts a strict "you no money because you spent it all = you die" attitude. Strictly no social support for these losers. Genuine hardship cases (i.e. not because of foolish profligacy on the individual's part) can be considered on a specific basis.
 
If they did that, they would have my full support. Why burden the rest of us to support the stupid fringe of society?
 
Of course, a lot of the same bleeding heart liberals that are now crying out for "our CPF" will turn to crying out for "the plight of the pathetic poor". At that point, I will be rather in favour of getting them all summarily executed (the bleeding hearts, that is).
 
Unfortunately, the gahmen realises that the latter outcome would be even more politically unfavourable than the current policy, so they're maintaining status quo.

For many of us we understand and realised a scam in most of the time. But we must also realised that some insurance products (especially investment link insurance products) sometime give project returns close to 20% but we know it is just projection and cannot be achieved in most times.
 
Furthermore, there are Forex dealers and "gurus" advertising that they make so much money in a few days and gain 1000%. As a layman, I assumed that if a nation newspaper that also vet advertisement in accordance with the regulars such claims must be true.
 
In the bank, we use to see frontline staff selling funds claiming and showing funds gain over 20% in a year.
 
So if I were a lay person, 20% is not hard to achieve and is in fact conservative. In addition, these sellers are really convincing at what they do.
 
I believe this is the most common reason why people get caught.

For many of us we understand and realised a scam in most of the time. But we must also realised that some insurance products (especially investment link insurance products) sometime give project returns close to 20% but we know it is just projection and cannot be achieved in most times.
 
Furthermore, there are Forex dealers and "gurus" advertising that they make so much money in a few days and gain 1000%. As a layman, I assumed that if a nation newspaper that also vet advertisement in accordance with the regulars such claims must be true.
 
In the bank, we use to see frontline staff selling funds claiming and showing funds gain over 20% in a year.
 
So if I were a lay person, 20% is not hard to achieve and is in fact conservative. In addition, these sellers are really convincing at what they do.
 
I believe this is the most common reason why people get caught.

 
equally bad are those latest CFD/ FX trading sites.. so easy to move $ there & even easier to lose all of it. those sites make sound that anyone can become a wall st trader overnight n making tons... reality is far from that & im sure lots of retirees have lost $ punting on CFDs & FX.

GIC acquires stake in Brazilian education firm
5 Aug 2014 

 
The firm is a leading player in Brazil’s K-12 education market, the sovereign wealth fund said.
 
SINGAPORE: GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, announced on Friday (Aug 15) that it has acquired an 18.5 per cent equity stake in Brazilian education company Abril Educação.
 
The Brazil-listed firm is a leading player in the country’s K-12 education market, and has a diversified portfolio of products and services, including learning systems, textbooks, prep courses and language schools, GIC said in a statement.
 
“The investment stems from GIC's belief in the growth potential of the K-12 education market in Brazil, as well as Abril's unique multi-segment positioning with a focus on quality, renowned brands and robust operational capability,” it added.

Easy. Probably, there's a referral scheme as well.
 
1,500 pax. You complain and ask gahment to step in and regulate, they will tell you say 1,500 pax is only 0.03% of our population affected niah. 
 
These types of investments........ the pattern is the same although the products could be different. You name it..... Ostrich farm, gold mine, lobster farms, etc........
 
Hand over $$$ very fast, get back $$$ = impossible.
 
 

 
A colleague of mine ask me to buy shares in this Virgin Gold Mining Corporation few years back. Luckily never listened to him. A few colleagues who invested cannot get their funds back, only a paltry so-call "return" for the first few months after that cannot login to the system to withdraw their "return"... lol
 
If want to invest, must really do research and understand the background, products, demand of the company. That's what I feel.

 	TITLE: Brazil denies links with property firm EcoHouseBy Tan Weizhen
POSTED: 15 Aug 2014 07:09
URL: http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/brazil-denies-links-with/1313584.html
 
Up to 1,500 investors in Singapore have reportedly poured S$70 million into projects linked to the UK-based company.

SINGAPORE: Hundreds of investors here, who ploughed millions of dollars into the hands of a developer claiming to be working with the Brazilian government on a social housing programme, were left fearing the worst after the Brazilian Embassy said on Thursday (Aug 14) that its government had no dealings with the company.
In fact, it was not even aware until recently, when complaints from Singapore investors mounted, that the United Kingdom-based company operated in Brazil.
EcoHouse, which has abruptly shut down its Suntec offices, is neither affiliated with the Brazilian national housing programme nor registered as a partner of its state-owned bank.
“In view of allegations by Singapore investors regarding EcoHouse Group, a company linked to executives in the UK, the Embassy of Brazil would like to state that the Embassy had no prior knowledge of the existence of EcoHouse’s operations in Brazil,” the embassy said in response to TODAY’s queries.
Some of the investors had approached the embassy. After contacting several agencies within the Brazilian government, the embassy found that there was “no record of any agreement with any company bearing the name ‘EcoHouse’ related to ‘Minha Casa, Minha Vida’ (Brazil’s national housing programme), or any other federal programme”.
The embassy added that “Bosque Residencial” in Natal, State of Rio Grande do Norte – one of the housing developments offered by EcoHouse for investment – is not listed in the records of Brazil’s state-owned bank, Caixa Economica Federal.
COMPANY ON MAS' ALERT LIST
On its website, EcoHouse claims that it was chosen by the Brazilian government as “the only UK company to date officially authorised to build developments under Minha Casa, Minha Vida”, which aims to provide three million homes for the country’s growing middle class.
The company was founded in 2009 by Mr Anthony Armstrong Emery. Various media reports have put the number of Singapore investors in EcoHouse projects at between 800 and 1,500. Up to S$70 million had reportedly been ploughed into three housing projects.
Some investors have begun legal action against EcoHouse to recover their capital investments, which amounted to a minimum of £23,000 (S$47,810) per unit.
EcoHouse had promised a 20 per cent fixed rate of return for a 12-month investment contract, but many investors said they have not received their returns or their capital despite their contracts reaching maturity.
The company was recently put on the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) Investor Alert List, which lists unregulated companies that may have been wrongly perceived as being licensed or authorised by the MAS.
Reports have been filed against the company with the police and the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD). On whether EcoHouse is under probe, a CAD spokesman would only say: “It is inappropriate to comment on police investigations, if any.”
In response to TODAY’s queries sent on Tuesday, EcoHouse chief operations officer Deen Bissessar said on Thursday that the closure of its offices in Suntec Tower 2 was part of measures to “consolidate into our Brazil operation and managing global affairs from our global headquarters in London”.
He added that “the position remains unchanged” and the company is trying to “improve the situation with regard to construction and payments”.
“We absolutely remain committed to our clients and if that was not the case, we would simply shut all doors – which is something we have no intention of doing,” added Mr Bissessar. The company was unable to respond to queries about the Brazilian Embassy’s comments on Thursday by press time.
The developer’s registered address with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority is in Cecil Street. When TODAY visited the premises, it was occupied by a company called MC Corporate Services.
EMBASSY ADVISES DUE DILIGENCE
For companies regulated by the MAS, investors could seek redress at the Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre. However, such a recourse is not available for EcoHouse investors.
The Brazilian Embassy has urged potential investors considering putting their money in Brazil’s property market to carry out due diligence when they encounter any developers claiming to have projects supported by the Brazilian government.
Consumer watchdog CASE advised consumers to be mindful of the high risk involved when investing in overseas properties.
CASE executive director Seah Seng Choon pointed out that the laws in other countries are different from Singapore’s and investors may not enjoy the same degree of protection. “Seeking redress in the event of dispute can be cumbersome and in most cases consumers are not able to get their money back,” he said.

Can't believe that up to 1500 people in Singapore bought into this.  20% return is too good to be true.  These people can say goodbye to their money...

 
I believe most of these are the middle-class ppl who have enough money to invest and yet lack of investment knowledge.
The really rich ppl would not have invested in these..
 
Bottomline, invest in something you can see, and not something you can't see and touch in so faraway land !
 
Anyway, I really don't think they can get back their hard-earned money liao...
I really hope these ppl can learn their lessons, even though this may a heavy blow, but money can be earned back, and most importantly, don't repeat the mistakes again.

  EcoHouse refutes get rich quick claims 
Jun 10, 2013

 
 
By Andrew Batt:EcoHouse, the developer behind what was Singapore’s most successful property investment in 2012, has reacted strongly to defend claims in a weekend newspaper article which cast doubt on the viability of its business.More than 1,500 Singapore-based investors are among thousands around the world who have invested in the company’s social housing property investment opportunities in Brazil.An article published by Business Times headlined ‘Beware Get Rich Quick Schemes’ questioned whether the EcoHouse investment opportunity is too good to be true. The company, which opened offices at Suntec Tower to serve its Singapore investors earlier this year, has reacted quickly and strongly to the claims.Anthony Armstrong-Emery, Chief Executive Officer of EcoHouse, speaking exclusively to PropertyGuru, said: “Our investor proposition is clearly not too good to be true. We are not in breach of a single client contract in Singapore, or indeed elsewhere.”He added: “This investment is true, and is made possible by some unique determining factors in the niche of social housing in Brazil whereby construction is affordable, build times are fast, profits are strong, demand significantly exceeds supply and therefore investor returns are deliverable.”EcoHouse was not contacted for comment for the original article, and an angry Armstrong-Emery added: “The article implies by saying this that an investment with EcoHouse is risky. Whilst there is risk with any investment we have proved and are proving that the risk is very low with EcoHouse and refute the implication that the EcoHouse investment is very risky. The language overall implies that investors are lured into some sort of trap.”EcoHouse investors were promised returns on 20 percent on their investments without currency risk – something that was also questioned within the article.Armstrong-Emery said: “By including this suggestion in the article they are seeding further doubt in the reader that the investment is legitimate. We refute that there is a significant currency risk, particularly as the money is drawn down quickly as the units are built quickly.”He also welcomed the suggestion that property investors conduct proper due diligence prior to investing.“I agree. This is why I encourage investors to spend time with us in our offices and also to visit Brazil. EcoHouse an open door policy, and one of our core aims is to be as transparent as possible. We openly share bank statements, letters from the government, sales reports, costings and much more, with our investors to establish a level of trust that we believe to be unique.“EcoHouse runs fortnightly events where clients can meet us, and that’s in addition to one-to-one meetings. We also run investor trips to Brazil. The journalist could have asked more about this had they contacted us. We are very transparent and public about our willingness to spend time with the client explaining their investment.”EcoHouse was contacting all of its Singapore-based investors by email this morning, providing them with detailed answers to the allegations and suggestions made in the newspaper article, and also in recent online forums.
Picture caption: More than 1,500 Singapore-based investors have invested in EcoHouse. Earlier this year the company celebrated the opening of its offices at Suntec Tower in Singapore with a series of events.

If you have only $20K to invest, getting 7% PA return is not too tough.
 
If you have $20 million, of course 7% PA is tough.

If 20k can do 7%, why 20mil can't? 
 
I need to go into equities to get more than 5% return.. 20k Simi bond also cannot buy other than SG govt bond.
 
20mil.. just need buy 1 AA- bond that pays 5%, then collateralized for another 70% to buy similar bond.. minus the borrowing cost, nett nett already already 7%.

I quote AA bec lesser chance of margin call and bank willing to give a lending value of easily 70% above. If looking at A or so.. Plenty of company in this region that's offering in AUD or USD.
 
Just need to look beyond SGD.

Seriously there are no so call good deals.. Beauty in eyes of beholder.. What suits one may not sound logical to another.. Best deal is to understand yourself, your own risk threshold and own budget, own holding power, and own investment expectation and horizon.

Bro, this is part and parcel of posting in forums. U r free to air ur views and must be open to criticism. Dun be discouraged and dun feel pressurised or stress unnecessarily. It's easy to be misunderstood so u just have to explain your points and stand corrected. Once u stay long enuff, u will find that this is the most informative and interesting forum, filled with people with high intellectual and with very very good sense of humor plus some level of tikoness. Their sense of humor are at times simpy unbelieveable that can brighten ur otherwise gloomy day. Enjoy!

It's OK to release CPF early to everyone *provided* the gahmen adopts a strict "you no money because you spent it all = you die" attitude. Strictly no social support for these losers. Genuine hardship cases (i.e. not because of foolish profligacy on the individual's part) can be considered on a specific basis.
 
If they did that, they would have my full support.

 
I support too!!! But political suicide.. Like you said, the very idiots clamouring for the CPF to be released will blame the govt when those who got their CPF wasted it away..
 
I notice quite a few of these fly by nite company used suntec office as their temporary base.
 
Their profits must be damn good.. Then again, probably 75% profits or so, minus sales cost (commission to salesman, etc).. Good biz!

Nonsense, property will always go up , even if everything crash and burn.
Iskandar is best place for investment. Sure make money
Worldwide properties confirm make loads of money.
Just close eyes and showhand with your entire wealth.

a lot of people do not remember the many buildings half built in KL, Bangkok, Jakarta late 1990s..  
There is a saying that a really huge crash happens in 13-15 years.. Because the young generations who didn't know what's has happened previously is bullish, and the previous generations who have experienced that have either bankrupted during previous crash or have retired..

But non gamblers who sits at the fence and finally cannot take it that other gamblers are making money.. Will be the ultimate losers.

Agree x10.
 
Why buy some far flunged properties when we have not even visited the place or seen the properties, and do not even have control over the illiquid disposal.
Whoever said such investments are good, please redeem all his local asset and chiong in.

The way I see many people "investing", they are better off going to the casinos and playing black/ red on the roulette table. Save time, less hassle and the casinos throw in a beer or 2. Most important is they only lose what they have on their hands.

At least ABSD is in govt hand  (and an informed decision one can decide to take) and you pay some more property tax and what not other taxes 
 
But in the scams you have to pay good money to chase back bad money, and get back maybe nothing and time and stress and trauma.. yo-yoing up and down ... no calculator can calculate this for you unless the guy is caught and provided he can make amends or has assets

Investors set to lose S$70m
 

Feb 2, 2015
 
 
The collapse of the British arm of Brazilian property developer EcoHouse could see Singaporean investors losing as much as S$50million, and investors worldwide close to S$70million.
 
Speaking to British newspaper The Financial Times, British-based Brazilian lawyer Renata Sa, who is representing 400 Singapore investors as well as other investors from around the world in two class actions, said: “This should be a wake-up call.”
 
It is known that action is being taken against the Brazil arm of the EcoHouse operations, as well as real estate agencies and financial advisors in the United Kingdom who were responsible for handling an Escrow account.
 
EcoHouse sold more than 1,000 individual investments in Singapore and Southeast Asia during 2012 and 2013. The British company was the subject of a creditors’ voluntary liquidation last month, at which PricewaterhouseCoopers was nominated as the liquidating company.
 
The Brazil company is not, as far is known, in liquidation although media reports suggest progress is at a standstill following alleged tax irregularities and a police raid last year. Many Singapore and Asia investors have sales and purchase agreements with the Brazilian company, and not with the U.K. company which is facing liquidation this month.
 
Flamboyant company founder, Anthony Armstrong-Emery, is reported to be in the Middle East attempting to raise additional funds, but time to save the EcoHouse empire, and with it millions of dollars and investment, appears to be fading fast.
 
According to the British newspaper, EcoHouse has blamed the “unexpected intervention” of the Brazilian Police on “malicious, inaccurate and fanciful allegations” by competitors and former landowners. Funds worth more than S$65 million said to be being investigated.
 
British Police are also taking an interest, with an investigation reportedly taking place by the Fraud and Linked Crime Online Team of the Metropolitan Police. It estimated some 200 complaints have been made from the U.K. with a value of some totally S$14 million.
 
EcoHouse was the best-selling single overseas property investment in Singapore during 2012, and with its offices at Suntec Tower, which have since closed, it attracted many small-time and first-time overseas property investors in Southeast Asia with promises of 20 percent returns in 12-months on its S$46,000 social housing property investments. Many investors purchased multiple units while other clubbed together with family and friends to buy a single property.

According to the British newspaper, EcoHouse has blamed the “unexpected intervention” of the Brazilian Police on “malicious, inaccurate and fanciful allegations” by competitors and former landowners. Funds worth more than S$65 million said to be being investigated.
 
British Police are also taking an interest, with an investigation reportedly taking place by the Fraud and Linked Crime Online Team of the Metropolitan Police. It estimated some 200 complaints have been made from the U.K. with a value of some totally S$14 million.
 
EcoHouse was the best-selling single overseas property investment in Singapore during 2012, and with its offices at Suntec Tower, which have since closed, it attracted many small-time and first-time overseas property investors in Southeast Asia with promises of 20 percent returns in 12-months on its S$46,000 social housing property investments. Many investors purchased multiple units while other clubbed together with family and friends to buy a single property.

at least these ppl punt five figure sums, still got 1% hope of seeing some form of return
 
how about those who voluntarily pay six figure sum to IRAS ABSD? That one only goes to nation building
 
not a single cent goes to enhancing your capital value of your house  

 
At least they weren't scammed of their money. It's part of the taxes they have to pay for buying something.
 
Same can be said of COE, but nobody is scammed into paying it, hoping they'd get high returns from the government.

The New Paper


Almost all his savings were wiped out.
This included money for his family, two schoolgoing children and holiday plans.
Mr Kenneth Ng, 43, never imagined himself to be a real estate investor, but after listening to a speaker at a property seminar, he invested almost all of his $80,000 savings.
The supply chain executive, who earns $8,000 a month, bought a "fixer-upper" in the US city of Memphis for US$55,000 (S$74,500).

Personally I would not be comfortable buying foreign property that I have not seen with my own eyes. Hell, even for local property I'd prefer resale to BTO/new launch, at least I know what I'm buying and not just have drawings and fancy models to rely on.
 
Maybe that would hinder my earning ability as an investor and I will not become a multi-millionaire, but at the same time at least I won't kena ketok in all the scams.

The root cause is laziness (no due diligence) and greed (want more the fastest and easiest way).
 
Sometimes when a person is convincing and couple with "ready news in mass media" that some recent stocks have risen 4000plus% since IPO or even something cost to home, like Blumont, someone invested tens of thousand of dollars, literally became millionaire overnight. These "lubricate" the mind that there are such deals to be had in the world.
 
The average person, like me, needs to work very hard for our money, so we need equally sure how we spend our money. We don't want to be a part of the "charity organisation" for the con artist.

Woman suffering from liver failure loses $42,000 after joining investment scheme
Ronald LohThe New PaperWednesday, Jun 17, 2015



She needed $1,000 a month to pay her medical bills following a liver transplant operation two years ago.
Although her two children are working and able to provide for her, Madam Normah Ahmed, 58, did not want to impose on them.
So when a friend told her about a get-rich-quick investment scheme, Madam Normah invested about $42,000 of her savings in a seaweed farm company, Solarwarm, in August last year.
She was promised three times returns in three months and Madam Normah thought she would not have to worry about her finances from then on.
But a few months later, in October, her troubles worsened.
Businessman Simon Ng, 54, to whom she had entrusted her money to invest, kept making excuses for the payment delays.
Several other people who invested with Mr Ng were in the same predicament.
NO RECOVERY
Today, Madam Normah, who lives in a four-room HDB flat in the West, has yet to recover a cent from her investment of $42,000.
The administrative assistant still has "a few thousand" in the bank, but she told The New Paper that life would be tougher without most of her hard-earned money.
Madam Normah had suffered liver failure in 2013 and received a portion of her son's liver in an operation in May that year.
This means she has to receive lifelong medical treatment.
"There are blood tests, medical check-ups and liver transplant medication to be paid for every month," she said.
"I don't know what's going to happen, but it means I have to continue working and saving all over again. I feel so stupid and really regret what I've done."
Help from her children is not an option, she said.
"They have their own families to take care of. I can't be burdening them with my medical bills."
Last Tuesday, she and a group of about 15 other investors chased Mr Ng across Singapore in a bid to recover their money. (See report on right.)
Housewife Bebe Sim, 55, claimed that she invested about $680,000 into four companies following Mr Ng's instructions. A friend had introduced her to him in January last year.
"I was taken in when he said he was helping others. Plus, I've always been doing well with my own stocks and shares so I thought to give it a try.
"He told me he was earning $100,000 a month and said that if I invested money and time into this, my daughter and I would not have to work again," she said.
So between January and July last year, she invested in four companies - Wenyard, Bossventure, Solarwarm and Mega Option.
To fund these investments, she withdrew all her savings, sold her other shares and pawned her jewellery.
She said she did so after Mr Ng had promised her high returns and payouts.
He also flew her on all-expenses paid trips to Malaysia for seminars and to visit the Solarwarm farm.
But even though she received about $40,000 in payouts from Solarwarm, the rest of her $640,000 - excluding the promised profits - has yet to be returned to her.
"My family is now in ruins. We used to be able to lead a comfortable life, but now we have to scrimp and save every day," she said.
Another investor, who wanted only to be known as Mr C. G. Lim, said he gave up a five-figure salary job to focus on Mr Ng's recommended investments.
He went on to invest about $55,000 in the same companies as Madam Sim.
But Mr Lim began to realise he could lose all his money in September last year.
He said he found himself walking listlessly down the streets and he eventually broke down.
"I even brought my wife and her family into this. Today, she brings this up every day.
"I just hope the authorities can look into this and get our money back," he said.
Added Madam Normah: "Now I know there's no such thing as a get-rich-quick scheme. I'll never trust something like this again."
BUSINESSMAN: I AM A VICTIM TOO
They chased him from his Toa Payoh flat to his lawyer's office in Changi.
The angry investors even hired a debt-collection agency, JMS Roger's, to get their money back from businessman Simon Ng, who had been entrusted with their money for investments.
But Mr Ng, 54, told The New Paper in a phone interview on Friday that he, too, was a victim of the failed multi-level marketing scheme.
He claimed that he lost over $100,000 and added that he had introduced only "two to three" people to the scheme and it was they who spread the word to others.
Last Tuesday, Mr Ng, 54, was supposed to meet a group of 15 investors at a coffee shop in Geylang.
When he sent another person to pass on his lawyer's details to them, they flocked to his Toa Payoh flat at about 2pm, reported The Straits Times.
A woman who answered the door told them that Mr Ng was not home before calling the police.
It was only when police officers arrived that he came to the door and complained to them that he was being harassed by debt collectors.
When he tried to leave for his lawyer's office in Changi at about 5pm, investors confronted him in the carpark near his flat. They approached him again outside his lawyer's office two hours later.
Mr Ng added that the money was invested into the various companies and he did not pocket the investors' money.
For now, he said that he has passed the matter to his lawyers.

Woman suffering from liver failure loses $42,000 after joining investment scheme
Ronald LohThe New PaperWednesday, Jun 17, 2015



She needed $1,000 a month to pay her medical bills following a liver transplant operation two years ago.
Although her two children are working and able to provide for her, Madam Normah Ahmed, 58, did not want to impose on them.
So when a friend told her about a get-rich-quick investment scheme, Madam Normah invested about $42,000 of her savings in a seaweed farm company, Solarwarm, in August last year.
She was promised three times returns in three months and Madam Normah thought she would not have to worry about her finances from then on.
But a few months later, in October, her troubles worsened.
Businessman Simon Ng, 54, to whom she had entrusted her money to invest, kept making excuses for the payment delays.
Several other people who invested with Mr Ng were in the same predicament.
NO RECOVERY
Today, Madam Normah, who lives in a four-room HDB flat in the West, has yet to recover a cent from her investment of $42,000.
The administrative assistant still has "a few thousand" in the bank, but she told The New Paper that life would be tougher without most of her hard-earned money.
Madam Normah had suffered liver failure in 2013 and received a portion of her son's liver in an operation in May that year.
This means she has to receive lifelong medical treatment.
"There are blood tests, medical check-ups and liver transplant medication to be paid for every month," she said.
"I don't know what's going to happen, but it means I have to continue working and saving all over again. I feel so stupid and really regret what I've done."
Help from her children is not an option, she said.
"They have their own families to take care of. I can't be burdening them with my medical bills."
Last Tuesday, she and a group of about 15 other investors chased Mr Ng across Singapore in a bid to recover their money. (See report on right.)
Housewife Bebe Sim, 55, claimed that she invested about $680,000 into four companies following Mr Ng's instructions. A friend had introduced her to him in January last year.
"I was taken in when he said he was helping others. Plus, I've always been doing well with my own stocks and shares so I thought to give it a try.
"He told me he was earning $100,000 a month and said that if I invested money and time into this, my daughter and I would not have to work again," she said.
So between January and July last year, she invested in four companies - Wenyard, Bossventure, Solarwarm and Mega Option.
To fund these investments, she withdrew all her savings, sold her other shares and pawned her jewellery.
She said she did so after Mr Ng had promised her high returns and payouts.
He also flew her on all-expenses paid trips to Malaysia for seminars and to visit the Solarwarm farm.
But even though she received about $40,000 in payouts from Solarwarm, the rest of her $640,000 - excluding the promised profits - has yet to be returned to her.
"My family is now in ruins. We used to be able to lead a comfortable life, but now we have to scrimp and save every day," she said.
Another investor, who wanted only to be known as Mr C. G. Lim, said he gave up a five-figure salary job to focus on Mr Ng's recommended investments.
He went on to invest about $55,000 in the same companies as Madam Sim.
But Mr Lim began to realise he could lose all his money in September last year.
He said he found himself walking listlessly down the streets and he eventually broke down.
"I even brought my wife and her family into this. Today, she brings this up every day.
"I just hope the authorities can look into this and get our money back," he said.
Added Madam Normah: "Now I know there's no such thing as a get-rich-quick scheme. I'll never trust something like this again."

Where got free lunch and easy money.. Anyhow buy property for anther country and assept the same as Singapore law and consumer protection. These ppl are just gullblie and clueless about investments.
 
Things to note before even touch overseas investments :
1. Fly there to see for oneself.
2. Learn about gov, regulations and law
3. Land history. (Look for equal to URA for land checking purposes)
4. Exit strategies (How to go about)
5. Taxes and maintaining the asset.
6. What is the norminal property valuation around the country and that piece of property around

Agree x10.
 
Why buy some far flunged properties when we have not even visited the place or seen the properties, and do not even have control over the illiquid disposal.
Whoever said such investments are good, please redeem all his local asset and chiong in. 
 
I will stand aside and watch with pop corns, hide behind the puipui T2 (to shield me against any fragmentations in case of collateral damage). 
 
A fool and his money will part.

 
I like your last sentence.

Mr Lim told Wanbao: "He guaranteed that I would earn profits of more than a million dollars a year if I bought a 3 per cent stake in his company for $50,000."

they're young at 28 and lost 26K .... they learnt their lesson well..... but using or faking HDB logo is definitely cheating right??
Previously some contractors used that ruse to trick people by that method into paying for ceiling cracks ... upgrading or what nots... 
People are becoming more daring nowadays, certainly.
