This thread arises of a discussion initiate in the car/lifestyle section.  However, some very interesting points came up as to how Singapore properties should be considered.  The emphasis is deliberate as the model only works for Singapore.
 
There are a lot of property gurus here, so please ignore this un-sophisticated newbie who is just venturing into property and trying to justify his purchases.
 
Fundamental assumption : Singapore will continue to exist as a nation or if not, a quasi nation with independence and that the calibre of national leadership remain high.
 
Let with with an analogy from Singapore/Malaya history; Rubber planting.
 
As all Singaporean students knows from their history books, rubber tree takes 5 - 7 years to mature.
 
So, any businessman intending to venture into this industry has to
1. Buy the land
2. Clear the land 
3. Plant the cuttings and continue to care for the younglings
 
These are the years where there are negative profits as the businessman has to continue to pour money into his investment with no guarantee on returns (storm blows down estate, commodity prices collapse, disease toll on trees, etc).
 
However, if the plantation make it through and extraction starts, profits will start to flow in and can continue to flow for another 25 years or more.  Also, the rubber estate itself also gain value as it could be sold to buyers with a risk premium for taking on the early year risk.
 
One thing that a number of people keep telling me is rental margins and so on... but they always left me scratching my head, the time horizon they use is very short.
 
Like rubber planting, buying property for me is for the long haul with time horizon of 30 - 40 years or more.  Analogous
1. Buy the property
2. Do interior finishing
3. Continue to care for the property
 
These are the years where profits may be negative (if you cannot find a tenant) as the investors has to pour money into the investment.  
 
However, once the mortgage is paid off, profits will start to flow in and continue to flow as long as you own that property.  That is not in addition to capital appreciation if you sell off the property.  
 
So, the total cost and total profit that can be taken from the property over a time horizon of 30 - 40 years is actually more important then short term rental margins gained while the mortgage is still in force.

Technically you can consider cash in flow as profit only after you've broke even.

Lets just put it this way.   
 
1.  Its not how much you make but how quickly you can make it.
2.  Its not how much you lose but how much more you make over the losses.
 
There is no need to explain yourself unless you are a policy maker whose decisions impact the lives of the masses
 
Bottomline,
Your money 
Your life
Your decision

As one of your critics, I would like to point out that this assumption is harder to hold the longer the period considered;
 
Fundamental assumption : Singapore will continue to exist as a nation or if not, a quasi nation with independence and that the calibre of national leadership remain high.
 
This year we just celebrated SG50. So when you talk in terms of 40 years, it is almost as long as we have been an independent country for.
 
I'm no property guru also, but my naive view is that buying property in a country is essentially taking a bet on the economy of that country. It is a popular investment tool as it is usually one of the most leveraged investments you can make with cheap funding relative to leveraging other assets.
 
For those that think property can only go up in the long term, I would like to post the example of Ireland;

Hmm... I knew these were bound to pop up...  but you still had to do it  
 
1. Your long run is too short...  all properties bubble will pop and show poor results within the selected time period.  
2. Ireland is a big country with the full spectrum of property types and cities can sprawl. 
3. Singapore has finite amount of land.  Not comparable to Ireland.
 
Although we have being an independent country for 50 years, land ownership in Singapore has continuously lasted for almost 200 years.  I know that not comparable to owning an apartment, but unless we get conquered or blown up by another country, it's reasonable to expect land ownership to persist in its current form for another 100 years.
 
There are many rich third generations families quietly living in Singapore whose forefathers acquired land in the early period.  Once in a while, they pop up in the news like the case where the old lady nearly got cheated by ah tiong.
 
Anyway, I am sure that I have chosen the right path.  Nobel prize winning economist has shown that only land ownership can drive a consistent decade through decade return regardless of inflation.

Someone had to do it.  
 
But my point is that with your assumption about the +ve prospects of Singapore, you will almost always come to the conclusion that Singapore property is a good buy. The assumption leads the conclusion.
 
I haven't see the study you spoke about to comment about its relevance here. But the one key thing about property as an investment is that to make a concrete investment, you have to tie yourself to the economics of a particular country and these 2 are strongly correlated.

This one only time can tell and I'm in no position to comment on your investment decisions.
 
Your opinion on how property prices will go in the future is as good as mine. Main thing is that if you have the conviction and have already done the homework, you should go for it. Fortune favours the bold.
 
I only wish to discuss assumptions and logical consistency of the model you put up.

Yep, you are correct about those assumptions.. and I think I have been pretty upfront on them...
 
I choose to believe that Singapore will continue to exist in some form or another in the next 100 years.  Hopefully, we can escape the kind of winnowing that afflict Detroit, Birmingham and so on...  but we are in a pretty special position since the founding of Singapore and we have keep evolving our position vis a vis the world for the last two hundred years.
 
First as a port for spices, then a bunker for steam ship, a manufacturing hub and port for the Malayan hinterlands, and when that went, as a cheap pro-capitalist low-cost manufacturing, then a electronics manufacturing hub, then a financial capital hub and home for the rich of the world.  And even the current government cannot claim credit for all the evolution that this land has went through in 200 years.
 
As an independent nation, we have a lot of say how we want to chart our course and is very responsive to the changing global environment.  With us embedded inside ASEAN and TPF, hopefully we will succeed in jumping to the next point of our evolution.  Maybe we can become Brussel of EU?
 
As I have stated elsewhere, I am not a gambling man, and my logic lead me to a conclusion that property is a very safe bet.  And as you have point out, I am prepare to be tied to this country economics.  Let's explore where my logic fail me, but please, we are looking at time windows of multi-decades, around 20 - 40 years into the future.

I think the pioneer govt got the property game right.  Buy land cheap (forced acquisition), invest in hdb apartments, lease out to owners who pay upfront or max 30 years loan, and make them think it's theirs. Rolling in cash, repeat after 99 years.

Your logic doesn't fail you and what I like about you is that you never fudge on data or assumptions.
 
My discussion is mainly directed on the shortcomings of the model you have presented.
 
I agree with you that Singapore has a lot going for her however that is also not my discussion.
 
My point is that the model you have presented makes an unfair initial assumption that leads the conclusion. And the worst thing of this assumption is that it gets weaker the longer you look into the future which is what your model pertains to look at. Note, I'm not giving any opinion on the assumption itself but just its place relative to the model.
 
To provide an example; I can have a model to project the stock price of any company using say discounted future revenues and cash flows. But if I make the assumption from the start that this company is under good management and will be under good management in the future and will remain a viable concern for the long run, this model will likely come to the conclusion that the company stock is a a buy and hold.
 
My opinion is that your model needs to look one step before the main assumption to be more relevant.

Sorry, you lost me... what initial assumption have i used that is not supportable by historical data or reasonable projection?

Base on TS's belief.  Anytime is a good time to buy properties becos in the long run, it will be up, be it 10yrs or 30, 40yrs.  That in the long run prices will go up will most likely hold true, And i dont think we dispute that.
 
However, most of us (if not all) in this forum have limited resources and entering (and exiting) the market at the right opportune can make a very significant difference.  That i also believe,  none of us here will be silly enough to dispute.  
 
Therefore for the astute person with a decent pot of funds, the Singapore property market is slow moving enough and simple enough to execute and make above inflation type returns.
 
Sure, there is a 10yr life for a COE, one may argue, but it is this same basis of timing, that TS has made so much analysis on and concluded that it is too high to enter COE, isnt it?   
 
Your Honor and members of the Jury, I rest my case.
Muayhahhahaha.

Aiyo TS,
 
No need to explain so much lah.
Its like you are experiencing cognitive dissonance and need to reassure yourself.
 
One thing is for sure, your Principal Gardens location is a decent one compared to many others which are priced similarly.    So i personally also think that its ok.  Not the best or greatest deal but decent lah.
 
Perhaps you need to learn to be more confident of yourself and quit your longwinded explanations.
You'll feel better after that.
 
Like i said, your money your decision your life.
If you make a load, you wont share it with us.
If you screw up, we aint gonna help you either.
 
Enjoy the holidays

As for all this bubbling, it's sharing... I have 100% assurance in my decision with my purchase of the property.  If you are following, all these came about because we are discussing lifestyles and cars.  Enye always like to dig and dig and dig, so I oblige him.

Ho... you're back... I thought you had said that you have said your final piece in the other thread?  So you want to start the discussion again?
 
I am not sure where your idea that I have not done my analysis and that the purchase is done on blind faith comes from.  Sufficient information has been shared with you on how the decision is made.   So, if you want to continue in that vein, sure, by all means...
 
But I doubt that we can continue to have any meaningful conversation since you are no longer listening...  just emoting your own fear in taking a leap forward in buying additional property.
 
The objective is never to buy at the lowest point, and even for the car, I have been prepare to buy at 100K back at beginning of 2015, knowing that COE will drop further by 2016 and 2017.  So, I am not sure why you'll seems to think that I am seeking for the lowest price.  
 
If you firstly agree that property in the long run will appreciate for my time window, then any point can be a starting point.  But there are starting points and then starting points.  Properties like cars have unique characteristics that make them not completely substitute-able.
 
So, a condo in Yishun is not equivalent of a condo in Orchard road, even if in terms of facilities, structure and price they are identical.  
There are those that are seeking for the bottom point to enter the property market, am not doing that because it requires exquisite timing.
 
All it takes is a couple of rate hikes and massive outflow of funds towards USA and you may have the government lifting the current restriction.  Then the market will lift-off.  No one, not even the minister himself is sure when they will make that decision.  
 
However, Principal Garden has good location going for it, near Chinatown, CBD and Orchard Turn.  And it's priced attractively lower than it's neighbouring projects that have been launched within the year.  
 
If you have gone to the showrooms, you can see the counterpart developer desperately trying to draw the crowds over next door to its project.  I did not take the bait... why?  Because it price way higher than what I can at Principal Garden 
 
I probably can wait a couple more months but how much further will property prices fall within that time?  And will I still be able to buy the unit with the location, facing and layout that I desire?
 
Anyway, I doubt you will be convinced since you are looking at it from a accounting practice approach, trying to figure out NPV and so on.
Hopefully you don't belong to the group of people that I don't really like in all the company I have work so far, ie the FC. Which only knows how to balance the books but don't understand how to build a business.
 
They can tell you that you are short of another 10 million in your sales pipeline but totally clueless that by restricting expenses, you cannot cover the hole in the pipe.
I have never worked in a company whose executives make business investment decisions based on blind faith and wordy justifications. 
the first things executives ask their analysts are how much will the company make(npv), what is the rate of return(atror) and when do I expect payback.  The detailed cash flows used to obtain the previously mentioned numbers would have taken into account all financial assumptions made including the macroeconomic environment.  From the basic model, different sensitivities are then developed.
 
These are what business executives right up to c suite executives ask on every single investment they are considering.  Accounting people are not even involved in such analyses.
 
But like what t2 said, it's your money.  Invest it in whatever way you like.  And yeah continue to dislike the fc group.

If you have gone to the showrooms, you can see the counterpart developer desperately trying to draw the crowds over next door to its project.  I did not take the bait... why?  Because it price way higher than what I can at Principal Garden 
 
I probably can wait a couple more months but how much further will property prices fall within that time?  And will I still be able to buy the unit with the location, facing and layout that I desire?
 
Anyway, I doubt you will be convinced since you are looking at it from a accounting practice approach, trying to figure out NPV and so on.
Hopefully you don't belong to the group of people that I don't really like in all the company I have work so far, ie the FC. Which only knows how to balance the books but don't understand how to build a business.
 
They can tell you that you are short of another 10 million in your sales pipeline but totally clueless that by restricting expenses, you cannot cover the hole in the pipe.
Brudder next time I do M&A and need a CEO to build up the business I look for you. You sound like an expert in building businesses lah

Of course TS is correct.
 
It comes from a famous saying.

Sorry, you lost me... what initial assumption have i used that is not supportable by historical data or reasonable projection?
 
 
Aiyah bro,
 
Its this assumption that I object to using in the model. But not because its a bad assumption or because its wrong but mainly because this one assumption will drive the whole conclusion.
 
"
Fundamental assumption : Singapore will continue to exist as a nation or if not, a quasi nation with independence and that the calibre of national leadership remain high.
"
My point is not whether property is a good or bad buy now. (This i do not know) but whether the model is a good and useful model. These are 2 different issues.
 
3 Things;
 
1) Logically you have to admit that the assumption above gets weaker the further out you project into the future.
 
2) Its a core assumption of your model.
 
3) Your model pertains to look at the very long term.
 
So in this sense, the model is poor as its core assumption gets weaker in the period that it aims to look at.
 
But let me be more constructive here and describe my way of looking at properties. (Feedback and suggestions welcome)
 
1) The most important overlying factor is the economics, demographics, and trends of the country I wish to buy property in;
 
2) Next comes looking at the individual sectors and their dynamics. Sectors that I will look at will be;

2) Next comes looking at the individual sectors and their dynamics. Sectors that I will look at will be;
 
a) Residential
b) Industrial
c) Retail
d) Office
e) Logistics
f) Medical
 
Each of these sectors will have different characteristics and government regulations. Eg in Singapore, we have ABSD for residential properties and this year we had the ban on subletting HDB industrial properties which had great impact on the relevant sectors.
 
3) Finally, we look at the expression of the investment idea. This will be driven by liquidity, funding, and leverage concerns. Broadly, you can chose to;
 
i) Buy the actual development
ii) Buy into a reit
iii) Buy into a property developer
 
 
 
One thing is for sure, your Principal Gardens location is a decent one compared to many others which are priced similarly. So i personally also think that its ok. Not the best or greatest deal but decent lah. 
 
However, most of us (if not all) in this forum have limited resources and entering (and exiting) the market at the right opportune can make a very significant difference. That i also believe, none of us here will be silly enough to dispute.

I C.  True, But if you look at the implications of that assumption not coming true, it would be very frightening to have ended up in that state.  No?
- blown up by terrorist nuclear devices
- invaded by foreign country
- drown under the waters by global climate changes
- broken/sunk by earthquakes/tsunamis
- killed off by nuclear plant disaster in neighbouring countries
- zombified by some virulent form of mutated diseases
- dismember by civil war
 
In any of these kinds of scenarios, there's no where, no assets that you can run to to protect from the impending doom.
 
Or have I totally misunderstood your point again?

HUAT AH!!!!!!
 
   

 
I c.  that's a lot more systematic than me!
 
Probably because, retail, commercial, industry and agriculture properties have already been mentally eliminated from my option list.
Likewise REIT are out.   Shares in properties are treated under share asset class and manage differently.

Properties in Singapore (long-term prospects):
 
The economic fundamentals of the country have to be further strengthened. The emphasis on innovation cannot let up - we have to produce our own Googles, Facebooks, and the like. For that to happen, there needs to be paradigm shifts in culture, mindsets and negative connotations regarding failure. Focus on real-world knowledge and ability, and not on academic grades. Stress on perseverance and competitiveness, and not on self-centred advancement.
 
Without the above, our best bet is demographic expansion (aka Ponzi demography) in which we leverage on our branding and international fame to keep bringing new imports (talent and otherwise) into the country who will contribute to the GDP and economic growth at the expense of stiff and considerably unhealthy competition for housing and infrastructure. 
 
The performance of the property market in Singapore since independence in 1965 has been stellar, to say the least. It has been riding on the back of strong fundamental growth pillars of the country (up to early 2000s) and a substantial increase in population size (to date). How much more growth in both these aspects are needed to propel the property market further?
 
A quick back-of-the-envelope calculation will show that our population size needs to go way beyond the current 5.4m into the early teens in order to sustain the same rate of property price-growth that we have seen the last five decades.
 
At the same time, if national income levels have not been growing at the same rate, then the outcome of further price increases will be an unstable and unsustainable property market inflated purely by influx of investment monies from outside Singapore, and not by genuine localised demand. And we know how that typically ends up.
 
Properties in Singapore (near-term and mid-term prospects):
 
There have been many analogies that have been made regarding the size and nature of our economy. The most visible metaphor has been that of a sampan (albeit one that is a supposedly improved version 2.0). The turbulent waves of the global financial waters easily unsettle the small vessel that we are, throwing us about in the chaos ensuing from international political and economic strife. 
 
It is quite apparent that the global economy is faltering. Trade has been dwindling at a precarious pace and we are beginning to see swift implosion of prominent funds vested in bonds (from junk to IG). Major indices have been struggling with (and a significant number already breaking below) key support levels and there does not seem a bottom in sight for commodities such as crude, iron ore and the like.
 
To top it off, the Fed has just hiked their benchmark interest rate in spite of global economic headwinds. 
 
O&G bonds will be the group to watch moving into the first quarter of 2016. The damage incurred in this category will set off a chain reaction of redemptions and defaults in other bond categories. In the event this blow-up cascades and develops further, a credit crisis could well come about. This shall further impede lending, trigger more unwinding and deleveraging, thereby resulting in increased refinancing failures and thereby worsening the debt situation.
 
It would be prudent to pay heed to the above developments and not throw caution to the wind where large purchases are concerned, especially if any form of debt/leverage is involved. 
 
 

This thread arises of a discussion initiate in the car/lifestyle section.  However, some very interesting points came up as to how Singapore properties should be considered.  The emphasis is deliberate as the model only works for Singapore.
 
There are a lot of property gurus here, so please ignore this un-sophisticated newbie who is just venturing into property and trying to justify his purchases.
 
Fundamental assumption : Singapore will continue to exist as a nation or if not, a quasi nation with independence and that the calibre of national leadership remain high.
 
Let with with an analogy from Singapore/Malaya history; Rubber planting.
 
As all Singaporean students knows from their history books, rubber tree takes 5 - 7 years to mature.
 
So, any businessman intending to venture into this industry has to
1. Buy the land
2. Clear the land 
3. Plant the cuttings and continue to care for the younglings
 
These are the years where there are negative profits as the businessman has to continue to pour money into his investment with no guarantee on returns (storm blows down estate, commodity prices collapse, disease toll on trees, etc).
 
However, if the plantation make it through and extraction starts, profits will start to flow in and can continue to flow for another 25 years or more.  Also, the rubber estate itself also gain value as it could be sold to buyers with a risk premium for taking on the early year risk.
 
One thing that a number of people keep telling me is rental margins and so on... but they always left me scratching my head, the time horizon they use is very short.
 
Like rubber planting, buying property for me is for the long haul with time horizon of 30 - 40 years or more.  Analogous
1. Buy the property
2. Do interior finishing
3. Continue to care for the property
 
These are the years where profits may be negative (if you cannot find a tenant) as the investors has to pour money into the investment.  
 
However, once the mortgage is paid off, profits will start to flow in and continue to flow as long as you own that property.  That is not in addition to capital appreciation if you sell off the property.  
 
So, the total cost and total profit that can be taken from the property over a time horizon of 30 - 40 years is actually more important then short term rental margins gained while the mortgage is still in force.

Thanks for the analysis.  That's nice.
 
For me, I believe that we are at the tail end of the 60 year K wave,  We have seen economic recession across multiple countries across the globe for the past decade, and the start of commodity deflation.  We also know that despite the massive reserve stockpile by China, there are even a greater mass of debt and over-capacity hidden behind the firewall of China.
 
How that will play out will be interesting...  there are signs that China may use militarisms to divert attention outwards.  This accounts for the strength of the expansionist faction in China that's driving the recent conflicts in South China Sea.
 
This means that our economy may be hit from the eastward end but given our current geopolitical positioning, hopefully we will ride out that unscathe.  After all, war is good for business as long as you are not caught in it.
 
As to when the new K wave cycle will start, it's hard to predict, but my bets will be on biotechnology or low energy industry which has been incubating for the last 60 years.  As the major industrialised countries re-pivot their industry towards technologies that uses less energy, we will see efficiencies and therefore real economic gains accumulating.
 
It's with this background that I am basing my optimistic view of Singapore.  The quotation has always serve me well, "The night is the darkest just before dawn".  So, hang on there, Singapore may seems to be slowing and the problems may seems insurmountable, and the answers does not seems to be there.  
 
No one predicted back in the 60's/70's that semi-conductor industry and computing industry would have so much impact on the global economy, yet the world made it through those dark times of the 70s.

The deflationary pressures of today are real and here to stay for a while. Besides commodities, we are seeing its impact on asset classes - properties, equities, precious stones and metals, and such. And it would appear to be getting worse. Just a few days ago, it was reported that Nov CPI has fallen for the 13th straight month since 2014. However, the more diplomatic term for this seems to be "negative inflation" rather than in-your-face "deflation". Debt-fueled growth over the last few years is now exacting its payback on the global economy. 
 
Much as mainstream media does not wish to play up the militarisation of the countries in the region, we cannot deny the fact that Japan has been striving for military "normalcy" backed by the US, China is building its second aircraft carrier, etc - the prelude to arms race per se.
 
From: http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/us-admiral-warns-of-risk-of-arms-race-in-south-china-sea
 
All that will take subsequently is an unfortunate incident, either fortuitous or insidiously planned for, to be the last straw that breaks the camel's back, sparking military conflict from an already tense situation.
 
Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Some will term this pessimism but others will consider it pragmatic to exercise more care and prudence in light of current macroeconomic and geo-political tension. The adage "be greedy when others are fearful" has its time and place, and, in my humble opinion, the current situation is not it.

PS: On a side note. Had too much wine last night. Massive hangover. Anyone know anything to take for that?Hangover headaches is because wine or alcohol is also diuretics like coffee, it caused you to loose water, blood vessels compensate the loss by dilating to allow more blood flow, thus more water.  
Our brain contains lots of water, so when blood vessels expand to get more water, that when you feel the throbbing headaches. The pain is caused the pressure from dilated. vessels.

The thread broke so let me continue here.

But let me be more constructive here and describe my way of looking at properties. (Feedback and suggestions welcome)

1) The most important overlying factor is the economics, demographics, and trends of the country I wish to buy property in;

2) Next comes looking at the individual sectors and their dynamics. Sectors that I will look at will be;

a) Residential
b) Industrial
c) Retail
d) Office
e) Logistics
f) Medical

Each of these sectors will have different characteristics and government regulations. Eg in Singapore, we have ABSD for residential properties and this year we had the ban on subletting HDB industrial properties which had great impact on the relevant sectors.

3) Finally, we look at the expression of the investment idea. This will be driven by liquidity, funding, and leverage concerns. Broadly, you can chose to;

i) Buy the actual development
ii) Buy into a reit
iii) Buy into a property developer
 
 

But we won't even know who will be the governing party, much less the prime minister and minister of national development in 20 years time, how to analyse factors like "the economics, demographics, and trends of the country"?
 
But I have to agree with your line of thoughts and I opine that there is a more than 60% chance prices of SG properties will be higher in 2030 than what it is today.  You have highlighted logical issues/data to delve into but sometimes too much analysis may not be good, just like during Lehman crisis, so many of my friends, especially those in the finance sector who knew too much, made so little money out of it while the non financial people managed to pick up some cheap stocks and properties.

As for all this bubbling, it's sharing... I have 100% assurance in my decision with my purchase of the property.  If you are following, all these came about because we are discussing lifestyles and cars.  Enye always like to dig and dig and dig, so I oblige him.
He always dig me also, but i dont say anything.I only dig him back and poke him on his miserable amount of cash / liquidity.
Its all good and fun.
 
In all honesty, i find the analysis of yours, edwin'sand seohster's very similar.

Only the intention to promote differing viewpoints by examining assumptions and conclusions are the same. Otherwise, our areas of interests differ significantly.  
For example, I will not go for rental play oriented properties such as Poiz unless it is also freehold and rent prices can compete with HDB. Poiz is value proposition but not my type.
 
For the last time, there is only one of me in this forum. Please do respect the different views as much as I respect yours.

Talking about residential properties that have not TOP around the Alexandra Road area:
 
Average Selling Price per sq ft
The Crest: $1,800 (1st launch)
Echelon: $1,7000 (early phase), $1,795 (project)  (fully sold)
Alex Residences: $1,650
Principal Garden: $1,600
 
Principal Garden condo is the cheapest (price per sq ft) among the 4 condos around.
 
In terms of location, The Crest and Principal Garden condos are on the other side of Alexandra Road opposite the Redhill MRT, while Echelon and Alex Residences condos are alongside the Redhill MRT.  For those who desire a shorter distance, Echelon and Alex Residences are better buys.
 
In Nov 2015, a land parcel next to the Redhill MRT was awarded to Tang Skyline Pte Ltd, at $851 psf ppr.  I am looking at Principal Gardens, and this new possibility could be cheaper than the rest.  I wonder how the developer will price this new condo.  We can only know in a few months' time.  It will provide a gauge to all of us, how the developer feels about the general mood of user's affordability this year, for this Alexandra Road area.

This thread arises of a discussion initiate in the car/lifestyle section.  However, some very interesting points came up as to how Singapore properties should be considered.  The emphasis is deliberate as the model only works for Singapore.
 
There are a lot of property gurus here, so please ignore this un-sophisticated newbie who is just venturing into property and trying to justify his purchases.
 
Fundamental assumption : Singapore will continue to exist as a nation or if not, a quasi nation with independence and that the calibre of national leadership remain high.
 
Let with with an analogy from Singapore/Malaya history; Rubber planting.
 
As all Singaporean students knows from their history books, rubber tree takes 5 - 7 years to mature.
 
So, any businessman intending to venture into this industry has to
1. Buy the land
2. Clear the land 
3. Plant the cuttings and continue to care for the younglings
 
These are the years where there are negative profits as the businessman has to continue to pour money into his investment with no guarantee on returns (storm blows down estate, commodity prices collapse, disease toll on trees, etc).
 
However, if the plantation make it through and extraction starts, profits will start to flow in and can continue to flow for another 25 years or more.  Also, the rubber estate itself also gain value as it could be sold to buyers with a risk premium for taking on the early year risk.
 
One thing that a number of people keep telling me is rental margins and so on... but they always left me scratching my head, the time horizon they use is very short.
 
Like rubber planting, buying property for me is for the long haul with time horizon of 30 - 40 years or more.  Analogous
1. Buy the property
2. Do interior finishing
3. Continue to care for the property
 
These are the years where profits may be negative (if you cannot find a tenant) as the investors has to pour money into the investment.  
 
However, once the mortgage is paid off, profits will start to flow in and continue to flow as long as you own that property.  That is not in addition to capital appreciation if you sell off the property.  
 
So, the total cost and total profit that can be taken from the property over a time horizon of 30 - 40 years is actually more important then short term rental margins gained while the mortgage is still in force.

For plantations near cities, sometimes there is a chance they can be rezoned for something more valuable

Aiyah bro,
 
Its this assumption that I object to using in the model. But not because its a bad assumption or because its wrong but mainly because this one assumption will drive the whole conclusion.
 
"
Fundamental assumption : Singapore will continue to exist as a nation or if not, a quasi nation with independence and that the calibre of national leadership remain high.
"
My point is not whether property is a good or bad buy now. (This i do not know) but whether the model is a good and useful model. These are 2 different issues.
 
3 Things;
 
1) Logically you have to admit that the assumption above gets weaker the further out you project into the future.
 
2) Its a core assumption of your model.
 
3) Your model pertains to look at the very long term.
 
So in this sense, the model is poor as its core assumption gets weaker in the period that it aims to look at.
 
But let me be more constructive here and describe my way of looking at properties. (Feedback and suggestions welcome)
 
1) The most important overlying factor is the economics, demographics, and trends of the country I wish to buy property in;
 
2) Next comes looking at the individual sectors and their dynamics. Sectors that I will look at will be;

You are right
 
If Singapore continues to be a top nation, price in singapore will be high due to little land.
 
The value of land is linked to many things. There is a lot of land in Africa but in this present time, it will never be worth as much as Singapore because there is a lot of high value activity here.
 
so the assumption that Singapore will continue is a good one to think about.

The dynamics of the country will depend how aggressive and determine people want "success". Now given the new generation of Singaporean or strawberry generation- can they drive the country like our forefather.
 
given the interconnect of the world with no border- how Singapore can stay relevant and value creation into the future is still unknown. All the speculation of property up in the long term is mere speculation without any basis or pre-suppose assumption based on historical trend.
 
Past performance is never a reflection of the future but merely to study carefully with probability the % of winning. The bottom line is talent or people with idea that will prosper the economy- created the wealth effect and supply and demand for property that people want to stay here to make money or opportunity.
 
Singapore is never cheap in terms of cost of living- where is the comparative advantage in comparison to other country- it is only those country with their domestic turmoil that we strive in the current enviornment based on current status quo.

When one has carefully considered what created the success of SG in the last 50 years, one will be able to understand the solutions we have used to address the issues pointed out. What exactly is SG?

Ho... you're back... I thought you had said that you have said your final piece in the other thread?  So you want to start the discussion again?
 
I am not sure where your idea that I have not done my analysis and that the purchase is done on blind faith comes from.  Sufficient information has been shared with you on how the decision is made.   So, if you want to continue in that vein, sure, by all means...
 
But I doubt that we can continue to have any meaningful conversation since you are no longer listening...  just emoting your own fear in taking a leap forward in buying additional property.
 
The objective is never to buy at the lowest point, and even for the car, I have been prepare to buy at 100K back at beginning of 2015, knowing that COE will drop further by 2016 and 2017.  So, I am not sure why you'll seems to think that I am seeking for the lowest price.  
 
If you firstly agree that property in the long run will appreciate for my time window, then any point can be a starting point.  But there are starting points and then starting points.  Properties like cars have unique characteristics that make them not completely substitute-able.
 
So, a condo in Yishun is not equivalent of a condo in Orchard road, even if in terms of facilities, structure and price they are identical.  
There are those that are seeking for the bottom point to enter the property market, am not doing that because it requires exquisite timing.
 
All it takes is a couple of rate hikes and massive outflow of funds towards USA and you may have the government lifting the current restriction.  Then the market will lift-off.  No one, not even the minister himself is sure when they will make that decision.  
 
However, Principal Garden has good location going for it, near Chinatown, CBD and Orchard Turn.  And it's priced attractively lower than it's neighbouring projects that have been launched within the year.  
 
If you have gone to the showrooms, you can see the counterpart developer desperately trying to draw the crowds over next door to its project.  I did not take the bait... why?  Because it price way higher than what I can at Principal Garden 
 
I probably can wait a couple more months but how much further will property prices fall within that time?  And will I still be able to buy the unit with the location, facing and layout that I desire?
 
Anyway, I doubt you will be convinced since you are looking at it from a accounting practice approach, trying to figure out NPV and so on.
Hopefully you don't belong to the group of people that I don't really like in all the company I have work so far, ie the FC. Which only knows how to balance the books but don't understand how to build a business.
 
They can tell you that you are short of another 10 million in your sales pipeline but totally clueless that by restricting expenses, you cannot cover the hole in the pipe.
Wahh for a civil servant clerk to b able to afford principal garden, u must be heck of a high flying clerk.. haha

History shows that city states seldom last.  
 
For rich, they can park some wealth outside SG, for most of us, almost everything is here (cash, CPF, properties, investment, etc), so better borrow more and hope the 1-way bet won't go wrong and all will huat in this lifetime.

There is no economic "model" in this thread. Are you buying a property for stay or investment? For own stay, buy a nice landed house and that should be ok as land is scarce and should preserve some value in the long haul. For investment, most investors look at cash flows, IRR and yields - not long essay of how Singapore come from fishing village and how property should go up after 40 years. 40 years! Life is too short to wait 40 years for anything. Like someone earlier mentioned, people look at fundamentals and cash flows. So if property currently only gives 2 t0 3% yields at today's prices, why should I invest in property if other less risky asset classes with lower transaction costs and greater liquidity can generate superior yields? And 40 years investment horizon? I want to start enjoying life now. I prefer my assets to generate returns ASAP and don't believe in living and saving for the next generation. So well, not convinced with the long essay.

With so many new condo coming onboard, expats are spoil with choice.
 
Rental income will start to reduce from Year 5 onwards & expenses will start to increase from Year 5 onwards.
 
If the property cannot turn a good return (minimum 3%) after deducting all expense incurred (including additional income tax), mind as well put it in CPF special account.

Aiya ... TS just doing self justifications .... to convince that he has made the best decision in investing his money to buy his unit in PG.
 
It is his money and frankly none of my business as I have mentioned before his decision is the bestest, no horse run, sure win one.
 
What economic model ?????
 
All I know that the bank will ask for top-up if the value of the property drops ... for example, the loan is based on a value of 2 Million and loan amount is 1.6 Million .... If the valuation of the property drops to 1.5 Million, the bank can ask for top up.
 
At the end of the day .... who knows whether it is "win" or "lose" ? 40 years is a bloody long time and the 99 years lease would be left with 50 years ....
 
TS may have the last laugh .... but good luck lor
