yup, i went to see showroom.
 
its lousy design basically.
 
unit is too small for a proper family to stay.
 
the washing machine is actually inside the kitchen cabinet. 
 
no service area for utility, no storeroom. 
 
the whole concept of the design is focused in the master room, where the it has a balcony. 
 
the other parts of unit is useless.
 
as for rental, i think it will still be a good yield coz of location.  there will be new hospital setups around TTSH.... so potential to rent out to foriegners.

Yes, my intention is to get it purely for rental. Was quoted abt $500K for 441sqf studio on low flr.  This translates to abt $1.1K psf
 
Is it worth it?

You might want to use to give you a rough idea of your monthly morgage. Then you can weigh against your rental yield to see if it's gonna reap decent profits as vs your risks

Very ex.
 
Why not look at older condos in prime locations.  Some are usually cheaper and can rent out immediately.  There are some studio or 2 bedroom in freehold River Valley, Newton, Bukit Timah and Novena (district 9,10,11) asking for low $1xxx+ psf.  Used to own a 2 bedder with big patio in River Valley, it is fairly new - less than 4 years old, small apartment block with modern design, sold it last year, now you can get a unit in the same development for around $1200psf or less if you bargain hard. Good for renting to expats.  hint: one of my ex-neighbours drove a black 335i cab with faux-euro plates... 
 
I have a friend just bought a 2 bedroom 99yr leasehold in Tanglin for only about $150k more than a 4 room Redhill HDB.... this condo is technically still in district 10, although it is partly fronting Alexandra Road. Compare that to the new leasehold Capitaland condo nearby and this is definitely value for money... even taking into account the depreciating nature of a leasehold private property.
 
Last week I saw in the newspapers a 3 bedroom condo near the Bukit Timah end of Sixth Ave asking only $900+ psf.  Surrounding properties are landed semi-d and bungalows.  It is not new, but it is nothing that a small reno job won't correct.  You should check the classifieds...
 
I won't name the condo names, so you have to search yourself.  Good deals are not hard to come by these days, but you gotta look.  And no one can guarantee market won't crash.. especially since you mentioned you were looking for property as investment.

Guys, anyone went to the showroom?  Any property agent bros care to comment on the location and rent potential of this development? 
http://sfsrealty.wordpress.com/2008/02/24/...rve-residences/
 
Thanks.

 
  Thank you for using my link. 
 
Well, I am the marketing agent for this project and also many many other new launches coming up. I will be glad to assist if you have any query on this project or others.
 
The layout of this project is very subjective. Depends on individual view point of a home. 
 
If we do look around, there are more and more upcoming projects at the Core City Fringe with this kind of layout. Space is limited in good location. Thus, we have to adjust our mindset.
 
I totally agree that this is a small house. And, in the years to come, house will get smaller and smaller. Even HDB is moving towards smaller unit compared to one designed 20years ago.
 
In terms of rental yield, this project has a potential of reaching 5% to 5.5% gross. With the Interest Absorption Scheme, we just need to pay 5% CASH + 15% CPF/CASH and Stamp Duty. All other loan payment ONLY starts upon TOP. Paying a Normal Payment Scheme Price and ENJOY the benefits of a Deferred Payment Scheme structure.
 
Curtin University is coming in NOv'08, Queen Victoria Uni is here now, Posh Hotel developement just around the corner, nearby Medical HUB in NOvena Area(We wanna be near but not within the zone)

Guys, anyone went to the showroom?  Any property agent bros care to comment on the location and rent potential of this development? 
http://sfsrealty.wordpress.com/2008/02/24/...rve-residences/
 
Thanks.

 
I went to see the showflat today.
 
Now thinking of a "big unit". Shall not say which one.
 
The location is good. Just one-two minutes walk and is Balestier road. 
 
The units are mainly 2 or 2+1 units. Not for big families, but I heard some buyers bought two units and break down the center. I don't have kids, so a 2 or 2+1 rooms development is great. And because it is all small units, I don't have to endure noises from kids during weekends.
 
Some people complain no space for utility and all that, come on..thesedays people use dryer la....you don't need space to hang up clothes.
 
The only thing I don't like is many tall buildings around. I wanted an open rooftop to see stars, but I think it will be all block by surrounding buildings even at the 19th floor.
 
The $1,100 psf said by the TS is due to small unit. Get a bigger one and the psf will drop to around $900
 
And btw, the manintenance at around $150-$200 is pretty good. A nearby new condo, D'Lotus is quoting a maintenance of more than $300 even for a 2 bedroom. It's crazy.
 
For those who think property prices will come crashing down, quite honestly, it's not going to happen. But this will be a slow period. 
 
I also went to Telok Kurau to take a look at those low rise apartments. Surrounding all landed, very exclusive area. And surprisingly, many of all these low rise had been snapped up. I thought buyers are playing a waiting game? Was trying to look at a 2 bedroom penthouse at this area, but all taken. Wonder where is that wait as see as reported by media.
 
Also was at VOGX situated at Dorset Court. That one the price is even more crazy compare to Verve.

hi, 
 
finally theres someone who have intention to get a unit here. Did u try to walk to toa payoh from the Verve? I did and it took a mere 10-15 mins at a very slow leisure pace to Toa Payoh central/MRT. It is also close proximity to Balestier Plaza/Shaw Plaza.
 
Studio costs abt $1100psf but they are all sold out. My fren got a 796sqf unit at $1000psf. If u intend to get, do bargain for at least 10% off cos my fren did just that. If u want, i can get her to intro u her agent.
 
One thing abt maintenance fee, they may quote 150/200 now but its all subjected to changes.
 
BTW, do u have any idea how many units left?

Hi Bro,
 
Can't remember how many but I was looking at 2 bedrooms and I don't think there are many left.
 
If 2 bedrooms not many left, then I guess the smaller ones should be gone by now.
 
The location is not bad actually. If I walk my normal speed, I could get to Toa Payoh MRT in 7-8 minutes.
 
What I like is that a few minutes walk out and is Balestier. Outside easy to get to CTE, PIE and all. Plenty of eateries and NTUC is just nearby at Balestier Plaza. Even the cinema there is cheaper than those in towns.
 
As for the maintenance, obviously it will go up from time to time, but at least the starting seems reasonable.
 
I know many people think the psf is expensive, but if you buying for stay, location is more important than $$$. It's not like you going to flip the property in two years and worried the market crash. A good unit at Balestier can stay there for 10-20 years or more.  If buying for investment, the rental yield there is not bad. If market goes bad, your interest rate will also drop so go for variable rates if you worry about loan. 
 
During the 2003, 2004, everyone was waiting while I was busy looking around. It was the best decision ever. The next 6 months or so will be a good time to scout around. The market is going to be slow and the thing about property market is that the longer it "slow", the deeper the pain felt by the developer because they already pay for the land and development cost. It's not like individuals where if the the market slow, we just keep the cash and ride it out. So developers will be squeezed which open them up for bargains. When the market picks up again, there is no way you can do that. 
 
At this moment, some area psf has already came down.  A 2 bedroom Penthouse (freehold) in Telok Kurau cost only 717 psf. Last time it was at 800psf. Can easily bargain till 700 psf if the buyer is serious.
 
The bigger units at the Verve is around $900psf. Can try for $870psf. The developer has already make money from the other units, so the last 15% they are willing to go for lesser profits to quickly recover their cost. It also depend on the agents. Some agents die die must earn $$$, so they keep saying developer not willing to drop price. 
 
Any other units u looking at bro?

Yo bro, 
 
Agree with you on the pt on mkt softening... IMHO, mky will stay flat for a while before surging again. Point is simple, all the upcoming IRs, population growth, etc.
 
As for Verve, you can get another 2 NTUCs in Toa Payoh too... Not a bad investment really. You mentioned you've been scouting ard during 03/04? Did u get a unit then? If yes, sure make money now. 
 
I have also looked at the Vutton in Novena.. dun really like it cos its really close to TTSH... you know lah.. some ppl pang tang, so that may limit my potential tenant pool in future. Somemore the edge of TTSH is pointing directly at the Vutton.. abit inauspicious..if you know abit of geomancy.
 
I wouldn't advise telok kurau... but it really depends on individuals. I went to view D'casita at Lor Mazuki a few months back. It is close to Kembangan Mrt and thats about it. No supermarts nearby.. only one 7-11. Also, that place is perpetually jammed.. Another bad if you are driving... ECP..u know lah in the morn and evening..is gonecase one.  For the Verve, its ok cos if you drive from town to Balestier using CTE, its not that far away and no ERPs along the way. 
 
One thing you may wish to consider is the facing of the unit. Avoid east west facing... its gonna be hot!

Only Asian tenant pang tang about hospital.  Most Ang Mor, Middle Eastern, and Japanese tenant are not. In fact they think it is convenient. 
 
Please note that I am not endorsing buying now for investment. If own stay, then fine if you have planned for the loan repayments.
 
If you are looking at Balestier area condos, maybe you should monitor the big City Developments condo at the junction of Thomson and Balestier Road and take your cue from there.  That is likely to be the price setter and market gauge for the area.  However due to the current lacklustre market, don't think they will be launching it any time soon.

Very ex. 
Why not look at older condos in prime locations.  Some are usually cheaper and can rent out immediately.  There are some studio or 2 bedroom in freehold River Valley, Newton, Bukit Timah and Novena (district 9,10,11) asking for low $1xxx+ psf.  Used to own a 2 bedder with big patio in River Valley, it is fairly new - less than 4 years old, small apartment block with modern design, sold it last year, now you can get a unit in the same development for around $1200psf or less if you bargain hard. Good for renting to expats.  hint: one of my ex-neighbours drove a black 335i cab with faux-euro plates... 
 
I have a friend just bought a 2 bedroom 99yr leasehold in Tanglin for only about $150k more than a 4 room Redhill HDB.... this condo is technically still in district 10, although it is partly fronting Alexandra Road. Compare that to the new leasehold Capitaland condo nearby and this is definitely value for money... even taking into account the depreciating nature of a leasehold private property.
 
Last week I saw in the newspapers a 3 bedroom condo near the Bukit Timah end of Sixth Ave asking only $900+ psf.  Surrounding properties are landed semi-d and bungalows.  It is not new, but it is nothing that a small reno job won't correct.  You should check the classifieds...
 
I won't name the condo names, so you have to search yourself.  Good deals are not hard to come by these days, but you gotta look.  And no one can guarantee market won't crash.. especially since you mentioned you were looking for property as investment.

 
whats the going price of a 2 bedder in bkt timah, tiong bahru, Newton? at least 1million?

It depends on the age, condition, location (even within those areas, some locations are better than others) Some yes, some no. Can get $700k-$800k for a say, 850 to 900 square feet 2 bedroom if you looked hard enough.

Umm..serious the corner of TTSH pointing at Vutton? Wah..not very good. I was looking at Vutton too because many 2 bedrooms there. 
 
I was at D-casita too. The place is quiet la, but if no car, sure die. Nothing much around. It's an exclusive rich men area that probably they don't go work at normal hours so no worry about jam for them.
 
Yeah, the no ERP for the Verve to CTE is a plus. 
 
I also bought a unit in 2004. A freehold studio at BoonView, Bishan right in front of the upcoming Marymount MRT. Also, RJC just shifted there. Bought at 550 psf in 2004 now at around $800-$850 psf. Got that one because it's darn hard to get a freehold in Marymount, Jalan Pemimpin area. Rafflesia, Bishan 8 and the next door Seasons View all 99 years. Love the BoonView unit to death because low maintenance (even with a tennis court), and very quiet, since only 120 units. Don't think I will sell this to buy the Verve (or others) because I really like a studio unit (and it's facing the pool). Probably rent it out to some rich kid in RJC or RI
 
By the way, I heard the D'Lotus (just TOP, Lorong Ampas behind balestier plaza) had a 570psf studio just rented out for 2.8K!! Darn crazy but the rental market is way better than the new market now.

There is a pent-up demand as i have mentioned months ago.  which is why the property market in my opinion will not slump by too much. (Max 20%)
 
however pent-up demand is unlike speculative demand which moves like a tidal wave.
So dont expect prices to go up until the global issues and inflationary pressures have been sort out.
 
Not forgetting many people are signing under peer pressure.
they are always keeping up with the Joneses whether they can afford to or not.
Dont fall into that trap , life is about balance.

Bro, many new developments in Bukit Timah area is going for $1300 -$1400 psf which in my opinion is crazy. I honestly do not know what is the draw of Bukit Timah unless you love greenery and like many schools around. Got only one PIE and it's not really too near to town also. Rather consider Novena at around $1000 psf.

Depends on which part of Bukit timah becos it is really a very long road.
Upper is not fantastic becos of location.
Nearer to Farrer, Watten, University , Gallop, Kheamhock mostly are landed homes which leaves many of us out.
 
Property is not only about location, it is also about environment around the location, more importantly

Yeah I think he was asking mostly along the prime Dunearn Rd and Bukit Timah Rd stretch, the lower part of BKT.  I was alerted to one older 999 yr condo along the further part of Dunearn Rd, quite near Jardin, desperately asking for low $psf, average size about 1200 sf. But I don't really like it.
 
Upper BKT and Hillview still has a lot of condos going cheap.  But not so good for investment lah IMO... 
 
In the lower part of BKT there are some condos that I think should be quite reasonably priced... 19 Shelford, Kellett Court, Villa Azura.. which are situated among landed properties.

Thats what I thought too...pent-up demands will, to a certain extent, prevent the market from crashing (after 2008 as predicted by some property analysts). There are still many potential buyers that are holding out due to the current high price.
 
Just 10 months ago, while doing an open house to rent out my family's apartment, there are offers from 2 singaporean families to rent. A check with them revealed that they only want to hold out in anticipation of a property downturn within the next 2 years.

Hillview condos are not really cheap. Personally, if I want to stay in that area, I'd rather get one of those condos in bukit batok around the nature park/little guilin. 
 
Its just a stons's throw away from hillview with much better ameneties (due to bukit batok being a fully developed town).
 
Price is generally 10% cheaper than hillview.

Thesedays, small apartments are easier to rent out. Studios are in high demand because too few of them (unless city, orchard area) in the outskirts of the city. In the past, many developers go for 3 or 4 bedrooms. Thesedays, city outskirts area (balestier, Novena, etc) all mainly go for 2 or 2+1. Actually it make more sense since they can earn higher psf for smaller units.
 
If can get Balestier at around 800-900 psf for FH.....I think that's pretty good liow

Sometime last year I was looking for an apt in Balestier and went to see a 1300 sq ft apt in Gallery 15.  At that time, the asking was only about $580 psf.  But did not buy cos it was on a very low floor.

So are u going to get the Verve soon? Are there still good units available?
 
Have u tried to walk to Novena MRT? How far is it away from the Verve?
 
Since you are sort of having the same investment objective as me (i.e. stay in one and rent out one), would you be able to share what are the things to look out for in such investment? For me, my strategy is to stay in bigger unit and rent out studio 1st. When the time comes for me to retire, I would rent out the bigger one and stay in studio...
 
Heard that Casa Fortuna next door was totally sold out during launch. Ppl literally have to queue early in the morning to get a unit. Not sure how true it is...

To me, the next wave will be landed homes.
 
for condos, supply is "infinite" becos you can just build it up.
 
in the years to come, good landed home prices will climb much higher. Even PRs are realising this if singaporeans are not.  of course the living experience is diff and it is more difficult to transact as each is more unique compared to condos.  supply is "finite"

Hi Guys,
 
What do your think of Viz@Holland? It has 1bdrm up to 3 bdrms I tink. I like the location a lot, it's a short drive to AYE, PIE, Holland V, Orchard and the schools in Bukit Timah.
 
However, understand a young Chinese woman was found murdered in one of the lower floor units during construction. Is it true? Anyone knows which unit? 
 
Also, I saw the psf of the latest transaction (from URA) drop so much from $1,235 to 703 psf[jawdrop] I wonder y...

Unfortunately the good landed homes are all in D10 and D11 Holland, Bukit Timah.  Even a small old intermediate terrace there will cost upwards of $3 million.  My parents are still holding their landed here and renting it out, but it is hard for others to resist the temptation to cash in.  A couple of my friends' parents have sold their landed in Bukit Timah... now cannot buy back already..
 
Small landed homes in the East, D15 ie:- Siglap are still available for $1+ million though.

Could be uncle sell to nephew, or father sell to son. Or company sell to its own shareholder.

No, Casa Fortuna was not sold out during the launch. It was already sold out before launch. Some of the potential buyer have to ballot for the units some more. It was crazy.

actually for investment would not it be more prudent to get your second property overseas? 
 
I am thinking about 2nd property but still thinking of getting it overseas, like in US or Australia. But this requires more work and hassle but I feel it is better as more diversified. If singapore ever gets into trouble, you don't have all your eggs in one basket.

 A dead body was found stuffed into the store room of a unit there...not very appealing I guess.

To me, the next wave will be landed homes.
 

for condos, supply is "infinite" becos you can just build it up.
 

in the years to come, good landed home prices will climb much higher. Even PRs are realising this if singaporeans are not.  of course the living experience is diff and it is more difficult to transact as each is more unique compared to condos.  supply is "finite"



 

Wow, who dig up this old thread.
 

and boy, am I so right !
