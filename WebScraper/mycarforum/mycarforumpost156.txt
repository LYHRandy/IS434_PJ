Your title quite misleading, it only cease for existing owner, not new owner. And it's meant to help those existing home owner. For new buyer, it's still under the new restrictions.
 
As for cars, with 50%, it's still selling like hot cakes, without, I guess it will shoot thru roof already...

That means most existing owners (before rule change) over-extended liao? The number must be significant to effect the relaxation on this group?

I can only say it should be quite significant, the difference is huge comparing the before and after TDSR. TDSR is to prevent new buyer from busting their budget if Sibor rate goes haywire.
 
But for existing buyer that already finish their x years lock in period will feel the heat if the TDSR is in place that prevent them from refinancing. Good that MAS relax abit, else it's the bank that's smiling happily as those existing buyer will get CHOP.

Other than this small change made for existing owners who had over-stretched themselves before TDSR, I strongly support TDSR being maintained for the longer term.
 
Let's face it, not everyone can own multiple properties, nor prime D9/10 ones - esp landed.
But many had,over the last decade or so, been over-leveraged, or had resorted to flipping ... out of greed, or just to "keep up" / scared to lose out ... and taking high, long-tenure loans in that process.
 
This has got to be mitigated and TDSR will prevent that eventual bubble.

TDSR along with most of the CMs will be removed when the bubble burst and govt has to try to slow down rapidly fall of housing prices

That should not even happen ... prime properties are reserved for the elites, old money and UHNW new comers. Maybe the nuevo riche too.But definitely not for we, the peasant masses waiting for prices to fall and have a bite of the prime CCR property cherry!
It will never be allowed to happen.

The risk in the market is not the prime properties.
 
It is the suburban 99 yrs that are now $1,200 to $1,500 psf i.e. the mass market properties.
 
Do note that most of the supply in the last few years are from GLS - aka mass market.
 
there will be tons that will be up for sale at lower and lower prices.. everyone will cry mother and father and the govt will have to step in to remove CMs and TDSR so that these units can be sold to someone without prices dropping like a rock every month.

Gradual drop is much better than sudden crashes. By making restrictions , it is actually slowly preparing itself for an eventual drop.
 
The release of the tdsr can be used as a stop gap to prevent further price erosion but that said , price of properties in SG are really overinflated , especially the pigeon hole apartments.

actually... alot of ppl have not come to term that D9/10/11 are no longer the prime prime estate..
 
Those near to fast transport is.. and the rich that does not need public transport are staying in Sentosa or nearer to buzz ( recreation or business)
 
Just like in hk.. the old slump area nearer to mountains are the new prime..and 5 mins walkind distance from the mrt is consider far..
 
Visited my relative in hk..they told be they rarelly work on the street for more than 2 blocks..

my opinion is that the D9 10 11 are still prime real estate. perhaps there is a new category now - CBD area (marina bay.. not shenton way or robinson rd hor)
 
i believe the whole concept of property next to MRT being prime is a lie spun by developers to justify inflating PSF prices.
 
MRT has been around for a long time. It used to only command $200K premium to be located next to MRT.
 
But now suddenly all projects within walking distance to MRT is considered as prime? Logical to charge the same price for project situated next to CCK MRT and TPY MRT?

The new Yishun condo near to MRT is expected to be launched at around $1,500 psf. Are you aware of any development going on at Yishun?

yes, you cannot force ppl to buy just like you cannot force people not to buy (unless make it illegal to buy).
 
hence they will try to incentivize ppl to buy. what better way than to allow LTV90%? and remove all the rubbish ADSD & SSD?

restriction is one thing.
 
sibor go up going to kill alot of ppl on floating interest rates. alot of ppl didn't do their sums properly, expecting IR to remain low. 
 
interest rate go up. instalment increased. cannot cover with CPF. need to chut cash. spending power decrease leads to lower consumer demand and stagflation...
 
potential crisis in the making, me thinks.

Punggol flat sold at $60k below valuation




Flats at Punggol Breeze.

The New Paper
Tuesday, Feb 11, 2014

SINGAPORE - She viewed more than 100 flats in Punggol before she found the perfect home at a steal.
It was offered at $495,000 - a whopping $60,000 below valuation - despite being surrounded by greenery and just minutes away from the expressway.
Ms A. Lee, who is single and in her 50s, sealed the deal in December.
The general manager of a company had moved from a four-room flat just a few blocks away. Her previous flat was sold for about $460,000, which was $17,000 below valuation.
PropNex property agent Ray Sim, who sold the flat to Ms Lee, said the seller needed to move to Penang urgently, adding: "People usually sell their flats $20,000 or $30,000 below valuation, at most."
Median cash-over-valuation (COV) fell to $3,000 last month - the lowest since the 2009 financial crisis. Almost 30 per cent of Housing Board resale deals closed below valuation.
Property analyst Nicholas Mak expects median COV to remain between zero and $5,000 this year.

the problem is they can make the balloon bigger ... since the usa and euro debt crisis ... everyone expecting the bubble burst
but ... time after time ... they can make the balloon bigger and bigger
before the burst ... make the ballon bigger ... kick the can down the road ... move the goal post ... whatever
if we really believe the truth and fact and real hard data ... usa and euro is NEVER EVER can repay their debt
seriously, if you search youtube videos and google ... some doom and gloom economist already spell out clearly and the hard truth ... usa and euro can never repay their debt ... we are talking about trillion and trillion ... no way
this means the bubble is actually already burst long time ago ... so ... what burst are we talking?
the only thing we have not yet feel it is the reality ... and the reality only kick in when the water ($$) run dry
 

 
 
16 x 31,688 years = 507,008 years !!!
 
if usa can pay pack 10x faster (usd$10 per second), also requires 50,000 years
if usa can pay back 100x faster (usd$100 per second), also take 5,000 years
 
in another word, usa already told the world, hey buddy i'm not going to repay you and you gotta lend more ... else pecah lobang

Actually coming from the credit side , those swimming naked are still gonna get it. They are trying to protect the genuine 2nd hand buyers , a price reduction is always good for buyers and the market.
 
To those which are intending to stay in those homes or any property, i don't see any problems , it is always the speculators which get burnt badly during any financial crisis. People don't learn , what to do?
 
If you listen the property agent's bs on there is not cyclical price movement , then you can ignore me . To me i am viewing it in a cyclical view of bad credit. SG is simple over leverage at the moment.

Don't get it... She sold her own 4 room flat at 17k below valuation, and bought another flat at 60k below valuation... So what's the benefit? She still has to pay for 3% stamp duty right? Or maybe her old flat is haunted or something? I think it's kinda stupid to change from a flat to another in around the same neighbourhood..

If you know the average singaporean debt , you won't be laughing. They churn on average 8k a month , most of which are cars , credit cards and home related loans. We one year generate more than 90k debt per annum , so i don't think we have any right to laugh at people.

Think it this way , a normal HDB 500k at a ulu area , let's say you take 25 years
 
Based on straight line , since compounding would be even higher 500k * 0.026 * 25 = at least 325000 ~ 35000 depending whether if u have early repayment or anything.
 
500K + 325k = 825k
 
825k / (25*12) =  2.7k per month , not including any shit .
 
Tell me lor , any family earning 4k and below how to afford? And worse if one has children and a vehicle.

I find this highly suspicious this person say her 4room sold at $495k which is 60k below valuation??? which means her HDB valuation is 565k? Just a recent check at hdb resale transcation 495000 at dec only 1 unit at BLk 168A which under property guru has 4 for sale which valuation is set at 510-520 how the hell he got 565k valuation somemore its low floor 1-5 storey. I suspect is someone anyhow write to bring down the housing price in punggol.
 
A 4 room 565k Valuation by HDB? thats ridiculous do a simple search at punggol 4 room i dont see any valuation at 550 above. Crazy 4 room apt cost 565k? So many 5room at 510-550k.  Buyer must be crazy if she think she got a good deal at 1-5 storey at 495k. If beside MRT still can understand but 565k valuation means her tap all gold maybe.

HDB has no say over the price that you sell your flat unless it is a fraudulent transaction (as long as you pay what you owe them).

I can only say it should be quite significant, the difference is huge comparing the before and after TDSR. TDSR is to prevent new buyer from busting their budget if Sibor rate goes haywire.
 
But for existing buyer that already finish their x years lock in period will feel the heat if the TDSR is in place that prevent them from refinancing. Good that MAS relax abit, else it's the bank that's smiling happily as those existing buyer will get CHOP.

 
I thot this applies only to property for own stay.  those bought as investment will still subject to the TDSR.
 
How about for those who owned both HDB and private, chose to stay in private and rent out their HDB.  Would the re-financing of the private also exempted from TDSR?  Looks like loopholes in both HDB and MAS policies.

SINGAPORE - Singapore's property-upgrading dream has hit a roadblock for now.
The number of Housing Board flat dwellers lapping up condominiums or private apartments has fallen sharply, according to figures compiled by the Singapore Real Estate Exchange (SRX) for MyPaper.
Last year, the number of non-landed private residential units bought by those who owned a flat is 9,192. This is a sharp drop from 14,955 in the previous year, and 11,750 in 2011.
In terms of flat owners who bought resale condo or apartment units, the number was just 1,846 last year, around half of 3,622 in the previous year, and 3,675 in 2011.
Those seeking to upgrade have been hit by a perfect storm. At its root is the weaker HDB resale market, where cash premiums have hit their lowest point in eight years.
Property firm GPS Alliance chief executive Jeffrey Hong told MyPaper: "It's a chain effect. HDB prices are going down, so the owners are not so willing to sell and that makes it harder for them to upgrade to a condo because they will not have enough money to pay for the downpayment. Loans are also tougher to get now."
Property-services company DTZ's head of Singapore research, Ms Lee Lay Keng, said: "Flat owners can now sell only for less money and this reduces their purchasing ability."
But she noted that not all HDB owners who bought condo units are upgraders. Some could simply be investing.
Cooling measures, such as the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR), are also "obstacles" in upgrading. The TDSR prohibits borrowers from taking home loans that bring their total monthly debt repayments to over 60 per cent of their gross monthly income.
Mr Jeremy Lee, co-founder of SRX, said: "Any HDB owner who is still servicing his HDB mortgage may not have the room to enter the private market and purchase a second home."
Nor are things likely to get better. Mr Hong said: "The resale condo prices in the next few months are unlikely to change much."
National University of Singapore sociologist Tan Ern Ser explained that, apart from being a mere property transaction, upgrading was a Singaporean measure of success.
Associate Professor Tan said: "Social mobility has been very much a part of our culture, particularly since the late 1970s...The idea of success is best encapsulated in the so-called 5Cs (Cash, Car, Credit card, Condominium and Country-club membership), and ingrained in most Singaporeans."
He added: "Crossing the line between public housing and private housing is an indicator of success."

Actually he is right.. you can sell for $1 if you wish to.. but quite impossible because if you had paid through CPF, you need to topup back to cpf when you sell. Outstanding loan also need to settle.
 
that's why hdb have provision for "gifting" your hdb to immediate family. logically, you can gift your hdb if you didn t take outstanding loan or use CPF to pay your flat.

Actually , everyone is waiting to see if the there enough pigeon hole to house the pigeons...
 
There is alot numbers ard. No. of unit TOP , in progress , Immigration numbers , foreigner workers , wedding couples .. but how many home ppl is required to house the population ..All are still estimates.  Whether or not the number of units is enough ? Although the TOP units looks big.. but immigration number also very big.. 
 
We only settle 1 figure now.. that's the units required by new weds.. Those hdb upgrader that are now staying with their relative will be the 2nd number to tackle.. Also the rental mkt.
 
We will need to see if the rental mkt continue to robust with more FT renting than buying.

Don't get it... She sold her own 4 room flat at 17k below valuation, and bought another flat at 60k below valuation... So what's the benefit? She still has to pay for 3% stamp duty right? Or maybe her old flat is haunted or something? I think it's kinda stupid to change from a flat to another in around the same neighbourhood..
 
Have u gotten your own property?

 
Yes, I "lease" from HDB. So for folks like me, practically no chance to get a private property to rent out (unless have deep enough pockets).

Likely she just wanted to "cash" out her property.
Let say she bought her place at 200k (full cpf) and sold at 460k .. and buy at 430k.  
 
For the old place she gets 200k back in cash. ( minus off agent fee etc) , the rest put back into cpf.
 
For new place she need fork out ~ 20k cash ( downpayment + agent fee ) , stamp duty and 15% downpayment by CPF.
 
Bascially, she get 180k in cash.

Huh i thought HDB valuation is done by 3rd party company and it cost 190++ 
Valuation can suka suka one meh? That one transcation sold in dec has 4 listing now. None put 565k valuation lor. 
I suspect this article anyhow write wanting to crash the price of resale flat even further by posting 60k below valuation.

Meaning one bought a BTO at $400k, 5 year later when crisis hit, the valuation goes below $400k.

I do not think the government is stopping people from buying their homes, it is more of preventing property speculation. unlike Hong Kong where there isn't any public housing, Singapore is unique due to the fact that we still have a healthy mix.That said, one can always start from a 3 room and slowly move up. I do hear of people going straight for 5rm flats thinking that their income will consistently increase without putting in considerations of mishaps and other expenses. That said , 3rm are too small and too expensive even in areas far from towns. IF you want people to stay there please make it priced at 150k and below.Then again, the garmen needs to create a balance between giving our aged a chance to "encash" their property for retirement and the young which needs to buy a home at a more affordable price to facilitate family building. You want the young to populate Singapore but you are making it difficult for them to buy a house , how you expect them to marry early?I am against PRs buying HDBs, wanna buy public housing be a citizen , they serve ns or not doesn't matter but their children will need to anyway. So as long as they are properly educated and have a proper job. we should not have allowed PRs to spoil our property prices.
