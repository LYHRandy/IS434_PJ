Condo-style HDB flats: Peak price of $722k
 

The Peak @ Toa Payoh will be launched next Wednesday. -ST
 

Sat, Apr 11, 2009

The Straits Times
 

By Joyce Teo, Property Correspondent
 

WILL house hunters spend more than $700,000 on a premium HDB flat with some condo-style features in Toa Payoh?
 

A Hoi Hup-led consortium is about to find out after offering premium five-room flats at its new The Peak project for up to $722,000.
 

Analysts question whether HDB flat buyers will bite, given that they are constrained by an $8,000-a-month income ceiling and are dealing with a recession.
 

Next Wednesday, The Peak @ Toa Payoh, boasting 1,203 units in two 42-storey blocks and three 40-storey blocks, will be launched.
 

The project, at Lorong 1A Toa Payoh, comes under the design, build and sell scheme (DBSS), and offers premium fittings. But unlike private condominiums, these projects do not have facilities such as pools and gyms.
 

The smallest units - 95 of them - are the 753 sq ft three-room flats. They are priced from $355,000 to $398,000.
 

The 306 four-room flats of 980 sq ft will go for $468,000 to $582,000.
 

The next rung up the price ladder are the five-room flats, which mostly go for $539,000 to $698,000, and range from 1,184 sq ft to 1,259 sq ft.
 

The priciest of the lot are the 24 five-room high-ceiling flats costing between $700,000 and $722,000.
 

The developer - a group comprising Hoi Hup Realty, Sunway Development and Hoi Hup J.V. Development - said the flats are about $500 per sq ft (psf) to $510 psf on average. A quick calculation shows the price can go up to $594 psf.
 

A spokesman said The Peak is near Toa Payoh MRT station. And like the earlier City View DBSS project by the same group, The Peak offers an exclusive touch with a card-access security system at all ground-floor lift lobbies.
 

Buyers will also get large bay windows, Daikin air-conditioning units, built-in kitchen cabinets and wardrobes.
 

Still, industry watchers note that for the same price, buyers are spoilt for choice in the current market. Experts have said DBSS projects have to be priced lower than private flats as they are essentially HDB flats. They face restrictions such as an income cap, an ethnic quota and a minimum occupation period.
 

'Toa Payoh is a mature estate but in the current economy, there will be resistance at above $500,000,' PropNex chief executive Mohamed Ismail said yesterday.
 

Resale five-room flats in the area now cost about $450,000 on average while three-roomers go for $260,000 to $270,000 on average, though the latter are more than 30 years of age, he added.
 

Knight Frank research and consultancy director Nicholas Mak said The Peak's prices are comparable to those of resale executive condos (EC), which have condo facilities but also face public housing sale restrictions.
 

For just over $700,000, buyers can buy a private but older 99-year resale condo unit nearby, added Mr Mak.
 

For the same price as a five-room flat, they can buy a resale EC unit at a more distant location. In the first quarter, 94 EC deals were done at $579,000 on average.
 

The Peak is the fifth DBSS project. The sixth, in Simei, is expected to be released for sale soon.
 

Last year, three such projects were launched. City View in Boon Keng, Park Central @ AMK, and Natura Loft in Bishan have since sold the bulk of their units. The latest of the lot, Natura Loft, was launched late last year and has about 30 per cent left to sell, said developer QingJian Realty. Its five-roomers are already half sold, it said.
 

DBSS projects are now sandwiched in a narrowing gap between HDB resale flat prices and private condo prices.
 

'DBSS flats will be relevant again when the gap widens. In the meantime, these developers will just have to do the best they can,' said Mr Mak.

Wouldn't these group of pple rather buy a private condo ("prestige") more than a HDB flat?
 

But on another note. If a 20yr old 5 room HDB flat can go for over 600K in queenstown, how can a brand-new + premium-fitting 5 room flat beside toa payoh mrt go any lesser?

10% of $722k is already $72,200. which means $36k has to be cash and the rest from CPF.
 

assuming full 30 yr loan, each month is roughly $3.2k
 

assuming $8k income, you are left with $4.8k. 
 

so it is affordable wat

$4.8K can do alot liao cos some people survive on $1.5k only.

Smoking hot HDB resale market presents opportune moment to upgrade or make a tidy profit. -myp
 

Mon, Apr 13, 2009

my paper
 

BY DARYLL NANAYAKARA
 

A FIVE-ROOM flat at Block 131B, Kim Tian Road, fetched a princely $658,000 on the resale market recently - more than what it may cost to get a private apartment in Loyang.
 

Over at Queenstown and Ghim Moh, the HDB resale market is similarly smoking hot: A five-room flat in Queenstown commanded $600,000 while another in Ghim Moh cost $650,000.
 

These flats are not short on amenities either: they are near food haunts, schools, MRT stations, swimming and sports complexes and a short ride from town.
 

As the price differentials between HDB flats and condominium apartments narrow, property companies told my paper that this is the best time for flat dwellers dreaming of an upgrade, or flat sellers hoping to make a tidy profit, to get in on the act.
 

While prices for private homes have plunged by 13.8 per cent in the first quarter this year, the price tags of resale HDB units have remained largely unaffected.
 

PropNex's corporate communications manager, Mr Adam Tan, said this was due to strong demand for resale flats.
 

He explained: 'The overall continued strong demand for resale flats stems from the fact that there are no more surplus flats with HDB and resale flats present a viable option for people who are unable to wait for projects under construction.'
 

So does this slump in the economy present an opportune moment to switch to private properties? The answer is a resounding yes.
 

'For people with the means, now is an excellent time...given that the gap between the price indices of the two is at its narrowest,' Mr Tan explained.

did i see "recession"? As far as i know, there's no recession in SG yet... VW sold 30 golfs in 1 wkend, each costing ave $80k, I was at the preview of MiCasa condo at CCK and pple were queuing to enter the showflat with 2 blks sold out on first 2 days, the same happened at Caspian over at Lakeview. 
 

but comes back to topic, recession or not, $730k for a HDB, even if it is in Chinatown, it's still silly to buy. I mean, how big is SG?? $730k can get a rather comfy condo at the above-mentioned developments, with swimming pool and security guards..

It is more adviseable to start small, start from HDB resale 3 rm flat ($200k+) enough for young couples & where near parent still can apply CPF housing grant $40k, after min. 5 yrs, slowly upgrading to HDB 4/5 rm flat if need more space. 
 

I rather stay Woodlands/Pasir Ris/Jurong West & drive a 1.6(A) Korean car then paying $722k for a DBSS cos it just a HDB flat w/o full condo feature.

The one at Bishan is named Natural because its only NATURAL that they can't sell at such prices  :D 



 

The bid for the Bishan was quite aggressive (ard 220+).  If you look at the first one (iircc), Tampines DBSS was 110+.
 

Now the developer at night cannot sleep.

Between this and sending parents to live in old age homes in JB, this might be the lesser of 2 evils?

Plus they get another avenue to loot the finances and chain one more anchor at your ankles.
 

This is so deja vu, like the EC scheme. No exit strategy.
 

Why buy a 700k+ property and then get restricted to a small target group when it is time to sell?
 

I rather buy a condo at that price and be able to sell it to a bigger market (including foreigners).

A popular foreign financial planner/advisor ever answered a question raised by someone:" Where you think is the best location to buy a flat in Singapore? Is it Bishan, Tampines or Ang Mo Kio". His answer is :
 

"Pick the cheapest HDB flat. Singapore is so small, everywhere is accessible. Save your money for retirement."

the 8k income ceilingz may seem low, but for those young marrried couple both graduates and combine income near 8k, they can easily afford it cos as they work longer, their income will definately increase over the years. 
 
 

the price may seem high, but lets not forget it is due to the good location eg. toa payoh, and the house comes with fittings so occupant can just move in, saving tens of thousand of renovation cost. pls there is the housing subsidy of 40k for young first timer ...

how the fark is a family earning "under $3k" a month gonna afford a $400k 3-room flat?
 

tempting people to under-declare their income?
 

retards... 
 

earning under 3k, i think best to spend under $200k for the home.

i think the issue here is not so much of the price, but the fact that there is a damn obviously unrealistic income cap.
 

then again, my friend who just bought a premium flat tells me that they don't enforce it strictly . racial quota also more lax, according to him.
 

practical la, otherwise they can't sell. but why not just scrap the income ceiling altogether? or change to 5-6k for 3-rm flat and 12k for 4 and 5 roomers? that's a bit more realistic, considering that even if i had 12k household income, i wouldn't consider the 5-room units.
 

but HDB is HDB. i never knew them to think for the commonfolk in all their policies and dealings

i just couldn't understand why people pay "exorbitant" price for a hdb flat. how many cases have been reported in the newspaper already ? and, how many online & newspaper discussion that said the price is too high and yet some say worth it / cheap leh / okay la -> good location ma. now it makes the impression that $600K for a hdb flat is really PEANUT ! anything lesser is worthless.

A popular foreign financial planner/advisor ever answered a question raised by someone:" Where you think is the best location to buy a flat in Singapore? Is it Bishan, Tampines or Ang Mo Kio". His answer is :
 

"Pick the cheapest HDB flat. Singapore is so small, everywhere is accessible. Save your money for retirement."
 

Regards,



 

Like it or not, it shows that the popular financial adviser knows nuts about property in Singapore.

The financial advisor spoke with a bit of vested interest.
 

Money otherwise spent on paying off mortgages could be spent on paying insurance premiums, which would had made the financial advisor richer.

30 years ago, 100K for HDB pigeon hole was unheard of.
 

30 - 40 years from now, maybe $700k for a 3 room pigeon hole would be a steal? Who knows? But of course, maybe 3 years from now the world might end, and it really don't matter.

Next Wednesday, The Peak @ Toa Payoh, boasting 1,203 units in two 42-storey blocks and three 40-storey blocks, will be launched.



 

1203 units only... that means only need to find 2406 roberts to buy, out of a population of 4 million. That's just 0.06015%. 
 

ok la... not hard to find. HDB  .

one word ''siao''...if i am willing to part with 700K....i can buy a actual condor.....for one i will not buy a resales if it is priced that way....



 

700K you can buy actual condor but have to take bank loan. Buy HDB can take HDB loan. Autual condor maintenance fee also higher than HDB and no rebate from gov. So long run can see alot $$ difference.

did i see "recession"? As far as i know, there's no recession in SG yet... VW sold 30 golfs in 1 wkend, each costing ave $80k, I was at the preview of MiCasa condo at CCK and pple were queuing to enter the showflat with 2 blks sold out on first 2 days, the same happened at Caspian over at Lakeview.



 

Base on my observation, i also feel that there is no recession gg on. Compare to the 1998 financial crisis, will know. Totally different. Dunno why. Imo maybe the rich and poor gap widen vso much to the pt that the rich get so rich that during recession they also dun care, juz spend on luxury as they can afford to, thats why we still can see many ppl buying ex items in this kind of difficult period while the poor all went hiding coz no money to go out and spend like the rich.

Last I heard City View has 40% unsold units... Bishan has another 30%... Considered good response?? 
 

Compared to those sold-out condos, these sales are nothing to shout about.  > 700K for 5rm???



 
 

and i still remember how they play with numbers by saying something like 70% of those launched are sold but they wont mentioned actually those launched are just 50% of total only...so, in fact, it's not 70% of total units but 70% of half of it...

haha actually you hit the nail on the head.not only that, and also coz out of those announced % sold,they are still subject to HDB's eligibility approval & also whether the buyers will exercise the option or not.eventually the no.of units actually sold will be a lesser %.

When you are talking about gross income not exceeding $8k, go you mean annual income (salary + bonus + allowance) / 12 months = <$8K or just your monthly basic income less than $8k? I always got confuse here.

IMHO, it is only garmen who is using the word "recession" lor.. 
 

Our economy, in a larger context, is still strong. 2 of our biggest sectors, financial and construction, are still doing pretty well. As far as I know, all banks (incl foreign), except UBS, still pays bonus for FY2008. Property and construction companies all hit record profits, and paying good bonus as well, for FY2008. Of course pple are buying big value items. 

As a matter of fact, I'm also on a lookout for a condo and hv been going house viewing every wkend.. The Peak is definitely too expensive for a HDB, however well located it may be. For $700k, one can get a condo unit in say, Bt Batok, Simei, Hougang etc, same size. Maintenance fees for these condo average $280/mth, so u compare to HDB, $65 S&C + $180 season parking if one has 2 cars.... almost the same liao. Moreover, condo got facilities and security. All this makes the HDB DBSS looks like a joke!!

don't know how hdb assess it
 

a. 9 to 5 employee with salary $4K. hence, combined income = $8K
 

b. car/property agent basic salary = $2K or less. but comission could be $10K to $20K to $50K varies heaven and earth depends on sales and market condition
 

c. sales agent who depends on comission
 




When you are talking about gross income not exceeding $8k, go you mean annual income (salary + bonus + allowance) / 12 months = <$8K or just your monthly basic income less than $8k? I always got confuse here.

Simei condo-style flats: No balloting
 

360 four- and five-room DBSS units can be booked on the spot. -ST
 

Fri, Apr 17, 2009

The Straits Times
 

By Joyce Teo
 

A NEW condo-style estate being launched by the Housing Board will allow buyers to secure a flat on the spot and not have to join a ballot like for other Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) projects.
 

Parc Lumiere at Simei Road will have 120 four-room flats and 240 five-room units. The four-roomers, of 1,012 sq ft each, are priced at between $378,000 and $425,000. The five-roomers range from 1,152 sq ft to 1,195 sq ft and are priced at between $462,000 and $575,000. The average price is $425 per sq ft (psf).
 

The walk-in selection sale starts with a viewing period from tomorrow for buyers to check out the showflats and enquire about eligibility. Booking on a first-come, first-served basis starts next Tuesday. The executive director of developer Sim Lian Group, Ms Diana Kuik, said the booking date may be brought forward if there is strong interest.

agree.there r still alot of transactions going on in the property market.especially if u have the $,best to invest in properties in those popular districts eg districts 9,10,11 when the price has dipped.when the market goes up,the value of properties in these districts shoots up first. 
 

i can't imagine if a HDB unit selling for over $700k now & in a few yrs' time when market picks up,will rise to nearly $1million.then the property market will be in a turmoil.

Thanks bro. Like that I think a person who hold a basic salary of less than $4k can still afford the flat if they were to pay by instalment. If it is total income divided by the number of months, then it will be a different calculation liao.

In all calculations and decisions in terms of buying properties, do not forget to weight the following well
 

"expected vs real"
 

Mortgage loan is real the moment you take it

Salary is expected and only becomes real when it hits your account and even if it does hit your account this month, it may not hit it in future months
 

People often just use the expected to cover the real.

I'm not saying it's wrong but do factor in another element which is the unexpected.
 

a sincere good luck to all who are looking for their first homes or upgrading.

Toa Payoh DBSS:

The smallest units - 95 of them - are the 753 sq ft three-room flats. They are priced from $355,000 to $398,000.

The 306 four-room flats of 980 sq ft will go for $468,000 to $582,000.

The next rung up the price ladder are the five-room flats, which mostly go for $539,000 to $698,000, and range from 1,184 sq ft to 1,259 sq ft.

The priciest of the lot are the 24 five-room high-ceiling flats costing between $700,000 and $722,000.
 

Simei DBSS: 

Parc Lumiere at Simei Road will have 120 four-room flats and 240 five-room units. The four-roomers, of 1,012 sq ft each, are priced at between $378,000 and $425,000.

Hold ur horses, it is monthly gross income. It will be better to get employer letter stating monthly gross. Payslip which states allowance will need a few month's copies to verify. 

Even for extended family if one of the tenant exceeds 8k u will not be eligible.

hmmm.... are these income cap just general guidelines or they strictly enforce it?
 

because I'm thinking of getting a 3rm flat, but the hdb selling price is higher then 5rm cos of the location. 

Using income cap to number of rooms doesnt make sense.

Think new and resale there's a difference. For new(direct) they will definately check. Speaking from expereince after getting 2 direct HDB. They do look at the average if one of ur month do exceed the cap.

Yes, calling up would be good. And they do deal with a case to case basis.

if a young couple combine income at 8k can easily afford the sibeh expensive flat.... they might as well buy a condom
 
 
 
 
 
 

...minium



 

The reason why we have a combined income of close to 8k but not being able to buy a condo because we can't afford the cash downpayment of 5%. We are a young couple who have worked for barely a couple years with not so much cash on hand so if we get a DBSS, the 5% option fee can be refunded from the CPF with the leftover in the CPF account after deduction for the stamp duty + the other 5% downpaymen + we get 30k grantt. If we get a condo, the cash downpayment has no option to get an reimursement from CPF and no grant.
 

A re-sale unit near my parents place in Tampines would cost 400+k to 500+k (20yrs old 5rm) + another 100k for major renovation to put it in nice shape, whereas I am paying 600k for a brand new unit in Bishan (more expensive district compard to the far east) with minimal renovation.
 

If you consider that home revo loan has got a shorter loan period, I will be paying more if not equal cash per month.

We are a young couple who have worked for barely a couple years with not so much cash on hand so if we get a DBSS, the 5% option fee can be refunded from the CPF with the leftover in the CPF account after deduction for the stamp duty + the other 5% downpaymen + we get 30k grantt. If we get a condo, the cash downpayment has no option to get an reimursement from CPF and no grant.
 

A re-sale unit near my parents place in Tampines would cost 400+k to 500+k (20yrs old 5rm) + another 100k for major renovation to put it in nice shape, whereas I am paying 600k for a brand new unit in Bishan (more expensive district compard to the far east) with minimal renovation.
 

If you consider that home revo loan has got a shorter loan period, I will be paying more if not equal cash per month.



 

Misconception: "+ we get 30k grantt"

Fo new flat, HDB do not give $30k grant cos it is considered as being subsidized.

DBSS applicants do get the housing grant of at least $30k, provided they have not purchased a resale flat previously and obtained a grant for that flat...

While I agree to ur statement. there is a "ownershipl" binding when using the stay near parent grant. The parent's house cannot be sold within 5 years.

No worry, me not buying. I am staying in a point blk 120sqm 5rm near TP bought at 400k+. I will not pay more for a smaller HDB 5 rm flat, think it is a bit ridiculous.  



 
 

I guess we will soon see a 1mil HDB (new) flat...

You get resale near ur Parents, u get $30+$10k=$40k more, even better.
 

Dun BS la..Tamp 5 room where got so expensive, if u check HDB past resale transaction.

Majority of the 5rms are selling at $300+, 20yr old flat will be much cheaper.There is no 5rm flats in tamp selling at 500+k. THe most exp i saw was a 12yr old 5rm at Blk 733, tamp st 71 sellin at 450k.Can check at HDB resale transaction.
 

Reno dun need 100k, unless u want Taj Mahal kinda house...$30k would suffice.

Wahaha you're funny,I LOL when I saw ur sentence "Reno dun need 100k, unless u want Taj Mahal kinda house". 
 

I think he estimated $100k because for new units,decent reno can be at $30k,but for resale you need to tear down everything to have a full major renovation & hence much more expensive,& the balance for furnitures probably.

700K you can buy actual condor but have to take bank loan. Buy HDB can take HDB loan. Autual condor maintenance fee also higher than HDB and no rebate from gov. So long run can see alot $$ difference.



 

My 99years 2 rooms and 1 study room condo (95 sq meters) cost $480k and maintenance fee monthly is $157. I have 2 cars and this is already cheaper than HDB carpark. It is a case of buying within your means and it may work out to be better than a HDB. With a almost done condo, reno is about $22k and it could have been cheaper if I did not shift a door and put in a new wardrobe and change some floor tiles. 99 years is not that bad when you are the 1st owner.
 

At the end of the day is not to over stretch your financial. I took up a loan that one person can pay monthly if either me or my wife is not working. Why get a 5 room or something big (if there are not a lot of people staying) and stretch the loan amount? This will cause sleepless night if one partner lose the job.
 

Btw, it is not easy to clean and keep a big house tidy if you don't have a maid.

From HDB:



Q:  	Can CPF monies be used for the full 20% downpayment for the purchase of Design, Build & Sell Scheme (DBSS) flats when signing the Sale and Purchase Agreement with the Developer?

[ Home Seekers > Buying An Apartment Under Design, Build And Sell Scheme > Financing and Conveyancing ]  
 

A: 	
 

For purchase of DBSS flats, buyers are required to pay an option fee equivalent to 5% of the purchase price in cheque/cashier

I was thinking like you earlier. Later when the little one came, plus other family changes, I was looking to move. Life is not so predictable afterall. Now my take is, if one can afford a bigger unit, then go for it.

100K for reno, would be the extreme end. 50K is abt there. One thing for sure that will be remove would be the toilet bowls!

SG govt dam cao kuan one lah. Every so called decent location is now DBSS. BTO only Bukit Panjang and Punggol.
 

They don't even provide an alternative to DBSS. For young couples at least, they've been waiting a long time to find some new flats near their parents.

Its bloody ironic that they encouraging strong family ties but yeah wtf, my son/daughter lives 1/2way across the island.
 

I want to get married in 2-3 yrs oso dunno wat i can afford.
 

HDB too exp at this current rate. wont qualify for 30k grant. Cant take HDB loan oso ...
 

On the other hand, FH condo will be really stretching finances at a period where money is tight. Sigh.

IMHO, it is only garmen who is using the word "recession" lor.. 
 

Our economy, in a larger context, is still strong. 2 of our biggest sectors, financial and construction, are still doing pretty well. As far as I know, all banks (incl foreign), except UBS, still pays bonus for FY2008. Property and construction companies all hit record profits, and paying good bonus as well, for FY2008.

When we got married and looking for house, we always thot spore small-small nia, public transport damn good, stupid to pay too much for house, got car can liao. Thats why get sembawang flat. 
 

Now with 2 kids.....suddenly everything changes.

oops... for my cases observed, typically the older generation (parents) don't like the idea of moving house.
 

within 5 years is perfectly okay i guess.
 

but yep it can be a limitation for some.

my sister used to think like him when she just got married.
 

chose yishun condo. parents staying in bedok. (similar to his case North and East)
 

within 3 years, move back to bedok resale.
 

Why? the power of small children  
 

once u have children, u want them to be able to visit ur parents regularly. Some even let their parents take care of their children momentarily till they reach 2 years old.

Yoz,
 

I've been to the showroom 2x over the weekend, really packed and there were alot of sign-ups. Personally I'm very interested in getting the 4rm at nearly 500k myself (with my gf). The 700k price tag did not seem to turn off too much buyers also.
 

Some of the members might have been laughing at how stupid I am. 500k might be possible to get a condo liao, y get a condo-lookalike HDB with condo-features?

Below were my considerations.
 

1. My parents also stay @Toa Payoh near central. Over the 20yrs, they have alot of frens and company, dun think I wanna pull them away from their "roots" if they are not willing. If I want any 4rm flat within 10min walking distance (my parents dun drive), I'll have to fork out at least 400k also. NTUC choices seems to be building a condo beside the peak. Can anyone guess the minimum price? If a 4-rm is also 500k, I'll be glad to sacrifice my 5% option fee and be the first in the queue. How I wish also my parents/frens stay at somewhere less central, then I can buy a big house at a cheap price like some of the earlier posters? So I hope you all can spare a thought for people like me who dun realli have much choices.
 

2. Location: Toa Payoh may be an older town, but becoz of presence of HDB hub and it's centralised location, it's labeled as a "premium" housing area. People who buy houses here are enjoying greater convenience of course, at an additional costs. Another side of the argument will claim that since SG is so small, live anywhere is the same. Try telling that to someone who has shifted from the less-central areas(eg. Pasir Ris, Jurong West,Admiralty) to Toa Payoh or the other way round. They are in the best position to tell you the difference, especially those who are not driving. However if your family & friends are all in your region, then the location considerations dun apply to you already.

But what if your family/relatives/frens are all in Toa Payoh, then there's a very strong argument in getting a unit in the same town.
 

Conclusion :  Dun think I'll sell the house in the next 10years or maybe even 20 years, unless I'm rich enuff to get a private condo "comfortably". So the pt of whether I can sell the unit for a profit or not, dun apply to me in this case as long as I maintain a stable job for the future. If I have to sweat it out in order to be near my parents/frens and to enjoy the locational benefits, this is my sacrifice.
 
 

Correct me if I'm wrong, I'd guess that the people who can afford a 600k++ 5rm are those 2nd time buyers who are expecting to make a good profit out of their current flat. If not, the 8k ceiling is quite ridiculous, unless u tio toto or big sweep or get inheritance. 
 

Overall, I think Singaporeans are not stupid here. If they are willing to part with 700k to buy a HDB when they could easily buy a private condo, they must have their reasons. Of coz there'll always be the rich family's sons/daughters. Not to forget the investors who ultimately play a major part in property market. Those who are rich, let them contribute to the economy lor.
 

If the developer fails to sell all the 700k units, then we can all laugh at them. 
 

Just my 2 cents...

Pay me money to live there and I will still have to think thrice.

This has been my opinion of toa payoh since i was a kid.
 

hope no one gets too sensitive and offended. 

just my own opinion, you have diff opinions and dont have to justify it.

Just put you rmoney where your mouth is.

If everybody think TPY best... then the buying price will not be a 6 digit liao anymore..

I stay in Pasir Ris, Jurong East and now Sembawang, and transit orchard mrt daily previous b4 our car came along, toa payoh is not that bad rah. Jurong East is a damn nightmare tho!!!!! 
 

Anyway, during weekends and weekdays peak hours.....everywhere also crowded mah, not much diff.  
 

Having said that, i wouldnt stay in TP, if not for my kids school + close proximity to me & wify workplace. Bcos of this double combo benefits, im willing to pay extra $$$$$ for a TP 5room. But its worth it lor.

The units in the tall blocks next to the church opp the MRT are ridiculously small.
 

Calling them a house is really an over-statement. My relatives live there and I feel so claustrophobic in it when visiting them on CNY.
 

Really reminds me of those 1-room flat with just better packaging.... :(

i would never ever pay 700k for a HDB. having said that i would count myself lucky that i got my 5rm punggol flat at 203k. It is rented out at 2k/mth currently. 2 mths ago i had and offer of 490k for my punggol unit. i was so tempted to sell. I really wanted to sell it and then go buy citi stocks. was about $1 then. then i looked at my wife when she was sleeping, and then it hit me like a lighting bolt. that i promise her that i would take care of her for the rest of my life. although my citi stock sot through the roof i did not regret my decision. I used to spent 1.5k buying 4D/mth n about 2k on soccer bets 4 years ago. I had been able to refrain from gambling for the past 4 years. 
 

Greed cause many men to fall flat on the ground. I had seen how one guy lost 3 million in a year due to share and gambling. i knew him personally quite close. Never ever gamble and i certainly doesn't agree with a young couple with a combine salary to buy a home for 700k. it is just crazy. If you r in your 30s quite stable wanting to upgrade pls go ahead. But not for first time buyers. You might as well sign your life away.
 

Anyway the number i followed for quite a number of years before i quit buying 4D came out 1st prise last weekend. My wife scream :"see your number finally came out!" I wasn't even excited, i told her that:"it doesn't matter to me, i dont feel the pain and my goal now is to pay off my hdb asap and buy 2 more condo to collect rent in old age"
 

Paying 700k for a HDB flat is not wise at all. How much u would have left in old age. In the future i foresee 60% of the population having at least a basic degree. So when u r old and expensive to ur company, u would be easily replace by a younger graduate.
 

You have one vote, pls for the sake of your future and your child vote wisely.

Believe me... there are even ppl pulling out at the first DBSS The Premiere @ Tampines.... Those who are interested should probably enquire at Sim Lian
 

I went to the Lumiere @ Simei and the prices are going for more than 120k of what Sim Lian offered at the Premiere... as for the showflats, i only liked the 5 room kitchen feature they are including which is the kitchen counter form ala restaurant style.... else they were using recycled materials such as the flooring, kitchen/shower taps and parquet finish.... 
 

But seeing the average reselling price for a 4 room flat in Simei, I can understand y this project attracts buyers so readily...

some young couple their joint income is 8k or near, and their income will likely increase as they work longer, so this makes it viable feasible for them to buy the hdb dbss at 700k. not to forget these are likely to enjoy some rebate from hdb.

if u buy 700k DBSS flat, who is your resale mkt?
 

even if u think u are never ever going to shift out. 

never rule that out. always leave an exit door.
 

it may be possible during the older generation's era to stay their entire life in the same flat. 
 

future generations have to factor in the possibility that there may come a day they need to monetise a fully paid home and shift to a smaller flat to extract money for old age.
 

unless dbss becomes the norm, it will be a repeat of the EC saga.

bro, so vote for the lightning or hammer or?



 

I voted before at the last erection, before i could think my hand draw the cross for me already. Only i know where i put my cross. For my future and for my future child. I don't want them to pay for a $1mil home in the future. I really feel sad the those who cant afford a home and for those first time buyer who paid 500-700k for a HDB flat. My friend paid 500k for a brand new 4rm AMK flat 1.5 years ago, although it is the top storey and high ceilling. I think he is having second thoughts now.

i also live in toa payoh, and i also feel paying $700k for a flat is crazy...... getting into trouble
 

the worst thing is that the PEAK will have 1000 over units!!!  this is madess.... is it mass orgy? 
 

the whole damm place will have tons of ppl and cars and no privacy at all. 
 

i rather buy a condo with alot more privacy and lesser neighbors with $700k.



 

I agree with u, there are many  units along the east coast road area with that selling price now. Freehold, more privacy, pool, security. I wonder with 1000 units packed into such a small area can one find parking space in the multi-storey carpark? Or will it be like "Sea floor find needle" kind of situation after a hard day at work.

well, living in toa payoh has its advantages... other than overcrowding like tampines ~ 
 

i am going to have mass orgy with 1800 households at duxton..... 
 

cost me almost half a mil
 

-,- at least i can walk home next time, no need to orgy like sardines in the train... i expect more crowd with the future opening of the 2 entertainment centres in sentosa and marina

I guess for those that bought a DBSS flat would think that the price they paid is already the "floor price" and hence the value of their flats will only appreciate since there is no way anyone will sell their unit for anything less than what they had paid the "developer"..... This is typically the case when it comes to buying new flats from HDB and selling them onto the secondary market later.. 
 

However the true capital appreciation for DBSS flats have yet been established and it will be interesting when the time comes, how will the bank value such DBSS units. If the bank valuer does not recognise the "developer's price" and value it lower than the original purchase price,  then we will have a very interesting situation....

I guess the main draw is that you get a "condo style" development with all the regular hdb grants and such which can come up to quite significant $$$ (it's as good as govt giving a discount) .... Otherwise if you were to buy a private property, you got to cough up that bit through your own pocket (either in terms of cash or cpf).... And DBSS tend to be in pretty good location too.....

Great view (High floor)

Good location (near PIE and town)

Premium Design (Condo style)

Fully renovated 

Apartment name sounds very prestige (my HDB no name only got blk #)
 

Resale HDB flat at good location also selling at 500-600k, its actually just 100+k diff
 

30 yrs loan , every month also need 2000+?

The "problem" with DBSS is that they are technically HDB flats but they come with better fittings and being classified as hdb flats brings with it selling restrictions.
 

If you have been following this thread, some have queried if DBSS is worth that price. Why not a 99 yr condo with full facilities etc... Theses are the same set of questions a prospective buyer will ask himself when viewing a resale DBSS. 
 

A very near substitute for the DBS would be the Executive Apartment. Demand for EA compared to 4/5 room not so strong.

the 8k income ceilingz may seem low, but for those young marrried couple both graduates and combine income near 8k, they can easily afford it cos as they work longer, their income will definately increase over the years. 
 
 

the price may seem high, but lets not forget it is due to the good location eg. toa payoh, and the house comes with fittings so occupant can just move in, saving tens of thousand of renovation cost. pls there is the housing subsidy of 40k for young first timer ...




Friend... Don't assume what you get now, you will get more later. Also, there's no such thing as job security. Then there's also, what if the couple later on decide to have a family? Expense will grow.

ehhh Bro, valuation/valuer is closely related to HBD leh..... if the HDB want the program to succeed, you bet the valuation few years down the road will be "attractive".... but of course if HDB got "new pattern" "new mehtod" to earn $$$, then the valuation of this DBSS thingy few year down the road will also be very attractive..... attractively low that is....

Reserve reserve reserve in the end nobody wants (or chinese quota full) and end up releasing to markets as walk in selection. It benefits some but hinder the those who genuinely wanted a flat "fast"...

May I add on:
 

Based on the CPF contribution ceiling, the max contribution to CPF ordinary account is about $1035 only per person. For couple, they have to top it up with cash of about $500 per month. 
 

In addition, when a person reaches 35yr and above, the % of CPF contribution going into CPF ordinary account will decrease from the current 67% (Total  CPF contribution of Employer + Employee ) to 60% and eventually to about 45% at age 50. Hence every month you have to top up with more cold hard cash to your mortgage loan as you age. 
 

By then you would curse and swear. Of course the assumption is only true if you loan 90% and stay at the same house till 50 yers old.

Contribution is reduced to Ordinary Account once you are past 35, and more goes to Special account and Medisave.
 

Personally, I feel that for first time buyers, the price is too expensive unless they have strong backings to decrease the loan amount. This will mean people will spend all their time slogging like crazy and no time to think about other things like politics? 
 

It is strange that income ceiling has not changed for many years, maybe it is there to spread out wealth, just my thoughts.

There's always 2 different train of thoughts. Else property prices can only go in one direction. Only time can tell... it will move up and down, but I believe (in Sgp context) the value will be likely be on the upside in a decade and after. $$ depreciate over yrs. 
 

If one can afford and live happily there, what's the problem paying for this DBSS to enjoy?

When you are talking about gross income not exceeding $8k, go you mean annual income (salary + bonus + allowance) / 12 months = <$8K or just your monthly basic income less than $8k? I always got confuse here. 



 
 

Doesn't matter. 

Gross $8k, minus CPF, your take home is only $6400. With a gross income ceiling of $8k, no one can afford a $722k flat unless they can put down 50% downpayment. Even with a 50% downpayment, monthly instalment for a 25 year HDB loan should be close to $2k. 
 

Sanity check, how many people can fork out $360k cash downpayment (or in their CPF account)?
 

If you were to buy it at 10% downpayment, nearly your take home pay will go to the house instalment.
 

This esitmation is not taking monthly CPF contribution into consideration.
 

The pricing is just crazy, and the policies are making it worse, coupled with the high cost of car ownership and living.... 
 

I've bought a condo with a $500k loan and the monthly instalments can really kill. End up sell the condo, buy a 3 room flat and be loan free

many of the criticism throw at buyers of the toa payoh hdb dbss are flawed.  altho the selling price is high, properties are proven to hold their value, especially public ones (i.e. not private condo ).  so long after the purchase when one decides to sell it, it is likely it will fetch at least the original price, if not a hefty profit. why should the toa payoh dbss be different ? 
 

for young couples with an 8k income, by the time they work for another 5 to 10 years, their income may easily be double or few times more, so the monthly instalment is not an issue. of cos no one is guaranteed of conitnued employment, but that is beside the point. else might as well say cannot buy anything by instalment at all. e.g. car or any housing for that matter.
 

some say the price is crazy, but the 80% take up rate cannot be stupid buyers or wrong. it is a matter of affordability. these people would have worked their sums and they can afford it. it is like chiding why some people will buy a japanese made lexus at $200k instead of a conti premium make. well, they can afford it, and they like it. to someone who are not in the same league of finance, it will appear irrational to them.
 

my friend works in a bank, she tells me that according to bank balances, singapore has many many people with millionsof dollars sitting in a single bank account, not to mention how many different bank accounts they have. so to these people, it is nothing.

They may feel that they will not forever earn the same level of salary, in future, they will get promoted, pay will increase, bonus will increase, this in turn make them able to pay the loan. Furthermore, such an ex flat, they will be motivated and hungry to climb up corporate ladder to earn more money to finance the loan which in turn this motivation will also improve their standard of living. This is what i read from a duxton forum, some duxton buyer defend and stated why they want to purchase the flat even though its so ex.

Most ppl would move house a few times for one reason or another. For me, i have move 6 times and this end May will be the 7th & hopefully the last. Quite a lot for a 30+ person.
 

Circuit Road(infant till 3yr) --> Kim Keat Ave(3yr till 20+) --> Pasir Ris(a few years) --> Jurong East(mostly weekend at GF house now wify liao   ) --> Sembawang(2000 to now). Next month will be moving to TP.
 

Having stay in so many places, staying centralise location is still the best. If i would to choose again where to stay, i'll rather get a damn good central area and not move anymore. PEAK will be a good choice, despite the high pricetag.

That's very true... during my wedding, wanted a simple buffet with close family and friends, why waste $$$ hold dinner and invite those fella whom you neber met in your entire life...... but, kena fark upside down, rightside up, left, right, centre, top, bottom....

holding wedding dinners is only for parents' sake.  the dinner is not for you actually.  its for your parents' face that you can afford to throw a grand wedding dinner. 
 

the wedding couple is just a calefare

i married my wife and had paid evrything from house to raising kids to expenses everything by ourselves. while we really dont want to hold wedding dinner due to the cost and the time and effort, my in laws who are doing business insisted that we have a wedding dinner even though our marriage was already long known among friends and relatives, but in the end we lan lan have to do it. the time and money could have been put to better use like education and renovation.

So your wedding dinner has the hidden objective of social and business networking.

i think my in laws insisted on the wedding dinner ceremony because they are traditional and they feel that if marry their daughter out, should have a formal ceremony then is considered appropriate. else people especially those old generation will ask sensitive questions like why we never have wedding dinner, is their daughter married or not and if yes then why never had dinner, and such stupid questions. in the end, it is still all about face.

What u say is true. In future i worry it will turn into a social problem like what the American is experiencing. Should change current mindset of "borrow and spend" to "invest and save". Feel its better this way



 

Your investments will only grow when there are people who have the mindset "borrow and spend". If everyone just thinks of saving, then the whole economy will stall, need not talk about investments.

Not true that parents have the final say. A lot depend on how much the couple want to control on how they want their wedding to be.

I married for 7yrs already, but still yet to hold my traditional dinner. My in laws expect it a few years ago but now i think they gave up already.

Lucky my wife doesnt mind, i would like to take wedding photo ask her to shop around for good photographer but till now she still cant be bothered to look for one.
 

Last time my excuse was that i buy a house first, house more impt ithink my in laws bought the idea.
 

so any of u want to skip the hassel can use my excuse

The root of the problem is "Face". Especially the chinese race.
 

Expensive wedding + flashy car + nice condo + socialite functions = face. Period.
 

Pocket no money die die also must look rich. Maxed out credit cards also must look rich.
 

I know many will flack me but I will still stand by what I say.



 

I agree with you pledging both my hands and legs.

dun think there is anything to flack... to each their own.....
 
 

i getting married too... to my parents and me a church wedding is most important, the dinner after that is secondary. Even OC says it is up to me...... to hold a dinner after that or not.... after some consideration..... i decided to hold 1... the reason is pretty simple, my OC and i was brought up by our parents, it is a joyous occasion that they should share with their friends, to see their children getting married. it is a form of respect and appreciation to them.....
 

the wedding is definitely for them rather than us.... but after raising us up for so many years what is wrong in spending abit more to make them feel proud.......
 

to put things into perspective, when people pass away, why is there a need for funeral wake? Just go cremate lor..... alot people will say, it is to pay last respects, etc.... well... i dun think so... i think it is to show that they are fillal, in other words, FACE.....
 

Everybody want face, difference is only how much.... isn't that the same reason why 1 do up their car? Like how you do up your vios, etc.. to stand out, to be different, to have face.... hope no offence taken, just that i feel when people find 1 thing is useless they find different excuses to escape from it but when 1 find it benefical, they will find 101 excuses to do it..
 

Mother or Wife important?
 

I refer you to the above thread for reference and my post #43 in retort to those that chose mother rather than wife. most trying to show they are fillal by choosing mother.
 

I think i gonna get flack for it too....

Those who can earn a lot more in 5 to 10 years time will hop over and buy the Arte. Freehold plus it is about at least 200K more only, which is a much better investment.  Most of those that I know who made it have bought private properties right from the start.
 

     And private properties are proven to hold their values better than hdb.  In the end, there is no definite wrong or right, it's a matter of perspective that we looking from.  
 
 




many of the criticism throw at buyers of the toa payoh hdb dbss are flawed.  altho the selling price is high, properties are proven to hold their value, especially public ones (i.e. not private condo ).  so long after the purchase when one decides to sell it, it is likely it will fetch at least the original price, if not a hefty profit. why should the toa payoh dbss be different ? 
 

for young couples with an 8k income, by the time they work for another 5 to 10 years, their income may easily be double or few times more, so the monthly instalment is not an issue. of cos no one is guaranteed of conitnued employment, but that is beside the point. else might as well say cannot buy anything by instalment at all. e.g. car or any housing for that matter.
 

some say the price is crazy, but the 80% take up rate cannot be stupid buyers or wrong. it is a matter of affordability. these people would have worked their sums and they can afford it. it is like chiding why some people will buy a japanese made lexus at $200k instead of a conti premium make. well, they can afford it, and they like it. to someone who are not in the same league of finance, it will appear irrational to them.
 

my friend works in a bank, she tells me that according to bank balances, singapore has many many people with millionsof dollars sitting in a single bank account, not to mention how many different bank accounts they have. so to these people, it is nothing.

In that case, can have Indian Rojak dinner buffet whole week long. 1st nite cannot finish then left over till 2nd nite and so on. 
 

Just make sure to keep on frying them everyday. By the last nite, the rojak should be super-duper crispy liao.

the Arte cost 1.5 to 2million each unit, and most are near 2million, not just 200k above the 700k selling price of DBSS.
 

also, for young couples (like one 1 know both of whom are early twenties and grad from nus and worked for 2 years, they applied for the amk ave 5 dbss but rejected due to income exceed ceiling ), their income may be just almost breaching 8k, so it is not feasible for them to buy the Arte or any freehold premium property now, so the next best thing is a DBSS with good location and private housing fitting.  A 2mil Arte will be out of reach for them now.

A 2 bedder in The Arte is around 1059sqft which will work out to be slightly above $1mill... For young couples that just started working, coughing up the 5% cash ($50K+) may already be a problem.... what's more, they need another $150k+ in CPF once they take delivery of their unit...  And this is not factoring the stamp duty and other charges.... With the monthly CPF cap, the couple will need to have worked for at least 5~6 years before they amass enough CPF to buy a $1mil property..... Not entirely un-doable but it takes discipline and a lot of determination.... and meaning to say they can only start their family in their late twenties.... 
 

The scary thing is that if new HDB flats reaches the $1mil mark, then the above scenario becomes the norm for all...

Hrrrrrr........half my office ppl stay in either condo or FH. FULLY paid liao. And they are not scholers or graduates.....far from it. DBSS "The Peak" price is really nothing despite all the hoo-ahh on affordability. Its actually a downgrade for some.

New showflats pull in crowds
 

Condo-style flats popular; private homes see encouraging sales. -ST

The Straits Times
 

By Joyce Teo, Property Correspondent
 

THOUSANDS of people flocked to check out some of the new housing developments on sale over the weekend, scenes more reminiscent of a boom, not a recession.
 

As one industry watcher told The Straits Times: 'The mass market is still moving. If you price it correctly and reasonably, people will still buy.'
 

The hottest ticket in town was clearly the Parc Lumiere project, which drew an astonishing 6,500 visitors over the weekend.
 

Buyers had begun queueing last Friday before its viewing period started on Saturday, with 829 people eventually in the line for flats in the estate, which is being developed under the Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS).
 

There was no balloting for the project: Just turn up and book.
 

Developer Sim Lian Group said it has already sold 306 units out of a total of 360. All the four-room flats, priced between $378,000 and $425,000, have been sold.
 

Only the low-floor five-room flats are left. The five-roomers are priced from $462,000 to $575,000.
 

'After going through Premiere @ Tampines, we thought we would try another way of selling. When you do it by ballot, a lot of people just try for fun. A lot who were keen didn't get the chance to book,' said Sim Lian executive director Diana Kuik.
 

But some potential buyers felt the walk-in selection sale method, essentially a first-come, first-served sale, was inconvenient. One said the sale came at too short a notice for him to take leave to queue. A parent said her son had been waiting for the project but was travelling in Europe.
 

Sim Lian said it has had feedback from happy buyers, including a pair of siblings happy to get a unit next to each other.



The second DBSS project, The Peak @ Toa Payoh, also had a busy weekend with 1,711 applications lodged as of 6pm yesterday for the 1,203 units. (So few people applied?)  
 

This project by developer Hoi Hup Sunway is being sold by ballot, with applications open until next Tuesday.
 

About 22,500 people had visited the showflat from last Wednesday until it closed yesterday, said Ms Kellie Liew, executive director of projects at HSR Property Group, the marketing agent for The Peak. More than half of the applicants are interested in the five-room flats, with about 30 per cent looking at the four-roomers, she said.
 

In the private home market, the freehold The Arte in Jalan Datoh attracted about 1,000 people over the weekend, said developer City Developments (CDL).
 

The average price at the 336-unit project - which boasts relatively large flats - is $880 psf, with most units going for under $2 million each.
 

CDL said it sold another 20 units over the weekend for $30 million, bringing total sales to 170.
 

'The sales volume indicates that buyers have greater confidence in the property market and in the future of their investment,' said CDL group general manager Chia Ngiang Hong.
 

'This reinforces CDL's view that the current market is now attracting savvy but cautious investors.'
 

A large number of buyers have private home addresses, he said, with many saying they want to invest in another property or to move into a 'new and upscale residence'. CDL said it has extended the interest absorption scheme to these buyers.
 

Two other large projects that were launched last month also saw encouraging sales.
 

A further 22 apartments were sold at the 457-unit Mi Casa condominium in Choa Chu Kang in the past week, bringing total sales to 202 units. Prices hovered around $635 psf.
 

More than half of the 646 units at Double Bay Residences in Simei have been sold. This was the best-selling project last month, with 264 units being bought.
 

About 60 per cent of the 68-unit Verdure in Holland Roadhas also been sold since its preview more than a week ago.

ideally of course.
 

however, if funeral never attend, then people will say that "when deceased is alive, never visit.  Now that deceased is dead, also never pay final respect - what kind of unfeeling creature is that???".
 

thus, on the positive side, AT LEAST they come to pay final respect.

Right. HDB supply (or the lack of it now) is providing the floor for private.

If not, the price for heartland condo will revisit 97 pricing.
 

But the timing of your first home purchase is crucial. It can be the springboard or the proverbial anchor when it comes to the next property.
 

But it is difficult for newly married couples. The key thing is to get a home asap. That kind of conflicts with timing your entry. ask those married couple who married in late 90s before 97 about their property experience.

I tink for most of the young couples taking up DBSS. This is their similar experience. Think it will be my experience soon  
 

BTO has really choked off any supply of HDB flats.

Hmm ... not practical. Majority of those who passes on are in a situation where visitors are not possible or conceivable. Eg. accidental death, sudden death. Even for those deathbed situation, those moments are reserved for very close ones.

I do hear horror stories from owners that were too quick to plunge into the market during the pre-97 era...
 

Back in 2003 when I was shopping for a flat, there was a particular unit that I really like. Owner was asking for $30k COV which was crazy at that time because everyone else were selling below valuation... Negotiated like crazy but for the very last offer, owner still wants $15k COV. I asked why his unit selling so high and he told me that he paid more than $700k for his unit during the peak....  
 

Anyway I refused to bite and managed to find a similar unit on a lower floor selling at $20k below valuation. 5 years later when i sold off my unit, the owner upstairs is still having a hard time trying to sell his place because although we experienced another boom, the valuation was nowhere close to the $700k that he paid previously.

U got a DBSS or looking around for a flat? I do not envy your situation because back in 2003 when I was looking around, there was a glut because HDB built too many flats... I was spoilt for choice. But then again, the economy also very jialat because a lot of these contractors that were building HDB flats also went bust because of cash flow problems. So HDB kena stuck with unsold flats plus uncompleted projects.. double whammy... 
 

I remember the take-up rate for Cantonment was really poor although it's so close to the city....

My sister oredi move to TP 3 years ago. Its 2 blocks away from my soon-to-be-new house. During that time COV 100k to 150k is a norm.
 

She even got a excel sheet to compile the price list, condition of house details, estimate reno costs....blah blah blah. COV 50k, 80k, 100k, 150k for 5 room flats is common. Finally she settle on a 4-room mid-floor unit, transact @ 430k. COV 30k. Condition of house so-so only.  That was consider the mother of all super deals.....during that time. Step on cow dung kind of deal.  
 

Now i do even better than her.....top 25th floor 5room flat, 122 sqm corner unit, COV 12k, trans @ 562k. Not too bad rah...considering the excellent condition of the house + unblock view of the city.   
 

The strange thing is........even in this bad ecomony, the valuation is still increasing. Most of the house i shortlist, valuation increase average 10k to 20k. That was only a mere 2 months ago nia.

Valuation will lag the market by at least 3 months (the time taken for sales to be completed), which only highlights the severe inadequacy of the system. Where are the scholars when u need them??

actually valuation is not that laggy.
 

i used to think that it was the case until hhh inform me that his sale price is already in the hdb website and his sale was one month ago.
 

so the valuers are working with whatever current data they have access to.
 

what do you suggest instead? (not meant as a taunt but looking for your feedback).

i used to think that it was the case until hhh inform me that his sale price is already in the hdb website and his sale was one month ago.
 

so the valuers are working with whatever current data they have access to.
 

what do you suggest instead? (not meant as a taunt but looking for your feedback).



 

From HDB website:

The data is based on approved resale applications and is updated on the 1st and 16th of each month.
 

I remember someone told me the data will be reflected on HDB resale transaction website after maybe 1st appointment. They used to be included after the sales completed.

not trying to compare but i got my TP 5 roomer (which is directly in front of the peak) 

at 448k 3 yrs back on the 28th floor with marble flooring, nicely done corner unit size is 116sqm

valuation was 472k but managed to squeeze the seller to let me have it at 448k.

now dunno whether to sell or not, as the transacted price for similar unit is going at around 650k.

i have to say, TP is really a convenient place. 
 
 
 
 
 




My sister oredi move to TP 3 years ago. Its 2 blocks away from my soon-to-be-new house. During that time COV 100k to 150k is a norm.
 

She even got a excel sheet to compile the price list, condition of house details, estimate reno costs....blah blah blah. COV 50k, 80k, 100k, 150k for 5 room flats is common. Finally she settle on a 4-room mid-floor unit, transact @ 430k. COV 30k. Condition of house so-so only.  That was consider the mother of all super deals.....during that time. Step on cow dung kind of deal.  
 

Now i do even better than her.....top 25th floor 5room flat, 122 sqm corner unit, COV 12k, trans @ 562k. Not too bad rah...considering the excellent condition of the house + unblock view of the city.   
 

The strange thing is........even in this bad ecomony, the valuation is still increasing. Most of the house i shortlist, valuation increase average 10k to 20k. That was only a mere 2 months ago nia.

take up rate & subscription rate is 2 different thing. to subscribe, you only need to pay $10 to get a chance to choose the flat while take up rate, you need to pay a 10% deposit of the selling price.
 

cantonment is definitely over subscribed during its launch but the take up rate is not 100% due to the fact that not many ppl at that time want to pay so much and yet get the leftover units. but thinking back, i think those who forgo their chance to take up the unit in 2004 could be regretting now.

Oic.... I was refering to take-up rate because at that time, I always drive pass cantonment at night and see many empty unlit units... took many years before it was fully occupied....

For 2 bedder, the quoted price is around what I've said. 
 
 




the Arte cost 1.5 to 2million each unit, and most are near 2million, not just 200k above the 700k selling price of DBSS.
 

also, for young couples (like one 1 know both of whom are early twenties and grad from nus and worked for 2 years, they applied for the amk ave 5 dbss but rejected due to income exceed ceiling ), their income may be just almost breaching 8k, so it is not feasible for them to buy the Arte or any freehold premium property now, so the next best thing is a DBSS with good location and private housing fitting.  A 2mil Arte will be out of reach for them now.

I grew up in the nearby kim keat ave blk 194/3room which is still there. So its a kindof "return home" kindof feeling. Feels very very good to be back. After moving house for 6 times, probably wont be moving anymore.

I think there is one thing that everyone is forgetting here, keep selling and selling making some profits, keep pumping up the prices. By the time our children wants to buy a flat, how much do you think the flat would cost and how much are the average of their generation going to earn?? Good question for everyone to think about now...

Ya...ur spot on. Good observations.  
 

I shortlist 2 other units at blk 48 & blk 7 nearby before deciding on this one. Its less cramp than other block clusters. A nice playground downstairs. My sis stay in blk 35 and was told the CC is very active there. Always got functions, gatherings and even setup free movies for residents often. A good place for a family to live in. 
 

Btw, i heard from a few sources, those empty old blocks directly across the road are not going to be torn down ? They are considering refurnishing to accommodate the youth Olypmics personnel and thereafter into studio apartments for the elderly ? Duno how true it is.

all profits made will go to helping their children pay for their new flats new time...
 

its just virutal money rolling around..... in the end, only HDB, Banks and housing agents will be the real winner..
 
 

i just feel its really irresponsible speculating on HDB flats. Buyers and sellers alike..
 

We all complain about the mess HDB made. But to see part of the problem, we just need to take a look in the mirror.

U got a DBSS or looking around for a flat? I do not envy your situation because back in 2003 when I was looking around, there was a glut because HDB built too many flats... I was spoilt for choice. But then again, the economy also very jialat because a lot of these contractors that were building HDB flats also went bust because of cash flow problems. So HDB kena stuck with unsold flats plus uncompleted projects.. double whammy... 
 

I remember the take-up rate for Cantonment was really poor although it's so close to the city....  



 

Nope. i havent started looking. But i will in abt 1-2 yrs time.
 

But its really a worry. I hope resale flats prices r more realistic then. I want to stay in Clementi cos i live there now n my OC's workplace in west coast. 

Not much choices here though, my OC not keen on old flats  
 

ya the times of ready selection of hdb flats r gone

I tink for most of the young couples taking up DBSS. This is their similar experience. Think it will be my experience soon  
 

BTO has really choked off any supply of HDB flats.



 

You gg for DBSS? if u have some time, why not wait for BTO is decent locations? 

BTO will be more frequent now and hopefully priced lower.

Compared to the pre-97 days, HDB prices nowadays are considered relatively realistic already..... 
 

My ex-neighbor paid more than $700k for a HDB Mansionette during pre-97 days and in 2003, I only paid $400K+ for mine..... And even during the 2007~2008 boom times, our valuation was no where near the $700k mark and eventually when I sold my unit in 2008, I only got $5XXk and the value has been hovering around that level since (despite the fact that there's a "recession" going on)....
 

I thought I will be seeing prices at those 2002 ~ 2003 levels but after waiting more than a year since the sub-prime fiasco, HDB prices are still holding strong.... 
 

I would think the Govt would have learn their lessons from '97 and not let the HDB bubble build up but yet they allow the DBSS developers to ask $722k for a new flat strikes me as a very odd move.....

Got this from Zaobao:
 

2007年，我们迎来了1万7000名新公民和6万4000名永久居民，2008年，新公民2万名，新永久居民8万名，与2000年比较，激增了两倍。在短短两年的时间里，新加坡共吸引了18万1000名新移民，
 

Translate: In 2007, Singapore have 17000 new citizens and 64,000 new PRs. In 2008, we have 20,000 new citizens and 80,000 new PRs.
 

With so many new citizens and new PRs every year, and without any leftover surplus HDB units as in 2002-2004, do you think HDB price will drop?

anyway BTO is ridiculous. i know the construction takes time. Town planning etc, infrastructure etc.

I understand the need to build to order BUT anything >3 yrs really is detrimental to family planning.
 

Unless u r in your early 20s or what and have lot of time to wait b4 settling down, its really way too long lo.

Late 20s or earli 30s, wait 4 yo for BTO. completely unrealistic lah.

Simei DBSS only need like 2 years to build, why HDB need so long?
 

Also, I notice their construction time is taking longer and longer, some even need 4 years leh.

very subjective in today's climate. it may face sea, greenery, and certainly face recession.

buy the cheapest, risk is lowest.

in the 80s flat cost $25-30k for a 3 rm flat. HDB did not make so much $$, why bother to

build more.

Premium for HDB resale flats in sharp fall
 

Median cash-over-valuation for resale transactions plunges 73% in Q1
 

By EMILYN YAP
 
 

BUYERS are increasingly reluctant to pay a premium for HDB flats, going by fast-falling cash-over-valuation (COV) figures from the Housing & Development Board yesterday. The median COV for resale transactions dived a stunning 73 per cent from $15,000 in Q4 2008 to $4,000 in Q1 2009.
 

In fact, the median COVs for five-room and executive flats were both zero dollars in Q1 2009. Just a quarter ago, buyers paid median cash amounts of $11,000 and $12,000 on top of valuation for five-room and executive flats respectively.
 

'The sharp drop in COVs is due to increasing public resistance to paying above what are already higher valuations,' said PropNex chief executive officer Mohamed Ismail.
 

According to HDB, the proportion of flats that changed hands above valuation fell in Q1 2009 to 62 per cent of all resale transactions, from 85 per cent in Q4 2008.
 

ERA Asia-Pacific noted that more higher-value HDB resale flats are being sold below valuation - for $30,000 to $50,000 less in some cases. 'In coming quarters, we are likely to see more and more larger flats sold at or below valuation as the harsh economic conditions hit home,' said ERA associate director Eugene Lim.
 

Stricter loan-to-value ratios could have contributed to the trend. 'Banks are becoming more conservative and there have been cases where buyers are offered only 70 per cent loans instead of the usual 80 per cent,' Mr Lim said.
 

The cooling economy has also turned some home-seekers away from five-room to four-room flats, he noted. And as a result, prices of larger flats may face downward pressure.
 

On the whole, HDB's resale price index slid 0.8 per cent in Q1 2009 from Q4 2008, shrinking more than the flash estimate of minus 0.6 per cent released early this month. This is the first time the index has shrunk after growing more than 30 per cent over nine straight quarters.
 

Property consultants expect resale HDB flat prices to drop 5-10 per cent for the whole year, with larger flats accounting for more of the fall.
 

Nevertheless, 'we do not expect the decrease in HDB resale prices to dent upgrader demand for private property, because the rate of price fall of HDB resale flats is still smaller than that of private homes,' said Knight Frank's director of consultancy & research Nicholas Mak.
 

Three to four-room flats should enjoy greater demand, consultants reckon. As PropNex's Mr Mohamed observed, buyers are still willing to pay COV for these flats.
 

HDB data also shows a rising proportion of resale flat applications involving smaller flats.
 

Three- and four-room flats accounted for 69.8 per cent of applications in Q1 2009, compared with 67 per cent in Q4 2008.
 

There were 6,446 resale transactions in Q1 2009, 4.2 per cent more than in the preceding quarter. 'HDB resale transactions typically increase when times are bad,' said ERA's Mr Lim.
 

But with HDB building more new flats, some demand may shift, he added.
 

HDB said yesterday that it plans to launch another 2,400 build-to-order flats over the next six months, of which about 1,000 will be three-room and smaller flats.

The problem is valuation increases by a lot, hence lesser COV does not really mean very low price.

Those haolian developers advertise in papers saying all their units sold out within how many weeks of the launch but in actual fact, two weeks later a lot of buyers return their units as they cannot exercise their option because the banks cannot match the value to their asking and the buyer don't want to top up cash.... No wonder the develoepers are pissed....

Developers meet valuers in search for common ground
 

Finger pointed at banks as some buyers struggle to raise enough loans
 

By KALPANA RASHIWALA
 
 

(SINGAPORE) Developers last week held a meeting with valuers amid recent complaints in some quarters that conservative valuations have derailed some home sale deals as potential buyers could not secure the required loan quantum from banks.
 

BT understands that the valuers disagreed with the developers that their valuations had been too conservative, and that it was the banks that were just not lending.
 

'Generally, if there are transactions, we'll match (with valuations). It's the banks that are more cautious about lending to certain profiles of borrowers like investors, especially if they are foreigners,' a valuer told BT.
 

The valuers also raised issues that they had been facing in recent months, such as a dearth of comparable transactions, and explained the methods that they use to arrive at valuations in such situations.
 

'We explained that some banks require valuers to look at three comparable transactions, and how we generally do not take into account outlier transactions that may perhaps reflect 'depressed' prices,' another valuer said.
 

Sources say that the meeting was amicable, drawing more than 20 valuers and heads of property consulting groups and the executive committee members of the Real Estate Developers Association of Singapore led by its president, Simon Cheong.
 

When contacted, a Redas spokesman said: 'We wanted to better understand issues that valuers may have in their day-to-day valuation and what else the profession may need from developers to enable them to give (as) updated and relevant (a) valuation as possible.
 

'The discussions were general in nature and discrepancies in valuations in some instances were highlighted and analysed. Valuers shared with us some of the constraints they are facing such as the lack of or insufficient comparable sales data and other issues.
 

'The session was fruitful as it helped us understand one another better and we agreed to look into areas where communication and interaction could be improved upon.'
 

A property consultant told BT that he found it odd that the same banks that were willing to give a 75 per cent or 80 per cent loan on a high-end residential unit when it was priced at $2,000 psf (thus assuming an exposure for about $1,500 to $1,600 psf) are now reluctant to give even 50 or 60 per cent loan when the property is going for a much lower price of $1,200 psf (which works out to $600-720 psf exposure for the bank).
 

'It's particularly difficult for foreign buyers, even PRs in some instances, to get loans for investment properties. Banks are more willing to lend to Singaporeans buying residential properties for owner occupation.
 

'Some of the bigger banks should take the lead and be more proactive in lending to property buyers, not just for entry-level but also luxury homes, given that spot prices have already come off about 40 per cent.'
 

Agreeing, another valuer said: 'We provide the valuations. It's up to the banks whether they want to lend, and how much. It's a commercial decision for them.'
 

Giving his take on the challenges facing the profession, a senior valuer said: 'We have to be as level headed as possible and (assign) a sensible value. Valuers play a very important role in the financial system and economy, as we're marking everybody's asset values.'
 

This was the first time Redas has met valuers as a group, at least in recent years, and this follows its maiden meeting in November with analysts in stockbroking research houses covering the sector.
 

Redas also holds regular dialogues with government agencies such as Urban Redevelopment Authority, and Building and Construction Authority. 'Such dialogues provide learning opportunities for Redas and promote better understanding across the industry leading to a healthy property market,' the association's spokesman added.

I think people these days are plain lazy to spend more time to look around. I bought my brand new 2K+ sqft Penthouse Condo for S$550k only in 2004. Of course, hard to find these days but what I'm trying to say is no point paying high price for HDB with no facilities, which is 99 leasehold and you don't expect to live there forever.

You could find transaction data in following official URA website. Both landed and condo. But only those with caveat lodged, meaning not immediate data.

http://www.ura.gov.sg/realEstateWeb/realEs...nController.jpf

However, if the condo got no sales in last 3 months, then there will be no records.

Not sure you seen my reply to you.. http://www.mycarforum.com/index.php?s=&amp...t&p=2747994
 

I find the condo forum (the link is in my reply) to be not bad as over zealous agents will always update the forummers about the latest launches (incl soft launch and re-launch). Then you can sit back and enjoy the show as people start pumping in their comments (some are constructive while others are just plain childish). None-the-less, you will still get some useful info about the development. And they organise their threads by property districts so you can just zoom into the particular geographical area that you are interested in.

If sporean r snatching and eager to buy all these flats, after seeing such scenerio i dun think its consider ex if i am from HDB. Becoz if its expensive den take up rate will be low but its not, everyone r buying and q-ing up for it. The pricing is perfectly right for the flat base on that.

At least there's proper fencing,security , pool , playground and well-manicured lawns and gardens...What do HDB get?

1st few years will be good but after awhile it'll all start to become rundown...

It's not the build quality,it's the maintenance that's the whole problem...

My current estate is suffering from this effects....

Complains are quite useless..The Estate/property officers are just good @ carrying balls...

Conservancy charges plus carpark is only slightly cheaper than the pte. apts....

Not to mention nicer pte addresses...
 

We are actually led to believe that we have choices that we don't actually have...

The future resale values of these flats are more dependent on hype and perceived values rather than actual tangible valuations...

U are partially right.... it is the HDB prices that are exhorbitant whereas the private property market has soften up quite a bit.... and this is probably why you see throngs of people snapping up units at recent launches of heartland condos such Mi Casa in CCK and Caspian over at Lakeside because the gap between private and hdb has narrowed... 
 

But to be frank, who will be the eventual winners and who will be the losers is still quite hard to tell... sekali one fine day HDB come up with a policy to stop the secondary market for resale flats we also won't know. The only way is you either will your HDB flat to your kids or surrender the unit back to HDB for your original value and the $$ goes back into your CPF for retirement.

Bottom line is THEY want us to be completely indebted so that we wont aspire or have the means to leave... 

Brain drain problem solved..... 
 

Buying houses/flats these days , we shud look @ per sq/ft prices...not the total purchasing price...

Start to compare apples to pears....no more apples to apples...
 

Bought my HDB place for $260/sqft...now DBSS is can be up to $400/sqft I was told...How to compare?

Last time when U sell and buy again direct, U can make...Now, dun think so...

I'm gonna dump my HDB 1st thing I can...It's becoming like pyramid selling scheme...just a matter of time before it bottom out...
 

Looking @ Hong Kong, no doubt they privately funded flat prices are sky-high but it's spectacular,man...Super high-rise with built in CPs underneath and some got small mall and MTR station attached....Cool! We all still getting same old design in newer packaging.... 
 

Want to tahan 30 yrs? The stress of living so close in a small place and paying thru my nose is enuff to kick the bucket in no time...Hahahaha!

Take their reverse mortgage to pay for hospital bill? After dat if still alive, may end up homeless.....

Huge demand for flats at The Peak
 
 

DEMAND for flats at The Peak @ Toa Payoh, a condo-like public housing, has been overwhelming.
 

When the developer closed its office at 6pm yesterday, there were already 2,900 applications for the 1,203-unit project.
 

This means there were roughly five applications for every two units. The final number might even be higher as electronic applications closed only at midnight last night.
 

The project at Lorong 1A Toa Payoh comes under the design, build and sell scheme (DBSS), and offers premium condo-like fittings.
 

This project by a Hoi Hup-led consortium is being sold by ballot. Unlike private condominiums, these projects do not have facilities such as swimming pools and gymnasiums.
 

Observers say the demand is surprising given that for the same price, buyers are spoilt for choice in the current lacklustre market.

Anyone remembered our dear Mr. Tan from last year???  
 

AFTER several failed attempts to get a new HDB flat, he was ready to give up and pay more for a private property.
 

Then, home-buyer MR TAN had a stroke of luck - or so it seemed. He found a new five-room HDB flat at City View @ Boon Keng.
 

This is the second public housing project to be built and sold by private developers. Hoi Hup Sunway Development is the developer.
 

Even though it cost a whopping $675,000 - not cheap for a new HDB flat - Mr Tan was okay with the price.
 

But his happiness was short-lived.
 

The 30-year-old and his fiancee, who are getting married next year, found out that they may not be able to finance their new home.
 

PENALTY
 

They are having difficulties securing a home loan and may even have to pay a penalty to give up the flat.
 

The couple's combined income is about $6,000, said Mr Tan.
 

They put up an option fee of about $33,000 for the flat two months ago.
 

But the Housing Development Board (HDB) rejected their loan application for 90 per cent of the cost of the flat last month.
 

This is because Mr Tan's director's fee can't be used for credit assessment, and his fiancee didn't have the pre-requisite three months of continuous employment for the same company.
 

Mr Tan runs a serviced office business.
 

His fiancee quit her last job in February and started work as a personal assistant last month.
 

Upon appeal, HDB said they will be willing to give the couple a loan of about $150,000, but rest will have to be paid in cash and out of their CPF.
 

Mr Tan said: 'Where can I find so much money to pay for the flat?
 

'We were very happy when we managed to get the flat. But with this loan issue, I really doubt we can afford to get the place now.'
 

The 714-unit condo-like development will be ready only in2011.
 

Mr Tan said he and his fiancee had tried balloting for a new flat three times last year.
 

On two occasions, the flats they wanted were already taken up. On another occasion, they didn't get a chance to choose a unit because all were taken up.
 

Mr Tan said he had approached a few banks for loans, but the maximum they would lend was about $400,000, still about $270,000 shy of the purchase price.
 

To make matters worse, if he defaults on this flat purchase, he'll have to pay a penalty of about $8,000 to the developer. This is about 25 per cent of the option fee which he paid for the place.
 

'The developer said that since the sale didn't go through, we have to forfeit part of the option fee,' he said.
 

TEARS
 

'My girlfriend is so upset that she cried and lost so much sleep over the penalty. She said she has never lost so much money before in her life.'
 

The couple had borrowed the money to pay the option fee from their relatives.

Kao.... That is 500++K in cash to top up excluding the amount of interest they have to pay for their new loan.... If they have 500K in the first place they wouldn't had bought that DBSS in the first place.....

I think you need to pay a $10 admin fee to apply, nothing is free in Singapore..



 

Applying is free for DBSS, as far as I know for the earlier batch of DBSS. Applying for any HDB flat, you need to pay $10.

Furthermore, applying is free  



 

You should look at the demand for Simei DBSS - Parc Lumier. Its more than 90% sold out, most of the blocks the chinese quota full, if you chinese you want to buy also no more available.  
 

But the design quite nice, especially the main entrance does gives a condo feel to it.

As much as I also feel that pricing is overboard to me. No use pointing finger cos ultimate decision lies with the buyer to take it.

It is unfortunate but sorry they have to be responsible for their own actions and take it as a lesson.

To make up for the $$ that you are going to pay for it.... Maybe in future HDB might just build only DBSS since so many people are willing to buy such expensive flats.

That could be a possibility. Given the good demand in such economic condition, HDB might just take over the job; meaning they themself construct the DBSS instead of letting the private developer earn the profit.  
 

So in future, good location HDB units = DBSS

Ulu area HDB = BTO

I find the DBSS to be of good value, because the have good location (e.g. toa Payoh, bishan, amk etc) , is new (unlike open market flats which are mroe than 5 years old, some up to 20 years old), and comes with fittings and renovation done, which can save tens of thousand of dollars.  Plus the HDB subsidy of up to 50k, it is even better than buyiing from the open market.  Private condos on the other hand easily cost more than 1 million even in this bearish economy, plus they are old and not new, and need to refurnish and renovate.  The thousands of buyers who opt to buy cant be wrong.

Cause all the renovation cost had been factor into your loan and making it into a larger loan.. Also some people might even renovate again, waste of additional money. Well, I think its still early to say if its a good investment or not. Lets just wait for awhile before we can really say anything about it. But those buying them make sure they have a good job to support them through the loan period.

why not ? a young couple in their twenties may be earning a combine income of 4 to 4.5k per mth, and over the next thirty to forty years of career ahead of them, their income will definately increase with promotion, increment, better job prospect and experience accumulation etc. In fact, commiting to a property purchase is very good, because it forces one to pay for the house as a long term protected investment, as compared to the 80% of people who lost their hardearned cpf in stock market.

That is in ideal situation.. Sometimes maybe after working for many years your pay might not increase that much. Also as time passes new commitments arises, like kids, new car..... Not everyone can have big pay jumps...

Conservatively I tend to agree with you. Such committment is paying it forward on assumptions that pay keep going up and this world is only about 2 of you happily ever after, which in reality is too self-centred. Kids, parents, and other family commitments will change with time. Stretching finances when one is young would probably give a lot of inflexiblility later on in life. 

E.g wife stress at work but no way can quit or take break cos still got instalments to clear; dun want kids cos too expensive as got house to pay already; cant give parents much allowance or pay for medical expenses etc.

I have frens who use these as "valid reasons" for justification simply for self-convenience.

But for a 500K+ flat, how early can you clear it?? I think if with a combine income of 4 - 5k also need to stretch to at least 30years to pay it off... And if 1 gets out of job too long the stress will kick in hard...

everybody takes a long housing loan of 20 years or so, but in realilty nobody will pay for the entire loan period. that's because most if not everyone will eventually sell it off after 5 to 10 years of ownership, and if the past property history is to go by, the property's (hdb, dbss, private) price would have appreciated and then can sell off with a profit or at least break even.  and in general, people's income tend to increase over time, more so for those fresh woork force. 
 

decades ago when mean income is 1k per mth, people say a hdb costing 100k is so high and people who buy are crazy, but today it's valuation is 400k to 500k, who has the last laugh ? not the people who scorn and back off, but is those who appeared foolish and can see the long term potential amidst the short term sacrifise. 
 

myself i bought a 4 room flat about 8 years ago for 170k from hdb, today valuation is 360k . this one is a fact. 
 

today the price of a dbss with good location and new cost 500k, likely ten years later the same history repeats itself, i.e. these buyers will sell for 800k and make a handsome profit.

Provided that there will be admendments to current policy, if not I think the property craze will end soon. Imagine a flat at 800K. Income cap at 8k... That is how many times your pay. There is a limit how much it can go with the current policy, plus yes I agree with you that prices has appreciated through the years but our pay is doing the opposite. You may have it good now but imagine your kid's time...

most young people, or most people for that matter, will spend away their money, if they do not pay for property, e.g. like paying for car, holiday, personal interest expenses. my own financial experience tells me that as a good long term financial planning, when one is young, one should buy property, and channel his income to servicing the monthly instalment.  then in turn rent out the property and collect rental, which can be used to partially pay for the instalment, or accumulated and buy another property.  this way, one will be 'forced' to invest his own income, and not spend it away like modding car or gambling.
 

when the cycle of property boom is up, sell away the properties for a handsome profit.  keep the money until the next property lull cycle, then buy.  i know a lady who did it this way, she had sold 4 of her remaining properties just 1over year ago, and now everyday she is happily retired, go spa do facial and relax everyday. thats the advise she gave me.

I totally agree with you on that. I am one of them who looks forward to buy a new car. While my gf on the other hand keep thinking about going for a far holiday and such... All are actually big ticket items which we can channel to properties to invest for long term. But as said, if doing that means we have to let go lots of things so we can fund our properties and only enjoy the fruits of our labour at near 50s and also if only the current policy changes, if not  I don't think we can see the properties boom over 800k region.

you see, thats the problem of negative thoughts. people will think of 'what if i cannot keep my job in the years to come, perhaps 20 years later ? ', 'what if i want to stop working say fifteen years from now ? then how to pay housing instalment ' , or 'what if my pay dont increase ? ' , and so they will put off that idea of long term investment. why think of the negative prospect ? might as well work hard to make it happen ? it is those with a positive vision and who strive to realise it, rather than those frightened ones, who will make it big in wealth accumulation, which better way than property?

Sell for profit? You mean for the banks right? If a $500k property is financed 90-95%, the so-called profit after 5-10 years may just be enough only to cover the interest incurred. What's more, if one really want to make money from it will have to downgrade to ulu location or smaller unit. The old days of housing appreciating by a few folds is over. Sadly though, even some of these gains made by the older generation ended up back with banks and property developer (pte or public) again indirectly through "loan" to their children.

at an interest rate of say, 3% pa, after 10 years of a loan of $400k, the interest payable for this period is 120k, simplistically speaking.  Byt he next property boom cycle (say about 10 years from now also), the selling price could well be 800k.  The profit of 300k is more than enough than the interest, leaving a almost 200k profit.
 

take my own case as an example, (must stress that am not want to hao lian but this is factual), i bought a 4 rm hdb for 170k, valuation is 340k (neighbour sold for 370k), the profit is more than double the original purchase price.  so how is it not possible for the 500k dbss property to fetch at least 800k in ten years time ? in fact, it will easily be more than double that in time to come surely. just look at the property prices in hongkong and you will see where we will be in the future, because land scarcity is fixed and this is a long term determinant of property price.

You are assuming that in the future, there will be buyers that are willing to part with $800k to buy a flat...
 

Not that it never happened before. My ex-neighbor paid $700k for a resale hdb flat during the pre-97 days. I am sure at that time, everyone also had the similar trend of thought that in 10yrs time, HDB flat may cost $1mil...... So even at $700k in 1997, it looks like not too bad a deal. After all in the 80's, flats only cost $100k+ so the capital appreciation is proven..... 
 

Then the market crashed.  
 

I only paid $400k for a similar unit in the same block in 2003. Our valuation never got close to the $700k mark even during the recent boom...

I like your optimism. Yes, of cos with the right attitude and expectation, setting life targets like property purchase for retirement planning and long-term investments are definitely good moves within one means. The danger lies in over-committment.

I have an alternative theory which i believe very much will come true: HDB prices will no longer as much upside as it used to. That is, at yr 2020, the prices of HDB flat will not exceed more than 20% of current prices. Reason is as follows:
 

The average earning power of a worker during the 1970s and 1990s have a gulf of a difference. However, if we were to look carefully at the average salary of a degree/diploma holder from 1997 vs the current average pay of a diploma/degree holder, the increment is not much. At the same time, the peak prices of HDB properties for the past 15yrs and 2007 is nowhere near the degree of price inflation from 1980-1997 period. 
 

Basically, what I'm trying to say is...unless the average worker's salary can go up significantly(discounting inflation) within the next 10-15yrs, prices of HDB flats will not go much higher than current prices. So for those who just bought a 500K HDB flat and expects to make a tidy profit by selling it at $1million 20yrs down the road...no chance babe. Try that for prime district condos instead

No diff lah...if u buy stock or ppty during crazy heady times, u are fxxked anyway.

For ppty is worse, cause it is leveraged asset, same same as u take bank's stock leverage lending to play.
 

u ask all the unkers who bought hot HDB ppty just prior to '97. 

cannot even smell the price during the rcent ppty boom during 2007.

u & i are lucky to have bought in at low px. i got my flat in 2004 at 194k, i just sold it at 360k.

but not everyone is in our situation or had the same experience.
 

u take a look at the URA and HDB resale index. 

for every buyer, there is seller. Those who sold high need someone to buy high. the only sure thing is if our GDP goes up, property px will go up.
 

ppty is not always an asset. if u overstretch, it becomes double edged sword.

Your take is only true if you have another place to live in and this hdb is just bought purely for investment purpose.  Contrary to your reality, Most people do not have a second home.
 

If not, sell already stay where? Sell off at 360k, then u need buy another one to stay in, how much would the other equivalent housing cost? Minus the cost of this plus renovation, the final figure may go negative. Unless you are going for downgrade to smaller or more ulu locations which i wouldnt consider this as a real profit.

Application is free.   Hence many applied but never exercise option.

That's why this thread is never ending because we are all wondering why even bother to apply in the first place when later got no money to exercise option.... or is it really a case where these people got plenty money and think 700k for a flat is cheap

No diff lah...if u buy stock or ppty during crazy heady times, u are fxxked anyway.

For ppty is worse, cause it is leveraged asset, same same as u take bank's stock leverage lending to play.
 

u ask all the unkers who bought hot HDB ppty just prior to '97. 

cannot even smell the price during the rcent ppty boom during 2007.



 

I dunno why pple keep talking abt the next boom. The next boom only applies if u r going to downgrade or u have alreadi 2 properties or is picking up ur 2nd one in the downturn
 

As for someone who has no property rite now and do not see myself being able to take a smaller loan.

My plan is to buy somewhere to stay in 2 yrs time. Wait for the next boom-bust cycle to hopefully get a 2nd property on the next downturn with hopefully not such a big loan. 

If i want to divest my 1st property, it will be in the boom cycle AFTER the next one. By then i should be reaching my late 40s. 
 

Its not sexciting i know, but i think its more financially prudent (also cos im not born rich/lucky haha   ). 

Cos kids, car, parents arent cheap to maintain. N all 3 are necessary expenditure

some homeowners will beh song if the prices of their ppty tanks, even if they do not intend to sell. "wealth" effect.

some may have OD line tied to house so if price down, bank will cut line or ask them to top up if they are over limit after the line is reduced.
 

as u have rightly pointed out, price up or down makes no difference if u do not have a second property or a place to squat (usually with in laws).
 

cos if u sell high, u end up buying high cos u need to vacate in 2 months (usually).

I'm all for the expensive DBSS.
 

As expensive as possible, so it means that i can sell my exec hdb which i bought for 300k++, at a much higher price.
 

I can sell at 600k, and pple might still buy. 



 

Before jumping to the conclusion that your unit can sell for $600k (not saying its not worth it), need to confirm if the location is consider good with lots of facilities in the neighbourhood and walking distance to MRT? I still believe why a 4-room can be more expensive than a executive unit is because of the location.

What kind of people can buy DBSS? Those sole-proprietors/self-employed bought it because they "under declared" their income.
 





 

Some of them could also be existing HDB owner whom already paid up their unit, so just selling their unit can cover a big portion of the costs already.

Can see those $100k ~ $200k vehicles with HDB seasonal parking disc in HDB carpark. If HDB owner can afford driving such cars, I'd say they are rich enough to go for DBSS.

Think it is SG style, free go put name first, if later dowan also nebermind, won't lugi $$. If you see  those normal HDB execise it is also always the application exceeding the quoted unit. But end of the excercise, there's alway left over. For $10, these ppl just can afford. Guess if $1000 think the application to actual application will be more in correct ratio.

HDB resale is obviously governed by 

1. High floor/view

2. Location near MRT

3. General district/general ammenities
 

But barring the condos right smack beside MRTs, does MRT access matter that much? Most private property enclaves are usually quiet and more "ulu" and are usually not so close to MRT. 
 

In tat sense, are potential buyers of pte propety looking at the project's exclusivity (ie nice quiet enclave kind of area) or looking for convenience with terms to MRT?  

Not talking abt usual district 9-11 but the more outlying regions like telok kurau or say west coast.

I think road access is of course impt since most condo owners wld drive.

Anyone with any XP wld like to comment?

I think even for private property, the proximity to MRT station would be a plus point. 
 

For example, the private property along bukit timah road, with the construction and commisioning of MRT lines in the near future, do you think the property price there would increase or decrease? 
 

Unless all the people in the house own and drives a vehicle, I think MRT and other public transport is still applicable for schooling children or other family members whom does not drive.

Unfortunately there's nothing mechanical about price mechanism.
 

If only it were so simple, have a formula that takes into account inflation, salary increases, GDP and a host of factors, and then arrive at some pricing formula for things like real estate.
 

But here we are dealing with buyers and sellers sentiments, which is anything but logical. When times are good, no price is too high. When times are bad, all bets are off.

Irregardless of price up or down, banks are the winners.

As long as we live within our means, it is safe.
 

The property prices in SG is basically controlled by HDB. During downturn like now, HDB only

plans DBSS for the upgraders to jack up prices in "so-called" prime mature location. So that

prices of HDB are maintained in high level when transactions take place. 
 

There is no reason why SG property can maintain strong when the global prices of property are heading southward. So to sum up, SG property market is basically monopolistic. 
 

BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

For private properties, yes i'd agree that logic will go out of the window when times r good.
 

But for HDB flats, if it were to cost 700K on average for a 5 room and 600K average for a 4 room, you can be assured of mass revolt. Therefore, my take is that, for HDB average prices, the garment will not allow the valuation of them to rise to a price whereby an average singaporean couple will not be able to service the loan (with a 8K combined income ceiling).

Thats right. HDB prices are actually controlled by the garment. Thats y there is a limit on how much the valuation can go up within the next 10-15 yrs.
 

Private properties prices on the other hand is a totally new ballgame whereby prices are controlled mainly by market sentiments.

Private property price can still be controlled indirectly. Except for freehold and 999 years, 99yrs leasehold land belongs to Governement. When that piece of land is open to tender, and if the bid comes in too low, they can dun award the land cos price too low. Tell me, can this be consider price manipulation? Though the intend is to prevent conspiracy, the underlining intend is debatable.

It's not that they are suckers.......this thread has dragged on and on... simply becos they are all having 'pigeon holers' mentality... 
 

You can teach a pigeon to fly from one place to another but they'll still fly around or back to the pigeon holes whichever hole that may be....
 

They can be termed 'condo hole's or simlpy .."Built to Order Holes'! 
 

Still a 'HOLE' what!.

My take on this is the same as most forumers here. How the hell you expect a HDB flat to be valued at $1mil (if you expect a profit to be made on DBSS flat), when your income doesn't increase by the same proportion? You can expect the buyers to retire only at 80 years old maybe. Maybe it's a govt strategy for our workforce to continue working and increase our productivity, and to prevent people from migrating.  
 

As for me, my combined income with my wife is close to $10k, and we have gotten ourselves just a humble $200k HDB resale, which is now valued at $350k, and will be finishing my loan in 3-4 years time. After which we will get a second property, to ride on the future waves of property boom. And I'm sure that property I'm looking at will still be cheaper than that $700k pigeon-hole

Any one know when the cap at 8k executed on which year? What is the price of a 5 room flat during that time? I believed the 8k cap is set at their validation on the afforability of the income on the most expensive flat during that period.
 

If the price of the 5 room flat has increased by xxx time, shouldn't the cap be concurrently increase in par as well?
 

If you agreed, what should the corrected revised cap be for current period?

I'm not sure when was this $8k ceiling set, but I got a feeling that this ceiling would be revise upward in the near future. Perhaps setting different cap for different size/type of HDB units? This could be one tool HDB might use to maintain the price of HDB so that it would not drop too much.

There has been talk about raising the salary cap limit for the longest time.... The nearest we got was the $10k cap for ECs... 
 

But to be frank, I doubt HDB will be raising the cap because that will only serve to spike up the demand for new HDB flats as more people becomes eligible whilst at the same time reduce the support level for resale flats....

Might not be that bad thing for resale, because potential purchaser if they falls within the cap can also buy resale and get HDB loan and grant. So increasing the salary cap may indirectly support resale demand as well.

Oh ya... I forgotten about the grant and HDB concessionary loan rate....  Then I guess you have a good point, the overall demand for HDB regadless of new or resale may increase...

I used to live ard the area and I have to say I belong to the other camp.

But if you got the pricing before they adjusted it upwards, I guess that would be the mitigating factor.
 

That aside, the property market is still adjusting itself. You can see a gulf in expectations between owners and buyers. explains why so few transactions for now.
 

But I think sellers ("specuvestors" not occupiers) will slowly wake up to the new reality. The ppty mkt got ahead of itself and some bubbles have to deflate further. Property price increase cannot run ahead of income increase.

Actually I am buying to stay so as long as I know I did not buy it on a high, that thought alone should let me sleep easy at night. Plus by moving into that area, I get to fulfil the dream of someone very dear to me (that's like a childhood neighborhood that carried a lot of fond memories) so that in itself is priceless...  
 

I guess you are spot on about the "non-generic" factors....

so u apply for it? 
 

i went to see the showflat yesterday, just want to be kaypo.  i stay in TP by the way. 
 

not trying to be a wet blanket to you.  the design of the 4 room and 5 room really CMI. 
 

did u notice that they didnt put in the balcony sliding doors so that the show flat give a false impression of more space? 
 

at the 4 room unit, u notice that the stupid sofa is placed beyond the balcony?  when u move in, there is the sliding door.  u cant put a 3 seater sofa. 
 

you can only put a 2 seater sofa.  and how big is yr family? 
 

you cant remove the sliding doors coz first HDB wont allow tat, and secondly, if remove, yr living hall will be opened up coz u are not allowed to put windows at the balcony. 
 

looking at the kitchen of both show flats, u notice the store room door is just next to the wash basin?  if u are doing something at basin, someone needs to open the store room door, u need to move away. 
 

look at all the bedrooms, did u notice the beds are customised to be place above the bay windows?   the showflat gives a false sense of space again.  
 

if u buy those normal bedframe, your walking space into the bedroom will be be 1 foot distance!!!   What a joke!!!
 

the bay window takes up space and u got to customise the beds so that u will have more space to walk!!!
 

and this includes the masterbed room also. 
 

at the 5 room showflat, u notice how small is the living hall is?  that sofa displayed is only a 3 seater.  maybe 1.8m max.  and that's already the entire width of the hall.   
 

and u notice there is no dining area for the 5 room?  
 

again, they took out the balcony sliding doors to give u a false sense of space. 
 

u notice that laundry area?  the clothes poles are so short. i dun think we can hang any clothes there.....
 

the gas stove that they are giving.... i told the agent this stove is for zhi char stall type.  he kept quiet.....
 
 

let me say that the ONLY thing that is nice abt the PEAK is the masterbed room toilet.  that's all..........

No wet blanket because I did not apply for it....
 

Sabian and I hijacked this thread to talk about another purchase I made... It is not a DBSS but it is no less "controvesial" and also sparking a lot of debate in some other forum......
 

Anyway it is quite a common tactic for showflats not to put up where the actual sliding doors to your balcony are in order to create a sense of having a bigger living room area.... at least for those showflats that I have visited recently.
 

But good job in providing such a detailed FR.. .

got to be observant when visiting showflats..... we are paying so much, so got to make sure we actually get what we see.
 

basically the PEAK design totally CMI.  well, the only selling point is the TP location, provided the home owners are able to put up the design flaws for many years to come

i have lurking ard this topic and let me say something.
 

the prices of homes are very subjective.  we cannot just see the price and start to comment whether its cheap or bloody ex. 
 

we got to see the interior of the home itself.  TP, Queenstown is very ex, no doubt. but not all flats there are nice.  
 

many of them has very weird designs.  i have seen enough of units.  
 

Some of u say TP flats are good, right?  Imagine, i have ever seen unit that has a pillar outside of the bedroom windows.  the pillar is actually part of external design of the entire block.  So stupid.  And this is a TP unit. 
 

Some of u say Bishan flats are good, right?  many of the 4 rooms flat has pillars in the living hall and the lift doesn't go on every floor.  another stupid design.
 

some units are facing the rubbish chutes.  some have very strong afternoon sun..........
 

sell me at below valuation, i also dun want all these units.
 

Price is only one factor.  there are so many factors to consider.
 

I have seen a Bishan unit. Mansionette unit.  the owner really do up the unit damm nice. i'm very particular person, and i must his unit is the best i ever seen in my 4 months' search.  His toilets are really hotel style and damm clean. 
 

no pillars, rooms are all square, facing the right directions of the sunlight
 

but his price is really high. the owner very confident of selling it.  i got no budget, i must say his home is worth his price.  last i heard, it's been sold already.

Prices may be subjective but valuation is not.....  
 

Sellers can ask for the sky or the moon or whatever else but until I see a recent valuation report or at least get an indicative from the bank, I will not commit...  But then this is just my style...

just to add one more to Donut's list of show room con job, a lot of the "queen size" beds in show room are actually customized to be maybe 1/2 a feet shorter and narrower. so it gives you the impression of space. try lying on one, and you realize your feet are jutting out.

not every DBSS flat is 700+k, majority are 400-600k.... usu. there are only like less than 10 flats in the whole DBSS development that is more than 700k? its definitely not for the run of the mill 8k couple. maybe upgraders/downgraders who sold their flat/condo who is cash rich, flats with 4 occupiers contributing to the cost, fresh lawyers or fresh investment/private bankers (not sure how much they earn these days though) although they probably bust the 8k bracket the moment they step out of school.

Condo-style HDB flats selling well 

But at prices of $500,000 to $730,000, the Design, Build and Sell Scheme units don't come cheap
 

By Joyce Teo, Property Correspondent
 
 

Account manager Samuel Lee and his wife were among those who bought a five-room flat at Parc Lumiere in Simei. 
 

Although the recently launched condo- style HDB project offers something more than a regular HDB flat, its location - more than anything else - was what sealed the $477,000 deal for Mr Lee, 27. 
 

'Facilities-wise, it can't beat The Peak and Natura Loft,' he said, referring to two similar projects. 
 

'It's the location. It is literally just across the road from my in-laws'.' 
 

Thanks to buyers like him, Parc Lumiere is nearly sold out, even though its first-come, first-served sale method meant that many buyers had to brave the heat and queue for hours before they got to book a unit. 
 

However, those keen on a condo-style HDB flat - or what HDB terms a Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) flat - need not fret because there are still units available. 
 

The 360-unit Parc Lumiere, for instance, has 30 five-room units left for sale, while the 480-unit Natura Loft in Bishan has more than 100 five-room units left. 
 

DBSS projects are designed, built and sold by private developers. 
 

They are ungated and are subject to public housing rules, such as the $8,000 household income ceiling, ethnic quota and a five-year minimum occupation period. 
 

But unlike regular HDB flats, they offer condo-style fittings and layouts. 
 

There are balconies, bay windows and timber flooring in the bedrooms. The kitchen comes with built-in cabinets and the rooms with built-in wardrobes. 
 

They do not come cheap though. As HSR Property Group executive director Eric Cheng said: 'DBSS projects offer very good concepts, interior finishes and layouts, but the only problem is the price. Those with insufficient CPF savings will feel the pinch of the premium for those extras.' 
 

ERA Asia Pacific associate director Eugene Lim pointed out that at their current pricing of $500,000 to $730,000, DBSS flats are priced just a shade below mass market condos in the range of $650,000 to $900,000. 'There is already a slight overlap,' he said. 
 

Property agents said last month before the launch of Parc Lumiere and The Peak that there might be some resistance if DBSS flats were priced above $500,000, particularly given the recession. 
 

Prices at the 1,203-unit The Peak @ Toa Payoh go up to $722,000. At Natura Loft, developer Qingjian Realty said five-room units are available at $590,000 to $739,000, or from $456 per square foot to $578 psf. 
 

PropNex spokesman Adam Tan said that while DBSS projects come with designer furnishings that are typical of condominium units, buyers need to be aware of the fact that outside of one's door, the environment is like that of an HDB estate. 
 

'There are no facilities like pools,' he said. 
 

DBSS projects are for those who want the interior atmosphere of a condo but not the facilities and the relatively hefty maintenance charges that come with them, he added. 
 

HSR's Mr Cheng said DBSS flat buyers are also buying a home in a conducive environment that has been carefully planned by the developer. DBSS flats are also usually in very tall blocks, and some have high ceilings typical of private flats. 
 

Indeed, each DBSS project is different in design and size. Each will attempt to offer features that promise a bit more exclusivity than your regular HDB estate. 
 

Parc Lumiere and Natura Loft offer elevated landscape decks. The Peak has a card-access security system at all ground-floor lift lobbies. 
 

At Park Central in Ang Mo Kio, the rooftop garden above the carpark features a 400m jogging track. 
 

Unlike regular flats, DBSS projects may offer premium appliances. Natura Loft, for instance, offers rain showers and Electrolux cooker hobs, while The Peak offers Daikin air-conditioning systems. 
 

Currently, there is just one other vacant DBSS site in Bedok Reservoir Crescent, but the Government has yet to launch it for sale. 
 

Although falling private-home prices have presented low-end home buyers with more options, some have their hearts firmly set on a DBSS project. 
 

Mr Lee, for instance, compared Parc Lumiere to a Melville Park condo apartment but decided against the smaller unit in the latter. 
 

'I've also considered the resale value. When the Tampines DBSS project came out, people said the price was very high. Now, based on the experience of the Tampines DBSS, I don't think we will lose out.' 
 

In late 2006, the first DBSS project, Premiere @ Tampines, drew nearly 6,000 applications for 616 flats priced from $138,000 to $450,000. Housing prices have risen since. 
 

But whether DBSS buyers can make a profit on resale will depend on how the mass market moves, said ERA's Mr Lim. 
 

For DBSS flats to be resold at say $600,000 to $850,000, mass market condo prices will need to move up higher to between $800,000 and more than $1 million, he said. 
 

'This is possible if there is another economic boom that brings all-round prosperity and the whole property market moves up across all categories,' said Mr Lim. 
 

'Whether it can happen in seven to eight years, it is difficult to predict. If it does happen, it will likely be a window period for these DBSS flat owners to make the resale profits. Usually, the best time to sell a new flat on the resale market is when it is about five to eight years old. Thereafter, prices may dip again.'
