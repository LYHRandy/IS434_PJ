I am starting this thread as a complement to the main thread on property news and prices. I hope some of these tips/suggestions gained from actual dealing on the ground would be helpful to homeowners/buyers.  I will start off with the below burning question that  I get all the time....why some units break record prices but some could not be sold for months and months.
 
Selling your property for top dollar
 
Firstly, let's define what is top dollar? In my terms, top dollar would means selling above market valuation. Often, it also means breaking the record price of similar units in the same estate/condo. Over time, I observed that these price record transactions had a similar trend. To get top dollar, contrary to most beliefs,  it definitely has much more science to it than art.  Top dollar deals seldom come from just listing and pray; it has a method to it. Unfortunately most sellers/agents never really took the method seriously and in most cases, never get top dollar for their units.
 
As this is a post and not a blog, I will keep it short and concise. To sell for top dollar, you need to understand the below on the psychology of a buyer when they come for viewing:
 
1) Buyers use very little logic when viewing, they tend to follow their emotions more
2) Emotions arise not just from what they see, but also from the other senses such as smell, feel,  touch and hear
3) Sellers always make mistake by assuming that the buyer can imagine an empty house. The buyers don't and they won't
4) The key then is to be able to reach down to the sub-conscious of a buyer by invoking their positive emotions during viewing.  Houses that gets top dollar often make the buyer feel 'right" and they then use their emotion to justify their logic.
 
Failure to consider the above is the key difference between getting no offers (or market valuation at best) and one with a top dollar offer.
 
Understanding the above,here are my 10 tips for sellers based on my experience:
 
1) A cluttered house kills good emotions. Always un-clutter the house before viewing. Throw away junks and keep the house tidy. The owner is selling the house and will need to move soon...use that opportunity to start clearing the house. This issue is so prevalent in many units that the seller  think that the buyer will imagine an empty house. Again they won't!
 
2) Fix all minor defects. Again, too many sellers thinking that the house gonna be sold, what is the point of fixing it up. You don't have to renovate the house, but you should fix up all visible defects. Even a new coat of paint on any old house does miracles in getting good offers
 
3) Clean the kitchen top and uncluttered it. A clean good looking kitchen makes a lot of difference in getting top dollar. If there is one place that make the difference in offers, it is the kitchen. The buyer's wife/gf/mother has a lot of emotions attached to the kitchen and in most cases, they are also the CFO to the purchase.  Unclutter the kitchen top  and make sure the stove and built-in oven looks clean. I even had a seller once storing his microwave away just to clear up space for his very limited kitchen top space. 
 
4) Dining table. Another culprit which is always full of everything except dining stuff. Clear it, and put an attractive piece, a vase with flowers, etc at the center. Pull the buyer eyes to the center of the dining table and let him feel that they can eat comfortably at that table. 
 
5) A well lit, unblock, entrance door. Clear away your shoes or anything untidy at the entrance. An unblock well lit entrance creates eagerness to explore more of your house. 
 
6) Masterbed room is important and it must look like it is ready for relaxation and sleep. I have seen many master bedrooms that has clothes hang in it, or the seller cramped a study table into the master. If you confuse the buyer over the purpose of that room, chances of getting a good offer is as good as nil.
 
7) Always give exclusive to your trusted agent. I seldom see record selling deals that are from open listing.  Open listing agents are prone to be "tested" by the buyer agent and their motivation to close will bring you a lower price. Furthermore exclusive agents are motivated to do every viewing for you hence has minimal viewing leakage.
 
8) Be flexible in your ability to open doors for viewing. Great offers can come from any viewing time and if you restrict your viewing time to evening or weekends only, you are restraining your ability to get good offers, Two of my record breaking sales came from afternoon weekday viewing. Hence, never, never have viewing leakage.
 
9) Check if your house has certain odors especially for those with pets. The houseowner is often immune to any smell, but the buyer will sense it at a distance. And if you have pets that could walk around the house, (or make noise, for.e.g barking) , please bring them out somewhere if you have viewings. Again, please don't assume that the buyer can imagine that your pet won't be there when they make the purchase. They won't. Remember, the sense of smell and hearing invoke powerful emotions so if you want to get top dollar, make sure those senses of the buyer are not affected.
 
10) I leave the last point to the advertising. Good advertising attracts viewers. Unfortunately I've seen many seller/agents use mediocre handphone photos to advertise. Some photos are so bad that a young Instagram-obsessed teen  would probably take better. If you already took the effort to do fix up, unclutter the house, etc, the last thing you want is to have photos that does not depict your house accurately. Wide angle photos, imo, is  the minimal requirement.  Videos and virtual tour are great, but only if your house is of a certain size.  Buyers will sub-consciously drawn to  sellers/agents who take pride in advertising their house and first impression does count in this business. Don't neglect this which I somewhat keep seeing all the time.
 
There are many  more concepts that I can keep going (the use of colours for e.g)  but the above is suffice for most sellers if they want their property to fetch good offers. Infact, I seldom see all 10 points click into place, but if they do, that property should get good offers.  It is very often for me to hear that some units could not be sold for months, but when another agent took over, it get sold within  one month at the same asking price. I don't believe it is all luck.  It has to do with the method right from advertising to preparing the house for sale.
 
I hope the above helps in giving some ideas in getting good offers for your property at your location. Your property is one of your biggest investment so it is worth the effort in putting the right "sciences" into it and get the top dollar offers.

great writeup.  i agree especially on point 7, and 1 & 10 in same breath.
 
where point 7 is concerned, it must be on proviso of a trusted agent.  if the agent is dodgy, inexperienced or different motivation from owner, it could do more harm.
 
whereas for point 1 and 10 i talk of them in same breath.  i have noticed that untidy or cluttered house sells for less as well.  in fact many years ago, i wanted to buy 1 house bcos it ask less because of it being cluttered.  but i could see that it is not in anyway inferior to projects of same development on the market.  but some agents are really exacerbating this situation (point 10).  they even put up the untidy photo for advertisement in propertyguru.  granted photos are a must in these days of adeertising for property for sale online, still a bad photo is actually worse than no photo.

Great effort and heart and soul made into writing this.
 
It offers a refreshing angle pegged to the issues sellers deal with or should deal with.
 
Maybe someone could write on what to look out for when buying houses, addressing buyer perspective?

Bro...I see if I can find time to write the one for buyers.
 
But as a quick one,  feel that for buyers, the most important thing is to figure out their few most important requirements and be very focus in finding units that fulfill those requirements. In the current market, good deals are getting lesser by the day, so if a buyer suddenly shift goal post and make U-turn in their requirements, they have just wasted a good amount of time previously looking at units that didn't fulfill their requirements.  And if they had found a unit earlier, it could have been cheaper too.
 
Buyer must remember that in the current rising sentiments, time is truly money.......before we even talk about getting good value, please figure out the requirements and be very focus in finding units that fulfill those requirements.

agree but like to add on, even in good times, i prefer a focused approach whether as buyer or seller.  i don't really like those agents whose approach of buying/selling house is like shopping for cheap grocery - see more units (for buyers) or attract more viewers (for sellers) is better than low nuber of viewings.  waste time on both side, make buyer confused or lose out a deal and in all likelihood also contribute to seller getting a lowered price.

Spot on. This approach is the best from my ground observations.

2 of the worst i saw is whereby their photos show laundry on laundry racks in the living room or strewn all over the place like on chairs, sofa etc.
 
i can't imagine even as a professional, they let such photo get by their professional gaze

Have you seen the naked man in property picture?

yep, that photo was on my mind when i started criticising the photos posed by agents these days.

This is a very unfortunate incident.
 
What happen is that this could be an open listing where the owner sent his house photos to the agent to market.  The agent then, without checking the photo, simply post it up to the online platforms/
 
When I started my career, I would refuse to list any listings with owners photo if they are open listing. I would request to allow me to go to the unit to take photos myself.  If the owner refuse or no time to entertain my request,  I would drop that owner. I do this because
 
1) I want to meet the owner and understand his requirements. Nothing beats meeting face to face and advise him properly even if there is no exclusive given
2) By seeing the unit myself, I can position the unit better for sale or rental.  There is no way I can describe a unit accurately to a prospect  simply by looking at owners photo
3) Most owners photo are the same ones given to every agent and I do not want my listing to be the same as others.
4) By only looking at owners photo, there is no guarantee that is exactly the house that I am marketing. Sometimes owner may make mistake by sending a wrong set of photos and last I want is to surprise the viewer that the house he came for is different from the photos.
 
This particular case is really a wake up call to all open listing agents.  I hope everyone learn something from it including the owners.

Hi hi, you mind sharing the average annual income of agents ?    
The newbies.....
The mid career....
The established.....
 
At which point of career do you consider yourself?
 
 
Do you specialise in a district?
Do you specialise in landed, condo, HDB?
Do you specialse in sale or rental?
 
I know you’ve no intent of marketing your services, but sharing your industry knowledge is a powerful marketing tool.  And if your services is asked, it’s a compliment.

Someone ask me today what is the worse condition unit that I ever sold and still manage to sell above market valuation?
 
Good question....because I think it can be a good case study.
 
I think it is a 3-rm HDB 47 year old unit that I sold last year when the market sentiment was poor.
 
This unit is old, mostly stock condition and the only renovation is probably the flooring, kitchen cabinet and toilet.  But the reno was done 20 years ago so you can imagine the condition now.  There is no wardrobe in the rooms even. And unlike the newer 3-rm HDB, this one have only one toilet in the entire house. With the age being 47 years old, there are cpf and loan restrictions. so many buyers wouldn't want to consider it. Only great point is the location is in the city.
 
5 agents were marketing for 6 months, could not get it sold. The owner offer only 1% comm. For a 3-rm hdb where prices is around 350k-380k around that area, 1% comm is less than most 3bedder condo rental deal....why would most agents put in the time and effort to do a sale?
 
I came into the picture because I was intrigue by this deal. Sounded like  a good challenge to prove a few points. Advise the owner for an exclusive, but refuse...however he gave me the key. That was the saving point. 
 
I looked at the house.....being a vacant old unit, there was nothing much to play with, so three things has to be right:
 
1) The advertising got to be perfect to capture as many possible viewers.
2) The viewing, if any, must be done to accomodate the buyer so that there is zero viewing leakage.
3) The house must be spotless and clean because being vacant, any dirt can be easily noticable.
 
I remember camping myself at the void deck for nearly 2 months so that I can conduct viewing anytime.  I have the keys, so that was easy except that the owner was also doing viewing with other agents on weekend.  My advertising  was different from the rest so I am quite confident I will get most of the viewings. I have a broom in the kitchen, so I would usually sweep away any dead insects (very common in old HDB) and clean the kitchen top (if dusty)  before any viewings.
 
To cut the long story short, in almost 2 months, I conducted 49 viewings......wasn't easy but in the end, the unit was close for 10k above HDB official valuation. The owner was ecstatic......in a down market, his very old, almost stock condition unit still gets 10k COV!  (I still get 1% regardless) 
 
I felt really happy for the owner but I took up the case to prove that sometimes, effort and commitment is the most  important in getting top dollar. This house has nothing inside, everything old, so the only difference an agent can make is on the marketing and the commitment to conduct every viewing regardless of the time. I just want to debunk that to get top dollar, you need to have a great reno inside the house. That's good to have, but not a necessary ingredient. Most important is the basic.....uncluttered house, clean, and then lots of commitment in advertising and viewing.

I would like to give some insights to the current market situation. As the market is going though a transition, I hope o give some clarity based on recent observations.
 
 Private non-landed 
 
1)  D9, 10, 11 is picking up strongly. Hard to find good value buys here
 
2) For RCR, D4, D12 and D14 still has good value buys.  Focus on these 3 areas if you want to find value for RCR.
 
3) For OCR, buying momentum is strong compounded by good sales in new launches.  However D25 and D26 is lagging. Personally,  I think D25 (Woodlands) has a lot of hidden value because of the potential there after the Northern Corridor redevelopments.
 
Landed
 
1) Picking up well  following the trend of private non-landed, but because it is the most depressed segment over the last 4 years, it  still has better value overall compare to private non-landed.
 
2) Landed, once it picks up, can increase at a faster pace due to limited supply.  Those who wants landed should quickly decide this year before prices escalates away
 
HDB
 
1) HDB segment is having a divergence compare to private. While private segment prices are increasing, HDB continues to be depressed.
 
2) I worry for HDB resale......there is quite a fair bit of oversupply in the overall market. 
 
3) It seems to me that many are selling their HDB either at market or below market just to quickly upgrade into the private sector.
 
4) Popular areas like Bishan, AMK, Toa Payoh, overall  is surprisingly selling below market on average. Different type has different demand (executive in Bishan has very high demand and above market for e.g) but overall these 3 towns show below market overall. As prices here are typically quite high, I suspect owners are willing to let go lower to sell off fast.
 
5) Big HDB units (executive. massionette, etc) has strong demand and mostly selling above market.  Pasir Ris, Bishan and Bukit Batok executives are the most popular and selling above market mostly.
 
 
Overall comments
 
1) For popular area and good private resale units, prepare to pay some COV. Very unlikely bank will match valuation because prices are increasing. Look at D4, D12 and D14 to find valuation resale buys. 
 
2) Many new landed projects has good $psf.  Look at those if you are keen. They are far more reasonable than condo launches.
 
3) New condo launches are increasing prices for their balance units. 
 
4) For private resale, pointless to look back at last year and say that prices are now expensive.  That opportunity is gone. Even though it is more than last year, most are still lower than the 2013 peak. Look at the overall picture, not just last year.
 
5) I think that the Q1 2018 PPI number are going to be high and that may spur even more buying momentum.
 
The above are my general observations, so please use this info at your own discretion. Nobody can predict how the trend is going to go so the above are just general comments.  For my clients, I will normally go into greater details depending whether they are buying or selling.
 
Hope the above is helpful to some.

HDB
 
1) HDB segment is having a divergence compare to private. While private segment prices are increasing, HDB continues to be depressed.
 
2) I worry for HDB resale......there is quite a fair bit of oversupply in the overall market. 
 
3) It seems to me that many are selling their HDB either at market or below market just to quickly upgrade into the private sector.
 
4) Popular areas like Bishan, AMK, Toa Payoh, overall  is surprisingly selling below market on average. Different type has different demand (executive in Bishan has very high demand and above market for e.g) but overall these 3 towns show below market overall. As prices here are typically quite high, I suspect owners are willing to let go lower to sell off fast.
 
5) Big HDB units (executive. massionette, etc) has strong demand and mostly selling above market.  Pasir Ris, Bishan and Bukit Batok executives are the most popular and selling above market mostly.
 
 
Overall comments
 
1) For popular area and good private resale units, prepare to pay some COV. Very unlikely bank will match valuation because prices are increasing. Look at D4, D12 and D14 to find valuation resale buys. 
 
2) Many new landed projects has good $psf.  Look at those if you are keen. They are far more reasonable than condo launches.
 
3) New condo launches are increasing prices for their balance units. 
 
4) For private resale, pointless to look back at last year and say that prices are now expensive.  That opportunity is gone. Even though it is more than last year, most are still lower than the 2013 peak. Look at the overall picture, not just last year.
 
5) I think that the Q1 2018 PPI number are going to be high and that may spur even more buying momentum.
 
The above are my general observations, so please use this info at your own discretion. Nobody can predict how the trend is going to go so the above are just general comments.  For my clients, I will normally go into greater details depending whether they are buying or selling.
 
Hope the above is helpful to some.

 
Thank you, this is great!

That's a good question. And one that is often shrouded with mystery and misunderstandings
 
There are about 29,000 licensed agents in Singapore. While it is impossible for me to go into their stages of their career and how much they earn, I can make quite logical estimation that less than 20% of them earned more than $100k a year.  The other 80% is less than this number but to some people, even taking 50k a year is good for them.
 
Despite all the glamour, and popular media talk about agents, most does not really earn that much. Somehow everyone thinks agents make millions every year, that's imo, is the biggest BS out there. The problem with this industry is that the media and the agencies tend to over glamorize the earnings, because such news sell and such earnings can recruit better. In most cases, it is just simply selective reporting to me. Then the top 20% tend to market themselves as successful with photos next to their sport cars and such and that sort of exacerbated the image and the impression of the industry.
 
Now think about it a second. In that 29k of agents, a big majority are part timers, and some are retirees,  they either have income somewhere else or are just trying to find something to do. Does anyone really think those will be big income earners?
 
Real estate work is a business, not a job and like all businesses, some will be successful, but most will fail. Everyone knows this about businesses, but yet everyone think all agents are big earners and becoming an agent is their sure path of becoming rich. End of the day, it is a business, and most businesses fail. That's the hard truth which most agencies will not tell you. However, for the good businesses, it is hard, hard discipline work. Ask any successful entrepreneur and they will tell you all the rough tumbles they had before they were successful.
 
Having said the above,  on the flip side, trying to be in that top 20% is also not an impossible task if they know what to expect in this industry and do the right things. You know that 80% of your competition is not exactly strong, so the job is to compete with that 20%.  That part is not easy, but if you are in that group, you will survive.  For me, I have been in that group right in my first year.
 
For myself,  I don't specialise in a particular district and I can do condo, HDB, landed, rental or sales. I have done every residential type before.  I know the intricacies and challenges of each type and these days I advise on portfolio restructuring  so it i  important to know each type.  I am also trying to recruit these days, because I feel the profession need people who are honest, serious, committed to the client success and not to their own wallet.  To be successful they need to know the hard truth (and I hate glamorizing selective  high incomes during recruitment talk and all the ra-ra. I mean this is a serious profession dealing with others life savings, what is all the ra-ra for?) and then learn how to overcome those by providing real value and not just some hocus pocus slick sales talk.  If anyone keen to join this industry, contact me.  It can be really rewarding if you have the right focus, expectations and a mentor who care about you being in that top 20%. However, I am pretty selective on who I recruit because I want a quality team, not a big team.
 
Anyway, this thread is not about me but about providing value to others, so if you need to know more, PM me.

 
hehe i ever think of joining to market my own properties

Someone ask me today what is the worse condition unit that I ever sold and still manage to sell above market valuation?
 
Good question....because I think it can be a good case study.
 
I think it is a 3-rm HDB 47 year old unit that I sold last year when the market sentiment was poor.
 
This unit is old, mostly stock condition and the only renovation is probably the flooring, kitchen cabinet and toilet.  But the reno was done 20 years ago so you can imagine the condition now.  There is no wardrobe in the rooms even. And unlike the newer 3-rm HDB, this one have only one toilet in the entire house. With the age being 47 years old, there are cpf and loan restrictions. so many buyers wouldn't want to consider it. Only great point is the location is in the city.
 
5 agents were marketing for 6 months, could not get it sold. The owner offer only 1% comm. For a 3-rm hdb where prices is around 350k-380k around that area, 1% comm is less than most 3bedder condo rental deal....why would most agents put in the time and effort to do a sale?
 
I came into the picture because I was intrigue by this deal. Sounded like  a good challenge to prove a few points. Advise the owner for an exclusive, but refuse...however he gave me the key. That was the saving point. 
 
I looked at the house.....being a vacant old unit, there was nothing much to play with, so three things has to be right:
 
1) The advertising got to be perfect to capture as many possible viewers.
2) The viewing, if any, must be done to accomodate the buyer so that there is zero viewing leakage.
3) The house must be spotless and clean because being vacant, any dirt can be easily noticable.
 
I remember camping myself at the void deck for nearly 2 months so that I can conduct viewing anytime.  I have the keys, so that was easy except that the owner was also doing viewing with other agents on weekend.  My advertising  was different from the rest so I am quite confident I will get most of the viewings. I have a broom in the kitchen, so I would usually sweep away any dead insects (very common in old HDB) and clean the kitchen top (if dusty)  before any viewings.
 
To cut the long story short, in almost 2 months, I conducted 49 viewings......wasn't easy but in the end, the unit was close for 10k above HDB official valuation. The owner was ecstatic......in a down market, his very old, almost stock condition unit still gets 10k COV!  (I still get 1% regardless) 
 
I felt really happy for the owner but I took up the case to prove that sometimes, effort and commitment is the most  important in getting top dollar. This house has nothing inside, everything old, so the only difference an agent can make is on the marketing and the commitment to conduct every viewing regardless of the time. I just want to debunk that to get top dollar, you need to have a great reno inside the house. That's good to have, but not a necessary ingredient. Most important is the basic.....uncluttered house, clean, and then lots of commitment in advertising and viewing.  

 
i love your positive attitude and sense of positioning and pitching.  there is very little money to be made for marketing this unit and you took it on for the point to prove rather than the money to be made.  kudos to you!

I once had a client who wants to be an agent.  Thought he was joking but he did went for the course and exams.
 
If you are keen, PM me. I can advise on which school to go, and why. I wished I had these information when I first enroll into a school. 
 
But be prepared to put in a lot of effort in the RES course. It is a very tough exam. Getting that license is hard and for a good reason. Also, as I practice, I do noticed that the newer agents are more knowledgeable  more respectful and more diligent in their work. It is good for the profession.

I agree that the profession is getting SLIGHTLY more professional. There are the old birds around who still have 10 year old practices. But CEA is more diligent on regulating the profession now..

I'd like to share my experience when selling my flat the last time.
 
1) Give exclusive rights to your agent. The agent must be recommended through word of mouth from someone you know we'll. Giving exclusive means he will be more committed to selling your flat at the highest price possible since it's to his benefit to do so. Having only one point of contact for you is better so that you don't have to manage mutiple clashes of schedules for viewing.
 
2) Clean up and declutter your whole flat first. Then get the agent to organise a single day open house within the first week of listing. Having an open house with multiple prospects create an illusion of competition and brings out the kiasu nature. When you know you have competition, you wanna make a fast decision if it's your dream flat. During the open house, switch on the air con and lights for the whole house, diffuse some nice aromatherapy scents, basically make your place like a developer showflat so that it feels good to the senses
 
3) During small talk with your prospects, Always say you're upgrading no matter what. To a bigger place, or better location, or to EC/condo/landed. This implies that the flat has good fengshui, it has brought you huat huat that's why you're upgrading, and it can help influence their decision.

Hahaha, referring to your point 3, you will lie regardless.   
If so, you are the type who have sympathy on used car dealers who are dishonest like you.  Regardless which ah beng car is it, the dealer must always say is doctor's spare car, low mileage, doctor upgrading.

Allow me to address point #3 brought up by member TheoldJaffa in post #22
 
For most of the cases I had seen, selling is indeed mainly for upgrade. So using the "upgrade" reason is quite safe most of the time.
 
However, if the sale happens to be one of those bad reasons for e.g divorce, financial difficulties, death, etc. my suggestion is to be honest about it. Never, never lie to the buyer especially from an agent. 
 
But guess what....if a seller has prepare the house well, and able to drive the emotion of the buyer, then being honest about the bad reasons doesn't quite matter.  Remember that in a buyer psychology, emotions drive logic.  If his emotion is high, even a bad selling reason will not deter him from offering the seller a good price. Infact, he could possibly justify that it is ok to pay more knowing that he is dealing with honest people.
 
You may think it is hard to believe, but it is true. I give you guys an example.
 
Recently the "haunted" house at Jalan Batai was auctioned off at $2.23m when the auctioneer was only hoping $1.7m-1.9m. Why did the buyer pay almost 500k above valuation when the whole Singapore knows that house has an infamous reputation? It is again Emotion. Because of the history of that house, that auction attracted an overwhelming crowd so emotion, pride, ego all runs high during bidding.  Those emotions defies all logic despite the  reputation.  Adding the fact that 90% of auction property does not really sell during  an auction, this Jalan Batai sale is an amazing demonstration in the power of emotion.
 
So to cut the story short, prepare the house well first (using what I mention in post #1). Then get a trusted exclusive agent who will do every viewing for you. Drive the emotion of the buyer and if the selling reason is upgrade which is mostly the case, then great, if not, just be honest about it.

Actually it may not be being dishonest. There could be half a dozen reasons to sell, upgrading being one of them.
 
I doubt buyers will shut off sellers by first shortlisting those with acceptable reasons, then proceed for viewings.

Agree except for (1). Give an exclusive to an agent only if you know of an excellent agent who will always get the results. Unfortunately this is rare. Agents tend to specialise in different types of properties and locations. For majority, you will likely get better results by making it an open listing. The caveat is you have to be aware of the different tricks agents will play to get you to lower your price to lock in their commissions and will have to be very clear and  firm (which comes with experience)  with your requirements across all agents marketing your property. You will have to go to the extent of monitoring their asking prices  at various portals so that they do not undercut each other and willing to spend personal time for viewings which also helps you to size up the tenants (buyers does not matter).

Bro...I am not sure if you read my first post, but I can tell you that if a seller wants to sell for top dollar, giving exclusive has a much higher chance of achieving that.  I have never seen consistent record breaking prices that come from open listing. Sure...once in awhile there may be one or two, which boils down more to luck than a consistent method of achieving that.

 
I doubt buyers will shut off sellers by first shortlisting those with acceptable reasons, then proceed for viewings.

 
Seldom happen. Normally they ask reasons only during viewing.

Yes I have been following this thread closely. So far I have not been selling, only buying. So I will not have solid grounds as yet to dispute your stand on the selling part.
 
However I have gone through at least 50 rental contracts over the past 15-20 years and open listing has always paid off. This year alone I have done 2 and will be doing another 2 more rental contracts and all open listing.
I did try exclusive occasionally but it never worked as well as open listing, The moment the exclusive period was over and I converted it to open listing, the number of viewings increased dramatically (even after qualifying the viewings to ensure only those with the right profile and budget view it).  The rents I have been fetching have always been above average for the development.
 
Based on my vast experience in renting out my properties via open listing, I believe the same should apply to selling a property.

Thanks for sharing bro. I think all these inputs help as we all have different experiences from various properties, so all these sharing give a lot views for others to make informed decisions.
 
For exclusive, it needs to be an agent whom you know, can trust and very responsive. Responsiveness is very important for rental because when a tenant or cobroke enquire, if no quick response, they will just move on to arrange other units .For sale, number of units are usually lesser than rental so buyer or co-broke is willing to wait for response. This is perhaps why for rental, open listing may work because speed is essential.  However, if you can find an exclusive agent who is also extremely quick, I believe he will get the tenant for you just as quick (or better price) as well.

My personal experience depends on a few issues:
 
1. which country
2. since commission according to CEA is not fixed and there is no industry standard, hence how commission is paid
3. co-broking, most agent don't like especially from a different agency so may limit your chance to close deal
4. agency network - if small agency the reach on your listing in their internal computer will be limited, yes property guru helps but who really call up and finally close a deal, usually use for reference as an end-user
5. rental or sale  - realistic price
6. if you are a buyer, look for an aggressive and hungry agent, eg my agent go to hospital to ask seller to sign when the seller was about to go for surgery and on another occasion, drove to KL to get seller signature to sell.
7. for sale, personally, I don't really want to rely on one agent, if I am selling at a reasonable price, a serious buyer will bite, if I sell at market price then must be wait, if sell above market price then need to be patient
8. if you find a good agent that takes care of your interest, then good to treat him or her like a friend and build a relationship, make sure in any deal, both win-win then you have a secure a long term partner.

I want to highlight the above point that it is against CEA guideline if an agent refuse to co-broke. Because by refusing to co-broke, he/she is limiting the closing opportunity for his/her client. That is against client's interest.
 
So far, based on my experience, agents from larger agencies do not have an issue on co-broke whether with the same agency or not.

Thank you Icedbs for the writing. Those are really informative. 
 
I am thinking, on average how many viewing an average buyer use to end up buying one property? 
 
I have viewed 6 units in a two week interval, 3 of which are in a small 100 meter area, 3 small condos. Am I viewing too much and waste too much of agents' time? 
 
 
Are there practices one buyer must use one agent in a particular agency? Assume I viewed a unit with agent A from AA, next time when I call agent B from AA for another district, will B likely ignore me?

Today I am going to share about Rentals.  Over the years, I myself had went through many rental cases and learned that a good rental experience between tenant and landlord is not something that happen by chance. Almost everyday I would get questions from fellow agents on how to settle certain dispute or issues.  Most, could actually be avoided. I know everyone has their story when comes to rentals, but consider the below as suggestions from a full time professional in achieving a good rental/lease experience.
 
* Note: In my post below, I will use the word "broker" to depict the person handling the deal. This can be landlord/tenant/agents depending who is the one facilitating the tenancy deal
 
How to ensure a great tenancy experience for both landlords and tenants
 
1) The biggest issue in doing a rental deal is that most brokers treat the deal like doing another resale transaction....for.eg, mostly getting the paperwork right or negotiate price. A rental case is unlike buying/selling another property and has to be handled with far more considerations towards human relationship between all parties. 
 
2) As such, the broker working on the deal not only has to manage expectations and price negotiations,  but also manage the impression that the landlord and tenant feel between each other. If both parties has the right impression of each other from the start, then that tenancy has a high chance of an amicable one down the road. Managing impression is the secret sauce to ensure the tenancy gets off a good start. Unfortunately, this is often lacking.
 
3) Right from the start, the broker has to find ways to create good impression for all parties. This is often easier said than done. Good impression of a tenant comes from a tenant who is complete in his initial paperwork , reasonable request, and prompt payment of his security & booking deposit. And finally prompt payment of his first rental AFTER moving in. Good impression of a landlord comes from a prompt delivery of the requirements in the LOI and most importantly able to address quickly any genuine issues found during first 30 days after moving in. 
 
4) During the tenancy negotiation, the broker must strive for a win-win for all parties. The issue here sometimes is that some overzealous brokers tend to fight for own interest only and does not care about the constraints of the other party. That can create a sour feeling. Nobody likes to feel that they have been taken advantage going into a deal. 
 
5) Becareful of red flags right at the beginning. If a tenant  has some non-standard request such as paying his security deposit in installments, or that he has issue transferring funds from overseas and hence cannot pay his deposit on time, PLEASE DROP THAT TENANT regardless how good his profile is. Similarly, if a landlord  (or his agent) is slow at responding to some simple LOI items, or the broker has a tendency to hide owner identities then please drop the deal regardless how attractive is the rent or the house. Trust me, all these are signs of problems down the road. I am always very careful about this to protect the interest of my client.
 
6) During the first 30 days after handover, the agent (or the landlord) must be quick in following up every issue that is brought up by the tenant regardless how trivial it may be.  Adaptation to a new place need effort, and having a caring agent/landlord will give lot of assurance to the anxious new tenant. From my experience, in most cases, once the agent/landlord shows that they always there, the adaptation issues will just suddenly "dissapear".  There was once a new tenant called me up at 10.30pm because the inlet hose to the washing machine was leaking.  There is no hardware shop that opens at 10.30pm, so I took my own inlet hose from my washing machine and brought it down to the tenant at 11pm and fix it up for him. He was totally in awe of the response time and never had an issue ever since. 
 
7) Always practice give and take. Always give notices in advance. Always consider the constraints of the other party and be reasonable about it. Treat the other party like how you want to be treated.  These are basic human relationship goodwill practices.
 
8) If a tenant for some reasons, suddenly shows late payment (more than 2 weeks) start sending him polite formal notifications even if he does pay up after that 2 weeks. Keep these formal notifications on record. In the event that the late payments became habitual, and getting later and later where eviction becomes inevitable, then these notifications serve as an evidence to support  that eviction notice. Manage these unfortunate  events professionally so that eviction notice, if any, is just an outcome and not a surprise. Eviction is always tough, I have went through it before, but as long one manage it respectfully it can be done without too much anger by all parties. 
 
Ok....there you have it. There are other details that I left out in order to keep the post short, but the above are the key points. Of course, there is no gurantee that even with the above steps, the tenancy will always turn out to be great.

agree on the human relationship part of the deal as rental is more long term than just a sale deal. my wife actually was asked to help with some freelance by one of her ex landlords due to the good relationship

Today I am going to share about Rentals.  Over the years, I myself had went through many rental cases and learned that a good rental experience between tenant and landlord is not something that happen by chance. Almost everyday I would get questions from fellow agents on how to settle certain dispute or issues.  Most, could actually be avoided. I know everyone has their story when comes to rentals, but consider the below as suggestions from a full time professional in achieving a good rental/lease experience.
 
* Note: In my post below, I will use the word "broker" to depict the person handling the deal. This can be landlord/tenant/agents depending who is the one facilitating the tenancy deal
 
How to ensure a great tenancy experience for both landlords and tenants
 
1) The biggest issue in doing a rental deal is that most brokers treat the deal like doing another resale transaction....for.eg, mostly getting the paperwork right or negotiate price. A rental case is unlike buying/selling another property and has to be handled with far more considerations towards human relationship between all parties. 
 
2) As such, the broker working on the deal not only has to manage expectations and price negotiations,  but also manage the impression that the landlord and tenant feel between each other. If both parties has the right impression of each other from the start, then that tenancy has a high chance of an amicable one down the road. Managing impression is the secret sauce to ensure the tenancy gets off a good start. Unfortunately, this is often lacking.
 
3) Right from the start, the broker has to find ways to create good impression for all parties. This is often easier said than done. Good impression of a tenant comes from a tenant who is complete in his initial paperwork , reasonable request, and prompt payment of his security & booking deposit. And finally prompt payment of his first rental AFTER moving in. Good impression of a landlord comes from a prompt delivery of the requirements in the LOI and most importantly able to address quickly any genuine issues found during first 30 days after moving in. 
 
4) During the tenancy negotiation, the broker must strive for a win-win for all parties. The issue here sometimes is that some overzealous brokers tend to fight for own interest only and does not care about the constraints of the other party. That can create a sour feeling. Nobody likes to feel that they have been taken advantage going into a deal. 
 
5) Becareful of red flags right at the beginning. If a tenant  has some non-standard request such as paying his security deposit in installments, or that he has issue transferring funds from overseas and hence cannot pay his deposit on time, PLEASE DROP THAT TENANT regardless how good his profile is. Similarly, if a landlord  (or his agent) is slow at responding to some simple LOI items, or the broker has a tendency to hide owner identities then please drop the deal regardless how attractive is the rent or the house. Trust me, all these are signs of problems down the road. I am always very careful about this to protect the interest of my client.
 
6) During the first 30 days after handover, the agent (or the landlord) must be quick in following up every issue that is brought up by the tenant regardless how trivial it may be.  Adaptation to a new place need effort, and having a caring agent/landlord will give lot of assurance to the anxious new tenant. From my experience, in most cases, once the agent/landlord shows that they always there, the adaptation issues will just suddenly "dissapear".  There was once a new tenant called me up at 10.30pm because the inlet hose to the washing machine was leaking.  There is no hardware shop that opens at 10.30pm, so I took my own inlet hose from my washing machine and brought it down to the tenant at 11pm and fix it up for him. He was totally in awe of the response time and never had an issue ever since. 
 
7) Always practice give and take. Always give notices in advance. Always consider the constraints of the other party and be reasonable about it. Treat the other party like how you want to be treated.  These are basic human relationship goodwill practices.
 
8) If a tenant for some reasons, suddenly shows late payment (more than 2 weeks) start sending him polite formal notifications even if he does pay up after that 2 weeks. Keep these formal notifications on record. In the event that the late payments became habitual, and getting later and later where eviction becomes inevitable, then these notifications serve as an evidence to support  that eviction notice. Manage these unfortunate  events professionally so that eviction notice, if any, is just an outcome and not a surprise. Eviction is always tough, I have went through it before, but as long one manage it respectfully it can be done without too much anger by all parties. 
 
Ok....there you have it. There are other details that I left out in order to keep the post short, but the above are the key points. Of course, there is no gurantee that even with the above steps, the tenancy will always turn out to be great. But what I do know is that if we do not keep to the above suggestions, there is a high chance that the tenancy turns into another nightmare. What I like to achieve for my client in a tenancy is not just a good leasing deal, but one that is filled with pleasant experience in terms of human relationship for all parties.
Great post!  
Respect and humility will go a long way between tenants and landlords.
 
I suppose that because of the requirement for certain character attributes, being a landlord may not suit everyone.

You are right. I have a lot of respect for landlords who could do tenancy for years and years. Most of them are wealthy, have quite a few  properties, but extremely humble in attitude. And their agents love working for them.

When my family sold our maisonette many years back, we had an awesome agent that did a lot of what was written. We received many offers with in 1 month of posting and managed to sell it at a very good price.
 
The only issue was, we sold our place so fast, we had trouble looking for a new one. My mum walked into a house that is cluttered, walls were stained with incense but still decided to purchase the house as the location was good. Of cuz, she pushed the price down an secured the deal just after 30 mins of viewing.

Good to hear that you have eventually sold and hopefully at a price you like.
 
If you have a few agents, typically they will harass you to close asap because that's the nature of the model.  The buyer will just call each one of them and test to see who will bring you the low price. 
 
Anyway, if you need other advises, just PM me anytime.

Allow me to address point #3 brought up by member TheoldJaffa in post #22
 
For most of the cases I had seen, selling is indeed mainly for upgrade. So using the "upgrade" reason is quite safe most of the time.
 
However, if the sale happens to be one of those bad reasons for e.g divorce, financial difficulties, death, etc. my suggestion is to be honest about it. Never, never lie to the buyer especially from an agent. 
 
But guess what....if a seller has prepare the house well, and able to drive the emotion of the buyer, then being honest about the bad reasons doesn't quite matter.  Remember that in a buyer psychology, emotions drive logic.  If his emotion is high, even a bad selling reason will not deter him from offering the seller a good price. Infact, he could possibly justify that it is ok to pay more knowing that he is dealing with honest people.
 
You may think it is hard to believe, but it is true. I give you guys an example.
 
Recently the "haunted" house at Jalan Batai was auctioned off at $2.23m when the auctioneer was only hoping $1.7m-1.9m. Why did the buyer pay almost 500k above valuation when the whole Singapore knows that house has an infamous reputation? It is again Emotion. Because of the history of that house, that auction attracted an overwhelming crowd so emotion, pride, ego all runs high during bidding.  Those emotions defies all logic despite the  reputation.  Adding the fact that 90% of auction property does not really sell during  an auction, this Jalan Batai sale is an amazing demonstration in the power of emotion.
 
So to cut the story short, prepare the house well first (using what I mention in post #1). Then get a trusted exclusive agent who will do every viewing for you. Drive the emotion of the buyer and if the selling reason is upgrade which is mostly the case, then great, if not, just be honest about it. 

 
i have encountered paranoid or spooked buyers before.  they mind if the flat has occupants that divorced before, died before, contracted major illnesses before.....besides spooked buyers, there are also bargain hunters or low ballers.  they look for such reasons to drive a hard bargain on the prices.  hence for me, i will never be completely upfront although i wont be dishonest.  what this means is that if i am selling because of a divorce case, i won't offer it as the first reason to put forward.  like another brother says, people sell houses for variety of reasons.  i have 3 reasons to sell, i just quote 1 it will suffice.  however, i won't be dishonest as it will come down to state of misrepresentation.  so if the buyer ask for delcaration that none of those bad incidents happened in the house during my ownership, i will truthfully declare it.
 
anyway the paranoid or spooked buyers are always those that believes in fengshui but understand very little about it and so they become paranoid.  for an unfortunate incident to take place in the houe, it entails the confluence of 天,地,人 factors.  a house by itself is seldom so bad and powerful as to drive an unfortunate outcome on its own.  so sometimes we are doing them a service by not being entirely upfront.
 

I want to highlight the above point that it is against CEA guideline if an agent refuse to co-broke. Because by refusing to co-broke, he/she is limiting the closing opportunity for his/her client. That is against client's interest.
 
So far, based on my experience, agents from larger agencies do not have an issue on co-broke whether with the same agency or not.

 
i have encountered agents who refused to co-broke.  and most times they are likely to be plying their trade in the ccr condos.

bro, just checking on one practice.  
 
in the past, i always thought the caveats to property are lodged by the lending bank and buyer doesn't have a say as to whether the caveat can be lodged.  recently i came across a case, caveat not lodged and according to brother's friend who did it, he instructed the lawyer not to lodge a caveat.  don't the lending bank have to agree to this request?  why would any lender bank agree to such a request?  does the bank secure their collateral in the property using the caveat or otherwise?

Did that deal took a loan in the first place?  If a bank is involve, it is unlikely they will not lodge the caveat during the S&P period.

Then that's very strange. I suggest you find out the full details why the bank did not caveat the property.
 
Caveat has nothing to do about using the property as a collateral.  Caveating is a way for the bank to "chope" the property before completion just to prevent another buyer from having the right to buy the same property while the S&P and the loan disbursement is in process.

thanks for the clarificaiton.  if it s meant for choping property i would think the bank may relent on having to lodge a caveat.  afterall, the window of exposure is much shorter and they can hold the buyer with penalty clauses should the loan eventualy be not drawn down in the event it went to another buyer's bank, isn't it?
 
yes i am asking my brother to check with his friend.

Preventing the buyer from going to another bank is one thing, but also to prevent another new buyer from claiming interest in that same property.

but practically, would it be possible this thing can happen?
 
i mean if the buyer submits all the valid and executed purchase documents, how can it possible for another buyer to claim interest in the same property?

The chances of happening may be remote, but not impossible.
 
Real estate transaction remains complex and can be prone to error, oversight, mistakes, lack of understanding, miscommunication etc.  So the process of caveating may circumvent unwanted circumstances that may arise from these mistakes.

I got a question today from a buyer where he notice that a lot of new mass condo launches have about 50%-60% consist of 1 and 2 bedders. These units are mostly from 400-600++ sqft.
 
I think a lot of forumers here also complaining about units getting smaller.
 
But we know that developers build based on demand and not just about managing the quantum.  So I do a bit of research on households in Singapore, and I am not sure how many of you know about the chart below
 
Notice that only half of the resident  households are couple with children. The other half of all resident households are either alone, couple without kids or lone parent.
 
So if you are wondering why units are getting smaller, it is really because households with couple and children are shrinking. Even in 2016, about half of the existing households are very small household. And if the developer cater some small units for investment purposes, the unit mix of 50-60% for 1-2 bedders  (mass condo) seem to be right.

When one buys a unit smaller than 50 sqm, will it be likely that the strata share value of the unit is rounded up to 1 while large units are likely being rounded down? During enbloc, will the compensation the owner get be based on share value or gross sqft?

This is a very unfortunate incident.
 
What happen is that this could be an open listing where the owner sent his house photos to the agent to market.  The agent then, without checking the photo, simply post it up to the online platforms/
 
When I started my career, I would refuse to list any listings with owners photo if they are open listing. I would request to allow me to go to the unit to take photos myself.  If the owner refuse or no time to entertain my request,  I would drop that owner. I do this because
 
1) I want to meet the owner and understand his requirements. Nothing beats meeting face to face and advise him properly even if there is no exclusive given
2) By seeing the unit myself, I can position the unit better for sale or rental.  There is no way I can describe a unit accurately to a prospect  simply by looking at owners photo
3) Most owners photo are the same ones given to every agent and I do not want my listing to be the same as others.
4) By only looking at owners photo, there is no guarantee that is exactly the house that I am marketing. Sometimes owner may make mistake by sending a wrong set of photos and last I want is to surprise the viewer that the house he came for is different from the photos.
 
This particular case is really a wake up call to all open listing agents.  I hope everyone learn something from it including the owners.

not true. They post and the agent will always say the unit that I last sold was this ..(messy and smaller ) than this and already just gotten word that there is already a buyer closing the deal. So this one that I am showing you while its cheaper and better maintain will be gone soon. Fast hand fast leg and pass me the cheque..

I'd like to share my experience when selling my flat the last time.
 
1) Give exclusive rights to your agent. The agent must be recommended through word of mouth from someone you know we'll. Giving exclusive means he will be more committed to selling your flat at the highest price possible since it's to his benefit to do so. Having only one point of contact for you is better so that you don't have to manage mutiple clashes of schedules for viewing.
 
Once you give him exclusive, it is to his advantage to sell the flat as quickly as possible (most probably for as low as you will accept!)
 
2) Clean up and declutter your whole flat first. Then get the agent to organise a single day open house within the first week of listing. Having an open house with multiple prospects create an illusion of competition and brings out the kiasu nature. When you know you have competition, you wanna make a fast decision if it's your dream flat. During the open house, switch on the air con and lights for the whole house, diffuse some nice aromatherapy scents, basically make your place like a developer showflat so that it feels good to the senses
 
3) During small talk with your prospects, Always say you're upgrading no matter what. To a bigger place, or better location, or to EC/condo/landed. This implies that the flat has good fengshui, it has brought you huat huat that's why you're upgrading, and it can help influence their decision.

I always put car salesmen and property agents. in the same category. They will say anything , twist & turn to get their commission. Applies to at least 95% of them. I am not lucky enough to find someone who falls in the remaining 5% and thus will stick to non-exclusive whether selling or leasing out.
Maybe the 5% can only be found in this forum and gathered here to enlighten us on why we should have exclusive agents,
That's why agents I use must be referred via word of mouth. 
So far I've not had any lousy salesperson for my property, car and reno.

Of course.... but if you think you got the "right agent", is it necessary to give exclusive?
 
fact remains that giving exclusive only gives the agent the opportunity to push you to accept a lower price so they can close the deal.
Yes I stand by my decision to give exclusive. It's an endorsement of my commitment to him in exchange for his commitment to give me his best effort to get me the best price so as to get the highest comm. 
It's like marriage you know, if you found the right woman, is it necessary to get married?

By giving him exclusive, you are giving his your commitment to him...
 
But where is he giving his commitment to you at the same time to get you the best price? Unless your commission structure is tiered, selling price is not going to affect the commission much at all so "highest commission" is meaningless.
 
Read the sentence I highlighted from your post again...
 
 
Can share how selling at the highest price possible is to his benefit? Mind you, this has nothing to do with whether or not your agent is a good one or not. I can agree that giving exclusive to him means he will be more committed to push your flat because he knows he is the only one marketing it so he has higher chance.
 
Selling price and commission (1%):
 
1. Sell for 1mil: 10k commision
2. Sell for 1mil+30k : 10k+300dollars
 
if you are the agent, ithe incentive to close the sale with you by trying to convince you that 1 mil is the best you can get is going to be stronger than telling you that you can get 1.03mil if you wait a little since he risks losing his entire commission over 300 bucks.
Aiyo why do u keep biting on this? 
I'm sharing my real life experience which worked for me.
 
If it doesn't work for you, so be it lor.

Frankly speaking, we will definitely evaluate his personality, character, trustworthiness, integrity n etc before giving the agent the exclusivity..
If u dun give them this carrot, how u expect him to focus on your property?
You want good price n buyer , need to take some calculated risk..
We also have the right to push him for results..
If the agent is a snake , take it as a life learning lesson..

Let me chip in this because I know where you are coming from.
 
But let me ask you a question.
 
If you think that agents will push for a low price simply to close (when selling), then between an open listing agent and an exclusive agent, who do you think will be more incline and quicker to do so?

its a no brainer, sell multiple 1mil rather then have to deal with 20 viewing and buyers whim and fancy like .. "tell me why should I buy this unit ..." kind of ego trip...
 
The same cannot be said for a average 30Mil GCB...

In this post, I am going to demystify the art of getting a great residential tenancy experience in Singapore.  The below will apply to landlords, tenants and even agents. 
 
When I first started my RE career, the number of sad stories in the rental scene is almost enough to get me running  back to a corporate job. Landlords often complain about tenants and tenants will often complain about the landlord agent or the landlord. It seems that tenancy simply equals to disharmony among human beings and every party seems to have an axe to grind with somebody else. 
 
After  going through hundreds of tenancy cases, I believe the 5 tips below will greatly help you in ensuring a great tenancy experience.
 
The 5 important tips to a Great Residential Tenancy
 
1) Start with the right mindset 
 
Over the years, I realised that many sad tenancy cases started off with the wrong mindset about the other party.  Because the landlord owned the house, some feel that they are the "boss" and the tenant is the "subordinate". On the other  hand, tenants think that they are the "paying customer" and the landlord is the "vendor". 
 
The right mindset to think about the entire tenancy is that of a "business partner" where they both actually have a common stake in the property. The tenant wants a comfortable living and hassle free property. The landlord needs to have decent return on his investment and a well maintained property.  To achieve their goals, they should look at each other as a business partner where each has a role to contribute to achieve each other's goals.  If they can start with the right mindset, then a great tenancy is already halfway in the making.
 
2) Always strive to be fair to the other party
 
This point seems to be common sense and everyone likes to think that they are the fairest and nicest person around.  But in fact, this point is the hardest to execute. Ask any agents and they will tell you that it is hard to be fair. 
 
The issue is that humans are inherently greedy and like to have the best bargain. There is nothing wrong about this as long it is done upfront and ethically with a consideration for the other party.  Striving to be fair would sometimes mean compromising on certain issues but trust me on this, you will gain back much more in return through a great tenancy.
 
The point about being fair to the request of the other party serves two important function:
 
1) Both parties felt that they have entered into a tenancy on a similar level playing field and as such, gain trust and respect for each other
2) Whenever there are issues, both parties are more willing to listen and work together to resolve an issue because they know that the other party has proven to be righteous and fair right from the start.
 
A good agent will  advise their clients if their request and decisions are out of line and does not appear fair to the other party. Striving to be fair is the best way to act for the interest of the client.  Helping the client to fight for unfair advantage is actually doing more harm to the client in the long run.  
 
3) Try to keep the tenancy terms to market practices and norms.
 
Most tenancy agreements have a standard template that contains the market standard clauses.  However, the clauses can be changed depending on what is given in the LOI and the other wishes of the landlord.
 
It is  always better to follow the standard market practice as much as possible.  The reason being that when standard market terms are used, everyone knows that they are dealing with widely accepted practices and there is no ground to doubt that they are being taken advantage. If special terms are needed, make sure a good reason is given and the reason remains fair to the other party (goes back to point 2). 
 
4) Respect the Initial Tenancy process
 
This point is so obvious, but again some people doesn't  take it seriously. The initial process starts with an offer and requirements from the tenant. Often it is a verbal offer for the landlord agent to bring back to the landlord for discussion.  If the landlord accepts it, the tenant should quickly proceed with the LOI and the first month booking deposit for the landlord to sign.
 
It is a simple process, but some tenants exploit it. They would make 3 offers at the same time and 2 of the landlord will get rejected even if they had accepted the offer. The rejected landlords will then feel so frustrated that it is their turn to treat the next offer less seriously when the next one arrives. 
 
And then sometimes it is the other way round. The tenant followed the process,  got the LOI to the landlord promptly, but the landlord now sit on the LOI and refuse to sign  even though he has verbally accepted the offer. Reason being that he is waiting for other better offer. The poor tenant is now being delayed, not sure whether  to wait or simply cancel the deal. 
 
All the above creates sour feeling right from the start and is the beginning of doubts and skepticism that will slowly ruin a possible good tenancy. The only time the above situation is minimise is when both sides have their agents and  the agents have the obligation to respect the process as part of their code of conduct. 
 
5) Stop any deals that have hint of non standard payment request during the initial stages.
 
The above is one big warning sign of impending tenancy issues down the road. Never ever give in to the above point.
 
What do I mean by point 5 above?  It is when tenant or landlord make non standard payment request that doesn't quite follow the standard processes . For example, the tenant is expected to pay the security deposit at the point of signing the TA.  But he asked if he can pay that only during handover that is probably 2 weeks or 1 month down the road. Some landlords are kind enough to defer the security deposit until handover. But this is actually a big warning sign that he could have issue paying his rent promptly in future.
 
Never take risk on the above situation. Any signs of non standard request of payment during the initial paperwork stages often means some financial difficulty at the start and it is better to just cancel the deal than to take the risk.  Evicting tenant due to rental arrears is a very painful process.  Don't go through it.
 
Conclusion
 
If you have read till here, you probably realize that the 5 points above is really about managing expectations and creating trust right at the initial tenancy stages. It doesn't look too difficult, but why is there so many tenancy runs into dispute and issues?
 
The initial stages is a process that is often overlooked because it is a stage where negotiation takes place. At this stage, landlord/tenants often think about the requirements. prices, commencement date, etc and how it affects them immediately and less about following process, or be fair to the other party demands or putting themselves into the other party shoes which will affect them in the long run.  I will often manage the bigger picture at this stage so that everyone enters the tenancy with a good feeling towards the other party.
 
Still, every tenancy has its risk, but  from experience, if the front is done correctly, often the tenancy will be a pleasant one down the road.

While it is true you have a higher chance of selling by impressing prospect buyers with well done interior. 1st impression counts. 
 
For buyer like me, the interior finishing is the least concern because I have my other ideas after purchase. Therefore the least the better as I don't want to pay for things I need to tear down later.
 
It is always about location and the development, not the interior. So keep it simple and don't try to oversell. The prospect comes broadly for 2 reasons. Just to see and compare and those really interested with this development. Most have already done their homework, would you if you are investing more than a million?

actually quite common.
 
A lot of owners flip very often before the ABSD and SSD measures. 
 
Thesedays, if they can make some $$$ after the SSD period, they will sell and buy again too.

Other cities can not prevent uprising in prices as well from 2013 to 2017. Only 1 country that is doing well economically succeeded in doing so during that period.

yeah. Long time back, when I was doing my regular reservist, there was this hokkien peng in my group that always have a need to change address.
 
Being typical me, I ask, whao.. u runaway from Ah long is it. I see u keep changing address.
 
To my amazement, he say, he being flipping HDB and resale as well as selling condo queue and apparently doing quite well .
 
So while I was cautious on such good lobang, I also went doing what he shared.
 
But soon enough, MBT curbed it and I only manage to do perhaps 3 throws.

Thank you

I am starting this thread as a complement to the main thread on property news and prices. I hope some of these tips/suggestions gained from actual dealing on the ground would be helpful to homeowners/buyers.  I will start off with the below burning question that  I get all the time....why some units break record prices but some could not be sold for months and months.
 
Selling your property for top dollar
 
Firstly, let's define what is top dollar? In my terms, top dollar would means selling above market valuation. Often, it also means breaking the record price of similar units in the same estate/condo. Over time, I observed that these price record transactions had a similar trend. To get top dollar, contrary to most beliefs,  it definitely has much more science to it than art.  Top dollar deals seldom come from just listing and pray; it has a method to it. Unfortunately most sellers/agents never really took the method seriously and in most cases, never get top dollar for their units.
 
As this is a post and not a blog, I will keep it short and concise. To sell for top dollar, you need to understand the below on the psychology of a buyer when they come for viewing:
 
1) Buyers use very little logic when viewing, they tend to follow their emotions more
2) Emotions arise not just from what they see, but also from the other senses such as smell, feel,  touch and hear
3) Sellers always make mistake by assuming that the buyer can imagine an empty house. The buyers don't and they won't
4) The key then is to be able to reach down to the sub-conscious of a buyer by invoking their positive emotions during viewing.  Houses that gets top dollar often make the buyer feel 'right" and they then use their emotion to justify their logic.
 
Failure to consider the above is the key difference between getting no offers (or market valuation at best) and one with a top dollar offer.
 
Understanding the above,here are my 10 tips for sellers based on my experience:
 
1) A cluttered house kills good emotions. Always un-clutter the house before viewing. Throw away junks and keep the house tidy. The owner is selling the house and will need to move soon...use that opportunity to start clearing the house. This issue is so prevalent in many units that the seller  think that the buyer will imagine an empty house. Again they won't!
 
2) Fix all minor defects. Again, too many sellers thinking that the house gonna be sold, what is the point of fixing it up. You don't have to renovate the house, but you should fix up all visible defects. Even a new coat of paint on any old house does miracles in getting good offers
 
3) Clean the kitchen top and uncluttered it. A clean good looking kitchen makes a lot of difference in getting top dollar. If there is one place that make the difference in offers, it is the kitchen. The buyer's wife/gf/mother has a lot of emotions attached to the kitchen and in most cases, they are also the CFO to the purchase.  Unclutter the kitchen top  and make sure the stove and built-in oven looks clean. I even had a seller once storing his microwave away just to clear up space for his very limited kitchen top space. 
 
4) Dining table. Another culprit which is always full of everything except dining stuff. Clear it, and put an attractive piece, a vase with flowers, etc at the center. Pull the buyer eyes to the center of the dining table and let him feel that they can eat comfortably at that table. 
 
5) A well lit, unblock, entrance door. Clear away your shoes or anything untidy at the entrance. An unblock well lit entrance creates eagerness to explore more of your house. 
 
6) Masterbed room is important and it must look like it is ready for relaxation and sleep. I have seen many master bedrooms that has clothes hang in it, or the seller cramped a study table into the master. If you confuse the buyer over the purpose of that room, chances of getting a good offer is as good as nil.
 
7) Always give exclusive to your trusted agent. I seldom see record selling deals that are from open listing.  Open listing agents are prone to be "tested" by the buyer agent and their motivation to close will bring you a lower price. Furthermore exclusive agents are motivated to do every viewing for you hence has minimal viewing leakage.
 
8) Be flexible in your ability to open doors for viewing. Great offers can come from any viewing time and if you restrict your viewing time to evening or weekends only, you are restraining your ability to get good offers, Two of my record breaking sales came from afternoon weekday viewing. Hence, never, never have viewing leakage.
 
9) Check if your house has certain odors especially for those with pets. The houseowner is often immune to any smell, but the buyer will sense it at a distance. And if you have pets that could walk around the house, (or make noise, for.e.g barking) , please bring them out somewhere if you have viewings. Again, please don't assume that the buyer can imagine that your pet won't be there when they make the purchase. They won't. Remember, the sense of smell and hearing invoke powerful emotions so if you want to get top dollar, make sure those senses of the buyer are not affected.
 
10) I leave the last point to the advertising. Good advertising attracts viewers. Unfortunately I've seen many seller/agents use mediocre handphone photos to advertise. Some photos are so bad that a young Instagram-obsessed teen  would probably take better. If you already took the effort to do fix up, unclutter the house, etc, the last thing you want is to have photos that does not depict your house accurately. Wide angle photos, imo, is  the minimal requirement.  Videos and virtual tour are great, but only if your house is of a certain size.  Buyers will sub-consciously drawn to  sellers/agents who take pride in advertising their house and first impression does count in this business. Don't neglect this which I somewhat keep seeing all the time.
 
There are many  more concepts that I can keep going (the use of colours for e.g)  but the above is suffice for most sellers if they want their property to fetch good offers. Infact, I seldom see all 10 points click into place, but if they do, that property should get good offers.  It is very often for me to hear that some units could not be sold for months, but when another agent took over, it get sold within  one month at the same asking price. I don't believe it is all luck.  It has to do with the method right from advertising to preparing the house for sale.
 
I hope the above helps in giving some ideas in getting good offers for your property at your location. Your property is one of your biggest investment so it is worth the effort in putting the right "sciences" into it and get the top dollar offers.
