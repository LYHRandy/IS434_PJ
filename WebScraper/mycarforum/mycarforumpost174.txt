So far, every time our neighbor gives us some 'poisonous' air, I notice the western part of Singapore especially Tuas and Jurong kena the most. That is a no brainer given the fact that area is nearest to where the fire is burning.
 

I brought this up because many property investors that I come across seem not to put that into consideration at all.
 

What do you guys think?

Wah liao, of course NOT my friend. I'm just surprise that most people didn't put that into their list of consideration.
 

Seriously, the foul air is something that can be very harmful. PSI is one thing, at least we can SEE it but PM2.5 is another thing.
 

For those who are not sure what PM2.5 is;
 

Taken from http://www.epa.gov/pmdesignations/faq.htm
 

"Particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5) are referred to as "fine" particles and are believed to pose the greatest health risks. Because of their small size (approximately 1/30th the average width of a human hair), fine particles can lodge deeply into the lungs"

I know him..........but he don't know me 
 

The son of a fishmonger, Peter Lim was educated at the Raffles Institution and obtained a degree in accountancy at the University of Western Australia. Singapore's Sunday Times described him as "publicity shy" and supporting education without seeking the spotlight, having worked as a cab driver, a cook and a waiter during his university days.[3][4]
 

Lim became a stockbroker for mainly Indonesian clients. His successful returns earned him the nickname "Remisier King" (Singapore term for stockbroker).
 

In 1996, he became a fulltime investor, investing $10 million in palm oil producer Wilmar International, now valued at $700 million

aiya.. it's a fact that most ppl dun like to far west...

Some sites there has no takers..

I know of friends that move out from Jurong because they didnt like the air quality..
 

But! with some business activities in the west. There will be bound to have ppl , exec that wants to stay near their workplace in the west. So i guess, from a investment prospective.. it's still good lah.. 
 

But for ppl who has no business to stay there.. they rather stay in the east..

It's pretty true. When I used to be working in Jurong area, the air smells of a mixture of everything

Simi west affected? JE can sell at $1650 psf hor........ 
 
 

SINGAPORE: An upcoming private residential project, J Gateway at Jurong East, looks set to shatter price records for suburban homes.
 
 

According to property agents, the selling price for units ranges between S$1,400 and S$1,650 per square foot.
 
 

J Gateway is tipped to be the "hottest project launch" by property agents, but units will not come cheap.
 
 

According to a marketing mailer from agents, a one-bedroom unit is priced at S$1,650 per square foot. Larger three- and four-bedroom suites cost about S$1,450 psf.
 
 

Analysts said it works out to an average price of about S$1,550 psf for the project - a new benchmark for homes outside core central region.
