I think cap should split...
 
Example:
S$8k - 3rm or above
>S$8 ~10k - 4rm or above
>S$10 ~12k - 5rm or above

I also think its abt time they drop the word 'subsidised' and replace with 'discounted'. It is very irritating everytime to see the phrase 'subsidised public housing'. It is alr an open fact that HDB flats sold direct by HDB is NOT subsidised and is merely just a discounted price compared to the resale mkt and they have ownself admitted it. When the media discuss all issues relating to buying flats direct from hdb, they shld refrain from using the word 'subsidised' which is completely misleading.

They do give grants, so grants is a form of subsidy no? Anyway my engrish very bad, i don't know the difference between subsidy and discount, ultimately i only care about the numbers. When i buy flat i only ask one qns, "How much?"

IMHO....There should not be any cap at all....

We should be able to choose which type of housing we like, regardless of income...
Rich cannot live in HDB?? If I am down to earth type and prefer HDB oso cannot...
Funny cap...
 
Although there are reasons so that the "Rich" will not compete with the so call not so rich for HDB but all of us are sillyporean leh.....

Looking at the first hand 5 - room selling at > 500K, 4 Room for 300K-400K , do you think it is subidised.  My colleague just took his 5 room yesterday at > 500k @ Kim Keat,  I asked him , in future how much you expect to sell in the resale market as 2nd hand    ?
 
 
I used to remember at down town e.g Bukit Purmei , about 15 years back was only... 85K for 4 room and 40K for 3 room flat....
 
I really wonder why this term "subsidised" still here..... it's seems a dinosaur now..

the word 'subsidized' is very misleading now..... HDB is no longer a 'housing plan for the masses'
 
i was so dismayed and disgusted by the latest balloting for mature estates... the prices are OBVIOUSLY not subsidized........ and they are making young families to owe HDB for life

Grants is a form of subsidy which means you can get a subsidy if you want to buy a hdb flat but this does not equate to 'subsidised public housing' becos the flats itself is sold at prices not anywhere close to subsidised prices. Obtaining a subsidy and buying a subsidised flat is two different matter altogether. And furthermore, pls take note that you can only choose either one. Get grant and buy resale or buy direct but no grant. You can't take both grant and buy direct.

No, by right if they want to use the term 'subsidised public housing' the flats have to be sold cheap. If they cannot sell at this kind of prices, then pls refrain from using the word 'subsidised'

After such a long time ever since a reader wrote to ST to question whether hdb flats are subsidised with lots of stats to prove otherwise and with hdb ownself admitting it is just a 'market subsidy' and not real subsidy, the media still persist on using the word 'subsidised' to mislead the public. thinking of writing a letter to ST forum, man..

I would think the following income ceiling changes for direct purchase is realistic:
 
3rm (only singles eligible):  $4500 (up from the usual $3000)
4rm & 5rm: $10000 (up from usual $8000)

I think what u'r trying to say is that the system lack flexibility.
 
Not just that. With an increasing number of senior citizens in our population those enbloc and upgrading programs do not favour them especially to those who had retired and stop working. Not working meaning no income. How on earth to pay for new flat or upgrading? They have no choice but to sell & move and waste money to move.

"subsidised" is one wrong word to use.
 
Another word is "opposition party", which we are brought up with a thinking that any other party been elected into the parliament  would be a opposition party.  
 
In modern times, due to the education level and people are more objective.  So I'm sure not any other party that sit in the parliament would be oppose all the way on policy brought up by ruling party, if it's good.
 
In other countries, they named it as

CPF contribution salary limit is $4500?
So the most they can raise is to $9000.
 
After that there is no gain in the CPF monthly contributions.
Remember the Subsidy/Affordability Theory? Its fixed such that a couple will stuck for the next 30years of their life in Singapore repaying the flat.
 
PLEASE DON"T EVER SUGGEST to raise up the salary mark any higher, since the subsidy is based on the Affordability Level.
If the salary mark is raised up, a higher Affordability outcome will be reached and the subsidy for the flat will be lesser and future HDB flats may have to increase in price to maintian the 30years repayment affordability formula!
The new affordability formular may consider a (Cash-top-up + CPF) monthly repayment figure, instead of the current solely CPF repayment figure for most people!
 
 
Old man has said before that he wished to have stayers and loyal citizens, to create belongings citizens are encouraged to owe(soryy, its own) the flat we stay in. 
I got the suspecting theory that the expensive cars and 10years loan is also part of the master plan to keep loyal citizens planted in Singapore for the long haul!

subsidy means there is actual outlay by party offering subsidy. 
 

in this, there is not outlay. 
 

eg say cost of building hdb flat is 100k, HDB list price it for $400k, then they offer you discount (which they term as subsidy) for $50k.  in such case, since their profit of 300k is > 50k subsidy, there is no outlay.  ie it doesn't jive with the english meaning of subsidy.

They must also know that most pple usually prefer not to live in estates too far away from where they usually live in. Some pple stay in redhill/qtwn/tiong bahru all their life and now when they want to move to another flat, its natural pple will not choose as far as jurong west or sengkang to move to. furthermore, if their parents are staying in this area, din govt encourage the married offsprings to stay close to their parents? how is this going to be inline with wat the govt preach abt forging close family ties if the parents stay in Queenstown and you want the offsprings to move to Sengkang and jurong west?

ok la, rebate or discount both words are still closer to representing the situation rather than subsidy. 
 

rebate --> a return of part of the original payment for some service or merchandise; partial refund.  

(in such case, applicable because purchase from gov at higher price, return part of the price) 

discount -->to offer for sale or sell at a reduced price 

(in such case, applicable because the list price is market price and way above cost and discount given for certain customer profile or demographics) 

subsidy -->a grant or contribution of money 

(in such case not applicable because there is no contribution of money or real outlay.  giving up the opportunity to earn higher profit is not an outlay)

I would think the following income ceiling changes for direct purchase is realistic: 
3rm (only singles eligible):  $4500 (up from the usual $3000)
4rm & 5rm: $10000 (up from usual $8000)

 
This sounds reasonable. Nowadays with fresh grads easily earning slightly under 3K monthly pay, I think its only a matter of around 3 years for them to breach the 4K barrier.

They usually priced their new flats at abt 100K or so lower than what resale mkt is selling...In 2006, they priced new 5rm flats in Queenstown and Tiong Bahru at abt 380-400K..the resale mkt then was selling abt 480-520K for similar type of flats..when the resale market went on a bull run in 2007 and 2008 and hits abt 630-650K avg for 5rm flats in these areas, they also increase their selling prices to abt 500-520k (evident from the recent feb bi monthly sale in mature estate)..

if you really need a flat, and WIS, balloting are unsuccessful, and buying resale flat is beyond the means...then the only way is to move out of the comfort zone and find somewhere else...maybe you can discover and create your own comfort zone...i got friends who stayed in clementi and AMK since they were born and now they moved to tampines, sengkang and punggol.
 
the tendency of singaporeans is not willing to move out of the comfort zone...just look at the economy downturn a few years back where there is lots of retrenchment...ppl just dun willing to lower down expectation in order to have 3 meals and hang on the dream of getting a similar job will similar or higher pay packet

Now new flat already not enuf for sporean. If it raise, it will worsen the problem. More ppl will join into this grp of "homeless" to buy a new flat
 
The homeless people are those who exceed the 8K mark by a bit and cannot buy hdb but also resist buyng condo due to high price of condo. 
 
U really think 8K is alot, can easily afford condo? If salary 8K go buy condo, will be repaying high installment month after month for the rest of their working lives and beyond, end up like slaves to the banks. This is like 8K combine income go buy a Porsche, can buy, who say cannot buy, but eat grass every month forever lor.

If you work in the west and your parents stay in the west, trust me, you will not say this. HDB shld plan the building of flats according to the demographics..the increase in numbers of flats being built shld go according to demand in each of the different areas so as to cater to pple wanting to stay close to where their parents lived and where they used to stay. They have been building lots of flats in north east areas like Punggol and Sengkang in recent times but have not been doing this for estates in the west and central west. The examples which you quoted are rare and few. Talk to most pple and the housing agents and you would realise most pple(at least over 80%) tend not to relocate too far away from where they used to stay.

FYI, I did manage to create my own comfort zone by going for something different and yet not moving too far away from where I used to say. and you have also not address on the issue on govt saying they encourage singaporeans to stay near their parents and yet they keep asking pple who stay far away from sengkang/punggol to move to sengkang/punggol. 
 
Why is it there is only two BTOs in the whole of central and south west Singapore being announced in the last 4 yrs and meanwhile plenty of such projects are being announced for Sengkang/Punggol in the same amount of time? There are clearly not enough flats to go around in certain areas and some areas there is over supply. This is poor planning.

Hmm, if u refering to new flats, difficult to get flat is because of short supply, HDB fault. Cannot blame it on so called "competition", because every Sillyporeans is entitled to get a flat in Spore, u and everyone else.
 

Agree that its HDB's failure to plan and cater for demand, and slow to respond. 
 

Current situation is such that the pie is already very small, by raising the income ceiling would worsen the situation. Those lower income family would be squeeze out, and overall price I think would increase much more. 
 

I think sooner or later will need to revised the ceiling upward, but the supply must be at certain comfortable level before doing so.

Not sure why HDB is concentrating on the north-east area when building new units, such as ponggol and senkang. This will result in traffic congestion during peak hours, and hence come ERP. 
 

Do you think people working in other end of S'pore, such as Tuas, would consider the north-east area if given other option? Who would volunteer to move out of their comfort zone into the uncomfortable zone?

the word 'subsidized' is very misleading now..... HDB is no longer a 'housing plan for the masses'
 
i was so dismayed and disgusted by the latest balloting for mature estates... the prices are OBVIOUSLY not subsidized........ and they are making young families to owe HDB for life

They do give grants, so grants is a form of subsidy no? Anyway my engrish very bad, i don't know the difference between subsidy and discount, ultimately i only care about the numbers. When i buy flat i only ask one qns, "How much?"
 
Subsidized is selling below cost. Discounted is selling below retail price (and STILL above cost, ie earn less)
 
Grants given by HDB goes to first timers who choose to buy a resale flat from the open market insteasd of direct from HDB. Since HDB sells flats at 'subsidized' prices, the grants are to pass on this 'subsidy' to these first time buyers.
 
But now if we understand that the 'subsidy' is actually a discount, then the grants aren't really subsidies either ...

the next moment everyone KPKB about the 8k cap.

 
Actually, it's inflation and NOT enough money. Value of money is now very low. That's why a couple with combined income of 8K is not that well off enough to afford private housing ...

the value of money is very low.
but perhaps there is many people here that is drawing much more then 8k bah.
 
i think they are aiming the more then 8k people rather then those 8k zhun zhun.
 
those 8k~8.5k dollars one are the really sway one.

is a never ending story...then those who earn 13, 14, or even 15k...u think they can afford to buy condo ??? best is to scrapped this cap for first timer 
 
because there are some who are super hao lian - combine income 8 k only say hdb flat too cheap no privacy no class and die die burden with heavy loan to buy condo. likewise those with combine income of 15k might not think they can afford condo if they have to support their parents and in law.

Grants is a form of subsidy which means you can get a subsidy if you want to buy a hdb flat but this does not equate to 'subsidised public housing' becos the flats itself is sold at prices not anywhere close to subsidised prices. Obtaining a subsidy and buying a subsidised flat is two different matter altogether. And furthermore, pls take note that you can only choose either one. Get grant and buy resale or buy direct but no grant. You can't take both grant and buy direct.
 
to be fair, buy direct still cheaper than buy resale with grant.

No to upping $8,000 income cap for 1st-time HDB buyers 
By Lynn Lee 
[/size] 
THE HOUSING Board will not raise the $8,000 income ceiling for first-time HDB flat buyers, despite numerous calls by MPs and the public to revise it. 
National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan told Parliament on Thursday that the current income criteria captures some 8 in 10 Singaporean families, including upper-middle income ones. 
'I hope members will agree with me that this is more than generous and will not be surprised if I tell them that HDB has no plans to revise the income ceiling,' said Mr Mah. 
His response came three days after MPs like Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah GRC) pointed out that families earning more than $8,000 were stuck - as they were unable to purchase new homes, and yet could not buy them in the resale marke because of the runaway prices. 
Mr Mah acknowledged that HDB resale prices had seen a 'heady' growth of about 17 per cent last year. 
But he did not think this trend would continue and drew attention to other affordable alternatives. 
For instance, families who exceed the income ceiling could turn to resale Executive flats. 
Mr Mah also assured Singaporeans that the Government would ensure that HDB flats remained within the reach of the vast majority of Singaporeans, especially young couples looking to buy their first home. 
For instance, they will get more chances in balloting exercises for new flats. 
Mr Mah said the Government had spent an average of $1.4 billion a year over the last five years on public housing. 
For the 2008 financial year, it was setting aside $1.6 billion as part of efforts to cater to Singaporeans' housing needs.

The people has spoken, and the govt has turned a deaf ear (again). Time for the people to take action in next election.
But if raising the income ceiling, some of the less fortunate citizen will be hit....
Real problem is not the income ceiling too low, but that the HDB prices too high...
 
Raising HDB income ceiling will hurt needy 
 
I REFER to Saturday's letter, 'HDB ceiling doesn't factor in late marriages'. Ms Xu Zhilin says the $8,000 income ceiling doesn't consider the trend among Singaporeans of marrying late, resulting in a combined income that is slightly higher because they have worked for a few years. However, this ignores the point that there are many lower-income people in need of HDB housing, and Ms Xu is not alone in looking for a roof to start a family. 
 
The critical factor in buying a flat is not how late you marry but how much you can afford to pay. 
As one whose household income is half of hers, I have to say that if people like Ms Xu were allowed to enter the HDB market, prices would rise even further, putting housing out of reach of low-income earners. 
The current rule is that four-room household incomes should be between $4,000 and $8,000. 
I do not see why Ms Xu, with her $9,000-plus income, wants to compete in the market against a household earning half her income. 
The same low-income people also face her stated problems of refurbishment and paying more for a resale flat, only their problems are double hers as they have half her income. 
Prices of four-room flats now range from $200,000 to $300,000. If someone earning $4,000 a month must fork out $300,000 for a flat, there is little reason why someone earning $9,000 cannot afford a $600,000 flat. 
Most people take 20 to 30 years to pay for their HDB flat. With Ms Xu's income, she could probably pay for it in half the time, sell it for a profit, and move into private housing. 
Ms Xu may not be a high flier, but having reached this level, her income is less likely to be static and thus she will have more options to move into private housing later. But incomes of the less well off are more likely to be static, giving them fewer prospects to move up. Where will they go when flat prices rise? 
Ms Xu says she will have to spend the rest of her life either paying $100,000 more for an old flat or paying for a private condominium or executive flat. I say welcome to the real world.

Like that ah? If LTA say those who earn more than $8K can only buy 2.4L and bigger cars, how? Or those who earn >$8K cannot eat at hawker centers and coffeeshops. Or cannot take economy class in planes. 
 
This is like saying you are not allowed to be thrifty in Singapore because u earn >$8K! U earn more, u better make sure u spend more, spend spend spend until no $ for retirement, work until 80yo and die broke! Earn $4k, work until 80yo and die broke, earn $9K, also forced to work until 80yo and die broke, what sort of crap policy is this. If flats is too expensive, HDB can MAKE IT CHEAPER FOR EVERYONE. That's what the $6.4 billion budget surplus can be used for, SUBSIDISE the flats until back to 1980s price, <$100K.

That is a disgusting act, but are they representing the majority? How many people do you know of that do that? I understand where u coming from, but how is textbooks the same as HDB?
 
Unlike the free textbooks which is meant to help the needy, HDB housing was never meant to be affordable housing for the POOR only meaning it's not built with intention to help the needy, it's suppose to be affordable housing for the PEOPLE, that means everyone with pink ic. But now seems like it's becoming affordable housing for CERTAIN PEOPLE. What's your take on this?
 
 
Think about it, when a family earns >$8K, do they automatically become 2nd class citizen in the eyes of HDB? Are they less of a Singapore citizen than families with <$8K income? 
 
They don't get extra previleges as citizens because they >$8K right, eg, can i say my family earn >$8K so I no need reservist, my kids no need NS, I can smoke in a/c in public, etc? To the govt, the $10K guy is the same as the $1K guy, so why HDB double standard?

Actually got some loop hole... They judge cap by "salary - income". 
Ppl who are multi-millionaire with monthly huge interest generated (nowadays interest no need report income tax) but "salary" is low can also buy...  

 
Right... this is the biggest problem in determining "wealth" just by looking at salary. You must also look at whether the salary-earner is single, married with no kids, married with kids, married with kids and aged parents, and many, many other combinations that may deplete his wealth despite having a relatively large income.

No problem, this thread just for discussion sake, everyone can share their opinion and we need not agree with each other opinion to have a discussion.
 
Yes, we have bursaries to help the needy, we have subsidies to help the needy, etc. But HDB is to help the needy? Since when? HDB is formed to make sure all singaporeans can have a roof (HDB roof in this case), so why is my arguement invalid? U still never answer my question which u claimed to be invalid: "Is HDB meant only for the needy, yes or no"? If your answer is yes, then i suggest HDB no more balloting, but start allocating flats to the lowest income group first <1K, then <2K then <3k and so on. Why ballot? Is for the needy mah, just like the text books. If your answer is no, then why the hell they have a cap? U mean they put a cap to prove your point that the world is not fair? Sorry but they need a better reason than that.

Your this post coming from the gahment sources and another coming from other gahment sources about pay scales are directly contridictory in nature.
 
So on one hand, they are indicating that ppl are earning more generally and seem like the $5k/mth thing I posted was a water shed amount...but on the other, on what % of earners are rated based on their pay scale, they say you are rather 'well off' and fall within the top 20+% of top earners if you can make $5K/mth.
 
So if top earners live in HDB subsided housing where do middle and low earners live?

 Looks like a move to push the 8k-10k income family to buy ECs .... or the 750K 5rm Cityview units 

I read in another forum that the Boon Keng DBSS has started selection this week. Some of the applicants gave up when their turn to select, because after reconsiderating the $$$, not worth it/CMI...
 
 
When someone gives up, others will take their place. 
 
 
There's always another sucker in line....
 
How come no news/report on the Boon Keng DBSS selection results? Didn't read anything on the newspaper or TV news, not as hot as compared to the first DBSS in Tampinese.... I hear now they are moving to the 2nd batch which was not selected initially....
 
I am really wonder how many people actually book the DBSS flat at Boon Keng.
 
Same as the HDB BTO, they always like to say how many time over-subscribed, but they never tell us how many % was taken up. I think HDB also said some of the BTO at Puggol only about 60% take up rate. 
 
But not reporting the BTO take up rate and instead emphasize more on how many X over-subscribed, the media and HXX are trying to create a illusion that the property market is super HOT

Singapore HDB 40 Years at a Glance
 
The Housing & Development Board was formed on 1 February 1960 as a statutory body responsible for Singapore's public housing programme. Since its establishment, HDB has played an important role in the development of Singapore.
 
HDB's objective in the early years was to build low-cost housing for low-income Singaporeans to tackle the massive housing shortage inherited from the colonial government. Moving into the seventies, it concentrated on improving housing standards and encouraging home ownership. In the eighties, it set out to build, not just homes, but communities in self-contained towns. In the nineties and beyond, the challenge is for HDB to respond to aspirations for a better quality lifestyle, one that will continue to remain affordable and innovative.
 
HDB today is no longer a mere provider of basic shelter. It is committed to housing that can meet the needs and aspirations of a more affluent and modern generation. Singaporeans are now looking for quality housing and services in an environment that supports and enhances their lifestyle. HDB has gone about meeting these expanding needs and aspirations by setting high standards and harnessing technology and ingenuity. The awards and accolades it has received testify to its capacity and ability to surmount the challenges coming its way.
 
The HDB of tomorrow faces new challenges as new housing needs will surface in the future - keeping up with the needs of a younger generation as well as caring for an aging society. By coming up with new housing forms and taking fresh approaches to town planning and development, HDB has already prepared for these challenges. In the future, as in the past, HDB will continue to innovate to cater for the housing needs of different groups of Singaporeans and to help make Singapore the Best Home for all.(source:thinkquest.org)

There is no discrimination for anyone who earns more or less although if you are making lots of $$, I dun think they will ask you back for reservist.

Hmm.... Here's my take. 
 
I think the crux here is that there's a lot of people who feel that the $8K ceiling is no longer a realistic figure. A $8K household income 10yrs back (mainly single income) and now $8K (mainly double imcome) paints a very different picture of the average 'qualifying' household. In short, the ceiling is not keeping up with the times and changes in society to represent the original group of people who were the actual target population.
 
I also think the reation from the people is that HDB had always projected an image that it's affordable public houseing for ALL citizens, but with the 'outdatedness' of the criteria, it seems to be discriminating those households who just happen to just cross over the $8K mark, but who find it a financial strain to take up higher interest rates housing loans
 
Off topic: actually, we do pay the same tax rates. It's the respective amounts in the differnt tax brackets that determine how much more one pays over another (ie, my first 30K taxable income is the same as your first 30K...)

So seems like those household >$8K is not within one of the so called different groups. 
 
"Best Home for all." ALL??????
 
 
Even if u earn >200K annual also u will be called back. U never see reservist drive porshe, Z5, big BMW and Merc to camp before? I see often.

Boleh land govt have policies that takes care of the people, which is something i admire. Here, our govt keep emphasizing we should not be a welfare state. Sure, no welfare state, fine, but what the hell is wrong with increasing the $8K cap after 14 long years? 14 years ago a plate of chicken rice is $1.50.

I knew you would definitely catch that word. I was hoping you would read the whole article.
 
For the sake of discussion, read the part "In the future". No point playing with words right? 
 
The ceiling is there for a reason. Today, HDB is using the resale market to solve this 8K problem. On a serious note, I agree with one bro concerning the price of HDB today, it is simply too high. It is crazy to build public housing so close to the CBD because th land cost is too expensive.
 
My neighbour bought his 5-rm unit at only 177K about 5yrs back when WIS is trying to lelong our all those remaining unsold units.
 
The resale flats are expensive today due to the property bubble. Once it burst, there will be plenty of cheap flats and private properties for sale. I am sure if BK was launch then, it won't dare to sell its unit as today's price.
 
Unfortunately, today the resale market is the only solution for those that are stuck between 8K - infinity. Or maybe HDB can sell the flats to those >8K but loan from private bank, would that be fair? No, if you ask me. Who don't want to have the best of everything?
 
Your range of >200k is relative. Do you know anyone who earns more than 500K annual being called in for reservist?

there needs to be a cap because singapore housing policy is based on "affordability", that is, based on household income, 30-50% is used to pay the monthly installment for a 30 year loan.
 
e.g. at 8k, 40%x$8000=$3200pm
 
If the Principle loan is $350,000, then by the 197th month, you would have cleared the debt, from 198th to 360th month, you pay an additional $283,487.
 
Anybody can see if this number is reasonable? I just hantum excel to calculate nia.

If less than 10K should be able to buy EA right?
 
8K is the combined income. Your friend cannot apply if he alone has hit the limit.
 
I don't quite understand your 2nd question but I will try to answer.
 
It is a combined income of 8K from both applicants. Dun think can apply by one party.

yeah. 14 years ago:
 
1. Our employers contribute 20% to CPF
2. There was no GST
3. There was no COE
4. There was no ERP
5. Families were mainly single income
6. $600K annual salary is not peanuts
 
Or is the government in-directly admitting that the income gap is that big and that there's such a BIG pool in the lower income bracket now?

Unless his wifey not working then can apply new EA.
 
Personally I was thinking of downgrading to 3 room with my wife and only daughter until my friend advised me to rent the flat out. Now deciding which agents to work with.
 
Will move back to parent's 4 room.
