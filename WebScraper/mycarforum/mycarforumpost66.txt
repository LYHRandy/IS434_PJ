Under the Residential Property Act, developers are required to pay an Additional Buyer Stamp Duty (ABSD) of 10 percent for land bought after December 2011 and 15 percent for land acquired after January 2013. 
 
But the government will waive the fee if they agree to build, complete and then sell all their units within a stipulated period, namely four years for executive condominiums (ECs) and five years for private residential properties.
 
So the deadline starts from Dec 2016 onwards.
 
Fast forward to 2016.   The imposed deadline is now 1 year away.  Developers that did not managed to sell all their units face a grim prospect of paying a hefty penalty. 
 
The following are the residential properties whose land was acquired from Dec 2011 till Sep 2012.  If these developments are not fully sold, will the developers cut prices for those unsold units this year? 
 
For those in the know, if you are aware of those developments that are fully sold, please update me.

No matter what they do, it will just be the lesser evil.
 
Smart business people know better than to hold on and pay levies.
 
Not everyone has a leasing arm and even if they do, its not the best thing to over carry inventory.
Aging property and low rents plus tax is obviously not the winning formula for developers.  
 
Woooohooooo happy new year

There is already a stirring from the developers last year.  They know the inevitable is coming, but our government is standing firm.
 
 
THE government has rebuffed calls by some developers to extend the five-year deadline for them to complete a residential project and sell all its units - part of a slew of property cooling measures introduced in recent years

I kinda stand by the govt (for once) on this...the developers, both local n foreign, especially the latter, been too aggressive with their land bids. 
 
Market forces were great with the influx of hot monies...retracted substantially now with the clampdown in the middle Kingdom as well as redeployment of cash back to the land of dreams. 
 
Local investors n genuine homeowners often have to succumb to the market forces at play.
Govt role is to be there to instrument a balance. If the greedy sellers can't chew more than it can take pls do the masses a favour n let the prices come to a sensible equilibrium. 
 
衣食住行 - govt is having a tough time coping with the last 3...they are more geared towards creating a best biz hub in the region to keep us employed to handle all 4 on our own.   
 
But, pap, please ensure the efficiency of the public transport system b4 I give up my coe for the newly formed family to go for a family car...

The developers have turned cautious, after bidding aggressively in 2010-2012, as the government introduced cooling measures to put a stop to rising prices of properties.
 
I have been monitoring land sales in the Alexandra Road area.  Developers are now more restrained in their biddings.  A case in point:
 
A land sales (Alexandra View Parcel A), just next to the Redhill MRT, attracted a top bid of $851 psf ppr, in Nov 2015.   I am watching to see what is the average selling price for this property.  It will set the benchmark for the rest of the properties around the area.

I am monitoring those properties (launched late 2011 -  Sep 2012) that are not fully sold, and is going to hit the 5-year deadline.  
 
For those launched last year, the deadline for these developers is till a long way ahead.

their target price is prob 1480-1700psf based on abt 20% margin before tax. 1480psf for large units n 1700psf for 1 bedder.
 
knowing FEO itll b mostly 1 bedder at 1700psf n some micro 2 bedders which r investors fav

Yes, the numbers are mind-boggling.  
 
Bargains are coming soon late 2016 onwards.  Some developers will have to 'show hand' and cut prices..  Prepare your cash and get ready to go in for the 'kill' when the opportunity comes.
 
Success to all our bros here!

I absolutely refuse to believe there is any oversupply
 
until I see prices fall substantially.
 
The only reason prices are not going up faster
 
is due to cooling measures.
 
If the CMs are removed I can see prices
 
sky rocketing.
 
Btw I am not a property salesman.

Given our government enviable track record of maximizing revenue, it is in all probability that most of the property cooling measures, except perhaps the TDSR, will be progressively relaxed before the deadline. 
 
Remember the government priority is land sale revenue, as well as to hold the primary market HDB pricing -- $300 psf for suburban area, and up to $700 psf for more central locality like kallang.
 
Unfortunately, it will be proven too late by the time the government reacts, as everyone will be sitting on the sidelines admist the rising force selling by the banks.
 
The timing is just perfect to coincide with the 10 year global financial crisis in 2017/2018.  By then TDSR will also be scrapped, and all private property owners will be encouraged to participate in resale HDB market.

if DPS is back, it wld mean that SG prop wldve been falling for 3-4yrs already. so far prime has fallen for 2yrs already,...
 
1998 the sg prop mkt crashed all d way till 2003, which was when DPS was intro.

Ah Duck,
Someone who does not want to graciously admit that his view/position is wrong will anchor the most extreme situation on the flip side to debate.
CMs and DPS are on opposite ends of the scale, as we know.
 
Such argument simply hold no water any further. (Well it never did before either)

They all die die will not drop prices. At the most, they hold the psf constant. Some of the smaller ones with small inventory will set up a100% owned SG private arm and sell to it to avoid the penalty.

If developer sells to a private SG company - that company is considered a buyer and will incur the ABSD as well.  There is simply no escape from paying money to the government.

well... then it cld keep for 4yrs till past ABSD, n likely within next 4yrs got chance of remove ABSD too.
 
or... they sell it to a commercial entity, then flip the SPV to another commercial entity... which usually attracts the low sale of shares duty... then sell a few more times to a few more cayman BVI SPVs then back to same owner in SG? hahaha dun quote me on this...

Yes "Only" 3%.  
 
Lets see, eg. 20units at a million each X 3% = $600,000 = peanuts
 
And the units are still not sold to public yet !

by right the final beneficiary is still the developer so even if developer forms new coy IRAS will see who owns the coy. All the developer needs to own is 1% of new coy n he will kena ABSD. or else everyone will b forming coys to escape ABSD.
 
only way is to layer the transactions with alot of offshore SPVs which are hard to track... lol...

agent can flip by selling lower than market price (at least will not damage developer name lelong) or manage as leasing apartment ...

if any other developer bid $851, selling price prob $1,400 psf plus minus
 
but if it is FEO, then u can be sure it will be no $1600 no talk

when time is nearing, won't be surprised if there is extension. easy to justify esp if economic growth is low, technical recession blah blah
 
i better dont speak so much abt developers, cos i am going to join one. tired of being a cowboy, better seek refuge with the big boys

Singapore private home prices fall 3.7% in 2015, at slower pace than in 2014: URA flash data

SINGAPORE - Private home prices fell at a slower pace last year than in 2014, according to flash estimates from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) on Monday (Jan 4).
Prices were down an estimated 0.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year, taking the full year decline to 3.7 per cent. In 2014, prices fell 4.0 per cent during the year.
The fourth quarter's estimated price decline was also the smallest across the nine straight quarters of price decline in URA's property price index.

Too soon to say Singapore private home price declines are slowing down: Experts

Prices are now about 8.4 per cent below their recent peaks in the third quarter of 2013.
According to the estimates, prices of non-landed private homes in the core central region fell 0.4 per cent in the fourth quarter, while prices of those in the city fringes and suburbs were unchanged.
 
 
For the whole of 2015, prices in core central region, city fringes and suburbs fell by 2.6 per cent, 3.9 per cent and 3.7 per cent respectively.
Prices of landed properties fell 2.1 per cent in the fourth quarter and were down 4.4 per cent for the whole of 2015.
The flash estimates are compiled based on transaction prices given in contracts submitted for stamp duty payment and survey data on new units sold by developers during the first 10 weeks of the quarter.
The statistics will be updated four weeks later when URA releases the full real estate statistics for the fourth quarter of 2015, which captures more data from the stamp duty records and the take-up of new projects.
"Past data have shown that the difference between the quarterly price changes indicated by the flash estimate and the actual price changes could be significant when the change is small. The public is advised to interpret the flash estimates with caution," the URA said.

First it was leaning on the Hope of the Govt to lift CMs 
 
Now, it's leaning on the hope of Govt putting their foot in their mouth by either extending dates or scrapping some of these policies.
 
 
Good thing you seeking refuge like you said.  
 
Heeeehheeeeeee.

Prices were down an estimated 0.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year, taking the full year decline to 3.7 per cent. In 2014, prices fell 4.0 per cent during the year.
The fourth quarter's estimated price decline was also the smallest across the nine straight quarters of price decline in URA's property price index.

Prices are now about 8.4 per cent below their recent peaks in the third quarter of 2013.
According to the estimates, prices of non-landed private homes in the core central region fell 0.4 per cent in the fourth quarter, while prices of those in the city fringes and suburbs were unchanged.
 
 
For the whole of 2015, prices in core central region, city fringes and suburbs fell by 2.6 per cent, 3.9 per cent and 3.7 per cent respectively.
Prices of landed properties fell 2.1 per cent in the fourth quarter and were down 4.4 per cent for the whole of 2015.
The flash estimates are compiled based on transaction prices given in contracts submitted for stamp duty payment and survey data on new units sold by developers during the first 10 weeks of the quarter.
The statistics will be updated four weeks later when URA releases the full real estate statistics for the fourth quarter of 2015, which captures more data from the stamp duty records and the take-up of new projects.
"Past data have shown that the difference between the quarterly price changes indicated by the flash estimate and the actual price changes could be significant when the change is small. The public is advised to interpret the flash estimates with caution," the URA said.

 
Fall so little, no problem lah, can let it fall another 10-15% going into 2016-2017-2018 lah

Oh wow, back in mid 2013, i said we are reaching the peak of the property cycle and sold my property,  few people believed me.   Going into 2014, people continue to say that the peak wasnt in 2013..
 
So now suddenly the same people who refuse to believe that 2013 was the peak, are now reporting that the peak is 3rd qtr 2013......
 
So glad, i am vindicated.

anyway, singapore developers are the most pai tan industry. govt always sympathise with them (after all, most of the time when developers are screwed is when they pay govt hefty over valued GLS land)
 
when time is nearing, won't be surprised if there is extension. easy to justify esp if economic growth is low, technical recession blah blah
 
i better dont speak so much abt developers, cos i am going to join one. tired of being a cowboy, better seek refuge with the big boys

Let me guess, your friends are buying all the mass market type of properties ?
 
Similar to cat A COE, becos there are so many people after mass market stuff, it actually is more resilient than the good prime stuff.   But in terms of dollar value, 10 mickey mouse = 1 good solid condo.

Dont like that say, many people here look at $5mil upwards.
But the point is that you dont get good value from mass market stuff.

Hawker centre food is no good cos mass market stuff?
 
But I keep seeing you post hawker centre food you pi, you qi, you hou le???
 
I must be seeing things.
 
Anyway, the things I most enjoy about SG are mostly mass market in nature. The more mass market, the better. I guess it's a culture ingrained in me from young. My father once told me cheap shoes are the best because every month you can buy new shoes without feeling the pinch. I do not fully agree with him but much of my thoughts stemmed from what he once told me.

These developments are those whose land sales are awarded from Dec 2011 to Sep 2012, hence the 5-year deadline is nearer.  For those properties from Oct 2012 onwards, we can discuss about them later, as their developers are not as hard-pressed as the former.

Property developers are resilient too.  Buyers, sellers, waiting to see who blink will first.
 
In Straits Times today, C2 business page, it is stated "Conclusion: We may be in January, but buckle up for the rest of the year, it's going to be a painful ride."  
 
Yes, but for who?  Surely not those who are waiting at the sideline to go into the property market.  They are in for a fun ride!  Also not  for genuine home owners who are not selling. 
 
It is a painful ride for those property investors......

landlords will survive a 10% vacancy lah, no need to fear so much

For the rich in MCF, super fantastic discount, only for selected projects
 
let me know if you want to buy some of these. i can help u get an extra 1% off from the developer.

My Porsche was bought way before selling a property at record peak price in 2013.
My Rolexes, i have been buying since long ago. 
My cash and profit mostly in investments or in the bank.

Besides the ABSD rule, there is another rule that will penalise the developers.
 
"Any units still unsold two years after a project's completion face an "extension charge," of 8% of the proportional land cost for the first year, rising to 16% in the second year and 24% in the third year.  This is applicable if the developer has a foreign shareholder".   This means all the public listed developers like City Development, Capital Land, Wing Tai, etc, fall under this category (because as long as 1 foreigner holds 1,000 shares of the developer's company, it is considered foreign holding).
 
Unlike the ABSD rule which the developers have no way to avoid (Some bros here have suggested setting up an investment company to buy over the remaining units.  It does not help; the investment company pays the ABSD instead of the developer, why bother to set up in the first place?), there is a way to avoid paying the extension charge, that is, to de-list the company (make it private, hence zero foreign holdings).  However, it is not cheap to delist.
 
Developments to be affected by this rule include:
Urban Resort
Interlace
d'Leedon
Nouvel 18
Le Nouvel Ardmore
Ardmore 3
TwentyOne Agullia Park

An interim update.
 
First private property (under the HDB land sales) to face the ABSD penalty at the end of 2016 is possibly "The Trilinq".  Out of 755 units, about 221 units have been sold (based on Edge Property  website info).
 
First private property (under the URA land sales) to face the ABSD penalty at the end of 2016 is possibly "Echelon" (I am not sure if its land sales is awarded before or after the ABSD cooling measure was imposed in Dec 2011).  3 very expensive penthouses ($7 million upwards each) are still unsold (see Property Guru).
 
The developer for Echelon should be able to avoid the ABSD penalty (calculated based on purchased land costs, not the number of unsold units) by buying over the 3 penthouses easily.
 
However, to do the same, the developer of 'The Trilinq' is going to face a massive buy-over costs for the remaining units.

http://www.propersquare.com/reviews/details/the-trilinq#.Vun8zWdf3IU
 
The conclusion from the review is not flattering. 
 
Quote from the review:
 
We found Trilinq to be very pricey, relative to its neighbours. We were hoping to discover something truly outstanding to justify the cost, but couldnt quite find it.
All in all, we were disappointed in the execution: It felt rather mass market.

Property analysts had estimated a breakeven cost of $854 to $974 psf ppr for Trilinq.  So the developer, from Malaysia, has a big leeway to reduce prices without hurting its profit margin, but it is not doing so, just yet.
 
For a development outside the central region (OCR), the pricing is way too high.  At best, it should be priced around $1,000 to $1,100 psf at current market sentiments.

i looked at the brochure in 2014 (brought back by my sis) and thought that whoever bought this place needs to have their head checked.
It's noisy, the traffic around the area is bad, blocks are cramped, there was ludricious amounts of space wasted on mega balconies and multiple AC ledges, the location is somewhat close to the MRT but still a good walk away and to top it all off, its very expensive for the area.

In other words, this development is somewhat doomed.......The ABSD penalty that it has to pay, in Jan 2017, is $40,800,080 (10% of land costs), if it cannot find buyers for all the unsold units.  
 
I sense that the developer will have to cut prices massively to entice buyers for the remaining unsold units. 
 
Let the countdown begins: 9 months+ from today.....

Today, Nouvel 18 is in my spotlight.  A freehold development, 156 units.  Next to Raffles Girls' Secondary School.  A prime area.  Already TOP.  The curious thing about this development:  It is 100% unsold! Because it is not launched yet!
 
If the developer does nothing until Nov 2016, guess what happens?  It has to pay the government $38M in extension charges (QC charges)!

Developer is CapitaLand. There are 95 unsold units out of a total of 694 units.  Developer is dangling a 6% discount (compared to launch prices) across the board for all unit types.   Prices start from $821,000, $1.1 million and $1.6 million for the 1-bedder, 2-bedder and 3-bedder, respectively.
 
This development's ABSD deadline is in Dec 2017. 
 
 
'Bargains' properties that I have posted so far:
 
16 Mar Posting
The Trilinq - potentially paying a hefty ABSD of $40M in 2017 (524 unsold out of 755).
1 Apr Posting
Nouvel 18 - potentially paying $38M in Nov 2016 (156 unsold out of 156)

Bro, you are providing good "charitable" services to the community here. 
 
But these are hardly "bargain" properties even though they are at different end of the spectrum.
 
Much depends on whether these developers have "gao gao" bottomline and be able to get around this through various means.
 
Nouvel 18 is a different kettle of fish bec they cater to a different market. They can negotiate for private block sales and "sell" to their subsidaries etc
 
Sky Vue only 10% left, so the stress is not that high for them. They will move some units with discounts but prices are not at "Lelong" level.
 
Drove past Newton26 the other day and it looks TOP from outside. Think only 30 out of 180 units sold. This one may have some potential stress level bec dont think one of the big boys own this. Does it have a ABSD dateline?

Every day I read in MCF property market has crashed since 2013
 
Then I come here and look for bargains and read
 
all the properties on sale are over priced.
 
How can it be crashed and still over priced?

Did anyone mentioned it there is a crash landing somewhere?!
 
The big Bosses said the market has "landed softly" under "controlled conditions"
 
So softly in fact no one has noticed it has ever landed 
 
But the Experts say it will be flying sideways with downward drift.
 
Unlikely to crash any time soon.

I think can still refer but differentiate between factual versus emotional responses.
 
For example, if I made a mistake or error in what was shared, I would accept responsibility and apologise for misleading and not blame any other person / groups.

26 Newton is a freehold development as a result of a collective sale in Mar 2011.  It does not have a ABSD deadline (imposed only on land sales from Dec 2011 onwards).  The developer, Novelty Corp, seems to be a 100% locally-owned company, which implies that no QC (applicable for developer with foreign holdings) is needed.
 
In other words, this development is untouchable.  It can take its own sweet time to sell all its units without any monetary penalty. 
 
Current status:
Recently obtained TOP.  Total units 160.  60 units launched.  33 units sold. 
 
PSF price range of transactions done so far: Low of $2,119 psf (807 sq ft unit) to High of $2,653 psf (614 sq ft unit).   
 
Most of the 33 units sold are 1-bedder.

paterson collection

 
Paterson Collection is a freehold development, consisting of 85 units.  The expected buyers are the very rich people, as this development is in a very prime area, and consists only large-sized units of 3-bedder, 4-bedder and penthouses.
 
The developer is Bukit Sembawang View.  It obtained TOP in  2015.  The parent company, Bukit Sembawang Estates, made a provision loss of $17.5M in its 2014 annual report.
 
This is a property that you cannot walk in and buy, simply because it is not launched yet, in view of poor market sentiments.

Thanks for the great work in educating.
 
Now I am indeed curious. How many units of the intended (touted) supply from 2016-2018 are subject to QC and ABSD? How many are not and can be deferred for years?
 
The figure will inform about the actual supply versus the touted supply. It has huge implications on final price determination.

How can it be crashed and still over priced?
 
 

 
Please don't believe what people say in the forum, when the official facts are otherwise so far:
 
 
Private property prices (published by URA) since the peak in 2013.
2014 - 4% drop
2015 - 3.7% drop
 
In late 2013, after the latest cooling measure was imposed in mid-2013, property analysts were predicting and expecting a 10% drop in property prices for 2014.  It did not happen.
 
When I created this thread, "New Bargains to be had?" in Jan 2016, the intent is to let people be aware of 2 punitive penalties facing most property developers, the 5-year ABSD deadline, and the QC extension premiums.  To avoid these 2 penalties, the developers might have to drop prices to move sales.  
 
Notice that the thread ends with a question mark.  In other words, I have no certainty that the developers will drop prices (they absorb the penalties), but if they do, the bros here can get a good deal (i.e. bargains).  I don't expect a lelong sale (many bros have too high an expectation here), though (developers are still answerable to their shareholders as well as not to be seen to 'spoil the market'). 
 
I know that T2 in this property forum is shouting down for the property market to go down.  I think there is a good chance that some bargains can be had, especially for those developers who have small % of unsold units on their hands; it is better to get rid of them at discounted prices, instead of paying the ABSD, and 2 years later, pay the QC extensions premiums (if applicable).
 
In the near future, things might change.  You never know.  If the world's economies start picking up, Singapore, currently a laggard in property market vis-a-vis the other hot property markets like in Hong Kong, London, Sydney, Melbourne, etc, will start playing to catch up.

I have posted this before in the other thread, "Private property prices... Up or Down?"  Let me duplicate it here as well.
 
The developer's ABSD is applicable for land sales conducted from Dec 2011 onwards.  The condition is that after 5 years from the date of the land sales, if there are remaining unsold units, the developer has to pay 10% (revised to 15% for land purchased from Jan 2013 onwards) of the land costs it paid for.
 
Developer with foreign holdings (e.g. public-listed companies) have to obtain a QC and there is a 2-year deadline after TOP to sell all unsold units, failing which extension premiums have to be paid.  The premiums are calculate at the per annum rates of 8% of the land purchase price for the first year, 16% for the second, and 24% for the third/subsequent years of extension, pro-rated based on how many unsold units are left.
 
HDB Land Sales in 2012 (ABSD deadlines in 2017)

 
URA Land Sales in 2012 (ABSD deadlines in 2017)

 
I hope this clarifies.

Went to see Trilinq early 2015. Very basic interior finishing. Nothing special.
Exterior Facade thou looks quite nice. Could become Icon of Clementi.
 
Location wise i see the Traffic, MRT track & school behind i  
Within 10mins walking distance to MRT. But no shelter so rain or hot sun again  
 
Dropped Trilinq because it was asking appx 1.3k+ psf for compact 3bedder.
To be honest Lakeville is a better Bargain but still abit too ex.
End up got a resale instead further West.
 
I think Trilinq had released some units btw $1.1k+ psf onwards.
Lakevile also have units selling from $1.1k+ psf.
Seems both dropped prices 5% - 10% from 2015.
At $1.1k psf i think can consider liao.
 
With Govt's Heavy Investment at JE (JLD/HSR/2nd CBD) & JW (JID).
These 2 projects and others in West might be a decent buy.
2025 both Infrastructure should be up & running.
Should have some $ to make barring recession.
Just my 2cents.
 
Cheers!

That's true with regards to absd and QC.... but no need pay interest meh?
 
And even if they funded this with all cash, they don't need to consider opportunity cost?

Just a note.
 
Property athough not like perishable goods do ungo physical deterioration. 
Especialy the exterior and facade. 
Units which have TOPed and not sold becomes more and more difficult to sell.
In the end they become permanently unsold. There are several examples
 
Nobody likes to buy an empty old "new" unit
Unless the price is discounted.
 
The business of developers is to sell and roll
Not keep and bet on where the market will go.
 
Good luck.
 
I retire from this thread as my current opinions and thoughts have already been deeply expressed

To sell at a much reduced price (to move units), probably is a higher cost to them than the opportunity cost of holding on to the units and selling later at the desired price.  That is a risk that the developer takes.  Time will tell.

Certainly the JE and JW story will come good one day but real potential will not be fully realised  in the next 5 years at least and probably much longer
 
Don't forget an entity called Forward pricing, which many developers do in boom time.
 
Jurong Gateway sold at 1700pfs. Consider transaction and holding cost, will need near 2000pfs just to even out
 
The question is how many 10 years of life does one have to wait.

Tonight's spotlight is on Alex Residences. 
 
A leasehold development near the Redhill MRT.  Total 429 units, with 173 unsold units remaining.  According to the development's brochure, the expected TOP is Feb 2019.  This is 6 years+ from the date of land sales award in Dec 2012, exceeding the 5-year ABSD deadline!  In all likelihood, the TOP can be expected to be much earlier, in late 2017, to avoid the ABSD deadline.
 
The transacted psf ranges from $1,437psf to $2,108psf.  Most of the lower floors (i.e 22nd floors and below) have been sold.   Looking at the price trend of past transactions from 2013 to 2015, it is evident that the average psf (see attached picture) has been creeping up since mid-2014, as units are sold progressively from the lower (cheaper) to the upper (more expensive) floors.

"Singapore Land (SingLand) general manager Michael Ng told The Business Times that the group does not intend to have any units left by the deadlines to meet ABSD remission conditions. "We don't have the intention to lower prices also," he said."
 
The best selling point of this development is that it is a short walk to the Redhill MRT.  Having a MBS-like infinity pool at the highest floor, 40th floor, which overlooks the eastern side of Singapore, is another selling point.
 
The ABSD penalty for this development is $33.3M, if it is not 100% sold by the 5-year deadline.   A possible fire sale near end-2017? Only time will tell if Mr Ng's confidence is misplaced.

Tough competition for Alex residence.
 
Launched later than most of the condos around the redhill mrt and also the name sounds common.
 
Echelon (name sounds more atas) just next to it, had a big advantage bec launched the weekend before the last CM 
 
Needed balloting
 
Prices quite ridiculous, think the lowest floor for the studio units went for 1800+pfs and all the way up past 2000pfs for higher floors 
 
Echelon will be top soon
 
Overall good location but not worth the price range. Competition for rentals for the smaller units will be very very tough in due time
 
Alexis (the mother of Mickey Mouse units in the area), a bit distance away has already seen quite a bit of rental drop in the past year.
 
If own stay, maybe still OK

The best selling point of this development is that it is a short walk to the Redhill MRT.  Having a MBS-like infinity pool at the highest floor, 40th floor, which overlooks the eastern side of Singapore, is another selling point.
 
The ABSD penalty for this development is $33.3M, if it is not 100% sold by the 5-year deadline.   A possible fire sale near end-2017? Only time will tell if Mr Ng's confidence is misplaced.

Tough competition for Alex residence.
 
Launched later than most of the condos around the redhill mrt and also the name sounds common.
 
Echelon (name sounds more atas) just next to it, had a big advantage bec launched the weekend before the last CM 
 
Needed balloting
 
Prices quite ridiculous, think the lowest floor for the studio units went for 1800+pfs and all the way up past 2000pfs for higher floors 
 
Echelon will be top soon
 
Overall good location but not worth the price range. Competition for rentals for the smaller units will be very very tough in due time
 
Alexis (the mother of Mickey Mouse units in the area), a bit distance away has already seen quite a bit of rental drop in the past year.
 
If own stay, maybe still OK
Spot on..The Ascentia also many units letting go..
I think Metropolitan will be a better buy due to the location n rental potential..
Those who initially bought Metropolitan had a really good rental yield ...

Up and coming launch of a new condo in Jurong East area.
 
 
The 1st property sold under the 2015 URA Land Sales will soon be launched.  Lake Grande, by MCL Land, with a total of 550 units.
 
Being near to Jurong Lake, the selling point of this development is its promixity to the Lakeside MRT, and a short drive to Jurong East area. 
 
It will compete directly with next door Lakeville (also by MCL Land) that is currently under construction, which is 84% sold, with 113 unsold units (of a total of 696 units).  
 
It is interesting to note that Lake Grande was procured in Mar 2015 at $630 psf per plot ratio (ppr), while 2 years earlier, Lakeville was procured in Jan 2015 at $651 psf ppr.  The difference of a mere 3% in the psf ppr indicates that the same property developer was eager to procure the adjacent land (of Lakeville) to block any rival developers from winning the land sales and potentially undercutting Lakeville in selling price.  Well, MCL Land had succeeded in this aspect! 
 
It will be interesting to see how MCL will pitch its new development against its older silbling. Kind of reminding you of Sky Habitat and Sky Vue (both by CapitaLand), right? Both were designed very differently, with a price range very different from each other. 
 
Will we see the same situation for both Lakeville and Lake Grande?  We will have to wait for the group's chief executive officer, Koh Teck Chuan, to reveal this.
 
 
To sum up, I will quote the often used phrase "Time will tell".  We eagerly await the new launch of Lake Grande!

next up is Gem at toa payoh
 
all agents are geared up for this 
 
as usual units are small. now just waiting to see the price. most likely not much surprise there  

 
The last private property in Toa Payoh was the Trellis Tower, launched in the late 1990s.   I think there will be a pent-up demand for another private property in Toa Payoh. 
 
The land was bid (under HDB Land sales) in Jun 2015 for $755 psf ppr and therefore, I will not be surprised if the launch price range is from $1,400 to $1,600 psf for the units, judging from recent transactions for Trellis Tower.  If the developer is optimistic, it might be priced higher from $1,500 psf to $1,700 psf. 
 
Now the not so good selling points of this property:
 
1) Some people might avoid this property if they are superstitious of staying near a temple, Seu Teck Sean Tong.
 
2) In terms of MRT accessibility, it is not within walking distance of the Braddell MRT.   Two bus stops away.
 
3) By car, to exit to Braddell road, you have to drive one big round around the estate (via Lor 4, 5, 7 and 6)  to reach to the intersection where you turn right from Lor 6 to go to the flyover along Braddell road.  If you return to the property via Braddell road, there is a notorious traffic bottleneck near the CTE exit to Braddell road. 
 
4) The property is surrounded by HDB flats.  HDB Block 53, which is 20 storeys high and built on higher ground, will partially block the view from the units facing South.
 
There you have it.  A preliminary review, until I got more information of Gem.

very good analysis bro
 
yes, launch pricing likely to be average $1,500 psf. To be adjusted accordingly based on initial take up
 
it could sell well due to the pent up demand as you have mentioned. BD ppl in the developer told me they are optimistic about the sales.
 
As for quality, i have some reservations. They haven't done that many projects. It is very much an opportunistic PE kinda setup.
 
They have sold well in previous projects due to market conditions.
 
well, see how well it goes in May.. to be continued.. 
 
btw i saw that their 5 bedrooms is 1,299 sqft?? wow!!

Hmmm.... That area,  machiam like kana haze throughout the year. Qing Ming, seven month etc lots of burning from the temple. Also the temple also stores the urn of the dead. Not that attractive leg. Unless your ancestor is put there and u like to pay daily respect!

This one not exactly a JEM
 
Mature estate, Toa Payoh, near town etc
 
But it is not in the best location in Toa Payoh, Hub area still the best
 
But definitely walkable,10 mins walk to Braddell MRT or faster if can run
 
Think pricing still the main determining factor whether it will sell or not
 
Many staying there will buy if pricing is right bec good to be close to parents or grandparents 
 
$1500 pfs for studios still OK but if for normal size units, its expensive
 
For some, the temple which looks elevated may be a problem but that really depends on facing and orientation of the blocks and units
 
best guess is they should be able to sell at least 20-30% of units easily and if pricing is right, probably more

I absolutely refuse to believe there is any oversupply
 
until I see prices fall substantially.
 
The only reason prices are not going up faster
 
is due to cooling measures.
 
If the CMs are removed I can see prices
 
sky rocketing.
 
Btw I am not a property salesman.
 
 

 
  Sounds like a property pundit, however I do liked your way of thinking

Today, the spotlight is on a very unknown property, by YTL group.
 
For those who drove their cars to attend a wedding at The Regent Singapore would have noticed a fenced up area on the left side of Cuscaden Road before turning right into the hotel's premises to go to the car park.
 
A big noticeboard on the fence will indicate that the developer is YTL.  This is the 3 Orchard by the Park.  The land was procured for $435M or at a high of $2,498 psf ppr.  This means that the selling price of the planned 77 units will have to be in the range of about $3,200 psf ppr just to to break-even. 
 
The current poor market sentiment means that this freehold development will not see the 'daylight' anytime soon.

Paterson Collection is a freehold development, consisting of 85 units.  The expected buyers are the very rich people, as this development is in a very prime area, and consists only large-sized units of 3-bedder, 4-bedder and penthouses.
 
The developer is Bukit Sembawang View.  It obtained TOP in  2015.  The parent company, Bukit Sembawang Estates, made a provision loss of $17.5M in its 2014 annual report.
 
This is a property that you cannot walk in and buy, simply because it is not launched yet, in view of poor market sentiments.

Being converted to service apartment i think, but so far no announcement from the company yet, strange.

   Sembawang changed plan to build Residential landed property last 3 years ago, due to the higher plot ratio, they decided to build condo instead, a miscalculation i must admit, haven't they noticed many condo status around the area, across the road was SC Global ' The Marque " was marketing it for $3200+psf yet still many vacant units.
 
  I don't think one cannot walk in and buy, they decided to hold water and wait for new announcement by REDAS chief or Gahmen to waive extension charges etc, every now and then when i drove passed, can't see still under contraction, debris non stop, yet act so atas! 
 
Class Act really ! ( I peter to leave empty coz I got money to pay MSW durian prices yet got to eat only mango

Location of this soon to be launched Jem residence not too bad
 
Went to walk around, actually walk to Braddell MRT only about 5 mins, not as far away as on the map
 
Opp is the camp which is low rise.
 
So if they orientate most of the blocks away from the temple, wont have much impact. 
 
By car, the toa payoh area is not that big, so moving around from Lor 1 to Lor 3 to Hub is also quite easy and many connecting buses
 
If they price this right, should be able to sell

SINGAPORE'S Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong on Monday maintained that the property cooling measures have been effective in stabilising the property market and it remains "too early to declare victory and unwind the measures".
 
Good for Lawrence Wong.  Please keep it that way.  All the bros here are looking forward to 2017, the D-day for many developers!

Stars of Kovan, a new condominium development at the junction of Tampines Road and Upper Serangoon Road, is going to be launched when its showflat opens on 30 Apr 2016. 
 
What can be expected?
 
395 residential units, 46 retail shops. 
 
1 bedroom - 90 units (506sf) from $710K
 
2 bedroom - 240 units (743/764sf) from $1.05M
 
3 bedroom - 60 units (958sf) from $1.37M
 
Strata house - 5 units (1830sf).  Pricing unknown.
 
The land sales was done in 27 Nov 2014, at a bid price of $849psf ppr, higher than the bid price of $775psf ppr for Poiz Residences, which means that it is priced higher than Poiz Residences (although the latter is nearer to downtown), perhaps at an average price of $1,500psf upwards (Poiz Residences achieved an average price of $1,433psf)  (Info from Edge Property Website).
 
 
This development is very near to Kovan MRT (a short walk) and is a short drive away from KPE. 
 
This development will set a new benchmark for condo prices around the Kovan MRT, as the nearby completed developments like Kovan Melody and Kovan Residences were recently transacted at an average of $1,000psf to $1,100psf.    
 
The developer is promising surprises for registered buyers at the launch.   We can only await and see what strategy the developer is adopting to generate sales in this price-sensitive property market that we are in now.

For that crap location, and at current market, only a gian png will pay anything more than $1150psf for it.
That is regardless of the price the developer paid.
 
Lets see the picture of those gian pngs at the showflat launch....
I am expecting some agent to post that real soon

Kovan regency was hotly taken up.
 
Of course times are different now
 
This one at the junction of tampines road and U serangoon and only 200m from kovan MRT will generate interest for sure
 
The mixed development, 46 retails shops will help
 
But pricing is still key.
 
Anything above 1400pfs will be expensive
 
Will appeal to Families staying around the area and wish to stay near parents 
 
If they market at 1200-1400pfs after discount, the take up might be good
 
As for investment, there are many better choices around
 
They are just too many new or soon to be completed condos around the area. 
 
 
 

Stars of Kovan, a new condominium development at the junction of Tampines Road and Upper Serangoon Road, is going to be launched when its showflat opens on 30 Apr 2016. 
 
What can be expected?
 
395 residential units, 46 retail shops. 
 
1 bedroom - 90 units (506sf) from $710K
 
2 bedroom - 240 units (743/764sf) from $1.05M
 
3 bedroom - 60 units (958sf) from $1.37M
 
Strata house - 5 units (1830sf).  Pricing unknown.
 
The land sales was done in 27 Nov 2014, at a bid price of $849psf ppr, higher than the bid price of $775psf ppr for Poiz Residences, which means that it is priced higher than Poiz Residences (although the latter is nearer to downtown), perhaps at an average price of $1,500psf upwards (Poiz Residences achieved an average price of $1,433psf)  (Info from Edge Property Website).
 
 
This development is very near to Kovan MRT (a short walk) and is a short drive away from KPE. 
 
This development will set a new benchmark for condo prices around the Kovan MRT, as the nearby completed developments like Kovan Melody and Kovan Residences were recently transacted at an average of $1,000psf to $1,100psf.    
 
The developer is promising surprises for registered buyers at the launch.   We can only await and see what strategy the developer is adopting to generate sales in this price-sensitive property market that we are in now.

Thanks to all bros who feedback how they feel about the Stars of Kovan.  I think the developer might see 'stars' on the launch date. 
 
 
As a comparison (albeit 99-year lease vs freehold), next door to Stars of Kovan is The Tembusu, an uncompleted freehold condo which saw 323 units sold, out of a total of 337 (96% sold).  Average price achieved for The Tembusu is $1,466psf (Info from Edge property website).

Owners of SC Global's Lincoln Modern are asking slightly above $1,500 a foot now. That is freehold and relatively nicely designed but old. And the location is definitely better than Kovan

We might surmise or conclude they overpaid but they might have very strong reasons for their choices.
 
Some people have need to stay in a particular area and there might be limited new housing in that vicinity. Surely no need to use such strong words?

I agree. There are many more affordable options around that vicinity as well. 
 
Cheung Kong projects are usually at a premium as well. A certain degree of uncertainty with costs going forward. But not sure if they are able to pull off benchmarking selling price at FH tenures prices.

Lincoln Modern arty farty one, only certain people will like the loft concept, like buying airspace
 
There is no land. Not so suitable for families with kids
 
But Newton/Novena area excellent for families with all the centers for kids and popular schs and eateries and next door to orchard.
 
Would think one of the top locations

The down trend of the property market is still intact, slow but steady.   10 consecutive quarters since the peak in 3 Qtr, 2013.   In the meantime, D-day for some developers are drawing closer (5-year ABSD penalty), as highlighted in my first posting of this thread.
 
To bros who are aspiring to own a private property at reasonable prices, play it cool by being patient.

I sense an euphoria building up for the month of May and June, when everyone can expect a flood of news on property updates on the outcome of the 1st launch of new condos (Stars of Kovan ,Gem, etc) and 2nd launch (2nd phase) of previously unreleased units of new condos (e.g. Highline Residences). 
 
We are reaching the end of the 3rd year of the most 'punitive' cooling measure (TDSR) implemented in Jun 2013. Recent economic news indicated that Singapore has averted a bad start in the 1st quarter 2016, when the stock market plunged in early 2016 and everyone was feeling gloomy (myself included) but managed to recover some ground towards the end of the 1st quarter.
 
The question is, those who have waited on the sidelines for the property market to correct - have they run out of patience and decide that the 10 consecutive quarters of property price decline are sufficient for them to now take the plunge to commit to a very expensive endeavour (buying private property)?
 
The COE prices, which move in tandem with the economic pulse of Singapore and its stock market, recently recovered, helped no doubt by the inclusion of Uber and Grab companies into the fray of bidding for a limited supply of COE.  It seems to indicate that the general sentiment on the ground is no longer as pessimistic as before, and people are willing to commit to the 2nd most expensive endeavour (buying cars) in Singapore?  
 
Now that the MAS has released advanced figures that showed that the economic growth in the 1st quarter has beaten the analysts' expectations, perhaps things are not so bad after all. 
 
http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/singapore-economy-expands/2691186.html?cx_tag=similar&cid=tg:recos:similar:standard#cxrecs_s
 
So what is my take in all this developments? 
 
To tell the truth, the crystal ball is still very hazy (like the Indonesia forest fires last year).  Uncertainly still lingers.  Will the brave (those who make the decision to buy properties now) be rewarded in the near future?
 
 
To paraphrase: are we seeing the light at the end of the tunnel for the property market?  Or is it a case of reaching the end of the tunnel, only to find the headlights of an on-coming train?
 
Still the same old words.  Time will tell........

Very clear to me.
 
Developers can basically only cut up the units to small ones to encourgae easy buying.
The low end property buyers who can only spare a couple hundred grand will continue to buy.
Although not enough to buy up the supply no matter. 
 
The discerning ones who can afford $2-3mil will still hold back. 
Whats the value of a high priced 99yr new development when one can buy a well maintain freehold one in a more centralised solid location.  The truly seasoned property buyers know.
 
For now
If buy to stay, sure. Just buy and move on.
If buy for investment, stupid ah?
 
So i state my opinion again as evidence in case some goons try to put words in my mouth
1. I never said SG property will crash and burn.
2. I said that my targetted property segment will drop steadily every year and continue to drop over the next 4-5yrs starting 2014 
 
This means i willnot be looking at buying an investment property until probably 2018 at least
If i buy then, my targets will be in excess of 850sft in size. Probably around 1200sft which is decent for 2 or 3 adults.  Maybe 1500sft for 4 adults.   
 
my liquid investments return about 6%pa yield right now without the use of any leverage.  
 
In terms of bargains, there are some decent buys for folks who are not buying for investments
I still get bombarded by agents who ask me to preview this and attend that for special price and developer direct discounts.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ps.  
The above is all toa pow.  I own a HDB in CCK and i am currently jobless due to retrenchment last year.

Just too many variables
 
To buy in 2018 only based on today's factors, may well evolve with govt intervention and external factors
 
The pent up demand is real and for the benefit of everyone, it is best this does not get too bottled up
 
If not drop of 10-15% from now till 2018 maybe well negated by a sudden 20-30% rebound

I didnt say to buy in 2018, i say will not be looking until 2018 base on situation as it is.
To buy or not to buy in 2018 is still a question.
 
Of course if things change then one has to react and take necessary action.
 
In life , you have to take a stand and put money where your mouth is.
If i read the situation wrongly, i pay the price loh.
my track record is 100% choon choon so i trust myself.
As of today, still choon choon.
 
And doesnt matter even if wrong, money still in my pocket,.
Fully paid roof over my head.

Here to support bro tenyawph   post some "new bargains" news 
 
Bro, seems like buying momentum picking up, after the news about non easing of CM near term.
Can see many already starting to pull trigger and load up, pent up demand?
 
Developers new launch units are shifting fast, somemore upping prices.
Sturdee one day preview 40% sold, now increasing prices at official launch.

Sturdee Residences to officially launch at slightly higher prices
April 29, 2016 
 
Those previous launch unsold units, buyers are also going in with the rebates/discounts.
Ardmore Three units 4mil to 6mil each, should be investors loading up?
For OUE twin peaks, buyers are opting for deferred payment scheme ($2700psf), rather than getting straight off discounts ($2300psf)
something to ponder 
 
http://www.theedgeproperty.com.sg/content/discounts-rebates-ardmore-three-draw-buyers
Discounts, rebates at Ardmore Three draw buyers
April 29, 2016 
 
On April 13, the developer started offering buyers a 15% discount and a 15% ABSD rebate under the “ABSD assistance package” to offset the additional buyer’s stamp duty. This means the effective purchase price of units will be from $4.54 million or $2,540 psf. According to marketing agents, the offer only applies to units from the 9th to the 20th floors, and will be for a limited period only.
 
Word on the street is that there has been a flurry of sales since this special offer was made a fortnight ago, and it will be evident in the caveats lodged in subsequent weeks.
 
Last month, developer OUE offered two alternative schemes to buyers of its 462-unit OUE Twin Peaks on Leonie Hill Road: a straight 15% discount for selected units with prices starting from $2,300 psf, or the option of purchasing with a deferred payment scheme, with units starting from $2,700 psf. 
 
Although the caveats have not been lodged yet, the developer is said to have sold quite a number of units under the deferred payment scheme, according to a property agent. The merit of this scheme is that a buyer only needs to pay a 20% down payment, and the remaining 80%, two to three years later.

Thank you, Mercs.
 
 
Sturdee Residences
Although Sturdee Residences achieved sales of 40% sold in a single day, which is a good start in today's context. However, if I am the developer, I won't want to pop the champagne bottle just yet, until I see at least 90% sold.  The fact is most of the units sold are the smaller-sized ones (more affordable), which makes selling the larger-sized ones (less affordable) much harder later. 
 
A case study in early success
 Alex Residences was 35% sold (150 units) in a single day during a limited launch (200 units) in late 2013.  Fast forward to 2016.  Alex Residences is now about 60% sold (257 units). 
 
Having said that, SingLand, the developer has only launched 280 units (in total 429 units) for sale, so we can say that it is 92% sold based on launched units.  Is SingLand holding back the remaining units for a better sales opportunity, hoping for an economy turn-around (if it does) in 2017? 
 
SingLand is playing a tight game here, with its looming 5-year ABSD penalty at the end of 2017 (land was procured 11 Dec 2012).
 
OUE Twin Peaks
Looking through the caveats lodged in Mar and Apr 2016 (URA website), the units sold are the six 500+ sq foot units, and one 1,000+ sq foot unit.  Looks like a few have ventured in.    
 
Let's see how the next few months will fare for the property market.  After a quiet few months in sales transactions, it seems like there is a hype coming!

All these "Only Release X no of units and sold Y%" are all marketing talk
You give a cheque, any unit can be available, its only about price.
 
Alex residences launch was just a little wee too late, with the last ABSD and TDSR kicking in
Echelon immediately next to it launched a few months earlier is near 100% soldout.
 
Alex has to also compete with the other launches and newly completed ones in the area
and further more "Alex" does not sound too Atas to some people
 
Maybe if the name is like   "Heavenly Residences"  , it could attract more attention   
 

Thank you, Mercs.

Unless going for those SGD 5 million onwards, minimum 2mil then have chance for bargains.
 
Lower priced ones your eyes will pop at the reserve price.

OUE Twin Peaks
Looking through the caveats lodged in Mar and Apr 2016 (URA website), the units sold are the six 500+ sq foot units, and one 1,000+ sq foot unit.  Looks like a few have ventured in.    
 
 
Bro, some new bargains updates  
OUE Twin peaks- not few, already close to 100 units sold, could be even more by now? 
"OUE's move to introduce a deferred payment scheme for Twin Peaks seems to have worked, with close to 100 units sold since late March" 
 
New pattern from developer to move units 
"More developers are set to take reference from this. TG Development, the developer of Lloyd SixtyFive, is introducing an "experimental purchaser scheme" under which the buyer pays 12.5 per cent of the purchase price for an option that will let him occupy the unit without paying maintenance fees and property tax for a few years. This will hopefully let him defer the purchase until such time as the Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty is lifted or reduced."
 
New launches Stars of Kovan and Gems also attracting healthy turnout  let's see if that translate to sales 
"Turnout at two of the latest launches seems promising. Cheung Kong Property got about 4,000 visitors at its Stars of Kovan VIP preview at the weekend, while Gem Residences in Toa Payoh has drawn 1,036 expressions of interest since its April 29 preview."

Property market emerging from the doldrums?
May 11, 2016
 
Slowly but surely, the property market is emerging from its slumber, with more activity expected in coming months, going by recent data.
 
Both private apartment and Housing Board flat resale volumes last month were the highest in about three years, according to flash estimates from SRX Property.
 
Some of the resale transactions included developer sales of completed stock, where price cuts and creative methods of structuring payments have proved successful in selling units.
 
A key factor is that buyers and sellers have been waiting to see what would happen to cooling measures and prices and, having waited long enough, are starting to move.
 
Post-Budget, there appeared to be confirmation that there would be no changes to cooling measures, encouraging investors who have been on the sidelines to act.
 
Indeed, despite plenty of bargain hunting in the resale market - buyers today view as many as 10 or 15 properties before committing - there is no shortage of interest, said Mr Eugene Lim, ERA Realty key executive officer. "In the last two years, people were not even prepared to buy," he said.

I would not choose to remind Pak Tahir about these purchases although they dont mean much to him.
One of the very few bad business decisions he made from the perspective of timing and he knows it himself.
 
Of course, he wont sell as there is no need to do so for him.  Just give 3 to each of the four children just nice.
 
But thats Pak Tahir.
 
how many of us peasants can take the hit of buying an investment property at the peak especially with leverage and the possibility of job loss?  
 
 
And tomorrow, I am going to suan my Tate Residences friend. 
He is on the 16th floor and he paid more than that years ago.
Until now still cannot see green.  But good thing he lives in it.
Muayhahaha.
But i better not suan him too much, wait he suan me jobless bum.

That one different calculation liao.
 
A person with $1000 only cannot own flat,
 
But a person who has saved 20% down payment (of a flat) and earns $1000 per month can indeed own the cheapest flat. The key word in Hui Ge's article is "salary".
 
No salary (figure) no talk nowadays.
 
you want to talk to hui ge?

For GEM, the number of EOI is around 1,600
 
Price is slightly lower than what was previously thought (to generate perception that u are getting a discount   )
 
So far what i heard:
 
1 bedroom starting under 600K 
 
2 bedroom starting under 800K
 
3 bedroom starting 1.1M to highest 1.6M
 
4 bedroom starting 1.6M
 
overall PSF looks like 1300+ to 1400+ thereabouts

Yup used to be much more.
After so many years still losing money, but good thing he living there.
Moreover he put $500k into renovation and designer furniture
I see red shirts and blue shirts...how many calefe huh?
Chey.
This kind of development, buyer buys one unit but goes with whole family in tow.
So minimum divide by 4.
 
Then the story would be more accurate.

After working so hard for the past few weeks, developer only managed to secure 2,000 EOIs... The good O' days easily could have been 10,000
 
Anyway it will be ballot system and i hope this Friday nobody cry for not getting their unit... sometimes this kinda launch very heartbreaking... worse than korean drama, when people get depressed like there is no other condo unit to buy in Singapore.. or those who tio the unit jumped for joy like he had won $8M TOTO  
 
very stressed man, after the friday craziness i will be heading down perth on Sat to chill and slow down a little

Its expected.
First, its named GEMS, everyone likes "GEMS"
Second, its Toa Payoh, super convenient to city and super town
Third, launch price was slightly below expectations
Fourth, clever marketing, they compared prices with older developments and claimed well priced.
Fifth, its on slightly elevated ground, good fengshui
Last even in MCF, its discussed under New "Bargains"

Looking at GEMS (Toa Payoh) website, the developer is not paying agent's commission.  It is using their own sales team.
 

 
Is the developer passing down the savings to the buyers?

LOL/.. what developer sales team? This is agent lingo for ERA being officially appointed by developer
 
No commission paid by buyer lah... haha another stating the obvious trick to make buyer feel like he is getting a great deal of savings
 
I can't imagine a small developer, PE type of setup firm like Evia to hire a few thousand staff on its payroll to market this GEM

haha, more than 5 million people in Singapore. Easily at any point in time now, more than 1 million (top 20% of income earners) have the financial ability to buy at today's prices, just whether they want to or not
 
assuming just 1% of them has the balls to do it now and the other 99% invest enough already or don't dare, that's 10,000 units waiting to be absorbed 
 
my own estimate only hor, don't take my word for it, i am not a property analyst

It's in reference to buying resale condo. 
 
For those sales, usually either or both seller and buyer have to pay agent commission on top of agreed prices. Very very rarely do buyer and seller meet directly and transact, except maybe mortgagee sales.
 
For new sales such as this, the developer pays the agent direct and its factored into the selling price. So based on the selling price and the loan secured, there is no additional comms.

125,000 people stay at Toa Payoh and many have been there for many years with extended families
GEMS cater largely to those who wish to stay there or close to parents rather to savvy investors
So to outsiders TP maybe crowded and HDBish, but these are the least of the concerns for this group of buyers 
If they want big, with rivers and forest and parks, they can easily go north to punggol or other outskirts or even to JB
 
Most who are familiar with marketing certainly think that they have packaged their product very  well in the mass media
Actually marketing that appears clever to inexperienced folks is good enough 
Because vast majority of buyers are not Warren Buffett

For those who on leave this week because of Euro 2016, lazing around and doing nothing in the afternoon:
 
Look for a possible bargain, on 21 Jun, Tuesday, 2.30pm, where there is a property auction at Amara Hotel, Connection Room 1, Level 3.  Conducted by Frank Knight.   Or another property auction on 23 Jun, Thursday, 2.30pm, same venue.  Conducted by JLL.
 
For those who have never been to a property auction before, you can catch the 'live' action for the first time.  Come prepared with a cheque though, if you are serious. 
 
Some transactions are done on the side line after the auction itself, if there are no takers during the auction itself.

Interesting forum. Any updates recently on bargains for condos since we are nearing towards the end of 2016?

Singaporeans never learn their lesson,  sellout doesn't make a condo a good investment.  JGateway was soldout in hours and now approaching TOP, nobody is interested to buy. The subsale done at $1.7 million was a disastrous and desperate sale chalking up more than $200k in losses for the owner in sellers stamp duty.

When agents say long term investment, you need to be careful. Their long term is usually an indefinite timeline and it also means you are either paying too high for the unit with no prospect of offloading in the next few years.

The one that paid SSD plus BSD of 200,000 sold higher than buying price by 128,000.
 
The other one lost less.
 
Is a disaster of sorts because not able to hold at least 2 more years.
