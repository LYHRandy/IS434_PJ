I mean the really really 366sqft studios with no balcony, if they work in the city and need to iron shirts and suites how do they dry them? In SG it seems to take days for clothes indoors to dry. 
 
And one can't iron and then put back to dryer to winkle it again.

I live in HDB.  My laundry was never hang outside.
 
Except for rainy days, it takes less than a day to dry.
 
The only place i know that takes days to dry is winter in HK.

When they are like semi dry iron them without using steam function lah ; easier to iron ; I do that during dec-Jan months sometimes ; but to keep clothes like 2-3 days and still moist /damp will make them smelly somehow faster when wearing even after a few hours

Got to work around either having a dryer unit or hang  clothes in living hall or bedroom windows ... people got to improvise; just like how we do drying clothes in hotels though it is minimal

I really wonder how people in hk esp those who stay in those super small room, how they managed to dry their clothing? Hdb here think most should not have problem drying their clothing, since the flat here generally not that small.

It is not a issue. I walk in and out so many different type of studio apartments  that there is always a solution to this drying problem.
 
Some people use dryer. The westerners use that a lot even if they have a proper place to dry their clothes. For others, if they have no balcony, no yard  area, then dryer is the way to go.
 
Then those that have balconies will use a clothes rack and hang at the balconies. Most studio apartments have balconies.

366sqft is only 36 sqm, it is a size of hotel room. The tinny space has to be shared among kitchen, living , toilet and bedroom, i wonder there is space left for other items like a dryer.
Back to your question , if cannot iron and put back to dryer to wrinkle up the clothing again, that mean there is already a dryer at home, it is a process or sequence problem , nothing to do with the size of the house. A person who live in a 360sqm house will have the same problem is he has his sequence mixed up.
Solution wise for such a small unit, stacking a dryer above washing machine seems to be a viable option.

I like to borrow this thread to touch on studio apartment. Developers build these small studio apartments and sell them at 600k to 700k, making the apartment like quite affordable, in fact the $/psf of these apartments are very expensive. The developers in fact have made huge profit out of these apartments, but what the buyers get is a small miserable unit after paying a huge chunk of their life long hard earned money. 
My own take about these shoe  box is, they are mostly 99 years, they are too small to live comfortably, they are one of the most expensive  apartment  by $/psf. If anyone wants to spend 600k for a house, buying a hdb and spend money to soup it up would make a lot more sense, more living space, more toilet, more living room with bigger kitchen. After all a small shoe box is also 99 years like hdb, i urge  those who are considering this to think hard again. We should boycott sales of shoe box apartment and developers.

Agreed! Studios are the highest tier of housing in Singapore. 
I reason that the same rationale applies to condo vs HDB, and vs JB landed. Thus we ought to boycott condos too! 
The only good housing to buy is HDB.

Hang them next to a fan or open window if possible  
Iron them when semi wet.  When I mean iron you can either iron as per normal or just put your iron on the shirt then lift up and put to another area.  In no time your clothes will be steaming.   Might not be dry but it dries faster.  
 
Even if it's rainy you can still dry it if you use the ironing method.  How straight will it be as opposed to wrinkled I cannot say.
 
My experience is when I lived in a backpacker hostel in winter and there is no dryer available. In fact, no washing machine also so it's hand wash.

Bro...when buyers buy property, it is not always about $psf. It is also about lifestyle, exclusiveness, location, views, etc.
 
It is like buying a car. If all they need is to go point A to B,  the expensive German cars will not be some of the best selling brands in Singapore.

Yes, they do but need to run 40-60 minutes. A lot of tenanted units have 2-in-1 dryer. I have one at home too, but I prefer to dry my clothes at the balcony.

I used to stay in a studio apartment overseas in the 90's. I did most of my laundry at nearby laundrettes and will bring a book to go to the nearby cafe or eatery for a drink or a meal. Will return to take the washed clothes out and place it into the dryer and go for more reading, work or go for a walk. For items that cannot be put into dryer, will bring it home to hang dry in the house.

They should collect the water and filter it.

These two charts show drying clothes free air should't be be a problem. At times after a trip when the the clothes are too many to hang up, we use a dryer.  On days when it rains, the clothes are not completely dry, just a few minutes in the dryer completes the drying.

Did reply by donut mentioned the brand of the spray? I just see that it says red bottle spray le?!

he cannot remember the brand and neither can i.
 
your clue is red bottle, white spray head, ang mo sounding brand, not made in SEA. $6ish i think. sold in the bigger NTUCs. I bought mine at Finest.
 
edit: a little googling. http://newcleanliving.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/stain-cleaners.jpg it's the left most bottle. Called zout.

nope! My missus prefer it that way! She was the want who started to hang indoors much to my chagrin because i am the one paying the electricity bills. She will even wash the clothes at night sometimes at midnight and put them under the fan to dry. It will be dry by 8 am.
 
 
you got a good wife who tries to be prudent and you are ungrateful
 
look at Rosmah what mess had she done to her husband

Seems like it can be compressed and kept in a shelf.

I mean the really really 366sqft studios with no balcony, if they work in the city and need to iron shirts and suites how do they dry them? In SG it seems to take days for clothes indoors to dry. 
 
And one can't iron and then put back to dryer to winkle it again.
It’s not just the shoebox studio units lah. 
Many of the new (smallish) 1,000-1,300 sqft condo units - where the developers squeeze in 3-4 bedrooms, also do not have much (if any) drying yard area behind that opens to the great outdoors.

for the apt i am renting out, there is a washer and then a dryer on top, both belly loading. i thought that should be a pretty common configuration. 
 
usually, such tenants will have a weekend maid coming in to clean and do laundry and ironing, and all the laundry must be clean, dry and back in the wardrobe for next week.  the tenants don't really care how it's done, but won't want to see clothes hanging all over the place. 
 
usually the dryer will get the clothes to 70-80% dry, and then the iron gets to 100%.  the clothes are a little damn, so don't need to spray some more water, and much easier to iron.  everything if washed, will generally be ironed, even bedsheets. those that cannot be ironed, the tenant will be hanging here there everywhere, but that's up to them. 
 
that is my experience in any case.

Why not get a dryer which can dry 100% at one go.
Dry to 70% and then finish off by ironing seems so inconvenient. Those that cannot be ironed still need to be hung up.
Won’t talk about more time needed, as the tenant has maid.

because dryer always doesn't seem to get you to 100%, and the output is always one entangled crumpled mess so you will always need some ironing.  things that cannot be iron, i think generally shouldn't be in a dryer as well.

My gf family used dryer for many years. Don’t seem to have any issue. Once finish drying can iron, fold and keep in waredrobe already. No smell at all.
 
If you are afraid the dryer will be messy or damage your cloth. Just buy laundry bag and it will solve the problem. 
 
We are talking about private condos right? So naturally the mentally should be different from HDB. Most people in HDB has the fixed mindset of hanging cloths out to dry.
 
Anyway HDB is also getting smaller this days, and gov are now implementing open kitchen as well. So what’s the diff? It’s just a trend that has already sit in and we just have to adapt to these changes. 
 
Size of house will continue to get smaller over times. Unless you don’t mind staying in older development which might bring you the risk of building defects, en-bloc,  obsolete, difficult to sell, lack of facilities, pest issue, and the possibilities of other issues..
 
I’m going to stay in a 2 + study soon. So will keep my house lean and use dryer to dry my cloths.
 
Just be flexible and there will be solution to every problem.

Finally starting to see the young generation coming of age and starting to post. 
 
For us of the older generations, it will be an eye opener about how the young people solve problems creatively, effectively and decisively.

If you live in a tiny studio, the last thing you worry about is drying your clothes, since you can already compromise your living quality.
 
Given Shoebox and studio units  or flat? I rather live in a flat. More space for yourself and visitors.

I mean the really really 366sqft studios with no balcony, if they work in the city and need to iron shirts and suites how do they dry them? In SG it seems to take days for clothes indoors to dry.
