that's the most important question. When i got married in 07 and was looking for house, i thought it was crazy then. it's getting worse now and i can't imagine how ppl are going to pay for that kind of pricing given that kind of pay for the average singaporeans. best is to live with parents, apply for new HDB and rent out.

The 70s to 80s idea of affordable housing had gone down the drain. Now everything is $$$ and more $$$.

Cheap FT = Cheapened local pay = need cheap housing  
 

Cheap housing should not exceed 100K for 4 room and 150K for 5 room. Rough rule of thumb: selling price should not exceed 2 times of cost of building it. We dun need market subsidies.  
 

S&C per month = $20 for 4 room and $30 for 5 room; not anything more than this.

wat he said is
 

if the country is doing well, property prices go up.

if the economy goes down, unemployment goes up but incomes and property values decline.
 

It is just that we all are suckers enough to still pay a raising price for a lowered-value flat during the downturns....hahaha... 
 

seriously the high price at this moment is actually due to speculation and the PRs flooding the market.......

to all the "young couples" wanting to buy HDB: 
 

you should "work like a slave" for the rest of your economical working life.
 

bear one or no child.
 

how much is the bank interest for these over priced public housing? 
 

how much you expect to sell with good profit and cover interest?
 

how long can you work?

"wow.. sian.. imagine over the weekend.. buses stop at our place.. tourists queueing to enter the sky garden early in the morning.. foodcourt full of tourists and visitors... OMG.. can i have some peace please???? 
 

ome more thing... for those who stay 27-49 lvl.. imagine.. u are late for work/school... but every lifts is full of visitors from 50 lvl (there are only 3 lifts is servicing 27fl and above).. u can consider taking staircase to lvl 25th to reach the ground floor liao.. 
 

will our place become a tourist highlight like the baiyoke sky in BKK???? 
 

i dont mind to ballot for special event to 50th floor... i think tat's pretty fair.. if not all the 1800++ families with frens and relatives all up there to party.. dont think the bridge can handle the weight... but i strongly support that public shld be excluded from the balloting.. it shld make exclusive to P@D residents only!!! 
 

During the NDP, there are thousands of pple gather at marina square to see the fireworks... not only the noise.. but after the event.. you would see tonnes of rubbish left all over the place.. gosh.. "

Must be a failure in our education system. More $$ pay to HDB is more $$ wasted. We need to remember we does not own the HDB flat, it is a 99yrs lease and not a free hold. 
 

I told my friends from other country they are really shock at the pricing and even more shock that it is a 99yrs lease hold. Our Gov should wake up thier idea soon. I am very worried on our next generation, can they even afford a bathroom....

I guess thats the hard pill to swallow for some duxton residents...paid close to half a million for a flat and expectresident exclusive facilities...only to realise it's still a HDB flat afterall....
 

What I don't get is why are they expecting anything different...don't they know they are still buying a HDB flat?



 

Yar lor. They also enjoy government subsidy  (i.e publice assistence from tax payer) and also wantt the exlcusive previledge of the private property.. How can have both?? Want exclusive, then don't receive subsidy, go private.

Ya I know but at least the pay back is much more attactive then those HDB. The main concern is the ever rising price, just thinking 20-30yrs down the road when my children wanted to start his/her family, how can they afford, by then the HDB might be price at 1mil for 4 room  .
 

Luckily I planned to move to Thailand and get away from this idiot small little island with ever increasing living standard.

do you think  they care a hoot for the future. To them with their million $$$ salary they are secure for their future only we are not secure and feel insecure. Anyway the idea of rising HDB price is just a illusion to make people feel rich. Imagine, you bought at $300K and price is now $450K naturally you feel shiok. But the problem is you can't encash it as you will not have a rooftop over you.

Plan to stay in the same place till I leave this world, so doesn't really matter to me if property drop. But it'll be good for our children next time when they start a family of their own.  But kinda worry next time for our children. Last time our parent, affordability means that they can pay back loan in full by 10-15 years. Nowadays our ministar say flat are affordable base on majority are only paying 20% of their monthly income, but he didn't specify that most are 30 yrs loan.

Those with >1 property will want the price to shoot up. Those with only HDB and cannot afford a 2nd property, will prefer HDB remain low for their next generation.

going by inflation, it is possible that public housing may hit the million mark in perhaps 20 years later, couple by market force and maybe some behind-the-scene action if you know what i mean.. anyway, lets hope that salary increases too, $20K a month could be a norm 20 years later, a million dollar house will appear affordable then.
 

lets not get too carried away, plus not lowering ourselves and curse whoever is running the show now, despite all the unpopular rules and regulations put in place, credit still goes to them for the stability the country has enjoyed since independence.. peace

Crap la ....  i have to stay near my mum so she can take care of my 17mth old son and one more boy coming next May 2010. 
 

Sold my 5rm SK house for 438K ... but then, AMK 5-rm resale are about 520 - 550k .. .. How can we normal ppl afford resales houses, esp those FTs can come in anyhow pay so high prices ... 
 

I am a pro PAP supporter, but recently have been quite demoralised due to high HDB prices. Gahmen say give birth more, but new houses so small. Resale so frigging ex! Childcare even subsidised still so ex! FTs children competing with my ah boy 10-20 yrs down the road for jobs!
 

Someone said this first wave of FTs, e.g, chinese FTs, speak little english, so doing menial work. They will want their children to work hard and learn english to compete. Hence, the next gen will face competition for school places, jobs, etc etc. I agree fully man!
 

Why we true-blue singaporean have to share the bloody pie with FTs? No offence, i have some nice FT colleagues, but ultimately, it is our survival that counts. I dun care how the gahmen does it, they have to take care of the citizens first. We have the stake in the country and have grown, sweat, and bled for it, not to count our forefathers.  We should not take second place.
 

It is affordable for those earning 10K and above. Easy to say affordable what. Last time thought at least slog to manager level hor say liao.... no need dierector level. But now, even as a manager, i find that getting that nice location HDB to be near my parents to take care of my kids, own a cheap korean car, get a maid, go on those holidays, etc, is friggin tough! 
 

I think need to go into busineess, legal or not ... sheeseh

i cant imagine taking the lift up to higher level using the normal hdb lift.



 

lol, if we all dare to wash our car at their washing bay, next time they will come up with duxton car sticker. Only those car with the sticker can wash, non resident that use the facilities will be dealt with by their own duxton security guard resident volunteer

Jurong area still quite affordable, i juz get a brand new 5 rm flat, mid flr, near jurong lake, 400m drive away from lakeside MRT at only 280k. With this pricing i no need to stretch to max 30 yrs loan, 15 to 20 yrs juz nice and comfy for my pocket.

bro, try sembawang. but not very cheap either.



 

Don't come sembawang, it's one of the worst estate, very poor facilities with pathetic bus interchange/services and sun plaza. Want go market or buy things or bank services (only OCBC) or eat better food need to go Yishun. Sun plaza is super small and overcrowded. Only accessible public transport is MRT but it always stop at Yishun or Yew Tee during peak hrs, makes me pissed off almost everyday. Lots of bicycles from residents (cos of ah tiong) and nearby shipyard, drive or walk need extra attention on them. If you stay near shipyard, sometimes house will get black dust from them, I stay in 15th storey also can get, shipyard is 24hrs so don't expect it to be very quiet at night, will hear engine sound. Seriously I can't think of any good points. 
 

Recently FTs are invading sembawang, one of the hottest spot now because it's 'cheap'. The new NTUC foodcourt at mrt station is operated 100% by ah tiong, food very expensive.
 

I stay there for 10 yrs now and when it's my turn, will not get a unit there no matter what.

I grew up in Yishun, like that place so much more. But flats are older than sembawng. Given a choice, I'll choose Yishun, no 2nd thought.

i dont understand why is it that they keep saying its affordable when the income of most singaporeans has stagnated for so long. In the end we used such a big chunk of our CPF money to pay, and then that causes us not to have enough at retiring age (god knows what is min sum 30 years later) to withdraw.. its a vicious cycle.
 

What are they thinking??!!!

Makan your CPF lah...
 

Frankly speaking.. i am surprise that after so long, there are still ppl thinking of getting money from CPF. I am only 30 Years old. But i have already given up hope of getting the CPF. I will pump all mine CPF into getting a nice big home for myself. (but do note that i will make sure that i dont use up all my CPF just in case i loss mine job.)

Food for thought:
 

HDB price are raising doesn't mean rental also goes up. The  max rental for HDB flats is directly proportional to the tenant's ability to pay.
 

Anyway, what goes up must come down. 
 

All the hoo-haa in the mass media is the make ppl kancheong spider and rush in to buy, to keep the steam engine going....until the crank shaft broken.

The Cash Plus property is only applicable for selling house. If you dont sell your house... still 123K.
 

the property part only come into picture when you sell your house after 55 YO.. then you will only put back till 123K the rest you take in cash...

oh.. rules change again? recall that the property can be served as part of the minimum sum though capped at $40k if one does not have sufficient cash in their cpf upon reaching 55.. learned that when i was doing my cmfas years ago..

They are staying with me because my mum stop work to look after my children for me. ( i dont like to hire maid... too many news liao... hard to find good one.) My father house is still under loan and he is very old liao so very hard to earn enough sufficent to live comfortably without renting out the house for extra income. (he was recently diagnose with Diabites and high protein plus exsisting High Blood pressure.) So now house rented out. But i am looking at the furture where when my children grow big and need a room by themselves...

Do note that my wish is to give my parents a good life.
 

Yes my wife is a very good wife... I am very fortunate... plus night activity is not base on once a week or months.. its base on both our mode..
