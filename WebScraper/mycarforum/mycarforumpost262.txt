Wah. If anyone can predict when interest rate increases, then he will be George Soros in disguise. Haha! Seriously, if you cannot take the heat of increasing interest rate, then either take the fixed rate or a smaller loan

approach a financial advisor who is expert in property loan.

he/she will source for you the best offer that suits you plus with a lowest interest rate, which bank is not important after all.

end of the day, he/she will get commission from the bank, not from you. don't worry. =p

variable rate is peg to bank's board rate which generally lags behind movements in sibor which can be swift and fast if fed hike rates....middle ground i think bearing in mind interest rates prohbably only have one direction to go

Can call housing loan broker, like this guy Dennis Ng appear on tv all the time http://www.housingloansg.com/web/

he can recommend you which bank got special rate etc ...
 

i tink he earns commission by recommending you to say ABC bank, 

just like when buying brand new car, when take the car loan the bank give the SE commission, 

based on the loan quantum and how many years loan, same theory.

Ask such a difficult question

Here are some stuff to digest, so once you get a rough idea what cause interest rate to rise, what are the contributing factors that influence the decision makers to raise the interest rates, what other things can be done.... then use you own gut feel if you think it will rise of fall.

Yes. But naturally you go for the lowest interest rate right?
 

higher comm maybe be needed to encourage sales. If competitive rates naturally dun need to push.

Erm, in my opinion, that is the highest rate among the 3.
 

There is no free lunch, local banks would't want take risk or losses. They will offer the fixed rates after ensuring in the worst case situation no liabilities on their side and ensure profit. The blunt? you take loh.
 

I prefer SIBOR rates... at least cost of fund + spread more transparent and predictable

Take the loan tie to Sibor. Reason being, you can monitor the sibor rate from newspaper.

If take variable rate tie to bank board rate, the bank can suka suka up their rate which we have no clue how they get that rate other than to milk us.

The current rate should be Sibor+1% = about 1.5%.

yes, your risk is Sibor movement, which could only goes up in the near future.

But at least you know you are not carrot  by the bank.
 

Congratulation, btw.

It ulitmately depends on your risk profile. Eh TS, variable or Sibor are both Floating rates leh. Or do u mean fixed vs floating?

oh BTW, i just took up a 2 year fixed with DBS. After two years, can do a restructuring. I prefer fix cos I dont have to gan keong about what happened if SIBOR move up. Anyway, SIBOR is now 0.43% and most banks are offering 0.75-0.8 + Sibor which works out to be $20 cheaper per month. Doesn't make a difference to me.

haha.. same same! Now SIBOR and SOR are low so there is a tendancy to go for floating. But like you, I rather have a piece of mind then worry about what happen when the rates go up.

No sure what you talking about in the first part. 
 

As for SIBOR + spread. 

Transparent yes, predictable no.

Depends on global economy and many other factors.

My 2 cents, this is what i used to do before the loan on my staying property became too small to refinance cheaply, so i redeemed it. 
 

Investment properties, floating rate. 

Cos after 1st year, no lock in/less or no penalty for early redemption. 

Just in case you sell or something to retain that flexibility. 
 

Staying property, fixed rate. 

There is only 1 direction for i/r to go. 

If you don't think you want to redeem the the loan within 3/5 years, its probably better to pay for some peace of mind.

Go for floating pegged to SIBOR, it's very low now and not likely to go up soon (at least till end of this year).
 

My current home loan is floating pegged to 12 mths SIBOR, 3 years tie-in period ending this July and I'm now sourcing to refinance again.  I know currently Citibank has one 1%+1 month SIBOR, can switch Sibor to 3mths, 6 mths or 12 mths anytime without penalty and unlimited times. so far I think this is the best.  If interest rate starts going up I can switch to 12 mths.
 

I find the fixed rates quoted by the banks are very high now, not worth it, but just my personal opinion.

these were the rate which DBS gave me.... my loan was taken up in April. So not sure if the below is still valid. But they didnt offer me 5 yr fixed. So I took up 2 year fixed.

Ask for documentary proof... eg: title deed would show the owner's name and IC number. When i bought my new place, i didnt deal with the owner, didnt even see him.. was dealing with the agent.. so he provided documentary proof etc

Theoretically banks can increase their lending margins even if SOR/SIBOR remains low.
 

With less properties being transacted on the overall, the fastest way for banks collectively to increase their margins is to increase the margin on the new housing loans, even though the cost of funds to them remains unchanged. This directly increases bank margins, which from an investment viewpoint, is also good for the banks. There are foreign analysts who are less optimistic about Singapore banking sector compared to other Asian banks because Singapore banks traditionally depend on housing loans for their income, and the low lending rates cause margin compression.
 

This will also help to control property prices, because it don't matter if SIBOR or SOR is 0% if all banks charge 3% + SIBOR/SOR.
 

Though fundamentally it's not free economics (it's like price fixing actually hehe), but hey, it's no different from petrol prices which always rise faster than oil prices even without adjusting for SGD appreciation. It still feels like i'm paying 50% more V-Power today for some strange reason.
 

I wonder if MAS can mandate or "strongly encourage" banks to do this? Anyone has any thoughts?
 

Though don't get me wrong, i'm not saying i endorse this idea, actually i hate it, but I'm just thinking that this might just be too easy and convenient from them to implement? Give me 0% downpayment, no seller stamp duties, low interest rates anytime man... Like China in the earlier days... Got cash rebate after 0% downpayment even betta! Then i will go shoopppinn' again!!!

With all the gov measures on housing, the high price of private housing and
 

the very rate of cash needed for the deposit,
 

the TS must be financially well off and savvy.
 

The last thing he or she needs is advice from us
 

on financing.
 

Its us that need to ask the TS how to make more
 

money to buy more private properties.
