Sydney too late liao. Mel saturated. Tokyo still got some puff but political risk as the japs change PM more often than change underwear (oz starting to go that way too).
 
Some say gold coast bottomed out n poised for the next upside. The PRCs r starting to take interest there too.

from a saturation point of view. Assuming I go in. Would it not be a discounted price of 30% due to the drop in currency or am I missing something?

You can buy in Gold Coast or Brisbane (heard it is moving) and still enjoy the "discounted price of 30% due to the drop in currency".  Not sure about Sydney (at record high) but Melbourne is definitely facing oversupply.

For property, buy today at AUD1M doesn't guarantee u AUD1.3M in future, esp after taxes (which is sibei high if you're non resident n cannot offset taxable income) n potential mkt correction (esp Sydney & Mel).
 
Ultimately, it's your call.

30 % currency drop from around 2011.
 
Vs price increase of X% from 2011? 
 
It depends on which state, property type,  you are looking at to have a more meaningful discussion.

In my humble opinion, only invest in the main CBD area if you are looking for investment. Otherwise, money is king if you are not going to stay there.
 
Why lock up your money while you could easily enjoy it? Australia is a huge country not the tiny red dot like us.

Singaporean businessman buys Australian island for $5.5 million: Report
CNBC Tuesday, May 31, 2016
 
 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoNDTRnNPsQ
YouTube screen
 
 
Always fancied a private bolthole for vacations away from the city bustle?
 
One Singaporean businessman clearly did, so much so that he reportedly spent almost 5.5 million Australian dollars (S$5.5 million) on an island off the coast of Tasmania, according to a report by Australia's national broadcaster ABC.
 
For less than the cost of many condos in Singapore - which in March topped the Economist Intelligence Unit's "world's most expensive city" list for the third straight year - the unnamed man purchased Waterhouse Island, a 300-hectare island about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) off the northeast coast of the Australian state.
 
The island came with a three-bedroom main house, a guest cottage, sheep-shearing shed, airstrip, permanent power supply and mobile phone reception, the ABC reported.
 
It could, however, only be accessed only by charter flight or boat, according to the property's sales listing on real estate site domain.com.au.
 
Property agent Ant Manton of Ray White told the ABC that he believed the buyer planned to use it as a holiday destination.
 
"I think down the track there might be some plans for an eco-tourism type development but at this stage just a magnificent private retreat in the middle of Bass Strait," Manto said.

The issue with investing in Australia is you can only sell to a local when you want to exit. For places like Melbourne,  I was also told that inner city living is less desired compared to outskirts like south yarra.

Well at 0.998 or 1 to 1 is as good level as we can get. AUD is having rounding bottom. Barring any USD hike in Jun(only 20% chance) and decent Aussie data, I dun think we shd not hope for further SGD gain or loss to consider when investing in Australia. Rather look for the potential upside for property price gain. Some states have run more than others so we just have to look for areas/pockets that still offer greater investment opportunity and returns.

this you are so correct,
..........none of the sales team says these things when we visited the launch in SG.
 
had back in 1992 bought a bungalow at Gold Coast, Runaway Bay..........damn difficult to sell, locals generally prefer to rent closer to their working places.
 
rental credited weekly, so weekly measly A$ still have to deduct 7% for estate management agent to look after affairs, ....no damn shiok again.
 
wait tenant complain weather too hot grass dry turn brown, too much rain turn mouldy, pipe leak, tap leak, light don't work this and that....estate agent send photos and say must change, so change, change, change and more change.
 
after 3 years or so, heng lor got a Vietnamese family with Aussie status bought over .....my end, breaking even financially was extremely fine with me,...since one headache less.
 
imho and I say this from my own experience only (so don't generalize or quote me), waste time investing there lor..........anyway not too fond of down under or the Aussies for that matter,.... can be quite racist at times.
 
perhaps these days things are done differently which in this case.....
maybe it was just me that was unlucky,...a case of either wrong time or wrong place

My rental returns is close to 10% in the first year (tax free). I am in my second year now. Thailand is the only place you can buy a property for SGD150k and rent between $1.5k & $2k a month during peak season. My advice is target the beach resorts.

When buying, it is important to have an exit strategy... if you need to sell for whatever reason. It's true that many Aussies prefer to live outside of the CBD (it's better for outdoor activities), so when it comes time to resell, you'll have to sell to a local (they are the most active in the market, anyway). There are still good options for Aus, but I would keep away from certain areas (Melbourne's CBD for one).
 
Thailand can have some interesting options with rental returns - but it's important to go with reputable developer... smaller / no experience developers are rife and if they can't get the required sales (they usually can't as they have little to no experience) and may just run off with the deposit. Other places in SEA are worth a look, too... like Cambodia.

Yes given the currency exchange rate right now of close to SG$1 to AU$1. My friend's daughter went to study at Melbourne around February this year and he bought a one bedroom and one bathroom apartment for her to stay at Box Hill at less then SG$500k. Middle city of Melbourne he says worth it wor.
Ya la he is super rich those type  He told me after his daughter graduated he can rent that place out to foreign students since most are from Asia because Box Hill is famous as "Chinatown" of Melbourne. Some more the development is by a Singapore developer maybe thats why la he dare to put in money there. Cheers just sharing ~

Box HIll is more than 10km from Melbourne CBD.  Somemore Melbourne Chinatown is in Little Bourke St (Junction of Elisabeth St to Exhibition St.
 
The only reason he bought the apartment there is because your fren daughter studies at Deakin Uni.
 
If really got $$$, go & buy at South Bank lah.

That's not $$$ splashing hor.  It is a smart move as real estate in Melbourne is getting more & move expensive.
 
Your fren can even make a profit from the sale of that place once his daughter graduate.

Australia has too much land and the landed properties in each locality appeals to only a small niche market n you would be facing an uphill task finding buyers. Just look at Reapfield who are marketing those cheap bungalows in some ulu part of Melbourne, aud300k n still many plots left unsold. My advice id to thread with caution coz cheap doesn't mean investable.

Perth bah, but my experience also limited. The house was passed on to me in okay shape but needed some work, initially I rented out to a friend at low rent but I went back and cleared it up made it more habitable for renting out. Off the top of my head some things I noted were
 
- Garden is a pain if got trees need to constantly trim, big trees cost a bomb to take down. If possible try to have a minimalism garden, unfortunately mine had a fair sized garden and I didn't get a chance to concrete it up lol
- Good neighbors are important, over there cars cheap and my neighbors son had like 4 cars but they always parked in decently as not obstruct me, in fact my current tenant took my property cause her neighbor had 4/5 cars and a boat which made it hard for her to get in and out.
- Security is important, alarm or grilled windows are good. Keeps the insurance premium low.
- These average houses tend to attract stable tenants (mostly local Aussies), condo's usually more single professionals but can also be problematic if they lose their jobs.
- Also average type houses tenants are less fussy about wear and tear
- Rent terms are usually short i.e 6 months to year 
- Good management agent is important (<-this is the most important), usually the house has a fair bit of maintenance (i.e roof get leaves chocking the pipes, garden trimming, roofing tiles crack, garage door motor maintenance etc which need regular inspection and upkeep). Even the fire alarm requires yearly inspections and sign off to confirm working
- Also my management agent gets landlord insurance for me on top of regular insurance, it covers me if the tenant damages things in the house and loss of rental etc.
- Area you buy, some areas are real sh*tholes and it pays to know this well. One street could be a decent family neighborhood and two streets away could resemble some redneck heaven. Of course if you buy a luxury house this will unlikely to be an issue since the whole neighborhood will be quite pricey anyway.
 
But rental returns are not great, if you are borrowing money locally to rent the income will likely not offset the interest cost, again which is why many Aussies prefer renting to buying. 
 
Also I know an indo lady who bought a simple house and turned it into a mini student hostel, it was near the uni and she was making a mint. Just the rooms/house no food, washing or anything. Downside is have to deal with students (worse Singaporean students lol)

- Good neighbors are important, over there cars cheap and my neighbors son had like 4 cars but they always parked in decently as not obstruct me, in fact my current tenant took my property cause her neighbor had 4/5 cars and a boat which made it hard for her to get in and out.
- Security is important, alarm or grilled windows are good. Keeps the insurance premium low.
- These average houses tend to attract stable tenants (mostly local Aussies), condo's usually more single professionals but can also be problematic if they lose their jobs.
- Also average type houses tenants are less fussy about wear and tear
- Rent terms are usually short i.e 6 months to year 
- Good management agent is important (<-this is the most important), usually the house has a fair bit of maintenance (i.e roof get leaves chocking the pipes, garden trimming, roofing tiles crack, garage door motor maintenance etc which need regular inspection and upkeep). Even the fire alarm requires yearly inspections and sign off to confirm working
- Also my management agent gets landlord insurance for me on top of regular insurance, it covers me if the tenant damages things in the house and loss of rental etc.
- Area you buy, some areas are real sh*tholes and it pays to know this well. One street could be a decent family neighborhood and two streets away could resemble some redneck heaven. Of course if you buy a luxury house this will unlikely to be an issue since the whole neighborhood will be quite pricey anyway.
 
But rental returns are not great, if you are borrowing money locally to rent the income will likely not offset the interest cost, again which is why many Aussies prefer renting to buying. 
 
Also I know an indo lady who bought a simple house and turned it into a mini student hostel, it was near the uni and she was making a mint. Just the rooms/house no food, washing or anything. Downside is have to deal with students (worse Singaporean students lol)
Thanks. really informative. Learnt a lot.  
Wah even fire alarm must be maintained yearly

If ur really keen drop me a message, will help where I can Perth only though.
 
Yeah and the fire alarm must be hardwired type and installed by a qualified electrician (got cert leh cannot play not some ah seng), cannot just put a battery operated one haha. 
 
But I have to say the management agents there are super pro, if you got a good one literally can just leave it to them. They send me a semi annual with pictures and comments on what the tenant did not clean (i.e did not cut grass, did not clean the over) knn they even take pic of the toilet, heng it was flushed   
 
And when taking on a tenant other management companies will also give you a detailed report with pictures and how they maintained the property etc. But as said if you get a regular house easy to find regular stable tenants with such reports, only problem is finding a simple decent suburb house near to the city which is foreigner eligible will be the challenging part cause all the areas around cities are matured estates (foreigner can only buy new)

Got some kind comments on my post and I came across the report send to me so thought I elaborate bit further on home types and issues.
 
These days quite popular to buy houses with shared driveway, this was the one my tenant got. In all it looks decent on google map

 
This was the issue she faced after, apparently there is more but maybe the owner went to work, so all the stuff on the right belongs to one family. Who apparently has 3 boats and several cars.

 
This house resembles mine, solo driveway so less issues with the neighbors and in all its actually a decent retirement home, circa about 500k AUD. Its not an expensive neighborhood. 

 
This house is what I consider upscale (better neighborhood) prices are about 1 M plus (or more), land size is roughly the same. Self stay mainly not worth to rent out.

 
Of course as all things prices will be driven by location but you will find a variety of home styles in any neighborhood but the more upscale the fancier the houses as all things.

Unlike HDB common corridor, you can park car on your own lawn.
 
It is fire hazard if you try to park anything huge in HDB common corridor.
