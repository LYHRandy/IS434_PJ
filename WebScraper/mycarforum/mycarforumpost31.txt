Guys, I cant seem to get a definite answer on this. I'm planning to sell my existing place n move nearer to my kids' school. A friend is saying I should take the opportunity to get a HDB resale; as in my wife buy a resale HDB and I buy the condo but each of us has to finance each property individually.
 
Is this allowed?

What you are refering to is decoupling. But to even qualify to buy a resale HDB, you got to form a family nucleus or qualify under some other schemes that I am not so sure (you can check hdb website). So, it means your name will probably be used as an occupier, hence may not have vested interest in private properties if you did not meet MOP (correct me if I am wrong).
 
I have friends who did decoupling, and usually they bought 2 private properties under their own names.

Bro, what you actually want...? You want to siam ABSD?
 
Your case; If you sell you existing HDB, the resale HDB you going to buy, must buy together with your wife. This is HDB rule. 
Buying HDB resale, you need to fulfilled one of the conditions... citizenship, age, family nucleus, special condition...
 
It is obvious that you are under family nucleus scheme. So you have to buy with your wife.
 
So, if, after you bought the resale HDB with your wife and fulfilling the MOP, you two can buy private properties.
 
Previously, in order to siam ABSD, many couple decouple. But this decouple rule had changed since 2016 April. So, under normal condition decoupling is not allow. 
 
My 2 cents worth.

as the other forummers have pointed out. U need to be part of a family nucleus to buy a resale HDB.
 
If u buy under a single name, u have to be single essentially.

Im staying in a condo now. original intention is just to sell current and buy another condo. But a friend said y not buy a HDB & a condo at the same time so that's y I search around if possible. Some ppl say can some cannot.
 
So for my case, if I want to buy 2 properties and avoid any additional fees/taxes, is to buy 2 private properties?
 
and if I buy HDB, I need to stay for 5 years before buying a condo even if I pay full for the HDB?

you can't remove your name after that 5 years.
u still will incur 7% ABSD for any PC purchase subsequently (based on current rules). Why would u want to pay 7% to govt for no reason?
Might as well choose 2 PC within your means and save that 7% right.
 
Basically if u want to have 2 properties, an HDB is not the best option to be 1 of these 2 properties right now.

OK.. if private property will be very much easier...
 
in order to have 2 properties and without paying ABSD... there are ways...
 
first... your current condo under whose name... under your name or your wife name (in another word, only one name in the property) then it easy, the other parties name not in the property, go buy another one... no ABSD involve. This is very straight forward.
 
If the current condo under both name... the question will ask is, is the condo fully paid already?
If it is fully paid, then either party can give the private property as gift to the other party. (normal stamp duty and gift deed tax need to paid). So the party without name, can go buy properties without paying ABSD. 
 
If the current condo under both name and it is not fully paid:
2 of you can do part-purchase for de-coupling the property. Meaning either one party buy over the other party property share. So the property become only having one name. (normal stamp duty still apply, but this method pay lesser)
So after removing the party name, he or she can buy property without paying ABSD.
 
Do remember, the normal tax is based on the current property market value. Banker needs to do valuation. For part-purchase, the tax paid is based on the portion, not the full amount. Do remember, if the property payment (down-payment, progressive payment, installation and etc,) involve the CPF, then it is require to return the amount back to the CPF.
 
If you are serious, find a law firm and check it out. we can only given general advice.
 
my 2 cents worth.

Even if you buy HDB first, you still have to wait 5 years MOP and also pay 7% ABSD on PC.
 
You cannot buy a condo and HDB at the same time.

A short answer is NO.
 
HDB Resale must have both names. So if you buy HDB, you certainly have to wait for MOP to be over before you can buy another private (and pay ABSD). Now this route is only possible if you or your wife is a Singaporean. If both PR, then sorry, you cannot own a HDB resale and private property at the same time.
 
For decoupling, not every couple also can decouple. It has conditions so this have to be check first. 
 
PM me if you are serious about Portfolio restructuring.

I still confuse on the different level of sale levy.
 
If you sold much earlier in 1995 and now wants to buy a HDB vs you sold in 2010 and now wants to buy resale to payback HDB ...
 
One has a capped amount, one has a compounded amount.

There is another method to reduce the ABSD. 
Hint. Buy with a parent who does not have a property. You have to have loads of moolah to do it though cos more complicated. Any agent worth his salt should know.....

I would advise buying an hdb n wait out the mop if you wish to earn rental income in future coz hdb rental is hard to beat unless you are talking about overseas pty. If you are scared that you will miss out in the pty mkt, can always buy a commercial pty (industrial space,  not retail).

If you buy a HDB for rental after MOP then how are you going to buy a PP in the future?
 
With ABSD, I don't see it being worth it at all.

I agree...the market has not fully corrected UPWARDS...its only just started moving up in terms of number of transactions and prices (resale, new sale, land price that Developers are paying to govt).So do listen to bears and wait some more.  Pls don’t listen to agents, analysts as ONLY they are vested. Bears have no secret agenda for prices to be low.

A few years ago, HDB rental yield typical calculation is 6 or 7% rental yield, a condo rental yield is 4% while a landed House may be 2%.
 
Supposing the public housing prices stay stagnant and private housing doubles, we are still looking at 6% (public) versus 2% condo and 1% house.
 
Going by rental yield one will still go for HDB and not private, even if there is much more room for appreciation. Conversely, if the price of private halves while public stays the same, would we say now go for condo because it’s yield is 8% followed by HDB at 6% followed by landed at 4%?
 
Conclusion: rental yield is a part of the picture, but it should never be the sole consideration especially if one's intention is to stay.

Well last i checked, HDB does not build GCB.  And TS was considering HDB / Condo....thus i asked LPPL please show us which ppty yield 0.1% rental.  If not its just another case of fake news.
 
Years ago i remembered when i bought a resale Maplewoods 3 bedder, rental was $2,500 / month. The unit cost was close to $1m. Subsequently the unit was leased out at ever increasing rental value until my last renewal where i kept it flat.This is despite the fact the condo was right in front of massive works due to the construction of DTL.
 
Fast forward to 2018, it is still commanding $4,200 / month and my downstairs neighbour sold it for $2.1m. While the rental yield based on current value is in the Low 2% (certainly not 0.1% lol) but base on historical value it’s 5%.  Some jokers will come and tell me rent will drop, massive supply etc.  So let me ask, even if it drops to $2,300 / month, the yield is 1.3% (certainly not 0.1%).  However, lets not forget even a 5Rm HDB is going for $3k rental around Toh Yi area and i have not even considered inflation or the recent rule change that cap the number of persons staying at 4rm flat and above at 6 pax.  
 
So tell me, will HDB or condo yield drop to 0.1% lol.  Anyway like i said, Bear, `Miss the Boat’ people will always be behind the curve.  When price was dropping, they hope for it to go lower. When it’s rising, they say it will drop.  Anyway it’s good, less competition in the market for buyers lol

You don't know what is a figure of speech? If market is going to "correct upwards" further as what you mentioned, we are looking at a very pathetic yield, hence 0.1% is used to highlight my point. Didn't expect people to take things so literally in a forum...lol

when we calculate rental yield, do we use bought price or current price? 
I thought we use current price
 
theoretically net yield can go below 1%?

It’s really up to you. 
If you have no intention to sell at any reasonable price, can use your buying price.
 
But if you benchmark against potential selling price or trying to gauge opportunity costs for your funds instead, can use current price.

Of coz I know lol but 0.1%? You might as well stretch it figuratively and say negative yield. We all know who are the big ppty bears here...yourself, throttleB and a few others.  
 
The thing is, bears and those with agenda for prices to be low (miss the boat, sellers who sold too early hoping to buy back etc) will always find excuses to shout low.  They want to justify their past actions or ‘analysis’.  Eventually they will get it right coz nothing goes up forever but after the drop, the low could still be higher than the previous low.  Seriously, are you afraid of competition that whenever there are interests to buy, you discourage people from buying? Lol
 
Not to mention loss of rental income opportunities or paid rental to landlord while waiting for durians to drop.

But if you take that stretch, just the appreciation gain (without considering yields) is going to make some people numb in their fingers.
 
Moreover, as supply and demand balances together, it is also highly likely that price will not run away on its own without rental following. 
 
A more balanced tug-of-war scenario should appear soon, moving more and more in favour of private properties until both sides are balanced.

renovation is sibei subjective ... you can throw in $50K-$70K to make it looks nice
buyer don't like the design or talk down the cabinet not nice la ...  this and that ... will lowball the price

When we calculate rental yield, can use either purchase price or current price. 
 
If using purchase price, it will be called "yield on cost" or "yield on purchase price". If on current price, it will be called the usual rental yield or variations e.g. current rental yield, yield on market price etc.
 
This is what I know from talking to friends in the real estate investment industry
