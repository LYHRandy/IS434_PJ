Well done Patrcik !

June 17, 2008 
 
Valuation the culprit in artificially inflating HDB flat prices  
 
OVER the past 18 to 24 months, HDB resale property prices have shot through the roof and many lower-income families have been priced out of the market. Although this is partly driven by the shortage of HDB flats and increased demand, what is not apparent to many people is the manner in which valuations have artificially fuelled inflation. 
Take the three-room flat, for example. This is the smallest HDB flat and is targeted at the lower-income group. 
 
Between March and May, prices of a three-room flat in Yishun, in the same block and with the same floor area, have shot up by between $18,000 and $30,000. The price of a similar three-room flat in Ang Mo Kio ranges from $184,000 to $300,000 in the same period. Similar trends are observed in almost every estate and in almost every flat type. 
 
I accept that several factors may account for the differential in the value of a property, but is it realistic to expect the valuation of the same type of flat in the same block to have risen by 10 to 50 per cent over a short three month period? Even if the interior renovation of a unit is particularly good, could it account for such a difference? And why does the trend keep increasing? A check with several properties in the weekend classifieds shows that the valuation of similar properties in these locations has gone up by at least another $10,000 since the last transacted prices last month. What can justify the drastic increases? 
 
A three-room flat in a choice location, such as Bishan and Ang Mo Kio, now costs more than $300,000. A two-bedroom private apartment in an older development costs only slightly more - a clear sign that HDB flats are over-priced and out of reach for some lower-income families. 
 
It seems that, in valuing a property, the valuer takes the last transacted price as a benchmark. Since the last transacted price includes the cash top-up sellers usually demand from buyers, the value of the property is artificially inflated.
 
Past experience in Singapore and Britain shows that when property prices are artificially inflated by valuation, sooner or later, prices will crash and many people will suffer. 
 
The HDB should bar inclusion of the cash top-up in valuations.

Yah!! This is what an agent told me...
 
I was like WTF??? Does that mean if an idiot pay 400k for a 5room flat at Jurong West then Jurong west 5 room in that area will be valued around 400k? His answer is YES!!!
 
I did realise that those 5room flat in Bukit Panjang that was valued in March is around 290k. Those done in May is 300k (Be it 2nd floor, 4th floor, 9th floor)  all 300k.
And guess what... the latest transacted price in the area is averagely 300k in the past 2 months... This is really a stupid way to value a house.
 
Anyone who don't believe can go to any 5room flat in Bukit Panjang to have a look...all valuation done after April are 300k be it 2nd floor or 10th floor.
 
Valuer simply come take photo and put 300k in the report... easy $$$ 
 
Or is it the work of Housing agent or even the Housing Deaprtment behind it to hold HDB resale price

Yup... Viewed a unit my wife and I liked near my in law's place just 2 days ago... The place has just been advertised on sat and the agent tried to "smoke" us and said that there's already a 35K offer on the flat... I just replied so what's the owner waiting for since COV is negotiable? He a bit stunned by my remarks and tried to recover by saying the valuation is not out so the buyer is waiting... I wanted to say so the offer valid or not? Or just some figure you pluck from the air so that I can counter offer? 
 

Sigh... Young punk lah that fella...

Can't imagine a 10+ year old, 5 room falt in jurong east to be around 500K 
 
Right now, a brand new, freehold, 2 bedroom condo, 500 meters from dhoby ghaut is only $950K. 
 
I think there is some serious price disparity. Clearly fom the price of prime district condos vs HDB flats in suburb areas, I can see a major correction is heading our way.

===================
 
Later they build houses on Pulau Ubin or Pulau Serangoon & expect u to live there & commute by ferry every day. Park your car at designated CP for a very high price.
 
And those houses wil b sold at a premium cos they say u r buying "waterfront" property & they r always very expensive.
 
Something like what they did to Ponggol. Hyped it up to sound like u buy a place there & it's like living in a resort. Hahaha Now so many pple bought expensive flats there regret cos got no facilities & flats r damm small. Roads r always jammed during peak times.
 
Sometimes I feel sorry for those kenna makan but then maybe it takes something like this for them to learn their lesson.

renovation is taken into consideration but does not have huge impact on final valution..
 
for example, two units in same block with identical facing and floor level..if one unit is very well renovated compared to the other, say the renovation cost 80k and the other barely renovated, the valuation will be only abt 10K or so higher max...it will not be like 30-40K difference..if owner wants to sell his unit high due to extensive reno, he can only ask for more Cash on top of valuation but he can't expect valuation of his unit to be a lot higher.

To be frank, it could be real as $ is not the only factor. For the owner want to accept any offer for his/her home, time and extra cond is the 2 other important factors that should also go in hand in hand with $$.

they all play on our fears that we cannot afford to buy later if we wait.
can't be helped, gahmen like peasants to play this game, chase all property price in sg up to the stratosphere so that we think sg land is very valuable. have a stake in this place, even if it means paying for the hdb for the next 30 years, even though the lease is 99 years. might as well rent.

Jurong and sengkang flat also inflated quite a lot, its not cheap. If wanna compare to other places of coz will be cheap, if wanna compare like tat, i can say the amk bishan tpy house is so much cheaper den orchard apartment etc.. I also agree tat the valaution thing is killing ppl, clementi new flat over half a year can increase 100k plus for a 1 and 2 storey flat to a whoppi ng480k plus, its a new flat, not resale. All becoz they build a new interchange and reno the town center etc. Jurong area will be the same after the jurong lake district development. Now my 30 yrs old plus flat valuation shot up to 380k. After they reallly build the CBD area thing over here, i believe it will shoot up even more. Sometime i see so many upgrading gg on, i also feel sorry for the sporean, once they build something nearby, the area valuation will shoot up a lot, the more they build, the more they earn.

But always got some idiots who cannot count or think they won't live long enough to see the CPF money cos kenna locked by govt will "abuse" their CPF funds thinking it is untouchable money.
 
And there are others who think the CPF is a "die die" must max out account. So year after year, upgrade and upgrade. (pls think abt the fxxking stamp duty and whose pocket it goes into). They neber stop to see if CPF account enuff $$ to do so many fxxk things then one day kenna cashflow problem...how? see MP lor. If i am the MP, ask tt idiot go fxxk spider.

if above valuation then, u can't get bank/hdb to finance the above valuation portion.
 
If too far below valuation, then maybe must say why to make the transaction is above board cos no seller in their right mind will sell way below valuation. The bank also scared if got something fishy.

If Julong & SK price go up
then it logical to assume the mature estates also up by agar agar same proportion.
 
The only ones who lose out are those hunting for a new home. Those who have a home and want to upgrade may buy high now but also sell high.

Punggol not that bad lah, with the venetian style development due to transform the estate in a few years time. Those who bought their flats earlier can consider themselves quite lucky liao. Think prices are going to climb as the facilities are in operation.Yup. Just hope it will happen,,,not like from P21>P21+...maybe they need P21++, P21+++ before it will materialize.

But the same mechanism works as well when units are sold BELOW valuation.... and as long as less and less buyers are willing to pay high COV, the sellers may reduce asking, leading to lower COV/sales price below valuation ...
 
I see the valuation as a moving datum of the mean value transacted prices  of a similar unit.... end of the day, valuation just throws up a number. It's still up to the buyer/seller to agree to buy/sell.

COV is BS. anyhow hutt one. all agent will try to pull a fast one tell you COV up and latest transaction even higher. 
they all play on our fears that we cannot afford to buy later if we wait.
can't be helped, gahmen like peasants to play this game, chase all property price in sg up to the stratosphere so that we think sg land is very valuable. have a stake in this place, even if it means paying for the hdb for the next 30 years, even though the lease is 99 years. might as well rent.

 
BS or not up to you to judge....  I have units that value used to be only 480k at mid 2007 and now the value is 610k ... you judge yourself ...

want to sabo your neighbour ?  
sell your flat to your son at $1  
 
next day, all your neighbour will come with a chopper in hand  

 
i think once the bxxxxxds value your flat at a certain price, you cannot offer too much  below the valuation price. so $1 is out of the question. (correct me if i am wrong)
HDB will reject
 
average couple total income 6k, buy a 4 room for 300k. monthly 1k plus installment.
you tell me end of 30years how much they got left in their cpf??? 
 
i think less then 70k. how to retire???
 
this is crazy.... 4 room should not cost more then 250k and 5 room should no cost more then 350k

HDB will not reject provided you return back your CPF money taken to purchase this unit.  so in another words ... you are only able to sell this unit at $1 if your current flat is given to you as a gift means it is 0 cost to you in the first place.

If the market is good, COV is usually involved... When the market is no good, people will sell at valuation or below... 
 

It's not a rule that we must sell at valuation... Valuation is just a guide on how much your flat is worth... You can definately sell below that or at any price that's agreeable by yourself and the buyer...

with the extra money in hand, they buy more expensive pigeon hole. its a vicious cycle.

Yep .. confirm can .. it is just that HDB will ask both side to go for an interview to make sure no private arrangement and they would "advice" you to go for a transfer instead of a sell so as to protect the market.
 
Anyway when the market is good... with the extra money owners should downgrade and cash out the money to prevent higher lost at bigger value items when the times turn bad .... however those that no choice got to upgrade, might incur higher lost when they are selling at the low time.
 
I doubt the recession like in 1998 will hit us ... but I believe things like SARS in 2003, sept 11, might have a higher chance of hitting us thus causing the down turn of everything.

alot are doing the opposite..
 
my colleague sold CCK 5 room for 430K(he bought the flat 10 years ago at 190K) and bought a condo recently
 
if HDB keep new flats at a low price instead of following market trends, we will never see such amazing prices for flats.
 
they got no right to follow market trends. use taxpayer money to earn more money from taxpayer. its worse then banks

Bro, what is your opinion on the HDB stopping production of new flats, and now releasing only on Build To Order basis?
 
URA is now releasing more and more private condo land in the suburbs.  Check the URA website: a lot of condo land scheduled to be sold in the suburbs.
 
Is it the aim of the Govt to shift a higher number of Singaporeans into private estates, and leaving the existing number of HDB for the new immigrants like PRC, Indian, and Myanmar, Malaysian, PR, etc.
 
This is what I think the Govt's aim is:  enable existing Singaporeans to upgrade to private condo (which is most Singaporeans' dream), enable poorer new immigrants to buy HDB. Achieve 6 million population, at the same time guarantee the vote for the elections.  Everybody happy.

Reduce excess inventory. lower supply so that ppl will be force to take less undesireable locations. 
 
Safeguard own's margin by building only when needed. 4 years is a long wait.
 
"URA is now releasing more and more private condo land in the suburbs. Check the URA website: a lot of condo land scheduled to be sold in the suburbs."
 
why waste time building flats when private developer willing to pay high price for land.
But i agree with you more and more ppl want to buy condo. 
 
"Is it the aim of the Govt to shift a higher number of Singaporeans into private estates, and leaving the existing number of HDB for the new immigrants like PRC, Indian, and Myanmar, Malaysian, PR, etc. "
 
How high is high? 80% of ppl still live in HDB flats. excess immigrants(i dun mind if they convert to citizens but most of them only PR and buy so next time go back home country sell flats can earn money) only push up the price further
 
"This is what I think the Govt's aim is: enable existing Singaporeans to upgrade to private condo (which is most Singaporeans' dream)"
 
i think only at most only 40%  singaporeans can make it. The rest still struggling

IMO his argument on valuation been the cause of HDB price increase is completely off the mark. No one forces buyer to buy at valuation or above valuation, valuation is just a guide based on similar transactions done earlier.  
 

During the downturn, prices are often below valuation, no one complains then that valuation is causing price depression. 
 

Going back to basics, clearly the price is hugely sensitive to demand and supply. Want to blame, blame HDB for reducing the supply and coming out with stoopid scheme like BTO. Also blame the many FT looking to buy HDB, one will be surprised how many PR HDB buyers there are nowadays.

I dun think the writer is exactly wrong...a lot of high transacted prices is due to extreme cases of excessively high cash over valuation which is brought about by some cash rich pte condo en bloc owners(who decide to downgrade to hdb and keep the money) who can agree to pay 150K abv valuation...but majority of hdb buyers in the market does not and will not be willing to pay that kind of money and overall, the cash rich owners who bought a marine parade flat for 750K and another one who bought a Tiong Bahru flat for 720K does not represent majority of the population..when valuation is based a lot on last transacted prices, then the extreme high cash over valuation is build into current valuation..then when the valuation which alr contains this high COV portion is out, the prices is even more out of the market when the owners demands another 60-70K cash on top of this alr inflated valuation..
 
Valuation using last transacted price can be fair if they take out the few extreme cases of high cash abv valuation and take the average as the guide..  Not sure how they did it though..

how do you then determine the actual demand? 
 
if a seller asks for a price that there is no demand, he will just have to lower his price, whatever the valuation will be, no? converse, if the buyer asks for a price where there is no supply, he will just have to up his price.

I don't think the writer is alluding to just the exceptional cases. He also mentioned Yishun, and i don't think there's any en bloc in Yishun. 
 

The basic premise is that valuation does not take into account present demand and supply, only past demand and supply. Coz no one can predict the present or future.  
 

So if en bloc buyers was pushing the market up, then valuation should rightly reflect the (past) reality without discrimination. No one knows if there will be any more such cash rich buyers vying for your dream flat (now) right?  
 

HDB valuation only rises drastically in the last 1 or 2 months, earlier valuation was still not as high, but cash portion was very high. Now valuation has increased, cash has gone down while total price stablises. This observation also runs contrary to the writer's points.  
 

For the same price, i will rather high valuation low cash, never low valuation high cash.

the valuation only covers what the valuers think the property is worth.
 
the actual worth is where the horse's mouth is (so to speak) and that is the amt of $$ the buyer is willing to fork out.
 
valuations will not take outliers when they value the flat. When the mkt is bullish (it is still),pple will pay. that is how the decision is made as to who gets what.

why I say the demand is actually not tat high as it seems? when news came out of record breaking deals where pple paid 100-150K cash on top of valuation, most owners in prime located hdb flats all started to demand nothing less than 90-100K COV..does everyone seriously think majority of hdb dwellers in singapore even for those who is well off enough to own HDB flats in prime located areas can afford that amount? most cannot afford..most of such high COV deals were brought abt by cash rich singaporeans who disposed their current property at a high price and use it to buy..in another words, its not entirely true tat the inflated prices were due to extreme high demand(of cos high demand is also one factor)..rather, part of the reason was due to some record breaking deals which help the prices to increase at a faster rate (if it was not some news that came out of buyers forking out 100-150K cash in record deals, would so many owners dare hold buyers to 'ransom' by asking for such cash level?)..
 
there are mainly three criterias in how valuers do their valuation:
 
a)Location of flat. availability of amenities nearby and etc. Facing and floor level
b)Condition of flat. how well kept it is. any renovation?
c)Last transacted prices in previous quarter
 
(a) and © are the main criteria. (b) has little influence on the final valuation figure.
 
IMO, if © is to be used, record breaking deals which far exceeds the normal selling price recorded in tat area should be excluded from consideration. after excluding these transactions, the average of the transacted prices which falls within the 'normal range' is to be taken as the basis (those abnormally on the low side shld be excluded also, but this is rare in 07 and 08). 
 
Iam very surprised to learn that in around mid 2007, the valuation of a high flr 5rm kim tian rd flat is 570-580K..in 2nd quarter 2008, the valuation shot up to abt 100K and reach around 670-680k. So this 670-680k alr seems to include a large part of the COV portion but just happen to be build into valuation..then the owner again demand another 70-80K on top of this value..so, its a bit like two rounds of COV heap onto it, isn't it?? with such way of valuation, not surprising indeed that current hdb prices is still so high despite market starting to cool down for last couple of months..in the depot rd area which my fren live in, there was a 34 yr old flat which was sold for 628K..I was like..??

I din really follow the exact details in his letter...so the part on Yishun and stuff like tat I din really know..but if let's say the valuers does indeed just take last transacted prices as one of the chief mechanism wholesale, then its not gonna be reflective of the real situation..but of cos, to be fair, the exact mechanism of how they go about doing it, I dun exactly know the details..

Valuation is based on past prices of similar location, block and floor.  
 

The choice is (always) with the buyer. If the buyer insists to vie those choice units with others who are richer, then why complain the valuation is "unfair", no one forces you to buy leh. 
 

 If buyer goes for 2nd floor & ulu location unit, i'm sure no en-bloc buyers will buy  and one won't be affected by the so-called unfair valuation lor.

What a loser! 
Price increase is determined by market forces. HDB prices hv been left so much far behind the private ones for the last two years. So, any price increase in this sector is more than welcome and justifiable.
 
Moreover, who has to guarantee that housing prices hv to remain affordable to the lowest income group. Even in HK up to 30% of the population are rental and do not afford to buy their own house. So, if you can't afford to buy then rent, don't complain. No country in the world can guarantee a 100% home ownership to it people. It's a worldwide phenomena, which Singaporean has taken it for granted all this while.

But hor, when so much news came out of wat is sold at which level and etc, it creates false impression majority of singaporeans is cash rich and it is contagious in tat this optismism will get rubbed onto owners, even for those staying in JW, BP who all started to think their flat can be sold at 30-40K abv valuation..unfortunately, even for many young couples, a JW flat at 30K valuation is still out of reach for them..so its like LL no choice but to consider only low flr units?? this optimism may not have been realised if valuation had gone up at a more steady rather than at an accelerated pace..

Serious seller will price to sell depending on one's time horizon. So ultimately it is still demand and supply.  
 

In fact, valuation should have risen earlier, then buyer esp young ones will not be put off by the high cash asking amount.

Well I find it is not really the criterias that that affects the valuation now.
 
I would say it is the methods of the valuation being used.
There are simply 1)Cost, 2)Income, 3)Residual, 4)Profits and 5)Direct Comparison Method.
 
It is just that most valuers would use the 5th Method which is the Direct Comparison Method. However to be fair, using the Direct Comparison should be one of the prefered method as the rest, besides Cost Method is mainly talking about returns.
 
However I find the key point in the property the affects the value should be 1)Land Price, 2)Age of Property, 3)Height, 4)Amenities.  For Condition, it affect very little.

I find currently age of property seem to matter little when it comes to valuation...
 
I was surprised to see a 30 yr old Dover close 5rm flat selling around 650K. For tat to happen, the valuation is at least 570-580K which is very high..in fact, for some of the record breaking deals in certain areas, the prices of old flats seems to be even higher than newer flats..one example is depot rd. the record breaking deal was 628K for a 34 yr old flat there whereas the newer ones in other blocks within the same area which is less than 10 yrs old is selling around 560-580K or so..

Well owners can ask for whatever they want.  End of the day is that the buyers agree on the price and the owners are willing to sign on the dotted lines.
 
There is no right or wrong in this case of asking x amount above value. As Owners always wants to sell high and buyers always want to buy low.  If you find the price not right, give it a pass.
 
The upfront cash for private is lower is because many of the times is bank loan can match the selling price.  HDB use to be under this system but HDB cancel away this "bank value" for reasons that most will know.

But previously can see the sizeable difference between the valuation of a new flat (less than 10yrs old) and valuation of a old flat (30yrs and abv) within the same estate, but now the difference gets very small and for some cases, the older one even selling at higher prices than the newer ones..
 
Take for example, I used to live in clementi..there were a few blocks of relatively new flat near the swimming pool where they used to sell abt 520-540K for 5rm in early 2007..the old flats (29 yrs and above) in clementi then (those in ave 2 and near ave 1) for 5rm were selling at about 400-420K..difference of abt 100K or slightly more..but fast forward to late 2007 and early 2009, the new ones some were selling at 600-620K, and now some of the old ones are selling 560-580k..the difference in price between old and new became very small..only difference of 20-40K compared to previous..

I understand where you are coming from and I totally agree with you. However, I would like to highlight that sometimes by looking at the resale transaction, we need to view it with a open mind as well.  The reason why I say that is because they might not reflect the "actual" selling price.
 
Anyway it is best to compare units sold at the same time and value done at the same time.  The reason is because 2 units same size, same facing, same deco, same height can have a diff in value of close to 20k as the valuation report was done only about 2 weeks apart.
 
Maybe sometimes got a "cxxk eye valuer? :)

But hor, when so much news came out of wat is sold at which level and etc, it creates false impression majority of singaporeans is cash rich and it is contagious in tat this optismism will get rubbed onto owners, even for those staying in JW, BP who all started to think their flat can be sold at 30-40K abv valuation..unfortunately, even for many young couples, a JW flat at 30K valuation is still out of reach for them..so its like LL no choice but to consider only low flr units?? this optimism may not have been realised if valuation had gone up at a more steady rather than at an accelerated pace..
 
That is an unfortunate fact of headline prices. But it cuts both ways, when the news is bad, the pressure is on the sellers.

Part of the reason I think is also becos old flats beginning to become popular again becos of size and layout compared to new ones..the couple that bought my 5rm flat (30yrs old) last yr said that they prefer our unit becos the newer ones is smaller and the layout of the flat is odd...and nowadays heard lots of pple lament tat new flats is getting smaller and missed the old days where flats was bigger..I guess pple are less mindful of age of property in recent times becos of this..

Yah bro... 
One common pattern i notice is... 
 
Agent: If u like the unit, must be fast...valuation is going up. U miss this... next month valuation will go up 10k cos transaction price rise...
 
Another pattern is...
 
Buyer: I like this unit. I don't mind paying $5k COV.
Agent: Owner asking $20k leh... last offer $12k... I can help u try $10k if u really interested.
 
WTF???!!! Thought got 12k offer liao...
 
Above are 2 real life encounter i myself had in the past week.

 
Please allow me to share my encounter with an agent last weekend. 
 
Was thinking of upgrading and trying to reduce the agent commission by letting her to sell my 4-room flat. As a seller, the default is 2% agent fee. I insist for a 1% percent commision fee for the agent since I am also buying from the same agent. Guess what was the agent reply?
 
Agent: OK, let me know how much COV you want. If you are selling for 330K, I will try to sell for 338K and I will keep the 8K!
 
 
My jaws drop when I hear this. Sometimes I really wonder how many black sheeps are there in the market and are they the ones who spoil the market?

Well those as you know are Bank Valuation. But if any owners were to spend some money and do a actual valuation, they might be shock to see the "actual" value.
 

What actually is an "actual" valuation?

This one possible lah, coz the 12k may be some time ago and has lapsed. 
 

Basically agent is focused on selling (then got comm) by hook or by crook. So they will only try to get the seller to accept lower price, while persuading higher from buyer to meet somewhere in the middle lor.

actually the trend is moving towards smaller flats but there are definitely people who are looking for bigger ones because they need to stay with in-laws and so on.
 
Thesedays, most of the condos are building more 2-bedrooms than 3 bedrooms. 5 years ago, it was all mainly 3 bedrooms and they realise very difficult to sell.

Actual value is done by a actual valuer. they need to go down to the unit and inspect.  FOr private the value report alone might set the owner back at least close to $1500 thus no one will be keen to do such value since now bank can match.

My friend just bought a condo in CCK for 570k. 
It is cheaper than alot of 5room flat in 'Premium' location...
 
Can't understand why there are ppl who pay half a million or more for a HDB flat. 

 
bro, your friend condo is 99yrs or freehold?

Can't imagine a 10+ year old, 5 room falt in jurong east to be around 500K  
Right now, a brand new, freehold, 2 bedroom condo, 500 meters from dhoby ghaut is only $950K. 
 
I think there is some serious price disparity. Clearly fom the price of prime district condos vs HDB flats in suburb areas, I can see a major correction is heading our way.

 
i juz bought 15yr old 4 room flat at jurong east b105 for 302k.  5 room really not worth the price to pay, neither is executive.
 
as for the 950k condo, that double of 500k.  not everyone can afford housing >500k so im thinking probably hdb will remain strong at 300-500k range, else how can the majority of sinkies afford housing?

condo got overhead like mtce, sinking fund and property tax.  pay a bit more for something nice but loan interest can be a killer if not careful, esp if for permanent staying cos that goes into ur cost of staying.

Actually buying smaller flat is very short sighted, as your family grows you will find that it is not enough space.
 
Public should always realise this rather than go short sighted way and in the end spend more when coming to upgrade.

It is rather harsh to say that buying a smaller flat is short sighted. It boils down to individual choice and circumstances at the end of the day. 
 
How many people stayed their entire life in the same flat from birth till death? I think hardly nowsday, especially the younger folks.

Not from birth to death but from marriage to death, many, depends on which estate. Look at Kreta Ayer, Spottiswoode park, Alexander, Queenstown, and almost all centrally located HDBs and landed homes. 
 
So make the right choice, it would become a lifelong choice if you make the right one. But if you don't, then of course you will find yourself shifting ever so often.

A colleague of mine was eyeing this unit in pasir ris.Owner wanted 30k cov,but my colleague budget is 25k or less only. seller agent told my colleague if he manage to reduce the seller cov to 22k. the excess 3k under table give to seller agent.
 
My colleague say ok and the agent managed to reduce cov to 22k and he pocketed the 3k from my friend. Reason was coz the seller paying agent 1% only,agent not happy.
 
WTF..i told my colleague you should have told the seller & complained to the company.

Not true.. you need to take all transaction as a buz transaction.  In actual fact, it is a win deal for your friend as he bought it at a lower price by buying the seller's agent heart over.
 
If you friend do not want to fork out this amount this can be close to no deal at all.
 
Sometimes i pity those agents that find means and way to help their buyer get lower prices they are most often the party to be the "black sheep".  
 
I once advice my friend to go direct and pay the seller's agent for a landed property 1% comm to buy him over.  In the end, he got it at a dead good price.  So in the end you find the agent that took the comm a black sheep or my friend got a good deal?  Which is more important?

Punggol not that bad lah, with the venetian style development due to transform the estate in a few years time. Those who bought their flats earlier can consider themselves quite lucky liao. Think prices are going to climb as the facilities are in operation.

Hahaha. I hv a few frens who bought flats there. All damm regret. Some don't even want to stay there. Just leave the house empty.

Valuation is based on past prices of similar location, block and floor.   
The choice is (always) with the buyer. If the buyer insists to vie those choice units with others who are richer, then why complain the valuation is "unfair", no one forces you to buy leh. 
 
 If buyer goes for 2nd floor & ulu location unit, i'm sure no en-bloc buyers will buy  and one won't be affected by the so-called unfair valuation lor.

 
If i not wrong valuation also take into the a/c of future development of the area.

I can only say the seller is dumb. 
 

That's when i was selling my unit, i never sign exclusive with any 1 agent as i do not have any 100% trusted one. I just tell all agents that i will pay 1% comm when the deal is closed through whoever brings the (successful) buyer over. I am willing to pay for result, not half-past-6 effort.
 

10% of them ask me if they close higher than my initial asking price can give >1% comm, i just retort back by asking them to put an offer on the table first, no offer why bother. 
 

In the end, quite a handful advertised for me and i have like 20+ viewings over 3 weekends, and about 5 offers (buyers from different agents), before hitting my reserve price.

Just to share with you on my case
 
bgt a 3 room 39 yr old flat at bt ho swee in early 2007 for 170k at valuation and just sold it for 285k with valuation at 245K....thats 75k increased in valuation in slightly more than 1 yr and still got pple want to buy....lucky me...actually wanted to stay but cant resist the $$$.....
 
guess if you are a buyer, with the valuation slightly on the high sight, the COV will be lower if not if the valuation is lower then you have to top up more cash
 
in the end, the flat sell at say 250k and its either more cash with valuation low of low cash with valuation high
 
but still....its our $$$ (money)

My friend just bought a condo in CCK for 570k. 
It is cheaper than alot of 5room flat in 'Premium' location...
 
Can't understand why there are ppl who pay half a million or more for a HDB flat. 

 
bro, your friend condo is 99yrs or freehold?
 
Should be 99yrs la....
 
Freehold where got so cheap??? 
 
But even at 99 yrs, 570K is even cheaper than 5 room in Bt Merah, Clementi, kim tian....etc. 
 
For ppl who drive, it is not a problem at all when it comes to location.
 
I will choose a condo ahead of HDB (prime location) anytime if price is same or lower..

In my view, the biggest earner is HDB. Land are probably bought as low as S$1 (due to resettlement) and after they build it they charged a couple of hundred thousands...and we all called it affordable housing.
