i dunno the pricing, but just wanted to share that I regretted doing parquet for my rooms as over time, they start to get scratches and dents if you drop things. Easy to say can redo. but with so many things put in after so many years, it's too troublesome and you'll probably have to live with it. A nice scratch/dent-resistant laminate would be a better choice.

heard about the cost and efforts required for maintenance too.. I have laminate flooring for my bed rooms in my current flat..It's almost 10 years and it still looks good. Only thing is laminate flooring feels hollow, and does not have the solid feel of parquet..which my wife dont like..

Parquet flooring should cost around 1500-2000$ for 3 bedroom from what I remember.

Havent seen anyone do parquet in living room. Would look a bit odd for my taste.

Dont do parquet. 
 

My whole house flooring is parquet. Except the kitchen. Makes the house look darker.
 

And like many have said, the scratches and dents is a sore to see. 
 

And it can only get more & more. Cos my kids keeps dropping things.  
 

Luckily mine is in small pieces, so far no wrapping after 10 years.

I agree. All my rooms are parquet. Although good to protect from cold floors they are still prone to damage. If I am given the chance again, I'll do up laminate. Does have its drawbacks but I prefer something more resistance to scratches.

wrong...it is more expensive, same for the doors
 

and to make it worse, you need to pay interest becos it add to cost price of the flat.
 

but some couples may not have enough cash, so they may take the HDB flooring & doors

Woah.. thanks guys for the great advices. Really gave me some insights on what I should choose.  
 

BTO OCS (4 room) :
 

a) $5000 for flooring(homogenous tiles) (living/dining room and 3 bedrooms)
 

b) $3790 for internal doors and sanitary fittings (wash basin, water tap and shower mixer)
 

Thus was thinking if I were to do the flooring my own, no point taking up the OCS. For b), totally out, not going to take..fugly and grossly overpriced..
 

Initial plan was to have a "zen theme" whereby the whole house will have this woody relax environment... but then after much discussion.. taking into consideration what's discussed here..we came up with this : 
 

take a) but overlay the bedrooms with laminate flooring (will try to find the flooring bro Jman888 mentioned). I reckon the cost for this should be ard 3-4k range.
 

What do you guys think?

actually it depends on how you look at it la.. the flooring can be paid using CPF.. I dont consider CPF as "my money" so if can use better use.. it will be a good 30+ years before I can smell it(provided the government don't further push the withdrawal limit...which is highly possible) 
 

More importantly is if you like the design or not..

I went to expo home exhibition after learning from bro mentioned here, there are 4-5 company selling laminated flooring, price differ. I spend some time talking and experiencing the 'feel' and sound, found one which is slightly ex by 20% compare with the rest, absorb sound better and half the thickness.
 

I am also sourcing for my house (3 bedroom + living), if you are doing only 3 bedroom,  should be within your budget (for the better quality one).
 

pm me if you are interested or go down and explore, i was there also to find out about wallpaper and windows, exhibition end this weekend.

I was contemplating between laminate and parquet last year when I was moving to a new place. I decided to choose laminate in the end as it's easier to maintain and much cheaper. I am using Supreme AC3 laminate. Can't remember the pricing liao..... The other thing nobody has mentioned yet is that when you do laminate, skirting comes at no extra charge whereas for parquet, you will need to pay for it. The bigger size per-piece is, the more expensive it is. The other thing is the amount of time needed to install. If I'm not mistaken, from beginning to the end, it will take about 1 1/2 weeks to install. Laminate will be just in a day or 2 max.

Yup.... On top of that, as we were buying resale, the existing flooring is marble which was not maintained at all. To knock off all the marble will cost a bomb also.

Besides the $$, i heard of horrible HDB workmanship.......... titles popping out, the titles grooves are not even.

Laminates has its own set of problem and I do agree it makes maintenace hassle free...jus got to take extra care...I wont encourage the whole house if u hv kid/s. room is good enuff but must set some house rules for the kids... do check the joint to make sure they are ok...i installed mine n end up some w joint issues and they hv to come back to settle those...if it is immediately spotted good...if u waited for 1 yr....u will see the difference as overtime the wood will bloat a little....
 

Laminates are less boring compared with Parquet and u can play around with different theme w different design n colors...Parquet...I tot it was either lighter or darker n yes scratches can be quite unsightly.... 
 

Whatever market says water resistant, do note it is resist not proof..so if u didnt clean away the water...gone liao...ask the company come over...another few hundred bucks to get it replace..
 

u may look at berry floor laminate...they hv quite a number of choices...avoid those china made bah...

U can choose HERF/vinyl flooring. Better than laminate. Water resistant as well. Same concept.

Only concern would be the issue that it's plastic.
 

Your OCS so expensive?

My OCS is the crappy tiles for whole flat + doors. 4.2 - 4.5 k.

thats why i so concern now...going to make decision soon... so don't want regret later after collection..
 

at that pricing rough estimate will be ard 3k for 3 bedrooms bah..even if overlay whole house (exclude kitchen & service bay) should not be more then 5K(still cheaper then my OCS option)... i think still quite acceptable if it performs as promised.

ok if it can last 20-50 years, good thing is it is easy to install and recycle, when you move house can take it along. So better to choose a classic pattern that can last looking at it for 50 years   [laugh]

unless u have enough CPF in your OA to paid the house and monthly installment fully without topping up with cash...else u are still paying the floor/door with your own cash...of cos divided by 30 years + interest is not a lot of $$...but i will rather use the cash to get something i like and more value for $$
 

for my BTO, if i opt for flooring, it will be tiles which is rather slippery when wet

your wife not working? If 2 person shouldn't have problem paying..
 

my current flat is only me paying as during the time of purchase my wife not working.. so i pay everything. But for this new bto, probably will get my wife to share abit of the loan..

Melody Zaccheus 

The Straits Times 

Monday, Oct 29, 2012

The Housing Board has introduced a doors-and-sanitary fittings package for Build-To-Order (BTO) flats launched from September.
 

The package costs between $3,190 and $4,330, depending on the flat type.
 

Home owners say this scheme goes some way to address concerns about the cost of the HDB's doors-only package, which costs about $3,000 on average for four- and five-room flats.
 

Under HDB's Optional Component Scheme (OCS), buyers can opt to pay for extra finishes such as flooring and internal doors.
 

They pick their options when selecting their flat at HDB Hub, and can use their Central Provident Fund or mortgage loan for this.
 

The OCS includes an internal doors package that ranges from $600 to $3,080, depending on how big the flat is.
 

A set of five laminated semi-solid timber doors, for instance, costs $2,830 for BTO projects launched in March this year such as Fajar Hills and Clementi Ridges. At Punggol Opal, a project launched in July, the set costs $3,080.
 

This works out to $566 to $616 per door for four- and five-room flats.
 

However, suppliers say that similar quality doors can be got for about $230 each, including installation.
 

Best Industrial in Kaki Bukit Crescent, a specialist in timber doors, charges $230 for a laminated semi-solid door with a timber frame. A full timber door - solid with no coat - costs $200.
 

This package, which includes installation, works out to $1,150 for home owners, including HDB home buyers.
 

Yong Fang Doors in Upper Bukit Timah Road sells and installs timber doors at $330 each. UHome Interior Design in Upper Paya Lebar Road charges a similar rate and its doors come with a 15-month warranty.
 

Last month, the HDB offered a new package offering doors and sanitary fittings including wash basins, taps and shower mixers costing between $3,190 and $4,330.
 

Sanitary fittings have never featured in the OCS before.
 

An HDB spokesman said sanitary fittings were introduced to provide greater flexibility and to minimise wastage when buyers choose to customise their own fittings during renovation.
 

The market rate for taps ranges from $20 to $300. Sinks cost between $40 and $300 and shower mixers start below $100 and can go up to $500.
 

Some home buyers, like Miss L. P. Lim, 37, who is unemployed, said the doors-plus-sanitary-fittings deal makes the package more attractive.
 

She added that she was generally pleased with what HDB has on offer. "One is really paying for convenience. You don't have to worry about the basics because those are taken care of and it's hassle free for owners. All in all it works out to be quite a good deal."
 

An HDB spokesman said the doors are sourced from suppliers and it requires its suppliers to ensure good workmanship and finishes. The agency sets out detailed specifications for the installation, ironmongery and locksets of its doors. Its doors also go through a series of tests to ensure their durability.
 

"Installation works are carried out by professional contractors and supervised by a team of consultants. HDB also provides a one-year Defects Liability Period, during which all defective items, if any, will be rectified," he said.
 

He added: "As these standards are good practices and not regulations, it is likely the doors supplied by renovation contractors may not meet similar standards."
 

Mr Poh Chin Tiong, 54, the boss of Best Industrial in Kaki Bukit, said HDB owners typically buy doors that cost around $200 each.
 

"The doors installed at such a price add value to the house. But those on a tighter budget can opt for cheaper doors such as classic doors with hollow cores that we sell for about $100," he said.
 

Driving instructor Muhammad Suhaimi, 29, who bought a four-room flat in Yishun last year, said he is perplexed by the price disparity, a view echoed by most home owners The Straits Times spoke to.
 

"Why are private contractor rates cheaper? HDB is buying and installing in bulk. It doesn't make sense to me," said Mr Muhammad.
 

Ms Ivy Tang, 31, an executive in the container industry, said that HDB should flag and explain to home buyers the pros and cons of opting in or out of the doors scheme.
 

"HDB should pre-empt buyers who might opt in out of convenience, to do their own research and calculations, be it for flooring, doors or sanitary fittings," she said.
 

The HDB spokesman said optional components are generally popular among home buyers.
 

About 70 per cent of those who selected a flat in this year's January and March BTO sales exercises, for instance, opted for at least one item under the scheme - for either doors or flooring, or both.
 

He said: "Many buyers continue to select them as they do not then have to engage their own contractors to do the works later on."
 

Others such as Mr Musbah Hashim, 52, who is unemployed, said they have little choice but to opt in.
 

He bought a four-room flat in Choa Chu Kang two weeks ago. "We cannot pay private contractors cash up front, so we have to to opt in as the money can be deducted from our CPF," he said.
 

Self-sourced doors differ from what HDB has to offer, said Mr Toh Chee Boon, 40, the deputy director of China Construction, which is handling four HDB projects.
 

"HDB doors are firmer internally and more durable. Stringent checks are also in place to ensure that the doors installed are of good quality," he said.
 

Ultimately, consumers have a right to exercise their choice, said Mr Seah Seng Choon, the executive director of the Consumers Association of Singapore.
 

"Buyers need to determine if they are comparing apple to apple. If quality seems the same, they can always get their own private contractors at lower cost."

Lots of different quality and thicknesses of laminate.
 

Make sure you look around and do your homework if you go for it.
 

Engineered wood also an options.
 

I suppose if you've got kids then proper wood might not be to your liking.
 

We really like solid wood.

Bro, I can understand why you might want to change the parquet into laminated likely due to scratches, dents etc which wood is particularly prone to.
 
But I don't quite understand why you want to lay laminate over your marble??
Only draw back of marble I can think of is that it becomes dull if you had not polished it for long time
but think can live with it right?

I think no need but some feedback about laminated flooring is that it might have air bubbles below
after several years cos is glue based and due to our humid weather (but this hearsay only so can't confirm)
 
The other thing I understand is that when you walk on laminated is like bouncy feeling. This one I personally have felt when I visited some show flats with laminated flooring. Different from the solid feeling of parquet. But this subjective cos when i said this, some people say no.

just lay over the existing floor. You lost 1cm only.
The cost of hacking could ended up more than the laminated floor.
 
But marble floor... step on it... solid feel.
Laminated floor... can feel the air gap below. No siok. But good for family with new toddler learning to walk though. fall down less pain.

You are absolutely right!
 
Then, they will tell you their product is donno how many mm thick. You won't feel the bubble... bla... bla... but not true. Yes, thicker feels better. But still far from solid wood.

Only concern is you may have to trim all the door that you lay on to accommodate the raise floor, so if you take away the laminated floor, the gap of the floor to door will be quite ugly.

some points to share on laminate floor:
 
advantages:
1. no need to remove the existing floor finish by way of overlaying it, but still need to remove the existing skirting otherwise you can have very thick skirting which consists of old floor material and your new laminate skirting
2. takes a day or two to do it 
3. cheaper option (of course there are few 'branded' one which may cost much more)
4. have better scratch/dent proof property compared to parquet
5. plenty of color and pattern to choose
 
disadvantages:
1. hollow sound as it is laid on top of existing floor finish with only Styrofoam sheet as the base, using tongue and groove method, no glue whatsoever, though there is underlay sheet to slightly reduce (not eliminate) the hollow sound as an option. (only skirting area installation need to use glue)
2. relatively prone to water seepage on the joint line between two planks, so need to ensure mope/wipe off dry any liquid spillage immediately.
3. need to trim all door leaves
4. trimming on every door opening to allow the expansion of this material (high density fiber board), so you won't have a complete flat surface to your entire flooring level

You only concern with the flooring material cost? Usually a flooring material that is softer and faster waering protects our legs much better (better for our health).
I believe our health to be worth more than the flooring material cost.
Between parquet and laminates, laminates a little harder than parquet.

Vinyl is basically plastic, that's why it is water resistent. The lower grade one may have plastic smell. Roll is one piece that you stick to the floor. Cheap. The higher end one have the click system like wooden laminates.

once the vinyl becomes brittle and start to flake out, it's a nightmare.
 
Flooring should always be in wood or earth element to reduce static build up.

This is based on true experience.  I am glad i have laminates as they are less solid thus not so painful when kids fall on them, helps to cushion the impact a bit more. My baby had fell from the bed before. I can't imagine if they had fallen on tiles or parquet, it would be much more painful.

parquet is only nice if you are able to maintain the finishing and take extra care to avoid dents or scratches,
....dents, scratches and even air-con drips leaves a stained eye-sore over time.
 
as far as I know, parquet is also not all that waterproof....spillages do seep between the joints and is sucked into the woods from under,....best to try and quickly wipe the spill.
 
the worst thing about parquet is that they succumb to termites, I speak from experience while my previous home got hit,  big time ! 
 
I now worry all the time since my current home came with also parquet floorings,...not by my choice if I may add.
 
where I work, floors are wood-look-alike,....not sure if vinyl or laminates, 
,.....but looks damn good, cheaper, easy to maintain, re-floored every 5 to 6 years for a fresh look with the work completed in a day, max 2 and the choices of wood types to match are almost endless.
 
however you will need a good, experience installer to ensure joints and ends are done correctly, failing which you may see it popping over some time.......it would be good to also finish the ends with some skirting.

This is based on true experience. I am glad i have laminates as they are less solid thus not so painful when kids fall on them, helps to cushion the impact a bit more. My baby had fell from the bed before. I can't imagine if they had fallen on tiles or parquet, it would be much more painful.
 
I would suggest getting a thick pile rug
 
in case the baby falls on the floor.
 
I fell down and hit my head when I was a baby
 
and my mum I was never the same after that.

Whichever you decide upon make sure the underfloor mortar screed is very very level.
If not, parquet will move up and down and laminate will sound hollow.
When I was in UK I layed four rooms of laminate flooring in my house.
Not a DIY er but it was very easy and satisfying and it was fine for the 10 years plus we were there.
First room I did was the bathroom and I used a very cheap laminate, got it in a sale and it wasn't supposed to be suitable for bathrooms or where you get water spillage.
The next three rooms I used a top of the range waterproof laminate.
 
When we left the house guess which laminate still looked the best.
 
When we were sourcing flooring for our new HDB 4 years ago we looked at laminate but eventually decided upom parquet for two rooms.  But the flexible laminate would be perfect for an uneven level floored bathroom I think and it does look good.
 
In UK parquet is much more expensive than laminate but in Singapore iirc there is not much diff in price.
