I really love this gov day by day. 

Their CPF restoration implementation is really spot on to win my heart in voting and having 101% confidence in this gov!
 

When property is expensive, people maxed out the CPF to repayment. Some still need to top up.
 

Many people complain and this gov does listen to our issues!
 

If there is higher CPF contributions = more salary = more can buy bigger and more expensive properties using CPF.
 

YEAH!

they can restore CPF back to 40% , 60% 80%  whatever.. HDB will suck it all back
 

HDB affordability will then be base on the contribution of 40% , 60% 80% contribution rate

Not if you've already bought a property... 
 

Anyway, it's high time that the employer's portion of the CPF be restored back to the 'normal' 20% level. If we wait longer, next recession will be on us... then the same excuses will be rolled out, and delay again

Get a bigger house? More like a bigger cage, to lock you you down.
 

Not to forget, there's a minimum sum to maintain and it is ever-growing...you may even need to pledge your property if you don't have enough
 

CPF Minimum Sum
 

Termasuck makes 16% return on investments and how much interest did we get in our CPF? 2.5%
 

I wonder where did the rest go to?

most of us here already hit the monthly ceiling.  in any case even if the increase is a few hundred dollars, it's not going to change the fact that real inflation is probably double digit in singapore for the majority.  so this increase of CPF if any, can hardly ease the woes of the low income.
 

as for property,  i am of the opinion that new regulations on property transactions will be announced soon.

as to how great the impact will be, it depends on the new regulations.

but anyone who continues to bite more than he can chew, will in the end, choke.  

there is simply no two ways about this law of nature.

higher CPF contributions= additonal $41 into my OA account and $26 into my special account.
 

You mean the additional $41  in OA can allow me to buy a bigger and more expensive properties??? 
 

And the additonal of $67.5 can let you have 101% confidence in this gov??? 
 

Something very wrong with you leh 
 

Then if with a pay increment of just $100 you can upgrade to a bigger and more expensive car already.

I thought Govt is trying to educate or discourage us from using too much CPF to buy property? Once retired, no CPF money how? sell house, downgrade or get sons/daughters to continue to service loans?

Not only me with such thinking hor.
 

But I believe many cars owners have the same concept of 'affording' a bigger and better car, just because for an additional $67.5 extra monthly installment can allow them to drive a 1.8 instead of a 1.6.

Or a Koup, instead of a Forte, or in my case a BMW320 instead of SSS.
 

$67.5 may not be much to some of you who suck cigars like sucking pepsi.
 

But to the majority of HDB upgrader, it means less $67.5 in upfront cash top-up for their monthly housing loan.
 

The savings can be put to a bigger car, nice restaurant meals, new HP, or for my case.....an extra cigars or 6 packets of cigrettes to smoke!!

Higher CPF can also mean same amt of salary, lower taking home amount.
 

It can also mean, retrenchment for many companies are not able to carry that percentage for all their employees. Then, it will come down to same pay, more work per employee. 
 

Let's not just look on the good side. Economy is not as good as the Government has painted.

i sincerely believe that Singapore economy is improving but not ppl here. 

Not because FT or Singaporean matter.  It is because economy better because of more jobs offer.  But the pay of the jobs are not better (not the minister of course).  That is why a lot of working ppl here KPKB. Their pay is never really increase. Just that there are more sub 2K jobs available, everything started to increase.

What perspective.???
 

TS said, with the increment can buy bigger and more expensive house... Yea, assuming that it's 1.5% increment and ALL of it goes into OA then there's an increment of 67.5 bucks to play with. That kind of money can definitely ease some monthly loan repayment but seriously, you believe it can make you buy a bigger and better house?

The citizens still doesn't get to benefit from this as its part of a funny money that we can see figures but won't actually do us any good other than paying for our pigeon holes. Ultimately its more money for the gov to do their bidding be it investing or upgrading infrastructure even if they claim that the money belongs to the general public.

Ppl in those days can really accumulate a lot of CPF monies.
 

More CPF contributions, higher cap, more interest earned plus cheaper housing.
 

Ppl in the late 40's and 50's will know.
 

Hell a lot of diff.



 
 

fully agree..... those btw 35-45 today    and those in 25-35   [sweatdrop]  and  i dare not imagine what will happen to those below 25....

8%? Next jump already said to be 10%. And to think HK scrapped the plans to introduce GST after the people protested, while at the same time our GST increased from 5% to 7%.

The way i see things take their course, in the not too distant future, there will be very very clear distinction between the rich and poor.

in other words the gap will pull apart instead of closing.
 

It's the same for every country that opens up to globalisation.

And the smaller the country the quicker and wider this rich poor gap will become.

and Singapore is very small.  
 

For big backward countries which open up to globalisation, they will benefit.

for Singapore, (as a developed country) if we follow blindly without the right controls in place, my believe is that the average Singaporean will definitely be marginalised.  
 

I'm not a politician nor rocket scientist nor academic professor and I have no agenda.

I am just an average Singaporean, born and bred.

Never let it be said that our gahmen is stupid and our ministers don't deserve their pay package. After this they deserve an increase of 1% pay raise too    Even taking the lowest pay of $1m, 1% is 10,000 frigging dollars to you and me OK

Just ask my collegue now 48 yrs old.
 

During his time, CPF contribution was 25%/25% !!!!!
 

Can you imagine your CPF accumulating at the rate of 50% of your salary. And at a higher cap than the current 4.5k.
 

TS see 1% increase happy like fark.   Really frog in the well.  
 
 




Yup... In those days, when they retire, really lui pa pa.... Gahmen see liao red eyes, so now they squeeze our LP harder so that we are more obedient and work till even more older age...

Some what right, don't recall the exact amount. More like a $1000 peak on contribution. But you'd still get something for your bonuses etc.
 




there is a ceiling for employer contribution.... if i am not wrong, after $4.5k employer no need to contribute liao...

therefore, no difference for those >$4.5/mth...

Cannot compare lah, in yesterday, everyone lived on passion, cost of fund management is manageable. The global economy was on a wild and sustained upswing. Today, we need to pay top dollar to attract the right ppl to manage our CPF money. 
 

Damn, why am I not one of those right ppl
