Looking around for 3 room condo/e-condo below 480k.. preferably in the east. Some which i know are Simei Green, Pinevale, Eastpoint Green, Aquarius by the Park.. Also The Rivervale in the northeast. 
 
- 480k or below for a 3 room condo/e-condo reasonable right? or isit too low?
- Which other areas are around this price? 
- Anyone knows of any good deals or know of anyone selling?

Bro
 
Just out of curiosity, how old are these condos (i.e. the ones you mentioned) and are they all old ECs? 480K for a new 2BR condo is a stretch already so i'm surprised that u can get a 3BR condo or 3+! at 480K.

Wow...nowadays 99 year condo's are only around 50-100K more than a similar sized HDB in the same location.
 
Bro...ur $180 monthly maintainence is really cheap! HDB MSCP season parking alone alrdy charges $90 for 1 carpark liao  add in the monthly conservancy fee of about 60-80 bucks...is almsot the same as your alrdy.

Bros, do be careful when it comes to maintenance and sinking funds.. Don't just go for cheap. You do have to look out on the status of the condo's maintenance and sinking funds...
 
Most capital expenditures comes when the estate is about 7 years old... so if the sinking fund is insufficient to cater for the big repair jobs... end up having to pay levies...

I think you should find a 99 year unit under 480k very easily. If you don't mind low floors, they are going for as low as 360k.

$395K... that is quite low for Bedok reservoir area. The one u sold, is it a choice unit, meaning, good facing, reservior view, high floor etc...Wonder still able to get this price nowadays at Aquarius?

Bro,
 
Simei Green still have, think should be below your budget of 480k.
Nice estate, pretty quiet, just that carpark is not the basement type. If u park in the multi storey carpark,there is no sheltered walkway (only to one of the blocks). Other than that, i am happy with the place

Saw from URA website and condo.com.sg that THE LINEAR is about 550 to 650 psf.
 
Seems cheap but review from the public is rather unfavorable. From the pictures, it doesnt look all that bad. Hmmm...can consider?

Ya, Parc Oasis closes to $580 psf, dun know is it too ex? knowing that Only less than 10 months ago, the condo here only sold less than $500 psf, thinking of that, really hard to pay this kind of price. Somemore uncertainties like property mkt whether heading down or boom? These really bothering me....
 
Anyone know any good condos near MRT in the east side as well?
 
Thanks.....

Bro. i got a stupid question here...
 
if we buy a second hand condo, how many percent will be the min upfront cash and as for the loan, we have to pay cash instead of CPF right.

Check with Agent better, they will explin better. It depends on whether sold by developers or not. But normally its 5% cash, 15% cash/CPF. If use CPF, take note of the min CPF Housing withdrawal Limit.
