Want cheap want good  
 

There's no such a thing like cheap and cheerful; there's cheap and nasty and there's expensive and cheerful.

You did the most work lah... You supervise and delegate - and alot of brain work on strategic painting and help create a procedure to reduce and minimise the number of painting strokes but maximise painted surface area and to ensure that no paint wasted, you calculated the amount of paint / stroke to derived the minimum cans of paint thereby help reduce overall cost and increase the efficiency and instead of 40 manhours you achieve it in 20.
 

Phew... that is alot of work !

Nippon paint has the widest range of paint color and effect.
 
In terms of painting cost, most painters offer about the same pricing so it doesn't really matter that much.

unwanted stain on door window frames even ceiling fans and lightings,
-basically "paint quickly n go" job received. 
 
paint is already much more cheaper than wallpaper if u put it another way

Same sentiments here.
 
Cheaper by few hundreds but the aftermath is white patches appeared everywhere. Suspect is diluted with too much water and paint is thin.
 
Now I buy paint myself and ask bangla to paint.

my colleague move into her new condo. Mention going to keep everything as it is. Not going to paint the wall till two years later.
 
Is that like a reasonable expectation that what ever came with it is sufficient. Or like some contractor mention. It's a martex paint and u need to give it a coat ( and me business)
