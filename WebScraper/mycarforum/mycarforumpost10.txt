Agree price, then get valuation for HDB resale deals
Published on Mar 10, 2014 

By Janice Heng
 
Cash-over-valuation (COV) figures will no longer be part of the negotiating process for Housing Board resale deals, as buyers and sellers will now have to agree upon a price first before getting an official valuation, National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan said in Parliament on Monday.
 
Previously, sellers usually got valuations first, and then negotiated with buyers over how much more - or less - should be paid. But negotiations should "rightly" be based on recent transaction prices, not the additional cash premium or COV, said Mr Khaw.
 
So from 5 pm on Monday, a price must first be agreed upon and the Option to Purchase (OTP) granted, before buyers can request a valuation from the HDB. HDB will no longer give valuations to sellers, although existing OTPs and valuations will still be honoured until their expiry.
 
This move will "restore the original intention of valuation, which is to help buyers get a housing loan," said Mr Khaw.
 

 

 
workable?

Seems backwards to me - unless there is something I am missing? 
 
Can still get valuation from private valuer or not?  Then "official" valuation from HDB? 
 
What will the bank loan be based on - private valuer or HDB? 
 
But yeah - seems to be inviting problems to me, what if the loan approval and the valuation don't "match"? 
 
And also - how can we agree on a price, if we don't know the value?  This is a house you are buying, not a pasir malam set of pyjamas where you can tikam tikam hoot price.

many a time the seller decide on the COV first before the valuation is out, hence they die die want $100K COV regardless. If without valuation you will only look at what you can afford. Better this way?

some buyers dun like COV will only look at the final price, if i think it worth $600K and that will be my final.

But you're mixing buyer and seller here. 
 
In any case - am I misunderstanding the system?  Why does COV matter to SELLER?  For him, shouldn't it be total price?  
 
Isn't that total price - whatever pay back to CPF, then balance to my pocket?  COV makes no difference to this right?  (or am I wrong?) 
 
On the other hand, for BUYER - the COV cannot be purchased - it must be the purple folding stuff regardless? So he would have a max COV he is comfortable with. 
So my question becomes - lets say we agree price of $550k, based on $500k value + $50k COV. 
But then valuation comes in at $480k - so now COV is $70k - 
 
Solly lah!! I not enough cash for $70k COV - So transaction falls through? How like that?

I feel that not enough thought has been put into this and it reeks of being a knee-jerk reactionary policy change.
 
There will a lot of operational problems popping up from this which will warrant further tweaking.
 
As a buyer, I would not commit to a property without knowing whether it is affordable. This includes the financing availability, cash payable, payment milestones, etc. Erring on the side of caution due to this factor means that my offer price would be very much lower than prevailing market pricing due to the down-trend.
 
As a seller, I would use the latest transaction amounts of similar properties in the vicinity as a benchmark for my expected sale price. In a down-trend, successive valuations would be decreasing over time. This widens the gap between buyer and seller expectations, resulting in a further reduction in transaction volume.
 
This will exacerbate the present down-trend for HDB prices because potential buyers will delay their purchases due to uncertainties in the above aspects (resulting in lowered demand), creating a vicious cycle in which both volumes and prices fall.

no need HDB intervention and prices will get depressed by market forces. if seller tries too many times to sell but all are unsuccessful, then he will be forced to relent and lower his price.

Yeah, definitely looks like a new measure to exert pressure to bring down resale prices further.  Buyers will have to factor in a bigger buffer when they make an offer, in case the valuation is lower than expected.  They will have to do their homework, be more cautious and likely offer lower prices just in case.
 
Prices will continue to soften.... until 2016 elections.
 
So sellers better sell now, and buyers better wait for lower prices!

Big question still relies on what the valuation dept of HDB will do - 
 
Is this transparent or is it murky? How predictable? 
 
If their instructions are to be conservative, then all die, if they hold the line on valuation then how?

The murkier the valuation, the more conservative the buyer will behave!
 
But I would guess each month the valuation will not vary from the previous month by more than 1-2% (which technically can add up to +- 10-20% per year).

Yes, the information will be available online on a weekly basis (instead of fortnightly as in the current practice). The problem is with the distortion of the otherwise logical processes that a typical purchase comprises.
 
Valuation in its very essence is to provide the buyer and seller an expert opinion of its market value. This is to facilitate the two (and all other related parties in the transaction e.g. financing institution) in various stages of the transaction: price negotiation, in-principle loan approval, etc which need to happen before agreement of purchase/sale price. 
 
By forcing the shift of valuation to after the establishment of purchase/sale price, it defeats (in a mocking manner) the purpose of valuation. It is no different from putting the cart before the horse.
 
 
I thought all information is in the hdb website on previous transacted price (no disclosure of cov amount)?

One unique thing about Singapore is that we often try not to call a spade a spade. Many believe this helps us avoid the embarrassment that tends to come with public recognition of decision mistakes and/or policy failures.
 
Our culture leads us to think that making mistakes is a big no-no and so renaming/repackaging the boo-boo or coming up with a big smoke-screen in hope of preventing mass recognition of the issue at-hand is perfectly acceptable.
 
Unfortunately the truth cannot be further from that. The reason is simple. Everyone recognises a spade when they see one.
 
Thus in the end, after much meandering and politicking, the parties involved have little choice but to admit that they have a spade to deal with. Much like the proverbial emperor who had to flee to his palace in his birthday suit.
 
All human beings make mistakes. Who is perfect? It is more important that mistakes are identified, admitted to and then quickly resolved.

just because agree selling price first before valuation means cov is not there? lol
 
soon seller and buyer and agent will come up with an agreement to rebate or top up if the agree price does not tally with the expected valuation
 
one step forward, two steps back ... why make thing so difficult???

It looks like there is a lot going to kill the prices of HDB.

Suddenly the game plan is to flood the market with BTOs when just 1 election ago, its asset enhancement,(frankly I wander whose asset they are trying to enhance ?)
 

If there are rules to tame the HDB COV, there should for all other housing.

And Please I'm not asking for increase duties, fees. Its time our govt start to think deeper, and not just use money in its policies.
 

It looks like suddenly the curbing methods for HDB just went non-monetary. Well, I'm surprised. Do that for the rest.

This new rule is not well thought tru it seems. In theory, hdb can crash/charge the whole housing mkt by valuing every HDB unit the price some "intellectual" top dog thinks so? This is not free mkt at all.. I can understand cooling measures.. But this measure reeks of some hidden plot... 
Phrase it this way, someone who wants to relocate to the same hdb area.. Can sell his place cheaply..hence forcing valuation of his own choice unit down rite?
 
This is insane...

agent will definitely equip themself with all kind of stats and transacted price (like they have not done enough)
 
sometime the valuation differ unti by unit due to condition, reno, layout, floor, etc
seller will try to sell their not so good unit benchmarking good unit ... lol

Agreed! Now the hdb valuers HAVE to see the physical units. Ascertain the condition of everything etc...
Owners can take oppty to be extra nice (monetary wise) to them to get the right valuation. I have no faith and place no faith in such a system

I personally is in view of not having a *3rd party* like HDB to provide any valuation. Just the pure buyer and seller in the mix, driven on its own.
 
The numbers in a *valuation* can be skewed to an artificial level to make people feel rich.

Private housing or HDB, the insane rise in prices do not make a country strong or rich, it only makes it expensive. and boy we sure know how to make that happen. so what next Singapore ? after houses and cars being the most expensive in the world, what is the next BIG thing to push up to make money ? 

One writer did mentioned that if everyone just go buy a 2nd property and rent it out for residual income, it does not make our countrymen better, it makes them lazy.

If one is to worry, I guess the price would reduced to last transacted price or slightly lower but Crash? 
I guess how desperate the owner is, it won't sell a $500k flat at $250k, even if there is one isolated case, other seller would rather hold on to their flat and not thinking of upgrading or moving.
 
Why people worried about price drop where 90% of the people kpkb that hdb is getting expensive and the younger generation can no longer afford?

Stupid system. Then again, points also can't change for fuel la, and that RadX still don't want to give me my parking coupons.
 
I wouldn't mind our "leaders" admitting that they did something wrong, and for the betterment of society, should change / reverse some policies. Everyone makes mistakes, those who can admit it and learn from it are people to follow, to emulate.
 
Yet, somehow, I find more of the self-made entrepreneurs admitting to their mistakes than our MIWs..
 
If something bad happens, we must reflect, and if we find that we're wrong, we should admit, learn and change our ways. Else, others will change and overtake us.

imo this is rather dumb. Whats wrong with the current system . At least Its transparent . Valuation is actually not by HDB. Its actually done by approved agencies. 
 
With this new rule, only complicate things. 
 
Home buyers must be responsible for their own offer. If they like the unit and can pay for it , by all means pay the 100k COV. 
 
Likewise, If the Seller is contented with the profit, he can accept at - 50k off the valuation . Its a free market. 
 
But now, they confuse people !!!  Imagine offering a price , SIGN A CONTRACT but deal may not go thru due loan complications. 
 
I am all for the TDSR and  cooling measures, taxes etc.. but this new rule is just stupid. Our ministers really no brain...

Um, that's a bit far fetched. If I sell my flat cheaply on purpose (-50k below market), how much do you think the unit I want to buy will be affected? Considering the market is affected by units other than mine, the answer is definitely less than 50k.
 
My main problem with this new system is that there is too much uncertainty over the loan amount a buyer will be eligible for. Yes, this is likely to push buyers' offers downwards but it is also unfair to genuine buyers who cannot fork out the COV after placing a deposit or exercising an option to purchase.

is HDB using LTA's COE strategy???
 
Buy Car n wait for COE valuation... 
Decide to pay $100k for car
Pay $5k deposit... 6 tries COE rebate @ $60K
wait for COE bidding.. dealer bid $62K
if COE $61K ok u get the car... 
If COE $70K, dealer call u to top up...
if COE $50K, u get back $9K...
 
So buy house nw same policy???
Buy house n decided that you want pay $500K...
If valuation come out $450K... buyer pay $50K cash (COV?)
if valuation come out $550K... seller luigi?

Buyer still have to base on the HLE and obtain a in principle loan approval from bank on the amount that he is comfortable with. If he only qualify for $500K loan but die die want to buy $800K loan? Doubt any bank would give him.

Another scholar idea really out of this world.
If buyer offer and seller agreed on 500k valuation turn out to be 400k like that buyer can no longer back out?
 
If buyer offer and seller agreed on 500k and valuation turns out to be 600k can the seller back out?
 
Now they throw the ball back to the buyer and seller.if buy or sell flat lugi don't blame hdb.
Or did I missed out anything?

Buyer still have to base on the HLE and obtain a in principle loan approval from bank on the amount that he is comfortable with. If he only qualify for $500K loan but die die want to buy $800K loan? Doubt any bank would give him.
 
HLE only gives you the maximum loan you can take.
 
For example: 500k HLE so you exercise an OTP for a flat for 500k. You estimate that the valuation will be 480k and you have enough cash for that.
 
Turns out the flat is only valued at 450k and you suddenly have to fork out an additional 30k cash you might not have.

Same as before, if you dun have cash would you go commit $100 cov since cov cannot pay by loan?
 
Base on the daily update transacted price (as mentioned under the new rule), you get a bench mark of what price the neighboring units were sold at, hence as a guide for the valuation and cov would be like.

Since the new rule effective immediately, meaning they use the past 2 quarters of low or zero cov as a benchmark of the valuation. The valuation will not be different by $100K (only cov will in the past) amongst the same model within the same neighboring estate.

a guide only ... the actual valuation is still upmost important
upstair vs downstair ... price already difference
imagine when you want to commit ... there was no downstair transacted price and the seller use upstair price with minus $2k-$3k, ai mai?
 
even left unit vs right unit price also difference ... 1 sibei laopok condition and 1 is above average condition
not sure whether valuer take into cosideration of near lift vs far from lift ... near rubbish chute ... facing MSCP ... unblock view .. this one sure take right , etc

Siao liao lor, I bought BTO for $350K which is cheaper than nearby re-sale price(for year 2013). 
 
When it complete at end 2016/early 2017, will this $350K become higher than nearby re-sale price?. 
 
If this become true, I think many people kena   by gahmen by thinking buy BTO is more "affordable".

Daily updated doesn't mean accurate as of today because by the time the OTP has been exercised and the formalities completed and informed to HDB, a month or two could have passed already.

this is a domino effect... the valuation will follow closely to last transaction. so last person will pull the next person down... unless u dont want see house. so this time agent dont need show valuation, he just show this last transaction price of this area from this APPs in mobile phone then can offer price. buyer sure be safer side, offer 20k and below off the value, using the excuse of scare the value dropped. but if there is a close transaction that a seller submit 3-5 days ahead with the price dropping alot then god bless the one that is behind and just submitted the OTP form. This is the trap to seller. those asking for COV can wait long long liao.

I think this way will prevent buyer from offering too high. Now some people with alot of cash don't mind to offer 100+K COV. With this now they have to be more careful just in case the valuation is lower than what they expected lo. Then the next person to buy will also offer lower after looking at the price of the previous transactions just in case.

If the valuation is $800k but they ask for $1 mil, one transaction in queens town with cov of $250k mah.
 
Again there is always some cash rich guy willing to pay, but if majority are more conscious, they would wait lor, then sell will hold lor. Isn't that the original intention of having a house and keep it?

Just like PTE prop, buyers can back out, sellers can't. This rule is to whack sellers who have been stubbon with the price using valuation to squeeze buyers. COV just touched 0 but it will take a long time for valuation to drop. I think this rule is meant to accelerate the drop in price, not volume. Watch my next post.

In event of a valuation mismatch buyers can opt out and just forfeit $1k downpayment, whereas sellers have to LPPL and take it as it's a fair deal even as with private properties. This is what the OTP was originally planned for, to protect buyers as they have the most to loose. The sellers are obliged to exercise SNP and if he fails to do so, the buyer may seek legal mediation (sue the seller). This question brings up the revelation that many ppl on this thread have had no experience in buying/selling properties. I've been through many transactions in my experience in property investments and I can tell you that the rules are meant to bring down the valuation, which was originally meant to hold prices, at a faster pace.Ask yourself why was valuation implemented, and for HDB who's in control? You might think that a private company is doing the valuation but after searching you would be shock to know that all valuations eventually come from or are approved by HDB. Yes, HDB has been holding up resale prices for so long as sellers can use this tool to influence their buyers which will result in stable prices accross the HDB segment. Why does HDB always falls or increases after PTD properties (PTE properties always take the lead)? This is because HDB is controlling the valuation and that acts as a pillar for sellers and affects the offers made by buyers.You might think that PTE properties have valuations too right? Yes but it's difference and assigned by the banks which explains why some banks give you a higher valuation while some lower. It's also illegally possible to bribe the valuator giving your home a higher valuation (ahem!).Now, let me come back to the new HDB rule:1. This will bring about faster devaluation because in a dropping market, the sellers have no clue how much their flats are valued at. The previous transaction could already be sold at under valuation (CUV) and if it's based on that, the seller having no clue whatsoever, would base his at the same or around the same. The buyer, knowing that it's a falling market, would base it lower. Hence, without a controlling valuation set by HDB, the buyer could be paying CUV on top of an already undervalued figure. All else equal, the revse could be true for a booming market but read my next point below.2. Now you might think that it might help boost the current market right? Wrong. Firstly, the market is in a decline. Secondly, even in a booming market, buyers will be able to back out in event that the valuation is much lower than his offer (COV offered is too high). The shroud around the valuation in this case should not accelerate an already booming market. Buyer makes offer, and back out (forfeit $1k) if valuation is too low. The COV will never be as exaggerated as CUV as in my first point above (#1). Now you see why I said this rule is meant to punish sellers and not buyers?Of course, there may eventually be rules to protect sellers as well in the future but definitely not now when all other CMs are still in place. This should be the last CM to go IMO.

Problem is, how do you guide the renovation factor of that house based on past transaction record? The transaction record will not tell you how all the previous houses were renovated.
 
In the past, valuation would have taken that renovation into account. Now is a guessing game.
 
In anycase, the guys who will be hit are the agents. They will have a tough time negotiating and even if they think the deal is sealed, there is always a chance either side will wanna back out because later valuation proves too high or too low. Or bank loan could not go through.....all these kind of time consuming issues for agent, banks, seller, and buyers.
 
Whoever who comes out with this idea is crazy. I hope they have a fair process for "backing out" because I think that's going to happen a lot.

Valuation dun really take renovation into consideration as much as the cov, valuation usually base on location and level, renovation at most add $10k if you do up like condo style, but the seller will ask for $50k if the buyer agree that it worth the cost for no renovation needed.

New format may scare resale flat buyers
Adrian Lim
MyPaper Tuesday, Mar 11, 2014
 
SINGAPORE - Resale procedures for Housing Board flats have been revised and this could make buyers more cautious and cool the market further, said experts.
 
Buyers and sellers will be encouraged to negotiate based on latest transaction prices, instead of focusing on the cash over valuation (COV), as is the practice now.
 
Only buyers can request a valuation from the HDB panel of valuers, and this can be done only after a resale price has been negotiated and an option to purchase (OTP) granted.
 
PropNex Realty's chief executive, Mr Mohamed Ismail, said allowing valuation only so late in the deal could expose HDB flat buyers to a "higher vulnerability of a greater cash outlay if there is any gap between the agreed price and the valuation price".
 
In other words, if the valuation falls short of the agreed price, the buyer would face the prospect of topping up with cash.
 
Currently, most sellers would get a valuation report at the outset, and use that as a base to negotiate the COV. The COV is the amount in cash that buyers have to pay on top of the market valuation of the resale flat.
 
Such a practice is an "anomaly" unique to HDB's resale market and a contrast to the private market, where negotiations are based on recent transactions, said Minister for National Development Khaw Boon Wan.
 
Adding that nearly 40 per cent of resale transactions last month were priced below valuation, Mr Khaw said now is a good time to make this move.
 
In tandem, HDB will also publish daily the prices of resale transactions as soon as they are registered, to provide the latest market information.
 
The revisions took effect at 5pm yesterday. The option period will be extended from 14 days to 21 days to give buyers more time.
 
Mr Ismail expects HDB resale prices to "further dip" as potential buyers behave cautiously.
 
The seller, on the other hand, loses the advantage of getting a "first look" at the valuation, said Mr Colin Tan, head of research and consultancy, Suntec Real Estate Consultants.
 
Mr Nicholas Mak, director of research and consultancy at SLP International, said that in the period where COV was high, both buyers and sellers would "adjust their expectations of future COVs upwards, which further reinforces the upward price spiral".
 
However, Mr Alan Cheong, director for research and consultancy at Savills Singapore, said "transacted prices already have a positive or negative COV built in" and he does not think the revised procedures are a big change. Prices would still overshoot in a bullish market and undershoot in a down market. "In the end, is it a left-hand drive car or a right-hand drive car?" Mr Cheong asked.

if new rules bring about lower prices and lower transactions,
 
then aren't we moving towards fulfilling the objective of HDB which is to 
 
have affordable roofs to live for the long term and not buy bto to fund upgrade to EC or PC 5 years later?
 
if a couple does well and want to upgrade to condo, do so by all means but don't push up HDB prices for the masses.

if more units are sold CUV, the valuation will slowly go downward and hopefully, Bishan/Queenstown would be selling at reasonable price.

hdb asset enhancement policy is wrong from the start
 
i don't think we should continue on this path
 
with very affordable homes for the masses
 
most should have enough for retirement if they are prudent
 
and not get stuck in being asset rich cash poor
 
no sympathies for those who are not financially responsible.  
 
They should grow up and face the consequences
 
and all these upgrading and upgrading to higher and higher price properties on leverage
 
we are just making the real estate agents, developers, govt, lawyers etc very rich

HDB valuation has always been the supporting pillar for HDB pricing. 30 yo HDB, original condition in some ulu location never mind, if HDB valuation says $400K, the place is worth around $400K. With this 'official' price tag removed, prices can fall.

This type of sort after area won't be affected much … They will just ask for a high price & wait … Mr "Robert Vegetable Head" will eventually turn up … They won't let go … But thats only my opinion …  

 
 
can't stop the rich from topping up extra for better location, but without escalating price buyer now will be more conscious as there is a risk if they think of flipping within 2.5 years.

Actually its like PTE Property … Only the Mass Market is affected by all these *Cock & Bull* measures … Those in Prime Areas seldom budge … But you are right about the *Flippers*, those who are not cash rich flipping will be affected … Those  who got money to hold, which I know for a fact a lot do, will not even give *Hoot* about these measures …

Pai seh, dont really understand on this new ruling? Now if i want to buy one 3 room resale flat, let's say in yishun. So before agreed on the flat price, i should go HDB obtain the OTP before the seller can get the valuation? When both seller and me agreed on the price of the flat example $330K, then seller can go HDB get valuation? If the valuation is $300K, what happen? Or if the valuation is $340K, what happen?

From what i understand.. that wldnt happen as valuation will only state lower (COV factored in) or match the agreed price

err.... any different even with valuation and yet you commit a high price/COV? 

Instead of quarterly transacted prices, HDB will now release daily transacted prices of flats to be available to the public.
 
So this will form the basis of your price negotiation

last time was fortnightly (not monthly), yes daily update will form the basis of what price your neighbor has sold his flat for  
again it depends on demand and supply.

singaporeans love to be spoonfed
 
take away the benchmark supposedly set by a neutral party, everyone becomes lost
 
but they don't realize the neutral party has its own agenda when setting that benchmark for you to negotiate
 
when we go to market to buy things, what benchmarks are there?
 
the rules are the same whether big ticket item or not.
 
sellers will always try to maximize profit.
 
offer what you can afford or want to pay for the item.  if not walk away.

ok ma, that's what the private property market has been doing all these while.
 
those buyers that are conservative would have search for indicative prices on ura web, propertyguru, trust agent advice and ask for verbal desktop valuation from bankers.
 
I don't see why hdb buyers cannot search for indicative prices on hdb web, propertyguru, trust their agent advice and ask for desktop valuation from bankers as well.
 
only the gungho buyers would pay much above the market prices but they exists both in hdb and private property market anyway.

u forgot to mention the party that is made the richest from the asset enahncement.. the landowner!
 
 

hdb asset enhancement policy is wrong from the start
 
i don't think we should continue on this path
 
with very affordable homes for the masses
 
most should have enough for retirement if they are prudent
 
and not get stuck in being asset rich cash poor
 
no sympathies for those who are not financially responsible.  
 
They should grow up and face the consequences
 
and all these upgrading and upgrading to higher and higher price properties on leverage
 
we are just making the real estate agents, developers, govt, lawyers etc very rich

why not, first you have the HLE and bank approval of what you can afford. Base on the transaction history you can determine what kind of COV that it may cost (or the cash you have in the bank).  If the valuation is too far off and COV become what you dun have, then no go lor.
 
Just like previous many sellers have not even obtain the valuation report but tell you upfront they want $100K on top of valuation, any different?

To me, HDB flat should not be an asset in the very first place, the Original Objective of Gov setting up HDB is to providing Every family with affordable a home(居者有其屋)
HDB should be the one fixed all house price( Realistic Prices), everyone only buy n sell through HDB with no $$$ gain whether selling off/ upgrade/downgrade, if one is more rich he/she can invest in private properties as their assets.

there is a subtle difference in that previously, buyers know the valuation report and cov right up front. if cov buah gam, they will just let go and look elsewhere. now there is a longer waiting time before the valuation report is out and may stretch the cov beyong what they can afford in cash.

that was why they announced a new scheme for heavily subsidized housing last year IIRC. these can only be bought and sold back to HDB.
 
but for those units already out in the resale market, it is still market forces controlling the prices (buyer wants to buy low, seller wants to sell high)

now change liao.
 
 

Changes on the resale procedure.
HDB will publish daily prices of resale transactions as soon as they are registered, instead of fortnightly after the transactions are approved.
HDB will only accept valuation requests from resale flat buyers (or their appointed salesperson), after the buyers have been granted an Option to Purchase (OTP) by flat sellers. This change will take effect from 5pm, 10 March 2014.
Under the new rules, buyers who are granted OTP will have 21 calendar days to exercise the OTP to adjust to the new procedure.

Scanned copy of the OTP must be submitted for HDB valuation request;
so definitely is price nego first then can get valuation lah.

This should bring down coe.  FO to the dealer bidding on behalf practice. Let car buyers bid instead.
 
There are so may templates from HDB available for tweaking to use for the COE situation.
 
May even take a q from the parenthood scheme incentives to offset COE prices for those with young children.
 
Eg, 7 days child care leave for those w kids <7 yrs. They could also set criteria along these & extend the renew 5yr pqp with option to renew again just like commercial vehecles.......as an example.

yes,should let car buyer ownself go bid COE and pay full cash for new cars.
but gov loves $$$$...so let car dealer bid since they bid sky high, the loan also from bank and bank earns from interest.gov love sky high coe earn even more!!
all these changes to limit cat A to max bhp are just wayang sh*t.
 
now COE has become a money making tools for the gov, the dealers and the banks, instead of it's holy mission to limit car growth only.
good job!

whereas private property buyer can go to bank A,B,C,...Z, until a favourable valuation is found

Do you mean valuation cannot be less than 80% of selling price, since now the selling price got to be agreed first before valuation?
 
In private market - OTP can be written pretty much however you like - with terms and conditions for both parties. 
Dunno if HDB works this way or must use their form and only their form. 
 
I suspect that valuation request will be pegged to Singpass - which will stop people from "posing" to get valuation report.

i suspect there will b many proxy buyers/agents who pretend to be buyers just to get HDB valuation, then go back n nego w real buyer...
 
wonder how garmen will stop this...

I remember hearing that selling price cannot be less than 80% of valuation (to get around people selling "cheap cheap" to family members to avoid stamp duty etc etc) 
 

In private market - OTP can be written pretty much however you like - with terms and conditions for both parties. 
Dunno if HDB works this way or must use their form and only their form.

i found the answer in hdb website liao:
 
HDB prescribed Option to Purchase
Sellers and buyers of resale flats must use the HDB prescribed Option to Purchase (OTP) as the form of
contract in resale transactions. No party is allowed to enter into any other agreement pertaining to the sale
and purchase of the flat as it is null and void pursuant to the Housing and Development Act.
 
Get prescribed Option to Purchase Form from HDB InfoWEB
The prescribed  Option  to  Purchase form  shall  be downloaded from  the  HDB InfoWEB(www.hdb.gov.sg).
No amendments may be made to the prescribed form. Amendments include (but are not limited to) deletions, insertions or altering any provision in the prescribed Option to Purchase form.

the main difference between hdb resale vs private is still "HDB valuation is control by HDB lor",
whereas private property buyer can go to bank A,B,C,...Z, until a favourable valuation is found 

yours is the second comment i read, with the thinking that property valuations differ from bank to bank and buyers can shop for one that gives them highest valuation.  if you have been personal experience in sourcing for private property loan, you certainly won't be spouting such myths.
 
i personally have done so and find that valuations from bank to bank don't differ much and in fact very close to the last done prices reflected on URA portal.  the only time where banks can be seen to be so flexible with their valuations is when they are quoting loan rates for new property which i can only surmise it is due to the fact that banks work on rationale that developers have many units of the same to sell and therefore developer sets the benchmark for selling prices.

Not realli suka suka written however u like lah. There's a pretty std OTP for the pte mkt. Yes, there's flexibility to amend the option period, exercise date, option fee, etc but cannot suka suka add this n that.

usually banks say they can match valuation (their own).

for resale, most times i hear it being uttered by agents who are marketing the property but when i phone my own banker, there is always a discrepancy in this supposedly "matched valuation"

there are so many ways to get around this. buyer can simply pay seller under table $$ rite? aka COV. what's stopping them from doing so? 
 
the problem is not the valuation. the problem is the decades-old, entrenched practice of expecting to get more than what the hdb flat is worth.

when property is on upswing, you tend to be able to see this happening more.  it is more of like each bank's differing optism of the bull run.  and not forgetting even different valuers of hdb property may value it differently by 10k.  % wise, this 10k difference is not much lower than the 30k difference you saw for pte property.

Spoken with agent earlier, his POV, making agent the #1 pest.
 
Buyer will ask agent, how much do you think my house is worth.
Agent replied, say $500k.
 
Marketed for $500k, sold at $500k, evaluation at $600k.
 
Buyer sue the agent for differences?
 
Or in another case, where the evaluation at $400k, you think the buyer will cough out $100k for COV?
 
Even at $1 deposit, OTP to valuation period to final sale take 1 month, if 1st buyer walks off from the sale in the end, seller suffer as inbetween period, seller cannot find another buyer which might pay higher price for the same flat.
 
Yes, it will bring the property price down.
It will also bring jobs on the line, family planning, financial planning along with it.
 
 
Ever wonder why buy big ticket items need such a long tedious process in the first world country?
Buy car, Coe up/down may get screwed. 
Likewise for buying house now, entering blind bidding (last time cost Coe $100k).

Depreciate or not it's only paper value. Many ppl won't even consider selling their flats. Ask yourself, how many % of flats are on sale now? Peanut lah!
 
In fact, most parents are worried for their kids if HDB becomes unaffordable.

Haha. Next time you will be marketing message of agent
"Provide FREE House evaluation" or "100% selling close to valuation".
 
While, buyer agent advertisement to promote themselves is "Say No to COV" or "We get you close to valuation".

You are required to sign on the OTP in exchange for an Option Fee from the buyers. The Option Fee could be a sum between $1 to a maximum of $1,000, to be negotiated between you and the buyers.

This will only work for desperate sellers who had purchased EC or other flat before selling off their current. It would work for short term because those who want to "dispose" their flats urgently they will lower the price. But think further, those who buy flat for profit or rent will not sell it now.
 
Once the "wind" of urgency blows over, the high price will remain. Just observe Bishan, Ang Mo Kio, etc has any of their COV fallen with the CM? I don't know cos I don't use flat as an investment. If they have, then price before evaluation will bring the prices down further. If they had not, then it is only workable for the outskirts HDB flats which is already low in COV.
 
If I were a seller, I will put my flat above the buying prices that I bought for example buy at $500k sell at $650k. Don't agree just walk away, I'm not hard-up to sell anyway. Sooner or later, one "Robert" will come (e.g. PR not able to get new flat only resale). I can wait for the "Robert". And if he backs out, I get $1k extra, I earn.
 
For long term, it would prevent exorbitance prices but it would not lower it down. So the buyer must be prepared after buying at $650k he will not be able to sell higher. But to me, I already earned $150k (some may be COV). I had always believed that EC is the worst investment for someone to jump in. Now they know, EC is STILL under HDB.
 
So long term, mature estate prices will still stay between $800k to $900k (because of convenience especially with high COE). For the outskirts, with all the CMs and this new "agreed price" system, it may starts to flourish as more people will have to move there (e.g. selling flat in mature estate, instead of paying more will choose outskirts flats).
 
So in long term, I would still see it as beneficial to our kids. Keeping the cost low for necessity. For this I will support with both hands and legs.

I feel that the policy of asset enhancement where public housing is concerned has been pushed to the back of the queue. 
 
The catch-22 situation where high prices create problems for the next generation of home-buyers yet form the bedrock of the retirement nest-eggs for retirees and soon-to-be retirees is something that has troubled the policy-makers.
 
The writing is on the wall - the inevitable divergence of public housing and private housing prices is the mantra moving forward.
 
Ironically the short-term pain that this causes is necessary for public housing to serve its original purpose, to house the nation at affordable pricing levels and not function as a get-rich scheme.

If the seller already have other flat to stay, dont think this new ruling will work lo, cause they can take their time to sell their flat.

This is the reason we would support this move. It would stabilize the HDB prices and not let it be used as investment. Investment should always be private not on public expenses.
 
For retirement, CPF is already there so long MIW allows them to draw out and not keep it like for eternity... And they should enhance on the Lease Buyback scheme which didn't kick off because the elderly are afraid that they will end up with no place to stay...

Let's seriously celebrate Singapore's 50 years birthday, I doubt we have many more years to go with such stupid government in place. 

 
Bloody Hell! dun you all see it?
both human & ghost, playing 2 faces all along in the property market - HDB is all along the culprit (y' know who lahhh).
 
If 'they' are so truthful of what they preached 'let market strength takes it strides' then why not put away the Valuation Approval by HDB !!!
 
you see, valuation MUST be approved by HDB..... and so 'they' will manipulate where big tickets are . . . according to initial market trends but latent push/pull to drive where market prices settled.  COV or CUV (whatever it is) are just add-ons to valuation price for market competitiveness (not let alone facilitate bank loans)
 
if they are so 'honest' and 'open' about letting market drives the price, and since transaction prices can be published on daily basis, why can't they publish historical valuations of HDB by disctrict, or even by HDB blocks???
 
as long as OTP (regardless whether its agreed or rejected) is NOT being entered into systems for public views - property agents will survive in this trade to be the middlemen manipulating 'stories' behind to close his/her deals.
 
URA Caveats are result of transactions that are too late for negotiations, just homework to users for benchmarks only.
 
its obvious that this new rule is meant to speed up market deals and put back the transactions figures on the graph, knowingly that there are serious sellers (they are screwed) but lesser or hold-back buyers!
a.  C'mon, cooling measures mainly affect the private property and those with 2 or more assets owners only.
b.  Its principles are NOT to put down prices, but rather 'protect' local domestic bankings from bubble-burst!
c.  In preparations for the coming competitions from world banks into our Sillypore Finance Hub 2015
Afterall, it is a. and b. that have been instrumental in driving the market prices so far.
 
Look carefully, if HDB had been so thoughtful - why dun 'they' control their land prices as well as developers' prices to buyers when state lands are sold for residences? 
 
In private properties, its been so easy for the developers, those who owns multiple within that area to control transactions prices.  URA Caveats are just their proofs of result.  Sky-high valuations are just bankers tools to boost more loans.  this is where those cooling measures work on . . . .
 
If HDB have sticked into their principles that HDB is for citizenships, then it'd not have been driven up for 'PRs'......!
If Uncle Lee have kept his promises for citizenships to be able to own assets, then rules could have objectively set to control this requirements..... i.e 2nd property to be sold or for rentals at restricted amounts.
 
Heh! do you know how much was made from HDB flats???
HDB flats are :
- transacted at todays price
- built from yesterdays cost (you dunno what's the raw materials transacted at; what if I tell its invoived 20-30 years ago)
- managed at 3rd countries labors
- from land that is priced up by developers
 
 
initially, I fear that youngsters with their pays are not able to cope with the HDB price
now, I fear that they may have to wait for their turns even with $.
lastly, their ages to clear their mortgages will shoot up!
 
Living in Sillypore...... sigh, its just get no better!

When you submit the OTP to hdb, have to indicate the agreed selling price and the deposit amount paid to seller.

So if the 1k is between buyer and seller only, both parties can probably just agree to declare that 1k is paid(but bedek only), just for the sake of getting the valuation, in a situation where both parties would prefer to know valuation before agreeing on the price.
 
Correct?

Buyer and seller will have a copy of the OTP signed with agreed price.
 
It's legally enforceable. 
 
If verbally agree to bedek bedek before the valuation, wait one party choose to go with black and white after valuation issued, how?

Ya lor, the price is signed and agreed upon between both parties. If really like you said, declare $1K but under table only paid $1.00, and later if any argument or dispute then problem liao.

i think he refers to the first buyer as kaki lang just to get the valuation report in order for the seller to quote to the next buyer.

Yah exactly, seller only need the valuation once, or even if for some reason cannot bedek the 1k, seller can even fork out 1k, ask relative bedek as buyer 1st, agree on any price, submit, get valuation, then relative pretend reject sale, then so called 1k burn. But now this seller has a valuation to keep for next potential buyers

for all benefit, this OTP deposit is not 100% guarantee that you'll get to buy.

then when time come seller say don't want to sell and cannot refund the deposit !!
 
then tell my uncle to sue him.

The OTP, once issued by seller to buyer with OTP fee taken, cannot be retracted by seller. 
 
Buyer then has 21 days to exercise that option. Buyer can withdraw by not exercising, but seller cannot.  This is why seller has 7 days cooling period after going through the resale checklist before they can issue the OTP. That 7 days is for them to think carefully if they really want to sell.
 
Your uncle can bring up this case to HDB since he has the signed OTP with him.

After OTP signed , buyer can back out , seller cannot .
 
For your uncle's case , dont even need to go to lawyer , the agent handling the sale should be able to resolve the matter .

Usually the OTP fee is at least $1000 which is the market rate to give. I have a friend who bought a resale, try to offer less than $1000 to the seller but seller relectant to accept and tell my friend minimum is $1000 lo.
 
Anyway, if buyer dun want to buy, the OTP fee cannot take back. But if seller dont want to sell, is there a rule saying that seller have to return the OTP fee to buyer?

Similar case for my own. Didn't want to go above 10 so press price. If I had settled at seller's asking, I would have paid 25 CoV.

Not all seller still can press for price after valuation is known. Some seller is either you take it or leave it. Some buyer also willing to pay for the cov, take it that they can afford to pay for the house price lo, whether it is part of the cov or not. Lol.

So had some sleepless nights reading on what other people paid for and then best guessed and prayed my price was right.

Maybe that house is made of gold or something special as compared with others unit? I also seen before some place some unit can sell so much higher than the area can fetch, so i guess there should be something special about that unit that people willing to pay? Lol.

Lol.They wanted their reno cost back. So I took into account other units in similar areas valuation and arrived at my offer price lo. I was lucky in the sense that I did view a similarly reno-ed unit not too far away and knew the valuation on that one since a buyer dropped out.  
Both units were initially asking 720-780. Both valuation under 650.
 
Their agent did mention that they would still like some cash back and we agreed on 10k. Heng ah really is 10k.

You mean back then you are able to know the cov before otp?

I believe many owners wanted their reno cost back when they sell their house, thats why resulted in so high cov lo. In a way they can tell you their unit is different as compared with others unit, esp those original condition.

Did your uncle engage an agent to act on his behalf? Once OTP has been issued to you and you are holding on to it....you are king.  ONLY you can back out, the seller, once he has signed, LL the ball is out of his court.  The buyer just need to put his signature down and present the OTP to his lawyer and just wait for completion.  Basically, he can sue for `specific performance’ but i think dun even need to go down that route.  Technically can even chase the fellow out of the house.  It’s really strange that your uncle even lost money when he has the upper hand with OTP on hand.

depends whether you wanna spend 5 years challenging this or just move on to another hdb. One thing is for sure, I will make the fellow return the OTP money.

I have a friend that is thinking to buy a unit in Punggol that is less than MOP. 
Unit asking for him 525K and the actual valuation is at 470K, would you pay for that COV?
To think the agent has the cheek to ask my friend to appeal for the valuation to match?
Seems like an easy way to earn from potential buyers the 1k deposit.
Anyone who wish to know exact unit and agent, feel free to pm
