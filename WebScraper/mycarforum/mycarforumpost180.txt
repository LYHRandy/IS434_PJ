Phillip Ave off Yio Chu Kang Rd has one. The fork rd has a Japanese cemetery on one side but a normal terrace houses at the other. But that house always remains empty and uncared for. Always pass the house while going to school last time n i have never seen the house occupied for the 4yrs i pass by everday n it looks kinda spooky!  [sweatdrop]

Actually why is fengshui bad? There are plenty of buildings that have such shape edges in Raffles Place, those also bad meh? The corner is pointing at others what.

So the solution is to rezone this piece and build non-residential building.

Fengshui is actually a science between human and his living environment.
 

So to the moment you enter a house and you feel the house is not right for you, or no good feeling, the house is already bad fengshui for you.

Feng shui may be an individual thing. On the practical side, land use can't be maximized & is limited due to the odd shape.

3+ million is not exactly cheap.
 

I mean you can buy a smaller landed somewhere in a good location for the same price.
 

Why spend the money on a bigger plot of land if you cannot even go outside or built anything on it due to the setback requirements.

Fengshui good or bad i dont know, the only thing i know no good is next to bus-stop. Next to bus-stop quite noisy from the bus stopping and moving off. You can even hear the commuters tapping their ezlink card!

The law of supply and demand applies. If Far East really wants to sell the place ... keep reducing the price and I am certain someone will buy whether good Fengshui or not. It seems ridiculous to keep it empty all this while. If they advertise this house at 2.5-2.6M ... I am certain it will attract demand and an eventual sale. However, whoever thought it was a good idea to build that house ...
