If the survey is for fun is fine , otherwise the result won't be meaningful because the population size is too small. Moreover, for the result to be more meaningful, the data has to cut into the other dimension which is income level.

These days, those with cash but still taking bank loan as loan rate was lower than deposits and returns on low risk investments are reconsidering this strategy. It used to be a no brainer as there was no incentive to repay housing loans so why not keep your cash?
 
Fast forward today and rising interest rates meant that loans are getting more expensive and with deposit and returns of some investments not keeping up, it would be prudent to repay your loans with excess cash instead of sitting on it, my 2 cents.....

To be honest.. our era much easier to do all this...
now property markets are stable at higher levels.. no correction... almost impossible to buy dirt cheap when people panic.
 
difficult to flip and make the downpayment... 
 
when i stepped into the working society... i had a lady boss(7yrs my senior) who leveraged heavily and bought 3 properties (2005~2006), got hit stop loss trigger (lack of rental revenue)... had to cut back on all spending and ask for family help to survive... 
 
She retired 10yrs ago...

It's a misunderstanding that properties not fully paid up belongs to the bank.
 
Sure, the mortgage (loan) comes from (is financed by) the bank.
 
But the amount that is paid up (equity) belongs to the owner. A bank can force sell an unpaid mortgage to recover only the amount of mortgage unpaid. The amount paid up still belongs to the owner and that is recoverable after a forced sale.
 
If equity loan is possible, according to current regulations, a retiree needs to maintain at least 50% paid up before triggering forced sale. If a forced sale takes place with 50% paid up, the owner can recover at least 30-40% of the property current price (paid up capital equity) as well.

When pay housing loan using cpf do take note of valuation limit.
Once a person hits Valuation Limit, it won't be long before he hits CPF Withdrawal Limit (120% of VL). 
The rules are there all along. You can't borrow from your CPF forever. This is a good thing.

a lot of people are not aware of this rule. 
 
A lot of DIY buyers doesn't know this. Some didn't even know about CPF restriction for properties above 39 years old.
 
1) The only time when the CPF doesn't have limit is when you take a HDB loan for a BTO.  For this, you can use your CPF until the loan is fully paid of.
 
2) If you take HDB loan for resale or DBSS, there is a Valuation limit. When the CPF hits the VL, you need to set aside the BRS. 
 
3) If you take bank loan for HDB (regardless new or resale) or DBSS, there will be VL and Withdrawal limit (WL). WL being 120% of VL. When VL is reached, BRS has to be set aside, any extra then can service up to WL.
 
4) For private property, same as (3) above.
 
The above rules have been there for the longest time.

The equity term loan interest rate follows the mortgage rate but might be extended beyond 65 years old.
 
In an interest-dropping environment where one of your mortgages is in locked in period, yes, you may take an equity term loan on another paid up property. It doesn't have to be fully paid up if you have the income and some more working years ahead to back it.
 
But in an interest-rising environment like right now, such opportunities will be rare indeed.
 
Maybe in 2020 or 2021, there might be a chance for rate cuts again, but not guaranteed as well. Caveat emptor.
