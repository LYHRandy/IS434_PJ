quite a lot of carpentry work (except the living room). Overlay the whole bathroom wall and also flooring. Pricing could be slightly lower. Definitely can find other ID with lower cost .

Just a word of advice from an old man. Do understand you home is for show flat or for your own family use before you decide what to do.
 
If you are planning for kids, safety and consideration for them must be planned in advanced. Sharp corners, mirror/glass, congested space with open shelves display, direct access to kitchen or hot areas, etc. 
 
Show flats are for show. Try spreading those cutlery on your dinning table daily for a normal family.

a special knife for cutting carrots lol
 
but carpentry does cost quite a bit lah. So this number is inflated but not really as cheap as what some naysayers make it out to be.
 
but i think floor to ceiling wardrobes are good in terms of don't accumulate dust at the top. I don't really mind paying for that.

Would have used part of the money to pay off the housing loan faster and maybe even invest in another property. Would be ridiculous if they had to pile on another big reno loan just to achieve all this.

Carpentry is not cheap, but def not that price. I have a full height feature wall, 2 full height display cab, 1 full height shoe rack, 1 full height wardrobe, bedframe, kitchen top and bottom, full height pantry cab, full height bookshelf and table and I remember is around 25kish. From the pics, the walk in wardrobe is not shown but I don't think it justify 55k.

The home owner works for the ID and pretends to be a customer is bad enough.
 
But telling viewers customer 70k budget exceeded by another 25k and 6 weeks delay
 
is just bad marketing.
 
Bluff the viewer is one thing but making yourself look bad at the same time is sheer
 
stupidity.
 
Who is going to watch this and say that's the ID I want.
 
One that over run my budget by 25k and delay moving in by 1 and a half month.

Some cover up main drainage,  run own aircon drainage under the floor. What I did was I chose to rerun the aircon and not chase the old pipes, then seal the old drain.

Minimalism is a theme of design and concept, not a description of bareness.
 
To create that theme, huge costs are involved.

The best minimalist design to me for HDB is stock condition and only do up essential reno like wardrobes,flooring,  kitchen cabinet, air-cons, and maybe a simple TV console.
 
 HDB with expensive reno is challenging to sell....simply because the seller wants top dollar for his reno investment, but the buyer's mind is he is going to incur a lot of $$$ to teardown. So  you really need to wait for a buyer who appreciates the reno and willing to pay for the reno premium the seller is asking.
 
One of the hdb that I sold at record price few months back has only essential reno (flooring, full height wardrobe, aircon, kitchen cabinet, lightings). There are no fancy shelves, storage cabinets, platform bed, wall paper, cove lightings, etc, etc. The house is well maintain and neat.  Simple , neat, clean with just essential reno and it was sold at a record price. You really don't need fancy renovations.

agreed. worst part is that the owners insist for the unit to be sold at a high price because of the reno cost.

And in any case, everybody has their own individual tastes and preferences.
Design / colours / themes and the appreciation of it, are very subjective and to the interpretation of the buyer/home owner. 
It also varies to individual needs (e.g. aesthetic display / show, entertainment, networking, storage, disability etc.) 
 
Personally, I would rather buy a home in basic / stock condition and do it up to my own preference. Having a pre-renovated home that can fit my preferences is a bonus. In any case, it is always good to stick to a theme that is quite neutral and not too OTT or trendy. Trends and fashion will fade with time. Simplistic themes never go out of style.
