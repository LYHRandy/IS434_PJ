$600K is peanuts to them and most with $xmillion/annum income.  It's publicity for the PR's and those considering citizenship showing them one side of the coin while the other side is for them to find out ,perhaps someday ending up like us   ?

sometimes they should connect with the citizens. not all of us are rich. they say its affordable, but normal class working people may not think so.
 

they have lost touch with the common man. this would be an issue the OPPS will want to highlight.

i think year 2008/2009 is the nail in the coffin.  this is the year where they make many singaporeans unhappy.
 

but surprisingly they will still win the 2012 GE comfortably.

They will win but I only hope that the support will drop drastically from 66% to 50%+ will give them some idea and hope will wake them up a bit......

how much they win by will depend on how united the opposition parties are. if they are like loose sand, then the winning margin will be higher.
