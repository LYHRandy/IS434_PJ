Hi all,
 
Just wondering whats the best thing to do or rather what are my options if i have access in OA account and still servicing a HDB bank loan.
Theres about enough to pay 24months of installments in my OA(cos my house is dirt cheap so installment is pretty low)
Is there any way i can make advanced payments or clear my OA to decrease the total sum?
If yes, is that a smart move?
 
What else can i do with this access?
 
Thanks in advanced guys

unless your loan can be fully redeemed with the current excess funds, it is always prudent to keep a certain number of months of installments in the oa depending on your comfort level just in case you lose your job or are in between jobs...

dont forget each time u earn payoff some sum there is admin fee.
unless the fee can offset by the interests saving else for what? use that money for other investment better still.
and first 20k or 30k is 3.5% if not wrong. still higher then what u paying 2.6%.

Unless you are really sure you don't need the money, better just keep paying the additional 0.1% interest which is pretty insignificant. Keep the OA on hand.
 
say you owe 200k, the additional interest in 1 year is just 200 bucks?

most of the time, after lock in period should have no admin fee. 
 
if you pay off during the lock in period, then no pt.

You can just login HDB page to clear all or a certain amount from your CPF. No admin fee for HDB loan.
 
Advisable to keep some in your OA as if you have intention to buy the next housing before selling.  U can utilize the next 15% from your OA, if you clear everything meaning it will be lock inside your existing house and u will need to come out with cash first.

After you finish paying your HDB loan, you may want to consider paying your CPF loan... Take a look at your accrued interest.

Why worry about your accrued interest unless you plan to take equity out of your flat in the future?

Accrued interest is a very interesting sleight-of-hand. It comes down to this: do you think CPFB should be paying you interest or the buyer of your flat?
 
It also ensures the seller doesn't get too much cash when he sells the flat.
 
Accrued interest compounding at 2.5% can add up quite a bit after a few years.
 
I have used up so much CPF funds that I owe myself more interest per year than I owe the bank, and this number goes up every year.
 
I prefer not to owe anyone any money -- including myself.

my repayment was kinda weird ...
 
when i left a small amount of loan (a few Ks), i went to HDB and told them i wanted to clear the loan one shot with my CPF, which was more than sufficient.
 
however, the staff at the area office told me that i would have to pay the final sum in CASH if i wanted do that.
 
so i just told her to forget it and continue with my CPF monthly deductions instead.
Next time tell them you wanna pay off everything with coffee except for 1 dollar

I think the staff must have got the facts wrong.  
You will need to pay a small sum for legal fees when you clear your loan. This is regardless if you are paying till the end of your installments or clearing it one lump sum.
 
If I recall this amount can be paid by cpf as well.

You can do partial repayment anytime. I'm keeping 12 to15 months worth of monthly repayment in the OA and do partial repayment every year to reduce the interest.

Now, the interest is minor only.

So is your house cheap or expensive?
 
From my inference... It's dirt cheap but u bought during the peak?
 
Hard to reconcile.

Hard to reconcile.

 
let me put it in point form so u can understand better:
 
- cheap as compared to other houses
 
- i bought during peak (despite it being more on the high side, it is still relatively cheaper than other houses)
 
5mil for a banglow in Sentosa is cheap, yet 5mil is still ex for a house.
 
Ada paham?

I hear u.
 
And you r right in a way. It's all relative.
 
Like what I said, just find it hard to reconcile "dirt cheap" and "buying during the peak".
 
It's like my friend telling me "hey I bought an Altis at 140k during the Coe peak and it's dirt cheap."
 
Btw. U Malay?

Pay or dun pay off hdb loan is something to think about but the question certainly is not the interest. You either owe hdb 2.6% or owe cpf 2.5%.... lppl 
 
You pay off cos you wanna reduce your loan ratio etc.... You keep cos you may wanna use it instead of cash for next property purchase etc. 
 
Unless cpf and hdb interest differential is more than 0.5%...... if not dun need to think so hard..... Unless you are Lim Swee Say.

The best and clearest statement of truth on this matter, lppl. Only way to avoid this is one uss own cash.

actually CPF is still our money as interest. But HDB 2.6% is something u can't get back at all.
