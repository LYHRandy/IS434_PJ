1. the maximum loan repayment period is 65 years minus the buyer’s age or 25 years..whichever is shorter
 
2. assuming the $1k you paid was all from CPF & you paid 20% downpayment & you took HDB loan..you'll get a profit of approximately ~$62.5k before deducting all fees/duties..please check with HDB directly..however if you paid all full cash for the $1k monthly repayment..all sales proceeds will be in cash
 
3. depends on your current age..the loan tenure is shorter as one grows older

Thank you.

Q1. Max age for loan is 65. 
Q2. If you did not use CPF. You just need to minus the outstanding loan and agent commission. If you use CPF, you have to minus the CPF you used, interest accrued, outstanding loan and agent commission. The balance is what you get back in cash.
Q3. HDB loan up to 90%, max year is 25. Interest is fixed at 2.6%. You can calulate the monthly using online calculator. Just search for it.
 
Q4. Best price ? Find a good agent should get you teh best price. Sell your self, you never know what is a good price.
 
Cheer...

1. Not sure, please check HDB
2. Selling price - outstanding loan (check with bank) - CPF used (log on cpf website and check)
3. Not sure but it will also depend on your income. Use this calculator to get an estimate: http://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP27MaxLoan/BP27PMax1.jsp
4. Why not check similar transactions on hdb website? http://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BB33RTIS/BB33PReslTrans.jsp

why sell hdb flat and re-buy a resale hdb flat?
your main intention is to cash out?
 
log in to your cpf and check the "accrued interest" - the amount need to go back to cpf.
but this one should be no problem since you can use the $$ to buy the next property

You can try getting an agent to work out the details for you. The market is not so good for sellers, you can put up your place for viewing to get a feel of the offers if any.

Qns 1 - 65 minus loanee current
Qns2 - Selling price-outstanding-refund to CPF with interested - Agent fees = Cash get back
Qns3 - How many time have you get loan from HDB? HDB can get loan 2 times. Depending on how much you have in your CPF at the point of transaction. Buying price - CPF balance = loan amount.

u can dl Mobile@HDB App and check all transacted prices at your area, even your blk number, and floor level.
 
this app also can show the sale proceeds, sales calculation. buying flat, and whatever services you need.   
 
no one can really answer your Q.2 and Q.3 without you telling us how much did you paid for your tampines flat, whether you used CPF to pay, how much dp you paid last time, your real age, income level...........
 
One very impt advice, before you trust any agent to do work for you, make sure you do your own homework and know exactly what is going on, right down to $$$ amount for everything. 
 
Some agents are not so helpful or may try to smoke you.  Times are bad for agents now, they may do anything to close a deal.  They don't really care about your questions or family concerns.

just spend $25 attend the HDB resale seminar. You will learn all you need to know about buying and selling HDB
 
It is very simple process and any doubts just email HDB they will get back to you.
 
unless you are so busy (like not even having 10mins to surf MCF during the day) then get an agent to do it for you

i have a very stupid BIL that has no money to give allowance to his aging parents but can afford to pay VMM hundreds of dollars for her air tickets and other stuffs. and not for sex, becos the VMM is married, has a Singaporean husband and a 6 years old son. what is worst than this is, my BIL is impotence. his wife told us all these after she caught him by engaging a PI. 
 
so i have to shoulder the responsibility of housing them or they have to roam on the street.

You just need to repay whatever amount you had withdrawal from cpf and the rest will be cash proceeds. However for your second purchase if using HDB loan, 50% of the cash proceeds from your first purchase will be needed to put in.

Hi guys,
 
i'm appealing for a hardworking agent that has the drive to sell my HDB unit at a highest possible price. I'm looking to upgrade to a 5 rooms HDB flat in Tampines area after this existing unit is sold.
 
The info of my present unit is as followed;
 
1. 4 rooms, high floor, unblock, all bedrooms and kitchen window are north facing. very very windy anytime of the year. (see pictures attached)
 
2. its a corner unit, very spacious, look like a 5 rooms flat with a purchased recess balcony, area is approx 115 SQM,  lift landing, friendly neighbours.
 
3. No carpark crunch issue. 10 mins drive to major highway like PIE, ECP and TPE.
 
4. Eatery, shops and convenience stores are just next block.
 
5. Very centralise, 12 mins walk to simei MRT or 15 mins walk to Tampines MRT.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
are you confident to market my unit?
PM me your portfolio and tell me how much i could fetch from my unit.
 
Thanks

Just wondering, did you manage to sell your flat 1st and after that get a resale? If not, have you factor in that you probably need to get a temporary accommodation after selling your flat 1st as it is unlikely you can move in to your 2nd flat so fast.

it depends, cos everyone probably have the same requirement so if more buyers, then he may not have time to update you.

Was that during the time when the seller's agent could still makan commission from both sides?
 
Since you already found the unit, you should have asked a buddy (who is also an agent) to handle the transaction. Then he can cashback some of the commission to you or treat you to a big makan.

i thought now is buyer seller agree on the price then go for valuation? so you can still agree on a lower price among that area.

Can, a relative did it before.
 
If unrealistically low, they may ask for a declaration process.
 
But basically the "buyer" needs to satisfy all criteria (income, family, citizenship, previous ownership of properties etc) of HDB ownership.

coz I read on a blog that the transaction price must be the valuation price. but since the last govt review, dunno if any changes.
 
btw, I also read that ppl with more than 6k pay cannot get HDB loan ?

so if my parents place valuation is about 450k ... can my sister buy over at 300k ?
 
actually my parents want her to include her name into the occupant list .... but my mom was thinking of freeing up her CPF from the house.
 
or can my sister just buy over from one of my parents ? of the mentioned criteria, my sis is a local single +35 and never owned property before.

the new rule is not dependent on the valuation i think, i guess you can base on the lower price than valuation before the valuation is done.
 
for transfer of name, better to go HDB and ask in more detail.

Think you declare 400k is okay.
 
IIRC, valuation is used for determining how much bank and HDB will loan to you whereas actual transacted price (or declared transacted price) is used for calculation of tax and duties.

coz I read on a blog that the transaction price must be the valuation price. but since the last govt review, dunno if any changes.
 
btw, I also read that ppl with more than 6k pay cannot get HDB loan ?

 
so if my parents place valuation is about 450k ... can my sister buy over at 300k ?
 
actually my parents want her to include her name into the occupant list .... but my mom was thinking of freeing up her CPF from the house.
 
or can my sister just buy over from one of my parents ? of the mentioned criteria, my sis is a local single +35 and never owned property before.

1. more than 6k also can take hdb loan iirc. now salary ceililng is 12k i think. 14 k for ec.
 
2. if you want to sell below valuation. i think HDB will step in. because it's is not just a willing seller, willing buyer scenario. also have to take into account CPF. if too low, then the parents need to put up cash into their cpf to top up. 
 
although can sell below valuation. but got other criterior to fulfil too. better check it up with hdb.

HDB can also be gifted away or willed to immediate family members or even unrelated friends for genuine reasons (IIRC a list of 6 valid reasons).
 
Just to prevent foul play (forged signature, duping, misrepresentation etc), declaration is required.
 
"Buying" from one member should be possible since even the removal of name of 1 person requires the person's CPF previously used for the property to be reimbursed.
 
For details, best to confirm with HDB. Just set up an appointment or visit HDB office to enquire on the procedures.

For HDB and Bank loan, you will not need to top up the shortfall for the Required CPF Refund if you have sold your flat at market value. Market value is the valuation of your HDB flat.If you have sold the flat below valuation, you will need to pay CPF the full amount of the Required CPF Refund, even if your sale proceeds isn't enough to cover the amount. You will need to come up with the cash and pay CPF. Translated: You will not receive any proceeds from the sale of your HDB flat, and instead, you will need to cough up cash to refund CPF.
 
and please note that some change on ruling recently

tapping on to this thread ....
 
anyone bought over your parent's flat ?
 
can the transaction price be under valuation ?
 
anything criteria to fulfil ?

 
eh bro.
 
out of curiosity i have asked my hdb pals on this. 
 
and apparently if the transactional price and valuation too big gap. like what you described, then there will be a red flag. potentially might scupper the deal.
 
if the flat is fully paid off. a better alternative would be for them to "gift" the flat to your sis. just arrange paperwork at hdb and transfer to her name. and then the cash portion settle seperately. just that depends on "trust" lor

that's why i said then the cash settle offline lor.
 
that's one way to get around it.
 
otherwise even if hdb allow you to sell so much below valuation. after repayment to cpf and all the misc stamp fee etc, you also won't get much cash, if at all. most will be back inside the cpf.

CPF used must still return one lah.
 
They will take cheque make sure the CPF of the transferee is enough under normal situations.
 
Extraordinary situations think must check with HDB safer.

the scenario is abit complicated ...
 
both my parents already 75 years old ... so I guess they can take whatever they have inside their CPF account right ?
 
so if my sis buys the flat from them, they can take out the almost all the cash from the transaction ?
 
also the flat is fully paid long time ago already ... bought at 80k in 1989 ... so I even at 80k loan, at the most need to put back total 180k into their CPF now ... so even if my sis buys at 300k, should be more than enough to cover the CPF part. Anything more, my parents will receive in cash right ? eg in this case, about 120k ? if so, then if my sis buys at 400k, then my parents will similarly receive 220k in cash - or the total of 300k or 400k which they will then return to my sis again ...
 
I might be wrong ... coz most of my understanding is hearsay.
 
I will check with HDB when things are confirmed ... but right now just asking around for more information so won't be caught unaware when we visit HDB.

CPF and HDB are two different organisation, whether can take the $220K out and leave $180K as minimum retire sum have to be clear from CPF. This part has to check with CPF.
 
for your sis to buy at $400K, she has to fork out from her CPF or take loan to pa. If your parents can cash out the $22)k and pass to her at later stage, she will then use the money to offset against the loan amount.

Yah confirmed extraordinary case.
 
Other than scheduling walk-ins, you can also choose to write in to HDB and/or CPF to check as well.
 
They may schedule a few appointments to clear everything with your family.
 
They will not force you to make decisions on the spot so after that you can decide over the remaining sessions which can stretch for months.
 
Do keep us updated for reference.

Some information below.  
 	How much do I need to refund to my CPF upon the sale of my HDB flat?
If you have used your CPF savings to finance your HDB flat, you will have to refund to your CPF:
the principal CPF amount (P) which you have withdrawn for the HDB flat; and
the accrued interest (I) which you would have earned if the savings were not taken out from your CPF account.
If you are 55 years old and above, and have pledged your property to withdraw your Retirement Account (RA) savings in cash, you will need to refund the pledged amount on top of the P and I. The amount refunded to your CPF account will be used to meet your Full Retirement Sum in your RA. After this, any balance housing refunds will be paid to you in cash.

no idea ... mom stopped working as a factory line operator in her 60s .... dad was a taxi driver.
 
CPF mentioned that my dad will have to put 28k back into his a/c but then they will release it full back to him a a few months.
 
whereas my mom will have to put back 80k ... and then they will give her half of it in a few months and the balnce half will disburse over the next 5-10 years.
 
very complicated .... just like choosing between butter and margarine.

I supposed many silver hair generation are affected by the changes in the employment landscape and hence, the usual risk adverse nature of most flat buyers are to have a wait and see attitude OR at least, make some sense of the commit and "what if" scenario before they embarked on the single biggest ticket item in life.

Looking at the ramp up and build of the flat and the larger then usual balance, seems like a storm is brewing on the ground.

According to the article, quite surprisingly that quite a huge number of balance flats are from mature estate close to the city?

Not only queenstown la, all those hdb housing which is city fridge or near to city is good for people working in town area. This is why the house price for these area always much more expensive, whether BTO or resale.

The SERS location is near train station. So hyper convenient.
