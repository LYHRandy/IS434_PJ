 Huge cabinet in Sembawang condo unit collapses due to 'poor workmanship' and inferior materials
Posted on 21 February 2016 | 30,264 views | 7 comments



 

Stomper Howard's kitchen cabinet at a condominum unit in Canberra Residences suddenly collapsed last Wednesday (Feb 17).

 
After reporting the incident to the Building and Construction Authority (BCA), the Stomper was informed that the collapse was a result of 'poor workmanship' and the use of inferior materials. 
 
The matter however was between the Stomper and the developer of the unit and both parties will have to decide on the proper course of action following the incident. 
 
Parts of Howard's kitchen including the stove and other cabinets at the bottom were also damaged as a result of what happened.  
 
The Stomper has been staying at the condominuim unit for less than two years.

So that's what contractors do when the wall surface is not properly plastered: fix two strips of wood to it and mount cabinets to the wood strips!!

And they really took short cut, how come no wall tiles. Paying so much for this kind of lousy cheapo workmanship and construction!
 
My kitchen is 2.5 to 3 times bigger.

Maybe they use double-sided tape to mount the whole cabinet?

That is probably the only way they can have enough quota to keep their skilled workers. Nowadays tia gong very hard to apply for new work permit even for construction sector.

As far as I am aware BCA won't give a hoot about these kind of kitchen cabinet collapse. They only concern if there is structural cracks.
 
I also notice these days condos use dry wall instead of brick wall for their units. Not sure if this is a scheme by BCA to improve construction productivity.

they should change rule where before any BTO, EC, condo, etc  launch, must state clearly the contractor for buyer to decide . this will ensure they have good track record for buyer to trust, if screw up like this kind of cut corner contractor, people will siam away... nowadays, knn.. apply BTO without knowing who the F will build it sounds scary... 
 
..ec and condo not sure known upfront or not since cannot afford, never find out more info of new launch......

They will always talk about productivity , productivity, productivity and profits, finally there is no craftsmanship, just workmanship 
I've seen tile layers whom can't even tile on a straight line even despite thread lines been drawn up, bathrooms (shower area) which are supposed to tilt towards the sink hole even ponding, contractors are also having a hard time getting workers somehow with quotas and just take a chance of "chin chye" do and hope to get away scot free without the owner knowing (especially 1st time home buyers)

I noticed some comments talking about the fact that the rear of the cabinet is un-tiled and also uses strips of wood between cabinet and wood.
 
I would like to clarify to as far as I know, that is standard procedure when you redo your kitchen for example.
 
The part that will be covered by cabinets will be left un-tiled by contractor UNLESS you insist on it being tiled - which may in cases lead to additional charge.
 
Also custom cabinets will have a few strips of horizontal plywood attached to the back of the cabinet. Long mounting screws (self-tarping with dowels; very secure) will punch through the cabinet and the plywood strips to attach to wall. The gap is covered up by formica (laminate) to make the cabinet look seemless.

No leh bro, full tiling should be the standard. Next time change cabinet how? One ugly patch of wall, half tiled half cement.
 
Not complete tiling is shoddy work and cheating.

the problem is that nowadays they just think after 30-40 years can have en-bloc is not a right way to look at things, population patterns might change and there are indeed some very old apt blocks still up and around (mostly walk up type) and then there are houses here which are more than 100 years old still standing proudly
 
we have been (so far) quite very so lucky not to have been affected by any earthquakes  n if its tsunami's all better run up to Mt Faber or Bt.Timah

In SG, buildings very unlikely to collapse due to kiasi standards by BCA
 
however do be aware that worksmanship will be poor if u buy a new condo that was constructed in the past 8 yrs
 
nothing to do with how much u have paid. it is just that rush of projects + thin developer margins = lousy quality
hence another reason why to not buy a new project when everyone is rushing to buy
 
other than the higher price driven up by demand
 
the quality will also be generally poorer

No wonder there are so many quality problems in new flats now! Hopefully nothing will happen 10-30 years down the road for these flats, as most bto flats now build at least 20-40 story high!

In SG, buildings very unlikely to collapse due to kiasi standards by BCA
 
 
as Wyfitms posted ... whole building wont collapse due to BCA kiasi guidelines
but ... parts broken here there everywhere lor .... so called "imperfection" ... muahahaha
 
No wonder there are so many quality problems in new flats now! Hopefully nothing will happen 10-30 years down the road for these flats, as most bto flats now build at least 20-40 story high!

however do be aware that worksmanship will be poor if u buy a new condo that was constructed in the past 8 yrs
 
nothing to do with how much u have paid. it is just that rush of projects + thin developer margins = lousy quality
 
hence another reason why to not buy a new project when everyone is rushing to buy
 
other than the higher price driven up by demand
 
the quality will also be generally poorer

Er, just about every damn thing was constructed in the past 8 yrs......
So you advise not to buy.  Ok ok i wont buy
 
Eh, but you still advise people to buy becos price always going up leh?
So you advising to buy or not to buy.
If dont buy and i hv already two extra, should i sell?
 
Mai confuse leh

SG buildings are able to withstand minor tremors. All high-rise are also built to have tolerances for movement/swaying. tbh unless friend is architect, gotta take his word with a pinch of salt.  But then again, maybe architect design/planning is all good, but building koyak and never follow.

I think they will say that there are lapses in the installation lor.
 
If I'm not wrong they might have run out of heavy duty wall plugs to secure the cabinets and they use those plastic wall plugs instead. The foreign workers couldn't care less what they use to secure the cabinets.

I have done my part of DIYs around the house so I know where to buy them and how to install heavy items on the walls.
 
For furniture wise there are hardly any solid wood unless you recycle really old furnitures. All are compressed chipboards made to form plywood. All are cheapskate material. Pre-fabricated by a carpenter, size given by the contractor and finish using fake wood finish to give the expensive look. All are cheap to construct. That's why contractors can make a lot of money. Looks expensive but all are made up of compressed chipboards underneath.
 
If you think your home's cabinet is made out of quality material becoz you paid premium for it you will be so wrong. All of them use the same cheap method.

Iron wall plugs are usually for structural use. to withstand loads in tons... 
 
plastic wall plugs can serve the same purpose for wall cabinets as long as they are calculated to be able to withstand max load. having said that, i guess no interior contractors do calculation for wall cabinet mountings. 
 
compressed chipboards should not be used for furniture as they can literally disintegrate when exposed to moisture.

China developer and contractor - almost guaranteed to have problems. When searching for a condo, I always check who is the developer and if possible (if already appointed) the contractor. The moment it is a China developer I will not waste my time visiting the showflat. Unfortunately many are clueless about this. Their choices also seem to be limited as China developers are now muscling into  all the suburban areas, winning most of the land bids.

yes  they call the wood look " veneer" basically like a piece of shaven eal wood and glued on to the plywood usualy used for wardrobes, but kitchen ones I think still they use solid wood , but never know now-a-days  maybe got good fake ones too; n yes they use those plastic wall plugs many a times (i do it for light wall stuff) but I remember my contractor worker use those so called "Hilti" guns

So people now have to bear with the defects found in their flats, even though the building would not collapse. Then have to wait for hdb HIP to rectify the problems on their flat. But i always wonder what is the selection cateria for SERS project on HDB flat? How come some hdb flats only about 30 years old got SERS, whereas some flats 40-50 years old still not selected for SERS?

It's just the finishing that looks attractive, European design or what I highly doubt it. To make up the thickness it's that layer of plywood made out of chipboard underneath. In Singapore you won't find solid wood in cabinets or cupboards. You can tell the difference by weight. If it's made out of solid wood you will see your contractor hiring lots of foreign workers to carry your cabinets to your home before installing them. When you see that 2-3 workers can move them like cardboards you know they are plywood made out of chipboards.

if its plywood its fine (my mothers house cupboards are over 20 years old ) are OK but if its chip board or those compressed fibreboard or MDF or what ever fancy terms they have .... just stay away... its all like Ikea stuff......
 
My kitchen cabinets are solid wood, i got one of those guys in Sungei Kadut to do it, but only thing is that it will look like those old fashioned designs and not stylo milo and designs are limited as they bring in fixed sizes of doors, cabinets covers
 
Of course as its like with all contractors ..... it finally ends with a dispute or quarrel after completion ... due to worker did not leave enough time between varnishing coats.... my experience and I think most peoples experience too
 
End of the day those fancy designers using all those hi-tech stuff like ipads and cut n paste and give artists impression, i still went for this "AH Beng" type contractor whom still used hand to draw on paper and quite impressive still    
 
p.s. i just had to change my mums cupboard hinges last year because they would not retract; simple DIY job which took me about 1/2 day to finish about 20 sets++

I did say unless they are really old furniture. Modern day cabinets, cupboards and even sofa no more solid wood. It's those multi-ply chipboards. Just walk around defu lane1. There are a lot of carpenters and tile distributors there. You will not see any solid wood. They do a lot of pre-fabrication there before the contractors collect them to do the finishing.

bro i am a little confused .... is plywood the same as multi ply chipboards???Different. In fact, plywood still stronger than chipboard. But depends who is the manufacturer. China plywood notorious for having air space inbetween the plies, so when you cut them open, you can see gaps.  
For customized carpentry, usually my experience is that they all use plywood instead of chipboard. But for most of ikea diy assemble yourself are using chipboard.
 
Mdf actually quite strong compared to chipboards.

Wall cabinets very difficult to use solid wood lah. Solid wood comes mainly in plank shape. Have to do strong bonding to stick many planks into a large piece.
 
Plywood by default can have fairly large and wide pieces so easy to use for cabinet construction. Plywood is formed by many thin slices of solid wood stick together. Each slice is cut continuously out from tree log like how you unwrap aluminium foil - so can form very large continuous pieces.

Agreed. My kitchen sink cabinet made of plywood gave way after 3 years, partly due to water ingress. The plywood is so soft and weak. 
Changed to Ikea cabinet, the compressed wood doors are so heavy, the laminate is well made, overall should be more durable than those plywood doors.

Best for kitchen sink area is to have raise concrete with alum doors. Then no issue with getting wet. This is best, esp for rental. Else install an open stainless steel sink. 
 
 
Use wood, even if it is solid wood, as long as it is wet, it will go in a matter of time. Good only when u are having a kitchen as a display.

Are you talking about the countertop right ?? If that is the item you can use the so called PVC type Corrian or even granite and I kept the base tiles exposed and the wood frame  structure can be seen when the doors are opened so that in case there is water seepage it can be seen easily as there are drainage pipes and this area is always somehow moist due to spillage over the silicon between the basin and countertop and gets smelly - I leave ithe doors open always overnight - I put some pandan leaves always so roaches / chichaks don't come in

Quality has dropped badly in all houses now, whether hdb or private!This is due to some greedy developers want to have big profits. 
Another type is use low quality materials cut cost to make the selling price looks "affordable" or cheaper compare to other projects.

if you want in the city area - try Kim Hup Lee 16 King Georges Avenue (opposite Song Lim Bldg and the blue mosque near  on Victoria Street/jalan Sultan ) , I see a lot of planks there last time , there was another one in Balestier Road near Khalsa Assn, but i think they closed down already)
 
But I dont know if they cut on the spot the size (if not carry a saw and cut on the spot ) unless you got a pick up/lorry or van
 
But you must check out the different types of wood suitable too;

Are you talking about the countertop right ?? If that is the item you can use the so called PVC type Corrian or even granite and I kept the base tiles exposed and the wood frame  structure can be seen when the doors are opened so that in case there is water seepage it can be seen easily as there are drainage pipes and this area is always somehow moist due to spillage over the silicon between the basin and countertop and gets smelly - I leave ithe doors open always overnight - I put some pandan leaves always so roaches / chichaks don't come inMy counter top was made of acrylic. But all counter tops will have a layer of plywood below. To make things worse, the sink was mounted from below, and not using proper bracket. Over time water leaked through the gap between the sink and the counter top. I had no say in the construction as it was fidone by the previous house owner. 
So when I changed to Ikea cabinet and counter top, decided to do top mount of the sink. Aesthetically not as nice, but more lasting and water tight. Very important as my mom cooks 2 meals a day in the kitchen.

There are various ways to "anchor" a piece of wood and the cabinet, to the wall.
Length, width, number of screws used, depth of hole, type of anchors, will determine if they have enough load-bearing.
 
If properly done, the cabinet will stay on the wall indefinitely.
If you scrimp on something, then it will fall off.

Agreed. My kitchen sink cabinet made of plywood gave way after 3 years, partly due to water ingress. The plywood is so soft and weak.
 
Changed to Ikea cabinet, the compressed wood doors are so heavy, the laminate is well made, overall should be more durable than those plywood doors.

 
Ya true.  Mine too was spoilt .  Wonder why they nvr use cement instead of plywood for the sink area. Our parents' time they use cement instead of plywood right?
 
I always tell my first timers friends who are renovating their house to make sure that their sink area are not made of wood. Make sure it is made with cement.

Now everything made in China.  Even the workers that "do" your renovation also china.
 
When I ask for replacement of my spoilt heater, I insisted that a Singaporean electrician.  If not later  kena electric shock and die.

sometimes i feel perturbed by the way hdb works.
 
when the land is released for bidding, the one who bid the highest gets the dough, this pushes up the house prices as the developer need to earn a princely amount of $.
why can't they choose the one with the lowest bidding?
collect money they will take the highest bid.
 
when choosing vendors for their contract services they will take the vendor with lowest tender amount.
what fxxk logic is this seriously?
 
they should wake up their ideas and start to accept bid lowest amount from the developer in order to keep competitive and affordable price for hdb peasants like us.

why is this a joke?
 
the gahment had regulatory body like BCA..others(whatever they called it.i am not in construction line) to check for developers cutting corners or using inferiors materials not passable for construction for the integrity of the building.
the developer submitted the lowest bid for the land should have done their calculations for labours/materials/logistics/others..
 
so when collecting money,the one who bid the highest surely is the most topnotch quality?
 
and how do you explain why they choose supplier with the lowest bid for contracting their services then?does that means the supplier with the lowest bid is the lousiest also?
 
so when paying money,the one who tender the lowest is the most topnotch quality as well?
 
i am perturbed if their logic is above.

If govt takes the lowest bid for land, then won't every developer bid 0 dollars? So just do lucky draw to give them free land?

Can i bid $1 for a GCB?
 

I don't understand what this has got to do with the bidding of land issue.
 
If a developer wants to be known to make quality developments like City development, then the impetus is on them to not squeeze their main contractor/subcon too much and yet demand high standards from them.
