Some interesting FACT. What does it mean?
 

PR own HDB equivalent to 2 Bukit Panjang or Pasir Ris town... That WHY so crowded!!!!!!  
 
 
 

As at 30 Jun 2009, there were about 533,000 PRs in Singapore, making up 14.3% of Singapore's total resident population. PR households own a total of 42,800 HDB flats as at 30 Jun 2009.  This constitutes slightly under 5% (4.9%) of all HDB households. PR households are found in all HDB towns/estates.  
 

HDB has increased the BTO supply to 5,000 flats in the last quarter of this year. If we include the recent Sale of Balance Flats (Oct 09), HDB will offer over 7,000 flats in 3 months, and a total of 13,500 flats in 2009. This is about half the number of flats in Bukit Panjang or Pasir Ris town.  At this rate, HDB would have offered enough flats to fill another Bukit Panjang or Pasir Ris in just two years.

It is time to stop this stifling influx of PRs/FTs.  They are driving up the cost of HDB flats and with it higher property tax.  It's so crowded everywhere.  SGPs must wake up to this prob before it becomes irreversible.

My place is filled with lot of indian PR.During afternoon and evening time can see lots of their mom and kids gather around the playground. Although HDB control the max number of race allocated for each blk of flat ownership, they did not control the type of race that allowed to be rental out. Since there is a indian temple just accross  the road, within this 2 years, my area become flooded with all the indian PR here. Soon it may become the next mini little india street

I believe the current HDB racial quota is one that specifies the minimum number of minority races and not a max.

do you think government is crazy to stop the influx?  Those PR are the most generous customer of HDB flats... paying top range prices without batting a eyelid. Which indirectly leads to higher prices for new flats.
 
 

I'm not saying anything without facts.... i personally know of a few PR friends paying crazy prices even at ulu places. to them, the price range is "normal"

anyway they will be going back to their own country for retirement living on HDB rental income. at least that is the plan for now

Nothing new here, temporary solutions such as 'Stop at Two' policy and now that leads to our own version of globalisation. Singapore is now a global village - playing host to all foreigners, and soon we will be serving them.

Sounds right!   or at least a levy since our garmen so money face. Say about S$100,000 sound right. We pay levy for maids and workers, so make them pay levy for buying up what is a citizen's priviledge - low cost housing.

Yes absolutely, we are now facing the backlash of this 'Stop at Two' policy'. 

It's is to fill in the void of the X Generation had this poicy didn't come into effect.  

To correct the wrongs of policies implemented around 40 years ago.........

which created more problem......but mainly confine to social issues, economic issues not really sure yet.

Unless the property bubble is some what related?

PRs are not stupid. Why rent?  when you can buy & maybe sell later at a profit? somemore can rent out the extra rooms.
 

They are unlike S'porean, where maybe only one family stay in one flat...we wanted lifestyle?
 

Look around, I think most PR owned flat has at least two families living inside, plus ah gong & ah ma. I believe they rented out the other rooms, lightening their house instalment. yes, their flats are always crowded and smelly.
 

Is a smart choice to buy flats, hence boomz the GDP.
 

PRs are cash cows, we must not scarced them away. Let them settle here and bleed together with us. 
 

Yes. the force is with us.
 

and oh, we need to go ICT to protect them.

Maybe you should go and question HDB instead on what is the rational and why they are controlling the # of race in a blk.
 

For me, i pefer to stay is Chinatown rather than in little India. You can go and ask the rest of the chinese PR who stay in chinatown or indian PR who stay in little india on whether they prefer to stay with their own community or different community.

I disagree. I feel that only HDB should be allowed to rent out entire units. 
 

This will deter people from buying HDB flats unnecessarily thus raising the costs. People should only be allowed to rent rooms up to a maximum of the total number of bedrooms minus one If someone wants to rent an entire unit, they will have to  rent private, and if they can't afford private, it should be up to the HDB to rent subsidised units to them directly.
 

The cost of each new flat should be pegged to the actual cost price + a fixed percentage, and PR's of less than 2 years (unless there's a singaporean co-owner) should be levied with an additional surcharge. Resale flats should similarly be pegged to the cost of a new flat (if it was torn down and rebuilt) and the new owner should be charged the pro-rated estimated cost price + a fixed percentage with the same conditions although flats over 10 years of age should be exempt from the 2yr PR rule.
 

To make things a little more equitable, on a nationwide scale, different percentages could be charged on top of the prevailing rates to to flats of different distances from the CBD and the Orchard Rd shopping belt, while on a more local scale a fixed surcharge could be levied onto flats within a small area that is say 2km of an MRT station or a bus interchnage.

Errm the race quota max generally applies to the chinese. The rest of the quota is to ensure minimum amounts of minorities are there to annoy people like you. Since I'm classified as "others" IIRC I can get away with more than any of the chinese, indians, malays or eurasians MUAHAHAHAHAHHAAH  
 

P.S. Are there still HDB flats in chinatown????

Yep. The only problem is that their HDB will lose $200,000,000,000 instead of $2,000,000,000.
 

And GDP will fall... as will someone's salary... and we won't attract the best... and heads will roll... and we will live in slums... and become maids in other people's country... and there you see.

MUAHAHAHHA  
 

We all know how they calculated their "loss" which was "market rate" vs rate paid after subsidy without taking into account that the subsidy was paid from non-HDB govt coffers   [laugh] 
 

If the govt really wants to earn money to compensate, they should raise taxes by 2% and have three additional tax brackets. One for poeple who earn over $120000k a year (20%), one for people who earn over $250000 a year (25%) and one for people who earn over $500000 a year (30%). Afterwhich they should also slap a 30% luxury tax on vehicles who's OMV is more than $40k.While they're at it they should slap another 20% on fuel as an environmental tax. Oh wait... I forgot... our Ministers would be in the top two tax brackets and they would be earning less, have to settle for cheaper cars, and would have to drive less (since they don't take public transport)

 Awww..c'mon...you should try to sound intelligent when you wanna say something...
 

The racial mix quota is to ensure a minimum of other races...its meant to ensure some kind of integration...please dun make it sound like the gahmen's policy is aimed at segregating people...because the only one who's shown his true colours here (pun intended)...is you....
 

Now..my queston again...do you have a problem with the other races who seem to be moving into your neighbourhood?  And if so, why do you have a problem with them?  Notice, that in your own comments, you stated that Chinese stay in Chinatown and Indians in Little india...You are a Chinese, do you stay in Chinatown?  Are you advocating a policy whereby each race should take up one corner (or segment) of Singapore?
 

I'm only asking cos you brought race into the discusion first...noticed that the other Bros, even TS only mentioned PRs, not race..so it seems you have a bone against other races...

PRs are getting smarter too.

Even though they can afford private housing, they will still go for HDB house for convenience sake.
 

In order to make HDB a privilage for locals, maybe they can start imposing levy.

Maybe 30% of open market value. 

In a way, they will not dare to offer higher price for hdb and after sometimes, when owners see no buyer, they will also dun dare to sell high.
 

And even for those PRs who convert to local citizen ship, should not be able to enjoy all of the benefits which locals have maybe only up to 90%.

Things such as housing loan must go thru bank and not hdb, medical benefits reduced, education benefits.
 

If they choose SG to stay due to the peaceful life away from natural disaster, better education and better standard of leaving, they will need to pay the price.
 

And even for WDA who sponsers part of course fee for companies, should only do so for pure singaporeans.

This will encourage the company to employ more locals.

You do know that it is BS that just because PRs cannot buy new flats does not mean squat, right?
 

Just look at how new flats are priced. Mkt price less 40k grant. So even if PRs cannot buy new flats, who says they are not competing with you for new flats? By pushing up resale flat prices around the island, ultimately, new flat prices will also follow suit.

Doubt the govt will ever depress the price. Alot of singaporeans will die if they ever try to bring the prices down.  PRs and FTs are a must to push the rental mkrt up and hence the price. Rather than seeing how you will lose to the high price.. better to see how you can gain out of it. At the flat where I am staying.. slightly less than 1/3 of the level are rented out.. and the occupants shift to stay with their children.. Extra income of 1.6k per mth is a lot for the household... It is bad for me cos i get the place at high price but it is damn good for the older generations..

Actually, the quota rule also makes it easier for control.
 

It makes representation for the minority much more difficult.
 

United we stand, divided we fall. Sounds familiar?
 

If you ever had a bunch of problematic fellows to manage, you will always find it easier to disperse them and handle them separately. Be it for good or bad, it keeps things simpler.
