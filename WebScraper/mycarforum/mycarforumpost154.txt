Yahoo news: HDB flat in Bishan sold for a record $1.05 million
 
A HDB executive maisonette in Bishan Street 13 was sold for a record S$1.05 million in December with cash-over-valuation of S$250,000, according to market data.Located on the 20th floor of Block 190, the 150 sq m (approx. 1,615 sq ft) flat was listed on real estate portal PropertyGuru for about one month and attracted keen interest from three other buyers willing to pay over S$1.05 million, said DWG agent Thomas Hee who closed the deal.But in the end it was sold to a young couple very familiar with the market.Hee believes that the demand for HDB resale flats in Bishan is strong due to a number of factors such as its strategic location in the centre of the island, the presence of reputable schools in the area, an abundance of spacious units which are a rarity in the central region and the fact that the estate is well-maintained."Bishan is one of the best, if not the best maintained estate in Singapore and this is reflected by what many prospective buyers have told me."



Yahoo Newsroom Videos/Google Maps - A Bishan maisonette on Bishan Street 13 is sold for S$1.05 million.



When asked why such buyers would not look at the executive condominium (EC) market or mass market condominiums which offered comparable prices and come with facilities, Hee said: "ECs and condos do not have such a size and such a good location. They also have higher maintenance fees to service. Bishan is still the most favoured estate in Singapore and despite the cooling measures, there are still cash-rich buyers telling me that price isn't a problem for them and to just get them 'good' houses."

Already said in the other thread, if this type of maisonette can fetch $1.05 million, I wonder that the penthouse maisonettes at blk 286 can fetch.
 
Only the top two floor units are maisonettes (23rd and 24th floor), all lower floors are 4-room units. Last transaction was July 2010, at 900k.

Located on the 20th floor of Block 190, the 150 sq m (approx. 1,615 sq ft) flat was listed on real estate portal PropertyGuru for about one month and attracted keen interest from three other buyers willing to pay over S$1.05 million, said DWG agent Thomas Hee who closed the deal.
 
But in the end it was sold to a young couple very familiar with the market.
 
 
 

 
So the agent / seller don't believe in highest price theory?
3 potential buyer willing to pay over $1.05 million, but finally sold "only " at $1.05 million?

Not really that bad la. Its only the road leading to Junction 8 that is really bad. For this block that was just sold, the carpark just changed to EPS and the entrance is near SJI that side. Not much traffic there except in the morning around 7am.

The population demographics of Bishan may have played a part in the general feel of the estate.
 
There are many well-educated local Chinese families who live there, can see from just hanging around and observing at Junction 8 and the coffeeshops in the area.  Not many old people, unlike Toa Payoh and Ang Mo Kio.  Most people can speak pretty ok English and many English-speaking Chinese families.  Dressing-wise, the aunties dress differently from the super lok kok Ah Sohs in other estates.  A bit hiao one.  Rarely see any skinny, unwashed uncles shuffling around.  Shows that people in Bishan are above average in affluence.  Not atas, but just naturally so.  Not many void deck guitar-playing or loud motorcycle revving at void decks also.
 
And if you notice, Bishan may be the only HDB estate with more FT PMET than FW.  I guess that itself accounts for the cleanliness of the estate.  I hardly see any FW in Bishan, whenever I go there to makan or CPF office.
 
I like Bishan.  It would be the HDB estate I would live in.  Bishan should be the model for other estates to aspire to.

Hopefully it remains that way. Recently a few units in my blocks were sold and now there are many FTs living in those units. Dunno if they are the ones that buy or rent. Many from Myanmar and some other Asian country. Definitely not local but I didn't know what language they were speaking.

I kind of like ShunFu too. Can walk to upper thomson eateries, can take MRT just beside, can walk to McRitchie, got RI and RJC beside and heck, even got a SCDF station in front in case of any emergencies!
 
The only thing I dislike is the number of humps. It's like they use Shunfu for hump making exercises.

Guess different people like different estates. Have been staying at my parents flat in Bishan for so many years so decided to get a flat in Bishan also. MRT also 5 min away. Found Bishan more convenient than TPY or AMK cuz Bishan MRT can go to circle line or NS line without changing trains. Plus my son is going to a Primary school in Bishan so this will be more convenient for me as well once he enters Primary school.
 
But both also equally expensive.

Morning, no jam when gg to work at town/CBD.
 
Evening come back also less jam.

 
You staying west side too? Definitely less jams going to work in the morning (as long as you're not heading further west, e.g. to Tuas) and less jams going home in the evening.
 
Whether PIE or other expressway, always see the opposite direction jammed up  Even the recently opened MCE was no issue at all, and I wondered what jam people were talking about??
 
Still people don't seem to appreciate the west side properties.
 
North and north east side are the worst in terms of traffic flow, only served by one main road or expressway going in and out! Yet many people flocking there, e.g. punggol and sengkang. Wonder why?

Already said in the other thread, if this type of maisonette can fetch $1.05 million, I wonder that the penthouse maisonettes at blk 286 can fetch.
 
Only the top two floor units are maisonettes (23rd and 24th floor), all lower floors are 4-room units. Last transaction was July 2010, at 900k.

 
This kind of mixed hdb is not very friendly to the 'atas' people.
The maisonette owners are usually white collar. 4 room ones are normally blue collar.

This kind of mixed hdb is not very friendly to the 'atas' people.
The maisonette owners are usually white collar. 4 room ones are normally blue collar.

You will be amazed that some HDB carparks have Porsche 911/Mercedes SLS AMG/ BMW M6/ Masarati parked in plenty...and yes they are residents (most of their cars cost more than the house ??!1!)

HDB - Subsidized Maintenance Fee / Gas / Water / Electricity / Property Tax (I think so) / etc...
 
Private Apartment - Not Subsidized for the above.
 
So I should buy a HDB in Bishan & join SICC for the facilities & proximity from my home …

I'm just saying, people fail to highlight the good in a HDB, which is the lower maintenance... 
 
And why are you up so early, I thought you collect CPF money can sleep till noon everyday...

Not every unit offering good view, price diff can be huge within same block or even same stack.
Buyer might have well verse in ppty, if u have view the unit n compare with the rest u will know why ppl willing pay this kind of money. Is not only about having facilities n subsidies, more on practicality, amenities n layout sizes are normally the main consideration.

the flat is 20 years old ... stay for another 15 years = 35 years
by that time, hdb probably want to re-develop the block already
will hdb compensate $1.05M for a 35 years old unit?

Pinnacle@Duxton may create many $1mil HDB once it reach MOP.
By then $1mil HDB could be a norm, be it the lease is 60years left, over there PC can hit $3k psf.

White collar and blue collar can also be friends and talk about their children or hobbies mah.. Not just about work.. Else accountant and analyst have nothing much to talk about too..
 
You will be amazed that some HDB carparks have Porsche 911/Mercedes SLS AMG/ BMW M6/ Masarati parked in plenty...and yes they are residents (most of their cars cost more than the house ??!1!)
 
So far, the most expensive vehicles I saw around HDB are Lotus Elise, BMW Z4, and S350 (not sure if visiting or resident, coz see often, but not always)..
 
Sometime win toto all those leh? Never know also.. Or those invest in Blumont at 5cents and sold at $2++..
 
Then again, to count for the couple who bought the Bishan mansionette, if never buy car, they will save a lot in the long run too.. It's near town, so short commute to most places, don't need buy car, so save about 15K - 20K a year, over a working life of about 30 years, that's 450 - 600K, which is about half the value of their house.

The population demographics of Bishan may have played a part in the general feel of the estate.
 
There are many well-educated local Chinese families who live there, can see from just hanging around and observing at Junction 8 and the coffeeshops in the area.  Not many old people, unlike Toa Payoh and Ang Mo Kio.  Most people can speak pretty ok English and many English-speaking Chinese families.  Dressing-wise, the aunties dress differently from the super lok kok Ah Sohs in other estates.  A bit hiao one.  Rarely see any skinny, unwashed uncles shuffling around.  Shows that people in Bishan are above average in affluence.  Not atas, but just naturally so.  Not many void deck guitar-playing or loud motorcycle revving at void decks also.
 
And if you notice, Bishan may be the only HDB estate with more FT PMET than FW.  I guess that itself accounts for the cleanliness of the estate.  I hardly see any FW in Bishan, whenever I go there to makan or CPF office.
 
I like Bishan.  It would be the HDB estate I would live in.  Bishan should be the model for other estates to aspire to.

So I should buy a HDB in Bishan & join SICC for the facilities & proximity from my home …  

 
That's a great idea! LOL
 
BTW, there are quite a number of Toyota Altis, Honda Accord, Toyota Wish, Harrier, Nissan Cefiro/Teana, that kind of affordable uncle car with HDB parking disc right next to the SICC and TMCC parking discs.

True elites have never even stepped into an HDB estate!  Much less write a post extoling the virtues of an HDB estate!

Guess different people like different estates. Have been staying at my parents flat in Bishan for so many years so decided to get a flat in Bishan also. MRT also 5 min away. Found Bishan more convenient than TPY or AMK cuz Bishan MRT can go to circle line or NS line without changing trains. Plus my son is going to a Primary school in Bishan so this will be more convenient for me as well once he enters Primary school.
 
But both also equally expensive.

Makes perfect sense.
 
Good for you!

Bishan EC already hit 10yrs and record shows a unit sold at $1227psf and another unit sold at $1.65mil recently.
To some buyers an EC is still clasified as an EC, yet these prices are still very high to many of us here in Sg.
With the current land bidding are still going strong, the future ppty mkt is either developers are losing money or only the rich can affort those exclusive HDB and EC. Poor ppl couldn't affort will not touch them.
This Bishan HDB was transacted in Dec 13 could means it's done deal way before some of the cooling measure get kicks in.
Dec data showed only 74 EC units sold and that's already tell us that MSR and levy on 2nd timer which kick in last month does has an impact to the market.

why never step into HDB estates before?
 
those meeting the people and giving out NTUC fairprice vouchers every week are not true elites?  
 
the occasional bentley or lambo parked in a HDB MSCP not true elites?

Bishan is like sanitised sg.
To ensure proper balance, govt must build one-room, 3-room rental units and FW dorms there.

I've been to Bishan quite a few times in my life.  Still gave me a 100% heartland feeling.
 
Nothing wrong with that, i clarify.
I too live in the heartlands.
