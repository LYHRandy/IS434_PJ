Edit: Just saw your reply. 
 

Not sure about private, but would think that it would encompass forfeiture of the 5% downpayment fee/option fee(possibly can recoup some back) + legal fees + bank loan(if any). cancellation admin fees and opportunity costs if you have signed anything with a bank.
 

What did your agent tell you?

Have you worked out other available options? Is this your 2nd property? What a waste it would be, especially if you have bought it before the ABSD kicks in on the 11th Jan 2013.

Errr ... it really depends on the other side. My Sister pulled out and lost her deposit but I think it was only for 1%. I heard the agent and the owner split 50/50.

1% is OTP is gone if you pull out after owner accepted. TS is talking about 5% now! it is 1.25% that would be gone!

if option already exercised, i think your position is quite vulnerable.
 

the seller can come back to sue you for the price differential if his next buyer buys at a lower price.
 

in the eye of IRAS, you have already paid the stamp duty and this transaction is legally recognise, title to be transferred.

Not good my friend.

I have given up exercising an option for 1% before for a better deal but this is deeper than that, you shouldnt be backing out at this stage. 
 

Honestly, under normal instances i will sue the buyer for serious compensation if i were the seller....

Not sure how nice, the seller is in your case.

By pulling out of the deal after you've exercised the OTP,
 

1) The seller can sue you for the price difference if he has to subsequently sell his property at a lower price.

2) You could be liable to pay for the commission for the seller's agent as well as your agent since legally, it was already a done deal and they are entitled to their dues.

i am recalling my knowlege gained during my study of contract law.
 

court will typically allow 2 types of restitution
 

1) specific performance

2) damages
 

If seller prefer 1, he can immediately (upon expiry of the window period stated in the option contract to complete the purchase and payment) get his lawyer to apply for court to enforce buyer take delivery of the unit and pay up.
 

However, in all practicality, most sellers will adopt 2.  easier to execute and enforce.  and where damages is concerned, the principle is always the price differential.  to adopt option 2), it make sense only to start legal action once buyer have been identified.  otherwise if the buyer pays commits to pay price above what the previous buyer defaulted on, there is no need to commence legal action.

in principle yes but beware that assignment of sale contract and option is not straight forward and seller may want to make things more difficult for buyer so that he perhaps earn the extra option monies from the buyer's default.

you're definitely in deep doo doo as some of the bros have said. the 1% is for you to think, the 5% is for you to see the deal through. once you confirm, the seller has several legal rights against you and no amount of excuses will really help at this junction. even letting someone take over the purchase will be tough, as the person taking over may "squeeze" the life out of you to save you, since he knows you are vulnerable.
 

remember - if you delay completion, you will definitely be liable for interest past completion. also, after exercise ... seller can force you to complete as the document is legally binding.
 

i think assignment in this case *may* have ABSD ... if you just exercise today, means you would not have paid stamp duty yet (i normally never pay immediately). im sure you dont want to kena the whatever % ABSD also. please check with the taxman on this ...
 

you are at the seller's mercy now, i suggest you explain why you have changed your mind and hope he can assist you bro. otherwise legally, you have zero rights.

You buy new from developer or buy resale fr0m a seller?
 

if from a seller, I think most forumers have given you their thoughts.
 

if bought from developer, I would say zero chance to back-out now unless you can find another buyer to take over, then maybe can still negotiate.
 

Bank loan side may also have cancellation penalty.

i always wonder at property launch how do one make decision to purchase a $1M+ property in less than 30mins and hard selling by agent that unit is going fast and every minute got someone update the sold chart

some may argue the person had done his homework but when you went to see the showroom ... that might change your perception abit right

type A or type B layout ... wider or longer balcony ... with/without bathtub ... 2+S or compact 3 ... facing hdb or greenery

seeing the showroom is difference from reading the brochure and floorplan

i think u have gotten your ans from all the bros here...
 

by exercising the option, you have agreed to buy the property and you are both liable and obligated to complete the transaction from that point on.
 

So unless the seller is so kind (very low possibility), you probably lan lan somehow must find a way to complete the transaction. That will be the cheapest way out of the situation. Then just rent out or what not and tahan till SSD period is up, then dispose the pty depending on the situation then.

The Southeast Asian city-state of Singapore may boast of the highest percentage of millionaires in the world, but retiring in this wealthy financial hub is becoming even more difficult for the common man.
 
 

According to a latest study by HSBC, the citizens of this country, which has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, face the grim prospect of running out of their savings almost halfway through retirement as the high cost of living and increased life expectancy eats into their nest egg.
 
 

Singapore has gradually moved up human resources firm Mercer's global rankings of the world's most expensive cities, moving to sixth place in 2012 from eighth in 2011 and eleventh in 2010.
 
 

(Read more: Singapore's High Cost of Living May Come at a Cost)
 

"There is cause for concern from the finding that the retirement savings of people in Singapore will run out after nine years, which is about the time they are entering into frail retirement and a stage of their lives when medical costs and other elderly care expenses are expected to rise," Paul Arrowsmith, head of retail banking and wealth management, HSBC Singapore, said in the report released on Wednesday.
 
 

"People are living longer, through tougher economic times, and expectations about their standard of living in retirement have risen," Arrowsmith added.
 
 

More than half of the 1,000 Singaporeans interviewed for the survey said that either they were not adequately prepared or not prepared at all for retirement as they expected to continue working beyond the age of 65 to be able to afford their desired lifestyle.
 
 

One also needs more money to fund one's retirement in Singapore. According to the study, the annual household income required to lead a "comfortable" retired life in Singapore is the third highest among Asia's major economies, behind Australia and Hong Kong, at $48,773. This figure is 68 percent higher than what was needed in 2011, the survey, which has been running for eight years, found.
 
 

The rising cost of living in Singapore has 58-year-old Singaporean Janice Tan worried about her retirement.
 
 

"I think the cost of living is really escalating a lot," Tan told CNBC. "During the Chinese New Year season, when I went to buy the goodies, it really shocked me, because the cost is really going up too fast."
 

Bloomberg | Getty Images Tan and her husband are currently paying for the education of their two children, including a 21-year-old daughter studying in Perth, Australia. While Tan, an administration professional, hopes to retire soon, she says she knows it might be another 10 years before that happens.
 
 

"As human beings we want more - a more comfortable life. That's where the worries come in on whether you will able to survive," Tan said.
 
 

According to the study, of those not saving for retirement, nearly half said they were being held back by the cost of day-to-day living.
 
 

(Read more: Protest Puts Political Risk in Singapore's Future) 
 
 

High costs have become a major cause of discontent among Singapore's residents. This prompted a rare protest over the weekend in which about 3,000 people participated. They were voicing concerns over swelling costs driven by an influx of foreigners.
 
 

Foreigners, who account for almost 40 percent of Singapore's 5.3 million people, have been blamed for pushing up housing pricesand taking up jobs in one of Asia's major business centers.
 
 

(Read more: Singapore Firms Hit by Foreign Labor Laws)
 

Retirement Fears
 
 

The top three fears about retirement cited by Singaporeans were poor health, financial hardship and not having enough money to provide for good healthcare, according to the study.
 
 

With retirement savings drying up at a time when Singaporeans are most vulnerable to health problems, funding medical bills could become a big burden, HSBC said. 
 
 

Tan backed that sentiment, saying that medical bills from a motorcycle accident that her husband was involved in last year have been a drain on their finances.
 
 

"As we get older, I realize it [funding health costs] is a more important thing to sort out," said Tan. But the high cost of living is coming in the way. "I can't imagine how much more the cost of living is going to go up to," she added.

I agree .... I was at the launch of Trevista in TP. It was crazy and people are like rushing in to put their money in. So many people in the showroom and the place was like a wet market. I told my agent that is not the way to buy a home. I just walked off ....
 

Buyers should not be pressured by the Agents/Sellers ..... take your time, do your sum, think hard before making a decision. The buyer for my previous apartment was made to pay penalty for late completion. Some agents are only interested in their commission .....
 

Anyway for TS, tough luck, you have exercised the option and legally there is noway out. Your destiny is in the hand of the seller and you have to lose more than the 5%. If I am not wrong, the seller can sue you.

I have an uncle who bought a merc with number 1442. People said what a lousy number. The number means "died hungry, and died number". But he interpret as "want to die, you die". And he is doing very we'll in his business both before and after he bought the car.
 

174, can be interpret as "he go and die".

2nd that... Cos I sue someone over that before  




The buyer of my fren's property backed out due to loan rejection, my fren kind hearted, only asked for a nominal compensation but sold it to another buyer who actually offered much more than the original price as the market was in a big up swing......  But fren is still kind and took pity of first buyer's wrong move in being over confident in his bank loan approval.  Quite a rare case for buyer to escape full forfeiture.

thank you all for replying. I decided to go ahead. Reason is due to fengshui. My dad was so angry with the house number. We managed to convince him.




fengshui has nothing to do with house number.

so funny... why you even consider forfeiting .. say 5% of 2mil = 100k and possible legal complication just because of the house number ? 
 

if your father dun want to visit.. you can jolly can rent it out, until 4 yrs later than sell it off loh.. afterall, now the market is still trending upwards.. you may make afterall.

yi jing is a divination tool.  it is merely used to forecast what will happen.  that is to say, it is only a messenger.
 

when someone tells you a bad news, do you get angry at the messenger or the actual development giving rise to the news?
 

if yi jing predicts it is bad luck, it merely means that the person will still have bad luck even if he don't buy the house.

how could a house number determine by any tom dick & harry developer or SLA affect the fengshui?  if there is a redevelopment, URA took over and number it as 138, wow.... like that mean FS will change?
 

ok if the number is pantang number, let it have 0.01% possibility to affect the FS

Man renovates wrong house 

A man spent about S$37,836 to renovate his new house only to discover, after all the works had been completed, that he had renovated the wrong house, Sin Chew Daily reported.
 

Gui Li Zong and his family, who were celebrating Chinese New Year in the house, were shocked when the actual owner of the house showed up in Chongqing, China.
 

"Why are you staying here? I bought this house in 2011," the owner told Gui.
 

The owner even showed Gui the contract. Only then did Gui realise he had renovated the wrong house.
 

"I viewed the house twice before I signed the contract.
 

"The property agent showed me this particular unit," Gui said, adding that he only put up the house number after the renovation work had been completed.
 

Gui then checked with the agent but the person-in-charge denied that she had showed Gui the wrong unit.
 

The home owner also refused to exchange his house for Gui's unit.

haha to be fair, there is 0.01% it will affet the fengshui.  when a pantang number is there, and the owner/occupied become paranoid and allows it to affect their outlook and behave negatively, then the fengshui is affected becase it becomes a self-fulfulling prophecy.

there are many parts to yi jing and it has evolved somehow...but i understand it has been used in recent years to determine the effect on how it would have an effect on a person... the combi of the numbers is thus impt to certain extend on the energy that is required to support the person...of cos that been said, it does not guarantee success.. it jus enhance the goodness..

There's been so much talk (and hype) about the Government's recently released Population White Paper and Land Use Plan to support up to a 6.9 million population in 2030, but I think at the end of the day most people are still confused about one key question - is the long term growth plan for Singapore's population and the related land use plans good or bad for property prices? 
 

A quick recap of the population growth plan

Singapore had 3.29 million citizens and 0.53 million Permanent Residents (PRs) as at June 2012, which together make up the resident population. We also had a non-resident population (including domestic workers, foreign talent, students etc) of 1.49 million, giving a total population of 5.31 million.

let's put it this way - i am saying all this because i am deeply into this industry as well.  there are many conman, quacks or unethical practitioners in this trade.
 

these are the people that tell you that yijing has evolved and it can do much more nowadays, mainly because they want to attract you to engage their service or teaching.  but if you analyse deeper, they are still using the theories passed down from ancient times so how has the passage of time allow it to use old theory to do new things?
 

of course some practitioenrs have come up with their own research and practice married into more contemporary customs.  but that is more like modifying the application to stay relevant with current societial customs and not something evolutionary.  even if one or two practitioner claimed they achieve a breakthrough, i still have a doubt about their claims and it remains not verifiable.

it is verifiable only to limited degree and i have blogged about this before.
 

the disadvantage in this industry is that it is not possible to do scientific verification or experiment because its outcome is based on humans and each human is unique and behavior differing from one day to another.  in scientific experiement, it is straightforward because most of the object being measured are not living things.  even in cases whereby experiment is done on living animal, it is still under controlled environment (mice are only allow certain room to move around etc) and therefore the analysis out of the results of experiment is meaningful.
 

but a good researcher in this field will do as much to keep the environment and parameters consistent as they vary the fengshui variables to see its effect. if this is done and the effect is dramatic, it therefore strongly suggests a trend.  if the effect is only marginal, a good researcher and statistician will knwo it better be classify as no meaningful correlation.  ie better to err on the side of caution in the latter case.

Dear property gurus... haha....  dunno where to post as too mant property threads.... 
 

Need a little views... 
 

Change of plans.... gf (wife to be) prefer to have a place of our own.... So we're starting to look for our matrimonial home,  not gonna stay with parents afterall.   

Can I have your opinions regarding the 2 developments?
 

Cube 8

http://www.cdl.com.sg/cube8/
 

VS 
 

Alexis

http://condo.singaporeexpats.com/condo/3044/ALEXIS
 
 

My comfortable budget is 1.5 mil. Can go up to 1.6 mil but preferably not more than that.
 

Preferences

- City Fringe ( D11 end, D12, D8, D3)

- Convenience as gf doesn't drive. thus MRT and bus stop networks are important
 

Considerations

- Resale potential

- Rental potential
 

As plans in the near future may include shifting back to stay with parents after future wifey give birth, or might wanna get a 2nd property and rent this out as side income.... 
 

Thanks thanks to all......... 
 

cheers

hey bro .. just some numbers for you (transactions for 2013):
 

Cube 8:
 


 

Alexis:
 


 

personally, if you can get from developer and the project hasnt TOP, you can squeeze them on price (though choice units may be gone) and you'll get warranty (and maybe some other freebies thrown in)
 

however, i always have a soft spot for projects located close to town ;)

The best is you can get the property straight from developer without any agent involved, then you can squeeze more from them.
 

Because if you go straight to developer, they don't have to pay the agent commission so they are more willing to give u extra"discount"

used to drive past cube 8 daily for work.
 

very bad traffic in the morning. your main gate is at thomson road? getting out of the compound will likely take time.

try not to get the western facing unit. visited the arte before (western facing) in the afternoon. damn hot and glaring. but the view of the PA and polo club nice though.

near PIE. you can tahan the constant drone of traffic and the occasional hi speed bike screeching sound, esp at night?

evening traffic from novena towards upper thomson quite bad between 6 to 7pm.
 

good things:

got good makan along balestier rd

can walk to novena mrt if you want. 3 bus stops
 

If I want to buy, I would choose alexis (but not sure if rumbling of mrt track can be heard).

Ya, the Thomson road traffic is bad... I haven't view Cube 8 yet, planning to do so on Sat. Alexis is 0.34 km away from Queenstown so location is really convenient, plus Dawson place is just behind.... noise, gotta monitor.....

if you are interested in the balestier area, consider the developments at novena area (around united sq). think rental potential there buay pai.
 

or if you really like balestier, there is this development (prob 2 yrs old) behind boon tiong kee. very tall white building called Pavillion II. at junction of minbu road and akyab road. very swee from the outside. quiet surrounding. but getting to novena mrt might be an issue. not sure if walk to TPY mrt might be better.
 

there are also some new developments at boon teck road which is off balestier road (closer towards the end of thomson medical). quiet side street. but small plot of land and on 1st and 15th day of the Chinese calendar, might have some traffic issues as there is a chinese temple on that street. if you have a pet, then good as the vet is on the same street.

Unfortunately your budget is only $1.5mil, icebrush.

My take is to go for an older bigger place but better location.
 

cube 8 is by the PIE and essentially balestier.

Good thing it is at the edge.  

Developers preer to associate it with thomson or novena for reasons which we all know.

At least it is a proper condo.

$1350psf ok lah.
 

Alexis is small and mostly pigeon holes.

Very near the road and not to be considered a condo in my eyes.

Location is nearer to town so maybe thats an advantage.

I almost bought the 850sft "penthouse" at launch.

Lucky i bought somthing else.

$1350psf ok lah.
 
 

Good luck.  Rmemeber what you are buying it for and stick to that as your most important factors.

Dont let idiots sway you.  Including me.

Some developers don't let agents sell their properties, instead they do direct marketing, like Far East and Fraser. They give quite good discounts at projects like Seastrand!

soon to be not bachelor leow 

kids ... probably 1 year later



 

Think we kinda in the same situation bro... keke. But I'm taking it a step at a time. Getting married is fine. I'm actually pretty choosy but this time round, she's the right one who meets most of my criteria. (can't say all, nobody's perfect).
 

However.... parenthood... I'm absolutely not ready yet!! lol

good move to push PR to take up citizenship 
 


Separately, Singapore permanent resident households with no citizen owner will have to wait three years from the date of obtaining PR status before they can buy a resale HDB flat.

precisely. They have their own sales AGENTS to do it. Other developers don't hire agents and pay them regular salary unlike Far East. So they contract to certain agencies on commission basis to do it. Maybe u meant telling consumers to go to the developer's secretary or clerk to take orders? That'll be one hell of an overworked staff.

hey guys i'm jumping into this thread to get your views on property....
 
I'm happily married, stay in 5 room, spacious old hdb.
The best things  I like are the unobstructed view, as we face a lake, and the loan is fully repaid 
Wife not working and looking after our kids.
 
Recently I got itchy backside, and realising I could still qualify for EC (barely), I went to look at the new EC launches.
 
I was surprised at a few things....
 
1) The crowd flocking there like its something given out FOC
2) The price .... $750/psf and above, meaning $1m and above for 4 bedrooms...  
3) The proximity of the apartments, mostly facing inwards towards the pool, and each other, with full floor to ceiling glass walls (no more looking out to the horizon, just your neighbours' hall and bedroom). Even the ones facing exterior are facing future developments, and no guarantee of open views.
 
I almost, almost bought one unit on impulse, ready to give my cheque, but excused myself for a breather..... and drove straight home... *phew*
 
If you have a good, rare though old hdb unit, would you sell it and upgrade to EC with no view, stuck in it for at least 8 years (3 years to TOP + 5 years minimum occupation period before you can sell) and get into debt again   (probably for half a mil after selling off HDB)
 
Or would you hold on to your hdb, buy a pte condo when the market dips (with additional 7% Additional Buyer Stamp Duty for 2nd property, retain half of cpf minimum sum in OA etc etc) and rent out your hdb. As its pte condo, easier to sell off, and move back to my hdb should I wish.
 
I'm worried about debt as for sure interest rates will be back at a high by 2016 (i'm in finance related job)...... think lots of people will be in trouble at this point, especially EC dwellers.... imagine buying a $1m property when your combined income is below $12k. I strongly believe property price correction is due then...
 
Also, people keep saying buying an EC is an investment, but is that so?
It depends on which cycle you're at, and this is one helluva peak.
 
And I will miss the heavenly feeling of being debt free :(

EC 3-room close to $1M ($800k-ish?)
EC 4-room exceed $1M
EC penthouse and dual key close to $1.5M and several recent projects close to $2M
 
all buyers combined income are below $12K ... or bi good ... but many got richi parents ... bo tai chi
i suppose the parent cpf after selling the hdb probably sponsor $500K into the unit especially for penthouse and dual-key
 
 

imagine buying a $1m property when your combined income is below $12k

if im in your situation, i wont ... my wife also not working ever since we got married 7yrs ago, have 2 young kids (6yr and 2yr)...my current situation is 4-rm punggol flat(6yrs old) fully paid up by next feb'14, my car also fully paid up by jan'14 (left 3yrs).... so, im aiming for debt free ...and by then, building up retirement fund for me and wife, and study fund for my kids,...nothing else matters.......
 
perhaps due to where i come from, coming from up north, if im to go private, it's going to be landed or nothing... never a fan of condo or Ec (to me, it's just a private hdb with more bells and whistles but cost an arm and a leg...... anyway, im quite sure i cant afford a landed since im in a sunset industry, so that helps in my decision making as well, i dont have problem faced by those with more $$$..... hehehe....

Dun mean it in any bad way but for hdb, being 'debt free' not much meaning. U can't monetise it thru a home equity loan and even hdb loan is only 0.1% above CPF OA. Plus, i assume you're not retired and are still collecting CPF every month. Since u say you're from finance industry, u shld know the diff between good debt vs bad debt. 
 
Btw, $1M for 4-bedder EC is super cheap. For pte, min $1.8M liao.

Your "chickening" out from making that commitment, fortunately is the wisest decision in your life. Up John you 5. Don't loose sleep over that decision which was not committed.

my preference would be the pte condo route and retaining the HDB
 
more flexibility but not at the current prices though
 
got money can afford doesn't mean jump in straight away
 
btw your finance job pay is very good imho 
 
but some here will say otherwise

Nothing wrong with listening to your instincts.

lol my BIL just bought a EC in the north region. But it's close to his workplace, so still ok.
 
The only ECs i ever thought of buying was Esparina at Buangkok (excellent location for an EC) and the tampines ones which i would consider if i was an easterner.

too late to buy now because hdb resale price so not doing so well now
 
last time mbt dont want to build so many hdb, so hdb resale price very strong. now kbw build many hdb and release many ec land. one ec, i estimate got 50% upgrader. one ec, i estimate, got 400 units. so when an ec top, 200 resale hdb will be released into the market. this is on top of the brand new hdb released by Govt. so your resale price wont be solid
 
if want to buy ec, should have hoot 3 years ago when they just restarted the ec thing. not now. 3 yeara ago, the price got 500+, 600+. now the price 700+, 800+ 
 
my friend told me the sebawang ec, i think call sky garden or something like that, is the last ec liao. Govt gonna review ec. i dont know how he know one. i think he is tia gong one. doono zhun or not
 
somemore now the ec are subjected to new rulings:
1) cannot be bigger than 1600sqf
2) if open areas which cannot be covered up one (such as balcony or patio or roff terrace) are sold to each owner, then Govt will charge develeper marnie for these open areas. if these open areas are used as commnual areas then it is free for developer. this is why it makes a lot of sense to build a communual giant sky garden (in the case of the sembawang ec)

yup... agree on the hdb pricing going south.
It also appears the ECs are just so that the upgraders will have more options of an 'atas' place, and they buy EC and release their hdbs so there'll be more places + new flats for first time hdb buyers
 
how these upgraders will pay for their million dollar new flats is not really hdb's problem... its no more kiddy glove hdb loan, its the proper banks...
 
your friend is not really right on the EC info. The last 2 ECs will be launched in jurong west next year. This info is available on ura website.
but seems govt policy is reversible, like when they decided to stop EC  scheme years back, and making a comeback now...
 
i did view the sembawang ec.... the pricing seems out of whack at 780/psf
coincidentally there is a pte condo across the road from this EC, top 2001.... and the latest transacted price there for 2013 (based on ura) :  $660/psf

actually the high price for ec now is a side effect of the "cannot sell open area to owner rule" (be careful what one wish for!  )
 
old rule:
all along Govt give 20% bonus open space to developer. then deevelopers sell these open space as balcony, patio, roof terrace, bay window, to owner at a reduced price. that is why if a unit has massive amount of open space, then the psf is low. These open space helps to reduce psf per unit, while the developer still can earn.
 
new rule: 
now Govt say that if developer sells these open space to owner, developper has to pay marnie to Govt. so developer lan lan, now use all these 20% bonus free open space as communual space, such as a giant roof garden. But developer got earn some marnie from selling open space in old rule. By building a giant roof garden in scenario 2, they dont get any any marnie. So how to maintain the profits as per old rule? raise the psf of new rule lor! 
 
conclusion: this is why the condos are affected by the new rule has a higher psf
basically each unit's balcony/patio/roof terrace (in old rule) had just transformed and merge into the commnual giant roof terrace (as in new rule). somemore the psf add another 20%

actually the high price for ec now is a side effect of the "cannot sell open area to owner rule" (be careful what one wish for!  )
 
old rule:
all along Govt give 20% bonus open space to developer. then deevelopers sell these open space as balcony, patio, roof terrace, bay window, to owner at a reduced price. that is why if a unit has massive amount of open space, then the psf is low. These open space helps to reduce psf per unit, while the developer still can earn.
 
new rule: 
now Govt say that if developer sells these open space to owner, developper has to pay marnie to Govt. so developer lan lan, now use all these 20% bonus free open space as communual space, such as a giant roof garden. But developer got earn some marnie from selling open space in old rule. By building a giant roof garden in scenario 2, they dont get any any marnie. So how to maintain the profits as per old rule? raise the psf of new rule lor! 
 
conclusion: this is why the condos are affected by the new rule has a higher psf
basically each unit's balcony/patio/roof terrace (in old rule) had just transformed and merge into the commnual giant roof terrace (as in new rule). somemore the psf add another 20% 

 
are balconies affected? or only PES? 
 
This skypark still has big balcony + super lot of AC ledges ...

old rule, new rule, future rule .... developer only has one objective which is to make money ... lots and lots of money
whether to build one giant communal space or sell "emtpy space" at reduced price ... buyer has to foot the bill
 
govt make money
developer make money
investor make money
 
live in owner pay money ... the more they can borrow ... the more they had to pay up
 
when the borrowing stop ... the crazy price will stop
till then ... huat ah!!!
 
seriously, i won't blame the developer. they can bid $1000psf for the land and sell $1500psf to buyer
it's the buyer that take sky high loan to finance the pigeon hole condo
then govt will kaypoh ... "asset rich, cash poor"
 
taking an international affordability benchmark of property = 5x yearly income
$1M = $200K income per annum
in spore $1M condo is considered mass market ... mostly <1000sqft
all these units sell like hot cakes
which mean every soul you see enter the showroom are earning $200k per annum and nothing less
if you divide by 2 person = $100k / 12 months = $8300 = this is the minimum salary per head

hey guys i'm jumping into this thread to get your views on property....
 
I'm happily married, stay in 5 room, spacious old hdb.
The best things  I like are the unobstructed view, as we face a lake, and the loan is fully repaid 
Wife not working and looking after our kids.
 
Recently I got itchy backside, and realising I could still qualify for EC (barely), I went to look at the new EC launches.
 
I was surprised at a few things....
 
1) The crowd flocking there like its something given out FOC
2) The price .... $750/psf and above, meaning $1m and above for 4 bedrooms...  
3) The proximity of the apartments, mostly facing inwards towards the pool, and each other, with full floor to ceiling glass walls (no more looking out to the horizon, just your neighbours' hall and bedroom). Even the ones facing exterior are facing future developments, and no guarantee of open views.
 
I almost, almost bought one unit on impulse, ready to give my cheque, but excused myself for a breather..... and drove straight home... *phew*
 
If you have a good, rare though old hdb unit, would you sell it and upgrade to EC with no view, stuck in it for at least 8 years (3 years to TOP + 5 years minimum occupation period before you can sell) and get into debt again   (probably for half a mil after selling off HDB)
 
Or would you hold on to your hdb, buy a pte condo when the market dips (with additional 7% Additional Buyer Stamp Duty for 2nd property, retain half of cpf minimum sum in OA etc etc) and rent out your hdb. As its pte condo, easier to sell off, and move back to my hdb should I wish.
 
I'm worried about debt as for sure interest rates will be back at a high by 2016 (i'm in finance related job)...... think lots of people will be in trouble at this point, especially EC dwellers.... imagine buying a $1m property when your combined income is below $12k. I strongly believe property price correction is due then...
 
Also, people keep saying buying an EC is an investment, but is that so?
It depends on which cycle you're at, and this is one helluva peak.
 
And I will miss the heavenly feeling of being debt free :(

 
From all the points you made, it would appear what you have preferred

Many still wishing for a crash
Another Lehman Brothers crash scenario is unlikely to happen -- as all the mechanisms are in place to prevent this
 
What's the RISK
A default by US or one of the Euro governments?
Will this cause a collapse? -- not likely, because they are printing their way out BUT they may end up selling their national assets
And most likely China (incl Singapore) is ready on hand ..... to buy into them
 
How about Risk from China?
Local governments may be over-geared? Are figures reported by banks truly reflective?
Yes, these are concerns.  But the Central government is a Strong regulator - it does not need to consult and does not need to give grace.  In this regulatory environment, any potential problem can be resolved quickly PLUS the Central government is financially VERY powerful 
 
Just sharing personal thoughts

Why buy EC?Although high popularity doesn't mean it's the best, EC does have LOTS of merit
 
-  1st time applicants can apply grant upto 30k (this is savings)
-  2nd time applicants don't need to pay resale levy (this is savings)-  According to media reports, most launch prices are 25-30% lower than condos of similar location (this is savings)If one is looking for Condo lifestyle and wants a BIG place to stay, is there another option other than EC?
 
Should Property Planning start from young? Or wait till 45? 55?- should you buy BTO, then Condo later?- should you buy EC?
 
Do you prefer a conservative or aggressive approach?Do you prefer a balanced one?
There is no universally right answer, property planning is a personal CHOICE
And with all choices, you reap the consequencesThe only PERFECT plan is to rewind the clock
... Just personal thoughts

crash? very highly unlikely
 
emergency brake already put in place to avoid crash
even crash come ... they can kick the can down the road ... music continues
 
usa is high on qe and raising debt ceiling
imagine stop qe and do not allow to raise debt ceiling is like pushing the patient out of ER ... die immediately
 
europe is high on bailout ... living on bailout-to-bailout year-to-year
thanks to the euro currency, one country fall affect all ... so die die must bailout
 
china is high on sustaining gdp above 7.5%
india is high on growing domestic economy

i recognise that external factors and world economy do have impact on property price
but ... local factor is the MAJOR influence to property price
demand and supply
 
demand ... can open floodgate, can remove CM, can reduce sales of land, can change policy, can do many many things
supply ... can up/down BTO & EC projects, can increase/decrease land sales, can also do many many things
local policy changes and CM has direct impact on property price rather than usa/europe collapse or lehman brother collapse
 
even world economy tank to bottom ... if govt step in ... govt can "stablise" the property price
you think govt will let property price free fall and crash?

you still believe in the China and India growth fairy tale?
 
the next phase of growth will likely come from developed countries
 
but they have to get past the current difficulties first
 
when that happens, the liquidity will flow back to their own countries
 
meanwhile, the world would just muddle along

then you have to hope that their "sustainable" gdp growth figures are true figures and not massaged data, which they are well known for
 
in the latter case, the crash will be highly unexpected and will drag the whole world down to hell together

correction would be about 5%
 
anything more would be a result of a serious external shock/ black swan
 
read a savills report that demand will continue to chase supply all the way to 2015. Thank ICA for that

There's more to this rule.......
 
It's to force more on the fence to convert to citizenship in preparation of 2016.
 
If these people can convert to citizenship instead of just taking up PR, they immediately qualify for NEW HDB flat at SUBSIDIZED price. Hence, new flats supply was ramped up.

One of the PSLE question:
 
Given our population as of Jun 2013: 5.399m and household size currently averaging 3.53
what is the projected population based on 500,000 new homes? ignore death rate about 18400 - last yr
 
 Clue
5.399m plus 500,000 x 3.53 = ?
 
Even if household size dips to 3.3
projected increase: 5.399m plus 500,000 x 3.3 = ?

you are talking about current situation where China govt has plenty of reserves to back them up
 
i was responding to a post about China has not started printing $$ like the US to sustain growth
 
in this case when China has used up all their reserves and start to use debt(or print $$) to sustain GDP growth
 
will you still dare to buy when China defaulting on their loans becomes a possibility ?
