Take it with a pinch of salt.
 

Normally people who stays in the best condos will not bother to vote.
 

Look at the one with the most votes....752 units!!! If everyone staying there vote, sure win la...
 

Infact, most of the condos that win has more than 400 units.

The Botanika?

Sweeeeee.....

Back in 1999 it was an old 30 yr stand alone walkup apartment block which i considered buying a unit at.

Cant remember the name, i think dragon mansion or something.

In the end i bought another property just off Cluny Road.

Not too long after this old apartment block went enbloc and Botanika rose from the ashes......
 

  one of my personal favorites

Beautiful, stylish design... the Botanika....

What is best? Best for own stay?

IMHO if that condo can sell means its best in some ways, eg value for $ if compare to location, facilities or finishing provided.

Soldout within a month or even lesser than weeks will be consider best condo, but not MM development.

Such awards, if conducted by professional and non-commercial bodies, eg Institutes of enginneers or architects, etc, and if there is transparency in the background, vested interest of the participants making the votes, will be worth a look. Otherwise, like you said, they are just marketing plots by the developers, or owners.
