Your door face west or east?
 
Tell him your door is facing east when entering lah. Simple.
 
Add another 5K to the price for East facing door.

The buyer say stand in the unit lookout of the door cannot face any west. As a non believer of geomancy, won't make any sense to me.

It's the Vastu shastra thing lah. Much like the Chinese Fengshui.
 
http://www.vastushastraguru.com/west-facing-house-vastu/
 

 

You might have heard from many people – I can call them ill-informed people – that living in a South direction property is bad or living in a West facing one is always going to invite troubles in life etc. but that’s not the case.
Here, I must tell you that vastu shastra never claims that North is a good direction to orient a home and West is bad. In fact, as per vastu shastra, all the directions are equally good to orient a house. However, the thing that makes or breaks vastu for a house is the location of the entrance or main door of the house.
That’s the reason why for each and every direction – be it North, East, South or West – vastu shastra has got rules and principles for locating the entrance of the house.
Now, since we’re dealing with West facing houses, let’s have a look at vastu for West facing house.

Have encountered several such people recently trying to self-rent out a property.
 
They will come up with anything just to force your price, especially those of a certain group which I will not specify here.
 
Main thing is be rational about what you are offering and what price you are getting - every property has some kind of weaknesses, focus on the sincere buyers and those who can appreciate its strengths.

Tell him you come home face East good what?
 
Go out face west, also good what?
 
Add 5K more to the price to make it more attractive and prestigious. 
 
Sometimes it's because you priced too low. Low attracts low ballers.
 
Anyway, he already made up his mind it's bad and there's nothing you can move your door. Next better buyer please.

My door not facing direct west,  it is north west.  If the buyer likes my place but very particular about door orientation,  can tilt the door to face north, construct another door inside facing north or use mirrors to correct lor.  
Sometimes i see people choose auspicious date to get married end up divorce after few years.  I married during ghost month and happily married for almost 20 years liao.

Yes, it's a big thing for traditional Hindus. 
 
No sillier than the Chinese belief in geomancy (feng shui) and numerology. 
 
And judging by the number of Chinese owned businesses that undertake expensive reno on the advice of a geomancer, and the number of "nice" plates I see on my daily commute, I'd say superstition is big business in Singapore.

As with all things - Beauty (or value) is in the eye of the beholder. There will be all kinds of buyers, from the low-ballers to the more cin-cai anything-goes types. Each one has their own belief system, superstitions, preferences and quirks. 
 
From my experience, geomancy-centred buyers will be the most extreme - If anything doesn't suit their charted alignments, it's a no; or if it does - You have an extremely keen buyer and great bargaining power over them because inherently their choices for units are extremely limited. 
 
There are of course the dollar-counters. They are keen on the unit but will always haggle about the price and try every means to press it down. Sometimes they will press and fight over the smallest amount (My record is $112 - Just die die wanted to round down from a fixed figure to an -888 amount) and think that you desperately need them to buy your unit. They will scrutinise and try to point out every fault to press the price. Very tiring and time-consuming dealing with these so usually, even your agent will play hardball with them.
 
On the other side of the coins there are also those who really appreciate and like the place for what it is and will just offer based on your asking price. This is probably everybody's preferred type of buyer. Sometimes how tastefully you renovate your home or putting some effort into doing some spruce-up before marketing can make this difference. I was quite blessed to have encountered such a buyer once before. 
 
However, price is only but one aspect of dealing and its not all about the money - Sometimes I feel one has to give-and-take and look for win-win also. Because before you can deal, you also have to take into consideration other factors like how much time you need before moving out and handing over to the buyer, while giving the latter adequate time to renovate etc. Likewise for yourself if you are moving to a new place.

When I was selling my parent's flat. This guy views the unit and said he don't like marble flooring .. the unit is not to his taste. At the end, he bought my parents unit at my price not his.
 
The buyer will come out with whatever reason to "hiam" the unit. I would do the same as well if I am buying,

Haha, I don't know if I'm what you'd call a "traditional Hindu". It seems I might believe in S*tan more than anything else. 
 

But from what I understand from my mom, etc., another superstition is that you shouldn't buy a cul-de-sac house. Very bad luck. 
 

Googling, I think cul-de-sacs have significance for feng shui as well. I have a feeling traditional Indian and Chinese culture share quite a few weird things lol.

that means corner unit? I like corner units - it has lots more privacy. 
 
main thing is unit must not face the afternoon sun. it will heat up the whole house and the heat will get trapped in the concrete walls right till 8+/9+pm.

Not corner unit.
 
It should be the unit located at a dead end.
Prior to this forum, I also didn't know it is considered bad luck.

I would've done that for them too honestly, if they really didn't nitpick almost everything in the house just to force a lower price.
Lucky for me someone ended up offering a much higher price.

Totally agree! 
When I got my first unit - It was an East-West facing unit.
Morning sun was good because it's a big help when you dry your clothes and most of the time, bar weekends, it is unlikely you're at home to feel much of its effects. But when it comes to afternoon and evening sun damn jialat cos' it really heats up all the walls and you can feel that latent heat that remains  - Worse still, that unit was a corridor unit so the entire stretch of the living area and one bedroom was essentially warm even into the night.

Actually west sun in bedroom not as bad as west sun in living room. There are some buyers who like to see the setting sun and don't mind west facing. There are many sea facing apartments in East coast facing the west but buyers can tahan the heat for the sake of sea view.

b. Cal de suc no good as if fire on one way, we can escape through other side.
 
Indian or Feng Shui must have some reasons behind every "rule" originally. Some of them jacked or modified for "business" purposes.

For my configuration, main door facing north-west so living room and master bedroom has only east sun. From my understanding, feng shui can usually be altered using mirrors, guess Indian feng shui is less creative compared to Chinese feng shui.

My door not facing direct west, it is north west. If the buyer likes my place but very particular about door orientation, can tilt the door to face north, construct another door inside facing north or use mirrors to correct lor.

I'm not particularly superstitious but even I wouldn't buy a cul de sac house. That's probably the most deep seated superstition among Chinese property buyers. The rest I don't really care.
Weirdos like to hang out together and share weird stuff

Landed houses located in a cul de sac command a premium for exclusivity,privacy and more parking space.

Because choose date is only for the luck that day.  
Fengshui is what cause the occupants to feel good or bad. 
 
Imagine sited along expressway, or near mrt line, the noise level so high, will cause occupants to have higher level of cortisol, 
The windows all face west, so must close to reduce noise, then all windows closed + west facing, unit temperature very high and stuffy. Must on Air-con daily for whole house. 
 
This type of life sure stressful, occupants may become easily agitated,  so quarrel very often. 
 
My explanation sound logical right?
Lol, fengshui very important for happy family life.

How does front door facing west with no west sun entering the house from any window add to the stress of the occupants?

Actually to me this is pure rubbish. What if the house is situated in the western part of the island, isn't that more serious than just having the door facing west, north-west or south-west? With some reno, the door direction can be altered to face another direction other than west, but the location of the house is fixed (e.g. Jurong will always be in the western part of the island). 
 
Anyway, LKY thinks fengshui is "utter rubbish" as well...

Like an aircraft or vessel, the heading is more important.  
Because earth is spherical, the same heading will eventually takes it to the same spot. So siting or location is secondary.
But we need to identify the magnetic north and true north. 
 
The difference is known as variation.
Then compass if minute error is known as deviation.
 
So in order to accurately measure the true direction there must be calibration of the compass deviation and calculation of the magnetic variation to fined the true north.

A person's destiny being determined by the direction his house door faces must be the most absurd thing. What about people who get married in the hungry ghost month? Their marriages will be doomed? What about those with unit numbers #04-04 or #14-44, people living inside gets struck by calamity?

If that is the case, the same can be said about doors facing east from the inside looking out, coz when the person returns home, he will be entering the door in the west direction into his house, so does it mean the person will die in an accident or meet with calamity in his house?

i can understand the west facing on the practical aspects. even morden architectural design will avoid or add sun shadding fins to reduce heat load especially for tropical countries like ours. 
 
the other reasons is the wind direction during the monsoon seasons. 
 
But,  faci g west does not mean you cannot do anything to overcome the direct sun.

There are a lot of fake Feng Shui masters and people will limited knowledge always kenna con by them.
 
If you a West person a West door is good for you.
 
West, North West, South West and North East are all good for a West person.
 
Just as North, East, South East and South are good for East person.
 
The direction of the main door is not good or bad, it is good for some
 
people and bad for others.

I think you have to weigh in old traditions which are still very much adhered too be it in the Indians or Chinese which are like the 2 oldest civilsations here and very still deeply entrenched here when doing certain rites and observations ; As like the Christians avoid the number 13 , Chinese dont like anything with 4 and Indians like everything with a number 1. Likewise the Indians and Chinese - Red/Orange is an auspicious color too but nowadays they wear black even during CNY or Diwali.......... No destiny is being determined, its just historical mate....... no need to argue about such things...... in the modern age n day with our crammed country...... any number is fine
The muslims on the other hand like the number 786 and their auspicious colour is Green; Of course you would wonder where the Red Shirts came around now   
 
BTW you will find very few or No popular car models / phone models  or even electric appliances with a number 13 in it;  So such things go up all the way even in commercialisation in Europe or USA too

Just sharing my thoughts since landed is mentioned: For landed houses in Singapore, currently due to constant Dengue and Zika mozzie threats, I think NorthWest facing is the best. 
 
Mozzies dont like bright places and hides in dark cool places. NorthWest facing generally is the brightest inside without the full blown west facing heat. Note that all landed being own building  will get full noon sun above regardless of facing, just that direct west and east facing have permanent front and rear direct sun (eg west face: rear kitchen rising sun, front porch setting sun). South facing houses will dark from noon onwards.
 
Northwest facing : morning: rear kitchen side rising sun only, front porch morning bright but cool as no direct sun, can have breakfast at porch or kitchen till late. Car cool in porch. Noon: all houses same. Afternoon: front diagonal sun should end about 5pm as it is not direct west. Now has nippon solarreflect paint for external wall that can drop up to 5deg heat. The house will be bright yet cool enough. Also kitchen will be cooling for cooking unlike south facing houses (hot diagonal evening sun at the back ie kitchen). 
 
Cheers!

Lol no bro. Just GENERALLY northwest landed house brighter than other facing without the heat of direct west sun. Very general lah as many variables like if house narrow but long then also will be dark inside unless got skylight window. South facing landed especially inter terrace by evening the house is dim from covered car porch to kitchen. I live in one south facing for years so from my experience. Come to think about it there got more mozzie....One relative bought northwest landed (stillKept the other) just for this brighter reasoning (that's how I get to know this reasoning). :)

The Indians are even more superstitious than Chinese.  Their astrology and geomancy more complicated.  So no choice.  
 
If u can't sell to a buyer, then its fated that the buyer has no destiny with your home.

tiagong South Korean President Park bought many many of this........     She must have gotten at a very cheap price...... 

A storeroom is usually a place to store unused and unwanted stuff, why they want to place their "god" inside?
Actually west sun in bedroom not as bad as west sun in living room. There are some buyers who like to see the setting sun and don't mind west facing. There are many sea facing apartments in East coast facing the west but buyers can tahan the heat for the sake of sea view.

 
yeah, it's common practice for indians.  Their alter is in storeroom......

This one I heard about before. But usually dry kitchen "stove" is induction type while the wet kitchen is gas type. I heard only when there are 2 gas type in different locations in the house then counted as 2 lady owners. How true I dont know  
 
But I agree with some of you here. Dead end house cannot buy.
