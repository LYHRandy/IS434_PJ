It dawned on me last night, that in the long term, as I grow older, it would make more sense to actually rent.  Some of the reasons being that
 
1.  Am single, so i have no need to put my assets in property.  summore, nobody to pass on to
 
2.  As I age, I free my properties for liquidity
 
3.  I dun really need a home, but sth to sleep.  I can sleep in a tent for alli care...hahaha, or get a MAser and sleep in it.
 
 
Been reading and this argument has been debated ad nauseum.  Discuss.

Should You Buy A House Or Rent? The Economics Of Homeownership

All the 20-somethings who have jobs are asking me: should we buy a house or keep renting? The answer isn’t so easy. The common wisdom for decades was to buy a house as soon as you can, because it’s a great investment. That “wisdom” turned lots of people upside down in the past decade. Let’s take a cold, hard look at the economics of owning a home.
In the past, the own-or-rent decision was largely about whether to live in a house or apartment. That’s no longer true. Condos allow ownership of a multi-family residence, and the opportunities to rent a stand-alone house are greater than ever before. So the own-rent decision should be apples-to-apples with comparable properties. If you are thinking about moving from a small apartment and buying a medium sized house, you’ll find that it’s more expensive simply because you’re getting more square footage and a yard.
 
 
Is housing still a good investment? Since 1975, housing has appreciated by an average of 4.5 percent per year. (Good data start in 1975.) Estimates of housing appreciation since 1890 (courtesy of Robert Shiller) show 3.0 percent annual increases in nominal value, and just a hair above zero after adjusting for inflation. Stocks, on the other hand, have a long-run average return of 9.8 percent including dividends.
Housing seems to be a great investment in good times because it is usually leveraged to a great degree. With a 20 percent down payment, a price increase of just three percent turns into a 15 percent increase in the homeowner’s equity. (Do some arithmetic with a hypothetical $100,000 home to verify that result.) Real estate proponents call this the “cash-on-cash” return. However, leverage applies to the downside as well. With 20 percent down, a 20 percent price decline wipes out all of the buyer’s equity. That’s not an outlandish scenario, we’ve learned from the price declines of the recent housing bust.
Interest on home mortgages is deductible, which sounds good but is frequently overrated. Yes, it’s deductible. But the deductibility doesn’t offset the fact that you are paying someone interest. It’s an expense, and you are worse off because of it. If you want a big tax deduction, you could make a contribution to charity. You’ll end up with less money than before your contribution despite the deduction. The same is true for interest expense.  It may be worthwhile, all things considered, but it’s still an expense. Talk to your accountant first, because the actual benefit from a deduction varies from family to family.
The housing-stock market comparison ignores a key point: housing pays something like a dividend in that you can live in it without paying rent. To be as good as stocks (on average), the benefit from living in a house has to pay an “occupancy dividend” of about seven percent. So if you’re thinking of a $200,000 home, you need to get $14,000 per year of benefit from living in it. That’s comparable to $1,167 of monthly rent, before we get around to the pesky details.
When you rent, the landlord picks up the taxes, insurance, maintenance and sometimes utilities. If you buy, plan on replacing the water heater some years, the back fence other years, the roof occasionally. Hope that you don’t need to replace all of them the same year. If you are going to hire out all of the maintenance, you’ll probably pay more than your landlord does. The landlord is in the business of maintaining properties and is probably very efficient. However, if you can do some of it yourself, your cash outlays will be much less than the landlord’s. And you can do it yourself if you’re be willing to learn. Try Googling “leaky faucet” and you’ll find plenty of advice.
Most people thinking about buying compare monthly payments to rent, which is a good starting point. However, some of that monthly payment goes to principal. It’s like saving. To put buying on a level playing field with renting, look at just the part of the monthly payment that will go to interest.
Example: you borrow $200,000 house with a 30-year mortgage at 4.25 percent. Your monthly payment would be $993, but $285 of that would be going to principal. (Your parents will be surprised that you’re paying so much to principal. When they got their first mortgage, rates were much higher and only a small portion of their payments went to principal.) To do your own calculations, use Excel functions PMT, IPMT and PPMT.
Transaction costs are large in housing. Real estate agents charge six to seven percent commission on sales, which will make moving expensive. You can sell the house yourself, but keep in mind that it’s a lot of work and your house may not be exposed to as many buyers, reducing the price you can get for it. This argues against buying unless you are confident you want to stay in the house for several years, preferably even longer.
Renters should keep in mind that they do not control their housing destiny. If the landlord decides to sell the property, you’ll be looking for a new home. The landlord can also raise the rent at the end of the lease. The landlord can also decide not to rent to you, though that’s rare for people who are well behaved.
One of the benefits of owning a house is the ability to do with it what you want (subject to neighborhood rules, of course). When your daughter wants her bedroom walls black, you can be the cool parents who show her how to use a paint roller. You can build that gazebo in the back yard and have toilets in any color of the rainbow.
Owning a house gives you some flexibility, but also requires flexibility. When you get a bonus from work, you can upgrade your housing by adding a hot tub. Renters don’t have that option. When you lose your job, you can defer replacing the carpet.
Flexibility is required of you, too. When the roof starts to leak, there’s no telling the rain that this is a bad time. You need to have reserves for unplanned repairs.
So now you’re ready for the economist to give you a conclusion. However, there are too many emotional factors for a mathematical solution. I recommend running the numbers as best you can, then asking yourself if the psychic benefits are worth the cost

Renting would make sense in your case. No happy with the place, can always seek other places to stay. Less baggage and less fuss.

Pundek, you no need buy, no need rent.
Just stay rent-free with Porker.
 
You will pay in other ways.
 
Cannot guarantee a certain body orifice also remains rent-free, if you get my cheem meaning (rent means tear).

Besides at retirement age the timing we come in and go out will be off-peak hours so traffic should not be a problem.

The retirement village is not just some house or shoplot. It is purpose built and has facilities (e.g. medical) to take care of elderly.

it's cheap compare to spore cost and after sgd conversion
but it's not cheap by its means

It dawned on me last night, that in the long term, as I grow older, it would make more sense to actually rent.  Some of the reasons being that
 
1.  Am single, so i have no need to put my assets in property.  summore, nobody to pass on to
 
2.  As I age, I free my properties for liquidity
 
3.  I dun really need a home, but sth to sleep.  I can sleep in a tent for alli care...hahaha, or get a MAser and sleep in it.
 
 

 
Not too sure how much cash (liquidity) you have on hand. 
 
But if you have an asset, it will be appreciating till you want to cash out.
Since, you are single, maybe good to buy just a 3-rm flat. No need so big, but enough space for your own living, and also entertaining (to friends / relatives).
 
When you really aged until jia lat time, then sell off your asset, to gain some capital gain (or more cash), then reside yourself in old folks home and pay them to sustain your general well-being till you die (if you have no NOK).
 
At least, I feel, you won't be a burden to anyone, and can "go off" anytime. Extra cash, will be hand over to funeral parlor to just settle for a simple funeral proceedings, so you won't own anyone any money.
 
Just my humble opinions :)

Valid inputs thanks.
 
While your views still reside on asset maximisation, which i dun deny is impt.  I have reached a stage of my life where it is not.
 
Let me elaborate.  Truth is that my lifespan is shorter than others, hard truth and I am cognizant of that fact.  I dun foresee myself seeing 2025.  Thus, I am giving myself these 10yrs, to consolidate, leave no liabilities and setup a trust fund and then i can go in peace.  that is the plan going forward.  
 
So in the short term ahead, not now at least, at the next onset of an up cycle, liquidate, start a tenure and clear all assets at it's potential max.  Not counting CPF as any of my asets that is for eye candy only.

Debate of rent vs purchase has been ongoing for years.. 
 
Most people in SG having this dilemma owns a property. 
 
Those who have been renting for 10 years or more, usually no property. U ask them if they have $ to buy property 10 years ago but chooses to rent instead of buy, any regret? Most will most probably say they might buy a property soon when market corrects, instead of continuing renting..

It dawned on me last night, that in the long term, as I grow older, it would make more sense to actually rent.  Some of the reasons being that
 
1.  You can sleep in your hearse. If inside got an empty coffin, even more comfortable. 

 
Joking aside, your other comment about not seeing 2025 shows that we have different priorities. At that time, I'm looking at the having a small family, so leasing (from HDB, since we're all technically tenants for 99 years, and not owners) my own apartment would still be more viable for me. I don't like landlord raising my rent at any time or selling the unit so that I need to move, etc. Same way I'd rather buy a car than lease it, even with the current unappealing downpayment schemes.

While your views still reside on asset maximisation, which i dun deny is impt.  I have reached a stage of my life where it is not.
 
Let me elaborate.  Truth is that my lifespan is shorter than others, hard truth and I am cognizant of that fact.  I dun foresee myself seeing 2025.  Thus, I am giving myself these 10yrs, to consolidate, leave no liabilities and setup a trust fund and then i can go in peace.  that is the plan going forward.  
 
So in the short term ahead, not now at least, at the next onset of an up cycle, liquidate, start a tenure and clear all assets at it's potential max.  Not counting CPF as any of my asets that is for eye candy only.

 
I am scared when you said your lifespan is shorter than others, and you will see yourself till 2025.
That means you have only another 11 years to live?
 
Sorry .... If thats the case, making final arrangements are the best way forward.
Just enjoy life and as the saying goes: You bring nothing to earth when born, and you bring nothing back when pass away.

Renting would make sense in your case. No happy with the place, can always seek other places to stay. Less baggage and less fuss.

Right you are bro...and call a spade a spade, I have seen death in the face ( well literally) hahaha..so I know and can attest tt making early preps for any early 'exit' is imminent.  Even more so for me as anything can happen.  Not to be pessimistic, but you 'plan to fail, if you fail to plan'...hahahaha
 
Guess, this would be the wisest option for me going forward.  Guess, the option of renting a boat for stay sometime would also suit me hahaahahah

But hor, if you fail to plan for death, and then because you didn't plan, and you failed death, isn't that success? Hahaha..

Flat prices appreciates over the years... Rental prices also appreciates over the years. 
Imagine 10yrs ago you could buy 3-rm flat at $200,000. Down payment $20,000, stamp duty and legal fees $3,500. Monthly loan repayment $700 over 30yrs. That's 10yrs ago hor...
Now, resale prices doubled. If you didn't buy a flat back then... Luckily with $700 you can still afford to rent a bedroom now.
The scariest part is when you are retired, after paying rental to home owners for 30yrs you are still homeless. I dunno who much a room rental will cost in far future, definitely won't stay at $700 for a bedroom.
Retired, old and homeless person who didn't have the foresight to buy a home usually go where to stay arh?
The smart home buyer already finished paying off his mortgage before retirement and he is now subletting his spare bedrooms at $700/rm for retirement passive income. LOLx

It dawned on me last night, that in the long term, as I grow older, it would make more sense to actually rent.  Some of the reasons being that
 
1.  Am single, so i have no need to put my assets in property.  summore, nobody to pass on to
 
2.  As I age, I free my properties for liquidity
 
3.  I dun really need a home, but sth to sleep.  I can sleep in a tent for alli care...hahaha, or get a MAser and sleep in it.
 
 
Been reading and this argument has been debated ad nauseum.  Discuss.

Should You Buy A House Or Rent? The Economics Of Homeownership
 

  4 comments, 4 called-out
Comment NowFollow Comments




All the 20-somethings who have jobs are asking me: should we buy a house or keep renting? The answer isn’t so easy. The common wisdom for decades was to buy a house as soon as you can, because it’s a great investment. That “wisdom” turned lots of people upside down in the past decade. Let’s take a cold, hard look at the economics of owning a home.
In the past, the own-or-rent decision was largely about whether to live in a house or apartment. That’s no longer true. Condos allow ownership of a multi-family residence, and the opportunities to rent a stand-alone house are greater than ever before. So the own-rent decision should be apples-to-apples with comparable properties. If you are thinking about moving from a small apartment and buying a medium sized house, you’ll find that it’s more expensive simply because you’re getting more square footage and a yard.
 
 
Is housing still a good investment? Since 1975, housing has appreciated by an average of 4.5 percent per year. (Good data start in 1975.) Estimates of housing appreciation since 1890 (courtesy of Robert Shiller) show 3.0 percent annual increases in nominal value, and just a hair above zero after adjusting for inflation. Stocks, on the other hand, have a long-run average return of 9.8 percent including dividends.
Housing seems to be a great investment in good times because it is usually leveraged to a great degree. With a 20 percent down payment, a price increase of just three percent turns into a 15 percent increase in the homeowner’s equity. (Do some arithmetic with a hypothetical $100,000 home to verify that result.) Real estate proponents call this the “cash-on-cash” return. However, leverage applies to the downside as well. With 20 percent down, a 20 percent price decline wipes out all of the buyer’s equity. That’s not an outlandish scenario, we’ve learned from the price declines of the recent housing bust.
Interest on home mortgages is deductible, which sounds good but is frequently overrated. Yes, it’s deductible. But the deductibility doesn’t offset the fact that you are paying someone interest. It’s an expense, and you are worse off because of it. If you want a big tax deduction, you could make a contribution to charity. You’ll end up with less money than before your contribution despite the deduction. The same is true for interest expense.  It may be worthwhile, all things considered, but it’s still an expense. Talk to your accountant first, because the actual benefit from a deduction varies from family to family.
The housing-stock market comparison ignores a key point: housing pays something like a dividend in that you can live in it without paying rent. To be as good as stocks (on average), the benefit from living in a house has to pay an “occupancy dividend” of about seven percent. So if you’re thinking of a $200,000 home, you need to get $14,000 per year of benefit from living in it. That’s comparable to $1,167 of monthly rent, before we get around to the pesky details.
When you rent, the landlord picks up the taxes, insurance, maintenance and sometimes utilities. If you buy, plan on replacing the water heater some years, the back fence other years, the roof occasionally. Hope that you don’t need to replace all of them the same year. If you are going to hire out all of the maintenance, you’ll probably pay more than your landlord does. The landlord is in the business of maintaining properties and is probably very efficient. However, if you can do some of it yourself, your cash outlays will be much less than the landlord’s. And you can do it yourself if you’re be willing to learn. Try Googling “leaky faucet” and you’ll find plenty of advice.
Most people thinking about buying compare monthly payments to rent, which is a good starting point. However, some of that monthly payment goes to principal. It’s like saving. To put buying on a level playing field with renting, look at just the part of the monthly payment that will go to interest.
Example: you borrow $200,000 house with a 30-year mortgage at 4.25 percent. Your monthly payment would be $993, but $285 of that would be going to principal. (Your parents will be surprised that you’re paying so much to principal. When they got their first mortgage, rates were much higher and only a small portion of their payments went to principal.) To do your own calculations, use Excel functions PMT, IPMT and PPMT.
Transaction costs are large in housing. Real estate agents charge six to seven percent commission on sales, which will make moving expensive. You can sell the house yourself, but keep in mind that it’s a lot of work and your house may not be exposed to as many buyers, reducing the price you can get for it. This argues against buying unless you are confident you want to stay in the house for several years, preferably even longer.
Renters should keep in mind that they do not control their housing destiny. If the landlord decides to sell the property, you’ll be looking for a new home. The landlord can also raise the rent at the end of the lease. The landlord can also decide not to rent to you, though that’s rare for people who are well behaved.
One of the benefits of owning a house is the ability to do with it what you want (subject to neighborhood rules, of course). When your daughter wants her bedroom walls black, you can be the cool parents who show her how to use a paint roller. You can build that gazebo in the back yard and have toilets in any color of the rainbow.
Owning a house gives you some flexibility, but also requires flexibility. When you get a bonus from work, you can upgrade your housing by adding a hot tub. Renters don’t have that option. When you lose your job, you can defer replacing the carpet.
Flexibility is required of you, too. When the roof starts to leak, there’s no telling the rain that this is a bad time. You need to have reserves for unplanned repairs.
So now you’re ready for the economist to give you a conclusion. However, there are too many emotional factors for a mathematical solution. I recommend running the numbers as best you can, then asking yourself if the psychic benefits are worth the cost

Buying a property is an investment, with the hope that the value will appreciate over time. (So far this theory still holds.)
 
As in other regional countries like HK, ROC, Korea, those who did not manage to buy when they could had now deemed themselves to have "miss the boat". With their current income, they could not afford any. 
 
Renting, on the other hand, is 100% an expense. 
 
For most of us, buying is still the way to go. I had already planned to leave behind my two properties under  Trust to my children. Hope they can have  a good head-start.

You need not have to be a super-rich to  plan for a trust. It is not yet set up, just a plan in me and my wife's mind. Why? Because it has legal impact - e.g. irrevocable.
 
For full details of advantages, I am in no position. Consult Mr Google.
 
Why setting up a trust?
 
I have three children. I want them to continue to own the properties for as long as poss. Setting up a trust will in a way protect the asset, and I do not want them to dispose of the properties for x numbers of years. They can derive some incomes from the properties, and split them in accordance to my wish.

You can work towards wealth culmination too. Just make sure you "pay" yourself 40% of your income. Settle your all your liabililties e.g.  mortgage in double quick time (some people will have different idea here).
 
And most impt of all, spend less (not to short change yourself though). Eg buy a modest car instead of an expensive one. ANd only if you can comfortably afford.
 
IKEA owner Ingvar Kamprad used to drive a Hyundai car. Not that I agree with his thriftiness (he has tons of money beyond his current lifespan, so why short changed oneself) , but the lesson is there for us to learn.

Agree... If you chose the correct wife you will realise that the wife can work and earn more than you do. It can also do household chores, produce children, take care of children, cook and provide you with a lot of night time entertainment. Then you retire earlier than you would have if you didn't have her.If you chose the wrong wife, you get to pay for her shopping, spa, facial, manicure, pedicure, high tea, mahjong session, hire foreign maid, etc. and you can't retire forever.

I think if there are thousands of people in the same plight,  the govt might do a lease topup.

Confirmed there will be thousands of people in the same plight as there are tons of old flats around.

LKY said that hdb flats are assets, but with the dishonorable son, nothing is certain now.

Only MND/HDB has it.
 
Currently only those under SIT will see their lease expires 1st.

No need to have stats also can check the age of the flats ourselves. You can see many flats in many area are built in the 70s which the age of the flats mostly are 40 year old.

There are more locations than these 3 location. Like Geylang Baru, Boon Keng, Circuit Rd, Havelock Rd etc. Think in toa payoh alone, there are already lots of old flats.

Think the flat which transacted for a million is not old flat. Those flat should be built in the 90s. Should those flats next to Queenstown MRT. Those are not old flats. Old flats are those further up at the food centre and market area.

There's still some time before the 99 year leasehold period runs out for HDB flats.  Quite a lot of time. So why is it that all of a sudden, people are all being told  that they will be cut off?  What's the rationale for such a move?
 
Is this another political strategy or a fumble?    Nowadays, we don't see rulers rule by principles, rather, more we see profitability, advantage, benefit, a self centred and inward looking culture.  Which is suddenly looking more to becoming autocratic.     Hence, I have no doubt that under current circumstances, this lot will come to a grinding halt with a shock to those who lose power overnight.

Even then it is absolute madness to pay this kind of money for an hdb flat.

The problem is that when you go to a bank for a mortgage to buy the property, the bank want at least a 50-60 year balance AFTER the loan has been fully paid. So you actually need at least 75-80 years at the time of purchase... if people are unable to get a mortgage then you can only sell to cash buyers who are few and far between and will drive a hard bargain (there is a reason they have that much money in the first place.!) so basically the property value does not depreciate slowly as the lease remaining dwindles, its value suddenly "falls of a cliff" once people are no longer able to get a mortgage on it...
 
For historical reasons, Singapore is following the UK flat ownership and leasehold system where 99 year leases are also common. The UK had the same problem and this was solved by new legislation around 25 years ago that means any flat owner after they have owned a property for more than 2 years, has the legal right to add an additional 90 years to their lease if they want to. However this is not free, there is a valuation process and below about 70 years remaining, the premium to extend can be hefty. However it then allows the flat to be sold with a new long lease. As more and more flats age, I forsee that Singapore will eventually adopt a similar solution... https://www.lease-advice.org/advice-guide/lease-extension-getting-started/
