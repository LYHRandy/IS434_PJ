what was your deciding factor when you chose your HDB flat in your block ?
 
not talking about location as in road, but how you made your choices on the level and either corner or center of beside lift or staircase ?
 
all this - if you had a choice during your selection ?
 
I would hope to get a corner flat so only the door is the only accessible point of entry. so that I can keep my hall or room windows opened all the time without worry of my neighbors/stalkers walking past my unit and looking inside.

I believe if there is a choice, no one wants to buy a corridor unit de. But you also have to be careful when buying corner flat, since i notice some corner flat the windows in your house also faces the corridor. People might still able to see a bit of your house from the corridor area, even though your flat is a corner unit.

really depend on what u are allocated.
just choose the best stack u like lor.
 
My unit is just outside the lift. but compared to the other units of the same facing in the block. My living room and room windows don't directly face the other block which is directly opposite. 
The other opposite facing is facing the main road. So we opted for facing into the estate.
 
It's just the best we can make of it given our queue no.

go take a look at new HDB lah.
There's no more true corridor units that i've seen.
 
Usually one level will be broken up into segments of 2 units (you and your immediate neighbour), usually directly opposite your doors (or close to direct opposite) will be another segment of 2. Then each level either has 8-10 of such units depending on the block.
 
The only exception i've seen is in teban gardens whereby the 3room flats almost function like a point block. 4 units into a central space. then 2 clusters of 4
 
HDB knows people don't like people looking into house. So most units are like that. The only corridor units left are the new rental housing blocks u can still see long corridor with several units opening into the corridor. But even then i don't see windows when i drive past (though i haven't went up to see how they are configured).

The unit i chose is a corner unit so that there are windows facing the corridor.  The unit should have windows on opposite ends (eg. kitchen to living room) so that there is better airflow through.  Dun want a unit immediately next to the rubbish chut or the lift so less noise and mess.  Dun want too low floor to minimize pest and blockage of view.  Dun want a unit near a power substation cos kiasi.. Dun want a unit with a few steps leading to the main door cos using prams or wheelchairs will be difficult.. Dun wan a unit facing a major road cos will be noisy..

agree with most of your points. Living near a substation is a legit concern. Not kiasi.. 
I will also take note of the west sun as evening are the time we reach home. Don't wanna step into the house and a gust of warm air slapping my face when I open the main door.. Try to find a unit with N-S as the most prevalent wind are N-S.

i didn't choose my flat, it chose me (7th month scary story)     
 
  
 
ok not joking, i view my unit in late evening around 9pm, the owner probably only show me 50% of the house in dim light. 
 
after viewing i went down with the agent and pass him the deposit, never went back for 2nd viewing during day time, and few monthslater, i moved in.

Nowadays new bto not easy to find a good unit, esp if you are buying smaller flat like 2 or 3 rm flat. Usually they do not have very good facing, either they face the road or directly opposite other blocks. Getting bigger unit might have chance that the facing is better, like facing a park or greenery.
 
If buy resale flat, then maybe still can find a flat which meet your requirement. But sometimes also must depends on luck. I have a friend who buy a resale old type of 3 room, ended bought a corridor unit because during the time when they are sourcing for flat, no corner unit is selling.

depends on the land constraints. If u have a completely new BTO estate being built not surrounded by other older blocks, usually can get some with nicer views. My estate was surrounded by other much older blocks and the main road. So choice was quite limited. 
 
Non mature estate, some of the views can be decent. But of course maybe blocked in future by other developments.

I think they build the units facing depend on the type of flat. Like i said, usually you cannot find nice facing for 3 rm flat and below. Esp for 2 room flat, almost all the units facing main road, directly opposite other blocks or west sun direction.

We had SERS.  Moved in 7 years ago.
 
Wanted a high floor with a good view.
 
We got a choice through the draw to pick our flat on the final day and expected all high floors would be gone.
 
Luckily one left on high floor and it had a great view.
Could see 60 km into Malaysia. and the fireworks there at CNY etc.
 
Now all around has got 40 story blocks so view is restricted but luckily we seldom look at view anyway.
 
Flat is next to lift which has always been noisy but my study is next to lift and no one else really notices the noise.
 
Overall it's a fabulous location and close to all amenities, mall, MRT, bus station, wet markets, supermarkets etc
 
We were lucky as weren't expecting SERS.

so how did the selection process go when HDB ask you to choose your new bto flat ?
 
they give you a range of the blocks or one particular block ? any available floor and unit ? or they just give you a few units to choose from ?

My estate has a big drainage (river) towards the sea. When choosing the block, i already shortlist a couple of them which is beside the drainage.
When selecting the apartment, i choose one that can see the drainage from my mbr. Ironically, i want the service yard that is either facing sunrise or sunset to dry my clothes as i dont want to buy a dryer. 
Luckily my queue number is quite good and i managed to get the one i want. But unable to secure the aame unit on a higher floor.

Actually you can check out the layout of the cluster that you can choose. And can check online if the unit still available or not during the selection process for all the blocks in the cluster.

If your unit facing a big drainage, wouldnt it be quite noisy during raining? I remember last time stay in one hdb flat before, my block infront was a big longkang, during raining day could hear the water flowing down the longkang very loud.

If the cluster of flats not say many, then the chances of nearing the substation is high. Like you said, only thing to do is get higher units. Car parked near the substation have any problem ah?

Cars shouldn't be affected much against EMF.. But referring to an older thread, hybrid cars with batteries all around is something I would avoid totally.

so the selection and reservation is via online selection ? no need to go down personally to look see look see and then reserve on the spot ?
 
once you book online then its confirmed liow ? HDB cannot give to other ppl already ?
 
but by looking online, will they indicate corner or whatever location is the unit ?

You can check availability online before you go down. But whoever is queued ahead of you can still choose the unit.
 
So you should check avails, select and list down 5-20 that you want (by priority) then when you go down to do the selection, just go down your list until they have something available.

You need to go down to HDB on your actual day to select your flat. But you should check availability of the flats and also the process of the selection before the actual appointment.

Once the unit selection process, Hdb Everyday they will update online which units are available. So usually you will get a hard copy of all the units and prices and the stacks. So I just use pen and strike off the units one by one over the few days or weeks until your appointment. Online also have the information but I find it easier to look on hard copy. Especially if someone bought stack A 8th level but didn't buy same stack 9th floor. 
 
So while you wait for your appointment based on your queue no, you evaluate what options are left on that day. Prior night will be most of final elimination. So usually narrow down to final two or three list in case you are not the first case of the day.

For me, I try to choose a high floor corner unit, kitchen/yard where I hang clothes should have access to sunshine, and the whole place needs to be bright.
 
Best if the living room and bedrooms are unblocked.
 
Near staircase or lift doesn't matter to me.

House must be bright, no matter which part of the house. By right high floor unit would be brighter than lower floor unit, even the brightness at the corridor outside your house also would get affected by the level.
 
If you want a unit which is unblocked, usually the facing would be some road. Since the layout of bto nowadays all either face road or very close to other blocks. Old flats still might have chance to find unblocked unit or opposite block further away from your block.

Most times, units near the stairs always get new paint job outside the unit due to the behavior of your neighbors. Not your business but still kanna.

Not really. Maybe im on mid floor and sound of the rain will drown the sound of the flowing water. Its quite scary sometime to see the water almost full to the banks. Our drainage system is quite good actually.

Agree with you. I visited one unit recently at Sumang Walk, on the 10th level. Very good unobstructed river view!

Just look at the number of applicants....
You think you stand a chance or not? So many ppl with the same priorities. This is like a mini 4D. Those who get a number is as good as striking 4D.
4 to 6 times over-subscribe. On average 4-6 families fight for one unit. Tampines so popular.

If you are not given a queue number means no way you can get an appointment date to select flat liao. Lol. If you can get a queue number but exceeded the number of units, maybe still able to select the flat if many people before your queue give up. Anyway, being optimistic is good la.

True.... Not only priority.. But reserved units.
I was counting on the proximity factor to my parents place. The rest of priority factors is common.
 
Wife die die want near MRT... If not, can just select the sbf and be on our way already....

 
Tough lah. HDB has to give you discount if you successfully get to stay near your parents. You think will happen or not? 
They already kpkb making huge losses. They must be thinking, you might as well stay with your parents...can save even more. LoL...Just kidding.
 
Bto in mature estates has limited numbers. So far all bto projects in such areas are small scale. If you still have a number you still got chance. If no number, sorry bro, forget it and try try again. Still want near mrt siah....if kenna as good as striking 4D. What are the odds?

actually I was quite surprised at the number of available SBF flats in Tampines during the last sales launch … got one unit just a few floors below my friend who got his bto in his first application also !
 
But my wife don't want … keep saying her prayers will help us get the new BTO near MRT … but turns out her prayers not strong enough.

It is first time balloting for a hdb flat? Thats why she is still hoping for a miracle? 
 
Anyway, tampines not easy to get unless you are very lucky. Try balloting for a flat in yishun, chances higher? Lol.

My experience is as such -
 
Background: I was part of the RC in my area. My father is of the grassroots.
 
Balloting duration: 6 years
 
Process:
 
First ballot - Dawson. Queue no. 700+. Balloting for 5 Room.
Result - Failed (HDB SMSed to inform I wasn't able to go for selection cos oversubscribed)
The turn of events happened 2 weeks before the selection of flats at Dawson. I received the HDB big envelope package to select 5 room flat units at Dawson! My queue no is now 100+.
 
So I thought, heng ah. Fast forward to 1 week before the selection date. HDB SMSed me again to inform all units taken up, so I no need to go down again.
 
Second ballot - Queue no. 1000+
 
Third Ballot - exceed queue no.
 
Fourth Ballot - exceed queue no.
 
Fifth ballot - exceed queue no.
 
Sixth ballot - exceed queue no.
 
So, having believed that with every failed ballot, we should be getting closer to getting a flat, whatever was happening to us, didn't seem right.
 
Wife and I made the decision to approach her area MP (SKP) at the MPS. Went in, told him what has been happening for the past 6 years. He said he will help us by writing a letter.
 
We received his letter the next day. It read "Couple cannot get flat. Please assist."
 
Pissed off right? My wife, took that 'letter' and CC-ed to all the management of HDB, including CEO, Mah Bow Tan (I think it was still him), LHL and attention the email to SKP, thanking him for his effort in writing that 'letter'. Then, she listed down all the problems we faced again and mentioned that maybe we should highlight our plight in the media. The underlying trend then was couple annulling their marriage or given up their engagements because of these balloting for flat issues.
 
Next day, received an email from HDB, asked us to ballot for the next release at Punggol, or risk having our balloting chances reduced drastically, because it would mean that we had given up the chance to select the unit at this release.
 
LL loh. Put our names in for the ballot. Received queue no. 400+, for four room units. At HDB, we waited and waited, as the high floors were all taken up. When it was finally our turn, we had a choice of selected units on the 4th, 5th and 2nd floor.
 
So, we didn't really choose our HDB flat. It kinda chose us.
 
And no.  Grassroots doesn't necessarily mean higher chances.

If apply for flats in popular location really depends luck de, like buying 4D lo. Think nothing to do if you are RC member, stay near parents, first timer etc. If people really interested in staying popular location and yet no luck on bto, then the only way is to buy resale in that area but with a higher premium, no choice.

This one was for the BTO above clementi mall. So i think that time was about 550k-575k for the few balance 5-room flats available in 2010.
Right now it's worth 900+k  
 
Dawson also another one. That one even higher 600+k.
But dawson the 5 room flats i think (or it could be clementi heights), that the 5 room is smaller by 10 sqm compared to the usual 112 sqm nowadays.

And no.  Grassroots doesn't necessarily mean higher chances.
when my father was in the RC, they received a memo telling them that there were some reserved units at the new flats around our place (at discounted price also).
 
but my father already used up his two priority ques to buy our present and previous flat already … so no chance liow.
 
so basically, you still have to ballot among the RC backed applicants … if never get, really salty lor …
 
but my cousin got her flat in Dawson on first try with her husband - both first timers without backing (kid was on the way then).

We were fortunate when we went for balloting for flats at bukit merah in 2003.Market was bad and younger applicants were perhaps less gongho. We managed to pick a unit on very high floor (1 unit on top-floor was also available but we didn't pick that one cos next door neighbour was messy). It took another 3 years before all the units in that few blocks were fully sold. We wanted a 4 room flat but demand was stronger, so we picked a 5 room unit.

Just exercised OTP and submitted HDB resale application for my new place.
 
It ticked most of our boxes and on top of that we felt the asking price was a little on the low side.
 
Central location, 5 room 113sqm with decent layout, high floor #38, south facing, unblocked sea view, unrenovated, TOP in 2013.
 
Overall very happy to find the unit. We actually picked this one over some of the million-dollar units we saw at Pinnacle.

Actually my current place is at telok blangah drive, one of the old blocks near where Lala81 mentioned. The new blocks (telok blangah towers, TOP 2012) are about 200m away from me. Unfortunately that cluster of 3 blocks does not have 5-room units, largest is 4 room, great view from the high floors though.
 
New place is at Kim Tian and we paid somewhere around the mid-9s for it, so not a million-dollar hdb. I know 5 minutes away got people sold 4-room unit for over 1 mill, but i guess they're closer to the mrt.

You mean mid 900k? Wow..
 
Yes kim tian is close to tiong bahru mrt. 
 
Actually the one nearer to mrt should be havelock green  (or central..forgotten the name). Is near to tiong bahru station and the up coming havelock station.
 
Convenient as it is also near cte,aye,ecp
 
Also another plus point Kim tian vicnity can easily access to AH, SGH, NUH. Dont mean any malice. Is good where one need to visit for medical attention.

HDB flats unlike the past, today are much better built, not only design but quality.
 
Unfortunately, their sizes have reduced which may be a disadvantage for larger families.
 
80 plus % of our population lives in HDB, so something must be right.
 
Current flat choice:
 
1. Limited by choice.
2. Limited by budget.
3. Limited by needs.
4. Limited by racial quota.
5. Stepping stone for eventual moving to private condo or landed
6. Proximity to amenities, MRT station, work, school including in-laws.
 
Ultimately, it is different for everyone.

Keppel and Tanjang Pagar are going to be shifted to Tuas in a few years. I'm guessing they will be building more high rise condos in that space.
 

I think most of the blocks in the cluster are roughly N/S facing, so we have a view of keppel harbour+brani island but not tankjong pagar terminal. We are overlooking the starting section of the CTE/jln bukit merah flyover but traffic noise is very minimal at that height, plus there's a small park buffering the blocks from the highway. Interestingly enough from the kitchen we can see the SGH helipad, so i guess there is a restriction on tall buildings across the CTE which allows for the sound to disperse.
 
The only downside we forsee is the upcoming Silat Ave development that OUL won the land tender for. Not sure how high they'll go but our current 180-degree unobstructed view might eventually get partially blocked by that one. Our block is on elevated land so i'm guessing they'll need to go over 40 storeys to get in our way.

Keppel and Tanjang Pagar are going to be shifted to Tuas in a few years. I'm guessing they will be building more high rise condos in that space.
If high rise building is build, it would block the sea view at kim tian area.

I think most of the blocks in the cluster are roughly N/S facing, so we have a view of keppel harbour+brani island but not tankjong pagar terminal. We are overlooking the starting section of the CTE/jln bukit merah flyover but traffic noise is very minimal at that height, plus there's a small park buffering the blocks from the highway. Interestingly enough from the kitchen we can see the SGH helipad, so i guess there is a restriction on tall buildings across the CTE which allows for the sound to disperse.
 
The only downside we forsee is the upcoming Silat Ave development that OUL won the land tender for. Not sure how high they'll go but our current 180-degree unobstructed view might eventually get partially blocked by that one.

Yeah we frequent some of the places around yong siak street and tiong bahru in general and are quite familiar with the various cafes and restaurants. 
 
To answer some questions:
 
a. it's a resale unit from the open market. 
b. when i meant no reno done i meant it is very basic flat, all loose furniture and no built-in carpentry in the rooms. the kitchen is basic. great for us because we'll be ripping out everything and doing a full reno anyway. 
c. the boon tiong road cluster was the one that broke 1 mill for a 4-room flat.
d. why pay almost 1 mill for a hdb instead of getting a condo? location, size and unwillingness to commit to a heavy mortgage since we're both entering our early 40s

either Kim Tian or Telok Blangah are both near to CDB and town, esp convenient if either of you work there. No need car, buses are already convenient. I prefer Telok Blangah Dr for more serenity though not as convenient as Kim Tian.
 
At your Telok Blangah Dr place, the wanton noodle at the food centre there is good. Long Q though.

I find kim tian still not say very near MRT, tiong baru plaza that area is nearer. Near to cbd and town doesnt mean taking buses are convenient. Best is the area also near to MRT. As some places also near to town but not near to MRT, only depend on buses which is not very convenient.
 
Telok blangah indeed more serenity, esp if your area is near to the park. But buses at telok blangah quite limited and long. Unless you are staying near the CCL, if you stay near the safra side, going in and out of the estate also not very convenient.

As long as it is within you family budget than I would say a good buy. Is a cheap price to pay for a change in lifestyle compare to uproot and migrating whole family oversea. Every relocation (estate to estate) will amount to a certain degree of change in life style. Keppel and Tanjang Pagar are going to be shifted to Tuas in a few years. I'm guessing they will be building more high rise condos in that space.The shifting of PSA to Tuas will free up all those port coastline. From pandan through to the west coast, Santosa and down to MBS..they going to convert that stretch into something like marina regatta.

Depends on your lifestyle and where your relatives and friends stay...
 
Everytime i meet my friends or go back to my parents place, i need to drive 25-30mins one way in light traffic just to get there cos i stay in the north near my work and in-laws.
I don't mind driving, but it does sorta reduce the chances to meet up. I only see my parents once a week.

Kim tian to TB plaza there are no sheltered walkway. It take around 10 mimutes walking distance to the mrt station. 
As for buses plenty to go chinatown/Orchard vicnity.
 
Quiet and serene..hmm pretty subjective here. Telok blangah near to many green. Cooling and quiet I reckon. As for Kim tian is more laid back when come to weekend. Seeing AMTL cycling...Cafe..graffiti on some of the wall..tourist taking picture...wedding photography shoot..even community centre also organise those walkaround tour.

It is inevitable. Most people in other countries only meet their parents once a year if not less.

Yeah likely the Silat Ave project will block abit of the view once completed. For the rest of the waterfront, really depends on what they build when they eventually clear out Brani terminal, too early to say and we don't really have any control over what happens there.
 
No need to think so much about lifestyle change as our old place and new place are only 10 minutes apart. Friends, family, workplace and most clients are within 15 minutes, only diff is that some are even closer now. The only change is that our neighbourhood mall will switch from vivo to tbp or gwc and we will lose the easy access to the circle line. This is the main reason our search was limited to the stretch from commonwealth/holland down to duxton, location was non-negotiable.
 
Have to admit, the new place has less public transport options within a short walk. I think only one bus route services kim tian road itself, for the rest will need to walk out to jln bukit merah or tiong bahru road. As mentioned, the mrt is about 10 minutes away and not covered. I think the upcoming havelock mrt will be about the same. Fortunately public transport accessibilty is not a priority for us.
 
I don't want to say too much about the financials, but we're not taking a full mortgage and the monthly is very manageable for us. Part of the reason is that we plan to take our feet off the gas pedal in the next few years where work is concerned and go into some sort of semi-retirement.

Agreed, if need to drive 25 min or more to get to friends or parents place, quite tiring. Although some people might find not far since driving. For me i also dont like to drive 30 mins to get to one place, maybe age catching up liao. Lol. If the traffic is heavy along the way, it really makes me headache.

1 good thing about Kim tian is that it is near to the tiong Bahru 4 storey buildings. On a breezy cloudy day, just sitting on the benches between the blocks is pretty refreshing. The pace slows down considerably. I have not walked around there for some years but there used to be many friendly neighborhood cats lounging around as well. 
And loo's scissors curry rice is sublime.

Actually buses not bad if there are many buses to take. If not imagine if your area no mrt and only limited buses running, and perhaps only one and only bus to take you out of the estate, during peak hours not fun and good at all lo. And remember buses subjected to traffic, weather and road conditions. Buses might ended wait very long or crowded.

HDB flats unlike the past, today are much better built, not only design but quality.
 
Unfortunately, their sizes have reduced which may be a disadvantage for larger families.
 
80 plus % of our population lives in HDB, so something must be right.
 
Current flat choice:
 
1. Limited by choice.
2. Limited by budget.
3. Limited by needs.
4. Limited by racial quota.
5. Stepping stone for eventual moving to private condo or landed
6. Proximity to amenities, MRT station, work, school including in-laws.
 
Ultimately, it is different for everyone.

 
many new towns have very little amenities ..... I dont know which clown do the planning . Instead of planning HOME for people .. they just plan where one sleep

Again wordplay. 
"There is still value in the property. It is not going to go to zero when you are 85,” Mr Heng stressed."
 
$100k is a value. $10 is also a value. Declining value, is still a value.
 
But the HDB is gonna have zero value when its age is 99 years.

Still trying to throw smoke with that own vs rent debate.
 
Can HDB clarify by showing their sample agreement? If someone "buys" a BTO, is it a tenancy agreement or sales and purchase agreement?

He didn’t say remaining value > purchase price.
Before the lease runs to zero at 99 yrs old, there should be residual value. 
At least you get to stay there, hopefully the unit is  paid up & so rent free.

many new towns have very little amenities ..... I dont know which clown do the planning . Instead of planning HOME for people .. they just plan where one sleepIt's not that they have few amenities, it's that small shops don't find it easy to survive. Beyond something like small bakeries, barber or hair salon, small supermarkets which are now built into small estates. The times of a neighbourhood center with like 20-30 shops are gone. Many of them are just barely getting by. Some areas even have many shuttered shops. 
Shopping habits, few stay home housewives, lack of home cooking, deliveroo food panda etc have caused the demise.

I mean one still needs a place to stay.
And you will either be renting or paying a mortgage.
So if you paid up the mortgage (regardless HDB or private), you live inside without needing to pay any rent.
Whether what you paid in total (in rent or mortgage) will exceed purchase price, well ... nobody can guarantee. Can just tell you got value left.

Our garment got foresight on this one. The newer hdb blocks are silver ready, can be converted to elderly care easily in times of need which is not too far distant. Just like how they designed the mscp and kpe which are ahem...ever ready.
 
But the vision of an underground mini city...with the rising sea level...sprinkler leak...I’m not too sure about that one.

Location is still the most important factor as after a long day at work, I do not want to take the MRT then change to a bus just to get home. Although my current place is still far from the city centre, but at least I'm staying a 3 mins walk from the MRT station.

When we chose our HDB, we were in the RFS scheme. They scrapped that and introduced BTO. That time, 2001, only three BTO areas to choose from, CCK, Punggol and Sembawang. We looked and decided both Punggol and CCK out. So Sembawang. 
 
We both decided to go for 5 rooms flat cos both of us grew up in small flats. We liked to have more space. Same as you guys, chose the NS facing. Wanted high level but queue till our turn, only left mid level so just take it. All the flats here no have windows at the corridor. 
 
I still like my place even though it is far from everything except going to JB. This would be my final home i hoped so.

Agreed, no matter where you stay, stay near mrt less than 7 mins walk is important. It reduce lots of time by no need to take any bus. Taking bus really wasted lots of time, the inconsistent waiting time and overcrowded bus etc. I have been through this in all the places that i have stay, really wasted lots of time taking bus.

just submitted my second application for this month's SBF exercise.
 
i thought that when HDB show you the balance unsold flats, you can actually chose which one you want to apply.
 
but apparently that is not the case.
 
i was just led through an open application process, paid the $10 fee and then told the "ballot results will be out in July 2019'.
 
so when one is successful, one will be given a queue number to then go and chose from the balance pool.
 
** so what happen to the apply today and get results tomorrow thingy ? if not for this exercise, then it should have been June .... but now they say results in July ?

I just need to say something about the use of the word stay. Almost all Singaporeans misuse the word. It should be “where do you live?” And not “where do you stay?” Live is permanent whereas stay is temporary. You stay in a hotel, but you live at toa payoh.

just submitted my second application for this month's SBF exercise.
 
i thought that when HDB show you the balance unsold flats, you can actually chose which one you want to apply.
 
but apparently that is not the case.
 
i was just led through an open application process, paid the $10 fee and then told the "ballot results will be out in July 2019'.
 
so when one is successful, one will be given a queue number to then go and chose from the balance pool.
 
** so what happen to the apply today and get results tomorrow thingy ? if not for this exercise, then it should have been June .... but now they say results in July ?
balance flat is not like buying off the shelves, still have to ballot cos there might be dozens of people want it too.Singaporeans can argue that no place is permanent here. Everything is temporary.actually we only stay on earth for a fixed period of time, some stay longer some short stay.

So you need to indicate which one you want to chose before balloting? And if cannot get a queue number, you are not allow to chose other place liao even it is still available?

I am now applying to get q number to be able to select a balance flat later. So no difference from a new application except it's for the balance flats of a certain estate. Results will only be out in July ... So until then,  nothing happens.

One choice of estate and one choice of your of flat only.
 
If you get q number,  then you can choose  from whatever balance flats available in that whole estate.

balance flat is not like buying off the shelves, still have to ballot cos there might be dozens of people want it too.
 
I think most ppl will not know that... Coz they will think since they can view the exact balance unit,  they can choose to apply for that particular unit.  
But that is not the case lor. 
 
Even my friend who just got his keys asked me to apply the balance unit in his block!!

Like this chances might not be high if that estate balance number of flats are limited. Cause usually many people apply for balance of flat de, maybe even that estate only left 10 units.Just like applying for new bto project lor ... 50/50

What you are thinking is "Re-offer of Balance Flats" which will come after this SOB exercise.
 
This SOB still need ballot and etc... 
 
Applicants simply need to apply for the ROF exercise by registering their particulars and paying the administration fee. Unlike the SBF exercise, applicants need not indicate the estate location and type of apartment size that they are interested in. Instead, all successful applicants will be shortlisted using a computer ballot and get a chance to select a HDB flat, subject to their allocated queue number and availability of the unit. HDB indicates that ballot results will be made known to applicants 1 week after the close of the ROF exercise.

The latest SBF got 40th floor 5-room until at City Vue @ Henderson, going for 809k. Last year got 20-something floor unit in this stack which i was considering, but tried luck by applying for dawson instead. Should be quite a nice view from this unit since it's elevated land.

At the bottom they indicated keys are available... But completion of sale in Feb 2020. 
I am still OK for this time range.
 
BTW,  I noticed when I went to my friend's new bto,  the car park barriers not up yet... But many moved in already... So they get free parking for how long?

No carpark barriers doesnt mean free parking hor. Lol.

Looks like ROF SOB better. If can get a queue number, can have a buffet choice. Unlike SOB if cannot get a queue number, then have to re-apply again.

Reading through the latest pages of this thread reminds me of my successful SBF (Sale of Balance Flats) exercise recently.
 
I entered the Nov 2018 SBF exercise hoping to get a BTO which is scheduled to be ready sometime in 2020/2021. Applying a BTO-BTO wasnt the choice for me as I would only be able to get my keys around 2023. As I needed to collect my keys around 2020/2021, SBF-BTO was the way to go for me.
 
I applied under the Married Child Parent Scheme (MCPS) and was lucky enough to obtain queue position number 1* out of 77 units of flats on offer. Based on some of the posts listed above, yes, the estate and room type will have to be selected during the application of the SBF exercise. For example, if I have opted for a 5-room SBF unit in Sengkang, in relation to my case, it would mean that I can pick 1 among the 77 5-room units in Sengkang and I am number 1* in the queue.
 
I have been monitoring the SBF and Re-offer of Balance Flats (ROF) exercises since early 2018 hoping to get a BTO of my choice (estate, number of rooms, price and completion date were my considerations). The first few exercises were a bit demoralizing as none matched my requirements. Only the ones listed in SBF Nov 2018 caught my eye and here I am waiting to sign the agreement for lease. 
 
Fyi, SBF and ROF are launched together with fresh BTO exercises every 3 or 4 months. SBF and ROF will be launched alternately. For example, as May 2019 compromises of BTO + SBF exercise, Sep 2019 will compromise of BTO + ROF exercise.
 
Hope I have cleared a doubt or 2 for those who are currently going through this journey.
 
Happy selecting!

Some of these flats for sales of balance exercise are almost completed or halfway done. 
 
Hence, the prices are higher than when originally launched. Not fair it may seem as they are left overs n u pay more but I suppose u can’t really compare as waiting time to completion is much shorter n as we all know time is money. This more for those who need a flat quicker n don’t mind paying premium.

i would say confirmed can select a flat since your queue number is within the total number of flats available to choose. Now must see whether you can get the flooring, the blk and the facing of the flat you want. Congrats, finally you got your bto in the estate you want.

Poultry-rearing controversy: HDB has rights to impose rules as “landlords”, according to NParks, confirming HDB “owners” are tenants?Danisha Hakeem 2019-07-30 HousingThe Housing and Development Board (HDB) has the right to impose rules against HDB owners who rear poultry in their flats without prior written consent, said National Parks Board (NParks).NParks told TODAY in response to queries regarding the case of one of Singapore’s leading chicken rearers Eric Woo that HDB owners “are also subject to rules of their landlord, which may or may not allow the keeping of poultry within their managed areas”.Mr Woo, a 48-year-old private science tutor, was forced to relocate five of his chickens after HDB officers informed him that poultry rearing in HDB flats, even for hobbyist purposes, is not permitted. The officers had reportedly received a tip-off regarding Mr Woo’s activities, according to TODAY.However, Mr Woo told TODAY that he has “looked high, low, sideways”, and still did “not find the HDB regulation that states non-commercial poultry keeping is not allowed”, adding that two of his friends who had received the same warning came to a similar conclusion.While Mr Woo said he had noted that NParks stated on its website’s “Information on Bird Flu” page poultry-keeping is illegal in HDB flats, he also cited the Animals and Birds Act, which states that individuals may keep up to 10 birds “in any premises”.“Since when does NParks have jurisdiction over HDB?” He questioned.Responding to Mr Woo’s claims regarding not being able to find explicit rules that prohibit the keeping of poultry in HDB flats, HDB told today that it has “a 10-page memorandum of lease document that every homeowner has to sign under the Land Titles Act, which has a clause stating that a lessee cannot keep any animal, bird, fish or insect without HDB’s written consent”.However, HDB has in recent years allowed the keeping of small pets, such as small dogs, fishes and rabbits in HDB flats.Nonetheless, NParks’ confirmation that HDB is the “landlord” while HDB “owners” are in fact tenants who are subjected to the rules of their landlord, supports what licensed real estate agent with International Property Advisor Pte Ltd and co-founder of HugProperty.com, Mr Ku Swee Yong, said back in 2018 about the notions and preconceptions regarding ownership of residential property in Singapore, particularly that of HDB flats.Mr Ku had argued that it would be more beneficial for Singaporeans to “acknowledge that HDB flat buyers are lessees, not owners”, and that it would be more apt and accurate to change the usual terms to describe HDB flats – that is, from “buy”, “sell” and “owner”, to “lease”, “transfer lease” and “tenant”.To illustrate his point, he said that many Singaporeans tend to base their residential property investment on the perception that their HDB flat is “an asset whose value must appreciate”.He argued that such a move is “not necessarily the wisest decision with a rapidly ageing population, where an increasing number of deaths of baby boomers will add significant supply of old resale flats to the market”.He suggested that the perception is further bolstered by the government’s act of perpetuating “this narrative of home ownership, when in fact those who pay for a new HDB flat are lessees for its 99-year term” through “websites and official publications”.Following Mr Ku’s comments, Minister for National Development Mr Lawrence Wong rejected his claims that HDB flat buyers are not owners but are “tenants” in practice during his speech at the HDB’s Peak Forum for property experts at HDB Hub.Minister Wong said that such a claim is “factually and legally wrong”, as the same principle of ownership throughout the stipulated period of lease applies to all buyers of leasehold residential property, regardless whether the property is private or public.

Poultry-rearing controversy: HDB has rights to impose rules as âlandlordsâ, according to NParks, confirming HDB âownersâ are tenants?
Danisha Hakeem 2019-07-30 Housing
 
The Housing and Development Board (HDB) has the right to impose rules against HDB owners who rear poultry in their flats without prior written consent, said National Parks Board (NParks).
 
NParks told TODAY in response to queries regarding the case of one of Singaporeâs leading chicken rearers Eric Woo that HDB owners âare also subject to rules of their landlord, which may or may not allow the keeping of poultry within their managed areasâ.
 
Mr Woo, a 48-year-old private science tutor, was forced to relocate five of his chickens after HDB officers informed him that poultry rearing in HDB flats, even for hobbyist purposes, is not permitted. The officers had reportedly received a tip-off regarding Mr Wooâs activities, according to TODAY.
 
However, Mr Woo told TODAY that he has âlooked high, low, sidewaysâ, and still did ânot find the HDB regulation that states non-commercial poultry keeping is not allowedâ, adding that two of his friends who had received the same warning came to a similar conclusion.
 
While Mr Woo said he had noted that NParks stated on its websiteâs âInformation on Bird Fluâ page poultry-keeping is illegal in HDB flats, he also cited the Animals and Birds Act, which states that individuals may keep up to 10 birds âin any premisesâ.
 
âSince when does NParks have jurisdiction over HDB?â He questioned.
 
Responding to Mr Wooâs claims regarding not being able to find explicit rules that prohibit the keeping of poultry in HDB flats, HDB told today that it has âa 10-page memorandum of lease document that every homeowner has to sign under the Land Titles Act, which has a clause stating that a lessee cannot keep any animal, bird, fish or insect without HDBâs written consentâ.
 
However, HDB has in recent years allowed the keeping of small pets, such as small dogs, fishes and rabbits in HDB flats.
 
Nonetheless, NParksâ confirmation that HDB is the âlandlordâ while HDB âownersâ are in fact tenants who are subjected to the rules of their landlord, supports what licensed real estate agent with International Property Advisor Pte Ltd and co-founder of HugProperty.com, Mr Ku Swee Yong, said back in 2018 about the notions and preconceptions regarding ownership of residential property in Singapore, particularly that of HDB flats.
 
Mr Ku had argued that it would be more beneficial for Singaporeans to âacknowledge that HDB flat buyers are lessees, not ownersâ, and that it would be more apt and accurate to change the usual terms to describe HDB flats â that is, from âbuyâ, âsellâ and âownerâ, to âleaseâ, âtransfer leaseâ and âtenantâ.
 
To illustrate his point, he said that many Singaporeans tend to base their residential property investment on the perception that their HDB flat is âan asset whose value must appreciateâ.
 
He argued that such a move is ânot necessarily the wisest decision with a rapidly ageing population, where an increasing number of deaths of baby boomers will add significant supply of old resale flats to the marketâ.
 
He suggested that the perception is further bolstered by the governmentâs act of perpetuating âthis narrative of home ownership, when in fact those who pay for a new HDB flat are lessees for its 99-year termâ through âwebsites and official publicationsâ.
 
Following Mr Kuâs comments, Minister for National Development Mr Lawrence Wong rejected his claims that HDB flat buyers are not owners but are âtenantsâ in practice during his speech at the HDBâs Peak Forum for property experts at HDB Hub.
 
Minister Wong said that such a claim is âfactually and legally wrongâ, as the same principle of ownership throughout the stipulated period of lease applies to all buyers of leasehold residential property, regardless whether the property is private or public.
 
Another lazy shot with the least effort. The never-say-die spirit prevails.

Just wondering if chances of getting into a popular school is higher if your registered address is nearer to the school?  
 
I mean I read it's priority for those staying within 2km if the school.... But will those staying within 1km have more priority?

How is your flat selection so far? Your turn yet?
next month … coz my current flat is just walking distance (- 1km to my preferred school) whereas the project I am considering is almost 2km from the school.
 
my son's P1 reg will be next year … so if distance really plays such a big part, then I might consider delaying my move.

	In your HLE, did it state for 5 room or Any type?


	If it is specifically for 5 room, you'll have to get the HLE amended.

	Maybe you cannot downgrade since you have already applied the type of flat you want?!

	Best is to call up HDB and get the right answers from them.


	Since your HLE is for any type, shouldn't be any issue. Better check with them.

	Finally moved in last weekend, cos no choice had to handover my old flat to the buyer. Reno not completed yet cos of issues here and there, so wifey and me on leave this week to jagah the house while the contractors come and go (and make those on the spot decisions). It's been a long wait and we're still not fully unpacked because of the ongoing work but still feels good to be here and fingers crossed the work should be finished by Monday.

	This might be the forever home so no need to think about selling. Buying at this type of pricing means there is very little potential for the upside if want to sell later on.

	Thanks! A few minor things left for the contractors to sort out but they'll be doing another clean-up tomorrow. Yeah i've been coming to Tuan Yuan on and off since they first opened. I remember they were handing out their business cards towards the end of their tenure at Keppel. So happy to have BKT "downstairs".

	asked my best friend and it told me to download a "cancellation form", fill it up and then sent it back to HDB. Cited the new EHG as a reason.


	just sent it a moment ago … will try for the next BTO project in Tampines in November.


	all this just depends on luck, I guess … so I told myself, get  = good, don't get = I still have a roof over my head. so just take it easy.


	whilst asking my best friend, it also told me that the HDB boss said that more than 900 people gave up the selection also. I think he just stopped short of saying "beggars can't be choosers".


	well, I worked damn hard for my money and I am not going to spend it on a long term home for my family if we are not going to like it.
