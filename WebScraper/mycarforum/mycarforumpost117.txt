	No 70-year lease for new HDB flats

 
Tuesday, Nov 04, 2014
Rachel Au-Yong
My Paper



The Housing Board is not going to introduce the option of a shorter lease of 70 years for first-time buyers.
First-timers who want such flats can turn to the resale market, where they are still eligible for housing grants, National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan said in Parliament yesterday.
He did not believe that demand for such flats would be strong.
Mr Khaw was replying to Marine Parade GRC MP Seah Kian Peng, who had asked the ministry to consider offering new flats with a 70-year lease alongside new ones with the current 99-year lease.

5 things to know about HDB's Lease Buyback scheme
 

 
Mr Seah argued that home prices would be more affordable with shorter leases.
Disagreeing, Mr Khaw gave two reasons why demand would be weak.
First, the upfront cost HDB would incur for a 70-year lease would be the same as that for a 99-year lease.
Second, owing to the time value of money and the fact that flats with shorter leases tend to depreciate faster, the reduced price of a flat would not be directly proportional to the shortened lease.
"In fact, it is significantly higher," Mr Khaw said. "The fact is that we price new flats on a 99-year lease to be highly affordable for first-time buyers."


HDB enhances upgrading programmes
 

 

 
With significant housing grants, first-timers with a monthly household income of $1,000 can afford a new two-room flat in a non-mature estate, while those who earn $4,000 a month should be able to afford a four-room home.
"They can do so with little or no out-of-pocket cash," he said.
HDB buys land from the Singapore Land Authority on a 105-year lease, enabling the Board to build and sell new flats with a 99-year lease.
However, it offers flats with shorter leases to serve the needs of specific buyers, Mr Khaw said, citing studio apartments, which are sold on a 30-year lease to senior citizens as their retirement homes.
He also assured Mr Seah that he would "keep (his) options open", by perhaps offering an entire block of flats with a 70-year lease should the need arise.
"But at the moment, I doubt it," he said.

Hang on.....................
 
 
Can we have 999 years flats? I guess the upfront cost will still be the same right? At least I can tell my kids or grand children that I will be passing something of value to them

U will need to give mature estate some premium price if no house in Jurong and sambawang no taker. Then Tpy become over subscribe.
 
This is actually an ideal strategy to differential mature and new estate.

I remember when i got my Sembawang flat 15 years ago.
 
5-room (NEW) cost 200k only. 111sqm.
 
Now we get a smaller flat but pay more than double the pricing!!!!!

Apex only left low floor....probably for malays and other nationality only.
 
Sembawang still got penty high floors to choose........

Fully agree to NO 70-year lease. In fact, 99-year is too short. Should make it 888-year unit since we love #8. I am happy our ministar didn't soften due to pressures internally from their own and externally.
 
It won't make flats affordable; it will get worse as the per year depreciation will be much higher, just like mickey mouse unit versus full size condo.... Although mickey mouse unit may be cheaper in dollar terms, per square foot, it may be much higher than a proper size unit.
 
Gahment just need to sell us cheaper, that's it.

Ya exactly.
 
Remember you need to be married to buy flat before 35, so living together also double the cost and expenses. If your combined salary less than 2k (not unheard of), and half of it goes to the flat, then how? Eat grass ah?

we are returning it to gahment at end of 99-year lease. By then, the land could already be a gold mine. Who knows there's oil reserve down under. In a way, we are helping our gahment to safeguard the land for free. So, how can it be raiding the reserve? Shouldn't gahment pay us to land-squad the estate instead?
 
Hahahaha... just dream on....

Worse when u get married. Ur grant suddenly is reduce... Single actually have more grant per pax as compare to married couple. It's only an advantage if u marry young. IF old. The gahmen seem to tell me buy two hdb flat first then get married.

What to do?
 
Normally people look forward to buy properties as a legacy but in Singapore, most of the buying is just for 99 years.
 
Nothing to give to children. So why have kids?

What is Seah Kian Peng thinking???  As it is, HDB flats are being sold at obscene profit. Forget about existing flat dwellers.  Resale flats prices can always be tweaked to suit various situations.  It is a matter of putting their minds together.  Afterall, aren't they paid $$$Millions? He should be asking Cow to reduce the prices of HDB flats for 1st time buyers so that these ordinary Singapore citizens can afford a basic home as well as have some $$$ for their retirement.
Surely there are better candidates who can be better MP than such like Seah Kian Peng who probably got into parliament via the back door?  He doesn't need to try to be noble making such ridiculous suggestion for the sake of reducing HDB selling price.. 
The mentality of todays' MPs and ministers leaves much to be desired.

To be honest.. I am happy with what he was doing until this thing come out and I see "vote pulling policy" and become disgusted.
 
Just need hdb to sell bto at affordable price. Re-sale let it float. This will earn them all the vote they one. Rather then now.. Please one side and pissed off the rest.

at the end of 99-year lease, do you think you can get a cent back? You will be lucky if gahment didn't ask you to cough out $$$ to demolish and make good the land to bare.  
 
It "appreciates" because someone sells and makes a profit out of it. But, oneday someone will "hop" the "depreciation" mortar.
