If the other major cities like beijing, shanghai or guangzhou start, then it represents a major problem.

It's about time the property market makes an adjustment. It's been going sky high since 4-5 years ago. China will be one of the biggest hit as many spent money like no tomorrow including buying of properties.

Was wondering so many many many apartments and offices built for last 10 years and in China everyday a hotel is built. 
 
Even though they had great big population and biggest transmigration in the world, it doesnt represent people want to live in apartments except for big cities shanghai, beijing, nanjing and guanzhou when landed house really super expensive.
 
Maybe this is the bubble that going to burst

Chart of the Day: Here's how high Singapore banks' loans to China soared
But this isn't a threat, analyst says.
According to Maybank Kim Eng, limited lending to clients in China to fund their domestic needs. Unlike domestic banks, Singapore banks have been very selective in their lending in China.
This is not surprising as they have relatively smaller balance sheets and their lending and deposit franchises are not as well recognised as their local counterparts’.
Here's more from Maybank Kim Eng:
Moreover, Chinese corporates do not usually deal with small foreign players like Singapore banks for their longer-term funding requirements due to the latter’s inability to price their products as competitively as the large Chinese banks.
Recent loan growth driven by short-term and safer trade loans. Trade loans are inherently safer as they are short term in nature with an average duration of six months.
We understand that 70% of DBS’s trade loans to China are of six-month duration. A short duration means banks are able to reduce their exposure to trade loans quickly, if required.
We also note that the majority of such loans are backed by bank guarantees. Based on our channel checks, 50% of DBS’s total trade loans of SGD50b (+28% YoY) at end-2013 were backed by bank guarantees.
We also take comfort in the fact that DBS has maintained stringent lending standards in China by focusing on the right market segment culled from a list of internally-generated prospective clients of 1,000 Chinese companies which are considered as long-term winners in China.

As far as real estate property is concern, broadly, there are three types of Singaporeans.
 
Type 1 - Those who have invested in property during the low time, have grown their wealth, and hopping the property prices will continue to grow higher and higher.
 
Type 2 - Those who realized they have missed the boat, now cures and swear, hopping the entire economy will collapse, so they can get a second chance.
 
Type 3 - Those who still in the ancient mind set that believe in investment is a waste of money.  Any spending from their saving is a sin, they still believe in hiding money under the billow is the best.
 
 
Type 3 is the majority of the entire population, most of them don't even make it to know about MCF forum.
 
Type 2 will dig out all the bad news about property market, hopping it will come true.
 
Type 1, quietly cursing the type 2 .........

That bull run is over once China slows, unless India can take up the slack.  Which is unlikely because it is a democracy!

YANLORD ACQUIRES 171,200 SQM GFA PRIME RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
SITE IN SUZHOU FOR RMB1.35 BILLION
 Yanlord acquires a 171,200 square metre (sqm) gross floor area (GFA) prime

 Ideally situated for the development of a prime residential development, the project

Ghost cities or not .. Hangzhou cost of living is lower than Shanghai, rent is also lower, population is smaller than Shanghai though its just 2-hours away by high speed rail, but has long been known to be a rather speculative property market. Probably market adjustment is timely.
 
One could compare it to Iskandar and Singapore.. LOL. Except quality of living in Hangzhou is certainly much better than Johor.

Point is if he has 15B exposure to China property and reduces it to 3B, maybe a collapse is imminent.

I'm not saying that he has 15B in China.
 
I'm asking you if you knew his exposure to China.
 
Then the figure you quoted 3B of property disposal becomes a lot more meaningful, right?
 
Yes, 3B is a lot of money but if we can't compare it against his property exposure in China, it's like swatting flies in the dark.

I'm not saying that he has 15B in China.
 
I'm asking you if you knew his exposure to China.
 
Then the figure you quoted 3B of property disposal becomes a lot more meaningful, right?
 
Yes, 3B is a lot of money but if we can't compare it against his property exposure in China, it's like swatting flies in the dark.

 
Sometimes I ask a question if I don't know what I'm talking about just to pretend to be knowledgeable or look smart

In that case he wouldn't be selling right?
Forbes says he net worth is $31 billion, it's 10% not 5%...
Forbes wrong again, you right?

 
his net worth was said to be $31 billion..............that is his personal net worth??
 
$3billion sold is by his family???
 
what is the combine net worth of his family??..........

target buyers for property above RM$1M are mainly sporeans
actually, RM$1M is the new poor property in iskandar ... not simi high end
 

"There is a lot of money out there right now looking for investments in property, so the countries where it becomes easier to invest, where there are less tax regulations, the money is going to go to those kinds of places," he said.On the other hand, Singapore's cooling measures have effectively reduced the percentage of foreign property buyers just like what happened in Hong Kong, where expatriates are still subject to a 15 percent tax."Going back two-and-a-half years, 17 percent of all property transactions in Singapore were from non-Singaporeans. As of the third quarter of last year it had dropped to seven percent, so that could be down to the additional buyers' stamp duty. It could be down to economic reasons as well," said Batt.Meanwhile, the RM1 million minimum price threshold for foreign buyers in Malaysia is expected to impact investors who bought properties below that amount in Johor."The reason being, from 1 May, overseas buyers can only buy at one million ringgit and above. Let's say you are Singaporean and you have purchased a property in Johor state for RM750,000, there has not been that much capital appreciation yet. Let's say you need to get rid of it fairly quickly for one reason or another, you can only sell to a Malaysian below one million and, honestly, there are not that many Malaysians buying at that kind of price level right now so you could be stuck with something," he added.Nevertheless, the latest ruling does not cover the Medini area in Iskandar, even though it has already taken effect in Penang and Kuala Lumpur.Overseas real estate investments tend to flow into countries with fewer tax regulations, according to Andrew Batt, International Group Editor of PropertyGuru in a recent interview with Channel NewsAsia.

There are always warning indicators:
 
a. manic buying in the markets
 
b. prices breaking historical highs
 
c. all time low borrowing costs
 
d. huge amounts of liquidity in the system
 
e. large supply in pipeline
 
f. widespread moral hazard
 
These factors conspire to create an unsustainable situation where buying is led by primal instincts of greed and fear, and not by demand grounded in the two critical pillars of utility and affordability.
 
Without the two pillars, the demand is temporal, fuelled only by leverage and speculation.
 
Once the tools of leverage have been largely disabled, the demand ebbs rapidly and creates forces that are directly opposite of the present situation:
 
a. manic selling in the markets
 
b. prices breaking historical lows
 
c. all time high borrowing costs
 
d. limited amounts of liquidity in the system
 
These then become a vicious cycle and produces a negative chain reaction of fear-driven asset selling and consequentially falling prices.
 
Like a pendulum, the capitalist financial markets repeatedly gyrate between greed and fear, between manic buying and hysterical selling.

The consumer's biggest tool of leverage is financing provided to them by financial institutions such as banks.
 
Post-2009, two main factors converged and fed upon each other: increasing of money supply via quantitative easing (QE1) and lowering of lending rates from central banks to financial institutions. 
 
Due to the high levels of fear prevalent in the markets at that time, financial institutions across the world initially were reluctant to borrow from the central banks in spite of the lowered interest rates.
 
The game-changer came in the form of public back-stops provided by the government via the Treasury and the Federal Reserve in which they provided guarantees for investors who were adventurous enough. 
 
As fears at that point had been largely contained to the corporate world, sufficient confidence existed in the markets to allow these back-stops to function as powerful magnets for the risk-takers.
 
Those with the first-mover advantage naturally benefited the most at the turning point of the markets. Besides being highly leveraged on intoxicatingly-low interest rates, asset costs had plummeted in the months preceding QE1.
 
As more of these risk-takers swooped in like vultures to snap out the highly-depressed assets, fear abated across the board and greed dominated the smart money segment quickly.
 
Within weeks, smart money moved in to acquire the most valuable of prime assets in all aspects of the markets - equities, properties, etc. Greed spread like wildfire amongst the investment bankers and fund-managers.
 
At the same time, the burgeoning money supply began to overflow the banks of the top-tier money channels. Big corporations benefited from loans that were now beginning to look highly attractive.
 
Boards of directors realised that they could benefit from doing the same as the smart money - borrowing cheaply to buy up assets with once out-of-reach prices.
 
Greed drove speculation activity which in turn turned the creaky wheels of the battered financial world.
 
Like thick grease melting in the heat of day, cheap money (lots of it) flowed into the cracks and became accessible to the lower rungs of society - smaller corporations at first, and then eventually the consumers.
 
Retail investors' confidence were boosted by thawing financial quarterly reports and of course fast-recovering asset prices.
 
Wave after wave, they came - the smarter and more informed ones snapping up piece after piece of assets, mostly through direct funding.
 
With each wave, the numbers swelled. The biggest waves of buying were unleashed when the man-in-the-street began to dip his toes and eventually his entire foot into the simmering markets. 
 
Before long, the massive buying turned these markets red-hot. Prices had gone sky-high, breaking historical levels.
 
Yields began to fall quickly and that triggered even more buying as the end-users were fed the message of fear - that inflation would erode whatever cash they had on-hand.
 
People just wanted to park their cash on whatever they could lay their hands on, shoe-box units, bonds, preference shares, the list goes on and on.
 
Fast-forward to 2014 and all of us can see that the buying has hit a plateau. Liquidity, while still strong internationally, is beginning to ebb due to a confluence of factors: fear has been rising in emerging markets and in Asia. 
 
There has been a gradual transfer of fear in the system, from the U.S. and Europe to the once red-hot emerging and Asian markets.
 
Shock absorbers are being put in place in the western world through improving jobless numbers and other economic indicators; at the same time, more and more bad news about our side of the world is being worked through mass-media, effectively flattening any safety buffer that we may have in an inevitable fall.
 
You and I know how the game is played. The financial world is no more than a massive game of musical chairs. It is not about if the music stops, but when it ceases. 
 
Unfortunately, the ones who suffer the most are those who are swayed by the news that they take at face-value. They are the retail investors, whose role in this larger-than-life game is simply to provide the meat for the vultures to eat.

Part 2
 
When asset prices have reached levels that are financially viable for the vultures to act, the next step is to trigger the fall.
 
These birds-of-prey benefit from both recovering markets and crashing ones because they have access to elaborate financial mechanisms that let them earn by going long and taking short positions.
 
The size and depth of the trigger-event depend heavily on the euphoria present in the markets. Firstly, the shock absorbers must have been eliminated. This is achieved by messages sent out to smart money who are on the look-out for such signs. 
 
Smart money begins to pull out of investments in Asia and emerging markets while allowing retail investors to take over their role so that they are still able to sell at sky-high prices.
 
The not-so-smart (but still smart compared to retail investors) money who do not have access to the same protocol realise slightly late that smart money has been exiting the system and now begin their own less-graceful exodus from the markets.
 
As they are more numerous, the effect of their selling is more visible and begins to inject fear into the markets.
 
Once smart money has exited the system, the news engine is started and negative news about the markets to be shorted are fed into mainstream media in bursts.
 
With each burst, more of the safety buffer that naturally occurred during the price-recovery period is eroded.
 
When sufficient safety buffer has been taken out (by monitoring the response of the relevant markets), the dark swan event is ready to be activated.
 
There are a few characteristics of the ideal dark swan event:
 
a. it is preceded by a pseudo dark swan event; in the Lehman crisis, that role will filled by Bear Stearns. This pseudo dark swan event is critical because it takes the air out of the last bit of shock absorber that may still be in the market(s) to be shorted
 
b. it must cause immense fear and panic, and trigger the first powerful wave of selling
 
c. it has to have a strong enough storyline for the next waves of selling to form. One of the best ways would be a storyline on systemic issues such as flawed market-wide practices that are deeply embedded in the current ways certain financial mechanisms work in the target market(s)
 
d. there must be an alternative market(s) for funds to flow to. There is little point in triggering a fire to chase the crowd of out a room if the doors are all locked-down (unless of course the intention is to kill everyone in the room)
 
e. the dark swan event must be followed by supporting events and activities that expand on the storyline from point c
 
Everyone is expecting interest rates to rise. Thus the interest rate hikes that are anticipated is not best candidate for the dark swan event. However it can play a major supporting role because it effectively wipes out the leverage that has been instrumental in the rise of asset prices in EM and Asia.
 
 
Sounds impressive and cheem. Good enough for a cursory overview. But probing deeper where the devil are in the details, I have questions for you but let's just start with one.What do you mean by "once the tools of leverage have been disabled"? Be specific. On what tools of leverage you are referring to, how they will be executed and how they will be disabled.

Part 2
 
When asset prices have reached levels that are financially viable for the vultures to act, the next step is to trigger the fall.
 
These birds-of-prey benefit from both recovering markets and crashing ones because they have access to elaborate financial mechanisms that let them earn by going long and taking short positions.
 
The size and depth of the trigger-event depend heavily on the euphoria present in the markets. Firstly, the shock absorbers must have been eliminated. This is achieved by messages sent out to smart money who are on the look-out for such signs. 
 
Smart money begins to pull out of investments in Asia and emerging markets while allowing retail investors to take over their role so that they are still able to sell at sky-high prices.
 
The not-so-smart (but still smart compared to retail investors) money who do not have access to the same protocol realise slightly late that smart money has been exiting the system and now begin their own less-graceful exodus from the markets.
 
As they are more numerous, the effect of their selling is more visible and begins to inject fear into the markets.
 
Once smart money has exited the system, the news engine is started and negative news about the markets to be shorted are fed into mainstream media in bursts.
 
With each burst, more of the safety buffer that naturally occurred during the price-recovery period is eroded.
 
When sufficient safety buffer has been taken out (by monitoring the response of the relevant markets), the dark swan event is ready to be activated.

a. it is preceded by a pseudo dark swan event; in the Lehman crisis, that role will filled by Bear Stearns. This pseudo dark swan event is critical because it takes the air out of the last bit of shock absorber that may still be in the market(s) to be shorted

It is not possible to give a single answer to that because the optimal method depends on several factors:
 
a. risk appetite of the individual
 
b. total assets that the individual has
 
c. total amount of liquid and illiquid assets he owns
 
d. how fast he wishes to grow his portfolio
 
At the present moment I am adopting a cash-heavy position. Mileage will vary because the extent of being cash-heavy depends on the above factors.
 
I am not a financial consultant but I have done research for my own needs. For myself, these are the guidelines I use:
 
a. take care of the downside and the upside takes care of itself
 
b. patience is the greatest virtue of an investor
 
c. know the difference between a good buy and a falling knife
 
d. liquidity is the key to capital preservation
 
e. banks rarely lend to you when you desperately need the cash

I am also on the liquid side (strategy (d)) but it has been quite a wait so far ((b) is being tested)....  Adopting strategy (a) and © too as not chasing and buying only value stocks with strong cash flows, low gearing and those not so prone to economic cycle.  Basically a very conservative portfolio.
 
Just wondering if I should offload my in-the-money US equities but Asia appears to be more risky as bubbles are everywhere.

Where US equities are concerned, they have been very careful to conserve the uptrend while periodically flushing out the weak hands with well-timed releases of bad news in mainstream media. 
 
My read of the strategy that they have at the moment is to decouple the US equity markets from the EM and Asian markets. This takes time but the decoupling is taking place by the mechanism that I cited earlier: fear transfer.
 
Greed is growing fast in US equities to displace the fear that was there not too long ago while the reverse is happening over at our side.
 
Thus if your US holdings are in-the-money by a good amount, it should not hurt to hold them because the regular corrections to force capitulation (a necessary ingredient in keeping the uptrend intact) would not adversely affect your holdings by a lot.
 
For asian markets, the wait will be for quite a while more as it would not be prudent to buy in in the first 50% or so of the bear market. A few factors that I personally use as a guide to start of staggered entry:
 
a. breadth and depth of fall in prices should be no less than 25% of highs
 
b. duration of bear trend (from first dark swan event) should have been no less than 1 year
 
c. at least 1 major key event that can make for a convincing recovery story must have taken place
 
d. overwhelmingly more sellers than buyers in the market (minimally five sellers to every one buyer)

You should watch for currency fluctuation risk as well because the US dollar is projected to drop further against SGD (unconfirmed rumor though).

I didn't know Jeff Tay has ventured into Iskandar - assuming Pacific Star Development Pvt Ltd is the Pacific Star he created

 
rumours have it that this is first of the several that he will launch in SEA... but just rumours only 
 
Location is quite nice. I visited the site while staying at Traders. Good view and with upcoming ferry service to harbourfront, u can potentially skip the traffic, especially if you have your own boat.

They actually play several cards in their hand:
 
a. the petrodollars scheme to keep demand for the USD strong and therefore preserve its status as one of the world's reserve currencies
 
b. their military and technological superiority provides a massive backdrop for all political and economic manoeuvring
 
c. their status as the biggest debtor in the world ensures that their bondholders (China, Japan, etc) step in line to avoid their assets falling to naught overnight
 
China's road to becoming a superpower is not going to be a smooth path. 
 
At the rate that they were growing, they were going to burn out sooner than later. Investors used to that kind of growth rate would have the same expectations moving forward.
 
It is thus necessary that they work on conditioning investors with a lower growth rate in order to be sustainable for the long-term.
 
This means that they have to bring the growth rate down in non-threatening manner and supplanting that decrease with alternative reasons for them to remain relevant to investors.
 
As their own populace becomes more affluent and educated, they need to move up the value-chain. They cannot remain the factory of the world forever.
 
The tricky part is how they will wean themselves off that global role. One potentially viable way is to leverage on their success stories such as Alibaba and Weibo, sending them into the western world to establish footholds.
 
The recent rout in the RMB was to create sufficient pain so that currency investors / speculators would not think that there is only one direction for the currency to go (up).
 
The US has been screaming that the RMB has been undervalued all these while and they will continue to do that.
 
The PBOC has been fighting tremendous buying pressure which can result in the RMB shooting sky-high within days, if not hours. Such a situation would be disastrous for China.
 
By adding uncertainties and risk to the equation, the PBOC is ironically leveraging on fear in the markets to help them fight this battle. 
 
On the other hand, the chinese government knows that moving forward it needs the RMB to become one of the global reserve currencies in order to reduce the tremendous global leverage that the US has through its own USD.
 
The RMB needs to become fully-convertible in order for that to happen.
 
It is a fine balancing act with an ever-shifting sweet spot with gold as a back-up plan.

Japan and South Korea are the natural foils to China's dominance in this region and eventually worldwide.
 
The key reason for US support for Japan's emerging from its lost decade is the role that it will play in tempering China's strength in several dimensions: military, economic and political.
 
We can see from Japan's recent stance that they are able to play it hard and soft (isle disputes, economic recovery, military expansion).
 
This is one of the hardest methods to guard against; how do you interact someone who is at times friendly and at other times harsh and hostile?
 
This means Japan's role is to distract China at various levels - sap the latter's energy and resources while the main onslaught comes from another angle.
 
Putin cannot lose Ukraine to the western powers. That is why he had to act the way he did. If he had let Ukraine slip to the west, Russia would have ended in a significantly disadvantageous position politically, militarily and economically.
 
The west did not expect him to take such a strong stand and so quickly. That is the reason for their relatively weak response. Had the incursion into Crimea been another country other than Russia, the US military would have had it for breakfast.
 
Sanctions are not going to cut it. Both the west and Putin knows that and the latter is using this to his big advantage - he will want more of Ukraine. Ideally, it would be to break Ukraine into two halves and he has the eastern side to himself. That would suffice for his needs.
 
The west understands this too and would allow this if Putin presses hard enough.
 
They cannot allow a war to take place because that would jeopardise the recovery plan they have back at home for the US and European economies/markets. 
 
China and Russia inevitably will work together. The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
 
However the chinese play the game one level better. They will never allow their courtship with the Russians to become public unless the relationship is strong enough to face the light of day.

in china
1. properties over development ... just look at the ghost towns and blocks and blocks of new flats unoccuppied
2. properties price is totally out of reach for the 90% of ordinary chinese. only the rich buy.
 
in spore
1. every block build ... got people ... there is no ghost town ... even not 100% occupied ... sooner or later govt will bring in people
2. the price is not out of reach ... in fact anything below $1M+- is CHEAP for majority / mass market
 
last but not least ... govt can open tap and close tap anytime including prata flipping policy

Well, I admit. The current price is out of reach to me. $1.5M for a 3 bedder, $1.3M for a pathetic 70sqm 2 bedder, no way for me. When I drive pass a new condo launch site, I will think, oh another few hundred is going to join the million dollar club. I wish them well.
