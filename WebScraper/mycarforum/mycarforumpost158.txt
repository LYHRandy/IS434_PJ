$30m price tag likely for 3-storey super penthouse
Melissa Tan The Straits Times Thursday, Nov 28, 2013
 
 
A mega "super penthouse" to be built on Guocoland's Clermont Residence in Tanjong Pagar could be the largest of its kind in Singapore - and that's not just a reference to the estimated $30 million price tag.
 
"Super penthouse" at Tanjong Pagar to cost $30m
 
 
 

The three-storey home will be a staggering 21,108 sq ft - a five-room Housing Board flat is only about 1,200 sq ft - and will come with a dedicated private lift, a pool and a glass-floored cantilevered balcony.
 
Its indicative price is said to be $30million, which would also catapult it into the ranks of the most expensive penthouses here.
 
Consultants said it would likely appeal to rich investors. Chesterton Singapore managing director Donald Han said it would likely appeal to foreigners, who are not allowed to buy good-class bungalows (GCBs) in Singapore.
 
"It could be someone who would buy it and use it for entertainment... to show they've already arrived."
 
Century 21 chief executive Ku Swee Yong noted that it was even bigger than some GCBs which, he said, typically have a built-up area of up to around 10,000 sq ft. "It would be like living in a GCB up in the sky," he said.
 
The "super penthouse" occupies the top three floors of the 64-storey Clermont Residence and is estimated to be more than 250m above ground.
 
However, market watchers speculate that the unit could eventually be sold to Guocoland insiders. The company is controlled by Malaysian billionaire Quek Leng Chan.
 
"I'm sure it was built for a purpose. It could even be reserved for him (Mr Quek)," Mr Han said.

i have seen houses in indonesia have many maid, 4-5 in a household and the owners are fine if they just sit around chit chat, it is common there as hiring a maid to do manual washing is cheaper than a washing machine (just saying), but to do it in singapore, 5 maids would cost $4K a month !!

The median price of 99-year Sentosa Cove condo units has dropped 44.2 per cent over two consecutive quarters, from $2,950 per square foot (psf) in Q1 2013 to $1,646 psf in Q3 - a pricing level that is about 1.5 per cent lower than their 99-year-leasehold counterparts in Districts 9, 10 and 11 as well as the financial district on the mainland."Considering that prices of condominiums in Sentosa Cove once climbed as high as 133.1 per cent above their mainland counterparts in Q1 2008, this about-turn today represents a possible window of opportunity for value investment and to snare a dream home," said Colliers.
Also, the $1,646 psf median price in Q3 is just 25.6 per cent more than the $1,311 psf median price of 99-year mass-market condos in Outside Central Region in the same period.

To the Chinese and many other foreigners, 99 years is a long time cos the lease tenure in their homeland and elsewhere is much shorter.
 
And they kept saying that paying a few million for a 99 years home is SO CHEAP!!

I also believe the developer built it for himself. Old-time developers do that a lot.
 
The man who developed People's Park Complex had the whole top floor to himself. He even installed a swimming pool in it. Only when he got into financial difficulty was his unit split up into multiple ones and sold to the public.

it's probably not so much about the 30m, but the bragging rights.
 
clermont residence is going to be the tallest building in singapore at 290m, when it is completed. there is only one such unit. even if others have 30m, they can't buy it.

i'm sure you can get a better penthouse with a better view, and above 300m too.
 
but i'm not so sure about the less than 30m part.  
 
this is Highcliff, near Happy Valley, where Michelle Reis lives. the last transacted price was for a unit on the 66th floor was HK$368,800,000 (around S$62 million)
