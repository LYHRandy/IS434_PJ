An average of 46,300 people are granted Singaporean permanent resident (PR) status every year for the past eight years, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Mr Wong Kan Seng said in Parliament today.

Let's help save some face for these 2 ministars. Assuming equal number of males and females and PR marries PR in best case, 23150 flats are still needed to house these economic refugees, at least a nicer figure than 46300.

Why must PR strcictly buy new BTO???
 

you mean:
 

PR cannot buy private property??

PR cannot buy resale HDB??

PR cannot rent property ??

PR cannot rent a room ??

PR cannot marry local and stay with local family ??

PR cannot already have been staying here for donkey years and only just got PR status, and therefore are not looking to buy new flat ?
 

so many possibilities and you only chose to think PR must buy new flat from HDB, sigh, think a bit before you bash.

it would be good if PR is only given to those who earn >8-10K /mth.

Force them to buy private properties.
 

HDB is for Singapore citizens la, who are being squeezed out of the market by our 

government.
 

Sad case would be, if no one stops the government, we will no longer have any roots.

There would be no true blue singaporeans, we will end up like a china city/state in the near future....

sadly, most of the FT are keen in HDB, and earning the same pay as average local. today interview for staff. 6.5 out of 10 are from india or malaysia or china. asking pay is 1800 to 2200. 
 

to them HDB is either on par or better then what they have back home. most of them still need to send money back home 
 

only concern is want PR status.

So the number doesn't inlcude children? And since when are PR economic refugees? Please don't use inflammatory terms, its not conducive to debate

You should be the one tinking before you respond. Where in my post did I say PRs buy the new HDB flats? Perhaps you do not understand what was my point. 
 

MY POINT IS RECORD NUMBER OF PRs CAUSED PRICES TO RISE. NEW AND OLD HDB FLATS ALIKE!  
 

When PRs buy resale the prices of resale flats go up. When resale prices go up, prices of new flats will also go up.  So I am telling you that PRs come to Singapore and affect the prices of new HDB flats directly or indirectly esp when the supply of new flats has been cut drastically in the last 5 years.

Ok...assuming that the new PR in the next few year are reduced(as promised by the prince), that will still be maybe around 30,000(guesstimate) new PR per year.

Is building 10,000 HDB per year enough for Singaporeans and PR to buy?

I mean even if these 30,000 PR do not buy HDB...they still need to rent right?

Assuming 3 PR squeeze into one HDB unit, then 10,000 HDB per year is just enough for 10,000 singaporeans to buy and rent it out to the PRs.
 

Where with the other 40,000(estimated) plus singaporeans born each year stays? Stay in Condo and Bangalows hur??
 

Something is not right man.
 

This can only means that HDB will be in HOT demand, and it will shoot up to $1million within 5 years!

So Marborol is hinting to us that the HDB will appreciates, no wonder the other day the reason for the property tax increased was explained that its required now to avoid future bigger increase.
 

So BUY BUY BUy properties today....100% nap shot make money!!

haha nice try at a come back after you realised your opening posts made no sense at all
 

your opening post only mentioned 10k new flats a year but another minister say 46k new PRs a year. where got mention anything about price????
 

anyway your new argument does not hold water neither...
 
 
 

if you think of the simplistic view, increase in population will increase in demand for housing and therefore prices will increase, you r correct
 

but this is the real world and it isnt ceteris paribus, so there are many other factors affecting demand and prices
 
 

1.) PR increase by 46k does not mean demand for PUBLIC housing will go up by the same proportion, getting a PR means a change in nationality status, not necessary an increase in population, although the latter is likely to be true, but there will be cases where a person have been staying in singapore for many many years and have just finally gotten PR status 
 

2.) as mentioned, PR can also buy private property, rent a room, already have existing property, staying with local citizen, not staying in singapore, etc etc., so 46k increase in PR need not equate to a like for like increase in demand for public housing
 

3.) also there could also been a decline in citizen's demand for public housing and therefore a 46k increase in PR does not equate to a like for like increase in demand for housing.
 

4.) housing prices only broke the 1996 record prices this year in june i think. Prior to that, public housing price index was always below the 1996 peak. in other words, the hdb prices over the last 12 years prior to june 2008 was way below the levels as that in 1996!!!! and we know that 1996 hdb flat prices boom not due to influx of PRs then, so what was it due to??? what caused the prices to rise in 1996 will answer you question and show your lack of understanding of the public housing price index and what affects hdb prices
 

We are now merely catching up prices there were a decade old. see http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10201p.nsf/WP...ex?OpenDocument
 

5.) also with prices, u will think demand and of course supply. do you know how much flats were taken out of market, how much was supplied over the last 8 years, and how much of the population upgraded from public to public housing during these time??? without knowledge of such info, your statement of 46k increase in PR and only 10k increase in BTO flats will cause price to rise is simply a sweeping statement. sounds logical but not necessarily the truth
 
 

anyway a gradual increase in public housing prices at a steady pace is a good thing, can you imagine what will happen if all our property prices remain stagnant throughout the years??? so i dont understand what you want to complain about....

Wow you write such a long post. If you think the prices of HDB flats not related to high inflow of PRs then I dun wan to argue anymore.

no argument no knowledge.... uu just dismiss his statements like that?
 

Think about it. There must be a basis of fact.
 

In the PR population, there is a spectrum of age groups, ranging from poor to rich. Those rich professionals here of coz stay in private housing. But those poorer ones leh? Those which can buy flats, bought one. Those who cant afford to buy one / need a flat urgently, rent. Hence, it is undeniable that a proportion of our HDB flats have indirectly gone to the foreigners through rental.
 

Now the question is, how high? Conservatively, I bet its around 70%. Bus drivers, cleaners, customer service assistants, etc. etc. all need proper lodgings. And money-minded Singaporeans of coz look for these people for income lor. Stay at parents' place but buy another flat, tell garmen want to move out from parents' place end up didn't.
 

The 10000 flats really not enough.
 

Ad HDB is really inefficient. Why spend so much to design a precinct when the end result is just an elaborated, exaggerated mess? I mean... it look so nice from afar but once you get up close you

Actually this is not the only factor for the price rise la.

Influx of PRs is the main reason for the rise. The other factor of course is the drastic reduction of supply.
 

Back in 2001 the premium 4 room flats in Punggol was going for S$170,000/-. It came with the flooring done and had fancy gardens etc etc. Now these are being offered between S$250,000 to S$290,000 by HDB.

at least you have an argument here. 
 

anyway since when i said HDB is efficient?? if they are efficient and had foresight thene wont have to wait till next year to increase supply le
 

btw PR only occupy 5% of flats here, so their impact on demand is small

1980s 5 room at mature estate can get for less than 80k, now can sell easily at 400k no sweat
 

only 30 years and increase 5 folds.
 
 
 

anyway no one will see their property through to the end of the 99 years, most likely 50 years will tear down already, by then with inflation alone will cause it to appreciate by more than what you have paid several times over

anyway whichever costing methodoly does not dispell the facts that you dont need 99 years for a property to appreciate.
 

so what they changed their price strategy? does it mean property prices wont do up?

haha. Just to clarify: I used the word "foreigners", not "PR"
 

To me I find both no diff. Both compete with Singaporeans in the labour market after all. And both also will get access to HDB flats somehow.

you want to talk appreciation, better still, that will weaken the TS grounds even more. 
 

increase in PRs over last eight years was 46k average per year, and there are reports saying there was shortage of supply during the recent years, much less than 10k per year. so one would expect PRs to cause hdb prices to APPRECIATE a lot over the last decade right, ceteris paribus???
 

in fact the opposite is true, prices have not risen much since 1996. 
 

if you take away inflation and do an index analysis, u will realise that HDB resale prices only increased since 1996 only in mid 2008. 
 

and you would know that the 1996 was not due to PRs, it was other factors.

Influx of PRs is the main reason for the rise. The other factor of course is the drastic reduction of supply.
 

Back in 2001 the premium 4 room flats in Punggol was going for S$170,000/-. It came with the flooring done and had fancy gardens etc etc. Now these are being offered between S$250,000 to S$290,000 by HDB.



 

Another of the price increase is because the launches are closer and closer to MRT. Thus higher and higer price.

Its alright la. Seriously.
 
Coz b4 I move into Sengkang I also didnt know that there are so many ppl in Sg who like to buy extra flats to rent out, hence causing the shortage we face today. Imagine if I didn't move in I may not even know about this situation today.


 
 
 
so many pple???? another sweeping statement
 
tell me who in SG can buy extra flats??? who can buy more than 1 flat???? or buy a flat when he already owns a private property???
 
 
 
only people are those who already got hdb and subsequent got private, and these folks will only have at most 1 hdb flat .....  how to buy extra flats and rent out?

i dont know him personally, but i know the statements he made, which made me form my opinion that he talks without basis
 

see this from wikipedia:
 


In the 2001 elections, the SDP failed to win any seat but captured national attention when during the campaign, Chee Soon Juan refused to greet Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong at a hawker centre, and along with his followers, lifted up their fists and chanted slogans. Later, from his campaign vehicle, Chee posed the following question to Goh Chok Tong: "Where is the S$18 billion that you have lent to Suharto?". The PAP took Chee Soon Juan to task, demanding he should apologise or else he would face defamation lawsuits. Under pressure from the governing party, Dr Chee and his party apparently apologised a day later.
 
 

btw there are opposition leaders whom have substance and can challenge the thunderbolt with valid grounds, folks like chiam and low are pple i respect...
 

not chee soon juan, who is a nuisance and his views and words are never taken as worthy by me

u have no argument at all, and no knowledge of what you are talking about, only make sweeping statements, and shoot minister but cannot substantiate why you say that except by making simplistic sweeping statements with no foundation. 
 

so who is one who is stupid, it is damn clear who has a stand and point of view, and who is sprouting nonsense
 

i dont support thunderbolt in all they do, but your thread n remarks are really no substance. if you want thunderbolt to have a good fight, you need knowledge and not another chee soon juan type, just whack without proper basis.

Ok before the whole thread gets out of hand, let me give my opinion. I actually have no intention of posting coz I was waiting for my farmville crops to harvest and read a bit of posts here then I saw this. 
 

Since its late and I am abit tired, I just want to bring up a few points. To be fair, TangoElite does bring a few valid points, as well some other members here. But I just like to highlight a few things for now.
 


4.) housing prices only broke the 1996 record prices this year in june i think. Prior to that, public housing price index was always below the 1996 peak. in other words, the hdb prices over the last 12 years prior to june 2008 was way below the levels as that in 1996!!!! and we know that 1996 hdb flat prices boom not due to influx of PRs then, so what was it due to??? what caused the prices to rise in 1996 will answer you question and show your lack of understanding of the public housing price index and what affects hdb prices 

We are now merely catching up prices there were a decade old. see http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10201p.nsf/WP...ex?OpenDocument

 

I agree with this point. It is true that 1996 is the peak of HDB prices. After that government step in to cool down the property market and it never recover until recently. Of course there are other reasons like financial crisis in 97/98 etc. In 1999 to 2000 saw prices pick up abit but this is more due to sentiments than actual demand/supply reasons. But throughout the period until 2005, prices for HDB flats remain sluggish. There were plenty of left overs for 5 rooms to Exec. Nobody wants to buy them during those period. Anyway to say PRs have no effect on the pricing during 90s that time is not exactly true also. It seems like everyone forgot about Hong Kong PRs and those who become citizens in the 90s. They did contribute to the crazy buying & selling of HDB and private properties that time and Bishan is one of their hot favourite location. If anyone have the chance go check out the prices of Bishan flats. With so many good schools there and government heavily promoting there(as well as Pasir Ris), prices of HDB flats at Bishan was record high. Both Hongkongers and Singaporeans rushing to buy Bishan flats. And of course there are other reasons like speculating and agents/sellers taking advantage of loophole from HDB to buy and sell like nobody's business. 
 

Another point is even though yes, the news article mentioned only 5% of PRs bought HDB, but their ability to pay COV do help push up the resale prices, other than those enbloc-ers who got cash to spare. This is speaking from my own knowledge. I am actually not allow to mention this so early but just for info, an Indian PR pay 6xk COV for a EM in Hougang. And I dont have to say recently the record breaking 4 room flat in Forfar Heights the Indonesian PR and his Singaporean wife also pay over 6xk COV. So we can see some of these PRs do have cash to spare. 
 


anyway a gradual increase in public housing prices at a steady pace is a good thing, can you imagine what will happen if all our property prices remain stagnant throughout the years??? so i dont understand what you want to complain about....
 

Yes, that is what the government is trying to do. Valuation has increase in all locations in Singapore is because the government says so. The government wants it that way. And for those who can see, this year the government actually relies on property market to boast our economy and GDP. 
 

The fact is, in Singapore it is difficult to say prices are affected by demand and supply. Singapore market is too small to do that. Prices of property, whether is HDB or private, is only affected mainly by one thing, the policy of the PAP government. They control the supply side. They decide whether more land should be on sale or not, and at what prices. So very logical, if the developer bid higher price, it will sell at even higher price to get profit. If developer bid low low, government can choose not to approve tender. Etc etc the rest no need to explain. 
 

Another thing I think Tango is abit harsh on Alfisti168. Sengkang indeed have build and design flats, it was the previous name for the now current premium flat. Those blk 31x in Anchorvale, blk 68x in Jurong West are some of the examples. Now all of them are simply known as Premium flats.

yup I agree with most of the points Tangoelite makes. I think we should at least try to make LOGICAL arguements than unsubstantiated sweeping statements. And when other people point out our error, we should be be reasonable enough to admit our own mistake. Else how to have a logical discussion?
 
 

The way HDB is structured is CITIZENS can buy new, PRs can only buy resale. That in a way is already an big plus for citizens. Just ask any HDB owners who bought their flats at least 5 years ago.

finally a post that can make for good reading...
 

anyway i agree that PRs do make prices go up, but i say the impact is not that great as what TS is trying to claim. prices are mostly being affected by the buying power and selling power of CITIZENS. here and there, there will be cases of PRs would are very rich, but there are also local citiizens who are rich too and have caused COV to go up. since about 80%-90% of those who bought resale are locals, that means local ability to pay high COV should be the driving force of COV, PR play a small part.
 

point noted on sengkang flats, if i am wrong about the names of those flats, i'll admit it. Cos to my knowledge those are either bto or premium, and design build and sell scheme flats was only recent thing.

some people have an natural tendency to bash the govt on anything they can find
 

for the record, i dont support thunderbolt entirely or 1 dominant party thing. they have their faults and it is up to us to find those real faults and challenge them, not pick on any issue we dream off, it only serve to make them look better.
 

For singapore to have another party to stand up to thunderbolt, they must be knowledgeable and able to bring up valid points to challenge the thunderbolt. this is the only way opposition will get voted in at significant levels and help our nation progress faster.

based on the previous post and TE post, you assume only citizens buying is of the only market of consequence. Government is price setter and cetizen is price taker. maximizing the price to prop up GDP by government.

citizens highly leveraged on debt.
 

you keep saying citizens can afford it, but once the liquidity is withdrawn, you will see more defaults. you think the market keeps going up? once there is a downward shift in valuation, the banks will come after you because your loan is in negative equity.
 

is putting citizens in a high debt position a good thing the government is doing? you can say if you can't afford it don't buy. there are many factors at play, and your points are all that the government only wants you to look at. you failed to talk about:

1. hdb was set up to provide affordable housing for the majority of citizens.

2. speculation by developer (for example: en bloc sale subtracts the total number of dwelling units in the country, these people flushed with cash will go out to buy, but new units of the en bloc will end up costing more and is smaller)

3. CPF liberalised to use to buy hdb (this was the main cause of the spike)

4. GCT's policy to raise property prices

5. expansion of credit (to make citizens feel rich and rooted here)

6. hdb's building program of 30k units per year in 2000 to some 5k to 10k per year in 2002.

7. government's hand at raising rental yields for the new downtown and even JTC fatories. Commercial and Residential land prices rise in tandem.

8. speculation by citizens and real estate agents (limited measures implemented here)
 

its not so simple my fren.

thanks for bringing out these points 1 to 8, its making my case stronger that prices dont depend soley on PR increase. TS pls read his post as well. more valid points
 
 

btw since when i assume citizens buying is of the ONLY market consequence???? i said citizens buying plays a bigger part, PR smaller part!!! dont misquote me.
 
 

and have you ever heard of bank going against HDB owners cos their units is in negative position, loan more than value??? for private condo i have heard of, but for hdb, i sua ku never heard of, is there such a case in the first place? i have a feeling that u saying banks claiming against hdb owners is a myth, i own up now that i dont really know, but i really feel u r wrong here. cos HDB resale are sold with COV, COV cannot be loaned, only valued amount can be loaned, and also can only loan 80% of valued amount, so unlikely hdb valuation will drop so much for banks to claim back as what u have claimed. i have yet to come across such case for HDB, if i am wrong i will admit, so please show me.
 
 

for private yes, very easy to happen, cos people can loaned with the so called "COV" inside, hence once valuation drop, very likely that loan amount is over market value.

The design build and sell scheme should not be confused with what I said earlier. HDB has standardised all the name to just simply premium flat in order not to be confused with DBSS which they introduced a couple of years back.

That is why I said it is the policy of the government that really influence the pricing and therefore, demand and supply. 
 

I can say government made a very big mistake in allowing prices of properties, especially HDB flats to go uncheck in the 90s. Now there is no turning back and they have no choice but to maintain or increase the prices if not alot of owners are going to cry thanks to the ridiculous price they paid previously. I can forsee we will have this situation again for the buyers who bought this year.

correct, which i why i said it is good and necessary for govt to maintain steady increase in prices, no boom, no crash, slow steady increase by govt policies and supply control
 

and not the case where prices increase only just because due to 46k PRs coming

nope this I beg to differ. I will vote a monkey in actually as long as it belongs to the opposition.



 

Previously I will look at the candidate's profile 1st before I decide but not anymore. Just put a big X in the alternative party's box can already. There are way too many petty behaviour by the PAP government that is hindering our progress and maturity as a country. 
 

Think about it, if people like Durai can dare to display his arrogance openly, suing anyone who accuses him, why did he dare to do it? Is it because someone or some organisation more powerful than him/NKF is doing it also? And getting away with it? No doubt his downfall is due to his case against SPH, but that is because he thought he is immune from accusation and invincible, but he forgot that SPH is own by PAP government

correct, which i why i said it is good and necessary for govt to maintain steady increase in prices, no boom, no crash, slow steady increase by govt policies and supply control
 

and not the case where prices increase only just because due to 46k PRs coming



 

The problem is it will not work. Simply because our economy is very open. We are easily affected by external factors. That is why for every 3 to 5 year boom, we will have 2 to 3 year recession. And the salary of the people cannot catch up with the price increase because we are always in the vicious cycle of boom and recession. 
 

The PAP government wants the people to work and work, to do that they practice inflationary measures so that people will continue to work for that price increase.

yes, the increase is not due to the 46K PRs coming but at the same time, the govt is not doing it part

to maintain steady prices or slow steady increase looking at the last few years the price shoot up.
 

Instead, I see them profiteering in a even smarter way, selling the idea of private sector buidling DBSS flat e.g Natura Loft ,etc.

Effectively they shift the risk to the private contractor but profit by just selling land at high price.
 

Outcome, these DBSS are pricier and whether these flat can sell or not is not govt. business. 

Hopefully, I don't see the day when all the HDB flat is tender out to private sector and govt role

is just reduce to sell land. That will be the day theHDB price really shoot thru the roof.

yup I agree with most of the points Tangoelite makes. I think we should at least try to make LOGICAL arguements than unsubstantiated sweeping statements. And when other people point out our error, we should be be reasonable enough to admit our own mistake. Else how to have a logical discussion?
 
 

The way HDB is structured is CITIZENS can buy new, PRs can only buy resale. That in a way is already an big plus for citizens. Just ask any HDB owners who bought their flats at least 5 years ago.



 

so what if citizens can buy brand new ?

if u have look at the latest balloting offering on HDB website, can see it is easily more than 10x oversubsribed for the miserable number of units offered.

so what happens to the other 90+% who keeps trying to get a flat direct from HBD but no lucky enough?

So the number doesn't inlcude children? And since when are PR economic refugees? Please don't use inflammatory terms, its not conducive to debate



 

If WKS doesn't release the number, how would we to know how many children are given PR?
 

And the term economic refugees, go ask any of these PR where they would go next if say the Ringgit or Yuan is valued higher while their pay here remains the same, you can ask how many of these would return back to find it no longer worthwhile to stay here.

Next, go ask those PRC you know, are there sufficient jobs in their motherland for them? A few unrelated people told me, to get a job back there, you need to give ang pao (at least RMB 30k) to some higher ranking people with the connections. They will help you get a job, but whether to your liking or not is your problem.

And if it's not of economic reasons, why are they comming in the masses? Why ain't they going to say Indo or some other ulu places? Hence, my calling of them economic refugees are not wrong.

so u will vote monkey in as well. 
 

and ur point is because thunderbolt is hindering our progress and maturity of our country, so do u think a "monkey"/( or absolutely non qualified person) can do a better job and help our country progress faster and better? 
 

or is it a petty decision by you just to spite thunderbolt and u will feel happy to see thunderbolt trashed by a monkey?

yup it will not work, i never say it will work, i said it will be good for it to work, and necessary for govt to work towards that. eventual outcomes cannot be controlled like u said, i am drawing the perfect scenario
 
 

so u want a govt that doesnt people to work? than please state how do you think a country can progress when people dont work

correct there, so another agreed that increase not due to 46k PR coming.
 

whether govt was doing its part to maintain prices, that i never make any stand, cos i really dont know. but i do know is that they should work towards a general slow steady increase. whether it was achieved, i think everybody can decide for themselves
 

also correct is that HDB is shifting the risk to private contractor. agreed totally.
 

on the sales performance, what i gathered is that the sales are doing quite well, given the pricing, maybe their locations are good, as most DBSS near mrt, except bishan n simei

agreed totally.
 

i think HDB has failed to meet demand from locals, they have been ineffective in estimating demand over the last few years, now want to increase supply by 12k a year is somewhat too late already.
 

not enough foresight from HDB

if that really is ur mentality, i will never ever take another of your post seriously ever again, everything u say is  
 
 

btw i'd like to know how many else will do that? anybody else like him? maybe i should start a new poll, interesting topic i foresee



 

just because you cannot see a good reason to vote a monkey in doesn't mean that there isn't a good reason.
 

I have given some thought as to how I hope my country will progress in the next 50 years.
 

My conclusion is based on

1) Singapore has zero natural resources and our competitive adv is based solely on our "workforce" and "stability". The stability is derived from the BILLIONS of foreign reserves that our government has amassed through the years.
 

2) a one party system without the necessary checks and balances will just lead the country to ruin. It is only a matter of time as you just have to look at history to see how it all ends.
 
 

Most of us will agree on the need for a credible opposition. Unfortunately most people are like u, just sit there and WAIT for the credible opposition to appear..... I, on the other hand, are thinking on how this credible opposition can appear in our political landscape. The most obvious question is to ask myself, am I willing to run as the opposition? I will probably be a pretty good candidate. Comes from humble background, study hard, top exams, good career, married with one kid. Sadly the answer is no. The risk is too high and the chances are too slim. It is that simple. If you want GOOD people to run for opposition, you have to convince those people that they have a good chance of winning.? such people have good careers, good life and they are not willing to throw it all away for a "lost" cause.
 

So what can I do if I am not willing to run as opposition? I will vote monkeys in. Simple as that. It is just a message to other people out there who have the passion and capability, "if that monkey can get 40% vote, I have a good chance of winning" 
 

Of course you weigh in the risks of freak result with a monkey government vs the risk of status quo. I thought long and hard and I find the risk of status quo higher. Other people may think otherwise.
 
 

PS: it is NEVER to piss the current government. I have benefited a LOT from the policies that they have started. My family of seven lived in a one room HDB when I was four. Now me, my brother and my sister are all doing very well. I give credit when credit is due. The current government has done much more good than bad.

Why must PR strcictly buy new BTO???
 

you mean:
 

PR cannot buy private property??

PR cannot buy resale HDB??

PR cannot rent property ??

PR cannot rent a room ??

PR cannot marry local and stay with local family ??

PR cannot already have been staying here for donkey years and only just got PR status, and therefore are not looking to buy new flat ?
 

so many possibilities and you only chose to think PR must buy new flat from HDB, sigh, think a bit before you bash.



 
 

ermm... if im not wrong, PR cannot even buy new flat and landed. PR only allow to buy private property (other than landed) and HDB frm re-sale market. can anyone confirm?

agree with you on your "ps"... we always complain here n there. Just imagine, a small island, without any natural resources, no strong backup from other country, no money, no technology, no weapon, small population.... its really amazing how the garment lead the people to what we are today...

great post there. interesting view and i must admit you have a valid point and ur ideology is pretty sound, 
 

and it is true, very rare will you have a good candidate who will give up their comfort zone to be opposition here in singapore
 

but personally i dont think this is the way to motivate other good candidates to go in by setting a monkey example. because getting the monkey in is 1 thing, whether the monkey can survive or be seen as a ridicule is another, so may not be a good motivation i feel.

Actually there are quite a number of malaysian PRs buying HDB flats in Singapore and they are not staying in it. They rented it out to collect rent, they got house in JB, everyday travel in with their motorbike to work here.

They are making $$ with their HDB flat!!

And for those young local couples who wanted to start family, are left with not much choice but to apply for the BTO flats that normally need 3 to 4 years time to build which is generally cheaper in price as compare to the resale flats plus no need cash up front.

so many pple???? another sweeping statement
 

tell me who in SG can buy extra flats??? who can buy more than 1 flat???? or buy a flat when he already owns a private property???
 
 
 

only people are those who already got hdb and subsequent got private, and these folks will only have at most 1 hdb flat .....  how to buy extra flats and rent out?




Some scenarios like this can happen:
 

1. Buy a new flat to rent out and sell out when the price is right, yet continue to stay with parents' old flat bcoz 1. dun want them to live alone and 2. if the flat is big enough then why not?

2. Aiya. I dunno how lah. But my neighbour is one example. Somehow he has 2 flats (didn't ask him how he geddit) after he bought my next-door-unit in 2001. He moved in only in 2008 (after selling previous flat at high price). During those 7 years rented to lots of people. And my neighbour upstairs also. If you have seen my filipino case in one of the previous pages you'll be aware about it.

I do agree with some of your points.
 

We can either wait for a good opposite candidate to come out and vote for him or we first give strong support to opposite in order to attract more good candidates.
 

I strongly believe in 2 party or multi-parties political system as this is good for Singapore in the long run.  Therefore, I will support any opposite candidate as long as he is honest, sincere and talk with sense.

This will only happens after the old man has up lorry.  Looking at the currently situation, he is making his son a incapable leader.  look at the olden days where there are kings.  Usually when the king die then the rightful heir will then take over the throne. why? simple, 1 mountain cannot hide 2 tigers.  dun tell me what father and son love, when comes to power,wealth, fame,women,above all men anything can happen.  history is a fine morrior so many princes have killed thier fathers to take the throne.  The current situation is that singaprean should listen to who, the father or son? blur leh,1 said rich & poor gap will tear SG apart and the latter said it is unavoidable.  
 

I think he should just retire and stay at home and enjoy family blessing after all how long has he have.  Right now he is making him and his son a laughing stock.  the son is just like a puppet for wayang. other country pm and heavyweight will fill him funny.  they will think cant u stand alone, will u fall? do u need a wheelchair?

there is a sensible post. of course any decent candidate with good background will easily get our votes. no any monkey like chee soon juan.
 

that is what i am driving at.... 
 

some people seem content to have any monkey at all to be the inspiration. it will work, but it will attract more monkeys, not strong candidate.
 

do you think any strong candidate wants to be like chee soon juan? or look to him as a role model? i doubt so. i think chiam or low makes a better example and role model for any good candidate wishing to be opposition.

i quote you: 
 




Previously I will look at the candidate's profile 1st before I decide but not anymore. Just put a big X in the alternative party's box can already. There are way too many petty behaviour by the PAP government that is hindering our progress and maturity as a country.



 

u said you will not look at candidate profile anymore, will just vote in any opposition party. isnt it the same as voting any monkey will do??? if i infer wrongly pls clear up. 
 

if not explain how a monkey can do a better job? 
 

and your claims that govt make singaporean work and u dont seem happy with that, pls explain further, if not i will infer again and u will accuse me of twisting ur words when

So the bottomline is, "how are YOU going to help singapore achieve the 2 STRONG parties?" 
 

I think all journeys start with a baby step. And the first step towards a strong two party system is just getting more opposition into the system. monkeys or not monkeys. you just keep saying you want this you want that but how to make it happen? 
 

Singaporeans are like that complain but no solution. People complain about the market subsidy policy of HDB but they have no solution. Just complain.
 

I always ask myself what can I do. The risk of running as the opposition is quite a big and if that guy is willing to stand up and be counted for our country, monkey or not monkey, I will vote him in. My term monkey means with or without caliber. But he cannot be a hyena lah.... of dubious character, etc. If you compare candidates based on ability  and caliber, there is no way the opposition will win in the next few elections.
 

As I said, if you want successful people to stand up and run, you have to ensure that they have a reasonable chance of success. err... common sense right? successful people don't do things that has no chance of success.....

ALL i am saying is i will vote wisely, so can get 2 strong party. thats all to my point. everybody here seems to want 2 party system if i infer correctly. isnt that ur want as well? u want that, so what u going to do. 
 

according to you, u will vote anyone even if no caliber.
 

for me i will vote if got caliber. simples. 
 

that is the only difference between u and me, how we vote.
 
 

so u say i want this i want that, u are also no different from me. how come i dont see you making any step to get a monkey to go n run so u can vote him? easier said than done.
 
 

i doubt that voting in a monkey will be an inspiration to good and strong candidates. it may be an inspiration to other monkeys, but unlikely to inspire strong ones. and as i have said before, voting in a monkey is lacking foresight, short term u think u have given inspiration to others, but long term, it will be beneficial for the ruling party to make a case for themselves when the monkey eventually fails to deliver. so why help them by voting hapzardly, i think we should help oursleves by voting wisely. 
 
 

anyway the ruling party also got monkey amongst themselves already, but they will not expose them publicly, they will protect their own monkey and subsequently give them lower positions. if anybody challenge monkey without basis, they will sue them. 
 

however, if opposition got monkey or weak candidate, the ruling party will do all they can to expose them and make them fail big time, proven already, so really no point and not the way forward to vote in monkeys. what we need is strong opposition now. having monkeys is going back to square one and not progress, and wont inspire others.

before we talk about having 2 parties or monkey ,etc. In the first place, does the opposition have enough monkey in the first place?? I serious doubt so. 
 

My take is yes the ruling parties can win all they want and for sure they will win but make sure the % winning votes is less that the previous election. This in thte way is to tell them, people are more educated nowadays and

have a mind of their own and no longer listen blindly and serve as a wake up call to them

another reason why no monkey in opposition now is because they will fail, or have already failed before they can get in. 
 

i believe general public not stupid or that desperate to have any monkey will do. i believe most still vote wisely. have decent enough candidate will be voted in. monkey no chance.

haha thread into second page and you have no argument still 
 

btw PR only bought 5% of HDB. their impact on demand and supply of HDB units are small 
 

see here: http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/S...ory_458368.html
 
 

yet again you have been proven that your arguement hold no water, just sweeping statements... empty vessels make the most noise
 
 

btw i dont work for govt at all, hahaha wrong again



 

For a PR to be able to buy a resale flat, the previous owner must vacate his previous premises.

But this deprives a local an opportunity less to get a resale flat. if we just remove these PR from the equation, a local would have 100% of getting the flat either via BTO or resale market. The price would not have shot up so high in such a short time -> Demand and supply.
 

If they only take up 5% of the flats, can you roughly estimate how many units are taken up? If these 5% or say 4% were allocated to locals, what would be the demand be like now?
 

We've reached a state where we citizens are losing out to foreigners.

NS is for us to protect our land, but why are we protecting these foreigners that compete with us right down to basic housing?

It's interesting when we are able to see a monkey in the opposition. ain't they kept in the zoo or in the nature reserves?

Let me know which opposition party will be introducing "Mr Orang Utan" as his running mate.

hiaz, i have already covered this in previous posts. HDB has failed in planning for new housing to meet the demand. supply has not been enough to meet demand due to lack of foresight, HDB failed. so thats why prices increase. 
 

and yes PR come in will increase demand, but as stated, effects not much, many other people here have already given more inputs that i have as to what will cause the price to rise. read back on the thread and u will know that actuallly PR is small part. govt policies and lack of foresight is a bigger part
 
 
 

looking at your last statement, can u suggest how govt can further protect us in terms of housing? what would be your ideal world in terms of singaporeans being protected in terms of basic housing against foreigners? for eg, would you say PR cannot even buy resale flats? i like to hear u suggestions instead

capital gain tax perhap when the person relinquish his PR. Meaning if he bought the

HDB at $300K and sold for $400K, then maybe there should be capital-gain tax

of 50% either at the point of selling it or when he relinquish his PR. 

If one-half of the spouse is PR, the other is citizen, then capital gain tax is half.
 

Certainly, PR will think twice before commiting and forking out the kind of COV which

is beyond most young couple means.

that is for those who buy with investment mindset, using property to make money... (actually should cover under income tax, but hard to establish a PR buying resale as his business, so will never be captured under income tax)  
 

if not those who buy mainly for residing long term will not be too worried about making less of a profit bcos of captial tax. if there is captial gain tax, that means there is profit already. just how much profit is the question. if basic accomodation needs still there, they will still buy. unless they wanna investment and worried about returns then will be more prudent.
 

but still true, it will increase the overall prudence when PR buying property.
 

correct me if i am wrong, but singapore got no capital tax at all, stamp duties yes, property tax, but these are different, so the concept of capital tax is sort of contrary to singapore tax legislation or tax law. i not tax man but i think this is the case.

yes I will

with the kind of policies that the gahment is dishing out ( u know what i mean), it doesnt take a top elite to do the job.

a monkey can also do it ,

but without paying disgusting giant peanuts

yes there will be scenarios, but not a lot, do you know the % of homes that are rented out?




"Not a lot" is quite subjective here......
 

And you will know garmen's % homes rented out figures if you take the figure as it is. Some rentals are simply not declared to the garmen. And if you want to find exactly how much %s are not declared, its almost impossible.
 

Btw by talking about % rentals, are we a bit OT here? Now the topic of this thread I also not sure liaow.........

If what I suggest and can be heard, I'll be sitting in the seats of the policy makers.

If PRs can be restricted to buying resale flats, given the current housing shortage for locals, the policy should be tweated such that PRs be restricted to buying private properties. They can always get our citizenship if they want to buy subsidised housing. Ain't these people enjoying the best of both worlds. When they give up their PR, they sell off the flat, make a hugh profit, withdraw all their CPF and get the f out of here to greener pasture.

And how about those PRs who buy the flat and rent it out? Looking at the oversubscription of each BTO, you can see how many locals are in need for housing.
 

And I am not one of those who got a flat  at the current high price. I managed to get a new flat before MBT comes in as minister for MND.

I wonder what makes people think that alternative voices or opposition can't take on the job?

In the first place, there's no level playing field. Turn the tables around, if the lightning is in the position of what the 2 current opposition parties are, who would you vote?

Former British PM John Major had up to `O' level education, he still managed to lead UK through the period of the cold war and gulf war.

Do we really need people to be highly educated to lead? The Opps are just not proven yet, no harm voting them in.

If they can't perform, they'll be out in the next election, just like if the slipper man would have got in.

I won't deny either. Times have changed. Our forefathers are willing to sacrifice. They are involved in nation building, took up citizenship and stayed on.

Ask any PRs around, majority are just looking for quick financial gain and a quick exit.

Which was what I meant by economic refugees. these people would just hop on to the next stop that offers them better opportunities while other more deserving people who are willing to stay on are not offered PR.

??? why u say they are not sincere? if you look at HDB history, they actually built a LOT of flats up to the early 2000. More than 10k a year. That is why they are so bloated now.
 

It is unbelievable how big HDB is now, and how much it cost us just to built the few thousand of hdb flats a year..... I am surprised nobody brought up this issue yet.

During the downturn period in 2002-2004, they cut down a lot on building new flats and forced people to buy those leftovers.

Good that leftover flats are sold out, but what happens later? Now even people willing to select leftover flats are left with little or no choices.

The racial quota is another hinderance, there's a flat, but can only be sold to the specific race which may not be interested in getting one.
 

Prices of these leftover flats are sold close to market rate compared to the initial sale price, yet HDB can still make a loss of 2 billion.

Those people that just hop on to the next stop that offer them better opportunities are not economic refugees. They are foreign talent. Is a win-win situation where they gain experience while staying here while we gain their expertise as well. Of cos, the filtering system may not be 100%  clean. Some not so talented pples may slip through.. but as long as everyone is growing. it is good enough.

Define what is fairness? You want to split into 1st class citizenship and 2nd class citizenship? By what criteria? By the tax you are paying? Or the income you are earning? Or the paper qualification? If you want to talk about contribution back.. the flat that my father bought in the 1970s at 20k is worth 300k++

. Are my parents earning from the growth of the country?
 
 

Look at msia. Try to be fair by lowering down the standard so that their bumiputra can have degree-certified. What happened?
