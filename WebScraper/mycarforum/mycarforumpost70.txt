I would just change.
 
If u never used your oven for too long, it tends to spoil. I'm not sure what's the reason. But i was told to use mine at least once a month if not weekly.

i think easier to just change.....need to take out your measuring tape to measure though before you go shopping.
 
But then again, if you have not used it for > 1 yr.... do you really need it?

What's wrong with the oven? Does it trip whole house power when turned on? If it does, then it is the moisture in the heating elements. Cheaper to replace them.
 
Pull out the oven and check the backside   see what brand and model number
 
If replace the whole oven, get something slightly smaller for better ventilation

Ants were trying to build their colony/nest around the small seams around my oven enclosure

yeah precisely.
Those countertop convection ovens can probably do 70-80% of what these built in convection ovens can do except for consistent temperature during baking and the volume difference.

no it does not trip the house;
only the top part heats ups (the elements are exposed)  
My apt is tenanted ; yes I might have to certainly do that by pulling out by FS to see the BS

Change it. Not worth repairing as ovens are quite cheap nowadays. 
I replaced mine after been away for 2 years. It kept tripping.

Huh really? I thought they cost at least about $400 minimum ; i know they always have offers when you buy 3 components together so they have economies of scale

Actually. don't have to bake or cook anything. Just power on and let it run for a while.

oh ? Ok let me try it ; so far can feel only the heat of the top exposed element below and sides don't have element wire running
Normally is the heat coming from how many sides usually?? Wall side is a fan of course

Most convection ovens have 2 heating elements.
1 bottom 1 above. Bottom is concealed.
It depends on the setting knob. U can switch on 1 or both elements on.

Some also have heater in the fan.
I'm away for 6 months at a time.
When I come back I usually start the oven fan only with no temp.
After 5 mins I increase the temp slowly so the over 'dries out' if that is what causes the tripping.
But make sure that the ring main the oven is attached to can take 15 amp plus load.

Some ovens have this cleaning phase. Which the oven goes into it's maximum temperature for more than 1 hour. Actually it's been shown to be a major reason for an oven becoming spoilt. So please don't use it lol
