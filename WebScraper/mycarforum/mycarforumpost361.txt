URA Draft Master Plan: More housing planned for CBD, Marina Bay area
 

 
SINGAPORE: More homes will be built in the central business district (CBD) and Marina Bay area, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) said on Wednesday (Mar 27).
 
Under its Draft Master Plan 2019, which includes plans to rejuvenate the central area, URA said it will increase housing in sites such as Downtown, Marina South and Rochor so that more people can live closer to their workplaces and other amenities.
 
The plan for a larger live-in population in the office-dominated CBD and Marina Bay area is part of a move by URA to bring more life to the area after office hours.
 
"We are looking to bring in new housing options in the CBD. We want to make our CBD more vibrant, a 24/7 precinct, and housing is one of the ways where we want to bring in more people that will be living within the CBD areas," said Ms Hwang Yu-Ning, URA’s chief planner.
 

The central area also includes retail and entertainment clusters at Orchard and the Singapore River, as well as arts, cultural and heritage areas such as the Civic District, Bras Basah and Bugis.
 
Further south, the site currently occupied by Keppel Club will also be redeveloped for waterfront housing after the current lease expires in 2021, URA said.
 
The site - which is close to Telok Blangah and Labrador MRT stations - is part of the expansive 2,000-hectare Greater Southern Waterfront project stretching from Pasir Panjang to Marina East.
 
Some of the development in the Greater Southern Waterfront will begin within the next five to 10 years.
 

MORE HOUSING IN MATURE ESTATES
 
Besides the central area, new housing and amenities will be also added to the new Bayshore precinct in the Upper East Coast area, and the mature towns of Dakota Crescent and Farrer Park.
 
A park will be built along the old sea walls, which are characteristic of East Coast Park, as a reminder of its heritage.
 
When completed, the new Bayshore precinct will have two MRT stations, Bayshore and Bedok South MRT stations. It will also be a car-lite precinct, prioritising walking and cycling with a public transit street lined with shops, food outlets and amenities.
 
URA said that going forward, future residential precincts will continue to be sustainable, green, community-centric and car-lite, with easy access to a range of public spaces and amenities. Amenities will also be located in one-stop centres similar to Our Tampines Hub to make it easier for residents to shop, dine and engage in family-bonding activities under one roof.
 

For an existing mature town such as Farrer Park, new housing will open up choices for those seeking to live near the city, URA said. Familiar landmarks such as the Farrer Park Swimming Pool and former Boxing Gym will be retained, while a sports field and park that will be integrated with future housing will allow residents to bond over sports and recreational activities, said URA.
 
Dakota Crescent can expect to see more public housing, which will be planned around the six preserved Singapore Improvement Trust blocks nearby, while the iconic Dove Playground will be retained for its heritage value.
 
BRINGING JOBS CLOSER TO HOMES WITH THREE "GATEWAYS"
 
Aside from housing, three major economic gateways in the west, north and east are being planned with each anchored in a few key growth sectors. They will serve as major employment hubs.
 
The eastern gateway is centred in the Changi region to tap on the expansion of Changi Airport and its connectivity. The region comprises Changi Aviation Park and the future Changi East Industrial Zone, and will cater to aviation-related businesses.
 

Also part of the region is Changi City, which is slated to become an innovative lifestyle business cluster including Changi Business Park, Singapore University of Technology and Design, as well as the future Changi East Urban District located at the doorstep at Terminal 5.
 
The northern gateway stretches from Woodlands to Punggol and will focus on the agri-tech and food sectors, digital tech and cybersecurity sectors.
 

In Sungei Kadut, the new Agri-Food Innovation Park will be built as a pilot cluster to catalyse innovation in the agri-tech industry. The park, which is located near to farms in Lim Chu Kang and businesses in the Senoko Food Zone, forms part of a larger Northern Agri-Tech and Food Corridor.
 



In Woodlands, a new regional centre is on track to become the largest economic hub in the north over the next 15 years with spaces for business, industry, research and development, and learning and innovation.
 
New community links such as the WoodsVista Gallery and North Coast Vista will link up precincts within Woodlands and bring in more public spaces, and pedestrian and cycling infrastructure to the area.
 
To the east, the Punggol Digital District – Singapore’s first enterprise district – will see the co-location of a business park with the Singapore Institute of Technology university to help foster closer collaboration between industry and academia.
 

Tapping on Tuas Terminal’s maritime connectivity, the western gateway will be moored alongside the Jurong Lake District and Jurong Innovation District.
 
As part of the Government’s decentralisation strategy, Jurong Lake District will be the biggest business district outside the CBD while Jurong Innovation District will become a next-generation industrial district covering Nanyang Technological University, CleanTech Park, Bulim, Bahar and Tengah.
 
URA’s Master Plan is reviewed every five years and charts out the Government’s plans for land use over the next 10 to 15 years.
 
“In this master plan, we hope to have inclusive, sustainable and green neighbourhoods that will make our city more resilient in the longer term. We are also working on plans to help rejuvenate existing familiar places to make sure we bring in new vibrancy and energy to these areas,” said Ms Hwang.
 
 





URA Draft Master Plan: Going underground to free up space on the surface
 



 
SINGAPORE: The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is using special 3D technology to study the underground as a strategic resource, it said on Wednesday (Mar 27) at the launch of its Draft Master Plan 2019. 
 
The Master Plan is a blueprint that guides Singapore's development over the next 10 to 15 years and is reviewed every five years. 
 
URA said it has rolled out 3D underground maps for Marina Bay, Jurong Innovation District and Punggol Digital District, and plans to expand the pilot to include more areas.
 

Called the Special and Detailed Control Plan (SCDP), the map shows planned underground uses for each district in 3D, which can help protect planning intention. 
 
"The underground plan is part of our strategy to create spaces for the future and create capacity for growth. Providing the plans for the underground provides transparency to the developers. This is more for the shallow underground, but we are also looking at plans for the deeper caverns. That's for deeper utilities and structures that will go underground," said Ms Hwang Yu-Ning, chief planner at URA.
 
The authority is studying the possibility of freeing up surface land for people-centric uses and relocating utilities, transport, storage and industrial facilities to the underground. 
 

An example of this, she said, is the new substation in the Labrador, Pasir Panjang area, which has the capacity to power more than two public housing towns. Building the substation underground frees up three hectares of land. 
 
"The 230kV substation will go underground and that frees up ... about 3ha of land on top for a future office development. It will also free up the space for other people to enjoy rather than look at utilities above ground," Ms Hwang added. 
 
Depending on the depth, the purposes for underground spaces may vary. In shallower depths, underground connections and MRT stations can be built. Deeper spots such as the Jurong Rock Caverns can store liquid hydrocarbons like gas oil and crude oil.
 
There are two existing caverns, and JTC and PUB are conducting cavern studies. Cavern areas currently under study are Kent Ridge Hill, Tanjong Kling, Jurong West and Gali Batu.

The system always must wait for the top 20-30th percentile of new entrants to the market.
 
It has periods of waiting for them.
 
Overall up is correct, unless these new entrants earn less.

They will activate land acquisition act, you get a letter with the President logo saying  that they need back the land and will compensate you in due course.

With so many new tech parks, not surprise that the demand for office space in CBD is lower. 
So better to convert them to residential use. Continue to generate income thru land sale and stamp duty.

If they can build so much more means won't huat anymore cause plenty of land and units.On the contrary, they have shown how they can, with the stroke of a pen, increase immediate huatness by 30% or so. 
We are really almost out of land already, and I have mentioned this several times. It will be another decade or two before  the new large land sites come onstream. Desperate times call for desperate measures.
 
This measure will smoothen out supply for the next decade until these large sites are ready.

Just read the business times - only $732 psf ppr for sims drive site. 
 
This is very reasonable price for site near walking distance to aljunied mrt. 
What’s even more interesting was that Guoccoland bid price for the new plot was lower than the sims oasis land price which they had built.
If I were a new buyer interested in sims drive, I would buy this condo instead of sims oasis - only 570 units instead of 1,000 units

Sims is $687.90 (psfppr), should be higher.

Yeah... It really depends on market sentiment 
Like I say, Jadescape land bid was about 700plus psf ppr (if I recall) but the developer is marketing the units at 1,600-1700psf

If they can build so much more means won't huat anymore cause plenty of land and units.
You are right.
They going to add 20000 to the current 3000 units available in these areas, while encouraging current office developments in these areas to convert to condos/ hotels via higher plot ratios, can only mean a glut of condos down the road.  Unlikely the supply of new office space will match new housing units and not every expat likes to stay next to their office.
Condo rentals in these areas will get depressed over the long term.
I was actually eyeing one development in Tanjong Pagar but not anymore.
But new HDB developments would be a good buy.

Many places will face a large influx of new homes. 
Even the Margaret Drive region will see thousands of new homes. 
Those buying for rental income should be aware. 
The exit roads can also become choke points. 
Nevertheless it’s a highly desirable area if the price is right.

If well located, near MRT, they may have as low as 50% provision for carparks. Or lower?
 
E.g. 1000 units, only 500 carpark lots.

That would make the outskirts even worse and less desirable.
 
For those who work in the CBD, living near the office is still desirable - less commuting time, less driving time, more time with family, more free time to explore interest, gym, running etc. Just because the govt increase plot ratio doesn't mean there will be a supply glut. The building owners must bite first.
 
In Singapore, the lowest population density is in the CBD area. Supply is so scarce with only 3000 units. 20k units under the full capacity is not a lot to be honest. A typical HDB town could be 10x more. So even if the entire 20k comes online in CBD, this is still a small fraction of SG population of 5m (and growing). 
 
Great Southern Waterfront and CBD is the most exciting thing coming out of this masterplan. The rest is just bleh.

This is mainly from URA stamp duty data till mid March.
 
The transaction count should be very low now (very few sellers with buyers waiting and seeing), so the final index should not differ far.
 
Lots of uncertainties ahead. Will we see interest rate dropping again or steady or going up? Will trade reconciliation be fruitful?

What I’m saying is the previous developer (guoccoland) doesn’t even want to make a higher bid price for the new sims drive site...
Essentially what they are doing is to set a `floor’ price to protect their Sims Oasis.  If they won, they do not necessary have to sell at a lower price.  In fact, they could just sell at the same price and earn a bigger margin (ignoring higher construction costs here).  And if the market is really going south, they could average down their land cost in this area.  Win-win.   
But in the end, HL came to `support’ the land price here by bidding higher than Sims Oasis land cost.  Having said that, CDL did launch Whistler Grand at cut-throat price unexpected by the market in the West Coast area....so they can do the same here too...

I think it all depends on interest rates.. I would think price would fall further if rates goes up.
 
But now I am not sure. The current pricing can support for interest rates of around 2.4%

It really isn't as simple as just interest rates as the key driver. You're making broad assumptions that everyone takes a loan? Some may be cpf rich, some upgraders or maybe just flush with cash?  
Do you think interest rates affect buyers as much as income levels?
 
Interest rates have also gone up and down in the car market, but do you see buyers look at that as the main driver?

I am curious now what would those naysayers who kept harping that `interest rates going up, property prices will go south” now say?  No more rate increase for the rest of the year?  As for me, i have never bothered whether interest rates are up or down.  There are other more significant factors that affect property prices.

Good point. During enbloc fever opportunistic sellers asking sky prices, with some actually sold, to investors punting for enbloc windfall.Now cooling off, serious sellers would have to come back down to earth, with more realistic pricing 
 
That said ... 
https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/prime-projects-continue-see-steady-take-set-benchmark-prices
Prime projects continue to see steady take-up, set benchmark prices
 
As mentioned previously, lots of pent up demand from many years of CM, as evident from the thousands at every new launch. 
New sales numbers may not be great though, as many still on 'wait and see' from last ABSD increase and the relatively still 'high' new launch psf prices.
OCR prices will continue to remain supported from pent-up demand- HDB upgraders/investors due to lower quantum/ABSD.

I think interest rate is a bigger factor than income levels. Low interest rates allow people to buy more expensive houses than what their income can afford. Just look around this forum lah.  
If u think closely, u want to buy when interest rates are High not Low. I was betting interest rates will not go up further. The threat of rising interest did convince some sellers to drop prices to exit the market. I got my unit close to the 2017 bottom price. 
 
Of course not everyone takes a loan, but who sets the price?? The buyer who is willing to pay the highest, investors speculators, and the sellers who is willing to take the lowest, people who need to exit. Just look at why our property market moves when interest rates fell. Was it because our income went up?
 
I think another factor for the rising prices was government makes it too lucrative for enbloc. This increases the prices of old resale as people were paying a premium in anticipation for enbloc. They fixed this though with the recent measures.

I don’t think the complainers are about not getting enbloc windfalls. Most people are just not happy that enbloc seems are pushing up housing prices in general for everyone. 
 
Remember housing is not like errr bitcoin. Do people complain when they were left out of the bitcoin windfall?? No because it does not affect them. But when people speculate in housing, it affects everyone cuz everyone needs to buy a house.

More measured discussion. 
One important consideration is while everyone needs to buy a house, does everyone need to buy a private (versus HDB)?
 
So we talk about relative inelastic nature of this demand and imperfect substitutes of housing (for each other).
 
Enbloc renewal has a role to play in SG landscape both from an aesthetic and functional objective as well as investment and financial objective.

But you still loads of people queueing to buy properties. Where do these people get all the money to buy? Can't be all Rolex saleman right?

The private vs HDB is both a practical and emotion debate..
 
Private estates, well, are supposed to afford the buyer some privacy, and whether it's PC or not, also afford you some separation from the masses, for those who feel they don't want to mingle with average Joe.
There are also facilities, and these are supposed to be less crowded.
 
Emotional? Well, the same reason Mercs, BMWs and even Lexus sells. The message is I've arrived. 
 
As one Toyota hater loves to put it: the HDB is much more value for money, cost less and gives you the same surface area and number of rooms/doors and toilets.
So why do people buy these private units at twice or more?
 
I think not everyone wants or is allowed to buy HDB... 
 
Having lived and looked into some units, the insides are nice, especially the modern ones, but the difference can be vast outside your own unit. Who you live next to, where the unit is sited, what is around it etc, is much less under your control.
 
Nevertheless, each time I drive past this Tiong Bahru block, I regret not buying it :(
 
Fabulous location, and great condition but at that time, I thought 500k was expensive... oh well...

Some folks earn enough, others feel they earn enough and can borrow the rest, others feel their parents earn enough to help them, and yet others have earned enough from past sales profits to get one.
 
Cost of living? Well each time we ask for a pay rise, the cost of living goes up somehow too...

i remember sometime back in 2006 or what, when i accompany my brother to look at the different units of sale of balance bto flats on offer by hdb, one of the unit was beside a "tang ki" medium unit.  surely no one wants to stay beside him or that for matter, the units on the immediate few floors above and below his unit.
 
last time when i stayed in tampines hdb, my car also kena a full pack of chilli thrown down by a crazy hdb dweller.  i have grown wiser to avoid the few lots in same vicinity that always kena this mad man's litter......but still these are the examples that shows, why some people prefers to live in private condo.

Technically, everyone is entitled to buy resales HDB (upon a Singaporean / PR reaching 35 years old?).
 
No income cap. 
 
That explains the million dollar units...
 
Want or not, prefer or prefer not to, that is a different story.

A good percentage take up leverage as well, I myself am surprise how many people just take 80% loans and stretch it out by 25/30 years.
 
And those new launch just need to put a down payment which is small considering the the price of the property and walk away.

I think one of the reasons for our chronic over investment in property is because a significant portion of our earnings are stuck in cpf. 
Only way you can get value out of it right now is to buy property.

Still I would suggest to make sure one do value analysis properly and never over pay.
 
With the money in cpf, you still get 2.5% from government.  If you overpay buying property,  not only you may end up not making, but you still have to pay  yourself back 2.5% interest.

$1.3m business loss proves priceless for property couple
 

Q What is in your portfolio?
A My initial allocation of investment funds was 20 per cent in business and 80 per cent in property.
 
The portfolio has since evolved to business (45 per cent), properties (45 per cent) and insurance (10 per cent).
 
In terms of real estate, we own six industrial properties under our personal names, another five industrial properties via partnership with our friends, and one residential property.
 
The leasehold of our industrial properties is between 38 and 52 years.
 
Q What are your immediate investment plans?
A I will continue investing in industrial properties in Singapore to gain high returns of rental income.
 
At the same time, my company has started exploring overseas properties to provide passive income after deducting expenses. 
 
My property investment strategy will always follow these two rules, of leverage from bank loans and positive passive monthly income after expenses.

because cpf is a “compulsory” saving compulsory saving comes with compulsory interest
if you use the money for a period of time
you have to pay back the interest for “that” period of time
cpf is your money but you are governed by a set of rules
you are the true owner of the money when you withdraw at 55 and put them in your pocket
then you can blow all the money at rws/mbs or ah tiong bu! 
 
until the money is in your pocket/bank

5 Common Bits of “Fake News” About Singapore Property
 

1. HDB flat prices will always go up
 
2. Freehold condos are always better, because buyers are scared of expiring leases
 
3. You can always refinance into a cheaper loan package later
 
4. Once you turn 55, you cannot pay for your flat with your CPF
 
5. If you sell your flat for a loss, you have to “compensate” CPF when returning your sales proceeds
 
A second part to this bit of fake news: money returned this way can’t be used to buy another house, if you’re 55 or older

Far from it – though the beat might not be as fast-paced, the slowdown in the en bloc market provides a chance for developers, property owners, and even speculators to rethink their private property purchases, to shape a more sustainable residential private property redevelopment process.”

March resales reached the highest volume since the property curbs were implemented in July last year, but they are still 41.4 per cent lower than a year ago.

Condo resale prices up 3.5% in March
 
 

Prices of OCR condos rose 5.1%.
 
Private condo resale prices rose 3.5% YoY in March, according to data from SRX Property. Rates outside the central region (OCR) led the increase by 5.1% YoY.
 
Condo resale prices in the rest of the central region (RCR) and the core central region (CCR) also rose 3.1% and 0.6% YoY, respectively in March. On a MoM basis, OCR saw condo resale prices rose 1.3% whilst prices in the CCR decreased 2.1% and RCR rates remained unchanged.
 
The volume of resale condos edged up 59.3% MoM to 830 in March from 521 units resold in February. On a YoY basis, however, the units transacted were 41.4% lower compared to the 1,417 units resold in March 2018.
 
"The trend may indicate that marketing activities arising from new project launches may spur buying interest in the secondary market within the vicinity. We may expect buying interest for resale homes to pick-up further in selected locations as more projects will be launched in the coming months."

A unit sold on March 27 at Pebble Bay, on Tanjong Rhu Road in District 15, made the top gain of $2.85 million in the week of March 26 to April 2. The 2,809 sq ft, four-bedroom unit on the 15th floor was purchased for $2.26 million ($804 psf) in March 1995, and sold for $5.1 million ($1,815 psf). The seller reaped a 127% profit.
 
The second top gain made over the week – a 162% profit of $2.04 million – was at Allsworth Park, along Holland Road in District 10. The 1,959 sq ft, three-bedroom unit on the eighth floor was bought for $1.26 million ($643 psf) in April 2001, and sold for $3.3 million ($1,684 psf) on March 28. 
 
A unit sold at Casa Esperanza, on Bukit Timah Road in District 21, was the third most profitable transaction over the week, raking in a 108% profit of $1.66 million for the seller. The 2,164 sq ft, three-bedroom unit on the 10th floor was purchased in June 1999 for $1.54 million ($710 psf), and sold for $3.2 million ($1,479 psf) on March 27. 
 
 
Meanwhile the greatest loss incurred over the week was from the resale of a 2,282 sq ft unit at Orchard Scotts, off Scotts Road in District 9. Having sold the property for $3.3 million ($1,446 psf) on March 28, the seller sustained a 27% loss of $1.25 million. The unit was purchased in December 2010 for $4.55 million ($1,994 psf).

If they can only sell after TOP means they have no money coming in for first 4 years but have to pay out to contractors, suppliers, etc.

It's one thing to sell after TOP by choice because the developer as a lot of holding power and other to be forced to only sell after TOP.

I think they have the financial backing. Should not be a problem. 
The arrangement injects funds through enbloc but has no short term supply.

At this this property developer still has assets worth $$$. Of course, he takes a big risk for these 3-5 years as we don't know how property prices will move in the meantime.

Other than the first sentence, I did not understand the rest of it.
 
Can you elaborate what arrangement injects funds through enbloc? And what has no short term supply?
 
Actually, if developer goes bust there are many that will benefit. And of course, also many that will lose $.

It's not a good play for the developers. Some of the prices have been rather high, but buyers have had a kiasu mentality and have been driving prices up, even though the sentiment isn't all that fabulous.
Now when their units finally go on sale, the fire may have gone out even more.
Of course if things turn around, they can still command a premium.. but there's no MRT, no supermarket, no mall...
Great view I suppose, that's it..

Just wondering what motivates ppl who buy into the super mass market projects like the 2000 unit Treasure@Tampines or even this 1900 unit normanton park redevelopment. Both not near MRT and not exactly cheap as the enbloc owners oredi makan one round, chenghu makan another round, developer makan a BIG round, agents makan whatever leftover crumbs. Where's the upside?

i also had the same burning question.  and what's more many of them are willing to pay absd to buy.......
 
i can only guess, flushed of too much cash and being oversold or buying into the idea that whatever property one buys in singapore, one will enjoy good capital gains few years later when they sell..........look at this teasing statements from the propnex number 2.

There’s always a potential upside, it just depends on how well the economy does. 
But if you paid a lot, then you have to wait longer to reach that upside..

By then we are also looking at BTO at $1 million.
 
I personally don’t think that will be the case in 2030. 
 
2050 perhaps.

It seems buyers are accepting the new price benchmark. With new and resale volume both increasing. So developers need only hold on tight & not be too greedy will still be able to move units.Yes, higher sales YoY even after last July absd increase.

OK, while we are at HKG. I doubt we will see a repeat in SG yet, but in a years' time, the probability will rise substantially as the pent-up demand continues to build.

Hong Kong’s property buyers are back in droves, as commercial banks kept the city’s mortgage rates unchanged amid a dovish policy stance by the local monetary authority.
Across the city, four property projects with 607 flats in total were offered for sale in Lohas Park, To Kwa Wan, Yau Tong and West Kowloon in the biggest weekend launch in a year. As of 8pm, 496 of the total offering, or nearly 82 per cent, had been sold, according to sales agents.
“The purchasing power accumulated from months of pent-up demand had been released,” said Midland Realty’s residential division chief executive Sammy Po, who noted that five buyers had each bought two flats for a weekend shopping bill of between HK$12 million and HK$13 million.
 

 

Hong Kong’s property bull market had been struggling to regain its footing since prices stumbled last August following the city government’s plan to use a vacancy tax to bolster supply. The weekend’s brisk sales – combined with a slight increase in pricing – stoked concerns that housing affordability may return as a problem, after five months of cooling off.
Hong Kong home prices are back on the rise, stoked by dovish Fed
Last week, the city’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor chimed in to express her concern about housing prices, which were showing signs of revival. Hong Kong is still one of the world’s most expensive urban centres, putting housing beyond the reach of many first-time buyers and school leavers.
Still, eight months after prices began to dip, many buyers were already jumping back into the market, especially for newer projects like New World Development’s Artisan Garden project in To Kwa Wan, which drew 3,700 bids for 294 available units.

EDEN is a redevelopment of the former Hampton Court, which Swire Properties had purchased en bloc for $155 million at the end of December 2012. The price translated to a land rate of $2,526 psf per plot ratio (psf ppr), which was a record that had remained unbroken until June last year.

Homebuyers hold off purchases amid hopes of lower prices
 

More than nine months after the latest property cooling measures were implemented in July last year, homebuyers are still holding off on purchases. “Most people are not buying because they just don’t want to pay the additional buyer’s stamp duty (ABSD),”
 
Avalanche of potential upgraders
 
While the higher ABSD and tightened LTV ratio continue to impact homebuyers’ affordability, property hunters are not putting off buying a new property. “We believe there is pent-up demand building up, and we suspect that it is likely to come back,” 
 
Most of this demand will come from HDB upgraders, who have contributed to more than a third of new private home buyers for the past 24 years. “From 2019 to 2022, there will be a record number of HDB flats reaching their minimum occupation period (MOP). This means their owners will be eligible to sell the flats in the open market,”
 
In a sign that HDB owners are selling their properties, the HDB resale volume has been increasing since 2014, from 17,318 transactions to last year’s 23,099 transactions. This segment of buyers is picking up private properties due to the divergence between the price index of private properties and that of HDB properties since 2Q2017.

Since April 2018, Oxley has launched nine development projects, and the response from buyers has been “overwhelming”, according to the group’s February announcement on the Singapore Exchange.
 
With more than 1,700 units sold in residential projects in Singapore, Oxley has amassed total sales of $1.926 billion, it said in a February corporate presentation. The numbers have gone up since, especially after the group launched its latest mixed-use development, 1953, last month.
 
Three of the group’s projects – The Verandah Residences, Sixteen35 Residences, and Sea Pavilion Residences – are fully sold.
 
 
Mayfair Collection is made up of the 215-unit Mayfair Gardens and the 171-unit Mayfair Modern. More than 130 units at Mayfair Gardens have been sold since its launch last October, with average price at $1,934 psf.
Located on South Buona Vista Road, off Pasir Panjang Road, Kent Ridge Hill sold 110 units out of 250 released on Nov 10, the first day of launch.
 
Oxley also launched two mega projects, the 1,052- unit Affinity at Serangoon and the 1,427-uinit Riverfront Residences in the northeastern part of Singapore last year.
Riverfront Residences, the project is currently 64% sold. Affinity at Serangoon, as at April 15, 491 units (about 47% of the total project) have been sold at an average price of $1,507 psf.
 
1953, a mixed-use development located on the corner of Balestier Road and Tessensohn Road, was launched over the weekend of March 9 and 10. Oxley said that a total of 22 residential and three commercial units were sold that first weekend. The residential units fetched an average price of $1,875 psf, while the commercial units were sold at an average of $3,200 psf.
The boutique development contains 72 units, of which 58 are apartments and 14 are strata commercial units.

Not sure how many have picked up this portion, especially when some are questioning where the demand is coming from.  
Have also shared this previously. With the current decreasing lease value status, many will rather place their money in the private market if they can.
 
Quote from article: Most of this demand will come from HDB upgraders, who have contributed to more than a third of new private home buyers for the past 24 years. “From 2019 to 2022, there will be a record number of HDB flats reaching their minimum occupation period (MOP).

Current developer sales trend is slow and steady, not dropping prices with consistent monthly sales, many buyers still on 'wait and see' mode, doubt the take up numbers to be any impressive, as with every recent new launch.

https://www.straitstimes.com/business/property/sun-rosier-condo-fetches-271m-in-singapores-latest-en-bloc-sale
Sun Rosier condo fetches $271m in latest en-bloc sale, 15% higher than asking price
 

the condominium off Bartley Road fetched a top bid of S$271 million in Singapore's latest collective sale, about 15 per cent more than the asking price of S$235 million.
 
The offer works out to S$1,325 per sq ft per plot ratio, compared with the S$1,149 psf ppr asking price for the 146,046 sq ft site.
 
At this price, each unit owner stands to receive an estimated S$2.86 million to S$4.77 million, averaging S$1,885 psf. This is 108 per cent over the last transacted price for a unit sold early this year, or twice of what each unit could fetch if sold individually and not collectively.

https://www.straitstimes.com/business/property/how-sun-park-sold-en-bloc-for-8109m-on-third-try 

It is a case of third time lucky for owners at How Sun Park after they finally sold their estate en-bloc - reaping a knockout price in the process.
 
A unit of the SingHaiyi Group is paying $81.09 million for the freehold estate comprising a three-storey development of 20 townhouses. Owners will get about $4.05 million per unit - slightly more than twice what they would have received had their units been sold individually.
 
The price works out to $1,092 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr), inclusive of an estimated development charge of $2.92 million.
 
"The owners' reserve price was reasonable, at $70 million, which is why the site has drawn interest."

Not sure how many have picked up this portion, especially when some are questioning where the demand is coming from. 
 
Have also shared this previously. With the current decreasing lease value status, many will rather place their money in the private market if they can.
 
Agree, mentioned many times ... CMs since 2009 ... 10 years in the making ... lots of pent-up demand. 
Buyers 'wait and see' ... warchest getting bigger ... more upgraders reaching MOP ... demand ever increasing =  (((demand bubble)))

That area got so many FH/999 condos that were selling at $1.2M for a proper 3-bedroom built in the good ol'90s and without all those useless huge balcony, huge a/c ledge, window ledges, tiny bedrooms, CD shelter within the unit, no maids room, etc.
 
Why ppl prefer to buy a smaller 99LH instead from an unknown PRC developer is beyond me. At most factor in 100k for extensive reno of a resale unit and life is good...

alot of buyers will want new, fresh lease and everything new and don't mind paying more. Lease is very sensitive to them.

alot of buyers will want new, fresh lease and everything new and don't mind paying more. Lease is very sensitive to them.Lease is not a factor for FH/999. But I can see the rationale for preferring new. Now enbloc and buy new, earn money and avoid hefty repairs for old buildings. 
That said, even for FH, for those which have already enbloc once for example in early 2010s and achieved TOP in mid 2010s. 20-30 years later, when the condo ages, what are the chances of enbloc again? 
 
Given the high prices now, to enbloc again in future will be even more expensive. They'd have no choice but to fork out high sums of money for big repairs. If the sinking fund is not enough, good luck to the owners.

All things being equal, of course prefer new lah
 
I'm referring to the hillview area where kingsford simisai condo is located. Got so many FH/999 not-too-old condos there that wasn't caught in devaluation of usable space from around the mid-2000s onwards. I would rather pay for actual usable space than paying more for tiny bedrooms, tiny kitchen, HUGE balcony, HUGE a/c ledge, CD shelter, etc

One will need to study how the plot ratio and GFA is adjusted over time, in order to answer your question.
 
There is no choice but to adjust the GFA ratio 30 years later. A better set of questions will be:
 
1. What are the incomes people should be earning 30 years later?
 
2. What are the implications if Singapore comprises only old and dilapidated private properties (i.e. not possible to enbloc)?
 
3. Why are private property prices always high? They were high 10, 20 even 30 years ago based on the respective incomes of those in that era, relative to other options such as HDB. Would there be a time when they are considered cheap relative to HDB?

.....as it states that someone bought a 829sf unit n lives there w his wife, 2 children and in-laws! Not sibei cramped meh?
829 sqft still have to minus ac ledge/balcony, less living space. And only 2 bedder, not ideal to fit 4 adults 2 kids comfortably. 
As mentioned always ... 'go resale for better value'
1.2mil can easily get a decent size resale 3 bedder, best is what you see what you get, no hidden surprises with quality/workmanship, less headache. 
Or just put in another 50-100k can reno swee swee to 'brand new'
 
If preference still for new, source for those recent TOP projects resale, again what you see what you get. As first mover in, as good as brand new. 
Why pay the high psf asking of developers with uncertainty on end product?
 
But thats just my take on it, as they say ... diff strokes diff folks.

I have a friend who moved from a 5 room flat into a 2 bed condo, which was 40% smaller. With a maid and two kids, and the occasional parent visiting..
The allure of private housing was greater than his need for space I guess. YMMV
 
I moved into a larger home so everyone has their own space. No regrets.

Property: Are executive condominiums worth buying?
 

The next EC launch - in Sumang Walk - is expected to be later this year. Due to the low supply, EC prices have steadily increased. A unit at Northwave was sold in January for S$864 per square foot (psf), a 15 per cent increase from the project's median price of S$751 psf when it was launched back in July 2016.
 
the Sumang Walk site sold at a record S$583 psf ppr to City Developments Limited (CDL) and TID Residential. Reports have estimated the breakeven price for the development to be almost S$1,000 psf.

If HSR no go, can still proceed with JLD 2nd cbd. 
May not be a bad thing afterall, Jurong already super crowded during peak hours, so can you imagine the surge in human traffic with the rail.
So i wouldnt sweat over it for those vested there. I think will still be a go, after some wayang from the other side, just more further delays now to start.

Its a good condo, with a solid location.
Take note of mossies on the lower floors, and the state of the plumbing - be prepared to spend but it's worth it, esp if you get a unit at a good price.
Recent transactions have priced in the MRT, the MGS 1km location... but it's still good. Or get the Sterling nearby, good place too.

I stayed in (the old) JW for 27 years. 
Parc Oasis was the first nice pte condo to be built in the JW/JE area.
 
The name of the condo is idyllic, the design was ahead of it's time I feel. I always gawk at it from the Upper Deck of Bus 334 otw to JE MRT.
 
It remains one is my favorites because it was built in the era (90s) which was one of the best in my life and it was one of my aspirations.
 
But now, CCK also not bad lah. At least it's unblocked.

The problem is the 28% don’t own any property and the 72% owns several... 
“In fact, 64 percent were able to acquire a home at current prices and within their current incomes, while 27 percent intend to purchase a home in the following year.”
 
At most it’s 1% (28-27%) who can sell to the remaining 72%.

Super agreed, thats why for SG property ... 'always good to be in the game as early as possible'Those bought and held on prior CMs, not only got in at 'cheap' psf prices ... no ABSD! 
 
Just look at URA future plans for SG, too many to name ... think where property prices to be heading? Gonna be cheaper or more expensive in future? 
Better to buy ASAP or keep waiting? 
 
Its actually pretty obvious and clearcut, naysayers will just continue to nitpick. Wanna be the 28% ... or the 72% to keep chasing prices?

Agreed, assuming avg 1.5mil unit DP 30-50%, loan amount 750k-1mil a hefty burden next 25-30 years, which is a very long debt period.And with added ABSD not helping matters, pushing upgraders/buyers to go for smaller units, not healthy.

Private home rents recover with 1% rise in Q1; vacancy rate dips to 6.3% : URA
 

Rents of landed properties increased by 0.2 per cent in the January to March quarter, compared with the 2.1 per cent drop in the previous quarter. Rents of non-landed properties increased by 1.1 per cent, compared with the 0.8 per cent decline in the prior quarter.
 
The vacancy rate of completed private residential units (excluding ECs) dipped to 6.3 per cent at the end of the first quarter of this year, down a notch from 6.4 per cent in the previous quarter.
 
Another bright spot, was a decrease in vacancy rates of completed private residential homes (excluding ECs) for six consecutive quarters, to a five-year low of 6.3 per cent.

This is underpinned by low completion volumes until 2021.
 
Vacancies, which also fell to their lowest in more than five years, also helped rents, as the fall in new completions of private homes outpaced that of net absorption.
 
 "For the rest of 2019, leasing market conditions would be tilted to favour landlords due to falling supply but rental increase could be moderated by less favourable economic and business conditions, which may have an impact on hiring and rental budgets."

The project is designed by award-winning architect and principal of SCDA Architects, Chan Soo Khian, famous for designing many of the luxury projects in Singapore, especially in prime Districts 9 and 10.
 
SCDA is also the landscape architect for the project. As the three residential towers occupy a footprint of just 35%, the rest of the site is freed up for facilities and landscaping. The first level is designed as a contemporary luxury resort with facilities such as a 50m lagoon pool, lagoon cove and private dining at Club Amber clubhouse. Amber Park’s total recreational space is the largest among new developments in the East Coast and Katong area.

For new launch, SOP to ask for blank cheque as EOI. Its a numbers game, collect more cheques higher chance for sales. 
Even more super hard sell now (there's a previous article developer up comm for agents from 1-2% to 3-5%), every sale they can close agent super huat.

Like this?  
https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/lure-seven-year-guarantee-citadines-berawa-beach-bali
The lure of the seven-year guarantee: 
 

The developer is offering investors is a guaranteed rental return (GRR) of 5% for seven years, with no lock-in period, and also absorbing the withholding tax of 10% on the GRR of 5% for the entire seven-year period.
 
Full payment, 5% return
 
The developer is offering three payment schemes: full payment with a 15% discount; progressive payment with a 10% discount; and a seven-year payment scheme with a 5% discount.
 
The studio suites start from $230,000, the equivalent of just the downpayment for a condo in Singapore or some properties in the more mature markets.
Definitely, as with any investment foreign or domestic, the usual rule applies ... high risk high return.For locals, nothing beats having the knowledge and assurance of 'home ground advantage'

If 20K with 3 kids 2 studying in uni and one in the army, the cost goes really fast. Even faster if overseas uni.
 
If 20 K sole bread winner, the risk exposure is worst.
 
So it all depends

 hearsay, a wise woman said ah gong love ah seng deep deep
where is my sinkie dream ... 
 
When I was in school, I used to think that by age 30, I would be married, have 2 kids and live in a big landed house. Basically, I envisioned myself living the Singaporean Dream, something our meritocratic society taught me to think was very possible as long as I worked really, really hard.

previously, alot of people who could afford a condo, buys condo as its easier to sell. No restrictions on condo to FT
 
Nowadays with the restrictions of number of cars to a condo, the landed became more popular.

Actually it’s because enbloc money chases space especially for own stay. 
Modern condo space is just too costly. So end up chasing older landed space with much lower psf.

I don't think it's that exaggerated lah. But 20k pm is a comfortable sum depending on your needs. Just that its nothing much in the context of housing asset prices.

For new launch, SOP to ask for blank cheque as EOI. Its a numbers game, collect more cheques higher chance for sales.
 
Even more super hard sell now (there's a previous article developer up comm for agents from 1-2% to 3-5%), every sale they can close agent super huat.
 
Huat ah!  
https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/property-management-news/2019/4/179738/home-prices-to-hold-steady-despite-property-cooling-measures
Home Prices To Hold Steady Despite Property Cooling Measures
 

This comes as most developers launching new projects this year had paid high prices for land during the en bloc fever that commenced at around May 2017.
 
Developers will also be more willing to maintain prices and accept a lower sell-down rate rather than resort to discounting, which may devalue the overall project as well as disappoint earlier buyers who forked out higher prices.
 
Some developers may be incentivised to resort to heavy discounting to sell all remaining units within five years of being awarded the land in order to recoup the remissible portions of developer’s Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD), which is sizable at 25 per cent (an increase from the previous 15 per cent). However, Teo shares that the number of developments that will reach the five-year deadline from now till 2020 is relatively low, with less than 200 units in total.
 
Instead of steep offering discounts, he expects developers to position their projects more competitively moving forward, especially in view of the large supply of properties in the pipeline.
 
Aside from early bird discounts, developers may offer higher sales commissions to agents as well as deferred payment arrangements for completed project in order to boost sales.

Definitely, as with any investment foreign or domestic, the usual rule applies ... high risk high return.
For locals, nothing beats having the knowledge and assurance of 'home ground advantage'
 More buying after ABSD increase?  Chiong ah!

Private Home Acquisition By Singaporeans Soar In Q1 2019
 

Singaporeans’ share of local home purchases rose the highest in a decade versus foreigners, with 79 percent of private apartments snapped up by locals during the first quarter of 2019.
 
In fact, the proportion of locals acquiring luxury homes soared 69 percent from 36 percent over the same period last year.
 
“The rising number of affluent locals purchasing luxury homes indicates their confidence that Singapore remains a safe haven for capital preservation and appreciation,” 
 
The highest number of sales for super-luxury new condos, or those priced over $3,500 per sq ft (psf) was also registered in Q1 2019 after more than a decade. A penthouse within a development close to the Orchard Road shopping district was sold for $28 million or $4,927 psf.

That's not a bad idea..
Buy a resale HDB 5 room with 1400-1500 sq ft of space for under 900k in a good location.
150k to renovate to make a palace. 
1.5m left to buy a couple of Mercs, go on annual holidays and invest..
 
But hey, everyone knows how to/ can do that but not everyone can buy a 2.5m property ... that requires a different level. 
 
Having no block number on your address, speaks volumes... being able to say you don't get any government vouchers or handouts can be considered a badge of honor ;)
 
Jokes aside
More importantly for most folks who get landed:
The space, the privacy and your own little castle. 
I think most don't get it for the moniker.

There is some truth about what she says, but I want to give a balance perspective of her opinion.
 
Propnex has been pushing the sell one buy 2 strategy for years.  While I don't  advocate that myself, I know many Propnex agents do.  Many of my cobrokes are from Propnex and they are good agents.  A lot of their clients especially the early ones have benefited from that strategy and it has contributed greatly to the growth of Propnex from a local agency to now a SGX listed company.
 
But like any good strategy, it can be bad if it is overuse or not being assess carefully.  Panadol can be quite useful, but if you over consume it or use it in a wrong way, it can still be dangerous. The new agents who embark this strategy in social media now has to be careful  and skilled in financial planning before  recommendation because ABSD, stamp duty and even the deposit has all gone up quite significantly in terms of dollar value.
 
As for owning 34 properties kind of methods, please stay away. Trust me, I have probably attended much more of such seminars than the lady in the video above, and none of it is sound to me. I don't even want to discuss that path.
 
I like the fact that she raises some alarm on  these properties hype in social media ads.  But not all are bad please. I also use FB ads to promote my free ebook on what are the best bargains new launches today and it teaches how one can do simple valuation exercises to find good bargains. There is nothing snake oil in there.

Amber Park could launch sales on 4 May
 

Amber Park by City Developments and Hong Realty opened its doors for viewing on the weekend. According to DBS Group Research, which visited the weekend viewings, the developer is confident to launch sales on 4 May with an indicative price starting from $2,160 psf.
 
DBS Group Research analyst Rachel Tan observed a steady crowd during her Sunday AM/PM visits. She said, “We understand that it was a lot more crowded on Saturday. Judging by the BMWs, Merc, Porsches and even a Maserati at the parking lots, we believe that the project launch has attracted the attention of the ‘well-heeled’ and discerning property buyers in Singapore.”

There are many websites, media, and even experts talking about the glowing market. But I advise caution. Are these units worth that kind of psf? What’s the upside?
Or buyers are just convinced they will lose out if they don’t buy and that someone will buy at a higher price?

Its all about sustainability, and sometime avoid being the last one holding the baby when the music stops.
 
Music , from what I know has a habit of turning off immediately, while those that are holding the inventory are singing a different tune to say it simply slowing down, does not mean the music will stop, it wlll pick up again, just like every other year.
 
Most in the industry are starting to worry about some of the new launches and even more so by the lack of take up rate due to the cost of the land that was bidded.
 
While I do like the fact that any nearby plot of land is develop at a much higher rate and therefore, pushing up the prices for those that are owning the older property, it does no one any good if the bubble burst.
 
I would imagine the 1000PSF default benchmark would move to 1200psf YOY a 10 to 20% uplift. But is that sustainable.?
 
Unless wage growth has a componded increase, we are going to be the next australia and to a lesser extend, Malaysia.
Yup. The high bid price just made things less than rosy. And some are players from China before their rivers of cash flow affected by their govt.  
Demand n supply. Comes and goes. But i feel that the enbloc sales generate quite a few millionaires overnight, that is, if they have mostly paid up their existing loan with property. 
 
Was it 5,200 of these from all the enbloc sales closed the past 2 years?
 
Guess quite a few new launches not enjoying high take up rates. There was a time where some new launches experienced 100% sold within months. History for now i guess.
 
Thanks for sharing 
 
Safe ride

to be fair, when i shared the video, i also did not completely target the propnex agents.  what happens is the recently my facebook has been bombarded by the ads from these 2 self-styled property investor leader, Mark Ong and Germaine Chow (the one who claimed they owned 34 properties, and she was also featured in the sunday times invest column 3 weeks ago).  I got irritated, done some research and figured out what type of soup they are cooking up in their pot.  in fact their lineage can be traced back to another such self styled leader wendy kwek, who made a pile of money at the expenses of her investor followers.  i really cautioned all investors to fall for the glamourous marketing puffs and invest with these self-styled investor leader.
 
at the same time, i saw someone post this video link to debunk them and thought the video correctly sums up most of the gimmicky advertisement headlines in their ads.  it is unfortunate also that the propnex agents were mentioned in the same breath in the same video.  i had in fact been very close to 1 propnex agent who also helped me with such asset progression plan few.  hence, it is never in my intention to brand the propnex agents as scammers.  however, to be objective, i do feel the propnex agent tend to oversell this aspect of their service these days and became more focused on selling rather than planning for the capital appreciation for their clients.  for example, now almost every project kelvin fong and his entourage marketing, they also claims it is good buy.  i tend to disagree with them that there are so many good buys and felt they are guilty of churning to some extent.
by the way, which agency do you belong to?  i find you are one of the most objective real estate agent i have seen thus far.  you are neither too biased to sell as an agent nor too reticent in suggesting suitable timing and projects to look at.

Sadly, many things are done out of desperation to earn money.
Some will be more ethical. Others fear the consequences. 
A doctor can be taken to task for writing a memo to the wrong person.
A peeping tom can get a slap on the wrist.
A property agent? If he tell you the property will appreciate in value or that the price he is offering is rock bottom and it isn't, is there any recourse?
 
If not, then it will simply be his / her moral compass that determines whether he is ethical. And not all are.

at the same time, i saw someone post this video link to debunk them and thought the video correctly sums up most of the gimmicky advertisement headlines in their ads.  it is unfortunate also that the propnex agents were mentioned in the same breath in the same video.  i had in fact been very close to 1 propnex agent who also helped me with such asset progression plan few.  hence, it is never in my intention to brand the propnex agents as scammers.  however, to be objective, i do feel the propnex agent tend to oversell this aspect of their service these days and became more focused on selling rather than planning for the capital appreciation for their clients.  for example, now almost every project kelvin fong and his entourage marketing, they also claims it is good buy.  i tend to disagree with them that there are so many good buys and felt they are guilty of churning to some extent.
by the way, which agency do you belong to?  i find you are one of the most objective real estate agent i have seen thus far.  you are neither too biased to sell as an agent nor too reticent in suggesting suitable timing and projects to look at.

 
this is germaine chow.

I am not sure how fellow forummers will identify and agree with what I share here.
 
Personally, I feel that based on all traditional stats and calculations (income, GDP, employment, low or no corruption, sharing of economic benefits and growth), all classes of housing are underpriced in SG. HDB, condo, landed, all are underpriced at all locations (IMO).
 
When the inherent values are recognised and acknowledged resulting in price increases, the Govt wedges in cooling measures. Such measures may limit the growth of future selling prices of the properties bought, but they do not really affect the inherent worth or value of the property bought and adopted as a home or an investment instrument.
 
What a buyer needs to do is to understand his own situation thoroughly and identify the actual purpose of the purchase, and make the most optimal decision to buy the most underpriced property most optimised for her / her / their situations. To me, what's more important in buying SG property is self discovery rather than identify what is the best buy or when is the best time to buy according to experts. As one man's meat is another's poison, what is excellent for one might be unsuitable for another.
 
When one identifies and clarifies the actual intention and purpose for buying, then one goes into discovering the type, location and price of property most in line with that intention. The self-discovery stage, if omitted, will most likely result in huge disappointments even if one had the best buy ever.
 
For example, if I had opted for a FH landed some 7 years ago, my appreciation by last year should be larger as compared to the two condo units I had bought. But the rents from two condos consistently are higher than the landed, and my intention is to continue to deploy them for rental and modest appreciation for a good 10-20 years more. Moreover, by this year (2019), the appreciation plus rent of 2 condos (minus maintenance) has overcome the appreciation plus rent of that 1 landed.
 
But for one buying to stay, landed may indeed be a better choice. Or it might not due to other personal reasons. So embark on that journey of self-discovery soon to correctly evaluate all your choices.

It might sound that way, but as I have also clarified before, the new generations may not need or be willing to pay for such spaces.
 
The virtual world may be more important and relevant for them. Most important is router and TV on the wall!
 
No need for bookshelves, gigantic TV consoles, altars etc... Even kitchen can be omitted because everything Foodpanda or Grab delivery. Carpark lots also don't need because it is fashionable for some of them not to drive, and this is a reality for some.
 
Those who need that space, there are always other options (older landed or HDBs) for consideration.

actually i am mostly agreeing with you.  that properties in singapore are by and large undervalued and having room to appreciate.
 
what i don't agree is with the agents calling buys on all properties they market at all times.  the investor has limited resources, they can only afford to buy 1 property say over the next 10 years.  hence, it would be more proper for the property advisor to help pick a reasonably good time for a good buy instead of advising like as if all the time is good for investing and almost all properties are similarly good for capital appreciation and also not putting absd considerations into the equation for advice.

I think agents will definitely push their agenda. 
 
As stated, sometimes we really have no idea when was the best time to buy... Upon retrospect, the best time to buy in the last 10 years was actually 2009. And was 2013 the worst year to buy? 
 
But we can check transactions that saw people buying properties in 2009 suffer huge losses (Sentosa?) and 2013 with huge gains...
 
And others who bought in 2009 but are unsatisfied with their buys (stuck by CMs from purchasing more etc) and those who are perfectly happy with what they bought in 2013.
 
So self-discovery I feel. What does one actually need? DYODD...

Yup. The high bid price just made things less than rosy. And some are players from China before their rivers of cash flow affected by their govt.
 
Demand n supply. Comes and goes. But i feel that the enbloc sales generate quite a few millionaires overnight, that is, if they have mostly paid up their existing loan with property.
 
Was it 5,200 of these from all the enbloc sales closed the past 2 years?
 
Guess quite a few new launches not enjoying high take up rates. There was a time where some new launches experienced 100% sold within months. History for now i guess.
 
Thanks for sharing
 
Safe ride
Cheers

 
well in the early 2000s it was like that till the flood gates were opened in 2005.

My guess is one of the following:
 
1. Buying into a company that owns 34 properties (either become a co-owner or help the owners pay the taxes) 
 
2. Buying a mixture of non-residential properties or building with 34 non-residential units.
 
3. Buying into a company or land to develop 34 properties somewhere.
 
4. Buying foreign properties linked to one of the options above with residential options, some with time stay options, etc etc.

I think most likely they bought into a REIT heavily for passive income shared.

@kusje  @showster
that's what i guess they do:
 
1) buy industrial or commercial property because no absd
2) old industrial property are quite cheap, because the remaining lease very short, could cost $500k only
3) leverage and maximise loan on these property.  loan to valuation for such properties are way higher than residential.that is how they achieved "little or no money down"
4) some of the properties may be parked under a company owned by few shareholders.  so although they could be owning only 10% of 1 property, they can lay claim to owning 10 properties (of 10% each)
5) for those that claimed they upgrade to landed house or porsche, my guess is that they already have the means to buy such property on their own accord.  they only lend their story to the advertiser to help them due to their close friendship
6) some of the old industrial property could indeed fetch 6-7% rent now..but take note that low potential of capital appreciation and if can't find tenant, it will be a costly investment instead
7) the sunday times on last sunday, featured some individual buyers of medical suite offices thinking they could earn steady stream of lucrative rental income but got burnt because cannot find tenants.

I think agents will definitely push their agenda.

you got a point there also.  but as i feel most of such layman investors don't have the knowledge of sophistication and are looking up to agents' advice, the agents could have done better putting more effort into a good tailored advice.
 
hehe what does dyodd stands for?  do your own due dligence or do your own detailed decipher?

I was thinking actually all these small rooms is actually not a good use of space. Example bedroom, if u increase the space a little you can put in a table for study. My kid room needs a table for study else you expect him to do his work on the bed? To me, it’s just not practically. By chopping up the space into very small rooms u are actually making it harder to utilise them effectively.

In stocks, it stands for Do Your Own Due Diligence. An agent will never be able to advise if the space is sufficient for you, whether and how many family members should stay with you, how long you should or intend to hold on to the property, etc etc.
 
Even the so-called "expensive" BUC (new) properties could be value propositions depending on the intention of deployment.
 
To be honest, I bought at times when the PSF of a new property are pretty close to the surrounding resales options. That was why I chose what I chose.

Some condos allow one to build loft beds.
 
An alternative is to fix tables on the walls that can be assembled when needed. Or to buy a foldable table from furniture shop. Nobody said it has to be a fixed table.
 
Or get a study table cum bed (one level higher) furniture from Ikea. Super cosy.
 
My views only.

It is good that the snake oil peddlers get exposed. I have no issue with that.
 
As for me, I am not from Propnex.  It doesn't matter where I am from but I appreciate your comments abt me. However, "being objective" often does not translate to income in this industry.  People loves shiny objects like "how to buy 34 properties" and think value-analysis (which I specialise in and is a proven sound method in optimal wealth creation for property investment) is boring.   But I stand firm on my objectivity and ethics. It is better to make less money than to go to bed not able to sleep.
 
Anyway the sell 1 buy 2 strategy is not easy to implement thesedays because of the higher upfront cost due to CM. If any agents are to peddle that, ask for the full financial status and mortgage repayment schedule for each of the buyer (often husband and wife). If the report look sound, ask to cut the estimated loan amount by 15% and see if it is still viable to buy a suitable property for both. I have a software that simulates this strategy. I don't actively advocate this strategy but because clients always ask, I took the trouble to find a vendor who sell such software (with updated CM measures)  so that I can check for them for free before they get hype up by this strategy.
 
Whether sell 1 buy 2 or sell 1 buy 1, the key is not the strategy. The key is whether did you buy at fair/good value? Ask your agent to justify value for whatever they are selling. And please don't accept reasons like next door is selling $xxx psf so this property at $yyy must be good value. That's pure nonsense unless he can show that both $xxx psf and $yyy psf are not  overprice to begin with.

For own stay it still may not be that suitable (again depends on one's family makeup).
 
But indeed for rental, it was and might still be a superior choice.

yes, there is a cantonese idiom that has it if one is too honest and ethical, one ends up not able to bring home the bacon..unfortunate but sad fact in life.  but still i agree with you that it is better to earn less and be able to sleep during bedtime knowing you have not misled your customers into a bad choice of purchase.
 
hehe on your last para, yes there is a lot of half baked snake-oil peddling agents who simply use such line of reasoning to convince us to buy or sell........

From numbers perspective yes...but question is, can one get a good tenant profile for geylang?  If you run into tenancy issues like payment arrears, vice activities, noisy tenants, inconsiderate tenants, damage house, etc.....the energy and effort depleted in managing such issues may not be so worthwhile after all.

SingHaiyi’s The Gazania and The Lilium sell 15% of launched units over first day of sales
 

Singapore-listed property developer SingHaiyi Group has announced that it has sold 23 units (15%) out of 165 units that were launched for sale from its twin residential projects – The Gazania and The Lilium. The first day of sales over the Labour Day holiday attracted more than 200 prospective home buyers for the balloting.
 
The 250-unit The Gazania features one- to four-bedroom unit types including four-bedroom maisonette units, while the 80-unit The Lilium comprises two- to four-bedroom units and penthouses. Larger-sized units saw more interest from home owners, with more than 70% of the home buyers purchasing three- to four-bedroom units, including a penthouse unit.

330units in total only 23 units sold?? that is just horrible.
 
From past launches we know there is a significant rate of default for new sales.... to beef up the numbers.
 
but 23 units is really low. They scared URA investigate them?
 
next up is Amber. Let's see how many units they can sell. All these developers bidded for land before the cooling measures in 2018.... 
 
I think they also know it will be hard to sell now as almost all enbloc failed after CM 2018. It will be interesting to see what happens...

She is not a normal someone.
 
She has been complaining for years about every way (especially less ethical ones) the property market has been blossoming in recent years, since around 2011 when she sold all her properties except her home to cash out on the "opportunity" of a crash that never came.
 
She also organised talks, seminars, YouTube videos, and had newspaper articles published on her views about the "crash", and I am certain she has had her fair share of rotten eggs thrown at her by now. She had been less vocal recently - so that's where she went...

If the newer land sales are cheaper, it will be even harder for them to compete 1-2 years down the road.

Basically kicking the can down further.

even it is ... the developer still price at market rate $psf
because cost may also gone up in tandem with inflation
and why sell cheap?
unlike goods that we can buy from taobao 
local developers can play with the local market
unless the pool of buyers totally dried up
but the news show buyers demand are healthy

i remember the days when geylang properties were so cheap and yet their rental returns are higher than most other rcr apartments....it helps to take a look at things objectively without bias or coloured lenses.  i have to admit i missed the boat for that one. 
 
ever try selling one or taking a loan for one ?
 
Interestingly... I supposed most are the miss the boat type or NATO who wants to participate in Lunch time discussion.

Singaporeans spend triple the time searching for property than reading their children bedtime stories or speaking to their parents
 
Calling property a “national sport for Singaporeans”, HSBC said on Thursday (May 2) that its Beyond the Bricks 2019 survey found that Singaporeans spend 3.29 hours every week on property-related window shopping. That includes searching for property online and reading property magazines even when they are not looking to buy a new home.
In comparison, the respondents spent just slightly more than an hour (1.03 hour) reading their children bedtime stories, and less than an hour (0.94 hour) talking to their parents every week.
The global survey of 11,000 people across 10 countries and territories, including 1,000 respondents in Singapore, polled respondents on their attitudes towards home ownership and financing a home.
Not only are Singaporeans highly active property shoppers, a large 75 per cent of first-time home buyers view five or less homes before deciding on one.
Slightly more than one-third (36 per cent) are impulsive and buy properties based purely on first impressions. This is lower than the global 39 per cent.
 
Impulse purchases are even more pronounced among extreme Singaporean property addicts who spend over 7 hours a week reading about or researching property, HSBC said. Around 51 per cent of these “addicts” admit to buying a property on first sight while 63 per cent of them did not have any criteria to adhere to when shopping for a property.

yes, which brings me back to my experience previously with the agents marketing echelon back in 2012/2013.  when i visited the showroom, they were showing me all the land bid price comparison of their project, vs Alex Residences and The Crest.  i feel their marketing talk is somewhat underhanded, as they keep asking me how much premium Alex and The Crest will sell over Echelon given the premium they paid in land bid prices over Echelon. bearing the brunt of their attack is the Alex, because its land bid price is close to 200psfppr above that of Echelon.  nevertheless, i didn't buy echelon nor alex nor the crest.  but from hindsight now, i can definitely say, alex selling price in psf terms is actually quite close to Echelon prices.  put simply, the so-called projected premium selling price didn't materialise mainly because their developer sold at much lower margin because the timing of their launch is less favourable than Echelon.  It does show that land bid price doesn't have a direct correlation to the selling price, especially given that the time of winning the bid vs the time of sales launch would still have a window period of several months.  it only shows that developers are profit maximisation driven and will price the highest possible when it can still move units, while land bid price sets the floor, it doesn't set the selling price.

Base on your logic, why there all the enbloc failed recently? If everyone can sell, just bid higher. The fact that the bidding cooled down a lot is the best proof that Developers have no confidence of being able to price it higher.
 
 If more and more land bids are closed at a lower price, I think the developers will try to sell Low to clear their stock to avoid competing with the new lower priced launches.

The developers may not have confidence to price higher than the market price now. But does not mean they will sell lower now. Until the situation turns for the worse or they are forced to (eg ABSD deadline).
 
And they want enbloc prices to be much lower than what sellers are prepared to sell for now to give bigger margin of error. Hence the standstill.
 
If they get their land cheap, they need not sell cheap too.
 
Because if one developer breaks ranks & sell lower, the neighbouring project may have to write down their project, triggering a wave of marked to market adjustment.
 
No one wants to be the bad guy.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-21/the-real-crazy-rich-asian-palace-is-worth-a-cool-3-5-billion
 
 
In the heart of Singapore, one of the most expensive cities in the world, there’s a sprawling, vacant plot of private land 30 times the size of The White House.
Just down the road from the U.S. embassy and bordering condos worth S$4.5 million ($3.3 million) each, the swathe of untended jungle hides the remains of two abandoned palaces and would be worth a cool $3.5 billion if sold for development, according to one estimate. In a city where almost 8,000 people are crammed into each square kilometer and real estate prices are among the world’s highest, it is one of the greatest urban anachronisms in Asia.

Not surprising what......just look at MCF Property thread...already how many hundred pages if you add all the Parts (now at Part III)
 
Property discussion here probably hotter than any car threads. Maybe MCF should do a MPF, guarantee make more money than running a car forum.
 
If really setup MPF, please let me be the resident license agent......I contributed a lot leh.....

Echelon launched the day before CM was announced (ABSD 10%)
 
Very high price, studios 1800->2000pfs , but good development, looks better than Alex
 
There are still more buyers who sold at profit than loss and rental looks strong too in weak market
 
Crest is across the road further away from MRT, premium lower
 
So u are right, many factors involved

The key is not to wait for crash. 
 
The key is to learn how to identify value and buy only those.
 
In my line, I met so many owners who buy based on hype and emotions. They have no idea how to find value thinking that value = the value the bank is willing to give loan. 
 
In today's market, there are so many resale units selling  at good value. For savvy buyers, it is boom time.
 
For new launches, there are quite a few selling at good value. But most are overprice. You just need to know which ones.

Waiting for crash in an unregulated (near 0 cooling measures) environment (1997, 2002, 2008 for example) has proven to be rather fruitful for those who can wait.
 
But waiting for crash in an environment laden thick with cooling measures is really a futile exercise. If the bull can still tiptoe forward chained, whipped and strapped, what does it tell us about its inherent vitality?
 
The inflexibility and rigidity will cause many golden opportunities to be lost.

If investors, will need close to 3000pfs just to even off for the next Bull run

Echelon launched the day before CM was announced (ABSD 10%)
 
Very high price, studios 1800->2000pfs , but good development, looks better than Alex
 
There are still more buyers who sold at profit than loss and rental looks strong too in weak market
 
Crest is across the road further away from MRT, premium lower
 
So u are right, many factors involved

 
are you in the property lne or you are an owner?  i would say more sold at losses than gains instead although i am not a property agent who painstakingly keep tabs on gains and losses, i would say at least this is the impression i got looking at the transacted prices vs the prices during the sale then.  even perusing the x-value indicator tool offered by srx, it also tells me most units sold at a loss.  
 
crest is completely different ball game because their units are mostly significantly bigger units.
 
i haven't been into echelon after it TOP, so i reserve comments if it is better built.

Neither an owner nor agent
But was there at echelon launch (very memorable because of the huge crowd, lucky draw, heavy rain and lighting that day) and after its TOP
Units were sold at profits at TOP, that what agents said then  
Very surprised because units were bought a very high pfs, if recall correctly, verified two units and turned out to be true
 
Even for last 6 months, there were 4 profits vs 3 losses (source:squarefoot research)
 
Echelon, well built and very solid (externally), finishing inside units was generally good. 
 
On hind side, those who bought at those high pfs probably made a decent investment
 
The point is that there are so many factors involved in prices among condos that are of similar age in same area
 
Echelon was one of the first of several condos in that redhill belt. Despite high pfs, prices have generally held quite up well because of the development quality and convenience and MRT. 
 
For Crest, other than bigger units, one issue with some buyers is one has to cross the bridge/road to get to MRT

For Echelon, prices didn't really appreciate since 2013.  It launched at the average  of $ 1794 psf. Today, Echelon avg $psf is $1724.
 
Yes, it did held up quite ok, but if any owners were to have profit, I don't think it is significant. You probably have the same amount of losers since the avg $psf didn't really gain over the last 6 years.

ya I don't know why car50 say it is a decent investment as it obviously did not appreciate much.
 
I guess don't lose money is good enough? I think it is hard to find people who made significant profit buying into all these new 99 year condo that is launched 2012 and later.

Ego? Maybe vested so cannot lose face? Anyway, it’s simple math, make money means make money. Lose means lose.  But if it’s a home, then less important if it makes you happy living there.

"Decent investment" used in the context that despite its high selling pfs, owners assets still holding up well
 
e.g those who bought the smaller units from 800 plus k to 1m, yield 3-3.4% (2.5k rental) and sellers asking sale prices also high
 
At launch, thought not a good investment at that price.  
 
Duo residence  (launched in end 2013) is another example that despite high 2000-2500pfs (ave 2000plus) , prices and rentals holding up well too
 
This one sure more profits than losses so far
 
Maybe Amber Park may surprise us too when TOP    even though logic says otherwise

Ssd was implemented since 2010. It is quite unlikely those first batch made profit after paying the ssd. 
Can you point me to the square foot data? I am interested to see how they compile it.

Since we are discussing about Echelon, let me reveal a few more data
 
In 2012 a year before Echelon started selling,  D3 LH has an avg $psf of $1317
 
Then Echelon started selling in January 2013 at avg $1794 psf for the whole of  2013
 
That's a 36% premium over the District just a year before. With CM in place, there is no way they are going to have good appreciation between 5-10 years when the premium is 36%!
 
Now, if we look at Amber Park, average $psf for D15 FH/999 today is $1566. Amber Park is $2425. 
 
I leave it to you guys to calculate the premium here and draw conclusion yourself. Maybe these investors knew something that I do not know.

As mentioned prior ... 'many enbloc billions coming back into the market' 
So my guess some to be enbloc millionaires, previously staying in that area.
 
This being FH, meaning can keep long term, so not just psf upside, could be long term rental yield or for the children ... or all the above

As mentioned prior ... 'always good to be in the game as early as possible' 
in May 2018, Amber45 launched at $2,200 psf
https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/property-management-news/2018/5/171669/80-of-units-released-at-amber45-sold-at-average-of-2200-psf
 
A year later with ABSD increase, Amber Park sold at $2,425 psf, so we already talking a 10% up in sale psf.
 
For early buyers last year, savings of 10% + 5%, for FH avg 2mil unit = 300K or can say cheaper by 300K.
 
For those bigger units even more , easily 500K and up in cost savings/cheaper

to be fair to brother @car50, indeed squarefoot does show 4 profitable transactions vs 3 unprofitable transactions.  i must admit i am surprised some of the profitable units had lower purchase price than i thought.  now but i had another doubt.
 
i thought i had set the filter to include all transactions.  does it mean that from day 1 till now, there are only 4 profitable transactions vs 3 unprofitable ones?  if yes, then i would still think the echelon is far from a good buy reasoning being:
 
1) it has been good 2 year after plus after ssd expires and there are only 4 profitable transactions
2) there is inherent bias in such statistics gathered because most people would only sell when there is profit while those who sell despite a loss would be number lower because they are forced by circumstances to sell.
3) even if we disregard 2 points above, i would say 4 profitable vs 3 unprofitable transactions over time still means it is lower in terms of profitability.  for example, the much maligned alex residences already had 1 profitable (vs 0 unprofitable) despite a shorter window of about 2 years compared to echelon.

We are in a state of very highly distorted property market currently.
 
i.e. it is not a free market.
 
The transactions on the market do not fully or even well reflect the prices that all buyers and sellers are willing and able to transact at.
 
Give you an example...
 
Let's say buying a handphone sold at unregulated market prices. Buyers can choose and move between sellers until they find the correct match in terms of brand, price, warranty and condition of phone etc. Sellers set their respective prices and wait for buyers.
 
In current private property market, relatively few qualified buyers exist in terms of capability to buy (with sufficient savings, enbloc proceeds and supporting income) and in terms of willingness to buy (willing to pay all the taxes for example.
 
The sellers on the other hand have holding power (clearing TDSR or developers with huge pockets), and are generally not willing to sell (those who wanted to sell would not even have considered buying easily). The only group selling are those who are forced to (emigration, downgrading, upgrading, forced circumstances) or are holding "inferior" products (very old properties or some specific issues with their property - similar to cars with 3-4 owners)
 
The actual transactions in this very highly distorted market are very misleading to depend on as a guide for market condition.

i agree.  that's why there were 3 of us who thought that echelon is a poor buy (while there was 1 who thought echelon is a good buy) because of the considerations of the ssd and absd dragging down the likelihood of profitability for a pricey project.  and also in my pointers, i established that there will be, by laws of nature, more profitable than non-profitable transactions and the dearth of transactions, actually shows a lot more owners are stuck because their unit sale would have render them under water in current market.

	Developer SPH and Kajima Slashed Woodleigh Residences Price by 10%-13% from $2000psf to starting from $1733psf For Relaunch in May 2019. 


Interestingly today, my property agent messaged me that Singapore Press Holdings ("SPH") and its partner Kajima had slashed the price of Woodleigh Residences by 10% to 13% from S$2,000psf to as low as S$1,733psf. This was despite their initial assertion that the VVIP launch in October 2018 was a resounding success with over 60% of the launched units sold at an average price of 2,000psf. However, for the re-launch of Woodleigh Residences in May 2019, the developer SPH and Kajima must have decided that the risk of the market downturn may not be worth it and started slashing prices drastically in order to move more units. After all, the developer was only able to sell 30 units on the first weekend of its initial launch albeit declaring that 60% were sold by proclaiming that they only launched 50 units.  
 
For a 958sqft 3 bedder unit, prices would have dropped from S$1.92Mil to S$1.66Mil which translates to substantial savings of +S$256K for potential buyers relative to the first batch of VVIP. This does not seem fair to those first batch of buyers who had supported this integrated mixed commercial and residential project of SPH and Kajima during launch. I hope that SPH and Kajima would have given some goodwill renovation packages to compensate these initial buyers. 
 
On the property market front, I am not sure whether other developers will also take the lead in slashing prices but I hope so for the benefit of consumers. Once the music stops, property developers holding on to the most unsold inventories would need a very strong balance sheet to wait out the economic downturn. 
 
From the stock investing perspective, I have previously highlighted the lingering impairment risk of the Bidadari project, that is, Woodleigh Residences, due to the potential property market downturn and uncleared inventories.  I am glad that SPH has decided to slash the price in order to move their inventory of unsold units. Coupled with the bad news from the US/China trade war today, SPH price has dropped to S$2.40 per share and it may be worthwhile to re-look into their newly transformed property business from the previous media giant model. The new UK student accommodation segment acquisition should prove invaluable in the event of an economic downturn due to earnings resiliency

Interestingly today, my property agent messaged me that Singapore Press Holdings ("SPH") and its partner Kajima had slashed the price of Woodleigh Residences by 10% to 13% from S$2,000psf to as low as S$1,733psf. This was despite their initial assertion that the VVIP launch in October 2018 was a resounding success with over 60% of the launched units sold at an average price of 2,000psf. However, for the re-launch of Woodleigh Residences in May 2019, the developer SPH and Kajima must have decided that the risk of the market downturn may not be worth it and started slashing prices drastically in order to move more units. After all, the developer was only able to sell 30 units on the first weekend of its initial launch albeit declaring that 60% were sold by proclaiming that they only launched 50 units.   
For a 958sqft 3 bedder unit, prices would have dropped from S$1.92Mil to S$1.66Mil which translates to substantial savings of +S$256K for potential buyers relative to the first batch of VVIP. This does not seem fair to those first batch of buyers who had supported this integrated mixed commercial and residential project of SPH and Kajima during launch. I hope that SPH and Kajima would have given some goodwill renovation packages to compensate these initial buyers. 
 
On the property market front, I am not sure whether other developers will also take the lead in slashing prices but I hope so for the benefit of consumers. Once the music stops, property developers holding on to the most unsold inventories would need a very strong balance sheet to wait out the economic downturn. 
 
From the stock investing perspective, I have previously highlighted the lingering impairment risk of the Bidadari project, that is, Woodleigh Residences, due to the potential property market downturn and uncleared inventories.  I am glad that SPH has decided to slash the price in order to move their inventory of unsold units. Coupled with the bad news from the US/China trade war today, SPH price has dropped to S$2.40 per share and it may be worthwhile to re-look into their newly transformed property business from the previous media giant model. The new UK student accommodation segment acquisition should prove invaluable in the event of an economic downturn due to earnings resiliency

this is definitely good news for buyers!
 
to think the agents at Park Colonial kept harping that units at Woodleigh Residences would be sold at 2,000 psf
 
well, the developer can telegraph and publish their intention to launch at 2,000 psf, but if no one wants to buy, in the end, the developer would just have to reduce prices to move their units...
 
maybe this is a better buy than Tre Ver? just pay slightly more for a unit near MRT and amenities and a park too!

I think they were too greedy. Their land cost is 11xx psf right? Even 17xx they will make decent profit right? 
 
But at least they start a nice trend of slashing prices :)

It may or may not be fake news but... 
 
How many times have people been faked by “starting from...”?
 
Go and take a look first and book before posting in blogs and forums. The proof of the pudding is always in eating it.
 
There are a dozen ways to make it true but also not really true.

Why would one buy a LH in Bidadari, even though an integrated project, for even at $1733, when a relatively new FH in Dist 11 could be bought for $2000psf ?

Not all smooth sailing 
So this could be a sign for the many buildings along Balestier and other spots with mixed use buildings.. 
 

 
Some commercial buildings are facing an uphill task trying to achieve collective sales, with buyers deterred by high retail vacancy rates and prohibitive selling prices.
One of the more recent candidates for such a sale is Queensway Shopping Centre, a 45-year-old freehold site known for its sporting goods, but it has been far from smooth sailing.
An April 20 meeting to obtain consent for the move found that many owners were opposed to selling.
One is tailor Simon Chong, who is unimpressed by the $480,000 being offered for his 106 sq ft store.
He said in Mandarin: "It's a freehold space and we have our regular customers. Why would I want to sell it?"
The Straits Times understands that shop owners, who collectively account for more than 20 per cent of the property's share value, have joined forces to oppose the deal.
 
 
Rising numbers of commercial and mixed-use developments have hopped on the bandwagon since 2017, including landmarks such as People's Park Centre, Golden Mile Complex and Sim Lim Square.
However, such projects usually see a lower success rate than their residential counterparts.

5-Room HDB Flat In Bukit Merah Sold For Record $1.2m
 

A standard 5-room HDB flat was sold for $1.2 million in April this year – the first time that a standard HDB flat price surpassed the most expensive non-standard flats (DBSS units, terraces, maisonettes or flats at Pinnacle@Duxton) ever sold.
 
It smashed the previous records set by a 5-room DBSS unit at Boon Keng Road sold in January this year and a 237 sq m HDB Terrace at Jalan Bahagia in September 2018, both of which were sold at $1.185 million.

Yah, this is probably I will do next. I am a beginner to Commercial/Industrial property and normally I like to do some groundwork first. Avoiding investment on private properties for now due to the many CMs. 
 
Stock markets got burn, not so good at that. Luckily the corporate bonds are still performing though the yield is not that fantastic. Better than burning in the stock.

Stock mkt is hau siao one, not so easy to make a big fortune. But commercial properties in many locations are also getting saturated, so need to be selective. Get a few agents to talk to , you will learn more as  you talk to and  see more agents and locations. hope you will find a good piece of investment soon, of course not so easy. All the best.

Everyone is trying to invest, to make money, but where does the profit come from?
Money isn't generated from thin air, so someone has to sponsor that investor by losing money.. 
 
Sure you can talk up the market, but when it crashes, there will be losers. Some here will rejoice because they were astute enough and caught the market, but there will also be a fair number who had to 'sponsor' the winners..
 
So proceed with caution and never gamble.

Monday, 6 May 2019Developer SPH and Kajima Slashed Woodleigh Residences Price by 10%-13% from $2000psf to starting from $1733psf For Relaunch in May 2019. 


Interestingly today, my property agent messaged me that Singapore Press Holdings ("SPH") and its partner Kajima had slashed the price of Woodleigh Residences by 10% to 13% from S$2,000psf to as low as S$1,733psf. This was despite their initial assertion that the VVIP launch in October 2018 was a resounding success with over 60% of the launched units sold at an average price of 2,000psf. However, for the re-launch of Woodleigh Residences in May 2019, the developer SPH and Kajima must have decided that the risk of the market downturn may not be worth it and started slashing prices drastically in order to move more units. After all, the developer was only able to sell 30 units on the first weekend of its initial launch albeit declaring that 60% were sold by proclaiming that they only launched 50 units.  
 
For a 958sqft 3 bedder unit, prices would have dropped from S$1.92Mil to S$1.66Mil which translates to substantial savings of +S$256K for potential buyers relative to the first batch of VVIP. This does not seem fair to those first batch of buyers who had supported this integrated mixed commercial and residential project of SPH and Kajima during launch. I hope that SPH and Kajima would have given some goodwill renovation packages to compensate these initial buyers. 
 
On the property market front, I am not sure whether other developers will also take the lead in slashing prices but I hope so for the benefit of consumers. Once the music stops, property developers holding on to the most unsold inventories would need a very strong balance sheet to wait out the economic downturn. 
 
From the stock investing perspective, I have previously highlighted the lingering impairment risk of the Bidadari project, that is, Woodleigh Residences, due to the potential property market downturn and uncleared inventories.  I am glad that SPH has decided to slash the price in order to move their inventory of unsold units. Coupled with the bad news from the US/China trade war today, SPH price has dropped to S$2.40 per share and it may be worthwhile to re-look into their newly transformed property business from the previous media giant model. The new UK student accommodation segment acquisition should prove invaluable in the event of an economic downturn due to earnings resiliency

I would probably be watching from the grave to see how the government of that day deal with this issue when the old entire precinct expire at the same year.

Everyone is trying to invest, to make money, but where does the profit come from?
Money isn't generated from thin air, so someone has to sponsor that investor by losing money.. 
 
Sure you can talk up the market, but when it crashes, there will be losers. Some here will rejoice because they were astute enough and caught the market, but there will also be a fair number who had to 'sponsor' the winners..
 
So proceed with caution and never gamble.
It depends on who is holding the ball last when music stops. But the music has been going on for more than 10 years and looks unstoppable.

In short, they want to encourage young people to buy newer flat, and old people to buy older flats.
 
Older flats value will definitely be impacted cos lesser demand from the younger crowd.

The price is attractive for the 2 bedders.  For the 3 bedders, it still start from $2000psf
 
5k differential is between 3rd to 7th floor. 8th floor onwards differential about 10k per floor

https://www.99.co/blog/singapore/5-things-to-know-about-the-new-hdb-loan-and-cpf-rules/
5 Things to Know About the New CPF Rules When Buying Property
 

1. The property lease must cover the youngest buyer till the age of 95
 
2. You can now use your CPF to buy a property as long as there’s at least 20 years on the lease
 
3.The old “60 year limit” on HDB housing loans is gone
 
4.Your property lease needs to last till you’re 95, if you want to withdraw more than the Basic Retirement Sum
 
5. This is a big pivot, from focusing on remaining lease to focusing on sufficient lease
 
 
This could slightly push up the value of older properties, which started to see values plunge sharply once there was 30 years or less on the lease (now they have another 10 years of saleability).
 
The other effect is that it makes it harder for younger buyers to purchase older properties (because the age of the youngest buyer is used, to determine if the lease can last till 95). Conversely, it makes it easier for older buyers to purchase older properties; they face fewer loan restrictions simply due to the low remaining lease.

By lowering the minimum number of years (from 30 to 20 years) the property cannot take loan or use CPF, the nett result can only be increase in valuation.
 
More people qualify to use CPF and loan to buy your property = increased demand (although mostly older persons).

The cosy Holland Village in District 10 was designated a URA Identity Node in 2013, an honour bestowed upon local identity areas known for their distinctive qualities. Other nodes include Jalan Kayu and Balestier.
 
URA’s Draft Master Plan 2019 dedicates a section to Rejuvenating Familiar Places, with Holland Village among the designated areas. According to the URA website, there will be new residential, retail, and lifestyle developments to freshen up the village’s quirky and much-loved bohemian vibe.
 
In 2018, Far East Organization made the winning bid of $1.213 billion in a government tender for a 247,214 sqft land parcel in Holland Village. The eventual winning bid was the highest among five shortlisted ones, placing the psf per plot ratio (psf ppr) cost at $1,888, with a likely gross development value of $2,600 psf, or $1.7 billion to S1.8 billion.
 
 
En bloc gold rush
 
In March 2018, the Koh Brothers Group bought freehold 32-unit Toho Mansion, which has a plot ratio of 1.4,for $120.4 million. In the same month, the 48-unit Hollandia, which has a plot ratio of 1.6, was sold for $183.4 million ($1,703 psf ppr) to FEC Properties, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-listed Far East Consortium International.
 
In April, FEC acquired the 44-unit, 84,600 sqft The Estoril en-bloc at $224 million, translating into $1,654 psfppr. The Estoril and Hollandia are within a stone’s throw of each other, and their psf prices have been on an upward trend for the past 15 years. The Estoril’s prices catapulted from just above $500 psf in 2002 to break the $2,500 psf ceiling in 2018, and Hollandia’s quadrupled from $500 psfin 2002 to $2,000 psfin 2018. 
 
 
Toho Mansion will be redeveloped into Van Holland, with a unit distribution of two to five-bedroom apartments across approximately 110 units. Koh Brothers has not yet announced the TOP date or sale prices, but the sale price psf ppr of $1,806 does not include $200 psf marketing costs and $400 psf construction and design costs. All in, Van Holland’s launch prices are likely to be about $2,888 psf.
 
While the developers for The Estoril and Hollandia have not announced launch prices, indicative prices based on existing psf ppr and other costs put estimated sales prices in the same tier as Van Holland’s.
 
Other non-en bloc developments have also experienced price hikes on the back of the area’s overall popularity and government-supported rejuvenation. One of these is the 55-unit Quinterra at Holland Road, which has seen significant gains, running from $750 psf in 2017 to a steady $1,250 more recently. The rental transactions have also benefitted from Holland Village’s upcoming changes, clocking in at $4,800 per month in August 2016 for a 1,600 to 1,700 sqft unit, and $5,600 per month in February 2017 for a similarly sized unit.

To be honest, I reserved the bulk of my resources hoping to land a unit there when the Govt set it as a compulsory land sales in 2013. It would have been the rock bottom price if sold during that period. 
But for some reason (think they said heritage and planning of that land), the Govt withdrew it then. Maybe they just didn’t want to sell this cheaply.
 
Then it came back on the market several years later as a two envelope bidding system, with the land area increased to encompass the whole area. The bid that won this was 1888psf.
 
Not very hopeful I can land anything there now unless I can sell something or everything or strike some jackpot. Even then, it might still be a stretch with the high quantum. But will definitely go to the showroom!

As mentioned and not just HollandV ... check out URA development plans islandwide.kinda 'no brainer' to have an educated guess as to where property prices are heading  in expensive SG 
 

Just look at URA future plans for SG, too many to name ... think where property prices to be heading? Gonna be cheaper or more expensive in future? 
 
Its actually pretty obvious and clearcut, naysayers will just continue to nitpick. Wanna be the 28% ... or the 72% to keep chasing prices? 
'SG property, always ideal to stay vested'

If one to read more carefully into it ... it states (starting from S$1,733 per square foot) and not (average) of 1733 psf.
 
Developer can always just put in a few units and claim those are 'star buy' units ... low floor/bad facing or large/high quantum units etc.

As usual, people never learn.
 
I have been analyzing the weekly top losers (published by Edgeprop) for quite awhile now. I will dig into their numbers and draw reasons why they lose money. Many of these losing owners did hold their property for a long time, but they still lose money. Why?
 
The old saying that you just buy a SG property, keep it for 5-10 years and you sure make money is a complete nonsense  I am probably the only agent in Singapore to say that.

Without regulatory control (letting demand and supply settle on their own), who can lose money?
 
But with all those controls, we need to be able to sieve out who can make the most and/or lose the least.
 
But at the end, if it is just about a place to live in, surely it is at worst on par with paying rental?

I don't even have to find you many examples, just use the latest non-profit deals from Edgeproperty
 
See below for a loss after keeping for nearly 12 years.
 
The average holding period of all these 10 top losing owners is 8 years.
 
The key is not just buy any SG property and hope to make money. The key is to buy one of the right value.
 
Property is a long term investment, and like any long term investment (stocks, unit trust, etc), the key is to buy value.  Most people know that but when comes to property, they buy using emotions instead.

Have you seen the "size" of 5c coins 50 years ago?
 
Or even 1 coin?
 
In those times, $1 is a lot of money.
 
50 years later, guess the size of your $50 today.
 
It can be nobody lose money but everybody keep having more money even though there is more and more money in circulation.
 
But not to get too carried away, as this is Singapore.
 

if someone make money, someone else must lose money
money don't drop from sky or grow on trees

Bro...it is just part of their job. Please understand that the developer will not like it if they see a customer walking around with no salesperson attending to them.
 
In the end, the project ICs will get reprimanded during their daily meetings.
 
Even as an agent myself, I do not just walk into any showflat. I will make appointment with the project salespeople even if that project is marketed by my agency. And if it is not by my agency, I will look for a cobroke who is in the core team to bring me in. And trust me, that 99% of the time, I already knew the project way more than the salesperson, but I will still let him do his job.

Hahaha .This is just one of many tactics that developers use, offer some star buy units at lower psf to create buzz/attract interest/buy momentum. Only the noobs will kanna snook, thinking developer slashing prices.
 
And even at this 'CRAZY' price, can tell developer got no urgency to move units fast, probably holding for high sell psf.
“The sales gallery opened to an invite-only event on the evenings of Wednesday (8 May) and Thursday (9 May), an industry first, and saw many guests vying for their preferred units in the ballot held on Saturday (11 May) morning.”
As mentioned ... 'always good to be in the game as early as possible' ... or soon prices to be out of reach

The people who are still buying in this period, 2 mil is more like 200,000. Mostly enbloc millionaires or very high income earners.

What i meant was a showflat ain't exactly something very complex to understand that i need to be guided 
Dun need someone following me around just to point to things that even a half blind person can see for themselves i.e "sir, this is the bedroom, this is the toilet, this is the kitchen...." Duhhhhhh

That’s like a pseudo sale where the tag on a shirt indicates was $1000, now $500 and suddenly it sells like hot cakes.. even though the shirt may only be worth $100. 
But what surprises me the most is how willing we in Singapore are to pay such prices for that location. 
Astounding..

But when you see Amber Park asking for 2300 psf, it makes this look “cheap” and a good deal..
So if one believes the prices can only go northwards then it’s a bargain. 
If not.. caveat emptor
 
If you need anything big enough for kids, maid or parents, then a landed may be more cost effective actually

exactly my thoughts whilst reading @neost comment. i feel it is unfair to challenge the agent with such rhetoric.  best unit doesn't mean agent can buy because there are a host of limitations in the background like financing, absd, investment diversification etc

It's not a surprise; not really anybody's market now, but the inelasticity of the demand and supply at work.

If most agents can afford to buy private easily, then the market would be considered to be way overheated.
 
I don't think you are being fair to the agent.
 
My agaration from the agents I know personally, only about 10-20% live in private housing they bought themselves.

This is interesting because I just submitted a presentation deck about D11 to a foreign buyer few days ago.
 
He was looking at CCR  and I told him to look at D11. 
 
Now, as a value-add to MCF members, let me give some insight. Obviously, I am not going to show a presentation deck here, so I will keep this short.
 
Freehold avg $psf has diverge between D11 and D9&10.  To give some data, current avg $psf for freehold today is
 
D9 : $2415
D10: $2452
D11 : $1743
 
There is almost a 40% difference between D11 and D9&10.  Never before in the last decade that the gap has open so big, between D11 and the other 2 prime districts.  10 years ago, difference between D11 and D10 is around 10% and D11 and D9 around 20%.  At the current prices, D11 is very undervalued. As a prime district in CCR,   current psf prices in D11 have a huge margin of safety and should eventually catch up when Novena Healthcity is ready.

Parc Komo (Former Changi Garden) has been sold off for S$248.8 millions. The tenders had closed some time back for the same. The selling price of the Changi were expected to be S$196 million. The Chip Eng Seng Corporation has taken over the Changi and it has resulted in increase of the per square foot cost.

It is very rarely that you get a chance to own a residential or a commercial property in a prime location as the Changi. The residents of the 70s and 80s have had a lot of benefits since their properties are all free hold and located in closer to so the airports, business parks etc.
 
Parc Komo is surrounded with many public amenities and holds a very rich infrastructure. It has many employment opportunities as it is a hub for many commercial industries. This adds up to the benefits of the Parc Komo project.
 
Also if you are looking for an area that is commercially rich and full of opportunities for your business then Parc Komo is the place for you, as the expansion of the industrial business would eventually increase the market price of your property.

Parc Komo (Former Changi Garden) Condo 4

These are just a few of the benefits of the Parc Komo. If you want to enjoy life and watch your money grow at the same time, Parc Komo would be the right type of investment for you.
 
The area has been sold based upon a bid, which was much more than the expected selling price of the area, the project has potential and offers endless possibilities for the buyer to see their investment 
 
The Chip Eng Seng Corporations have won the bid of the Changi garden and now have the contract for developing the Parc Komo Condo and retail shops for the new buyers. CEL Real Estate Development is a trusted company that has been in business for the past many years. They develop residential and commercial properties. The company was incorporated in the year 2008 and is located in the Singapore.
 
They have been in a lot of limelight since their bidding for the Changi Garden. Some say that over priced bidding decision is a gamble and some say that it is a calculated move of the organisation as they know how much potential the place has and how their business would grow once the project would be finished. But being a organisation that has been in business for such a long time we believe that the CEL Real Estate Development has a bigger plan in store with the Parc Komo project for the buyers.
 
They believe in joint ventures and their current focus is to aim at high-end economically rich areas and construct residential, industrial and commercial properties. Just like their Parc Komo venture, which has been the talk of the town.
 
Parc Komo has come up as a treat for the buyers looking to purchase or invest in an elite locations. The CEL Real Estate Development have planned to build low-rise condos and retail shops for the buyers. Offering them once in a lifetime chance to own a property in a very nicely planned prime location.
 
There have been no indications as to what would be the Parc Komo Price of these low rise condominiums. But the Parc Komo project is set to be financed by within the group and also the company would borrow a loan amount from the bank to fund his project.
 
Whatever the cost of these Parc Komo projects would be we are sure people who have been planning to invest in an elite property wouldn’t miss this opportunity of owning their high end residential or commercial premises.
 
The company has also not yet shared any sort of Parc Komo Floor plan of the project as well. But potential buyers are very eager to know more about the details of the project as they have many expectation form this venture of CEL. They want to know how the setup of the room would be or what do the developers have in mind with this low-rise condominium in Parc Komo.
 
BENEFITS FOR THE RESIDENTIAL OWNERS
Whenever we look for a residential area to settle in, we need to keep in mind a lot of things before making any kind of a decision. If one has to move in with their family they just can’t move to any secluded place with very less or no amenities at all. One would want to move to a place where all the basic amenities like health care, schools, shopping complex, airport etc are easily accessible.
 
Parc Komo offers you all the above discussed facilities. A child’s education is very important and we understand a parent’s concern to provide the child with the best possible education form a very early age. Moving to a place that is far away from the child’s school could be very difficult too. But Parc Komo has many great schools in the nearby location.

All these schools focus on educational and personality development of the child.
 
Amongst the many factors that we consider before moving into a residential area, shopping centre are one of the main concerns of the people.

My old man once told off a sales person who wanted to sell him a guaranteed investment. Dad said he come up with the capital, if they earn money,  the profits are split. But if lose money, the sales guy swallows and pay up all the losses. Dad was willing to ink it at the lawyers. Then the sales guy STFU.

Parc Komo (Former Changi Garden) Condo 4

These are just a few of the benefits of the Parc Komo. If you want to enjoy life and watch your money grow at the same time, Parc Komo would be the right type of investment for you.
 
The area has been sold based upon a bid, which was much more than the expected selling price of the area, the project has potential and offers endless possibilities for the buyer to see their investment
 
The Chip Eng Seng Corporations have won the bid of the Changi garden and now have the contract for developing the Parc Komo Condo and retail shops for the new buyers. CEL Real Estate Development is a trusted company that has been in business for the past many years. They develop residential and commercial properties. The company was incorporated in the year 2008 and is located in the Singapore.
 
They have been in a lot of limelight since their bidding for the Changi Garden. Some say that over priced bidding decision is a gamble and some say that it is a calculated move of the organisation as they know how much potential the place has and how their business would grow once the project would be finished. But being a organisation that has been in business for such a long time we believe that the CEL Real Estate Development has a bigger plan in store with the Parc Komo project for the buyers.
 
They believe in joint ventures and their current focus is to aim at high-end economically rich areas and construct residential, industrial and commercial properties. Just like their Parc Komo venture, which has been the talk of the town.
 
Parc Komo has come up as a treat for the buyers looking to purchase or invest in an elite locations. The CEL Real Estate Development have planned to build low-rise condos and retail shops for the buyers. Offering them once in a lifetime chance to own a property in a very nicely planned prime location.
 
There have been no indications as to what would be the Parc Komo Price of these low rise condominiums. But the Parc Komo project is set to be financed by within the group and also the company would borrow a loan amount from the bank to fund his project.
 
Whatever the cost of these Parc Komo projects would be we are sure people who have been planning to invest in an elite property wouldn’t miss this opportunity of owning their high end residential or commercial premises.
 
The company has also not yet shared any sort of Parc Komo Floor plan of the project as well. But potential buyers are very eager to know more about the details of the project as they have many expectation form this venture of CEL. They want to know how the setup of the room would be or what do the developers have in mind with this low-rise condominium in Parc Komo.
 
BENEFITS FOR THE RESIDENTIAL OWNERS
Whenever we look for a residential area to settle in, we need to keep in mind a lot of things before making any kind of a decision. If one has to move in with their family they just can’t move to any secluded place with very less or no amenities at all. One would want to move to a place where all the basic amenities like health care, schools, shopping complex, airport etc are easily accessible.
 
Parc Komo offers you all the above discussed facilities. A child’s education is very important and we understand a parent’s concern to provide the child with the best possible education form a very early age. Moving to a place that is far away from the child’s school could be very difficult too. But Parc Komo has many great schools in the nearby location.

All these schools focus on educational and personality development of the child.
 
Amongst the many factors that we consider before moving into a residential area, shopping centre are one of the main concerns of the people.

This is interesting because I just submitted a presentation deck about D11 to a foreign buyer few days ago.
 
He was looking at CCR  and I told him to look at D11. 
 
Now, as a value-add to MCF members, let me give some insight. Obviously, I am not going to show a presentation deck here, so I will keep this short.
 
Freehold avg $psf has diverge between D11 and D9&10.  To give some data, current avg $psf for freehold today is
 
D9 : $2415
D10: $2452
D11 : $1743
 
There is almost a 40% difference between D11 and D9&10.  Never before in the last decade that the gap has open so big, between D11 and the other 2 prime districts.  10 years ago, difference between D11 and D10 is around 10% and D11 and D9 around 20%.  At the current prices, D11 is very undervalued. As a prime district in CCR,   current psf prices in D11 have a huge margin of safety and should eventually catch up when Novena Healthcity is ready.
D12, just a road across, lagi good value right?

The main trend I feel here is that people are buying for some personal usage related purposes. So for example for someone living in the North, it will make more sense for him to invest in the North (minimise cost and effort of travelling), or move into that North development and rent out their existing house.
 
Since very few people live in the city central to begin with (and maybe because even if they are living there, those properties are already very heavy costs, reducing spare cash for investment or increasing their tax burden for additional housing), the investing "demand" may be moderated.
 
I still feel it is a personal game. One can invest anywhere (SG) and come up clean and suave if the property is well utilised.
 
Just because a bungalow feels shiok to live in , or seems to be underpriced, does not make it the best buy for everyone. CCR properties also the same IMO.

Orchard used to be like that, or maybe is still like that. Authorities will say, take public transport there better!

Yah then worse still he bought one condo and go to market another, then the buyer ask him why he doesn’t buy at the next one.
 
Forever buying meh?

 
 
rather than chiding the agents for not buying a unit they promoting as bestest, i think a fairer approach to turn down agent is is to instead explain them that resources are limited but there are so many good products in this world, we can't be buying all the good products.
 
i have used this rhetoric to turn down telemarketers of insurance products before and it is effective and yet not antagonistic.

For Newton, not much land left for new developments or en-blocs, so lesser new supply going forward.

It baffles me when buyers are willing to pay huge premiums for integrated projects. Claustrophobic, huge crowds, congested roads around it,etc. And those who can afford the 3 bedroom and larger units would not be relying on public transport anyway, one of the key benefits of integrated developments.

this always happens.......brand new units always sell at premium to resale units.  even where passenger cars are concerned, this trend also holds.  developers and brand new cars dealers have a rigid cost structure to cover, hence their selling price is underscored by rising cost whereas for resale sellers, there are more likelihood of sellers willing to sell at loss or low profit.
 
sometimes i wonder why so many buyers willing to pay premium for brand new vs the choices in resale too.  and for parc komo, i also think the price appreciation potential is low. you can see the marketers for the condo trying to colour it as a project that is easy to find tenants citing proximity to cbp, airport and malls (even as far flung as NEX).  i do have my doubts actually....

my take is if one needs to market and promote it like hell..... then it is akin to selling ice to eskimos. i pass.

Because there is a belief that most of the money are made by the first owner. Also, some Chinese buyers  don't like resale because they are concern about "bad energies" from the previous owner.
 
In anycase, it is just human nature that they like new things. New handbags, new watches, new shoes, etc....even though the old ones are still working well.
 
There is nothing wrong liking new properties, but please buy the ones with the least premium over the district prices. If they buy one with high premium, it is not likely they will make money even in the next 10 years. Just ask those Reflection  owners who bought during launch a decade ago.

yes, the other day i wanted to chip in to your comment that not all properties sure profitable after holding 10 years but was tied up with work and didn't comment.  reflections at keppel bay and orchard scotts are the 2 projects i can think of as losing money even after holding 10 years.
 
anyhow, i do understand human psyche to prefer new things hehe.....i have some friends who believe that buying resale property, must checked if anyone has passed away or bankrupted living in it before and they must hack the toilets bowls and install a new one for such funny concerns.
 
but like you say, buyers should be discerning about the premium to pay for newness.  i have bought both brand new and resale properties before.....more key like you say is to identify the value  from the purchase.  i have often talked about the huge premiums many properties from far east seems to price in.  but yet i have also bought one from far east before

Thislooks promising
 
 
Parc Komo (Former Changi Garden) has been sold off for S$248.8 millions. The tenders had closed some time back for the same. The selling price of the Changi were expected to be S$196 million. The Chip Eng Seng Corporation has taken over the Changi and it has resulted in increase of the per square foot cost. The reason for bidding above the asking price was because the developers have faith that the prices will increase in the future and it would get them more profit.
 
 

 
Not sure if it is just me..but when I saw the name Parc Komo, I was thinking why not Park Komodo?
 
Then throw in some Komodo Dragons and some Raptors as the theme inside the condo......just like Flamingo Valley with a flamingo & park theme. They even have a waterfall inside there.  Or Savannah condo with a safari theme. 
 
Ok...I think I watch too much Jurrasic park....

Probably it is still a play on the quantum.
 
1700-1800 psf might sound a lot but for a 400sf unit it can still be manageable.
 
If used to rent out it might still be viable. Of course it’s better to compare with resale options if for rental or investment. For an investor, the main benefit is the validity of the warranty for new units and also perhaps the common areas. For some areas, the warranty may be 5, 10 or 15 years.
 
But the main issue is the rising cost that I have highlighted years ago.
 
For now, I will just shake legs and watch resale catch up with new sales pricing.

I am not familiar with that far eastern park of Singapore, but a quick look at OneMap and property guru reveals that it is opposite Changi prison and there are several units selling for 800 psf. And yes according to property guru, it is sitting a freehold plot. 
Since it is near Changi prison where executions etc are carried out, it may weigh on potential buyers mind when choosing to buy there .

Even if resale catch up with new sales, people who bought new sales will just break even...
 
And that is if it catch up. Might as well buy resale in the first place and get profit.

True. But there would be New new sales as well later. 
If not well maintained, after a certain age, rental would be affected.

Wait and see.
 
By lowering the minimum number of years (from 30 to 20 years) the property cannot take loan or use CPF, the nett result can only be increase in valuation.
 
More people qualify to use CPF and loan to buy your property = increased demand (although mostly older persons).

 
I do beg to differ..
 
Even if current affordability increases, I don't think most HDB buyers will want to buy all old flats at the max CPF and loan quantum they can afford.
 
They are still looking at good value purchases, and the baby boomer HDBs are dime a dozen, often in the condition requiring of more renovation works.
 
Unless its specific projects in Tanjong Pagar, Queenstown, Dakota etc, I don't think an old Jurong west flat will be worth more because of this measure..
 
Furthermore, by buying high, the reducing CPF and loan quantum will serve to lower valuation 5 years (MOP) down the road, which mean such flats are a sure way to loose money
 
Just my 2 cents...

they are just trying to discourage people to pay too much for HDB resale.
 
The question is, how much do you expect the next  buyer to pay after 10 years??

yes, the other day i wanted to chip in to your comment that not all properties sure profitable after holding 10 years but was tied up with work and didn't comment.  reflections at keppel bay and orchard scotts are the 2 projects i can think of as losing money even after holding 10 years.
 
anyhow, i do understand human psyche to prefer new things hehe.....i have some friends who believe that buying resale property, must checked if anyone has passed away or bankrupted living in it before and they must hack the toilets bowls and install a new one for such funny concerns.
 
but like you say, buyers should be discerning about the premium to pay for newness.  i have bought both brand new and resale properties before.....more key like you say is to identify the value  from the purchase.  i have often talked about the huge premiums many properties from far east seems to price in.  but yet i have also bought one from far east before
Seriously, u won't change toilet bowl? I've never met anyone who bought a place that  won't change toilet bowl before. Ha

That’s true generally. 
But you only need a few old buyers with no descendants and lots of CPF or cash to move that market segment. 
 
This group may actually be not as small as it appears to be.

Would you be referring to downgraders?
 
They could consider exiting their high maintenance private properties or downsize from larger flats in their twilight years, meaning they may have little ability to take bank loan
 
Either way, the likelihood for them to pay an above market price for suburb old properties may not be high.
 
Those who benefit from a large gain will be able to buy regardless of the CPF or loan cap

There is this type coming up in the near future that will fit in to this regulation very well. 60 year leaseholds (new). 
By then, it will be clear why the minimum period for CPF use and loans is reduced to 20 years.

That’s the odd thing ..
If you want a brand new place in a far more ulu site, you may have to pay almost 2000 psf
OR
Go into CCR and get a place 15 min from almost anywhere, FH and get some place which isn’t brand new for almost the same price or sometimes less..
I’ve actually never had the privilege of buying a brand new home and I don’t really miss it. 
Toilet bowls? If it bothers you, change la.. you can find decent ones for under $500 installed.

quite irrational.
Worst, its not even freehold or 999

 
lucky not name water parc .. must read out loud 

 
you mean "what the F**K"  

I am not familiar with that far eastern park of Singapore, but a quick look at OneMap and property guru reveals that it is opposite Changi prison and there are several units selling for 800 psf. And yes according to property guru, it is sitting a freehold plot.
 
Since it is near Changi prison where executions etc are carried out, it may weigh on potential buyers mind when choosing to buy there .
 
Currently saving up to buy a second property and who knows I may choose a unit there in the future

My wife refused to opt for landed when there was a good window between 2006 and 2010.
 
Several people I spoke to along the way also reflected two main issues: maintenance issues (roofing for example) and pests. Then there is also parking issue which is a big concern for me.
 
Go Malaysia of course security is the main concern.
 
But the most crucial concern is the yield. For someone not intending to sell for 20-30 years, yield is an important consideration.

We had a lengthy chat in another thread on landed and it’s pro and cons. 
Not for big rentals - in fact big condo units do worse than two small ones too. 
Landed may appreciate in value over time but their scarcity and also the joy if landed is a totally experience. 
And yes not everyone like them. 
But honestly maintenance isn’t that bad. With maintenance fees in condos going into thousands sometimes, you can spend less maintaining a house.

i agree with you.  example, my brother incurred roofing works on his landed before and it cost S$2k plus.....but actually for condo, most of us pays maintenance of 300 per month and 7 months of maintenance could cover that cost.
 
but for me, i still prefer condo because i am afraid of handling rats, snakes and other pests.....and also because i prefer to use condo facilities like swimming pool, gym and function room.

Pests is depends a lot on the unit u got. Not all units have pests. 
My in laws got snake... maybe once every five years? I stayed at my place for 10 years, only got lizard. Never seen rat, snakes, etc.
 
Maybe the minister staying nearby helps...

to be honest with you i also dislike having to handle lizards and cockroaches........so usually landed is at ground floor and small garden, more susceptible to these pests and the very idea of handling them, even though don't happen frequently, is not a savoury idea to me.

I dont think there is an inclination towards either
Although nowadays it seems a lot more prestigious to stay / own landed than condo
In the 80s into 90s, it was more prestigious to stay in condo

Old ppl always say "got ppl stay one, will have ants, lizards, roaches, spiders etc" cos ppl like to feed these, intentionally or not.
 
So, dun think too much for them cos they never have you or your dislike of them in their hearts

Just yada-ing. I see one pest i kill one. Its either i die or they die situation everytime. No time to weigh options, kill first then think how to dispose. I dun use hand. Newspapers or magazines my favourite weapon of pestruction.
 
Safe ride

If you are on higher ground, not near a hawker centre and forest, usually it’s just lizards, ants and some cockroaches. 
But if you don’t keep tidy and clean, you’ll find more of the latter..
 
As for roof and such, a good roof can last more than 50years. 
You don’t pay for parking or pool or such. 
With the money saved you can ask someone to do the landscaping, pay for the rubbish clearance fees and even a pool or koi pond maintenance fee.

Rats quite uncommon nowadays with improved rubbish collection and disposal. Unless u live near some f&b place. 
At least in my circle of friends, I find my friends who grew up in landed prefer to stay in landed or are actively searching and looking within the next few years... They don't mind living more suburban area. 
For those who grew up in hdb or condo, most of us stay in high rise. Those that can afford, prefer d9/10/11 condo. Esp those who grew up near town area haha

Agree! Grew up in landed when young aand will never wanna stay in landed anymore unless I am ultra rich with gardeners and domestic helpersss. 
Landed pros are mainly bragging rights. But to me, unless you stay at chatsworth, jervois, some bukit timah areas like Eng Kong, the rest is nothing to shout about (imho).
 
Landed cons - Real life experiences - roof gutters accumulate water also problem with NEA, govt water pipe leak under your house is also your problem, python once stayed comfortably in the house, huge monitor lizard visited, thieves claimed over gate and stole fruits in garden, robbers came into and robbed my mum.
 
So ya, I will also prefer a  nice condo with good estate management and facilities.

Will water storage facility behind Bedok Court add or remove value of a condo next to it? Since it is too small to call a park and can be noisy when water flows into it during rainy days. 
 
I can see usually the reservior is empty, what happens to the water once it's filled after a rain, will it cause odor like those in mangrove swamps during drying?

Agree! Grew up in landed when young aand will never wanna stay in landed anymore unless I am ultra rich with gardeners and domestic helpersss.
 
Landed pros are mainly bragging rights. But to me, unless you stay at chatsworth, jervois, some bukit timah areas like Eng Kong, the rest is nothing to shout about (imho).
 
Landed cons - Real life experiences - roof gutters accumulate water also problem with NEA, govt water pipe leak under your house is also your problem, python once stayed comfortably in the house, huge monitor lizard visited, thieves claimed over gate and stole fruits in garden, robbers came into and robbed my mum.
 
So ya, I will also prefer a nice condo with good estate management and facilities.

unfortunately, if u have more than 2 cars, u be hard press for the condo to allow u to park a 3rd car. Some even only have one unit one car policy.

Rats quite uncommon nowadays with improved rubbish collection and disposal. Unless u live near some f&b place.
 
At least in my circle of friends, I find my friends who grew up in landed prefer to stay in landed or are actively searching and looking within the next few years... They don't mind living more suburban area. 
For those who grew up in hdb or condo, most of us stay in high rise. Those that can afford, prefer d9/10/11 condo. Esp those who grew up near town area haha

Funny leh, i move from D9/10 Apartment to Landed in Suburban and never looked back.

A parking war can be detrimental to all.
I talked it out with my neighbour..
To be honest I thought he might be trouble but he actually sent me a Christmas card (and he wasn't a Christian), and sure, we aren't BFF, but he's actually nice. 
Could have made many complaints during my reno, but he did not.
 
I do have one neighbour who likes to park at the corner, like it was his lot, but there are plenty to go around. I guess it's worse when you have limited parking..

So there are others who find our condos dirt cheap, and our society a wonderful place to live in..

Lived in landed in JB when I was young. Snakes, monitor lizard, moles, centipedes, cockroaches, rats .. all visited the house at some point in time.
 
When I moved to Singapore, first time staying in HDB was miserable because of the feeling of being "trapped" and no garden/outdoor to go out and play catching, badminton, etc ..
 
However, over the years, I've grown to enjoy living in apt instead of landed. When we were house hunting, we consciously dropped landed from the list. 
 
Parking can sometimes be a hassle no matter one is living in landed, condo or hdb, depending on the type of neighbours one get.

Singapore residential market resilient due to strong foundations
 

DESPITE the cooling measures introduced on July 5, 2018, Singapore's residential property market has stayed resilient and quarterly primary home sales rose in the last three quarters, to the surprise of many.
 
In the first quarter of 2019, developers sold 1,838 new private homes, 16 per cent higher than the same period the previous year.
 
Non-landed residential prices outside the core central region have also held up in the last three quarters.
 
 
Singapore's housing policy has addressed both demand and supply. It has achieved one of the most successful outcomes in any global city. Singapore's median home price is estimated to be 4.6 years of income as at end-2018, lower than the 6.1 years in 2012.
 
The ratio for the median private residential unit is estimated to be 6.2 years as at end-2018, compared to 7.5 years in 2012, using the equivalent 85th percentile household income.
 
We see limited downside for the Singapore residential market as prices are affordable and the government is likely to manage prices to track income growth.
 
Over the last twenty years, both prices and household incomes enjoyed a steady compound annual growth rate of 3 to 4 per cent.
 
Upcoming supply is low, growing by less than 2 per cent annually in 2019-2020. The Singapore dollar has also been resilient, appreciating against the US dollar over the last 15 years.
 
While buyer stamp duties are relatively high, holding and selling costs are competitive for buyers who invest for the long term.

district 9 prime property in 2005 ($803 psf)
if i recall correctly, probably a suburban condo (e.g  Simsville?) in 2005 costs $400 psf
 
fast forward to 2019
 - woodleigh - Park Colonial condo costs $1,700 psf
-  what's comparable district 9 prime property new launch in 2018/2019? new futura?
New futura is another amazing (land bid) psf of yesteryear...Land bid $1,179 ppr ... sell $3,200 psf ... super huat
 
As mentioned ... 'SG property, always good to be in the game as early as possible'

18 New Futura units sold at $3,200 psf at launch
 

CDL said only 25 units were released during the private viewing on Jan 18.
 
The site was acquired by CDL in 2006 for $287.3 million in a collective sale, which worked out to be $1,179 per sq ft per plot ratio.

My feelings is that prices will be on the up due to the en bloc fever for the past 2 years. I understand most of them will be getting their compensation this year, hence with more money, developers will rise the price to sell to them at a high but cheaper than what they actually paid to them as most will use this opportunity to downgrade in size. Etc compensation 1.8m, they will buy houses at 1.2m. so overall they still made a gain but ended up paying at a high psf. With some of the them going to downgrade to a hdb, hdb prices will increase and since private cannot be cheaper than hdb, private will rise as well.

The en bloc buyers really shake up the market.
They are so flushed with cash, but there aren't too many large sized apartments around, so they can really bid high for their desired units. Then the other condo sellers will benefit as the psf goes sky high...

Case Study: A curious case of “no money down” property schemes
 

We present the case of John and his parents. John is an undergraduate student who has taken finance and investment classes that cover a range of asset-types, including real estate. During a family dinner, when discussing a module that John was taking in the university, Real Estate Investments and Finance, his parents divulged that they have made a real estate investment several years ago: a 3-bedroom freehold condominium unit in Johor, Malaysia.
 
Their decision to commit was based on 3 key factors:
 
1. They believe that real estate is a safe asset that will constantly grow in value. If held for long enough, the capital gains will return a hefty sum. Surely, real estate is a worthwhile investment with little downside risk.
 
2. They trusted their friend’s ‘hot tip’ and dived head first without weighing all the costs and benefits that the investment might bring. They assumed that if it were a good investment for their close friend, it was good for them too.
 
3. Best of all, they loved the NO MONEY DOWN proposition! The property sold by the developer came with 100% financing from a bank in Malaysia! Other than RM$5,000 administration fee and legal costs, they did not have to pay down the mortgage until the property is completed and rentals start rolling in.
 
They thought: why not own another property in addition to the one in Singapore? Things could not get any better than this. The property has a freehold title and is located in a middle-high end residential neighbourhood with a mall complete with all the necessary amenities: schools, nurseries, clinics, etc. and half an hour’s drive to Singapore.
 
Four years later, around mid-2018, the property was completed. The 15-year mortgage kicked-in on the RM$618,800 principal at 4.5% p.a. interest. They were repaying RM$5,000 a month to the bank.
 
During the 10 months, there were no calls looking to rent the apartment.
 
So it has been purely cash outflow, with maintenance expenses, property tax, utilities bills and of course the hefty mortgage.
 
This NO MONEY DOWN deal in Johor made matters worse for the family’s finances.
 
John’s parents have taken on 3 corporate loans for their family business. Liabilities due in the next 2 years amount to about S$380,000, i.e. regular payments of about S$16,000 each month. Amidst the slow business environment for engineering contractors in Singapore, their monthly cash flow for the business and family struggled to stay positive.
 
So how did their ‘brilliant’ investment opportunity fare to date? The initial price of the 3-bedroom apartment of 1,097 sqft was RM$618,800. A quick online survey of various property websites resulted in a few dozen listings which indicated an asking price range of RM$308,000-700,000. Half of the listings for similar-sized 3-bedroom units were below RM$440,000, with the lowest being RM$308,000 which was amongst a handful that were listed under “foreclosure sales”. There was a single listing at RM$700,000, a clear outlier as the next highest listing we could find was at RM$598,000.
 
Taking the top outlier out of the picture, the average market price of the two dozen listings was around RM$430,000. For John’s parents, assuming that they are able to divest the apartment at RM$430,000, they will suffer a capital loss of RM$188,800, or about 30%, over the past 5 years, excluding other costs.
 
This is a massive loss for a family who has barely enough money to tide through daily living expenses.
 
This capital loss will be further exacerbated by the fact that they have signed up a 100% Loan-to-Value (LTV) mortgage for the RM$618,800 investment. This loan has a fixed interest rate of 4.5% per annum. Over the 15-year loan tenure, the interest will cost about RM$230,000. Adding that to the principal sum, John’s parents would need to foot a massive RM$850,000 over the 15-year period.
 
Alternatively, John’s parents could decide to sell the property at the average market price today, they would still need to foot a loss of RM$188,800 plus interest expenses and legal costs. Since “no money” was put up at the start, even a slight decrease in value from the original amount of the property would give us a negative return on investment. What a way to beat the market.
 
Assuming that today’s market is indeed at RM$430,000, should John wait for the market to pick up, he would have to wait for Malaysia’s real estate market to rebound by 10% a year continuously for the next 5 years before he can breakeven on the investment. However, there do not seem to be many interested buyers at this price, which is why foreclosure sales are priced from a mere RM$308,000. If John had to divest at RM$308,000, the capital loss will be RM$310,800 before fees and expenses.
 
So, what went wrong? A deeper reflection on the entire picture will show us just how many and how deep the caveats are in such an ‘investment strategy’, as well as the lessons John learnt from this case.


1. If it’s too good to be true, then it probably is.
 
We hope that the age-old saying is not true. We always hope for a better life for our family. That hope makes us feel as if we have to outperform the market to get ‘out of the rat race’ and head towards ‘financial freedom’. But get-rich-quick schemes are never the solution. These are schemes that tap on our insecurities in the hope that we ignore all the ‘what-ifs’ that could get us into more financial troubles. ‘No money down’ property schemes are highly risky investments with too many what-ifs for investors. Even for highly experienced real estate investors such as REITs managers, the rules limit their gearing ratio a maximum of 45%.
 
2. Pick up a book (or go to your best friend, Google)
 
A major reason why many fall prey to such schemes or scams is due to the lack of research about the asset class they are investing in. Basing your research on a ‘gut feeling’ which many claim as their ‘keen acumen’, or a ‘hot tip’ from a friend or relative is obviously insufficient. Any investment of any kind requires good solid research to back up, both quantitative and qualitative. If you’re not sure, pay a trustworthy expert to do the due diligence for you. Read a book related to the asset class or simply google it! And do make sure that you check on the reliability of the sources too.
 
3. If at first you don’t succeed… err… try something else
 
It does not always have to be real estate. Good investments can be found in many areas around us. Invest in something you understand. If you can’t understand the asset class well enough, chances are it’s not a well-suited investment for you. Real estate as an asset class requires more than just betting that the market will go up or down in your favour. There is one revenue line and many lines of cost components involved in generating the overall returns that have to be considered. If that sounds too foreign for you, try investing in an asset class that’s a lot more understandable.
 
It would be foolish for one to think that he knows how to invest in real estate simply because he has lived in real estate his whole life.

Tengah 1st batch of flats was launched in November 2018 BTO programme . 
The residents of this first batch will have to put up with construction noise and debris for Tengah subsequent batch of flats in teh future not to mention the lack of basic amenities such as eating places and markets etc as there is still no critical mass of residents in Tengah yet .
 
Also when you want sell your Tengah flat after the MOP period , may have to put up with lower prices as young couples need not buy from existing owners and can apply direct to HDB.

They should save up for an EC if they want to go the new HDB route.
 
The 5-10 years old new HDB flats have not been appreciating since 2013. From 2013 till now, those 5-10 years old HDBs had a depreciating trend of -3.3%.  Sure, there are some that make money, but my data is the average for all the districts.
 
People need to relook into BTOs in a different light.

Singapore cannot continue to build at the same rate it has been doing for the last decade. At the very least, it cannot sustain the same rate.  
Private land sales already dropped to less than a couple thousand, HDB maybe another couple of years also have to slow down the building rate. There is simply not enough land and not enough resources (sand, water etc).

I think most pests not so fussy about staying landed, condo or hdb or whether got seaview or skyview.
 
Old ppl always say "got ppl stay one, will have ants, lizards, roaches, spiders etc" cos ppl like to feed these, intentionally or not.
 
So, dun think too much for them cos they never have you or your dislike of them in their hearts

If you were a foreigner investing in Singapore properties, couldn't you say something similar about sudden ABSD implementation?
bro, been a quiet reader here.
 
allow me to share my 2 cents , Malaysia  has plenty of land with dubious builders and very lax rules/laws to bring to task on companies that are fly by nite type and especially if you are a foreigner in malaysia 
 
Singapore has a very structured system where it almost difficult to con your way thru plus.....limited land size.
 
 
it's very much like buying watches, I would love to owned a corum watch but I know the value drop so fast and steep till you need to beg people to buy it off you, should you decided to sell off 
 
 
 

Cheap Malaysian Property Riddled With Risks, as Singapore Investors Find Out 
Bianca Mascarenhas|CNBC Asia-Pacific 
Published 11:09 PM ET Mon, 16 July 2012CNBC.com


    

    

    

    

    

    


Singaporean Deepak Gurnani has spent the past couple of years trying to recover an investment gone wrong in Malaysia. The 51-year-old businessman spent $66,000 on a property in the popular beach destination Port Dickson, Malaysia in 1993. It functioned as a fuss-free home away from home until two years ago, when the developer defaulted on the payment of the property’s maintenance fees.

“This resulted in Coco Bay Condominium’s Management chasing us for recovery,” says Gurnani, who now pays RM400 ($126) every quarter as maintenance and another RM150 for water, quit rent and property tax every quarter. All expenses considered, Gurnani has lost an estimated $150,000 and is expected to salvage only $30,000 of the holding cost, if he is lucky.
Gurnani is one of a rising number of Singaporeans who have been burnt investing in real estate in Malaysia. In a recently reported case, 129 disgruntled investors, which included some Singaporeans, of Nexus Residence – a luxury development in Sabah – took local developer Karambunai Corp into arbitration for not paying almost one year in arrears on its “lease back” rental payments due to them.
 
Faced with skyrocketing property prices in Singapore, property investors have turned to Malaysia’s real estate for opportunities in recent years.
Singapore’s property prices have surged to an all-time high in 2011, according to the Private Property Index compiled by Urban Redevelopment Authority, the local body that governs land planning. The average price of a luxury property in Singapore was valued around US$2,518 per sq. foot, according to the 2011 Wealth Report , published by property consultant Knightfrank. This makes properties in Malaysia approximately five to six times cheaper in comparison.
The rising value of the Singapore dollar, which currently exchanges for about 2.5 Malaysian ringgits, also means that Singaporeans get more bang for their buck. The Singapore dollar has risen almost three percent against Malaysia’s currency since the start of the year.
“There has been an increase in Singaporeans investing in Malaysian property over the past 5 years due to high property prices in Singapore and the favorable exchange rate,” says Khalil Adis, Singapore Editor for Property Report.
According to the Southeast Asia property website www.property-report.com, China, Singapore, Japan and South Korea are said to be the biggest foreign investors in the Malaysian property market, with Singaporeans the biggest buyers in the state of Nusajaya, Johor, just across the border.
Government incentives also help explain a trend in the rising number of Singaporeans buying Malaysian property. According to Eric Chan, Deputy Managing Director of property developer Eastern & Oriental Berhad, the government’s “Malaysia My Second Home (MM2H) program” that grants foreigners easy entry via a renewable Social Visit Pass, with a multiple-entry visa that is valid for 10 years, has made Malaysian property attractive to Singapore investors.
“Added to this mix is Malaysia’s friendly lending terms, which are also extended to foreigners and if conditions are met, margins of financing can be as high as 90 percent,” Chan said.
Despite the incentives, risks remain for those property investors who do not carry out enough research before investing in Malaysian property, analysts say.
They add that a lack of transparency in the Malaysian real estate market is one of the key risks faced by foreign investors. According to the 2012 Global Real Estate Transparency Index, a proprietary Jones Lang LaSalle survey, Malaysia ranks 23rd on the index, ten spots lower than Singapore.
The index ranks countries in terms of the ease of comparison of occupancy costs, the ability to provide more options for strategic action (such as the execution of sale and leasebacks) and the efficiency of transactions.
News that the Malaysia government is contemplating raising the minimum property purchase price for foreign investors from RM500, 000 to RM1 million, in the lead up to elections next year, could also be a risk factor, analysts say. The move may win over voters, especially by young middle-class Malaysians who have been burdened by fast rising home prices, but could reduce the lure of Malaysia as a venue for affordable property market.
Location, Reputation Are Key
What seems to determine successful investment in Malaysian property as such largely revolves around the location and the credibility of the developer, experts say.
“A reputable developer and good location is the mantra in property investment and it is no different in Malaysia. Research therefore, is imperative in buying a property,” Chan, said.
For projects where these criteria are met, it is not uncommon for purchasers to enjoy capital appreciation of close to 30 percent upon completion, he added.
Kuala Lumpur (KL), Penang and Iskandar, which is part of the southern state of Johor, rank among the top hot locations for investment in Malaysia for foreign investors.
Locations like Malacca, on the other hand, are likely to see very low returns on their investment. David Neubronner, Head of Residential Project Sales, of Jones Lang LaSalle told CNBC that “KL being the capital city and key business center would have a much wider appeal, more potential and possibly better returns on investments in the medium to long term.”
On the other hand, Malacca is a historical town and appeals more to locals. “The type of options and opportunities are also more restrictive and I suspect much of the buying interest is hinged more on sentiments than investment,” said Neubronner.
Local investors looking to invest in Malaysian property need to tread more carefully, says Gurnani.
He says that living in Singapore tends to give investors a false sense of security and makes them more prone to invest without thinking about the particular risks involved in overseas property markets.
“Malaysia is one place where I will never put money again,” he said

Will be interesting to see how the price of flats pan out.. 
The top end, near MRT, and CCR flats will still  sell well and I won't be surprised to see more million dollar sales, but the average flat will be nicely within the reach of the average Joe..

Some of the balance left over 4rm flats from Jalan Satu (Geylang) are going at $30k+ more vs original launch price. 
I know cos I happen to have the original launch prices and compared vs the latest prices. I suppose it was 2 years ago hence inflation and time value jacked the prices up but its still about a 6% increase which is steep by anyone's standards, let alone HDB BTO!

HDB BTO pegged to market rate, so no surprises here. Even with the 6% increase still much cheaper than resale within same vicinity and you get brand new!  
As mentioned ... 'SG property, always good to be in as early as possible'

That’s true! Heard from another MCF bro that the Telok Blangah 4rm flats going for $250k+ more than original price but this partly cos keys ready n there’s been a lapse of 3-4yrs at least but even then it’s astonishing n goes to confirm that young couples shld always apply BTO for first flat esp if their incomes are within the limit. Can always buy condo later if that is the aspiration even though condo may also have gone up but % wise BTO upside shld be greater?

More so now with current 12% ABSD, can wait it out see if any changes few years later after MOP. 
My school of thought here is that HDB should always be treated as for own stay, with PTE as investment. So no right no wrong, either BTO first then PTE or alternatively, can go for EC and then PTE all the way.

Please go for ECs if one chooses the HDB path. 
 
Just look at the chart below for All HDBs (aged 5-10) vs All ECs (aged 5-10). They are all  based on TOP between 2009-2014
 
The BTOs appreciation are not faring that well after their MOP since 2013
 
This data is an average for all unit types and all districts

that's only true till someone decide that let you earn might as well i earn and raises certain ceiling again.
 
At this point in time, they still have not think thru on carpark as a source of revenue unlike HK and JP.
 
Even Germany and UK has started long way back.

Government can’t adopt ‘hands-off’ approach to managing property market: Lawrence Wong
 

"Our aim is not to bring prices down, but to steady the cycle and to stabilise the market. [We want] to have a steady and sustained property market, moving broadly in line with income growth,” he reiterates. “This is a shift from the past where we tended to take a more laissez-faire approach [to the property market].”
 
The property market has shown that left to itself, it tends to go through large price swings. This harms genuine homebuyers and if corrective actions are not taken to prevent a bubble forming, the costs would eventually be larger and more painful for everyone, the minister says.
 
"Investors have to consider what it means to buy property and the implications for property values,” says Wong. He warns that people’s fear of missing out may lead them to be caught up in the price cycle.
 
The interplay between markets and state intervention is always at work in the real estate industry, especially in ensuring the affordability of housing. “We cannot just continue with the status quo and assume that property prices will always appreciate, regardless of fundamentals,”

Please go for ECs if one chooses the HDB path. 
 
Just look at the chart below for All HDBs (aged 5-10) vs All ECs (aged 5-10). They are all  based on TOP between 2009-2014
 
The BTOs appreciation are not faring that well after their MOP since 2013
 
This data is an average for all unit types and all districts
 
As mentioned earlier, HDB for own stay PTE investment so different ballgame altogether.If looking purely based on capital apprecation, many factors to consider.
 
Example- 
BTO in a good matured estate 500-700k, 50% upside to sell 750k-1mil potentially achievable future.
EC current near 1k psf, can sell 1.5k psf future for around same upside?
 
Then there's the cost factor-
BTO- lower cost, less bank loan equal less interest pay up full faster against ... EC- higher cost, more debt etc.
 
Both got pro and con, diff strokes diff folks. But generally, for a young couple just starting out, I would say BTO still the way to go, can look into PTE as investment in future.

The thing is, I am not too sure about the above going forward for BTOs
 
I actually have a resale chart for D3 (very mature HDB district), but I thought no point getting too technical in a forum. 
 
Ultimately,  I think if one is buying BTOs for reasons like less financing commitment, near parents, new flat, etc..that's certainly ok. But best not to bet on the capital appreciation part by assuming one can get the same capital gain as the BTOs of the past decade. The resale avg $psf data since 2013 has been on a decline,  where as the capital gain between 2002-2013 has been on a steep increase. They are in a different market cycle and buyers of new BTOs have to understand that.

Other than those who hope they had gotten a better location or a better spec unit, who has really regretted a property purchase in the last 10 years? Very few and far in between if I may say so.

For private property, I don't think capital appreciation is an issue provided they buy at the right value regardless whether they buy now or 10 years ago.
 
My concern is only with new BTOs or resale HDBs that were bought after 2013.
 
 I was looking through D3 (very mature HDB estate) for all HDBs that are going to MOP within the next one month. Which means that these owners bought in May/June 2014.  60 units turned up in my data. Out of these 60 units, 38 units are estimated to be in the red. With the HDB resale $psf trend on a decline now, I am not sure if these 38 units will ever see profitability even in another 5 years.
 
However, I could not tell how many are resale and how many are BTOs in that 60 units which turn up in my data. I think most should be resale.
 
The point is if D3 is already facing this for HDB units after 2013, what more about other district?

BTW, just for curiosity, I ran my data for Punggol  HDB units that are going to MOP within the next one month.
 
27 units turned up, 25 units are estimated to be in the red.
 
I believe these should be mostly BTOs considering it is Punggol.

not only that. Nowadays, with the working landscape so different like CECA and disruption, less risky to buy BTO.

Whether a BTO can double its price is highly dependent on its location..
I think that’s obvious but let’s put it out there just so no one has any illusions..
A flat in marsiling 15-20 min from a MRT is quite different from a Dawson one for example..
That applies to ECs too.

The climate has indeed changed.
 
Previously, I always tell my younger friends, don't waste your citizen rights by buying your first property a Hdb flat. Stay 5 yrs, sell and apply for another new hdb. Stay another 5 yrs and sell to buy an EC if you still qualify. Stay 5 yrs and sell and move on to private. This is the safest and easiest way to make monies from property without too much stress. 
 
Now, that method won't work anymore. However, the fundamentals remain the same... Start with a hdb...

This is a more mercenary approach. Cannot attached emotion to the property. Fact of life is do one view the property as a house or a home?
 
Monetary gains vs non-monetary loss. Need to be very clinical in one's overall value system and only certain type/profile people can execute this well.

Agree, it would be unwise to simply assume high gains of the past decade to be mirrored going forward.  
Not just the current high psf, the property environment overall had also changed, one being CMs like SSD and ABSD.
 
That said, here is still expensive SG and property prices to continue UPtrend, though at a more regulated pace.
 
Have to adopt an even longer term view with keyword ... holding power

They learned from the GE 2011 lesson where one of the biggest unhappiness is the escalating HDB resale and private property prices beyond the reach of most people
 
So now you have HDB resale  prices that are declining and private property prices which increase on a controlled pace.
 
Everyone should be happy now.

There is a good chance for pte property prices to correct in the 2nd half of this year and next year.
 
1. Oversupply due to too many enblocs in 2017 to 2018.
2. Weak demand due to trade war, ageing population and declining HDB resale prices.

used to be buy 5 room, then sell and down grade to 4 room and sell one last time to reap maximum profit. That was like 25 to 30 years ago strategy.
 
Now with all the speculative curb in place no more lobang.

Just like an invisible hand which can push prices down or make it go up, does one think the government will allow it to crash when it has a certain magic threshold to maintain? Did they make these statements on coe?
 
Look at the mild relaxation of the rules some time back when prices came down more than their projections, did prices climb back up gradually? There's more pent up demand from overseas than from this tiny dot I feel.

The influence of agents cannot be underestimated.
 
Somehow, they are able to bring down the crowd. I see it all the time how agents network and market to bring in the buyers.
 
Of course, the media will only take photos when the showflat is packed so a bit of exaggeration is always there.
 
Let me add a fact that a lot of people doesn't know. Usually during preview stage (especially big projects)  where the agents bring in the crowd and collect cheques, the agents don't usually know the commission they would get. They just do their job based on their knowledge, conviction and suitability of the project to their buyers. There is usually no commission information at the preview stage  to cause biases towards one project or another.

CEO of propnex already said 70 units(which is 25%) sold was very credible, that means the expectation  was much lower, what else to say. Last time initial launch no 25% left no talk. Haha.

quick question
during lunch colleague ask if a hdb resale was sold or transacted at $1M
does that mean the valuation is $1M
or likely valuation is $700k-$800k
and paid $200k-$300 COV? 
next can only sell $800k?

There is no way to know unless we know which unit is this.
 
All I know is that not many buyers are willing to pay COV thesedays.  Infact, they are more likely to forfeit their option fee if the valuation comes out to have high COV/

The price show on hdb transacted website included any cov buyer has paid. So nobody would know the valuation price except the buyer themselves. Even owner also dont know if there is any cov that the buyer would paid. 
Many times depends on how high the cov is and also how rich the buyer is. If the buyer is rich, like the house a lot and cov not say super high, some buyer will still pay de.

$1m HDB resale transactions - can your HDB flat fetch $1 million too?
 

Here's a look at the most expensive HDB resale transactions in the past 12 months.
 
In the past 12 months alone, there have been a whopping 82 resale transactions at $1m and above!
 
Not all of them are "premium" flats like DBSS and maisonettes either - we're starting to see more and more regular 5-room flats, and even some 4-room flats, going for this price. It's a crazy world.

this means the hdb valuation is $1M-$1.1M? Somebody once told me HDB has no valuation. 
Agree on the price then valuation, which means flexible valuation? The valuation is tied to the value of the buyer (age and income)? 
 
Now with minimum 30 years no CPF and no loan reduced to 20 years, it means the valuation can only go higher as a whole?
 
No idea really.

There is a valuation.
 
It is just that both parties agreed price first then buyer seek for valuation report (needed for CPF or loan purchases)
 
The HDB valuation report will normally based on recent transacted market value. 
 
If the agreed price is too far away from the market value, the valuer may come to the house to check.
 
Normally agents of both side already had a good idea of what the valuation is and will advise their clients accordingly before they transact.

Use to be that way before 2014
 
So those days, it is the seller who seeks valuation report first  before transaction and then they will ask for cash above that valuation (COV).

hdb market has been having valuation report first before transacting until the market overheated with all the greedy home owners insisting on positive cov regardless of how well in demand is the unit in question.
 
govt saw the need to take out this element because it is skewed towards ever increasing transacted prices for hdb.  
 
and as well, it has worked in private property market, why it shouldn't work in the hdb market.

Only a few things matter
- good toilets
- increased floor size
- maybe a pool
- new roof
- marble floor also maybe
 
But keep things simple ..

How Well Do Shoebox Investments Perform? (A 10-year Update)

 
A mistake in how they chart.
 
When checking for appreciation trend, the y-axis should be in terms of average $psf. Not average price!
 
Average price can be influence by size.  The appreciation shown by the shoeboxes may not be because of just increase in value, but probably because of increase in size. 
 
So using Avg $psf is a better metric to measure the true increase in value.
 
They need to be more meticulous when coming out with such charts.

Just look around across every town. Almost every nook and cranny is built. Not more than 1 or 2 sites per town is not built yet. And still need to reserve to build around 10,000 HDBs (or more) per year.
 
Major plot that still can take from greenery is Bidadari. Pasir Panjang and Paya Lebar won’t really be available for 10 plus years.

Agree  
At current, ABSD pushing buyers to go for smaller units, and the recent new min size guideline requirement means less shoebox supply forward.
 
In future, we are looking at even higher and rising property prices to affordability, land supply depletion, ageing population to more FTs etc ... to continue sustain demand for such units.

https://www.straitstimes.com/business/property/property-price-curbs-have-achieved-stabilization-goals-lawrence-wong
Property price curbs have achieved stabilisation goals: Lawrence Wong
 

"The property market last year, before the cooling measures were put in place, we saw prices rising very sharply," Mr Wong said in an interview with Bloomberg Television's Haslinda Amin in Singapore.
 
"There was a very real risk that prices would outpace fundamentals, and I think if that had happened then eventually it would lead to a destabilising correction, and I think everybody would be worse off."
 
 
"It was, as we had stressed then, not to bring down prices but to stabilise and moderate the cycle, and I think we have achieved that effect," Mr Wong said.
 
Asked if he was concerned about property buyers moving focus from Hong Kong's ever-rising property market to cheaper Singapore, Mr Wong said there will always be foreign investors looking to buy in Singapore because they think it is a good investment.
 
However, he said Singapore will continue to monitor prices and has a suite of available tools at its disposal to ensure stability.
 
"We welcome investors to our property market, but what we want to ensure is that demand, regardless whether it's local demand or foreign demand, doesn't cause the prices to move at a pace that outstrips fundamentals."

The chief issue is the huge surplus and savings of SG.
 
We will have to guess the possible actions forward to reduce savings and surplus? Based on my interpretations, it should not be pretty for those holding mainly cash.

Resale unit at Richmond Park reaps $1.85 mil profit
 

At Richmond Park, on Bideford Road in prime District 9, the seller of a 1,550 sq ft unit made the top gain of $1.85 million over the week of May 14 to 21. The three-bedroom unit on the 16th floor was purchased for $2.53 million ($1,632 psf) in December 1999 and sold for $4.39 million ($2,830 psf) on May 16.The seller made a 73% profit.
 
Meanwhile, the second-highest gain – a profit of $1.125 million, or 115% – made during the week was at Nineteen Shelford Road in prime District 11.
The 1,561 sq ft, two-bedroom unit, purchased for $975,000 ($625 psf) in April 2002, was sold for $2.1 million ($1,345 psf) on May 15.
 
On the other hand, the greatest loss incurred over the week was from the resale of a 1,711 sq ft, three-bedroom unit at the 99-year leasehold Reflections at Keppel Bay in District 4. Purchased in April 2007 for $3.998 million ($2,336 psf), the property was sold on May 17 for $3.13 million ($1,829 psf). The seller sustained a 22% loss of $868,700.

Can Private Home Prices Really Average $2,900 psf in 2030?
 
(A recent DBS report is raising a bit of ruckus, with claims that new home prices can average $2,900 psf by 2030)
 

Where at private home prices at now?
 
The average private home price is roughly $1,570 psf. This is up from an average of about $655psf, 10 years ago; an increase of roughly 140 per cent.
 
If we were to go strictly by these numbers, an average of $2,900 doesn’t seem that far fetched. It’s about the same length of time, and the prediction ($1,570 to $2,900 psf) is an increase of only about 84.7 per cent; even if it were to happen, that’s a far more modest increase than we’ve seen before in the past.
 
But as we well know, things are never quite that simple; especially if we’re going to make speculations about the property scene 11 years from now. And if there’s one thing we tend to distrust, it’s analysts putting on their Dungeons & Dragons LARP outfits and pretending to be wizards.
 
 
Is it possible? Yes. But is it implausible?
 
Given how things look right now, we’d also say yes.
 
The simple biggest factor at play – the same one as its always been – is government policy. For so long as the government doesn’t want property prices to overheat, big surges like we saw in the old days aren’t going to happen.
 
This doesn’t mean you can’t find the occasional property that may appreciate this well – but such properties are going to be harder to find. They’re likely to be scarce, excellent buys that you need a lot of luck and acumen to pick. Barring big shifts in government policy, similar leaps are not likely to happen for the bulk of the market.

such a perfect deal why agent cannot market it?
why go auction? can fetch even higher price compare to agent sale?

 
Actually the agent is marketing it. But through this new platform from Propnex called HDB Auction.
 
IMO, it is pointless to use an auction platform for marketing HDB resale. Even if the auction could drive a very high price for the seller, the buyer, upon finding out a very high COV for the purchase (after the auction and need to get valuation), can just forfeit his $1000 option fee and walk away. 
 
Auction uses hype, urgency and emotions to drive prices for the sale. However, bank auctions have prove all the time that 80-90% of the houses will remain unsold in every auction. It only works well for property that is unique, rare, famous or infamous. The infamous "haunted" landed house at Upper Thomson was auction off at a far above market value last year......a feat that would have been impossible if it is through a normal sale. In cases like these, auctions work well because of all the hype that happens before the auction.
 
But for common HDB properties.....auction to me is pointless. Furthermore the expected selling price for this EM is around market value......not like it is asking for way below market value.

I think we have established that 400-600m is our tolerance for the 'near MRT' definition...
 
 I consider walking distance from MRT only if it is under 10 minutes walk or  less than 600m.

yes, 1/2 km (500m) is the max max liao ...
600m is already pushing the limit
else any agent can say 1.0-1.5km walk is sup sup water and take it as exercise ... which they already practice now 

 
Haha I totally agree.. I will always give those agents the "WT Fish" look when they mentioned that  >= 600m to 1 km is a decent distance..
 
My parent's and my new place both are 3 mins walk to the nearest MRT station. I'm too pampered and will not consider anything more than 6 mins of walking.

Hmmm. It depends. 800m under shade, trees, building or thru mall is definitely ok. 500m with no shade is a totally different story. I will take 800m under shade. Try walking on a 400m running track on at 12 noon.

It’s for the individual and his or her family to decide how far or how near is optimal.
 
For someone who walks kilometres daily 1km is no problem if the price is good. For someone who lives directly above MRT, 100m is too far. Car Drivers who are confident of driving for the next 30 years with bus stops serving many bus routes nearby, and certain amenities like international schools nearby, MRT distance may not be the most critical consideration.
 
But for most people, below half km is indeed ideal.

Its foolish to think that Singapore has ample land. Do you even know only ~17% of our land is zoned for residential?
And our government may be welcoming more foreign talents to help boost GDP at a steady 1~2% every year. Most "investors" don't even know such simple knowledge...how to invest...haha
I am an investor myself. I was taught by a mentor on how to invest in properties previously.
 
5 Golden Rules for Property Investment:
1. Entry Price
2. Transformation
3. Rentability
4. New better than Old
5. Strike when sentiment is weak
 
Its all very logical actually. And based on these 5 rules, you can easily spot opportunities with minimal risk. There are a few good picks right now in the market, one of the developments i'm eyeing on is the upcoming EC launch in Sumang Walk. ECs still hold very good value because of the discount they have from market. 
 
Piermont Grand has very good potential capital upside. Its current location is one that is undergoing transformation - To allow Singapore to stay competitive in the Digital Age and soon Virtual Age. With all this plans for the future, prices in the area will potential sky rocket.
If you have not checked out Piermont Grand, I highly recommend you to do so. Link here: https://www.thepiermonts-grand.com/
You sound more like a property agent than an investor. 
To me a true property investor owns multiple (private) investment properties apart from the one for own stay.
 
EC owners can't be "investors" since new ECs are bounded by HDB rules and therefore are likely to be a primary residence, not an investment property.

Anyway, still no comparison between HDB and PTE, doubt this to drive developers to upgrade their finishes, which have always been the norm to attract buyers, with internal competition within private projects.

We do not know HDB's cost to begin with.
 
Hence, the "free" upgrades is likely just pure marketing by HDB.
 
I believe it is a prelude to price increase by HDB for the next batch of BTOs.
 
Pte housing developers will always cut corners, so do not expect freebies from them.

Some developers may not especially if they are mostly serving the high end segment, but some developers who serve the mass segments do look at what the current standard finishes in BTO and then offer theirs accordingly.  I do not want to name names here but those in the industry should know.

Some developers may not especially if they are mostly serving the high end segment, but some developers who serve the mass segments do look at what the current standard finishes in BTO and then offer theirs accordingly.  I do not want to name names here but those in the industry should know.I see... thanks for the insider info. I would say ... go for more reputable developers.

Buying resale flats may also potentially face a lot of competition by cash rich owners whose previous property was successfully enbloc. This is especially so for popular locations(e.g. near MRT, central) / rare units(e.g. high floor unblocked, big floor area), etc. Young couples wld not likely be able/willing to offer the same type of "sensible*" price to the sellers.

IMHO, i think its 'crazy' to pay those above 1mil type prices for a HDB resale in popular locations. 
Young couples should start off with getting a BTO at a more 'sensible' price/full lease/brand new.

Yup, some of these writeups whenever there are new launches, or existing launches having to clear units. 
Retail biz tough, nowadays most shop online or only go to big malls for more variety.

In terms of absolute price, it is the most expensive penthouse sold this year to date. The price for the 6,555 sq ft unit translates to $4,805 psf.
 
The price of $4,805 psf for the just-sold penthouse at 3 Orchard By-The-Park is higher than the average price of $3,695 psf for typical units sold within the development, based on caveats lodged with URA Realis to date.

Real Estate Investment Sales Up Despite Slowing En Bloc Market
 

total real estate investment sales increased by nearly 34 percent to $6.3 billion in Q1 2019 from $4.7 billion in Q4 2018.
 
“Although the outlook for private residential market was more subdued after the announcement of the eighth round of cooling measures in July 2018, developers were still actively seeking sites that have great connectivity and potential for future growth,” 
 
The government land sale (GLS) site at Middle Road, for instance, attracted 10 bids from developers during the close of its tender.
 
the sale of the Pasir Ris white site for almost $700 million to a consortium comprising Allgreen Properties and Kerry Properties emerged as the biggest deal sold via state tender.

Those who really aspired should have committed within the last 10 years' time frame. Those who did not were either extra prudent, had much more productive use of money, or just plainly could not find a way to loan the mortgage and / or pay the deposit. In any case, they would not be too unhappy given that general HDB prices have not moved much if any (except those very rare cases). 
 
In any case, some of the young may have learned to live without owning any home, just as they do not aspire to own a car. If they wanted to, they could pick up a HDB, but some of them may just be content living with parents or renting. Or even adopt reverse rent strategy (rent out their HDB and rent a condo) if they really wanted to live in a condo or switch locations.

Tan is in no hurry to sell the house and has even refused an offer from former Singapore President Tony Tan. “Today, if someone wants to buy from me, my heart shakes to let go of it because you can never get it again,” he says.
 
He acknowledges that “in life, you have to move on”. Tan adds: “I will only sell this place if the price is right.” However, he declined to reveal either his asking price or the former President’s offer price.

https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/three-bedroom-unit-one-amber-earns-148-mil-profit
Three-bedroom unit at One Amber earns $1.48 mil profit
 

The sale of a three-bedroom unit at La Suisse, a condo on Swiss View Road in District 11, earned its seller a profit of $1.63 million (177%) on May 31. The 2,099 sq ft unit changed hands for $2.55 million ($1,215 psf), having been bought for $920,000 ($438 psf) in November 2006.
 
The second most profitable deal during the week was at One Amber in the Amber Road neighbourhood in District 15. A 1,453 sq ft, three-bedroom unit on the seventh floor was sold for $2.55 million ($1,755 psf) on May 29, having been bought for $1.07 million ($742 psf) in December 2006. Hence, the seller reaped a $1.48 million (138%) profit.

Those who really aspired should have committed within the last 10 years' time frame. Those who did not were either extra prudent, had much more productive use of money, or just plainly could not find a way to loan the mortgage and / or pay the deposit. In any case, they would not be too unhappy given that general HDB prices have not moved much if any (except those very rare cases). 
 
In any case, some of the young may have learned to live without owning any home, just as they do not aspire to own a car. If they wanted to, they could pick up a HDB, but some of them may just be content living with parents or renting. Or even adopt reverse rent strategy (rent out their HDB and rent a condo) if they really wanted to live in a condo or switch locations.
Yes yes. Their fault for not committing when prices are low. 
Even if sec sch student also should have known to take a loan from mama Papa to buy what.

I bought my first private property in 2005.  I was young, naive and probably didn't think that much.
 
I remember at that time, there were many TOP balance units. They have big billboards outside the condos quoting discounts and all.  Every where I drove, I saw all these boards. Some of these condos are just right outside the newly constructed circle line MRT stations (not operational yet in 2005) but they have many completed units unsold even with discounts.
 
At that time, there were no data, no property guru, no transaction records. Nothing. All I see were billboards. So I just chose one freehold condo walkable  to the new circle line station and bought a unit I can afford. I didn't know it was good time or bad time, I just knew that if nobody wants to buy and these units are selling at a discount, then I would probably bought at an ok price.
 
My point of saying this story is that a lot of people tend to overthink when comes to properties. If I had overthink and procrastinated,  I probably be still sitting on the fence like many others do at that time and look back thinking why didn't buy 10 years ago.  There is no good time or bad time, as long you bought at the right price. With today's technology, many data are readily available  to calculate the right $psf to buy.......and as long that is ok and it is within your affordability (which the gov had built so many buffer in place) don't overthink and just go for it.

Buddy, you were lucky...
If you had randomly bought in 2013, you may be worse off now.
Sure, generally the trend is up, but there are many folks who were burnt.
 
Too many people make it sounds like it's a sure bet. But there are many who are still hurting.
 
So buy with money you can spare, don't gamble and do your homework. That's my personal non professional advice..

Housing in Singapore is usually 5 to 10 times the annual salary of a person and is most likely the 2nd largest economic decision. Better think once, twice and then thrice.

Yes i would definitely agree, dont need to overthink, especially over the silly data.
 
Only a few things to truly seriously consider.
What those few things are, are as different between people as day and night
Once that consideration is over.  
It’s just execution and taking it through (aka putting money where mouth is)
 
Affordability is equivalent to how much risk one is willing to put on the table
Not too different from showhand on every single time one signs on the dotted line.
The above applied to me.  
 
If one has mountains or hills backing them, then all these dont really apply any more
 
I bought my first one in 1999/2000
 
 
Today it is riskier becos the stakes are even higher
Good luck..

Anybody in this forum long enough know that I don't do property agent talk in this forum.
 
Neither do I sit in showflat and hoping for some some walk-in so that  I can do agent talk.

To be fair, he didnt advise dont think so much per se.Just dont overthink.
 
Becos if one is overthinking, then it is clear that one is NOT ready. Better to stop and take a step back.
 
In terms of Data. Some are worth analysing, others are just plain distracting.
Very similar to financial investing too.
 
But of course, to prop agents just like insurance agents, there is always a reason to buy buy buy.
 
Have a restful night folks.

This time, it is not easy even for first time buyers of new private properties
Outside CCR, new LH condos are going for 1800-2000pfs, Bukit timah LH condos 2000-2400pfs etc
Even with downsizing of units, rise in salary, the pricing and loans look frightening
When is the rise in price going to end (outside CCR going to hit 3000pfs in due time??), if at all, with all the cooling measures still in place
Some condos still hitting historic high in 2018-2019

This I fully agree.
 
Today, the market is very mixed. On one side, you have high prices for new launches, and on another side,  you have reasonably price resale, but they could be quite old.  Then there are ABSD to consider.  Besides ABSD,  buyer also face a slew of financial restrictions in their eligibility to buy.  This added a lot of complexity that doesn't exist 10-15 years ago.
 
Hence, the consideration has to be deeper and probably longer. That's perfectly ok.
 
However, there are people who after analysing, considered, saw green light in every direction but still procrastinate. Then 10 years later, they look back and think they were simply unlucky.

Honestly, I am not sure what is the significance of the above data from URA. However, I see it reported all the time in prime time news, media, etc. It gives a false impression that the market is improving.
 
So what if more new homes were sold in May than April? It is probably just because there were more new mass launches in May than April. Or so what if the coming August is going to sell less homes than July? It's probably just because August is the 7th month and almost no launches in that month.
 
There is no significant meaning in such data except to report for the sake of reporting. 
 
It is probably better if they report and compare the sold rate  in % (number of units sold/total number of units launched) for that month. If the sold rate is going up, then we know that buyers are increasing and market sentiment is improving.

What I have hinted for years.
 
Buying a property that fits one's needs and intentions, finding a seller that sells within or lower than one's budget after comparing similar products in same area, those are infinitely more crucial than which phase of the market we are at or what the index or sales data say.

https://www.finews.asia/finance/28985-uob-stands-by-offer-to-buyers-of-projects-under-receivership
UOB Stands By Offer for Incomplete Projects
 

United Overseas Bank (UOB) has reaffirmed its offer to bear the additional costs to complete the construction of two unfinished residential projects in Singapore which have been put under receivership.
 
The bank, which is the mortgagee in two incomplete projects - Sycamore Tree and Laurel Tree - told local newspapers that its offer remains conditional on the home buyers waiving their rights to claim liquidated damages, or compensation that developers must pay buyers for delays.
 
«UOB's offer will save homebuyers from having to make additional fund top-ups beyond their agreed unit purchase price. This is subject to all the homebuyers agreeing not to deduct any claims for liquidated damages against their remaining scheduled payments to be made into the project accounts,» said a UOB spokesman who was quoted in «Business Times» (Behind paywall).
 
Tender Process Started
 
The receivers for both Sycamore Tree and Laurel Tree have started a tender process to identify financially sound and quality contractors to determine the cost to complete the construction. «Given the complexities and after evaluating the various possible courses of action with new contractors assessing and taking over the completion of the delayed projects, we have offered to cover the additional costs expected to be incurred,» the spokesman added.
 
Based on the sale and purchase agreement, the developer will have to pay liquidated damages of 10 per cent per annum of what buyers have to pay. The waiver is necessary to protect future progress payments from potential liquidated damages, which could result in insufficient funds to complete the projects.
 
Examining Project Accounts
 
About 183 people were affected when construction of the 70-unit freehold condominium at Laurel Tree in Hillview Terrace and the 96 residential units and 17 shops at Sycamore Tree in Joo Chiat, stopped after the project accounts were found to have insufficient funds for the next phases of construction.
 
The two freehold projects were supposed to have received their Temporary Occupancy Permit in 2016. Astoria Development was the developer behind Sycamore Tree, while Lerida was the developer of Laurel Tree. Both developers are linked to Tan Hock Keng, a former property player. The Controller of Housing at the Urban Redevelopment Authority is studying the project accounts of the two projects to check whether money earmarked for them has been misused.

https://sbr.com.sg/residential-property/in-focus/luxury-homes-buck-residential-sales-decline-in-may 

URA Realis data shows that almost 30%) of new home sales or 273 units were transacted above $2,000 psf.
 
“New homes transacted at this price sky-rocketed 661% from 36 units in February to 273 units in May this year, which is also the highest number inked since December 2013 (295 units),” 
 
“Of the 273 transactions, 193 units were from RCR which is a historical high number of new homes sold above $2,000 psf for the market segment,”
 
In another solid showing for the luxury segment, ultra-high-net-worth investors remained upbeat as 48 new homes were also sold for $3m and above, which is the highest number inked since May 2018 with 56 units.
 
URA noted that another 28th floor (527 sqm) unit at Boulevard 88 was also transacted last month for $28m or $4,936 psf, surpassing the previous record of $4,927 psf for another unit at the same project inked in March 2019.
 
“However, this month saw an even higher priced 28th floor unit (562 sqm) at Boulevard 88 being transacted for a record smashing $5,125 psf, which is the sixth most expensive condo by psf sold on record (since 1995). By price quantum, this unit was transacted at $31m, which is the fifth most expensive condo sold on record (since 1995),”

So why not you enlighten us then, on current buyer demand/sentiment? 

 
Yes, sold rate up or down will still be reported as it is, but at least they are meaningful data.
 
For example
 
Sold rate for April is 735 (unit sold)/950 (units launched) = 77%
Sold rate for May is 952/1394 = 68%
 
The sold rate (or take up rate) actually drops from April to May even though May sold more homes.
 
If we chart the trend of monthly sold rate over a year, that will give a good indication of buyer sentiments over that year
 
If we chart the trend of monthly unit sold, that tell us nothing.
 
If you want ground info.....I will tell you it is weak. But if people want to believe that May sold 29.5% more homes than April and hence market is getting better, be my guest and probably even good for my business.

UNDER THE HAMMER: Unit at Marina Bay Suites for sale at $5.8 mil

Sad to say, this Marina Bay Suites seem jinxed. As the units are mostly large, they couldn’t push out most of the units and developer was also not aggressive in selling in anticipation that after TOP, better sales would come about which didn’t pan out as expected. Then they had a fire which took the lives of 2 security guards and so its been downhill for this condo I’m afraid.

There are still a lot of launches in the 2nd half of this year due to the enbloc in 2017 to 2018.
 
It is going to get quite interesting to see the pricing.

To be fair, he didnt advise dont think so much per se.
Just dont overthink.
 
Becos if one is overthinking, then it is clear that one is NOT ready. Better to stop and take a step back.
 
In terms of Data. Some are worth analysing, others are just plain distracting.
Very similar to financial investing too.
 
But of course, to prop agents just like insurance agents, there is always a reason to buy buy buy.
 
Have a restful night folks.
Tomorrow is gonna be another stressful day.

 
I think its the "sure win" menta that is causing the hesitation. When they want to buy, the question on the mind is will it drop further. Am I at the lowest. Is there something better in the pipeline.
 
A sort of the one that got away syndrome.
 
While those that selling always worry that they can get a better price.

Amazing.. the lowest psf on that list was above 1300... 
What’s the current psf for a HDB and an EC?
Unless one needs a private place, stick to the government subsidized ones, pocket the difference and buy a Merc...
Or go all the way and get FH landed :)

Got holding power is sure win. The question is win by how much. 
Right now is market distortion created by authorities who have already explained rise in tandem with economic fundamentals.
 
No holding power is 70-30, chance of loss indeed. 
 
Big losses may come from those who bought before all regulations.

Yes, sold rate up or down will still be reported as it is, but at least they are meaningful data.
 
For example
 
Sold rate for April is 735 (unit sold)/950 (units launched) = 77%
Sold rate for May is 952/1394 = 68%
 
The sold rate (or take up rate) actually drops from April to May even though May sold more homes.
 
If we chart the trend of monthly sold rate over a year, that will give a good indication of buyer sentiments over that year
 
If we chart the trend of monthly unit sold, that tell us nothing.

Current pricing is caused by distortion from the enblocs in 2017 to 2018.
 
They are not supported by rental or income growth, and our manufacturing sector has been greatly affected.
 
2018 and 2019 may represent the peak pricing of 99 years leasehold condos.

Remove all regulations, and we will see a truly free market, free from all distortions. 
Enblocs is based on developer needs for supply.
 
Govt has been careful to run ahead of the curve in terms of price growth not exceeding economic fundamentals.
 
It’s very easy to reverse the other direction the moment things are not right, say economic downturn.

Just buy and don't think so much is typical property agent talk.
 
Housing in Singapore is usually 5 to 10 times the annual salary of a person and is most likely the 2nd largest economic decision. Better think once, twice and then thrice.
The thing is those have been follow this advice over the last many years have been proven right and wise, those who did not becomes otherwise.  By the way what is a person's largest economic decision? Isn't it not house ?

I don’t think the above statement is true... if u look at maybe more than 20 years ago like before 1996, then everyone probably made money. 
If u look at the past 20 years, I think some made money, some lost money esp if u adjust for borrowing cost, opportunity costs ....
 
If u look at the past 10 years, I think it probably a worse picture as the returns is not good at all. How u know those who did not buy house did not invest in something with better returns?

Returns was actually extremely good in the last 10 years due to the extremely low cost of leverage. A capital sum of 500,000 invested would have doubled including rent and deducting all costs.

I wonder how many units does ‘overwhelming response ‘ translate into... 10?  ;)Sold just slightly more than 10 ... by about 10X more ;)

1996 profit 230%
2005 profit 155%
2007 profit 145%
 
https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/unit-8-napier-incurs-969000-loss
 
The greatest loss incurred over the week in review was from the resale of a 2,013 sq ft, three-bedroom unit at 8 Napier in District 10. Having sold the property for $6.29 million ($3,124 psf) on June 10, the seller sustained a 13% loss of $969,000. The unit was purchased in December 2007 for $7.26 million ($3,605 psf). Over a holding period of 11.5 years, this translates into an annualised loss of 1%.

On the other hand, the seller of a unit at 336 River Valley made the top gain of $2.72 million over the week of June 4 to 11. The 1,582 sq ft unit on the 11th floor was bought for $1.18 million ($746 psf) in May 1996, and sold for $3.9 million ($2,462 psf) on June 7. He reaped a 230% profit, or an annualised profit of 5% over 23 years.
 
The second top gain made over the week – a 145% profit of $1.42 million – was at Katong Gardens, off East Coast Road in District 15. The 1,948 sq ft, three-bedroom unit on the 2nd floor was purchased for $980,000 ($503 psf) in April 2007, and sold for $2.4 million ($1,232 psf) on June 10. This means that the seller made an annualised profit of 8% over 12 years.
 
A unit sold at The Makena, on Meyer Road in District 15, made the third most profitable transaction over the week, netting a 155% profit of $1.21 million for the seller. The 1,292 sq ft, three-bedroom unit on the 7th floor was bought in April 2005 for $775,000 ($600 psf), and sold for $1.98 million ($1,533 psf) on June 11. The seller therefore made an annualised profit of 7% over 14 years.

Sales would protect the receiver more, in case of disputes.
 
And in some cases, if the mortgage is not redeemed (for example CPF used in financing), transfer may not be possible.

i mean if it is between one family member to another, and no need for loan, the consideration is probably more about legacy plannning or getting round various hurdles and restrictions, would we get invited to kopi with iras if our price transacted is nominal or way below market?
 
@icedbs, any experience or advice on this?

stamp duty is to legalise the documents. And it is mandatory to do that.
 
Even decoupling also has to pay stamp duty. The party that is buying over the share of the other party has to pay stamp duty of that share.

I prefer not to talk about this matter openly.  Best discuss with a conveyancing lawyer because everyone's case is different. If CPF money is involved when buying that property, there are also other implications.

interesting....i had always thought stamp duty is a levy on transaction based on the observation that it is usually computed on a % of the transacted price.  another reason for me thinking so is because there are many agreements required by corporations and businesses for which many of them are un-stamped.  for these business agreements that are un-stamped, they can still form a legal position for respective parties even if un-stamped?

Sorry, when I say legalised, I was refering to property related documents.
 
From IRAS website:
 
Stamp Duty is a tax on dutiable documents relating to any immovable property ("property") in Singapore and any stock or shares.
 
I don't think business agreements is part of the above unless it involves transfer of shares.

I think ( not really sure , maybe experienced bros here know better ) if father puts it in his Will and bequeaths to his family member or outside person ( beneficiary)  then no need to pay Stamp Duty and ABSD izzit right ??

If the father is now deceased, there's no tax or stamp duty..
I believe the question was whether there's tax if he is alive..

Yes, I remember reading somewhere that if there is a will and a passing, there is no stamp duty.
 
But passing away without will and inheriting property that is kept, must pay stamp duties.
 
So planning for inheritance is important.
 
But important to consult professionals in the business. These are just my impression.

Yes it’s with the view of onpassing the property with view of gifting / bequeathing to beneficiary after his demise only ; which is the only way out of avoiding paying all that transfer  stamp duties and also ABSD to the beneficiary ( if he has already got existing properties ) Only some legal expenses incurred

Expat living is cheaper in Singapore than Hong Kong: study
 

Although Singapore moved one notch in the world's costliest cities for expats, the city still trails behind Hong Kong which holds the distinction as the world's priciest, according to Mercer's annual cost of living survey. Singapore also trails behind Tokyo which occupies second place.
 
The high cost of living in Singapore was fueled by sustained demand for quality housing and rising affluence.
 
Singapore was hailed as the second most expensive housing market in the world, with price basis of about $1404 (US$1,036) psf compared to that of Hong Kong where average property costs a whopping $2,833 (US$2,091) psf, according to an earlier report from CBRE.

And they won't mind paying prices here, these HKG birds will be even more powerful than the local SG birds..
Their "cheap cheap" cry will drown out the shouts of overpriced apartments by the locals.
Coupled with the money from en bloc sales, the local market may yet find another pair of legs to keep running high..

Hence, I expect prices of new launches to correct by about 10% in 2020.New launch won’t correct due to the very high price paid by Developers for the land, plus escalating costs. 
There are also no new GLS or enbloc that is won at low price. Unless we have huge new supply at low prices won by Developers, which happened between 2013-2016. Sites obtained from 2017-2018 have high price tags, and there are very few supply from 2018.
 
That about summaries the story. 
 
Only chance of cheap sales is to look for older resales.

The very high psf of private properties are neither supported by HDB upgraders nor rental.  The current froth is from the 2017-2018 enbloc and supply seems to be too much.  Hence, I expect prices of new launches to correct by about 10% in 2020.
 
For private residential, I personally think that a 10% correction is only possible if the authorities want it so.  Currently, this market segment is too tightly control such that the normal economics of demand and supply have very little influence to the prices. 
 
So I tend to read between the lines whenever the authorities/Minister make a statement.  Here is one which was reported in ST (May 31st 2019)  regarding the thoughts from the Minister on the latest Cooling measures
 
"It was, as we had stressed then, not to bring down prices but to stabilise and moderate the cycle, and I think we have achieved that effect."
"We welcome investors to our property market, but what we want to ensure is that demand, regardless of whether it is local demand or foreign demand, doesn't cause the prices to move at a pace that outstrips fundamentals," Mr Wong said.

So there you go. I could be wrong though, so you decide.

It is actually worrying for Singapore to have property prices that is no longer supported by rental.  It means a few things to me as follows:
 
1. There is a mistake in urban planning that allocates too much land to housing instead of to manufacturing and commerce.  This raises the cost of business in Singapore while creating surplus of housing that depresses rental.
 
2. The economy is growing too slowly while living costs are increasing too fast.  The tenants cannot afford the rental that covers the installment (for a loan that is pegged to 60% of price) and other miscellaneous costs of a landlord.
 
Overall, Singapore is creating high-value jobs too slowly.  It ends up the old rich hogging the properties and the young mired in big property debt for the rest of their life.  I won't be surprised that the society wealth gap and discontent are increasing rapidly.
 
My take is the developers of the 99 years lease properties probably miscalculated in their enbloc offers.  2019 onward could be a very slow market.

"It ends up the old rich hogging the properties and the young mired in big property debt for the rest of their life."
 
Interesting comment
To some extend this is true as the so called "old money" are linked with the big landed of yesteryears and out of reach for many.
"new money" are tied to lifelong debts for many
Some may say prices in HK are higher, but private property prices here are at or near the peak for many sectors and tough for next generation with aspirations but without the "old money" to service. Lucky we still have HDBs.

I feel the enbloc is not really their call, it's the market's call. Every developer is competing, if they don't offer the correct figure, they will lose the enbloc project completely. This will result in less sales inventory which the market are still able to pay for the exorbitant selling price.

I think the government priced the enbloc fees wrongly for many years. Make it too lucrative for the Developers and thus they are willing to bid so high for them.  I think the last July measures is great.

Creating high value jobs without importing of expertise is hard.  
Grooming via the universities is slow, and by the times the graduates enter the workforce, some sector might become saturated or even obsolete.
 
Manufacturing and commerce is incredibly complex nowadays with internet market as a direct and cheaper alternative, other than the cheaper alternatives overseas and a more globalised population. Then there is the trade war that complicates matters further.
 
The gap is as it is (neither really widening nor narrowing), but with more expenses for the rich upcoming and more subsidies for the less fortunate, we are at an equilibrium.

Due to my time of entry, they are still generating positive cash flow and offer a buffer against sharp price correction.  They are freehold and I don't intend to sell them.  They are meant to fund my retirement.  However, I don't think this is achievable at the crazy psf now even for 99 years leasehold properties.

They are meant to fund my retirement.  However, I don't think this is achievable at the crazy psf now even for 99 years leasehold properties.Simply put, there is a time of entry for every private property owner, and especially in Singapore. Miss that window, and will have to eat sour grapes for the rest of life. 
2015-2016 prices are down yes, but some of the poorest quality private properties were also sold then, including if I am not mistaken two FH properties that were never completed to date.
 
The prices of today’s new properties are not meant for you, but those of yesteryear might be. It’s a real lesson to be learned by all. I also can’t afford today’s prices even if I wanted to, but I will be happy if they were to fall just for me. But logically would it happen under the new supply conditions? Chances are zero unless an “asteroid” level catastrophe strikes. And even then, it is only a very short window to respond (2009 first half year).

I'm just chillaxing here.  My last purchase was about 8 years ago.  There are better gurus out there who have thoroughly done their homework who can give you better advice.
 
My take is if one is really keen on property in the long term, then go for freehold or 999 years leasehold.  Those resale ones that are launched 5-10 years ago are the better value for money since they are not too expensive compared to new launch and their design and facilities are generally quite new.  Being near MRT stations and HDB neighbourhood hub will be a bonus.
 
If one is looking for a hassle-free investment return, local bank shares are a decent buy.

It is not surprising when you see that there are more new launches transaction than resale transactions. Under normal circumstances, there should be more resale transaction than new. 
 
Based on URA caveat data as of July 1, 52.7% of non-landed property transactions over the last three months came from new home sales, against resale transactions of 46.6%. Over the same period last year, new home sales made up 32.5% while resale transactions contributed 66%.
 
The new launches are selling at new benchmark prices, so it is not surprising when that pulls up the property index.

There are external forces that can sometimes be really hard to predict, from the trade war to QEs to the probable influx of hk investors. 
It's not so simple as just looking at supply of impending demand or wind30's previous suggestion of falling prices due to interest rate hikes..
 
Singapore is just so small that predicting the weather is already so difficult, don't even talk about property.
 
I can't say if prices will go up or down for others in future but I can say for myself if I should buy for myself today or tomorrow.

It's not so simple as just looking at supply of impending demand or wind30's previous suggestion of falling prices due to interest rate hikes..
 
Singapore is just so small that predicting the weather is already so difficult, don't even talk about property.
 
I can't say if prices will go up or down for others in future but I can say for myself if I should buy for myself today or tomorrow.

 
Whether it goes up or down by 10% doesn't matter to me as I'm no longer buying or selling properties.  I just chit chat here when I'm feeling a little bored or for academic exercise  

With private property so expensive, it is much better to buy a good BTO.
 
My gut feel is BTO prices will have to go up due to higher upfront costs as well as preparing funds to upgrade the older estates.

Private home prices in surprise rise to five-year high
 

Private residential property prices rallied in the second quarter to hit a five-year high, flash estimates noted yesterday.
 
Increases in the city centre and city fringe helped lift the price index by 1.3 per cent to 150.5 points - the highest since the first quarter of 2014, when the index was at 151.3. The rise for the three months to June 30 comes after a 0.7 per cent decrease in the first quarter.
 
the increase was unexpected given renewed global market volatility and the China-United States trade war.
 
Singapore's status as a "safe haven", which helped sustain sales even amid uncertain times.
 
"This shows that investors and buyers are still positive on the long-term prospects of the residential market and take the short-term volatility in their stride,"
 
Yesterday's flash estimates from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) showed increases across the island.
 
Prices of non-landed private homes rose 1.5 per cent in the core central region compared with the 3 per cent fall in the previous quarter. The rest of central region recorded a 3 per cent rise after the 0.7 per cent decline in the first quarter.
 
Values in the outside central region increased 0.5 per cent following last quarter's 0.2 per cent lift.

If economic slowdowns at real risk, we will be facing 2009 again. Real estate prices will cheong again the moment currency loses strength, interest rates plummet.
 
Better not. Slow growth would be happier outcome for all.

relax... no way economy will go down in anytime soon. Not at least until after US presidential election end of 2020. 
 
No incumbent US President will get elected with a bad economy. And Mr DT has many tools on his hands to boost the economy

Yes, subprime produce some really good opportunity. But that has since gone.
 
Those that wish for it to return need to also have enough MO as well as trigger the action when the event happens.

The liquidity released from the last crash is still floating around.
 
In this climate over the last 10 years, all fiat money has dropped in value, just a matter of which one dropping less.
 
In some cases, mass production of certain types of goods due to the rise of China and other developing nations meant that prices did not go all the way up.
 
But there is a limit to how low costs can be in those cases. And for property specifically, cost prices have only gone up along with massive, trapped liquidity, resulting in the humongous chain of measures that could be relaxed easily to maintain a steady uptrend, as had been done several times over the same period to balance the supply and demand.
 
Lastly, there is indeed some substantial last batch supply in the market. These have to be sold slowly stretching over their full eligible selling period, because once they are all sold, there would be very limited supply once again, but this time, it will be clear that there is not enough land, not even to sustain half the supply of the past decade.

Just need to know if uncontrolled (no CMs), prices would be at least 50% higher than what it is actually today with a real impending crash (without CM scenario).
 
Understand and accept that truth and one will know what to do.

UOL-UIC tie-up places top bid for Clementi Ave 1 site
 

A STATE tender for a 99-year leasehold private housing site along Clementi Avenue 1 has attracted five bids. 
 
Units of UOL Group and United Industrial Corporation tied up to place the top bid of S$491.3 million, which works out to S$788.31 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr).
 
Another state tender, for an executive condominium or EC housing site along Canberra Link in the Sembawang area, has drawn eight bids.
 
The highest bid, from MCC Land (Singapore), was at S$233.89 million, translating to about S$566 psf ppr.

I expect the developer to test water at $1,500 psf next year.  On the related announcement for the Canberra Link EC land below, it looks like ECs are moving up to $1,100+ psf.  These prices look very high to me.  The units are going to be very small.  I thought Singapore is entering technical recession in the next quarter.

If need or can see the need, must urgently buy le. 
Either invest or for own stay.
 
2016 was a better year to buy than 2017, 2017 better than 2018, 2018 better than 2019. Surely you know where this is all heading? Transactions didn’t really go up too much for the last 5 years. There are still huge pent up demand waiting to commit...
 
Unless you can touch conscience and say for sure don’t need. Then just turn away bah.

Land cost higher than Clement Canopy by more than $100 psf.What’s most likely to happen is that carpark provision may meet only 50-80% of units. 
That means they might be able to offer close to Clement Canopy prices, but carpark lots sold separately, or paid lots (balloting)?

https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/resale-unit-cairnhill-plaza-reaps-15-mil-profit
 

The seller of a unit at Cairnhill Plaza made the top gain of $1.5 million over the week of June 18 to 25. The 2,852 sq ft, four-bedroom unit on the 34th floor was bought for $3.5 million ($1,227 psf) in March 2007 and sold for $5 million ($1,753 psf) on June 21. The seller made a 43% profit, or an annualised profit of 3% over 12 years.
 
The second top gain made over the week – a 177% profit of $1.47 million – was at Teresa Ville, at Lower Delta Road in District 4. The 1,927 sq ft, four-bedroom unit on the 15th floor was purchased for $830,000 ($431 psf) in December 1998 and sold for $2.3 million ($1,194 psf) on June 20. This means that the seller made an annualised profit of 5% over 20.5 years.
 
A unit sold at Monterey Park Condominium, off West Coast Road in District 5, made the third most profitable transaction over the week, netting a 119% profit of $925,000 for the seller. The 1,367 sq ft, four-bedroom unit on the sixth floor was bought in November 2004 for $775,000 ($567 psf), and sold for $1.7 million ($1,244 psf) on June 20. The seller therefore made an annualised profit of 6% over 15 years.
 
On the other hand, the greatest loss incurred over the week was from the resale of a 3,369 sq ft, five-bedroom unit at The Berth By The Cove in District 4. Having sold the property for $3.75 million ($1,113 psf) on June 21, the seller sustained a 33% loss of $1.81 million. The unit was purchased in October 2007 for $5.56 million ($1,650 psf). Over a holding period of 12 years, this translates into an annualised loss of 3%.

1) First things first, they DID curb soaring home prices 
 
2) They also caused an overall slowdown in buying demand (but sparked some oversupply fears)
 
3) But even with higher stamp duties, certain new projects continue to enjoy healthy demand (while hitting new price highs)
 
4) However, the measures killed the en bloc market, and are likely causing the current holdback in new launches

Luxury market, whether we want or don’t want, is generally out of reach to the 95% of Singaporeans. 
But within reach to 30-40% of Singaporeans, are entry level and mid level non landed property, and those are the main sales and prices that are propped.
 
Luxury market, because of our minuscule size, will also be similarly supported and propped, but more so by international affluent buyers. My 2c.

Those looking for firesales will be disappointed.. 
 

 
Amid a slowdown in the property market and a souring business outlook, the Government is reining in the supply of private housing units being released in the second half of 2019.
The aim is to avoid worsening a supply glut with a squeeze on confirmed sites under the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme, which are put up for sale on pre-determined dates.
Only 1,715 housing units - including 480 executive condo (EC) units - will be up for grabs on the five confirmed list sites in the second half of the year. This is 15.3 per cent less than the 2,025 such units offered in the first six months of 2019.
For the year as a whole, only 2,875 private residential units - excluding ECs - would have been released into the market through the confirmed list. According to consultancy JLL, this is the lowest quantum since 2014, when the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) was imposed to ensure that property buyers do not overextend themselves.
In the past five years, the supply of private homes under the confirmed list has ranged from 3,095 units to 4,355 units, JLL added.
"The Singapore Government has maintained a cautious approach to its land sales programme... in view of the ample supply of housing units in the pipeline and the relatively muted residential property market," said Ms Tricia Song, Colliers International's Singapore head of research.
 
 
Including the reserve list, which can be triggered for sale only if there is sufficient market interest, a total of 6,430 potential units are on offer.

If there is a glut n the economy turns bad plus all banks are vested in China n India .. only easy way to stay afloat without MAS coming hard would be to claw back on housing loans and that’s a slippery slope.. so it timely to closed the tap  
But at the back of my mind is always, tightern the tap but ignore the huge leak from the big longkang????

I think private property cost is still on the rise, so better buy now while a property is still in development stage or if it's being offered at a reasonable price.

https://www.99.co/blog/singapore/james-dyson-has-bought-singapores-biggest-most-expensive-penthouse/
James Dyson has Bought Singapore’s Biggest, Most Expensive Penthouse
 

Sir Dyson and his wife are Permanent Residents (PRs) in Singapore.
 
The Straits Times notes that the penthouse is valued at over $100 million. The price supposedly paid for it, however, is $73.8 million; still the highest ever paid for a penthouse in Singapore. We were unable to determine if includes taxes (being PRs, the Dysons would pay five per cent ABSD on their first property).
 
 
Is it a good buy?
 
For owner-occupiers who can afford it? Sure. For investors? Don’t be crazy. You’re paying just over $3,000 psf for this development; other nearby properties, such as Skysuites@Anson, are going for about $2,100 psf (that’s about the typical range for the area). There isn’t much room for appreciation, and rental yields – in the current market – are likely to be just under two per cent (the average for residential properties is two to three per cent).
 
Wallich Residence is very much a “pure” luxury buy – like a super car or an $800 sushi dinner, this isn’t the kind of purchase you should expect to make money from.

The current resale market offers pockets of good bargains provided one knows where to look at.
 
I also realise there are more owners who buy and upgrade before selling their current home. For these people, in order to get their ABSD refunds, they need to sell their current home within 6 months and this is where they will price their home very reasonably and good fair value can be found.
 
Recently I was combing D10 Freeholds and there are condos which I feel is quite undervalued considering the developments in the vicinity. Initially I thought maybe these condos are older but when I do similar age comparison, I could not believe how underwhelm their $psf are. There are opportunities like this now for resale buyers.

So I guess they left out Vantage Mortuary Views for some selected units or most unitsI saw the design and I think the wide circular gap was oriented to the mortuary. Meaning, units won't see it directly. But, got to really choose the unit properly if really buying. That place is a daily cargo in cargo out place.

Amazing psf of yesteryear
2005 ($496psf) 2019 ($1,551psf) profit (213%)
 
https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/resale-unit-leonie-gardens-reaps-18-mil-profit
Resale unit at Leonie Gardens reaps $1.8 mil profit
 

The seller of a unit at Leonie Gardens made the top gain of $1.83 million over the week of June 26 to July 2. The 1,733 sq ft, three-bedroom unit on the 14th floor was bought for $860,000 ($496 psf) in July 2005 and sold for $2.69 million ($1,551 psf) on July 2. The seller made a 213% profit, or an annualised profit of 9% over 14 years.
 
The second top gain made over the week – a 48% profit of $1.45 million – was at Sky@ Eleven, off Thomson Road in District 11. The 2,713 sq ft, four-bedroom unit on the 20th floor was purchased for $3 million ($1,106 psf) in August 2008 and sold for $4.45 million ($1,641 psf) on June 27. This means that the seller made an annualised profit of 4% over 11 years.
 
A unit sold at The Trevose, off Dunearn Road in District 11, made the third most profitable transaction over the week, netting a 99% profit of $1.31 million for the seller. The 1,894 sq ft, four-bedroom unit on the fourth floor was bought in October 2003 for $1.32 million ($696 psf), and sold for $2.63 million ($1,388 psf) on June 28. The seller therefore made an annualised profit of 4% over 16 years.
 
 
On the other hand, the greatest loss incurred over the week was from the resale of a 1,464 sq ft, three-bedroom unit at Caribbean at Keppel Bay in District 4. Having sold the property for $2.12 million ($1,448 psf) on July 1, the seller sustained a 13% loss of $330,000. The unit was purchased in May 2014 for $2.45 million ($1,674 psf). Over a holding period of five years, this translates into an annualised loss of 3%.

HK/China power big money coming, can expect more demand to luxury properties.
 
 

https://www.straitstimes.com/business/property/braving-curbs-chinese-buyers-lead-foreign-revival-in-singapores-luxury-homesBraving curbs, Chinese buyers lead foreign revival in Singapore's luxury homes
 

Some of the Chinese investors are apparently buying into these luxury homes in the city state as a safety bet against the US-China trade war. Fresh interest is also being driven by instability in rival financial hub Hong Kong.
 
"The Chinese are coming," "The factors are the issue in Hong Kong and also the trade war... They are looking at the stability of our currency."
 
there has been a rush of potential Chinese buyers to view the property in recent weeks.
 
Other brokers said they were aware of four deals over the last three months where Chinese bought apartments worth $20 million to $30 million in Singapore.

This is a very odd situation..
80% of Singaporeans are supposed to be in HDB, so that leaves 20% in private. And some people are straddling both worlds, so let's add another 10%
 
If we have 6 million people, and another 2 million or so who are foreigners, that makes 3.6 million who are the target buyers. Yet sales are so wild..
 
So it shows that the local appetite for property is still high, despite what the numbers and news indicate..

Mild or wild? 
Not forgetting the basic down payment for everyone had been adjusted to 25% from last year.
 
That’s a cool 50,000 on top of 200,000 for a 1 million property.

Hong Kong government depends heavily on land sales to sustain its budget.  Hence, it colludes with the private developers to push up the land prices.
 
Singapore's property taxes are a significant chunk (~19% in terms of direct taxes in FY2017 excluding GST) of the budget too.

Alex Poh got 5m... No wonder he wants to champion the enbloc to go thru. 
And with 5m, he still wants to take loan for the 1m unit that he intends to buy.
 
This guy sounds like a mercenary to me.
 
And Auntie Hui.. so lich. Can buy 2 units and 1 for her son also. The son is very lucky to not have to worry about housing. He better pay it forward to his chewren. 
 
Why do I sound so sour grapes?

By the time we are spent griping, inflation would have made our money doubly smaller.
 
At many food courts, $6 food already can’t get one a full meal.
 
Pay higher and higher taxes and psf over the years just to own a property while those who committed enjoy the property and the appreciation (although slowed down by CMs), fun waiting meh?
 
If there is no spike up in prices, there is nothing to fall really.

be glad that we still have malaysia ringette for the average joe to go across the causeway to buy stuff to lower the expenses.

Take loan to enjoy low interest rates, or leverage to invest into even more units.
 
Ya, dun play play many richie rich folks out there, not just enbloc millionaires.
 
Those can afford to, faster buy for chewren before prices go crazy aka 'out of reach'
 
As mentioned often ... 'SG property, good to be in as soon as possible' 

 
I think its more of getting the right property as soon as possible.
 
You can kangchoing spider and buy, yet when come to selling, kanna stuck.
 
Buy only property where one would live in and not go with hype would be a better strategy. Never buy on fear .

Last weekend went to look see some of the showrooms around serangoon area with CO as her dad is shopping. We noticed that JUI and Woodleigh Residences will not have gym facilities. CO say the lack of gym reduces the attractiveness of the development by 50% for her  
Of course a mere 2 developments does not a trend make, but in my myopic experience all the condos I've visited over the years have a gym, even if small and under-equipped.
 
Just wondering if the gurus here have any opinion on this? Perhaps developers find that a majority of gym-going residents pay for external gym memberships anyway?

i think it is a must to have a gym.  for me, i find the bath tub unnecessary and the first item i would do away.  nowadays quite many new projects no more bath tub already.  if i can do away with the open balcony, i would also ask for it to be removed.

Interesting opinion. It seems that one of the selling points for JUI is the big balcony space. For the bigger units even the mbr has its own balcony!

What have you observed about the gym's usage in your time living there? Some people only need treadmill/stationary bike for 30 mins a day. Some only need a yoga mat. I need olympic barbell and pullup bar. Impossible to meet all needs as impossible to predict what kind of residents are gonna be living there. And might affect maintenance fees also.
 
Is it better to have a small and under-equipped gym then to have non at all? Just for discussion

talking about it, i am quite perturbed the basketball court in my condo has got so many players that residents like me also barely have chance to play.  i am thinking most of them must be outsiders.
Interesting opinion. It seems that one of the selling points for JUI is the big balcony space. For the bigger units even the mbr has its own balcony!
 
 
the big balcony has small devt charges (ie low cost) but allows developer to show a deceptively lower psf in order to market to buyer.  you google this forum page, there were many discussions in the past about humongous balcony for certain developments like Sky Habitat, whereby the balcony space could cost $0.5m.
 
open balconies have very low utilitarian value.

+1 Don’t stay in a condo if you worry about maintenance fees
The monthly fees can be substantial 
And a tiny gym may be worse than none
Just like those Mickey Mouse pools .. the cost of maintaining it isn’t much lower than a large one but you won’t be able to swim at all

Developers sell 821 private homes in June, 26% higher on year, down 14% from May: URA data
 

This came as 670 private homes were launched last month, down from 1,394 units in May as well as the 726 units in June last year.
 
There were only four new projects - Sky Everton, Lattice One, Seraya Residences and Sloanne Residences compared to nine in May 2019.
 
Last month's top-selling project was Sky Everton, which sold 134 units at a median price of S$2,523 per square foot (psf). This was followed by Treasure at Tampines which sold 70 units at a median S$1,320 psf, and Parc Botannia which sold 60 units at a median S$1296 psf.
 
"Moving forward, many developers are expected to fast-track their launches ahead of the lunar seventh month. Some newly launched or upcoming launches include the 1,468-unit Parc Clematis, 820-unit EC Piermont Grand, 188-unit Haus on Handy, and 186-unit View at Kismis."

Next most important forward data is that those who had bought HDB in 2013 to 2016 have their HDBs meet MOP. By completion rate, we are looking at something like 15,000 units every year.
 
A third will mean 5000 units; a fifth will mean 3,000 units of base demand.

I don't own a condo. But my take is a development without a gym = Apartment.
It's not a "condominium" 
Granted most condos don't even have tennis court nowadays due to limited area, but that one is still a luxury of space.
Even some apartments will have pool.

Apartments usually have a small pool, a small gym and a tiny BBQ pit at the minimum.
 
It is surprising that condos are cutting back on facilities and yet selling at ever higher prices.

HDB resale prices are dropping by about 1% each year since the peak in 2013 and large correction in 2014. 
I doubt there are many upgraders who can make the jump into new condos. Many may just upgrade to a bigger HDB.
 
I don't think the current price can sustain. It could be just a flash in the pan due to 2017-2018 enblocs.
 
There are still many upcoming launches so the real demand data could only be seen around end of the year.

Left right centre my relatively young relatives under 40, maybe a third are doing so or have already done so. 
Mostly is for primary schools or simple upgrade.

Don't say installation of blinds...some won't even allow you to put a drying rack at the balcony.
 
Occasionally I need to be the middle man between tenant and the MCST when they use a drying rack for their clothes at the balcony.
 
And people still think agent job is just viewing and closing.

Actually that applies to many condos..
Literally you aren't supposed to display your dirty linen / laundry in public view 
It has to go into the courtyard, or be hidden... 
Each new resident is given some SOP / rulebook when they move in. 
However over time, either the condo doesn't enforce this, or it gets changed at some AGM..

What can happen in India, can happen here too..
 

 
 	As bets on expensive property go bad, worries rise about shadow banking's impact on economy
MUMBAI • It was meant to be the tallest building in India, with luxury flats, a swimming pool and cinema where billionaires and Bollywood stars could enjoy a life of perfect splendour looking down over the Mumbai skyline.
But the Palais Royale complex now sits unfinished alongside other partially built structures tangled in the megacity's traffic-choked downtown streets, an apt symbol of a crisis that threatens a key part of India's financial system.
Over the past decade, some of India's largest financial groups have bet big that the country's fast-growing economy would breed a generation of rich bankers, lawyers and tech entrepreneurs eager to spend millions of dollars on luxury flats in the country's largest cities.
A group of gutsy shadow banks willing to fund such projects were rewarded with roaring growth. These non-bank financial companies, like Palais Royale's financier Indiabulls Housing Finance and other large groups like Dewan Housing Finance, soon became a big part of India's financial system. Shadow banks grew to account for a fifth of all new credit last year, and became the largest source of funding for real estate, thanks to loan growth of more than 20 per cent a year between 2013 and last year.
But those bets on expensive property have now gone bad in an economic downturn, scaring off buyers and choking the flow of credit. That has left the real estate sector with a formidable mound of debt: Developers collectively owe about 2.5 trillion rupees (S$49 billion) to the non-bank financial sector.
"If the big players fail to get money, it can quickly have a domino effect. And that is the real scare," said Mr Sachchidanand Shukla, chief economist of the Mahindra Group conglomerate.
 
 
Property consultancy Anarock estimates that half of the luxury real estate in Mumbai's downtown alone is unsold: 11,000 properties worth a total of 590 billion rupees.
 
Analysts say these billions of dollars stuck in illiquid luxury property now present a serious threat to India's economic health.
 
A frenzy of construction has gripped the Indian city of Mumbai over the past decade, but it now faces a glut of expensive housing. Unsold inventory in the city rose 14 per cent in the first half of this year from the same time a year earlier, according to Knight Frank. PHOTO: EPA-EFE 
"It has a massive impact," said Mr Ramesh Nair, India head of property consultancy JLL. "If the real estate economy doesn't pick up, the overall country will be in trouble."

Don't say installation of blinds...some won't even allow you to put a drying rack at the balcony.
 
Occasionally I need to be the middle man between tenant and the MCST when they use a drying rack for their clothes at the balcony.
 
And people still think agent job is just viewing and closing.
It does make the place look like a slump, albeit an atas slump. Underlying problem - space

There are some nice tasteful ways to reclaim the balcony:
- add Chengal wood decking
- the planter can be converted into a storage area
 
Use waterproof outdoor furniture from Homeshoppe - pretty nice and durable, and you can still use it as a place for drinks, relaxing or even doing real work..

Apartments usually have a small pool, a small gym and a tiny BBQ pit at the minimum.
 
It is surprising that condos are cutting back on facilities and yet selling at ever higher prices.

 
 
actually sometimes i am lost in the rules of classification....example: rivergate condo have al the facilities and by no means small, yet classfied as apartment by propertyguru.

most likely the condo happened to have an overzealous condo manager or old schooled condo council members who walks around looking for such minor infarction. 
 
i have seen quite a few condo seal up their open balcony with those smart windows or blinds....
 
last time when i wanted to install drying rack at the external facade of my yard area, i also bo chap, just install.
 
most times if bother to ask, will not be approved.  because all condo managers also err on the side of caution.  rather tell us  cannot, than tell us can.

new launches with smaller unit sizes still good uptake
 
there is a limit on the pfs and quantum, to a certain point, it cannot rise much further in short term
 
resale looks more subdued

 
usually brand new will move first.  this one is just human nature......they prefer something new and reasoned that it is the warranty.
 
that's not to say resale will not appreciate.  they still will, but will always take a longer time than first hand.  the older the condo, the longer time it needs to do catch up.  the basis is that after first hand units are sold at high price, there will be some value seekers preferring to buy resale because the psf is considerably lower.
 
i have seen average psf of some resale condos slowly creep up.  example melville park used to be selling about 500psf on average, now it has gone up to 6xx psf or 7xxpsf

Allgreen Properties to launch Juniper Hill on July 13
 
(The 115-unit, exclusive residential development on Ewe Boon Road is the second project to be launched under the developer’s Bukit Timah Collection. A first phase of 52 units will be released for sale)
 

 
Property Prices will eventually go up but would still depend on different factors. But as time goes by properties usually appreciate in value so it's best to buy now to avoid price surge.

"The uptrend is expected to continue as more freehold units will be launched in the coming months," 
 
"It is rare to have a good selection of premium, freehold projects being launched at choice locations. This could be a good opportunity for buyers to snag a freehold property; otherwise they may have to wait for the next collective sales cycle that is likely to take place many years down the road,"

Small District 9 condo sold in 2019's first residential collective sale
 

A SMALL District 9 apartment building has broken a more than six-month silence in the residential collective sale market.
 
The five-unit Sophia View was sold in June in Singapore to a private investor.
 
Marketing agent SRI declined to reveal the exact price tag coughed up but said each unit will get about S$2 million.
 
Sophia View, at 108 Sophia Road, is zoned residential and has a plot ratio of 2.1
 
the buyer is purchasing it in his own name and is "keeping his options open". The buyer will later evaluate whether he wants to redevelop the land or submit for potential change of use. 
 
"Essentially for this investor, he sees the potential upside of the area and value of the land and is taking a long-term view of the market."

Group buy?  sounds fun. Many psf cannot afford, a few square foot of land still can.If workable then let me know 
 
I think should have some refreshments, no buy but we can still MCF meet there for the free kopi/kueh?

Today we wonder why our parents did not get a piece of landed 30 years ago (any size based on their Budget and affordability).
 
We also wonder today why some of us did not grab any good freehold ten years ago.
 
Thirty years later for those who skipped the opportunity of our time, our children will also wonder why we did not opt for a LH private property (any size or location based on one’s Budget and affordability).

There's a nice HDB flat in Tiong Bahru, that I drive by often, and I always feel a tinge of regret for not getting it - complaining that it was expensive back when 400k for a place next to a MRT seemed expensive...
 
But I've been blessed with other homes, and many other things, and the love, warmth and joy provided by a good wife, and a meaningful job. 
 
Just like many things or people, some things aren't meant to be and it's ok. Enjoy what we have and that's enough

With the property structured this way, the odds are ever in your favour.
 
Don’t let the fruits go to foreigners.
 
Which piece of land bought 30 years ago in any country lost money today? Or for that matter, which private property?

That will be tough to find true blue Singaporeans because you need to trace back to Sang Nila Utama times when pirates still roamed the seas around Singapore. Then, you can probably buy the whole plantation land for $10

Some council members just like power to lord it over all. To me is small balls syndrome. Never had the power and authority in real life so seek to use powers as MCST to clamp down on this and that. Almost all got hidden agenda. Serve for free for the good of the condo? My big fat foot!  No different to grassroots!

I don't own a condo. But my take is a development without a gym = Apartment.
It's not a "condominium" 
Granted most condos don't even have tennis court nowadays due to limited area, but that one is still a luxury of space.
Even some apartments will have pool.
Legally I think to be condo, it’s not about gym, more like where you can built up to. A lot of developments in city are apartment because they want to maximise the space. 
Some apartments have Swimming pool gym plus tennis court.

If u have an outstanding bank loan on your property, and u are upgrading (sell and buy in short sequence).
Do you have to pay lawyer's fee for mortgage redemption if you are selling vs just outright redemption (pay up on your own)?
 
Just wondering whether i should redeem the loan early since i have available cash ...

I think depends on the lawyer. If you are selling, you have to get a lawyer anyway. I am not sure if there is a discount for the lawyer fee if your place has zero loan (ie fully redeemed)
 
How much is the interest on your housing loan anyway? Even CPF OA gives more interest...

3.0+% currently, pegged to 3mo sibor.
Bank loans for HDB were quite lousy at the time i signed up cos hardly anyone used them when i first signed up on buying the flat (and i was completely clueless back then and didn't even understand how did interest for 1mo sibor compute).  Had one free refinance already. 
 
Just 160k left ... so wonder if i should just pay it off

hmm also a possibility.
Never really thought about using CPF.
But doesn't really matter i guess, cos if i buy something, it will just be upgrading. So 2nd property withdrawal limits don't really matter.

After expanding 3.7% in 2017, Singapore’s economic growth tapered to 3.1% in 2018 and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected that it will slow to 2% in 2019. Growth had already decelerated to 1.1% in 1Q2019 and 0.1% in 2Q2019.
 
“Over the medium term, growth should stabilize around 2½ percent, increasingly driven by modern services alongside other trade-related sectors,” says IMF in a release on July 15, following the conclusion of its Article IV consultation with Singapore. “Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside and mainly stem from external sources, including a tightening of global financial conditions, escalation of sustained trade tensions, and deceleration of global growth.”

Yes it's also true that past performance is not representative of future performance.
 
one can also ignore the messages the government is sending out the last couple of years e.g. prices have stabilised, population 2030, prices tagged to income GROWTH etc.
 
Hindsight is 20/20 but foresight is the key when one is buying in. I am not saying that prices wouldn't fall. They prob will sometime in the short run and kudos to those that can buy at the lowest. But many are looking at the longer horizon.

 
looking back ~30 years, there were 3 years which gdp growth were negative with annual average gdp growth about 6%
 
looking at forecast for the next ~30 years from consultant report, it would be smooth sailing with annual average gdp growth at meagre ~2.3% as singapore economy matures further.  but thats the nature of forecasts not to include crashes of course
 
i think it would be prudent to assume there would be at least 1 crash if taking up 30-year property loans, if not more.  just make sure got enough holding power to withstand such events
 
the people with great foresight will be those who wait for any of those 3 years of course and not ignore market cycles unless buying their first matrimonial home to move on with their lives.

Master Shifu can wait 100 years for the “crash” to happen also. 
With no cooling measures, I would be the one shouting for crash today with the index 30% or more higher.

The most important line in the whole article above is this :
  IMF recommends adjustment to property cooling measures, eliminating ABSD eventually 
I doubt it will happen though.

My 2c worth..

 
The context is if there is a bank loan and the interest rate is high, it is better to clear it off totally using CPF.  The CPF can be re-built again by topping up with extra cash later.
 
However, if one still has a long term loan and the bank interest rate is below the CPF interest rate, it is better to continue with the loan while keeping the CPF as a reserve.

3.0+% currently, pegged to 3mo sibor.
Bank loans for HDB were quite lousy at the time i signed up cos hardly anyone used them when i first signed up on buying the flat (and i was completely clueless back then and didn't even understand how did interest for 1mo sibor compute).  Had one free refinance already. 
 
Just 160k left ... so wonder if i should just pay it off

 
3% is bloody high. Pay it off (CPF or cash) or refinance it.
 
I'm on 3 month sibor+
1st yr: 0.1%
2nd yr 0.2%
3rd yr: 0.3%

Someone who can wait for 30 years will have to wait for 100 years (or more) actually.
 
Just ask those who had been waiting since 1980s.
 
Miss that window, and it will be the game of future generations. Harsh truth I know.

In summary, invest with prudence. If you have a long enough horizon and holding power, and don't panic, you will make money.

Property market resilient despite economic uncertainty
 

While investors typically retreat to the sidelines in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty, property buyers in Hong Kong and Singapore have bucked this trend. During the weekend of June 22 and 23, while thousands of protesters besieged Hong Kong’s legislative building, units on sale were swooped up by eager property buyers. According to South China Morning Post, Sun Hung Kai Properties sold 116 of the 130 flats offered in the second sales phase of the Mount Regency complex in Tuen Mun; while in Yuen Long, out of the 128 flats on offer at New World Development’s Atrium House, 111 units were sold.
 
In Singapore, the same weekend saw the launch of Sustained Land’s freehold Sky Everton with nearly 40% or 102 units sold. To date, URA data shows that 134 out of a total of 262 units have been sold.
 
“So it tells you something: it’s very hard to bring down this residential animal. It is going up, and it wants to go up,” says Alan Cheong, executive director, research & consultancy, of Savills Singapore. Cheong was speaking at the EdgeProp 360 event, titled “Separating fact from fiction: The search for the best yield”, held at Capital Tower on July 10. His view is that while property resale prices will be “flattish” this year, prices of new sales are on an uptick.


According to Savills Research and historical data from URA, of the 26 interventions implemented by the Singapore government since 1981, only seven have been pro-market. However, the price index for all private residential property (including EC) has been on an uptrend, despite the many cooling measures over the years.
 
Cheong notes that because of rising household savings, property prices today are more affordable than they were even in 2013. A year since the last round of cooling measures, the market is “really healthy, neutral, [and] not in the bubbly territory”, he says. Even in the luxury market, the prices in 2Q2019 were “higher than even before the cooling measures”. Bearing in mind that many of the buyers are foreigners who pay a higher buyer’s stamp duty, the ultra-high, net-worth market is still going strong, says Cheong.
 
On the perception that transactions by foreigners have been propping up the Singapore property market, Christine Li, head of research, Singapore and Southeast Asia, of Cushman & Wakefield (C&W), asserts that the number of foreign buyers is exaggerated. Also speaking at the EdgeProp event, she said: “I just checked the data today [July 10]. The foreigners’ share of property actually dropped by 30% post-cooling measures.”
 
Li notes that the example of Hong Kong “speaks volumes” about how Hongkongers are “still very confident” about their market. Also, the mainland Chinese are still more confident about the Hong Kong market than about the Singapore market. Regardless, there is “always this 5% of foreigners who like Singapore, no matter how bad our economy is, [or] how bad the prospect for residential property is”, Li observes.


Property supply
 
Previously, the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme accounted for about 70% to 80% of supply of private homes, says Savills’ Cheong. In 2015, only 4% of the supply was from collective sales. Then came the collective sales fever from 2016 to 2018. “In 2017, 17% of the supply was from the collective sales market,” says Cheong. “This year, we will see the full flood of the supply from the collective sales market.”
 
As for the Singapore office market, there is a slight under-supply, according to C&W Research. Based on long-term average, demand outstrips supply, with absorption rate estimated at 1.4 million sq ft (msf) while supply is at 1.2 msf. This is despite new projects in the pipeline such as Guoco Tower.
 
In addition, the supply of commercial space in the CBD is shrinking. This is evident from the supply of commercial sites from the government’s Reserve List. The Marina View white site at Shenton Way, for instance, was designated to be a commercial site, and was allocated about 1.09 msf in 2011. In 2018, the same site had only 21,528 sq ft of commercial space for use, while the remaining space can be developed into a 540-key hotel and yield 905 residential units.
 
C&W’s Li says: “This is pretty much in-line with the 2019 Draft Master Plan, to make the place more vibrant.” She adds that the government’s long-term intention is to keep supply in the CBD low to encourage its decentralisation initiatives. “From what we have gathered, the CBD supply [will] only increase by 40%. If going by the supply pace as of now, in the suburban or the city fringe [area], the non-CBD supply is going to shoot up 178%,” says Li.
 
Away from the CBD, the decentralisation initiatives have spread across the island, namely to the Woodlands Regional Centre, Tampines Regional Centre, Paya Lebar Central, Labrador, Jurong Regional Centre, and Punggol Digital District.


Investment opportunities
 
Given these factors, C&W’s Li believes there are pockets of investment opportunities in the commercial market. “Since the residential en bloc is not happening … if you have the cash, you can consider commercial en bloc,” she says. Apart from the above-mentioned areas, she describes the Greater Southern Waterfront as a “very interesting growth area”, as it is three times the size of Marina Bay. The Greater Southern Waterfront can be “a city on its own”, Li asserts. “I won’t be surprised if there were to be a third integrated resort (IR) in this area,” she adds.
 
Meanwhile, Savills’ Cheong is undeterred by macroeconomic uncertainty and the possibility of rising interest rates. “It’s not that you should not hedge against interest rates. [The key is not to be] led astray by well-sounding arguments and opinionated pieces,” he advises.
Cheong adds: “If you can afford it, if you think that you have faith in residential property prices or the private residential property sector, just buy. I am really confident [about] the market.”

my parents bought a resale hdb flat at sky high price in 1997.  it went down and stayed down for longest of time.
 
in 2004 (if i remember correctly), we did approach an agent to sell and he turned down the chance to sell for us after he meet us up and find that we stil losing significantly if we sell then.  my experience is that we do meet ethical agents there and then.

I think your asking price too high lah... so maybe he find too hard to sell? 
I think everyone has their own motives. Maybe he find there is more to gain by rejecting u? 

How is this honest?

Ya Lor, it will be funny if the property drop 10% the next year... then good agent become bad agent. 
To me, I assume Everyman for himself, buyer, seller agent. No good agent who will look out for anyone interest except him own. No evil agent either. Got capable ones and useless ones though

No la. Reasonable asking. He is not turning down because of difficulty in selling.

On a separate note, you can see who will be your potential neighbours by looking at the crowd...
For new launches, one very positive thing for owner occupiers is that all the new owners are at a very similar stage of life. Similar values, etc. Not a bad thing.

Actually I don't know about that..
Some obnoxious noveau riche sorts
Some old money
Some investing
Some new families
Some en bloc sorts - don't forget, the occupants don't have to be the owners... :)
 
 

And paging the bro who was looking for a place... in case you haven't found a home, this terrace is snazzy man..

EC is special breed, not anyone eligible. For those who want brand new condo, even at record sale psf, still the lowest around compared to private. 
Personally if buying, I won't even bother with new launches today. High selling psf for new LH, can get resale FH.
Above 1k psf for new EC, can get resale private condo in a better location near to mrt...etc 
'Go resale for better value' 
 
That said, diff strokes diff folks. Just like some willing to pay record price for resale HDB

I think your asking price too high lah... so maybe he find too hard to sell?
 
I think everyone has their own motives. Maybe he find there is more to gain by rejecting u? 
Ya Lor, it will be funny if the property drop 10% the next year... then good agent become bad agent.
 
To me, I assume Everyman for himself, buyer, seller agent. No good agent who will look out for anyone interest except him own. No evil agent either. Got capable ones and useless ones though
Don't quite agree on every man for himself, even if we are talking about agents who are commissioned based. I'm sure there are established ones out there who look at job satisfaction. 
I'm not an agent but in my area of work, I do it more for job satisfaction than money as it does add more value to my life. Sure, money's important but I don't place it as the most important. I'm sure there are also others like you who may do that.
 
I'm sure you can find people who don't mind a paycut if a new job offers something more satisfying. Same goes for any industry.
 
Some agents may prefer to do deals that they feel value add and maybe selling houses at a huge loss makes taking commissions morally difficult for them. I'm not sure but this may be how I may feel in their shoes.
 
Your mantra here denounces those that do charitable work or help others without cost. Maybe you should catch some YouTube videos on how some exercise altruism..

Fully agree. 
Sometimes when I give recommendations to people, they will wonder if I get any commission from the workshop.
 
People are too cynical these days. 
 
What we say is a reflection of our own values and beliefs.

Actually these days it’s all fake sales hype...
 
I bought my first property at launch I think in 2001. Literally started queuing three four days in advance.... lucky developer bring forward launch date so queue only 1-2 days. Property was fully launched and everything sold in 1-2 days.....
 
Nowadays, all fake one. Where got any sold out after launch one...

?? Your example of charitable work is errr... the opposite of Property Agent.... 
Ok if the Property Agent does not take any commission from my deal, ie charity work, then I believe there is no conflict of interest. Tell me if u find such an agent. 
 
Even people who does charitable work fulfills their own personal desire to do good, their payback is not in terms of money but maybe personal happiness. 
 
At the end of the day, Property Agent is a job that earns through commission. Some smart ones will try not to burn bridges by introducing bad deals, but at the end of the day, their motive is commission, either through current deals, or through future deals (thus the effort to not screw their clients)

Let's not forget your earlier point was : No good agent who will look out for anyone interest except him own. you're seeing people through very coloured lens? 
I'm sure there are agents out there who don't mind taking a comms cut or do for free for those who have to sell due to extraordinary reasons i.e. an elderly person who has lost his job etc. 
 
I don't see why an agent has to do it for free for someone like you who can afford to pay though. This isn't even the point, look at what you've said before.
 
I would have done pro bono for special cases if I were an agent and many others here may do so too. 
 
I'm just making a point that it's not just every man for himself.
 
Not everything should be seen as so transactional. Anyway I'm digressing from the focus of this thread. It's just sad that people get so unduly cynical these days.

Cannot be agent don’t eat don’t feed kid what.... 
But that doesn’t mean agents are only self serving people. 
 
Any extreme view is likely to be wrong.
 
What motivates you to write in an online forum? For me, it’s a record for myself to match what I think will happen with what actually happens or is most likely to happen based on my interpretations, like a dated diary of sorts.

When I bought my first place, I was really trusting of my agent.. a friend's friend.
My last house hunt was filled with deception, falsehoods and fake claims that I'm now a skeptic. 
Keep every conversation, keep it in B&W and money talks. If it's not on paper, it's all talk.
Enough said.

Sadly such a**holes exist too. Had friends or friends' friends selling stuff at 'brother' price and ends up, the deal gotten is worse. Heck, sometimes even family members would take advantage, so yah..
 
N sorry it has to be like that for you and agree that B&W is key. But sometimes even B&W isn't enough. One shouldn't get overly cynical but one shouldn't be overly trusting too. Sometimes it's best to adopt a balanced approach.

I just add a bit on this point about engaging friends who are agents or friend's friend who is an agent.
 
I see a lot of people do this. Well, on surface, it is nothing wrong, since it is human tendency to work with someone they know because of the better trust factor.
 
However, people need to remember that transacting a property is a business because of the high financial stake involved. It is not as simple as asking a friend out to help you choose a pair of shoes.  So when someone choose an agent friend to transact property,  he need to first evaluate whether from the past knowledge of the friend, is he one who is capable of being a business partner? 
 
In other words, if that person has a million dollars  to invest in a business and need a business partner, will he choose that agent friend?  Often, the answer I get is no..because while these friends are fun to be with, they are probably not the kind they will go do business with.   Then why on earth do they even choose the same agent friend to transact their property where it is probably more than a million dollars?
 
Try to think of property transaction more as a business and you will know which agent to choose, whether they are friends or not.

I think what Invigorated is trying to say is that regardless which industry, there will always be people who put other people's interest first in their jobs and not just about money.  To say that no good agent or no good professionals who will look out for anyone interest except his own will be totally untrue.
 
I have lost count how many times I have fork out my own money to help landlord repair his house or spend time, effort and transport to search for some replacement parts for my landlord so that he can rent out/sell his house.. If I will to do it for commission, I wouldn't take up those cases.   And I am not the only one. There are good agents out there who serve with his soul and not with his wallet. Pretty sure it is not just agents, there are many other people; doctors, lawyers, or even normal employees who sacrifice either money or their time to help serve other people's interest first.
 
That's all I will say on this. If you do not agree, it is fine as well. I will respect that.

Condo where got need to reno ... already 'move in' condition.
 
(The condo will have a sheltered linkway to the upcoming triple-line Outram MRT station and has a "renovation-zero" concept as all units come with fully-integrated kitchens, built-in lighting, air-conditioning, cabinetry and curtains.)
 
If can choose different types still ok, or all units look the same 
Preference still to have option to choose own lightings curtains to add a personal touch.
 
Just yada-ing too 
Yup.  
Most move in condition if no plans to hack flooring, change kitchen cabinets, change white goods if not like brand, reposition aircon unit etc. 
 
Most times, kitchen flooring and bathrooms flooring left alone cos of waterproofing warranty.
 
Lightings, TVs, furniture, bed frames and mattresses are mostly bought once defects in unit rectified. Curtains and if there's balcony, blinds or invisible grills are installed at buyer's cost.
 
Anyways, those items provided by developer are factored into price of unit liao. Most will not do major reno but use these till wear n tear.
 
Still yada-ing. Thanks for joining.

I reckon this 'reno-zero' concept is to attract/cater to investor buyers, for a 'fuss free' rental all done up, with mostly one two bedders sold. 
Yup, factored into price marketing gimmick

Dun think so. More of a gimmick from developers to be different or value "add". 
Haha....really add lor. Frankly, perhaps a lazy buyer or one with a spoilt calculator or one who bought for flipping or rental may be excited with such "extras" thrown in.

I reckon this 'reno-zero' concept is to attract/cater to investor buyers, for a 'fuss free' rental all done up, with mostly one two bedders sold.
 
Yup, factored into price marketing gimmick 
Agree. The more "freebies" that come with this concept the better. 
Maybe "cheaper" for buyer if one not concerned about brand of appliances, country of origin of stuff etc as developer bought on economics of scale, thus enjoy project prices vs buyer getting these on his own in small quantity.

Rarely know anyone who buy to rent out nowadays, like last 3 years. 
Mostly buy to stay and rent out their existing.

I just add a bit on this point about engaging friends who are agents or friend's friend who is an agent.
 
I see a lot of people do this. Well, on surface, it is nothing wrong, since it is human tendency to work with someone they know because of the better trust factor.
 
However, people need to remember that transacting a property is a business because of the high financial stake involved. It is not as simple as asking a friend out to help you choose a pair of shoes.  So when someone choose an agent friend to transact property,  he need to first evaluate whether from the past knowledge of the friend, is he one who is capable of being a business partner? 
 
In other words, if that person has a million dollars  to invest in a business and need a business partner, will he choose that agent friend?  Often, the answer I get is no..because while these friends are fun to be with, they are probably not the kind they will go do business with.   Then why on earth do they even choose the same agent friend to transact their property where it is probably more than a million dollars?
 
Try to think of property transaction more as a business and you will know which agent to choose, whether they are friends or not.

 
 
tell me about it.  recently i was disappointed with my relative agent on handling of the tenant and sale as well of my house.  her communciation is weak and she don't seem to be able to carry out effectively the requirements of the landlord and home owner.  i wished i had never soften down to give her business which was at the suggestion of my mother.

recently i have started looking at ads for units on sale.  i was startled that asking prices seems to have generally taken a huge jump and the gap between asking prices and last done prices seemed to be quite high.  i can only surmise that the owners have holding power and see that the neigbouring new launch property selling so expensively, decided they also want to ask for a much more princely price to narrow their gap with the neighouring new launch.
 
example, tribeca owners are asking a cool 500-600k against last done of 2.72m because their asking psf is still lower than that of the LH99 rivierie.  also the metropolitan owners are asking for 200k in excess of valuation price, and the last unit transacted is more than 1 year ago. same situation, they also have a neighouring new launch, Artra project, selling at a premium over them.
 
 
these sellers are testing market for sure.  no buyer in their right mind will make such a quantum leap from valuation/last done to pay such a huge premium.....simply because they also have a huge premium portion which bank loans don't cover above valuation.

So sorry to hear that.  My basic expectations for an agent, especially if they do tenancy is that they need to at least make it hassle-free and worry-free for the landlord.
 
Anyway, for people who get referal from friends/relatives my suggestion is to do some basic check first on that agent :
 
- is he full time or part time? I am not saying part time agents are bad, but we know that time will always be limited for a part time agent (since he has another job elsewhere) so if the client value responsiveness, then he should go for a full time agent. Again, it doesn't mean full time agent will always be responsive, but at least you stack the odds in your favour.
- Thesedays there are many agent review portals. Check if that agent has good reviews with long comments written by client. Do not just look at number of reviews but mostly either no comments or very short comments. Clients often take time to write long good comments about the agent if he is good.
- If you are looking for an agent to sell a house, check out his listings in Propertyguru. If you could not find him in PG, then obviously he is not serious enough in his business to invest in the #1 search portal in SG.  If you could find him in PG, but he has like 40 listings there, then it is clear that he cannot be devoting that much time to your house. 
 
Use some of the pointers above for a referal agent. There is no perfect agent, but at least you may get one that aligns with your value.

you see some of these ads they are just stuck there for a few months never move also because the asking price so ridiculous. In the end you check URA and see the price sold it will be inline with the prices sold in the past.

That's why market transactions low.
 
CMs limit fund access of buyers.
 
Sellers not willing to transact at offered price (with the taxes wedged in for buyers). Why should they if they are having a good use for the property (rent or own stay) and price offers to offload are insufficient to compensate for them to let go?
 
That's exactly market distortion.

No recession, cooling measures and uncertain economy equals slow sales
So the agents and newspapers need to talk up sales and show crowded showrooms
However having said that Singaporeans have deep pockets and there are still many buyers
New couples still need homes
En bloc buyers
And hopeful investors keep the flames going

As long as still can cover instalments, no one will let go at lower price. The so-called recession has not even started. Current retrenchment level is really nothing. Those that let go at loss now must be the weakest ones to fall down. 
 
Similarly buyers looking for bargain are far too many because all thinking they got amber ammunition.

many not so serious sellers out there. 
 
When I do searching for my serious buyers, none of these units will be on my list. I don't want to waste my buyers and my time.
 
Good or fair valuation units can be found, but most consumers do not have the right tools to do the job. Most of the tools available to public can get you around the ballpark, but very tedious work.

https://sbr.com.sg/residential-property/news/chart-day-new-condo-sales-volume-could-jump-33-in-q2
 

new condo sales volume may climb 33% YoY to 2,300 units in Q2, as compared to 1,739 units in Q1.
 
It was led by new sales in the Rest of Central Region (RCR) area, rocketing 80% to more than 1,100 units. The report said that this was in line with the launch of five new projects in the region which accounted for more than 60% of the total new unit launches in Q2.
 
Last quarter, new condo sales volume edged up 2.3% as Core Central Region (CCR) recorded an 82% increase in volume. This is followed by the Outside Central Region (OCR) at 52.4% QoQ, whilst new sales volume in the Rest of Central Region (RCR) crashed 37.3% QoQ.

nowadays trend seem like people go for freehold rather than lh99
reason is simple, there is less fh than lh, and fh holds value better
 
the 2017 wake up call that hdb value falls to zero at 99th year also support this belief that lh99 does not hold value well, and hdb resale pricing has been falling for some time now
 
this symptom further spin off to affect pte lh99, now people holding older lh99 pte also worry they might face same outcome as hdb resale, especially if less ideal locations or not near mrt or amenities, and those lh99 over 30yr old, ie left less than 70yr tenure 
 
those lh99 in ideal locations should worry less, though enbloc appetite is now greatly reduced by the euphoric cooling measures
 
seemike fh is way to go now, especially if near town or near mrt and amenities

The end of lease issue is interesting..
For HDB the government has been trying to give some rather vague and weak assurances 
For those with LH properties in prime locations there may still be a chance for en bloc sales 
Now there’s a special bunch where the land is actually FH but the developer has chosen to sell it as a LH - the buyers will have no right to en bloc .. see The Shore in the Amber area for example..

It’s not just assurance. 
As HDB being highly subsidised is way underpriced to begin with, Govt is just working on recognising the actual value of older HDBs to shunt the fall.
 
Don’t forget that VERS will still be an eventual option 20 years down the road. There is further ground for value recognition.

It not entirely correct to say the flats are highly subsidised. Maybe only those BTO ones. Resale ones are very expensive. Those who bought in the last 5 years will suffer a loss if they sell it.

Those who bought in the last 5 years will suffer a loss if they sell it.Flats are highly subsidised because if allowed to be deployed for rental, the yield for any flat, any location bought as BTO is close to 10%. 
This informs that the underlying value is way higher than what one has paid for. Any good in a free market should not exceed 5% yield technically, and 5% is already considered a good performer in today’s market.
 
Even if one gets an old resale, the yield is also about 5%, closing in on actual market value. This gives a bit of leeway for Govt to play with.
 
If you rented for 30 years, you would have paid much more in rent than if you had bought.

Based on the principles of free market, it is highly subsidised.
 
Any similar offering in a comparable market that is close to free market condition, the price should actually be double of what it is now.
 
Any ceiling leak after several decades, HDB still forks half the cost of repair price.
 
Public housing, public transport, public food (hawker), public medical and public education. These essentials are subsidised in many ways.

i understand your drift about it being computed based on rental income......the thing is, if we don't put it out to rent, using this basis to term the hdb flat highly subsidised is somewhat a shove down the throat of the receiving party..........not comparable to private condo.  if anything, hdb resale doesn't strictly qualify to the word of "subsidised housing" since subsidy in plain english, means there is some sort of outright payment to reduce the cost of the item.
 
if they insist to use such line of comparison, where do we stop?  there are so many types of property in the market with differing rental yield.  we can't be branding those with high yield as all being subsidised.

haha that time someone actually estimated the cost of construction and questioned why the selling price is so much more than costs....
 
then MND or HDB have to explain that they are losing money after factoring in land cost.

The fact remains that there are those who can make use of the market rent. Also, market forces are way too strong to be overcome.
 
For example, if Duxton 4rm BTO flat is priced at 500K, the supply will run out in seconds, if not minutes. Where to build the supply required? 
 
Similarly, if an outskirt HDB is sold at cost (not including land price) at say 100K, the one who bought will receive future rental yields well in excess of 20% per annum, live with in-laws for example. No need to work loh for these people, and that's a huge future problem. We would also be inadvertently inviting more PRs worldwide to buy up such a cheap commodity.
 
This balancing game is really not easy. Every part affects another part (s).

I don't know if I'm around when these flats expire, but I really want to see what happens.. does the Government have what it takes to do the correct thing..They are already doing the right thing. VERS will kick in once the first batch of flats fall under 30 years’ lease. 
30 years is still a Super Long period and the lease will still be valuable, especially if the location is good.
 
What is the annual price of lease for a well located HDB? For a 4-rm flat, minimum worth 30-40K a year! Actual market price for 30 years (central HDB) is still 1 million, lots of room for Govt to play with. Pay half? Pay 1/3? No problem!
 
What’s to worry?

It makes more sense to retrofit the ageing blocks and offer the existing owners a new set of 30 years lease after the 99 years lease has expired.  Thereafter, the blocks can be demolished to make way for new developments.
 
An additional 30 years lease should placate owners who made the mistake of overpaying for their units about 5-10 years ago, while affording a cheaper re-sale house for those who value convenience and lower price quantum.  The terms and conditions must be very clearly spelled out to those who want to renew their 30 years lease or buy these re-sale units.
 
I foresee that as a HDB block ages towards less than 30 years lease, there will be more vacant units when the existing owners pass away.

For hdb flats built before the 80s, dont know if the workmanship is good to be around until 99 years or beyond? I still dont really like flats to get too old, the surrounding of the flat and many things would be in a bad condition.

Why not compensate them a few hundred thousand and sell them a new 30 year studio apartment for 100K (current price) or less?
 
Even if they overpaid, current regulations insist the house has to be fully paid with 20 year lease left (no CPF, no loan). So they will be sitting on a large unit that still can be sold (full cash buyer).
 
The main beneficiaries in your suggestion seems to be the second gen. Most importantly, it defeats the meaning of what is meant by 99LH.

I foresee that as a HDB block ages towards less than 30 years lease, there will be more vacant units when the existing owners pass away.

Why not compensate them a few hundred thousand and sell them a new 30 year studio apartment for 100K (current price) or less?
 
Even if they overpaid, current regulations insist the house has to be fully paid with 20 year lease left (no CPF, no loan). So they will be sitting on a large unit that still can be sold (full cash buyer).
 
The main beneficiaries in your suggestion seems to be the second gen. Most importantly, it defeats the meaning of what is meant by 99LH.

 
Indeed I'm looking at the 2nd or 3rd generation owners.  The 1st generation would have already passed away when the HDB reaches 99 years.
 
Essentially, it allows these owners to top up the lease.  VERS may not be feasible in many cases for these 2nd or 3rd generation owners.
 
What is happening now is owners of ageing HDB units are finding it harder to sell off their unit so I think HDB neighbourhood decay due to vacant units in ageing estates could be a real issue in the next 10 years.

Coming back to it being subsidised.
 
Why subsidise first generation (who paid for it eventually) and used it to fund retirement, and now to pay for the second generation? In fact, if it had been a new BTO flat, it could subsidise across 3 generations.
 
What about the new entrants to the job market (no HDB inheritance) looking for a decently sized flat while others inherit the HDB across generations, rent out, purchase private property, perhaps even balonglong, jiak kang kong?
 
Is the resource allocation equitable and reasonable?
 
For private property benchmarked closer to market value, inheritance is indeed part of the plan to begin with. But this inheritance component has never been written into HDB vision. Why should it ever be?
 
Every man, woman, or couple should be given the responsibility to work for his / her own home.
 
VERS indeed is a solution. Recycle it back  to the pool for re-allocation.

Ageing HDB units still can find buyer but the price would be low. Some popular area, even though the flat is old, i believe there will still be buyer. But if the location no good, then indeed hard to find buyer even at low price.

I have serious doubt about VERS as it only brings forward the 99 years lease and reimburses the balance lease.  The voting process and involvement of private developers are also controversial to me.

The voting process and involvement of private developers are also controversial to me.Don’t bring forward, then some (esp 2nd gen) will really live in it happily till the lease becomes zero. Housing them at that stage when they have no income and no collateral, no health, will be a huge issue for the future government. 
At the very least, the relocation process will make them think more seriously about the situation.

In my opinion, if hdb maintain its initial core mission of building cheap housing for the mass and cpf withdrawal remains at 55, the problem won't be so complicated.
 
Not a 100% sure got, but at least it won't complicate it.

Then we have to do case studies of what happened at Duxton and other central flats.
 
2006, HDB 5-room flat can be bought at Duxton for 300,000+.
 
Will supply meet demand? Or should we allow HDBs to be built only in the outskirts (non-central)?
 
Moreover, there are indeed BTOs that are still for the mass, but may require more travelling. Sembawang, Punggol, Yishun etc... Out of reach for the mass mah?
 
Then there is the issue of ageing population. These are real issues.
 
It's easy to criticise but the answers are always very complicated. Its always easier to point elsewhere and lament.

I don't know if I'm around when these flats expire, but I really want to see what happens.. does the Government have what it takes to do the correct thing..So what is the correct thing?  
Its already known that for 99LH, will revert to zero and back to ahgong.HDB main intention for own stay with a roof over head, not a money/profit making tool.
That said, 80% own only this and some may rely on this solely for retirement funding, and that is also why its a goood thing that over time, property price have to go UP to hedge inflation.
 
Or alternatively, flexibility is key. At least one HDB one PTE. So even if hdb unit left with 30 years, just rent out and stay pte, sure can cover hdb cost plus some more, won't lose money.

dont think only hdb affected
recently lh99 private, especially if outer core region without mrt and more than 20years, seem to be less popular compared to in the past
buyers now seem to think twice before buying a old lh99 resale, be it hdb or private
reason is the enbloc appetite of developers has shrunk since the last cooling measure in 2018
if this continues, the resale for lh99 private will be affected like the hdb
 
so even if own one hdb and one private, there is no guarantee of inflation hedge, if both are lh99
freehold on the other hand, is gaining popularity now

too early to talk about VERS now, we dont even know if the whole idea would be scrapped 10yr down the road?
actually the idea of lh99 drop to zero $ at 99th year is nothing new and nothing alarming
 
put it this way, if a 3room BTO cost $150k today, including 30yr loan at 2.6% interest of $66k, total paid is only $216k (aka 'hdb rental'), so even if the nett value drop to zero $ in 99years, the 'hdb rental' is $216k /99yr = $2.2k per yr, or $180 per month! even if you rent out 1 room at $500 per month, in 99 yr rental income of this 1 room is $594k, more than double the total amount paid for the 'hdb rental'
 
is VERS necessary? and where does HDB get the money for VERS? taxpayers' money?

just look at rental return for a hdb you will understand if hdb is heavily subsidised
eg if a $500k hdb and a $1mil pte lh99 both TOP same year and both value drop to zero at 99th year, both get same rental $2500 (nett of maintenance fee for pte lh99), the yield of the hdb is double of the pte
 
provided both drop to zero value at end-of-life, and no developers take up the enbloc
 
that's why developer enbloc appetite is very important for the survival of lh99 pte, otherwise resale demand will definitely drop for lh99 pte because of the rental yield and depreciation towards 99th year; now if VERS come into play, it is another competition for lh99 pte resale market
 
i think this is why there is now diminishing interests in old lh99 pte
 

Based on the principles of free market, it is highly subsidised.
 
Any similar offering in a comparable market that is close to free market condition, the price should actually be double of what it is now.
 
Any ceiling leak after several decades, HDB still forks half the cost of repair price.
 
Public housing, public transport, public food (hawker), public medical and public education. These essentials are subsidised in many ways.

Wah third thread, expected la...Property is at the heart of Singaporeans. We Love Property. hahahLand is still scarce in Singapore, only around 17% of land in Singapore is reserved for residential property. So thats why property prices in the long run are bound to run.In my opinion, right now is a good time to enter the market to look for good deals. Cooling measures, weak sentiment, poor demand...all this make developers gan jiong!Which makes buyers like us happy, we can source out quite good deals. I've doing my research and visited the showflats of various new launch condos. Being a property investor myself, im always hungry for good deals.
 
ive shortlisted to a few condos right now, based on good entry price, future growth potential and development of the area. Feel free to check them out and let me know your comments.

The Tre Ver 
Garden Residences Florence Residences Mayfair Modern Kent Ridge Hill 
So far my favourite has got to be Garden Residences, especially the blocks facing the landed view.

Crazy high prices....if purely just for enjoyment, then you might be able to justify if you have ALOT of spare cash.
 
Otherwise, there are so many other better buys in the market!

You are saying exactly what I said regarding subsidies. 
We differ on opinions regarding old LH99 private properties though.
 
Developer appetite is contingent on government actions. Government actions are based on the background agendas. One of the agenda is to ensure landscape renewal. However, this is not a priority at the moment.
 
Properties that cross a certain age will be earmarked for the process. 
 
Not sure how VERS affects private though. The market seems segregated to me. It is a process to settle those whose only asset is an ageing HDB.

Yeap, nobody is looking to sell at current prices and even impending rate cut.
 
Only got buyers, very few sellers (except developers).

pte developer appetite is depending on what's available in the land market and the existing policies on stamp duties  
but do note that reclaimed hdb land from VERS can be resold to pte developers for building new lh99 pte condo if the government so wish to, depending on the future policies 
 
hence the 2 markets may not be so segmented afterall
 
and if that happens, VERS will likely affect pte lh99 enbloc because now developers have more choices of land that were made available with VERS
 
i doubt government will utilize taypayers money for full VERS, they rather recoup from pte developers right?

Current enbloc works cos all the old development has untabbed potention in form of plot ratio. If this is already maximised out for new design developments, then potential largely limited liao for 99yr lease. Top up lease also not as much upside

Still segregated largely...
 
Govt is unlikely to pre-announce a specific site is going to be full private when they set it for VERS. If they do so, the HDB owners would ask for the moon. This has also not occurred for current SERS. Also, the specific use can also be adjusted later, more flexibility.
 
What could be done is to set aside a ratio of which proportion for new HDBs and which proportion for private or commercial, or mixed development, or even EC, in order to raise the land proceed to help VERS recipients receive increased payout.
 
Don't forget the Govt still needs to continue to build HDBs in the future so a huge proportion of land (say 70%) still needs to be reserved for new BTOs, maybe 10,000 annually.

Top up lease also not as much upsidenew pte condo, whether fh or lh99, nowadays squeeze every inch of gfa, in future it's difficult to entice enbloc unless plot ratio increase, subject to what's in the future ura master plan. of course between fh and lh99, fh is stillbmore attractive due to lesser fh land available in Singapore, and there is no need for developer to top up to reset the 99yr tenure 
in other words, it's getting less attractive for developer to buy lh99 land through enbloc unless priced competitively or if location is good eg atas location or near mrt and amenities 
 
if more Lh99 land from VERS is made available to pte developers for building condo, will developers still pay premium for pte enbloc? 
the VERS land will cost less compared to pte enbloc payout to owners which is often priced above market transacted prices, even if VERS is pegged to hdb transacted prices, a hdb resale is much lower than pte resale in the same area

hard to say but buying sentiment for old lh99 whether pte or hdb has been dropping consistently , the underlying reason should be the issue of property aging, depreciation to zero, and end up no enbloc takers or abundant supply of lh99 land available for pte developers who are currently not buying due to the high stamp duties, plus the need to top up to renew 99yr tenure  
on the other hand, freehold is comparatively becoming more attractive due to no aging issue, no top up required, no depletion to zero value, less abundant (or more scarce) , and is truly segregated from lh99 market, both pte and hdb alike

I understand what you mean. My FH valuation has been going up. Still quite new LH99 valuation also going up as long as is decently sized. 
FH focus swings to zero in on investment value but downplays the usage value such as yields or own stay. It is another way of looking at property.
 
Land will only get more costly next time no matter which angle I see it.

if talk about yield, then hdb win hands down no fight for fh or lh99 ptebut talk about hedging inflation and growth potential, fh win lh99
there is only so much fh that government will let go to pte sector, after all it want to continue to be the biggest landlord, for obvious reason, all lh99 finally return to the nation ownership 
so this little piece of fh pie is what make it so attractive to Singaporean and foreign investors, scarcity is what make it fun to play with
the 70% lh99 public is the backbone, hongkong made the mistake of breaking its backbone and oversold to pte sector, now they are unable to recoup these 'lost' land and pte sector control HK land and property price, Singapore will never go down this path given the hard lessons that HK learnt

It’s all in Govt hands. You can be FH but they want it they will take it back at market value (they say what value means what value).

They will compensate up to 99 years of lease plus minus only. This is my understanding based on Bala’s table.

Reasons why FH gaining popularity, high psf of new 99LH, can get resale FH.The other is due to last enbloc fever of FH projects, FH land is a thing of the past, all GLS is 99, if no enbloc where to find FH?
HDB/PTE different ball game, for PTE can enbloc top up lease to fresh 99. FH LH both got pro and con. Example FH not be in as good location as LH,next to mrt etc.
 
As mentioned prior, same principles apply can rent out either the hdb/pte 30 years cost more or less covered, still have 70 years to go 'FREE', which is a very loooooooong time. 
If concern of lease run down,can adopt appropriate approach at different stages of the 99 years.Example, sell within first 10-20 years.
 
Without enbloc, all future new launches to be only LH. For me, I won't be too duly concerned about it. High sell psf for new launches, I see more 'value' in resale, and those new 99 will eventually be older resale too. So even for old 20-30 years LH resales, may represent a 'value' buy whether own stay or rental capital appreciation investment.
Example, buying old resale own stay just put in 50-100k reno to 'brand new'. Buying for rental, lower cost pay less interest to bank higher yield etc.
 
Again, 99 years is a very long time can cover 2 generations. For the buyer, probably won't even have the chance to see lease running down to zero.

When Govt needs your FH property...
 
They will compensate up to 99 years of lease plus minus only. This is my understanding based on Balaâs table.
 how did you know how much government compensated these fh?? how did you know these owners only received lh99 price for their fh??

Well that was a fair price in 2012. Whether they had the holding power is a different thing. Of course a FH landed is a solid investment... but 3mil was pretty high back then

all the rich foreign investors feel Singapore property prices still consider cheap compare to counterparts in Asia eg HK shenzhen Shanghai, etcthe thing that make Singapore appear expensive is actually cars, not properties 
if you include hdb prices in the index, we are not that expensive. if you look at pte at d9, 10,11 of course over $3000psf is expensive
if you look at the most expensive hdb resale at boonkeng, is not even 1k psf
bto lagi cheap! 
only that foreign investors do not include hdb  in their calculation because they not eligible to buy hdb 
2.5 mil for a 2100 sq ft terrace is a good price in 2012nowadays fh 2100sqf land easily 3m+

Marymount Residents Upset Over NSE
 
https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/property-management-news/2012/2/42348/marymount-residents-upset-over-nse-payout-appeal
this example is not about fh sold at lh99 pricing la 
is about government offer the Marymount owners recent 2012 market transactions pricing but the owners bankers value their property 20% above the recent transaction pricing
 
in other word, these Marymount owners' neighbors could have sold their houses 2012 at below valuation pricing, or the bankers could have overvalued the properties 
 
nevertheless today market 2100sqf fh landed easily 3.3m+ depend on any new renovation, so lets say 2.6m to 3.3m is 700k diff over 7yr, ie 100k per yr appreciation, ie 3.5% annualized 
 
so base on such a appreciation rate, the 2.6m offer in 2012 was considered a very good price
though human being greedy in nature, wanted 2019 pricing in 2012

the examples in your table is all lh99 not fh leh
you got mistaken la
how can our government compensated fh owners at lh99 price
The examples in Bala’s table are all computed based on land value as a proportion of FH value. 
So a LH with 99 years left will have 96% value of FH land.
 
That means even if you paid 20% more to secure the FH land, when Govt pays for your land, the most you can expect them to pay is fresh 99LH plus 4%.
 
FH is still tagged to LH values.
 
If you read the table carefully, you will also realise that LH with 60 years lease left still has 80% land value as freehold.
 
Therefore if someone chose a new 99LH, by saving up 20% costs at time of purchase upfront, he will get 20% less at the time of compensation some 40 years down the road.
 
Voluntary enbloc, indeed can fight for 10-20% premium with Developers. But when compulsorily acquired, the premium for land is at most 4% over a comparable site GLS offering.

Is just examples using lh99, nothing to do with fhespecially now lh99 and fh gap widen further and further, no sense to peg one to another 
they are different mkt segments
like durian vs apple
in reality fh compensation is pegged to recent fh transaction prices in the vicinity plus a premium gratuity
fh is not benchmark against lh99 value 
how can compare durian to apple? the taste also different
fh compensation don't work the same as lh99

wow...can buy GCB, there must be a good reason why people choose to buy Singapore property and not Johor ð¤£ð¤£ð¤£ð¤£

You can always choose to throw all caution to the wind if you wish and believe what you choose to believe.
 
Another component that Govt may pay is your infrastructure (age, base value of building for example). This is regardless of the lease value.
 
This is not enbloc. There is a reason why it is termed compulsory acquisition.

caution is good only if there is a real danger, problem is, people who complain compensation too low is it really too low or isit out of greed and want to peg the valuation to future value??  
eg the Marymount case in 2012, 2100sqf fh land at 2.6m was considered very good price that time yet those owners kpkb say should get 3mil+ instead
 
today a 2100sqf that area is only about 3mil+ only if renovation done recently, old house no reno can't even hit 3mil

Correction: 2012 market was almost at peak (just before peak 2013).
 
900sf of FH land (I was looking) cost about 1.5million then.
 
I think such a property sold on open market would sell for 3million already when it was acquired.
 
 
this example is not about fh sold at lh99 pricing lais about government offer the Marymount owners recent 2012 market transactions pricing but the owners bankers value their property 20% above the recent transaction pricingin other word, these Marymount owners' neighbors could have sold their houses 2012 at below valuation pricing, or the bankers could have overvalued the propertiesnevertheless today market 2100sqf fh landed easily 3.3m+ depend on any new renovation, so lets say 2.6m to 3.3m is 700k diff over 7yr, ie 100k per yr appreciation, ie 3.5% annualizedso base on such a appreciation rate, the 2.6m offer in 2012 was considered a very good pricethough human being greedy in nature, wanted 2019 pricing in 2012

I did buy a new FH at LH pricing later on. But in general, the lease is factored into the pricing for most developments.
but what about now the gap between lh99 and fh keep widening? is it a sign of fear of lh99 going to zero value in 99th year and no enbloc takers 
take note vers if happen in future may lead to increase in land supply of lh99 to both hdb and pte condo, such vers land may not be cheap but definitely cheaper than the enbloc fever kind of pricing
 
in fact developers may not want to buy enbloc pte lh99 or may buy only if price is low, compared to vers land
 
by then, fh become even more scarce in comparison, hence may lead to more developer wanting to pay premium price for fh enbloc

TORONTO (BLOOMBERG) - As protests continue to rock Hong Kong, real estate brokers in Canada and the UK are fielding a flood of inquiries from investors in the former British colony who are eager to get out.
Mr Dan Scarrow, president of Macdonald Real Estate Group in Vancouver, said many of his Chinese agents saw an uptick in interest for both sales and rentals this month from Hong Kong. One of his agents is putting off her planned retirement this year to capitalise on the opportunity.
Before, it was usually a ratio of five mainland Chinese to one Hong Kong buyer coming to open houses, he said.
"It has completely flipped now," said Mr Scarrow. "Whether or not that actually translates into deals, that comes down to what continues to happen in Hong Kong."
People have begun scouting for properties in cities, including Toronto, Vancouver and London, as the unease surrounding Hong Kong's political future grows amid China's increasing influence. A drop in residential property prices is making some of these cities attractive.
"Hong Kong money could become a major source of capital," said Mr David Ho, a broker at CBRE who deals with Asian investments. "People are shocked, given that Hong Kong was always branded as a stable, rule-of-law financial hub, and now want to move their capital to other cities to mitigate the risk and also to look for other homes."
 
 
A look at few of the markets that are of interest to the Hong Kong buyers: Vancouver's Advantage Vancouver, where housing prices have been in a slump for the past year, may be the first city to benefit from the upheaval in Hong Kong.
 
Changes in Vancouver tax laws have pushed property prices lower since 2018, Knight Frank said in a report, adding that investors will also benefit from currency-adjusted discounts of 17 per cent over the last year.

Actually it seems everywhere else including Singapore is soaking in the demand.  
For many, they are readying the move if things turn further south.
 
They may not all stay in Asia, but a good proportion would. And it they do, Singapore will be amongst their TOP choices.

Language, variety of Asian food, similar climate, safety and proximity to hk would be what I would feel are some reasons they would prefer sg. 
We will know in the coming months if many are shifting here. Just look at how some HK stars have already recently settled here.

1 out of 10 coming to us will be too much for us. 
1 out of 100 also too many.
 
1 out of 1000 per year will be ok for us in all aspects.
 
Needs about 7000 units per year over next few years to cope.
 
But the biggest problem is that if Chinese slow or stop investing in HK and some attention is diverted here... really don’t dare to go into those Math.

Most important is what you are buying for, which affects the size you should be getting. 
Almost like asking, what vehicle should I buy? I only interested in XXX brand.

Something that is 10-15 years old?
 
If die die must be new then it’s tough. 20% appreciation maybe in more than 10 years, would you be ok with that?

Cannot compare BTO price with developer price. 
BTO price is confirmed lower than resale.
 
Developer price is typically always higher than resale. Must be able to tolerate the first few years of fake low before actually rising above.

I keep telling people to watch the supply wall, and that CM effects would not last beyond a couple of quarters. 
 
It’s obvious but I really don’t see why this is “unexpected”.
Yup, just have to ask why enbloc fever with developers paying huge premiums, when there's no change in CMs. 
To meet pent-up demand to PTE, even more so now with more upgraders/enblockers/foreign and selling at high psf.
 
May see anothe round enbloc fever in few years, when current supply is absorbed to a low level.

7-8 years ago Punggol private condos were only selling around $800+ psf and sales were only so-so during launch.  It took the developers about 3 years to clear the units totally.
 
To afford $1,000+ psf for an EC means that the buyers must be mostly HDB up-graders in that area.
 
My estimates for the upcoming ECs will all be above $1,000 psf:
Anchorvale Crescent EC in Q1 2020 (10 min walk to MRT)
Canberra Link EC Q1 2020 (10 min walk to MRT)
Tampines Ave 10 EC Q3 2020 (cannot walk to MRT)

Better don't complain about the traffic there so much. Later when GPS erp starts next year, they label the entire punggol area as chargeable area.

when the aging population got issue in getting by, there is always AirBnB to unleased the burden.
 
So buy now is a great idea if you can afford it. Else have to give it a miss for those looking at the 3rd or 4th property.
 
CPI was tag at 1.2%.
 
Tech recession is on the horizon.
 
Should have quite a few bargain units in time to come.

The moment Govt announce monetary easing to curb recession, you can expect almost immediate asset price rise. 
The current supply is far from matching the demand that continues to soak in from global situations.
 
You will be really very blessed to find any bargain in the year ahead.

There are some older suburb condos going for $1.1 to $1.2k n in better location as well n more spacious but admittedly near 20 yrs at least. The older condos give good value compared to these new ones but i Guess most buyers want a new condo n so willing to pay for it.

With EC at these prices, city fringe condos at 1900 psf, the gap has really narrowed bettween those in CCR and out skirt. I feel those in CCR is really undervalued...
 
But I guess the issue is quantum. Not many people can afford above 1.5m. 
 
I was doing so research and noticed in other cities the gap between outskirts and those in city centre the price gap is usually 3-4 times. 
 
These past ten years OCR and RCR has risen so much while ccr stagnant, dunno if this trend will continue

Tampines Ave 10 EC Q3 2020 (cannot walk to MRT)
7-8 years ago, I was looking at this Punggol Watertown, can get a unit there slightly below 1k psf during preview launch and this is private condo with full amenities at doorstep.The subsequent phases were selling 1.3-1.4k psf and still sold like hotcakes, I was like ...??? for Punggol??? 
Today, we are seeing EC at near private condo psf.
 
Not necessarily, could be HDB upgraders, or also some rich folks buying for children, no ABSD 
 
Anyway, mentioned many times ... ' SG property, always good to be in as early as possible' 

That's just a glimpse of what's to come next in terms of property prices ...
 
-HDB already cross 1mil mark
-EC gonna breach 1k psf next
-new 99LH avg 1.5k psf, FH no 2k psf no talk
 
Those still not in the game ... just gonna get left behind with prices out of reach

Thats very surprising. I always have the belief that BTO flats is 100% sure made $$ one.
What makes you say there is little gain?
This means they are over priced vs private. Depreciating public goods using private pricing mechanism.

Will Singapore have riots like Hong Kong 10 years down the road when private properties are way beyond the reach of the young working class except those with rich parents?Unlike HK, there are other cheaper options like bto and resale HDB for those that find private ex. 
Private property is a want, not a need. One doesn't have to buy a Merc for their first car I guess. If cannot buy Merc must riot?

Cannot compare BTO price with developer price.
 
BTO price is confirmed lower than resale.
 
Developer price is typically always higher than resale. Must be able to tolerate the first few years of fake low before actually rising above.
u r mistaken, my post is not comparing bto vs pte developer prices, rather, is showing that some prime bto got tremendous profits after mop of 5yr, which even most pte properties cannot match

Wow.. unbelievable. Average 1080psf for this type of ulu location1k psf is now the new norm for ulu location EC lh99, which is the stepping stone to low end mass market pte segment priced around 1300psf
7-8 years ago Punggol private condos were only selling around $800+ psf and sales were only so-so during launch.  It took the developers about 3 years to clear the units totally.
 
To afford $1,000+ psf for an EC means that the buyers must be mostly HDB up-graders in that area.
 
My estimates for the upcoming ECs will all be above $1,000 psf:
Anchorvale Crescent EC in Q1 2020 (10 min walk to MRT)
Canberra Link EC Q1 2020 (10 min walk to MRT)
Tampines Ave 10 EC Q3 2020 (cannot walk to MRT)
yes, 1k+ psf is now the new norm for entry level lh99 EC at lousy locations it used to be 800psf for EC in better locations, but those days are gone now

by 2030 simi Punggol Yishun Tengah is as good as Orchard la ... act now  ... MTL
just take it as inflation cost 2-3% up forever ever lo
but in reality property price jump is 2-3x of inflation cost
which normal salary man and woman can never catch up!
2 to 3x only true for selected pte properties only, eg fh or near town near mrt or atas location hdb resale still flat after so many years 
some less ideal location pte properties or those bought during peak prices also not making much or even sold at losses

The moment Govt announce monetary easing to curb recession, you can expect almost immediate asset price rise.
 
The current supply is far from matching the demand that continues to soak in from global situations.
 
You will be really very blessed to find any bargain in the year ahead.
Cost-based calculation. 
 
From the land price and construction costs, it was apparent from the point of bidding.
is a seller market now, especially fh properties, as sellers now very resilient because strong holding powers and no sight of interest rate hikesmost asking for future prices now, ie 10-20% above value
all waiting for price to shoot up further as value of money drop further due to continual inflation

With EC at these prices, city fringe condos at 1900 psf, the gap has really narrowed bettween those in CCR and out skirt. I feel those in CCR is really undervalued...
 
But I guess the issue is quantum. Not many people can afford above 1.5m. 
 
I was doing so research and noticed in other cities the gap between outskirts and those in city centre the price gap is usually 3-4 times. 
 
These past ten years OCR and RCR has risen so much while ccr stagnant, dunno if this trend will continue
1.5m quantum?? even boonkeng hdb resale 1.2m alreadydon't under estimate Singaporeans warchests
each one is crouching tiger hidden dragon hor
 
but I agree with you ccr and rcr prices only about 2x of ocr, this is simply because Singapore is too small! and too well connected by mrt and busses, our whole Singapore is like the size of a ccr of other countries, and these countries rcr and ocr are really far from amenities, hence price also much cheaper 

Unlike HK, there are other cheaper options like bto and resale HDB for those that find private ex.

What makes you say there is little gain?

 
Punggol and SengKang, the two most popular BTO areas have 132 units that are going to MOP within the next 1 month.
 
Out of these 132 units, only 16 units are in the black based on market valuation.
 
And out of that 16 units that probably make money, only 2 units could be between 10%-20% profit. The other 14 units are all below 10% profit.
 
But note that 116 units are all under water.

You will be lucky if you buy any BTO now and get 20% in 10 years!
 
Many who bought BTO after 2013 did not see much or even any gains after their MOP
due to enlightenment in 2017 about lh99 drop to zero value in 99th year hence people not so keen in old lh99 nowadays be it hdb or pte 
people tend to prefer new lh99 or fh now

Actually i kind of understand the feeling of these hdb upgraders.
 
The HDB resale seems to be going south while the private is going higher. That is why they are willing to sell at a loss now so they can upgrade to private ASAP. They are worried that every year they delay, the gap is just going to get bigger. 
 
That is why I always thing HDB prices should be benchmarked to private resale and the government has to keep private property prices in checked. This allows citizens to achieve their dream of owning a private property.

It is not a must and/or every citizen's right to be upgraded to private housing.
 
In many cases, it's because they booked a private first then intend to sell off HDB when TOP, and they have to do within half a year so as to qualify for remission of ABSD.
 
Loss also sell, if not they pay for the loss with ABSD. Some in the end chose to keep both and chose to forgo ABSD remission instead.

Why does anyone owe citizens a dream of owning a private property?
 
HDB should be kept affordable. BTOs should not be pegged to resale HDBs. As long as BTOs are kept affordable, resale HDBs will not be too expensive and this will also put a lid on PP prices.

depend 
if atas location, good facing good view, high floor, near mrt , near town near amenities, then price is UP UP UP
eg high floors at dbss boon keng, pinnacle duxton , peak tpy, etc
 
sadly most of hdbs do not fulfill above criteria hence overall hdb resale trend now is downwards, especially those old ones more than 30yr and lousy locations or poor facing

wah...no private condo means no achievement and no dream
 
 

 
pte condo alot of cheap affordable ones, eg those in the range $1100 to $1400psf are consider mass market pte condo
guideline quantum for these units about ~$1.5mil for 3room (~1000 to 1200sqf)
this range is consider stepping stone for hdb upgraders due to the affordable quantum for a $9,500 median household income and tdsr 60%, meaning for a median income family, max loan is $5700pm including all debts (house, car, personal loan, credit card loan, etc)
 
above this is mid range, $1400psf to $1800psf
 
go higher is mid-high , around $1900psf to $2400psf, quantum about ~$2mil for a 1000 to 1200sqf unit
 
go even higher is high range $2500psf to $3000psf
 
luxury range is above $3000psf, eg the dyson 21000sqf penthouse is 73mil, ie $3450psf

not many people willing to pay ABSD to keep the hdb
2nd property absd for local is now 12% leh
say if the hdb worth 400k in resale market and the pte property bought at 1mil, is it worth to pay the 12% absd which is 120k to keep the 400k hdb?
120k is 30% of 400k !
 
of course if nobody buy the hdb also no choice have to keep

in as early as possible for fh or new lh99 is ok la, if in as early as possible for a old lh99 hdb or pte which no enbloc taker or no resale potential and depreciation to zero at 99th year also sad storyAs mentioned prior, no one size fits all, diff folks diff requirements.Today, whether buying for own stay/rental yield/capital appreciation, I would pick a old resale LH over new launch 99lh.
 
-New units new lease 99, but then you are also paying for it at high psf.
-Old units less lease years, you also pay less psf/overall quantum.
 
'Go resale for better value'
 
 

EC is special breed, not anyone eligible. For those who want brand new condo, even at record sale psf, still the lowest around compared to private.
 
Personally if buying, I won't even bother with new launches today. High selling psf for new LH, can get resale FH.
Above 1k psf for new EC, can get resale private condo in a better location near to mrt...etc 
'Go resale for better value' 
 
That said, diff strokes diff folks. Just like some willing to pay record price for resale HDB 
 
https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/resale-record-set-dbss-unit-053000714.html
New resale record set by DBSS unit at City View @ Boon Keng


Reasons why FH gaining popularity, high psf of new 99LH, can get resale FH.
The other is due to last enbloc fever of FH projects, FH land is a thing of the past, all GLS is 99, if no enbloc where to find FH?
HDB/PTE different ball game, for PTE can enbloc top up lease to fresh 99. FH LH both got pro and con. Example FH not be in as good location as LH,next to mrt etc.
 
As mentioned prior, same principles apply can rent out either the hdb/pte 30 years cost more or less covered, still have 70 years to go 'FREE', which is a very loooooooong time. 
If concern of lease run down,can adopt appropriate approach at different stages of the 99 years.Example, sell within first 10-20 years.
 
Without enbloc, all future new launches to be only LH. For me, I won't be too duly concerned about it. High sell psf for new launches, I see more 'value' in resale, and those new 99 will eventually be older resale too. So even for old 20-30 years LH resales, may represent a 'value' buy whether own stay or rental capital appreciation investment.
Example, buying old resale own stay just put in 50-100k reno to 'brand new'. Buying for rental, lower cost pay less interest to bank higher yield etc.
 
Again, 99 years is a very long time can cover 2 generations. For the buyer, probably won't even have the chance to see lease running down to zero.

1.5m quantum seem like the norm now for a entry level mass market lh99 pte condo 3br
eg if the 3br unit is 1100sqf , 1.5mil means its $1400psf
 
notwithstanding, even ulu location EC direct from hdb now already hit $1080psf !!
 
btw i guess mass mkt quantum is always pegged to median household income
 
currently median h/h income is about $9500per mth, so if tdsr is 60%, means total debt payable per month for this household is $5700
say a household buy a 1.5mil pte condo down 20%, borrow 80% for 25yr at 2.6% interest, the bank loan is 1.2mil, monthly payment to bank is $5400

1.5mil is now the new norm for entry level lh99 pte condo
even with current 12% absd, pte property still moving robust
suspect these buyers are enbloc gainers who received windfall from developers
and likely they are not paying 12% absd, meaning husband buy 1 , wife buy 1
 
if absd is reduced from 12% back to 7%, the resulting shoot up in demand will be very significant

Why does anyone owe citizens a dream of owning a private property?
 
HDB should be kept affordable. BTOs should not be pegged to resale HDBs. As long as BTOs are kept affordable, resale HDBs will not be too expensive and this will also put a lid on PP prices.

 
this is what is happening now, BTO is no longer pegged to resale. HDB is falling. Is private property falling?
 
nobody owes anybody anything. The fundamental job of the government is to keep the people happy. If enough people wants to upgrade to private property, a smart government will listen to the people wishes and not make it out of reach. simple as that.

the current ABSD scheme actually enables a very warped logic that if you buy Two property, one wife one husband, you siam ABSD and makes it look like a good deal.....

old pte lh99 in lousy locations may be falling
but new LH99 and FH in good locations are going up
shows that buyers are now selective of choice properties that can hedge against inflation

By 2030 LTA masterplan say 80% of household will be within 10 mins walk to a mrt station... I estimate 10 mins to be about 600m..
 
If 8 in 10 have this access it means that 
 
1. If you are not within 600m your apartment / condo is considered very inconvenient 
 
2. If you are within 600m u are just one of the 80%
 
3. If you are within 300m and 5 mins walk the apartment is considered desirable
 
4. If within 200m and 3 mins walk then super super hot!
 
5. If within 200-300m and there is a mall there as well and FH!!! This is the ultimate already must keep long long

due to enlightenment in 2017 about lh99 drop to zero value in 99th year hence people not so keen in old lh99 nowadays be it hdb or pte
 
people tend to prefer new lh99 or fh now
116 bought direct from government at so high prices????
omg

 
Sorry.....I may have made it a little confusing, my bad.
 
116 includes resale. 132  units will MOP within next 1 month, but that includes resale units.
 
I did not bother to go into how many BTO and how many resale because the number of the units under water are already a big majority.

5 min walk? You need to be within 200-300m... we should take a 50-60 yr old man walking leisurely..

but new LH99 and FH in good locations are going up
shows that buyers are now selective of choice properties that can hedge against inflation

If inflation is at 3% p.a, effectively a $1m LH99 property today needs to sell out at $1.8m 20 years later (with 78 yrs lease remaining) just to match.
 
Anything less than 30% capital appreciation 20 years later (based on 50% upfront, BSD, ABSD, conveyances, today's gross rental yield 3%, 2% loan,5k per year property-related expenses), one would be in no better off than just to put the current cash upfront in a relatively do-nothing risk-free type of 1.8% return (SSB, ETFs, term insurance etc). There are so many variables that can swing the equation for property ownership vs just 1 for the fixed income investment.
 
Not saying dun buy or disputing property uptrend but one got to do the sums. Not a sure win for just any purchase which is already mentioned by many here.

1.5m quantum seem like the norm now for a entry level mass market lh99 pte condo 3br
eg if the 3br unit is 1100sqf , 1.5mil means its $1400psf
 
notwithstanding, even ulu location EC direct from hdb now already hit $1080psf !!
 
btw i guess mass mkt quantum is always pegged to median household income
 
currently median h/h income is about $9500per mth, so if tdsr is 60%, means total debt payable per month for this household is $5700
say a household buy a 1.5mil pte condo down 20%, borrow 80% for 25yr at 2.6% interest, the bank loan is 1.2mil, monthly payment to bank is $5400
wah if this is called good debt, having cash must be super evil

Need to have some context. Doesn't mean any unit within 3 mins walk to MRT is super duper hot. 
Gimme a unit that's 1 min walk to an ulu place like Joo Koon MRT.. or Tengah for example.. I say thanks but no thanks.
 
I'll take a unit in OCR anytime. Not near MRT? There's always feeder buses.

Nowadays where got down 20%? 
Govt says down 25% minimum.
 
Later if property run continues unabated, down 30% on the way..

not many people willing to pay ABSD to keep the hdb
2nd property absd for local is now 12% leh
say if the hdb worth 400k in resale market and the pte property bought at 1mil, is it worth to pay the 12% absd which is 120k to keep the 400k hdb?
120k is 30% of 400k !
 
of course if nobody buy the hdb also no choice have to keep
Outskirts HDB will take 6 years to recoup in rent. 
Near central HDB will take 4 years perhaps.

"His clients - mostly families with one or two children - often came with a budget of between S$5 million and S$20 million, and opted for listings in prime residential areas such as Singapore's shopping district, Orchard Road.
The latest government figures show Singapore's private home prices are on the rise, but even for those with smaller budgets and despite the additional buyers' stamp duty, homes there are still more affordable than in Hong Kong.
A 2018 report by property site 99.co revealed that a buyer with S$2 million could afford a 1,000 sq ft flat at Cairnhill Circle, located near Orchard. But the same amount could only buy a 448 sq ft flat in Hong Kong's Kennedy Town.
Added Chandran: "There is also a strong sense of safety and security due to the tight rule of law, and there is more stability here."
Other factors such as the low crime rate and absence of natural disasters were a draw for George Chan, a Hongkonger who relocated to Singapore last year with his wife and their two-year-old son."
Just as we were once the birds in Oz (cheap cheap), now they are the new birds in SG..

If it goes into a glut, the extent of risk exposure would be unthinkable. Having say that, JB forest City still going strong, so not sure why have not gone belly up.
 
HDB is a similar mechanism like sub prime but at a smaller quantum.
 
HDB does not rule you out if your earnings to upkeep the loan of 30 years is questionable.

agree, is not about making people happyit's about making people envy, so that there is motivation to move up the ladder
imagine 80% live in public and only 20% private 
 
isn't it a case of 80% envy 20% and want to move into pte to be part of the 20%
 
to facilitate such ladder climbing, the EC was invented to bridge the gap between hdb and low end lh99 pte condo
but nowadays EC also asking exorbitant price liao
seem like 1mil resale hdbs are encouraging rising EC prices, which in turn help to drive up low end pte condo, which in turn drive up rest of the private market 
is a vicious cycle lah
only thing is where are you currently in this whole pyramid, are you at the bottom layer, mid level or apex?

Punggol and SengKang, the two most popular BTO areas have 132 units that are going to MOP within the next 1 month.
 
Out of these 132 units, only 16 units are in the black based on market valuation.
 
And out of that 16 units that probably make money, only 2 units could be between 10%-20% profit. The other 14 units are all below 10% profit.
 
But note that 116 units are all under water.
 
That's new BTO for you.

 
This is bad. If this is the case, how to upgrade. In the past, people can make some nice decent $ to upgrade. Now i think no chance liao.

launches have become far and few between. The dbss scheme ended before we know it. Not sure how long this scheme will stay relevant if it only benefits a small percentage of the population.

reason is probably with resale hdb prices of the selected few pushing 1.2mil boundary, EC seem to be no choice but 'forced' to push up accordingly
 
in other words is a viscous cycle, people don't want to be the ones left behind at the base of the pyramid, everyone strive to go up higher, higher

truth is every year there are people curse and swear of missing the boat, and hope next downturn can bring prices down, low enough so that they can enter the market with their affordability base on ownself income level 
 
however the harder truth is this, the boat ticket prices just keep getting higher each year, and the income gap keep widening, and if your income cannot match the tdsr limit, you simply can't afford to enter the market with the high barrier, unless got huge warchests full of hard cash to down-payment
 
plus the hdb resale price not going up fast enough to catch up the pte properties prices, need to top up even more cash if want to make the jump
 
another problem is older lh99 pte with lousy locations also weak in resale, hard for these owners to upgrade to better location or fh
 
thus more and more frustrations on the ground nowadays in the mass market, the ball game is now in the luxury segment. recently quite a lot of vibrance in high end segment 
 
we need fresh funds from overseas investors to come in and create euphoria to spice up market, especially in the mid high to high end market. hopefully the funds can spiral down to mid and mass market if the sellers choose to encash and downgrade for retirement

nobody like to be left behind at bottom of pyramid, everyone aim to upgrade to next higher level 
at the apex of course is fh landed, see Dyson buy a fh gcb after bought lh99 penthouse, must be kena f by the financial advisors why buy lh99 instead of fh, then he quickly buy a fh to rectify buyer remorse

I Guess it's a common perception that EC is "subsidised private housing" and therefore sell after MOP sure make money?
 
That's why people rush to buy.
true, but the ulu location and the 1080psf price tag is a disparity that made me scratch my head 
then I recall punggol is the Guinea pig town for digitalisation and smart Nation 
 
then i recall further the promise of ' punggol 21' vision in 1996
 
hor hor it's finally coming, after over 20yr wait

Singapore property always good to be in the game, being vested.
 
The old days of buying new hdb, stay 5 yrs, sell and buy another new hdb and finally sell and buy new EC days are quite gone. That was almost a sure win way to make monies.
 
The same can't be said for now. Really dependa on all stars alignment. 
 
Having said that, I would advocate not overstretching finances and buy within means. Piece of mind over perceived sense of having arrived by staying in a private property.

ECs seem to be an out-dated concept.  I will not consider a family that can afford a $1 mil 3-bedroom EC as being a sandwiched class.  The government should re-direct the subsidies to more needy families.
 
Paper subsidy la.
 
Give you 30k to buy EC which pushes EC prices up which pushes the price developers pay for land up.

If the house bought new is subsidized, if sell after MOP confirmed can make money whether it is BTO or EC.
 
Diferent.
 
BTO after 5 years or 10 years, can only sell back to locals or long term PRs 
 
EC, after 5 years can sell to locals or any PR. After 10 years can even sell to foreigners.
 
The market size (hence market demand)  for EC expands  after 5 years and grow even larger after 10 years.

bto forever stuck as public status only hope is vers, but government said clearly not applicable to all and payout not as good as sers

https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/resale-unit-regency-park-reaps-165-mil-profit
Resale unit at Regency Park reaps $1.65 mil profit
 

The 1,959 sq ft unit on the second floor was bought for $1.6 million ($817 psf) in October 2006, and sold for $3.28 million ($1,674 psf) on July 15. The seller made a 105% profit, or an annualised profit of 6% over nearly 13 years.
 
The second top gain made over the week – a 59% profit of $1.65 million – was at Regency Park, located on Nathan Road in prime District 10. The 2,250 sq ft unit on the fourth floor was purchased for $2.78 million ($1,236 psf) in November 2006 and sold for $4.425 million ($1,967 psf) on July 12. 
 
At Dakota Residences, the seller of a penthouse unit made the third most profitable transaction of $1.58 million over the week. The 2,605 sq ft, four-bedroom unit on the 19th floor was bought for $2.62 million ($1,005 psf) in July 2008 when it was newly launched, and sold for $4.2 million ($1,612 psf) on July 12. The seller made a 60% profit, or an annualised profit of 4% over 11 years.
 
 
On the other hand, the greatest loss incurred over the week was from the resale of a 2,390 sq ft unit at 8 Bassein, on Bassein Road in prime District 11. The seller sold the property for $2.55 million ($1,067 psf) on July 12, and sustained a 13% loss of $388,000. The unit was purchased in May 2012 for $2.938 million ($1,229 psf). Over a holding period of seven years, this translates into an annualised loss of 2%.

Depending you bought when.
 
 I show a chart below on Avg $PSF gain for ALL HDB vs AL EC
 
Since 2013, HDB resale till now is -11% in prices. EC is +10% from 2013 till now.
 
If we look at the last 10 years, EC gain is double the appreciation rate compare to HDB.

HDB resale will be a lot higher if the rule that prevents private property owner from buying HDB is removed. This could help the glut of ageing HDBs in future.

The ECs sold in 2013 are in different locations than the ECs sold today.
 
Without adjusting for that, the 10% is meaningless.

There comes a time when all CMs are no longer effective and yet new CMs can no longer be added.
 
Too cheap will cause all private to be sold out to foreigners at low price. Who benefits in the end?
 
In any case, a HDB stake grants the owner a bigger piece of stake in our country as compared to private (for the same amount of funds committed). As long as Govt gets this part correct, we will not encounter what we see in HK.

Doesn't quite matter where the new ECs are today,  they will always remain popular as a form of subsidize housing.
 
A decade or two ago, who would think that places like Punggol or SengKang would ever make money?  The first round of BTO owners there already made their pot of gold.

I think the government needs to reign in the prices. U think the unrest in Hong Kong is about the extradition bill? 
 
I think it’s just the younger generation getting fed up with their standard of living caused by high property prices.... 
 
Singapore must not go down that route.
 
I mean years ago people here is always quoting Hong Kong as example of how high the prices can go....
 
In Singapore we are really alone. If people gets fed up enough to protest, say bye bye to Singapore prosperity.

Why should Govt rein in prices further just for foreigners to buy?What has been done and continues to be done is that HDB bedrock must remain accessible to 95% of population. There is a home for everyone, 30 sqm or 40 sqm notwithstanding. Remaining 5-10%, rental flats will ensure they have a place to stay.Why lower prices further for big conglomerate bosses to come here and sweep up everything?

Or why should lower prices more for the super rich to pay in full cash? A run up is healthy and really way overdue to even the game a little.

New tactics to avoid ABSD:
https://www.straitstimes.com/business/property/singapore-rich-kids-are-ending-up-with-penthouses-as-parents-skirt-taxes?cx_testId=20&cx_testVariant=cx_1&cx_artPos=2#cxrecs_s
 
Only works if they are old enough to buy...
 
 

 
Data is scant but property agents say they have seen a noticeable up-tick in apartments being bought by wealthy families for their children since the property cooling measures came into effect in July 2018. Additional buyer's stamp duty, or ABSD, is now levied at 12 per cent for second homes and 15 per cent for third and subsequent properties.
"Anecdotally we've observed more young home buyers entering the market," said Ms Christine Sun, the head of research and consultancy at OrangeTee & Tie. She said while first-time homebuyers who are not affected by ABSD dominate, many Singaporeans see the value of accumulating property as a store of wealth.	LUXURY SALESPrices are going in their favour, too. Data released last week from the Urban Redevelopment Authority showed private residential prices rose for the first time since the housing curbs were introduced. Dwelling values jumped 1.5 per cent in the three months through June 30, spurred by luxury apartment sales.
It's often the parents taking the lead on the house hunting.
 
 
"The high ABSD rate has induced parents to act vicariously, using their children's names to acquire another private residential property," said Mr Alan Cheong, the executive director of research and consultancy at Savills (Singapore). "(Parents are) either genuinely concerned that their children won't have the wherewithal to acquire private residential properties on their own, or using the first reason as an excuse to acquire properties for themselves."

Actually i kind of understand the feeling of these hdb upgraders.
 
The HDB resale seems to be going south while the private is going higher. That is why they are willing to sell at a loss now so they can upgrade to private ASAP. They are worried that every year they delay, the gap is just going to get bigger. 
 
That is why I always thing HDB prices should be benchmarked to private resale and the government has to keep private property prices in checked. This allows citizens to achieve their dream of owning a private property.

 
100% disagree. HDB should be HDB, for the masses. never pegged to private.

Well this is what is happening now... hdb resale drop lower and lower private goes up and up. 
 
If u think about it, it’s a positive feedback cuz this trend will encourage more and more hdb owners to upgrade asap.

That's the point isn't it.. that HDB prices should be low for the general masses. 
Those who are able to upgrade and have sufficient cash shouldn't be holding on to HDB in the first place. 
 
Eventually, the two segments will become more polarised. This would keep hdb flats affordable for those who need them and at the same time, those who prefer to invest will have to look at the private segment.
 
ECs will still serve its role as a filler for now but I do foresee that the incentives will be lowered in time to come.

Do u mind staying in hdb all your life then? With no hope of upgrading to private property? That is the likely outcome when the two segments get more polarised. 
Not sure about u, I would be pissed off if private property gets way more expensive. 
 
There is also the problem of social stratification. The hdb owners get poorer while the private property owners get richer...
 
To me the ideal scenario, is both hdb and private remains affordable.

and what precisely is wrong with this? got money upgrade, no money stay put. the purpose of HDB is to have a roof over ones head, not meant for speculation.

actually i am not exactly in agreement with your second last sentence because i feel hdb owners have got much more of state mechanism working in their favour via the generous plethora of hdb grants or subsidies, gst voucher, gst rebate, utility rebate, nss, ers etc.  if you realise also, they get more chance to make extraordinary gains from their hdb flat (example pinnacle) in prime location or in locations around mrt.  many of the highly sought after locations of properties are actually hdb property.
 
the hdb owners have the most chance to upgrade into private property.  those that still remains as hdb owners after many years, either don't fancy living in private or are the poorest of the lot.  and among the poorest of the lot, some of them actually are lazy to begin with.  the rest are admittedly down on their luck but they wouldn't form the majority of the hdb owners.

HDB owners tend to vote PAP.

The only way you can get Singaporeans to protest is to come up with a $54 handphone.

true, bulk of the unhappy people are actually unhappy with 2 things
1. income gap widening
2. property prices (ie pte vs hdb) widening
 
as a result, rich and middle-upper get richer, middle and poor get poorer
worse, enlightenment that lh99 hdb or pte eventually drop to $0 at 99th yr is a scary 'revelation', causing prices of older lh99 hdb and pte in ulu locations to go down slope

It keeps going down, if it really happens why not? 
People can upgrade the precinct they live in.
 
Don’t forget also that the lower the price falls, the greater the yield. The next buyer will be most appreciative.
 
Where got so many stepping stones in the past? The place where the stones are the most numerous are most well known for being opposition wards.
 
The proportion of private property owners has never exceeded 25% in the past, where is the basis of upgrading support for what you suggested?
 
Sometimes I really wonder if you have really bought in Sophia Hills area. You sound like you haven’t bought anything really.

Not exactly. I am disagreeing with the spirit of your statement that hdb owner gets poorer while the rich private property gets richer. While it is not directly mentioned, it suggests a link that the rich property owner profit from their appreciating private property while the hdb property owner gets poorer.  
I don't believe they can get poor because the appreciation of their property is slower. The private property owner also do not necessary get rich from property because rental income is paltry and realisation of capital gains also takes a long time. 
 
I believe these people got rich or poor largely through their main source of income and only partially from property income. Even if we pick examples of owners of multi private properties, they probably can get rich through rental collection of multi private properties because they have earned enough from their main source of income to afford so many. 
 
It is true that going forward, private property have higher likelihood to fare better but still there is still no direct link of poorness to owning a hdb.

You've really got me thinking. 
Is owning a private property so critical to ones survival that they have to migrate overseas or even riot on the streets if the govt policies don't favour this? 
 
Is it the job of the government to provide the citizens the stepping stone to 'move up to a private property' if not societal chaos may erupt?
 
Is this what ones aspirations should be about?

Much of the taxes collected from private property sales, I believe, go into the pockets of the Pioneer Gen and Merdeka generation.
 
For those generations, I really doubt many or any aspire to upgrade. Most of them choose to downgrade both size and tenure lor. The cheaper the happier.
 
The unhappy group think they are the majority but are actually the minority.

Foreigners are coming to town.
 
Expensive SG ... still think property prices gonna drop? 
 
https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/nouvel-18-sells-16-units-90-buyers-are-foreigners
Nouvel 18 sells 16 units; 90% of the buyers are foreigners
 

On the weekend of July 20 and 21, City Developments Ltd (CDL) released 30 units at luxury, freehold project, Nouvel 18. To date, 16 units or more than half of the units released have been sold, according to CDL. Units sold were predominantly three- and four-bedroom apartments.
 
About 90% of the buyers are said to be foreigners. “The foreign buyers were predominantly from Hong Kong and China,”

You've really got me thinking.
 
Is owning a private property so critical to ones survival that they have to migrate overseas or even riot on the streets if the govt policies don't favour this? 
 
Is it the job of the government to provide the citizens the stepping stone to 'move up to a private property' if not societal chaos may erupt?
 
Is this what ones aspirations should be about?
He got me thinking as well. 
I am not a papa support for various reasons. I, however, do not agree it is the govt's job to provide citizens hdb flats as a "stepping stone" to "upgrade" to private. No one owes anyone a living or success in life.
 
If one assume that his rights to upgrade has been taken away and wishes to migrate, by all means.
 
The rule might have changed and we need to evolve along.
 
I do understand everyone has different aspirations and I respect that. End of the day, I don't envy someone with 2 properties, drive a big car but kpkb kopi-O went up by 10cents.

Precisely. 
Yes I do agree that everyone has various aspirations.
 
But if everyone's aspirations become one of entitlement, Singapore is done.
 
I can provide my child with the right skills and knowledge, and of cos the necessities.
 
If my child expects me to subsidise his house, that's my prerogative. If my child still expects me to provide a condo at an ideal and expected price or he or she will move out of the country or create chaos in my house, then I must have failed as a parent.

Ya it’s great if u don’t have aspirations to own private, u live an easier life in Singapore. To me, the government has to make sure that there is a realistic path for most singaporeans to achieve their dreams and aspirations if they work hard...
 
In the past, the government did not give citizens free private condo. But they provided a path that if u work hard, buy a hdb, save up be prudent, most citizens can afford a private later in life.
 
I was thinking about why some countries has protests... I look at places like France, Malaysia, Hong Kong.... different standard of living, but all unhappy. I think people just get unhapy when they are not able to achieve the things they used to be able to get in the past or something got worse and worse and worse....
 
I also think can singapore survive such a period of unrest if it happens here. Singaporean are not as safe haven as some would think. Foreigners park the money here in our properties is because we follow rule of law, easier for them to take out their money if something goes south. 
 
I am not really joking about the emigration comment as I have thought how likely it is that singaporeans will be unhappy enough to protests and what happens after that.

every year there is people sore about missing the boatkeep complaining government never help to ease pricing, never solve income gap widening, never this never that 
blame the whole world but never blame ownself for procrastinating when prices were still within ownself tdsr limit
keep waiting for price to have major correction when prices so resilient even after donkey cycles of cooling measures
keep waiting for 'bubble burst' when there is no bubble
 
now prices continue to shoot up out of ownself salary affordable range, who to blame but ownself?

kids in school surely compare ownself to peers
 
if they stay hdb, they ask why others stay landed or pte condo 
if they take bus go school they ask why others come school in parent merc bmw
 
Vice versa
 
is human nature to compare, no one teach them
 
from the comparing is usually have 2 outcome, either they get motivated work hard strive to achieve one day stay landed drive Ferrari, or they get pessimistic feel inferior and resign to whole life staying hdb take bus mrt
 
question is: are you belong to 1st outcome or 2nd outcome

I agree to a certain extend that affordable housing is what was the basis of the journey of every youth in Singapore.
 
Things has change and the usual one room SIT rental flat or two room not going to cut it. So the govt came up with a IUP for lift and so on and so forth. Great, solve the pioneer generation who now are wheel chair bound and requires lift landing.
 
When you look at the changing landscape and IF you do have children, any parent will wish for a easier pathway to a environment that the child can look forward to.
 
Cost of living going up is inevitable.
 
Year on Year the salary will have a uplift as well. unless the CPI raise faster than the salary, than you have negative equity .

The economic growth of Singapore is likely to be slower and volatile.  I find it risky to pour so much life saving into 99 LH private properties that cost >$1,300 psf.
 
Unless Singapore experiences another period of sustained GDP growth of >3%, chances of enbloc for most of the 99 LH private properties is not that high.
 
Buying a BTO will be a lot more prudent and allows one to have a larger house.

How is HDB cheap? It is getting more expensive if you look at Annual household income vs HDB price. Not to mention that a 5 room now is much smaller than a 5 room in the past.

It keeps going down, if it really happens why not?
 
People can upgrade the precinct they live in.
 
Don’t forget also that the lower the price falls, the greater the yield. The next buyer will be most appreciative.
 
Where got so many stepping stones in the past? The place where the stones are the most numerous are most well known for being opposition wards.
 
The proportion of private property owners has never exceeded 25% in the past, where is the basis of upgrading support for what you suggested?
 
Sometimes I really wonder if you have really bought in Sophia Hills area. You sound like you haven’t bought anything really.

 
 
Although the private property account for less than 25% of the total housing stock, it does not mean that less than 25% of the voters own a private housing or aspire to own one. Quite a lot of the housing stock is rented to people who cannot vote. I suspect the locals are far more invested in private property than the raw number suggests.
 
I never bought Sophia Hills area lah... it is ORCHARD ROAD area (it is much closer to orchad road than sophia hills), more atas. Anyway, I have being arguing for years in this forum that private property prices need to be tied to HDB prices for the sake of the nation, country. I don't see why buying a property personally will change the rationale for that.

So either HDB needs to change its mission to allow all HDB residents the stepping stones to hop onto private territory. Because they are already doing so via the EC scheme...
 
Or URA needs to change its mission such that all private property prices need to be benchmarked to HDB prices.
 
Residents can actually buy commercial and industrial properties as well. We really don't have the land to allow every HDB resident to use their HDB as stepping stones, although arguably, many still are able to. If combined with parents or in-laws, that's 2-3 HDBs to play with already. A lot of times is not whether can or cannot, it's willing or non-willing that is the issue.
 
Income wise- the starting mean graduate salary is $3500 thereabout. In our time, it was about $2500-2700/ A graduate couple earning $7,000 per month today will reach $10,000 per month in a matter of 5-10 years of working. Some non-graduate, specialised jobs, single income also can reach 8-10K in 10 years. These numbers are rising as we speak. If they work hard and save well, the door is always open to them.

Not to mention that a 5 room now is much smaller than a 5 room in the past.cheap or not cheap is dependent on affordability most bto pricing in ulu location is still less than 3x of median annual household income
 
international norm say this is cheap
 
bto at near town area ccr and rcr can be double of those in ulu ocr locations , but quantity much lower compared to the ocr, so mass of the first time buyers still get cheap housing at ocr

can you name one country that peg or tie private housing price to public housing price for the sake of its nation and that the citizens all live happily ever after???

10k pm today is about median house hold incomeeg husband 5k pm and wife 5k per month
most of such income level is staying in hdb
 
at such income level to move to entry level EC, that nowadays cost 1080psf in ulu locations, may need to sell the existing bto, use the money to down-payment and borrow about 1mil loan that cost about 4.5k pm to service
 
not too bad, 1.5k pm balance for car loan and other loan, base on 60% tdsr

Well unless you are paying many tens of thousands in GST and and so are the others, we don't have enough to cover all the freebies that Singaporeans expect and whine about when they don't get them.
Perks for the senior generations don't come free..
Lower charges for public transport, more health subsidies etc, all cost $$..

That's fair that one has to sell.
If HDB dwellers can keep their HDB, I think it's only fair that everyone can buy a HDB even if they own a private home.

It's the same thing if the visit the foreign talent thread. Most are saying that PMETs must be protected because most here are white collared PMETs but can flood the market with low skilled foreign workers. No one gives a damn about how the lower educated Singaporeans are affected. Best part is that they'll later claim that those low income fellows are leeches asking for a handout. So much hypocrisy.
 
BTW, you sure you don't wanna move out of your HDB slum since you have 3 kids? Not scared tattooed ah beng come and teach them to be bad children?

 
ya...i get hit on both fronts in mcf as a hdb dweller and lowly cheapo storeman/caretaker  
 
btw, i am the 165kg tattooed ah beng who teaches kids to be bad children

I also think can singapore survive such a period of unrest if it happens here. Singaporean are not as safe haven as some would think. Foreigners park the money here in our properties is because we follow rule of law, easier for them to take out their money if something goes south. 
 
I am not really joking about the emigration comment as I have thought how likely it is that singaporeans will be unhappy enough to protests and what happens after that.
If your first point, are you really serious? You expect a realistic path to be provided by the govt? I might not be a papa support but I don't think this is a realistic expectation. 
On aspirations, everyone starts of life almost equal, some more equal, others less. It is just a matter of realistic life. I too aspire to be a pilot but my maths CMI. I struggle too in my 20s and 30s. I am happy with my hdb and looking forward to my condo being ready in a few months. Did the govt helped me along the way? Maybe.. Sometime.. No.. And I don't expect them to do so. 
 
I am not haolianing but, what I am trying to say is govt porviding hdb as a stepping stone to private is a wrong expectation.

I thought hdb Bto policy of pegging to resale hdb prices was a good idea. 
 
Still the entry point for a decent 900 sq ft apartment now is around how much? 1.4 million? Without any capitol gain from hdb, how many years do u think it will take to pay off the housing loan?

Nobody said must buy new and nobody said must buy 900 sqft. 
Where there is a will, there is a way.
 
Better to be vested earlier, that’s a definite.
 
I have relatives who bought 1400+ sqft at under 1000 PSF. I also know associates (no kids yet) who bought 500 sqft at 600,000 (maybe 1200 psf). 
 
One plans and charts his or her own game. What’s decent for one can be atrocious for another.

again, affordability issue here900sqf 1.4m refer to 1550psf pricing 
is around low-mid range 
should be affordable for median household income of 10k pm if sell the existing bto to upgrade
down 400k borrow 1mil for 25yr is monthly 4500 payment to bank, well below tdsr 60%
 
btw i notice u really like to peg this peg that

If your first point, are you really serious? You expect a realistic path to be provided by the govt? I might not be a papa support but I don't think this is a realistic expectation.
 
On aspirations, everyone starts of life almost equal, some more equal, others less. It is just a matter of realistic life. I too aspire to be a pilot but my maths CMI. I struggle too in my 20s and 30s. I am happy with my hdb and looking forward to my condo being ready in a few months. Did the govt helped me along the way? Maybe.. Sometime.. No.. And I don't expect them to do so. 
 
I am not haolianing but, what I am trying to say is govt porviding hdb as a stepping stone to private is a wrong expectation.

I think we are completely different wavelengths...
 
To me the first point is the fundamental job of the government, any government. I repeat my first point again.... “To me, the government has to make sure that there is a realistic path for most singaporeans to achieve their dreams and aspirations if they work hard...”
 
If we cannot agree on that... there isn’t nothing much to discuss....

Nobody said must buy new and nobody said must buy 900 sqft.
 
Where there is a will, there is a way.
 
Better to be vested earlier, that’s a definite.
 
I have relatives who bought 1400+ sqft at under 1000 PSF. I also know associates (no kids yet) who bought 500 sqft at 600,000 (maybe 1200 psf). 
 
One plans and charts his or her own game. What’s decent for one can be atrocious for another.
Errr... u say affordable so I am trying to find an average number to understand how affordable...  can not just spout nonsense right? Need some numbers.

How many years to get the 400k down? Start work at 24....
 
Remember if your bto is a depreciating asset instead of appreciating, u need more than 400k...
bto unlikely depreciation at 95th year mop hdb depreciating is more for older hdb over 30yr and in lousy locations
 
as to how long to save up 400k, again is affordability issue base on ownself capabilities
 
if cant even afford 25% down-payment, forget about pte la, continue in hdb like rest of 80% people

A bungalow there is a HDB here.
 
So now we need stepping stones to bungalow?

We need a roof over our heads, period.
 
If we need stepping stones to private (aka not hdb), why hdb get 99year lease? Might as well make it short, like 20 years. Since the endgame is to upgrade out of hdb, and the ideal "Singaporean dream" is to upgrade once MOP anyway which is like only 5 years.

keep complaining government never help to ease pricing, never solve income gap widening, never this never that 
blame the whole world but never blame ownself for procrastinating when prices were still within ownself tdsr limit
keep waiting for price to have major correction when prices so resilient even after donkey cycles of cooling measures
keep waiting for 'bubble burst' when there is no bubble
 
now prices continue to shoot up out of ownself salary affordable range, who to blame but ownself?
 Haha  
So they try to justify with reasons like recession retrenchment interest rate hike while hoping for prices to fall.

If US adopts cutting stance, no way for Sibor to go up.
 
But one thing to watch out for which may still sustain rates near 2% is the effect of SGD depreciation. It’s already happening, just refer to SGD versus all the other currencies. Even to Ringgit and Baht and USD we have fallen in value.
 
Depending on the final adjustments come Oct, we may then have a clearer sensing how much Sibor should fall. It may not be a lot, but at least there is the reassurance that rates should continue to be low in the short to medium term ahead.

Why does anyone owe citizens a dream of owning a private property?
 
HDB should be kept affordable. BTOs should not be pegged to resale HDBs. As long as BTOs are kept affordable, resale HDBs will not be too expensive and this will also put a lid on PP prices.

Actually there is another lid that is keeping px for HDB in check...that is TDSR and MSR.  Once everyone understand the difference, I guarantee HDB Px will plunge.

As mentioned prior, no one size fits all, diff folks diff requirements.
Today, whether buying for own stay/rental yield/capital appreciation, I would pick a old resale LH over new launch 99lh.
 
-New units new lease 99, but then you are also paying for it at high psf.
-Old units less lease years, you also pay less psf/overall quantum.
 
'Go resale for better value'
 
 
 

Merc, thanks for your advice. But why old resale LH and not old resale FH? Often times, the old resale FH is same Px as new LH, eg Mayfair Modern $1900-2000 psf but Floridian also around $1900-2000 psf.

That was if to compare new vs old LH only, resale would offer more 'value'
If for the high psf of new LH, then resale FH may be a better option.
 

Personally if buying, I won't even bother with new launches today. High selling psf for new LH, can get resale FH.
Above 1k psf for new EC, can get resale private condo in a better location near to mrt...etc 
'Go resale for better value' 
 
That said, diff strokes diff folks.


Reasons why FH gaining popularity, high psf of new 99LH, can get resale FH.
The other is due to last enbloc fever of FH projects, FH land is a thing of the past, all GLS is 99, if no enbloc where to find FH?
HDB/PTE different ball game, for PTE can enbloc top up lease to fresh 99. FH LH both got pro and con. Example FH not be in as good location as LH,next to mrt etc.
 
As mentioned prior, same principles apply can rent out either the hdb/pte 30 years cost more or less covered, still have 70 years to go 'FREE', which is a very loooooooong time. 
If concern of lease run down,can adopt appropriate approach at different stages of the 99 years.Example, sell within first 10-20 years.
 
Without enbloc, all future new launches to be only LH. For me, I won't be too duly concerned about it. High sell psf for new launches, I see more 'value' in resale, and those new 99 will eventually be older resale too. So even for old 20-30 years LH resales, may represent a 'value' buy whether own stay or rental capital appreciation investment.
Example, buying old resale own stay just put in 50-100k reno to 'brand new'. Buying for rental, lower cost pay less interest to bank higher yield etc.
 
Again, 99 years is a very long time can cover 2 generations. For the buyer, probably won't even have the chance to see lease running down to zero.

Chances of a September Fed rate cut increase
 
-The fed funds futures market now points to a 74% chance of at least a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed’s September meeting, according to CME FedWatch tool.
 
-Traders are also pricing in two more cuts to the benchmark lending rate to a range of 150 to 175 basis points by the end of 2019.
 
-The Fed on Wednesday dropped the target range for its overnight lending rate to 2% to 2.25%, or 25 basis points from the previous level.
 
-The central bank also left the door open to future cuts, saying it will “act as appropriate to sustain the expansion” as it continues to evaluate the incoming data.

Sometimes I really wonder if you have really bought in Sophia Hills area. You sound like you haven’t bought anything really.
Hahahaha......I think it was visioncrest.....but doesn’t matter lah. Keyboard warrior. 
 
Nowadays, more and more people skull not so thick already. Maybe thanks to social media.  Property agents also getting very creative in their selling. Recently some of you must have heard on the radio an Ad for a Ponggol EC where the guy did not want a pay increment? Actually one of my staff purposely decline a promotion.....ok, he asked me for a postponement of his promotion to year end so that he can qualify to apply for this new EC. 
 
I asked him why not start with a resale HDB like most of his generation and he gave me a Long lecture on the merits and demerits of HDB vs EC vs Condo.  Ok, I did not entirely agree with his arguments but nevertheless it shows there is a shift in buyers mentality with regards to what is a viable property to purchase that can secure their future retirement.

I understand the 2017 enlightenment that hdb value become zero at 99th year caused hdb price to plunge,but why tdsr and msr have this effect

I dunno.....my young staff explained to me.  That’s why he said he does not want to buy new HDB flat.  He wants to buy EC which will become privatised eventually.  His argument is that as long as your future buyer is capped from borrowing more (vis-a-vis private property), it will be difficult for one to see good appreciation even if your resale HDB property is in downtown CBD. He further reasoned to me another cap is foreigners are never allowed to buy HDB.  As long as there is a barrier to market demand, the good cannot achieve its maximum price appreciation.  Sounds broadly logical to me.
 
Then i asked him why don’t jump straight to a resale condo with the same quantum?  He said they are old, must reno, no modern facilities and most of all, sometimes banks can’t match the resale owners high asking px makes him choose EC over resale.  
 
Well...if this is how the buyers are thinking....and if more think this way....tell me how will the price of HDB be like in the future.  Ok, maybe not plunge....but you get the drift.

HDB was never meant to be an asset until Mr Mah talked it up..
Now despite Mr Lawrence Wong's comments, people still expect to make millions and many still expect the government to rescue them when the lease is up.. and this is despite the numerous posts and comments on the lease issue..
Some HDBs are really impressive, in design and some have wonderful views... but ultimately they are an affordable way for people to live comfortably and safely. That's their main goal.

Can’t `like’ you...but thanks for your reply.  
 
Actually recently a XMM agent try to get me to sell my old FH in D9 and switch out to a D9 LH99.  I was kinda tempted because that’s where i met my first love on mambo nights lol.  But I don’t buy her argument that it’s hard for old FH to achieve px appreciation and that all resale properties will stay stagnant (LH maybe drop, FH stagnant at best....).  However when i plotted my properties and some other LH and FH properties, she does have a point.  
 
Anyway, for now, I’m toying with the idea of buying under my son’s name with me as a trustee.  No reason for me to buy with my name and pay more ABSD.  My last purchase already caused me 10% ABSD....now 15%......very hard to swallow.

Your colleague is not wrong but he conveniently forgot 1 other group of people - retirees with cash from enbloc or currently living in condo but wanna downgrade. We are facing aging society. I, for one, will wanna to live very near to town when I retire. I can save on transport and I do not need facilities. I probably need good park connectors for morning jog or walk. Good area HDBs will meet these requirements. Ulu ECs will not. Just my thoughts.

You can save even more by living in Ulu HDBs. There are town centres for your basic needs.
 
Everything else, get the good to come to you.
Ya. But I am city person. Once you live downtown reaching airport in 10 min, vivocity in 5 min, very hard to move out. Hahaha.

Anyway, for now, I’m toying with the idea of buying under my son’s name with me as a trustee. No reason for me to buy with my name and pay more ABSD. My last purchase already caused me 10% ABSD....now 15%......very hard to swallow.

 
Remember to budget for full cash if buy under trust.

Actually recently a XMM agent try to get me to sell my old FH in D9 and switch out to a D9 LH99. I was kinda tempted because that’s where i met my first love on mambo nights lol. But I don’t buy her argument that it’s hard for old FH to achieve px appreciation and that all resale properties will stay stagnant (LH maybe drop, FH stagnant at best....). However when i plotted my properties and some other LH and FH properties, she does have a point.

Bro ...... can explain exactly what happens when a property is bought in as you as the ‘trustee’ though legally the Title Deed will show only your sons name , or does it also show your name as Trustee and any effect on Loans taking ?? And if rented out whose income is it ??

That Trust thingy mentioned in the article is for under 21 year olds , but what about kids whom are above 21 ?? I take it that the property will become 100% in the kids name and parents have no say on it after that ....... kind of risky in today’s world

One fine day, all of them may not matter.My very elderly dad still travels all the way from Balestier to Chinatown to get his toiletries from his favourite shop. He could have got them at whampoa. My MIL loves and swears by the food, wet market at honglim and chinatown even she has fantastic wet market at boon keng. My neighbour, retired uni lecturer, moved out of her condo and bought a hdb to stay at cantonment. It is not just the amenities and shopping for the chic, it is a mixture of old and modern at downtown.

I dunno.....my young staff explained to me. That’s why he said he does not want to buy new HDB flat. He wants to buy EC which will become privatised eventually. His argument is that as long as your future buyer is capped from borrowing more (vis-a-vis private property), it will be difficult for one to see good appreciation even if your resale HDB property is in downtown CBD. He further reasoned to me another cap is foreigners are never allowed to buy HDB. As long as there is a barrier to market demand, the good cannot achieve its maximum price appreciation. Sounds broadly logical to me.
 
Then i asked him why don’t jump straight to a resale condo with the same quantum? He said they are old, must reno, no modern facilities and most of all, sometimes banks can’t match the resale owners high asking px makes him choose EC over resale.
 
Well...if this is how the buyers are thinking....and if more think this way....tell me how will the price of HDB be like in the future. Ok, maybe not plunge....but you get the drift.

 
hahaha nowadays only youngsters with low income can buy ECs lah
hdb dont allow people like us buy, due to hdb income ceiling set until so low , cant qualify to buy
 
btw i think old hdb price surely continue to drop or maintain low, likewise old LH99 pte , same fate as old hdb
plunge to zero $ at 99th year

not i say one, is 2017 enlightenment say one

Your colleague is not wrong but he conveniently forgot 1 other group of people - retirees with cash from enbloc or currently living in condo but wanna downgrade. We are facing aging society. I, for one, will wanna to live very near to town when I retire. I can save on transport and I do not need facilities. I probably need good park connectors for morning jog or walk. Good area HDBs will meet these requirements. Ulu ECs will not. Just my thoughts.ðIt's true. A friend of mine fits into your description exactly. From enbloc condo to HDB maisonette but near to MRT, market. No need facilities anymore.

do you disqualify your son from owning a HDB if you do that?
Honestly, I do not see what’s the attraction of HDB right now, Most of the new HDB are all far out in the suburbs and the supply is plentiful. Those good location HDB flats are like lottery punting.
 
After getting it, my Son has to wait for 3 years to build I think plus 5 years before he can resells it and only to Singaporean’s or PR ( restricted  market ).  And not to mentioned the MSR vs TDSR new policy enacted since 2013.....
 
Taking all the above and maybe some other considerations, I think buying a HDB, on the contrary , actually DISQUALIFY my son from getting a private property. In any case, HDB has a purpose and its meant for the lower income or those who choose not to buy private and never intend to treat HDB as an investment tool.  Champion by some here in the forum.  I totally agree with them.  
 
So I am fine to disqualify my Son from buying a HDB.  The returns from a private condo will outstrip any new HDB in my humble opinion even with all the so called grants and subsidies.  If that is what you are concern with my disqualification of my Son from getting a HDB.   I have thought through it...it is ok as I mentioned above, I think it’s the other way round...the disqualification to buy a private property at an earlier age...ie, get on the property game as early as possible.

You and your son have the means to choose something else more expensive 
That’s not an option for more than 70% of our population 
No doubt these new flats aren’t in CCR but they cost a lot less. 
With these savings you can pay for kids education, have an overseas holiday every other year and maybe get a 2nd hand. Don’t forgot the median income is still around 4-5k ... 
I’m sure yours is much higher 
Can not compare la..

Isn't this the problem?
 
I think F10 way is the most profitable assuming HDB continues to depreciates and private continues to go up, assuming you have the means.
 
Although most people don't see the problem right now, trust me, when its is more OBVIOUS as this trend continues, that 70% is going to feel pissed off when they are stuck with a property 15 years later worth only a fraction of what they paid while those private property owners are sitting one properties worth millions.

HDB was never meant to be an asset until Mr Mah talked it up..
Now despite Mr Lawrence Wong's comments, people still expect to make millions and many still expect the government to rescue them when the lease is up.. and this is despite the numerous posts and comments on the lease issue..
Some HDBs are really impressive, in design and some have wonderful views... but ultimately they are an affordable way for people to live comfortably and safely. That's their main goal.
I categorically disagree about asset definition. 
Anything that can be used to house oneself and family for decades has inherent value and can be seen as assets.
 
One can still cash out after 20 years to downgrade size and partially fund retirement.
 
It retains a good portion of its value over time and suffers minimal annual depreciation, unless you buy one with 30 years lease left.
 
Recently heard of many young people (mostly very savvy although) buying old resales, at cut throat low prices. The grants can be humongous.

necessary to wait till left 30yr mehnowadays lh99 public or pte left 60yr demand and prices already dwindling liao
can't imagine how price will slide if left less than 50yr
some more with cheap land made available from vers, ie if it happens eventually, these hdb land can be converted for pte use, by then developers will be spoilt for choice with more cheap lh99 land, do they still need to pay exorbitant price for lh99 private enbloc to obtain land?

It can already be seen happening already. Old low rise flats in old estates are being replaced with 30-40 floors, smaller unit size. Huge open air public carparks being replaced with multi-storey. Can see the huge plot ratio increase and amount of land freed up. Still a lot  more potential especially in old estates with many many low rise flats.

Another way to look at it is that @F10_blackhawk is looking at how wealth can be preserved and even enhanced with buying in trust. 
It’s not just about his next generation but the generations that follow as well.
Isn’t it true everybody was hoping (or at least don’t mind) that their grandparents have left behind a legacy for them?

You've really got me thinking.
 
Is owning a private property so critical to ones survival that they have to migrate overseas or even riot on the streets if the govt policies don't favour this?
 
Is it the job of the government to provide the citizens the stepping stone to 'move up to a private property' if not societal chaos may erupt?
 
Is this what ones aspirations should be about?

 
IMO, no, but despite the lofty aims of some participants in the demonstrations, there are some who are there simply because they have become marginalised by the super high costs of living in HKG..

even if not recycle as 40storey new HDB, all these low rise hdb when the government take back, they can always choose to sell the land to pte developers for building lh99 condo at cheaper prices than pte enbloc pricings

There are equal or greater numbers of those FH that are failing in enbloc attempts. 
Just to present a fairer picture.
 
Transaction wise, relatively new LH are running neck and neck with new FH and ahead of old FH. Old FH is pricier than old LH but there is a premium paid upfront as well.
 
Remember Govt will value new LH land to FH land price minus 4%.

i hope the new VERS can release alot more cheap lh99 land from public to pte so that developers no need to pay these old lh99 owners exorbitant prices for the lh99 segment
 
for the fh market, there is no such thing as VERS to increase fh supply , so i guess its a matter of more scarce fh lead to more demand and hence higher price for fh every year
 
we will see fh landed and condo prices keep shooting up annually! whereas for lh99, 30yr+ already got problem finding enbloc takers (eg 30yr+ mandarin garden and 30yr+ pine grove ZERO BID in their recent enbloc attempt)

the way i see it, once cross the 50yr mark, lh99 public or pte prices will drop like lao-sai
hence nowadays nobody want to buy old lh99

whereas for fh is older the better, like fine cognac

old lh99 ? stale beer i guess

they will die a natural death at 99th year if really no takers

These two are amongst the largest sites available in SG. 
Regardless of lease they are extremely hard for developers to swallow due to extremely high quantum.

Ageing population does not mean more people buy FH. 
It means more will go for short leases. Even 60 year private LH should be in the pipeline already.
 
Not everyone subscribes to full investment and inheritance through housing (FH). For some, partial investment and inheritance (private LH) will suffice. For some, they do not even consider it (HDB).

read again, i did not say more aging population mean more people buy fh
i am saying aging property is like aging population, there is a growing number in the pipeline as the years go by
 
do not mix up aging population with fh demand
fh demand is not dependent on the no of aged, its dependent on the affordability of the buyers
also the price is dependent on the supply, if it is scarce compared to lh99, fh prices will have an advantage over lh99
plus fh do not depreciate to zero value, hence is superior in retaining value compared to lh99
 
people who invest in fh do not mind the additional quantum over lh99, because end of the day if enbloc, the payout will more than compensate the quantum
 
the question is, all else being equal, which has a bigger enbloc demand and which command a premium - fh or lh99?
ask any developer, the answer is clear
 

this is exactly why people nowadays go for fh instead of old lh99

the most worrying thing about holding to a old lh99 is not just the fact that it depreciate to nothing at 99th year, but also more and more aged lh99 coming up in the next decade
 
what is going to happen to the prices of these 50yr old hdb and lh99 condos?

To set the record straight, it’s much easier to get the enbloc agreed by owners of LH than it is to get agreement by FH owners. 
The expectations will still be capped by developer and buyer’s ability to afford.
 
Many secondhand buyers of old FH are stuck in limbo as well, certainly you are aware?

Big Read: No easy answers to HDB lease decay issue, but public mindset has to change first
 
https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/big-read-no-easy-answers-hdb-lease-decay-issue-public-expectations-have-change-first
 
 
"Similarly, Mr Calvin Loh, 38, a hardware goods showroom manager, said he is also getting anxious about the value of his Commonwealth Close flat, which has 47 years of lease left.
He noted how a former neighbour sold his three-room unit for S$400,000 four years ago, but a similar unit in the same block changed hands for just S$280,000 a few months ago."
To set the record straight, it’s much easier to get the enbloc agreed by owners of LH than it is to get agreement by FH owners.The expectations will still be capped by developer and buyer’s ability to afford.Many secondhand buyers of old FH are stuck in limbo as well, certainly you are aware?
 
LOL!the biggest comfort for FH owners is they are not worried at all, because the fh value do not depreciate every year and eventually to $ZERO at 99th year like their lh99 counterpart
 
nowadays people with old lh99 worry holding to depreciating  'asset' , which end of the day most of them will not get any lifeline, only to depreciate to ZERO at 99th year! this is 2017 enlightenment coming true
 
see the article above, old hdb used to sell $400k few year ago, nowadays same unit $280k nia, price drop like lao-sai and still dropping
let me calculate har, 400k to 280k = 30% drop after the enlightenment !!
huge depreciation to mark the 50th anniversary of ownership!!

Can’t `like’ you...but thanks for your reply.  
 
Actually recently a XMM agent try to get me to sell my old FH in D9 and switch out to a D9 LH99.  I was kinda tempted because that’s where i met my first love on mambo nights lol.  But I don’t buy her argument that it’s hard for old FH to achieve px appreciation and that all resale properties will stay stagnant (LH maybe drop, FH stagnant at best....).  However when i plotted my properties and some other LH and FH properties, she does have a point.  
 
Anyway, for now, I’m toying with the idea of buying under my son’s name with me as a trustee.  No reason for me to buy with my name and pay more ABSD.  My last purchase already caused me 10% ABSD....now 15%......very hard to swallow.
As mentioned prior ... no worries with the 'like' 
Many factors to consider to wanna switch FH to LH, should have compelling reasons to do so, which you know best.
 
As for trustee, if son not going the BTO route and gonna be a gift for him anyway, that's definitely one way to go around the ABSD.

As mentioned prior, no one size fits all, diff folks diff requirements.
Today, whether buying for own stay/rental yield/capital appreciation, I would pick a old resale LH over new launch 99lh.
 
-New units new lease 99, but then you are also paying for it at high psf.
-Old units less lease years, you also pay less psf/overall quantum.
 
'Go resale for better value'
 
An example of buyer paying $2.05 million for a unit with 62 years lease balance, when could have gotten a brand new 99LH or FH of smaller size. 
Could be enbloc millionaire as replacement home for the space, investor punting for future enbloc ... or both 
 
https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/resale-unit-nexus-reaps-122-mil-profit
 

At Bedok Court, the seller of an eighth floor unit made the third most profitable transaction of the week with a $1.11 million gain. The 2,411 sq ft, three-bedroom unit was bought for $940,000 ($390 psf) in November 1996, and sold for $2.05 million ($850 psf) on July 18. The seller made a 118% profit, or an annualised profit of 3% over nearly 23 years.
 
Located in District 16, at Bedok South Avenue 3, the 99-year leasehold Bedok Court was developed by Bedokville Development, a subsidiary of Lum Chang Holdings. Completed in 1985, it has 62 years left on its lease.

pls lah, let your son independently decide for himself when the time come lah
 
you mean nowadays parents need to decide even this kind of thing for the children ah? so dependent on the parent meh

 
On the contrary, don't you think I am actually giving him more choices?  He can choose to dispose of the private property and buy a resale HDB.  On current regulations, he can buy a HDB on the resale market immediately.  
 
So yes, as parents, I will do all I can to allow my children have more choices in life.  You mean, given a choice, you will rather let him go through hardships (and yeah, maybe learn from the hard knocks and emerge stronger lol) then to give him as much options as possible to decide what to do?  
 
Well, I'm fine if that's how you wanna raise your child or children.  For me, I honestly feel there is no need to ask my child to `fight' for the subsidy and grants when it was meant to help others who actually need it.  While technically, as a citizen, he is entitled to this first bite of the cherry, I feel there is no need to encourage such `entitlement' mentality, give it to others who need it more than him.  
 
Having said the above, and as mentioned in the previous post of mine, I actually feel he will be better off to start off with a private property and build his wealth from there than start with HDB.  Incidentally, I subscribe to the belief HDB is not an investment tool.  We really should keep it as the basic form of roof / shelter for the majority of the population.  The moment we relax that assumption, I'm positive we WILL end up like Hong Kong.

to me lee ka shing is the model father
billionaire but make the sons work for their money
let them learn the hardway and independant
let them earn their own fortune

since you mentioned HK, the property prices in HK skyrocket is because half of the properties in HK is not state-owned
prices are controlled by private sector
the government who control the public housing, on the other hand, are not building enough to cater to the demand
hence double whammy - public cannot make it, private cannot make it
who suffer?
the youngsters suffer

2mil today is a low-middle quantum
most likely 60th percentile income type
 
if want to buy resale FH, 2mil cant get much space, maybe 1000-1100sqf
 
if new lh99 , 2mil got more choices and larger space as well, depending on location
but if you ask me, FH over lh99 anytime, for obvious reasons

I categorically disagree about asset definition.
 
Anything that can be used to house oneself and family for decades has inherent value and can be seen as assets.
 
One can still cash out after 20 years to downgrade size and partially fund retirement.
 
It retains a good portion of its value over time and suffers minimal annual depreciation, unless you buy one with 30 years lease left.
 
Recently heard of many young people (mostly very savvy although) buying old resales, at cut throat low prices. The grants can be humongous.

 
what you mentioned above is totally contradictory to this newspaper article published today (see underlined below): 
https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/big-read-no-easy-answers-hdb-lease-decay-issue-public-expectations-have-change-first
 
 
 
"To these long-time homeowners, it does not matter that in absolute terms, the price which they can get for their ageing flat will be many times higher than what they bought it for.
What weighs on their mind is the worry that they are not getting a high enough price, relative to what they could have gotten when the flat was younger or the cost of an alternative home on the market today.
 
Mr Ku Swee Yong, chief executive officer of International Property Advisor, noted that the situation has been made worse by buyers overpaying for ageing resale flats in recent years, and price decline going forward is “inevitable”.
“(The) prices of well-located old flats have reached high levels not commensurate with their future cash flow value (from a rental perspective),” he said."

Applying a common industry forecasting template that correlates the value of land with respect to its remaining lease, Mr Ku predicts that a flat which was completed in 1975 — and priced at S$860,000 today — would fetch only S$180,000 in 2054, when it has 20 years of lease left
In less than 30years all property in HK will be state owned! Hahah.

Ku Swee Yong has made so many erroneous predictions and assumptions that I have lost count. 
You would do better in the property market following my posts from 2015.
 
He did not and would not analyse the whole market in complete contexts.

or perhaps change profession become fortune teller, since you say you have track records of crystal ball gazing since 2015... LOL!

i guess the truth is singapore is entering a new realm of aging properties , ie those with half of its lh99 left, and currently experiencing decaying property values for these older lh99
there is no previous data or information to support predictions of what is going to happen next
but for sure if nothing is done, these value will become zero at 99th year
what can be done is to throw lifeline, VERS for public and enbloc for PTE
but can we throw lifelines to every lh99?
impossible
so what happens to those who dont get a lifeline?
 
your guess is as good as mine
 
instead of betting on which old lh99 gets lifeline, people rather put their money in FH now
safer than lh99 in terms of holding the value and much more potential for value appreciation and enbloc chances

Every prediction including Trump and Brexit can be found in this forum. Where it’s 50-50, I would indicate so as well. 
To the mainstream media, my views would be radical. No chance to be published as well.

Yup that works for a certain strata of people, but mostly baby boomer generation.Hmm...I am not baby boomer generation. Both my wife and I find it so hard to move out of town area even we can have profit out of current home. Even my son does not mind waking up at 5+am every morning to take school bus just to stay on where we are. It spreads across 3 gen just using my family as an example. It is the quality of life, not the facilities of condo. But nvr say nvr, maybe I will move out of city centre if my finances forbid in future. But no if given a choice.

Hahaha......i dun really model other people....i am my own man....i follow myself and what i think is correct and the best way forward.  Many like to find a model template and think by copying the template, they can short cut the route to success.  To me that’s actually laziness....You talked about `learning the hard way’....yet in the same sentence you chose a role model to follow.  That’s very `creative’ lol
 
You really think LKS believes the hard way is the way to train his Son?  Then why put Richard Li in charge of PCCW.  Why not ask him sell mobile handphone on the shop floor at Mongkok, hahaha. Why not put him through the hardest way?  Coz LKS has decided for Richard Li many things already....so dun come and tell me the best way for your children is to let him learn through the school of hard knocks.

Remember to budget for full cash if buy under trust.
Thanks, will do.
Bro ...... can explain exactly what happens when a property is bought in as you as the ‘trustee’ though legally the Title Deed will show only your sons name , or does it also show your name as Trustee and any effect on Loans taking ?? And if rented out whose income is it ??
Can’t take loan, have to use cash.  Rental incomes goes straight to the trust but it can be used to offset expenses.

Bro
You and your son have the means to choose something else more expensive 
That’s not an option for more than 70% of our population 
No doubt these new flats aren’t in CCR but they cost a lot less. 
With these savings you can pay for kids education, have an overseas holiday every other year and maybe get a 2nd hand. Don’t forgot the median income is still around 4-5k ... 
I’m sure yours is much higher 
Can not compare la..

Please don’t get me wrong, nothing wrong with the new HDB flats.  However, i am traditional...so i still subscribe to CCR is the best. As Long as I can afford it, i will go for CCR or RCR.  
 
You are also right the grants and subsidies can be significant.. I know, thus i feel there is no need for my son to also muscle his way in to take advantage of these grants or subsidies.

One thing going for FH property buyers is that although they may not see the capital come back in their lifetime, they can rest assured that their next generation will benefit some day.
 
Like you mentioned somewhere, sitting on gold mine. But the gold mine recognition may or may not come in your lifetime, and provided Govt does not acquire it compulsorily (only pay you new 99LH land + 4% + infrastructure value).
 
People who buy such properties, in a lot of cases, are safekeeping it for future generations.
 
So I do hope you realise how much of a clash and how odd it sounds.
 
People who really aim to let their children fight for their own cake will not leave more than they need to.

Like you mentioned somewhere, sitting on gold mine. But the gold mine recognition may or may not come in your lifetime, and provided Govt does not acquire it compulsorily (only pay you new 99LH land + 4% + infrastructure value).
 
People who buy such properties, in a lot of cases, are safekeeping it for future generations.
 
So I do hope you realise how much of a clash and how odd it sounds.
 
People who really aim to let their children fight for their own cake will not leave more than they need to.
many ways to play the fh game you only painted a very narrow scenario
how about people with 2 or more fh
how about enbloc and reinvest
how about resale n encash

Yes these are what we already know.
 
But to meet all of them, just need to select a good LH. With great location attributes, the chance to meet all the conditions with LH is much higher, with owners having a similar mindset of 99 years, sell by 40 years. Many who invest in FH, they do not mind it if they never get a chance to enbloc and reject all opportunities, in the end passing to their next generations to sell.
 
The same amount to invest also carries one further for LH unless one bumps into a low priced FH. And a lot of times, a property is low priced for some reason (might be undiscovered gem or might be a long long long hold).

not truejust comparing lh99 and fh tenure alone , fh definitely has advantages over lh99, all else being equal, for obvious reasons
 
the biggest fear of lh99 owners is depreciating asset and zero value at 99th yr and no lifeline
 
fh don't have such fears hence gaining popularity nowadays

Like I said you are indeed the best father ever a child can find lol. Giving them the `best environment' for them to learn how to grow up and be successful in life.  
 
And you must be very rich....is your last name Ng?  Buying house is simple for you, hahaha...oh actually there is no need to buy....with a Ng surname, its inherited.....  
 
To me, having safety nets and more options are never a bad thing in life.  It allows one to boldly try different and more things without fear of making mistakes.  And making mistakes earlier in a person's life has less consequences than if the mistakes are made later in life.  This is why it gets harder for one to go into business when one is in his 40s or 50s since there are a lot to lose.  And in unforgiving Singapore, if there is no safety net, many of us know 1 mistake can be fatalistic and set one's life back for decades.  For every 1 successful romantic story of rages to riches, grinding it out through tough environment, there are 10,000 other failed business ventures.  
 
Without the net, most would play it safe and take the tried and tested path though we all know past success is not a guarantee of future performance. Again nothing wrong with this path and it is necessary for society to have such stability of 80/20 rule.  However, it is also usually when one is at wits end that they are either forced to try new things or they just give up.  Research may have shown that's when the mind is at its most creative but I rather not test this hypothesis.  Sgcarmart2019, You are welcome to try it on your children and I'm happy if your child turn out to be the next Steve Jobs.
 
So thanks, but no thanks.  I increase the chance of success for my children in this new world by encouraging them to try different things.  There is no need for them to follow the beaten path even if it means its proven to succeed or work.  There is also less templates to follow if one does different things from the masses so naturally they will be plenty of opportunities to learn to find solutions creatively on their own.  And certainly mistakes will be made and these mistakes made earlier in life will have less consequences and put them in good stead later in their career. 
 
Recently my son asked me if he should take triple science and Advanced Math for his Year 3 IP program.  So I asked him if he had thought what inspires him? (Note I did not ask which career path does he envision himself to take in the future....tempting, leading question but I deliberately took a different approach).  He came back a week later and told me actually he is inspired by his History teacher and he wants to teach History in the future. He wants to inspire young minds like his teacher did to him and his class and he also enjoys imparting knowledge and coaching his juniors.
 
He also know this is probably not what my wife would like to hear because she is a doctor.  However, I told him, follow your dreams not what you think we want you to be.  Furthermore, being a doctor is a calling, you must want to serve in the health care sector to be a doctor.  Besides, one does not really have to take triple science at this stage to be a doctor anyway (that's my backdoor).  And I asked him to reflect further...does he enjoy inspiring minds (he must have watched those MOE ads in the cinemas) in general (my wife lectures in NUS Med School besides running her own clinic, haha) or because he enjoys history and at the same time has an engaging and inspiring History Teacher?  He is still thinking about it....well...sgcarmart2019....this is a snapshot of how I raise my children....
 
Sweet, bitter medicine....Poison?  I don't know....the script is still being written as I type.....haha

Hmm...a pity u choose not to read the long story. 
No prefect parents or perfect parenting. Reminds me of a sharing:
 
A child was crying and yelling in a play pen. 
 
When the mother was asked "why aren't you going to the child to carry him and calm him down?"
 
Mother's reply, "oh he will be fine in a awhile. Just leave him be and its good for his lungs to be exercising such"
 
Another mum "no way. I rather he be comforted and held to know he's loved and safe. He can exercise his lungs when he's older."
 
One's own child, one ought to know better. Hopefully this is  still true and holds water when its time to be stretched them lung muscles.
 
Enjoying the exchanges of thoughts here. Thanks for sharing.
 
Safe ride
Cheers

I guess only your son knows, in reality, whether he's got a good and caring father. 
But thanks for sharing your views on choice to let your children have more options since it is within your ability to help open up more windows and doors to let him decide what he likes.

To be honest, I did not belittle him. 
I was only surprised why he would interpret data and trends at face value without due consideration of human factors.
 
The only thing I might have belittled are his views and not him.

"Ku Swee Yong has made so many erroneous predictions and assumptions that I have lost count.
 
You would do better in the property market following my posts from 2015.
 
He did not and would not analyse the whole market in complete contexts."

Bro we talk cock sing song on property here, let's not get into the undertones here of threatening people that they will get into lawsuits over this kinda trivia. If a negative opinion can get someone sued, just imagine the endless ones on TripAdvisor and even rotten tomatoes.. courts can open 24-7 too. 
I think Mr Ku has better things to do..

Precisely. 
You're not Mr Ku.
 
Then who are you to speculate on his behalf that he may even think of threatening legal action?
 
One, in any occupation, should know that it is not possible for 100% to like or support one's measures. Just like it's impossible to like 100% of people.

In 2010, he wrote that buyers are not clear minded about buying shoeboxes and that there might not be real demand for such housing upon completion. Oddly, he used to live in a 120 sqft property overseas. If he can, what makes him feel that people cannot live in a place 3-4 times bigger? Buyers I felt were very clear about limitations of shoeboxes and went in with eyes wide open. All his reservations were quite unfounded. Shoebox apartments are still the first to sell out in new sales and continue to command the highest yielding premium across all private housing. Modern technologies have made living in smaller spaces so much more viable; I was surprised he did not see that.  
Nowadays the authorities are allowing even fewer of such units, and the price has kept turning northward, may not even get to buy any now as potential buyers missed their opportunity with increased taxes and CMs from that period.
 
In JAN 2018, after 4 years of index decline and market was in early stabilising and recovery state amidst worldwide raging prices in HK, China, etc, he claimed that it was too early to celebrate. Prices continued to run on month after month and was so hot that new CMs were installed in July 2018. In the same article, he also questioned how can 48,000 housing units explain for an increase of only 5,000 residents. The number crunching failed to include the ever increasing single person households and couples without children households. Much of the new supply was also to house older couples while more households are formed. Some of the units serve long term investment needs as well (buying for long term rent, inheritance etc). Some other figures in our population changes were not addressed.
 
In March 2018, he has made some good points about the ageing population and increase in flats available due to passing of all owners. But it was conflicting to read that prices of HDBs would continue to fall while there would be no demand from the young. It was odd also to suggest countermeasures to absorb the supply, such as allowing children to inherit the flat even if they do not meet eligibility conditions. Certainly, an easier policy for HDB would be simply to build less; ultimately, not everyone fancies an outskirt BTO flat. With new government grants in place, ultimately Govt would step in to provide the impetus for young couples to consider older HDBs, ready to absorb the supply if it comes.
 
These are just three of the major areas (based on his blog) in which I disagree with his views on housing. There are many more that I can find as well.
 
He should actually thank me for reading his articles and helping him raise his PR profiles.

I get your drift. 
But there was no personal attack or slander making a suit viable. His views were indeed proven to be wrong or incomplete. 
 
If like that can sue, HDB also can technically sue anyone for claiming a HDB is not an asset just based on the fact that IF it reaches 99 years, it would have zero value. What about the 99 years of potential and / or actual usage of the property?

again, no need to explain to me laI not your lawyer 
if his lawyer letter reach you then u start to look for your own lawyer for legal advise loh

In 2010, he wrote that buyers are not clear minded about buying shoeboxes and that there might not be real demand for such housing upon completion. Oddly, he used to live in a 120 sqft property overseas. If he can, what makes him feel that people cannot live in a place 3-4 times bigger? Buyers I felt were very clear about limitations of shoeboxes and went in with eyes wide open. All his reservations were quite unfounded. Shoebox apartments are still the first to sell out in new sales and continue to command the highest yielding premium across all private housing. Modern technologies have made living in smaller spaces so much more viable; I was surprised he did not see that.
 
Nowadays the authorities are allowing even fewer of such units, and the price has kept turning northward, may not even get to buy any now as potential buyers missed their opportunity with increased taxes and CMs from that period.
 
In JAN 2018, after 4 years of index decline and market was in early stabilising and recovery state amidst worldwide raging prices in HK, China, etc, he claimed that it was too early to celebrate. Prices continued to run on month after month and was so hot that new CMs were installed in July 2018. In the same article, he also questioned how can 48,000 housing units explain for an increase of only 5,000 residents. The number crunching failed to include the ever increasing single person households and couples without children households. Much of the new supply was also to house older couples while more households are formed. Some of the units serve long term investment needs as well (buying for long term rent, inheritance etc). Some other figures in our population changes were not addressed.
 
In March 2018, he has made some good points about the ageing population and increase in flats available due to passing of all owners. But it was conflicting to read that prices of HDBs would continue to fall while there would be no demand from the young. It was odd also to suggest countermeasures to absorb the supply, such as allowing children to inherit the flat even if they do not meet eligibility conditions. Certainly, an easier policy for HDB would be simply to build less; ultimately, not everyone fancies an outskirt BTO flat. With new government grants in place, ultimately Govt would step in to provide the impetus for young couples to consider older HDBs, ready to absorb the supply if it comes.
 
These are just three of the major areas (based on his blog) in which I disagree with his views on housing. There are many more that I can find as well.
 
He should actually thank me for reading his articles and helping him raise his PR profiles.

My take is Singapore is flushed with a supply of expensive 99-year LH properties from 2019 to 2021.  These prices were the result of very confident developers and cash-rich enbloc owners.  The rental is not able to support these prices, hence together with ABSD most investors should be out.
 
If there are still many owner-buyers, then Singapore is likely to have an escalating number of households with very large debts/loans above $1 mil.  If this economy downturn continues to next year, there is a good chance that many of these new buyers will be struggling with their loans.
 
A BTO is perfectly fine with its high government subsidy and low cost of ownership.  I think the 99-year lease issue of HDB is overblown.  If HDB relaxes its ownership rule (eventually I think it will with some restrictions), even with 20 or 30 years left, the rental yield is very attractive and able to support prices.

hdb is always the backbone of Singapore property though in recent years the demand for aged hdb has dropped significantly, new bto pricing is still very low, is still the base that form the support (low means =<3yr of median annual household income, for current Singapore median hh income is about 9500pm)  
this public segment of the property market must always remain this way, be cheap and abundant so that we do not have to go into HK situation. is like hawker centres, public swimming pools, mrt, polyclinics, cheap yet abundant to cater to 80% mass
 
those who can afford to make the jump to upgrade to private always have entry level EC and low end pte lh99 to play with, and these low end pte in turn seek mid to mid-high pte to upgrade to, and so on... each layer keep moving up the pyramid

1. Initially, Singaporeans didn’t need to pay ABSD for second property. 
Then 5%, then 7%, then 12%.
 
2. BSD from 3% increased to 4%.
 
3. Carpark lot provision fell from 100% to 50-80%.
 
From a practical perspective, how much should property prices fall to compensate for these additional upfront costs and decline in material offering?
 
4. Land costs and construction costs has and will continue to escalate. 
 
Even for a charity developer who will charge 0 profits or even take a small loss, how low can it go???
 
How come these are not taken into consideration at all? Deliberately ignored, or just blind spot?

Ku Swee Yong has made so many erroneous predictions and assumptions that I have lost count.
 
You would do better in the property market following my posts from 2015.
 
He did not and would not analyse the whole market in complete contexts.

 
this Ku always talk down the market and I have to agree that he is quite off target. his view is the same as the property soul lady.

Seniors using their CPF to finance a home instead of saving the $$ for daily use after retirement..
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/older-hdb-flats-back-in-demand-after-cpf-rule-change
 

 
SINGAPORE - The demand for ageing Housing Board flats is on the rise, two months after the authorities changed Central Provident Fund (CPF) rules to expand the pool of people who can buy them.
Some 564 flats aged more than 40 years changed hands in May and June, up from 403 in the same period last year.
Transactions for flats between 30 and 40 years old rose 10.4 per cent to 1,219 units over the same period.
This means that older flats - those over 30 years old - made up 44.9 per cent of the total resale transactions in those two months, up from 40.6 per cent in 2018.
Ms Christine Sun, head of research at real estate agency OrangeTee & Tie, which compiled the data in its half-yearly report, said on Tuesday (Aug 6) that the second quarter usually sees more sales.
But the fact that resale transactions have also increased - by 5.6 per cent year on year - shows that "apart from a seasonal effect, the recent CPF changes may have been a major catalyst that has spurred buying demand last quarter".
 
 
Since May, buyers have been allowed to use more of their CPF monies and get bigger HDB loans for ageing flats, as long as the property's remaining lease covers the youngest buyers until the age of 95.

An example of buyer paying $2.05 million for a unit with 62 years lease balance, when could have gotten a brand new 99LH or FH of smaller size.
Could be enbloc millionaire as replacement home for the space, investor punting for future enbloc ... or both 
 
https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/resale-unit-nexus-reaps-122-mil-profit
 
 
Another example why ... 'go resale for better value' 
This unit TOP 13 years ago in 2006, lease (-13% years) sold 1.69mil 674psf compared to latest new EC with 99 years avg 1080psf more 'value' by (-37.5% psf) 
With no MOP or selling restrictions to foreigners aside, just look at the amount of space you get, more bang for the buck

2mil today is a low-middle quantum
most likely 60th percentile income type
 
if want to buy resale FH, 2mil cant get much space, maybe 1000-1100sqf
 
if new lh99 , 2mil got more choices and larger space as well, depending on location
but if you ask me, FH over lh99 anytime, for obvious reasons
 
If with only 2mil budget for property, rather than just being able to afford only 1 FH resale, and have all funds and risks tied to only one asset 
I would go for 2 LH resale, one own stay one rental/investment. 
 
Not only future may huat x2, with flexibility to stay/rent either or, spread risks while also staying more liquid to have option to sell either as and when if required.
 
As mentioned prior, both FH/LH pro and con, diff strokes diff folks, that's my take on it

Seniors using their CPF to finance a home instead of saving the $$ for daily use after retirement..
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/older-hdb-flats-back-in-demand-after-cpf-rule-change
Every other young couple getting married that I met recently are buying old flats. 
A 50K first time buyer grant and 20K grant for staying near parents mean they are getting 70K discount. Supposing they get a CCR or OCR 40 year old property for 500K, the actual property is only 400K or so. This was probably close to half the price they had to pay just a decade ago. Definitely sup!
 
I asked them whether they worry that the flat won’t last till they are 95. They don’t really mind. Maybe the VERS will come in before then.
 
As confirmed, HDBs are assets, but precise value depends on the proportion Govt allows to be recognised.
 
The lifeline, it seems, is more for the youngsters than for seniors!

depend on location, vers is no bao jiakif you buy old hdb hoping vers, you are as good as gambling, at this point no policy on vers payout and coverage, though leaders pointed out not as good as sers
 
for old hdb in town central near mrt, with more likely chance vers, may worth looking at
 
but for old hdb in ulu locations, more likely is a depreciating asset if no vers potential 
ie buy for own stay till $0 at 99th year
 
btw is interesting you lump 'ccr' 40yr hdb and 'ocr' 40yr hdb together and indicated both at same price range 500k
 
are you sure core central region 40yr hdb same price as outside central region 40yr hdb??? I wonder where you pluck your numbers from

VERS is just government taking back the HDB earlier and compensate the market rate, which can be already very depressed with about 10-30 years lease left.
 
To me, it is more of a mechanism for HDB to space out the redevelopment of more valuable plots of land in an orderly manner rather than to really benefit the owners.
 
The background is HDB built a lot of HDBs in the 1970s-1980s, therefore resources will be strained if these HDBs lease start to go to 0 within a time-span of 10-20 years.

What I meant was that nett, they pay something like 300K to 400K (after grants), which is near half of what they would have paid 10 years ago.
 
Central and prime flats in city areas, Outram, Marine Parade, Bukit Merah 4rm flats for example, routinely cross this price level in the early 2010s (700-800K).
 
Anyway, this trend of purchase of old resale flats is likely to continue as a viable strategy forward for the young as I believe HDB continues to fine tune the BTO building according to demand. The construction of new buildings will also slow down significantly due to a myriad of reasons I described in another post.

is more than thatis giving hdb resale market a hope that there is lifeline in a old lh99 hdb after 50yr
 
do you know why government announce this lifeline 20yr 'prematurely' 
 
it is to stabilize fears
the hdb is too big to fail, and the decaying issue is snow balling 
 
especially after 2017 enlightenment 
 
likewise for pte lh99, the lifeline is hope developer buy enbloc
 
however all these lifelines both pte and public is not applicable to every old lh99
 
not every hdb and not every old lh99 condo get buying interests 
 
only the selected few will get it, base on merits of location and future developments indicated in ura master plan

The Govt already explained that VERS is based on a resettlement scheme rather than profit based scheme.
 
It's like LUP or HIP programme, every flat will be in queue to receive this. The VERS payout will also be less generous than SERS because the flats that qualify for SERS in terms of density and size of sites, would be exhausted by then (20 years time). 
 
There is a need to space VERS carefully so that it will be sequential. It is also based on vote. From my sensing, very well located flats may reject VERS as the overall potential rental income may be higher than the payout Govt is willing to give, but largely also depends on where the Govt re-settles them. OCR are most likely to benefit, as rental does not appear as lucrative as voting for VERS and getting a new flat (anywhere might be equal or better than their current location).

Common sense lah bro. Why would youngsters go and buy OCR 40 years for 500K when prime places are selling below 500K, and new OCR is still under 500K? Maybe only 300-400K for those that are less than 20 years, 5rm.

Supposing they bought high for a 5rm flat, 39 years old at 800,000, 
 
Let's say they get to enjoy the prime location for another 30 years. I think the compensation at VERS should be say 300,000 to 500,000 (factoring in land inflation plus marginal value of old building with 30 years lease left). 300K to 500K may be enough for downgrade then (30 years later) in terms of size or location but unlikely to buy a new 5rm flat at the same locality.
 
I predict (blind prediction and guess) a new BTO 3rm flat in the same locality will be about 500K then, with 2rm at about 300K. This arrangement makes it easy for Govt to finance the resettlement. Their 5rm flat (space) is switched to 2 X 3rm or 2rm flat. One is sold back to owner (fresh lease or 30 - 99 years), the other is sold to a new buyer to finance the construction of new HDB blocks.
 
It's win-win or at worst, nobody loses. Bao Jiak or bueh pai jiak.
 
Remember that the survival of the future Govt depends on whether they get this right. Therefore, they will.

u mean a old hdb left 60yr price now 800k 
then use 30yr left final 30yr, price that time 300 to 500k say average 400k for easy calculation 
 
so per yr depreciation is 400k /30yr = 13k or 1k+ loss per month 
 
how on earth is old hdb a 'asset', when every month losing 1k+??? scratch head... 
 
and I doubt a old 69yr left 30yr 5room hdb is priced equal as a brand new 2room bto with full 99yr tenure in the future, if there is such a thing as brand new lh99 2room
 
more likely is government build "retirement village" with lh30 for senior citizens displaced by vers, there should be eligibility requirements eg age for such housing 
 
lh99 bto is for married youngeters gainfully employed and will be priced higher than "retirement village" lh30 for obvious reasons, and likely bigger units to encourage youngsters to start family
 
although tiagong some people said no need much room to start family...

One method to lessen the impact is to compensate at market value of new flat.
 
Says one buys a new 5 room flat now at bto price of 400k. (2019)
 
In 50 years time, say if it's 1.08 mil for a new 5 room bto in the same area then (e.g. 2% pa compounded), the govt may compensate 50% of that value at 540k under Vers, meaning a slower appreciation of only 0.6% p.a. for the initial 400k but at least it doesn't run to 0. 
 
This may be similar to what is currently done under lease buyback, which isn't very popular as market value falls. The one I'm proposing here is tagged to new HDB flat instead, not the market value of an old flat as what's currently done.
 
The elderly owners may choose to downsize and buy a 2 bedroom with some balance cash left, as they probably need lesser room and at the same time, the government can take back the units and provide for new couples who need more space.

The alternative to living in prime area (5rm size) is to rent for 30 years. One family would end up paying upwards of 3K plus per month plus 2% annual inflation for 30 years. 
Another way to see the actual asset value is to rent out the HDB for 30 years.
 
Lastly, do remember that the first buyers paid merely 50K for their flat when they bought it. For them, it is still a huge appreciation.
 
We will know in 20 years.

Assets can depreciate, especially if one chooses to overpay to begin with. But they are still valuable because people can derive value from them.
 
If your definition of assets is they cannot depreciate, then no way can our thoughts reconcile.

The examples I shared to begin with were young people buying prime HDB units for 300-400+K.
 
Then I was told to comment how about those who bought at 30% higher than recent prices. If the buyers buy at 800K or over 1 million, they have to be pragmatic that at the end of the day, the Govt cannot compensate them the whole sum, or any other unit will have to be similarly compensated.
 
The only option they have is to opt against VERS. Then they get to depreciate it to 0.
 
But such cases were the exception rather than the rule.

after all, senior citizens displaced from vers likely are unwilling to buy brand new lh99 that costs more than lh30 given same sqf
 
i suppose they need more cash for Healthcare rather than to spend cash onlh99 for longer tenure, plus doubt they can get loan for lh99 housing which cost more than lh30

to me this LH and FH debate depends a LOT on the enbloc rules and regulation. Previous years, the enbloc is so lucrative that there isn't really a penalty for buying LH. 
 
I do think that previous rules are too lenient on the developers allowing them to reap huge profits from enbloc and thus able to bid astronomical prices for LH land. 
 
There is no successful residential enbloc for over a year? As this drags on, the pressure will be on the LH owners to reduce the selling price as clock is ticking down for them. 
 
I am curious when we will see a successful enbloc and at what psf.
successful enbloc in 2019?have lah

Firstly, I said they are savvy based on their education levels and occupation. I don't think I stated they were savvy because they bought old HDBs. If you have been here long enough, you know I am an advocate for private property.
 
Second, I never said LH99 are or are not depreciating. And if you saw the original quoted prices, the buyers of old HDB resale unit will not lose anything at the end of the day when VERS comes.
 
The ones who actually lose are those who paid 30% above market value, based on your question of those who chose to do so.But I recognise the value in HDBs and also understand why some people choose to buy it (at valuation or below valuation prices).
 
You can twist people's words and roll on the floor laughing but actually you know the drama is all self-created.

She has some good points in her research no doubt but really over analyzed and generally always against the market due to her earlier success, back in 2014 she was already saying market peaked somewhat and was expecting a downtrend.

Sale of Older HDB Flats Up 40% From Last Year
 

More Older Flat Sold in Q2 2019
 
According to the Business Times, 564 flats that are aged 40 years or above were sold between May to June this year. This is 40 per cent higher than the same time last year (403 transactions). There was also a 10.4 per cent increase in transactions for resale flats between 30 to 40 years old, with 1,219 units changing hands.
 
To put things in context, this wasn’t just an isolated rush for older flats. The volume of resale transactions also spiked almost 30 per cent between Q1 and Q2 of this year (6,726 transactions). The volume of older flats – 40 years or above – account for only about eight per cent of the transactions.

My Resale Flat Journey: First Property is a 30-Year Old Resale Flat
 

About The Flat
 
Location Jurong West
Flat Price $335,000 (after $40,000 housing grants)
Year of Purchase 2018
Flat Type & Size 5-room flat/ 121 sqm
Remaining Length of Lease 69 years (as of May 2019)
Monthly Mortgage Amount & Loan Tenure About $1,600 18 years
Renovation Cost About $35,000
 
MS: We understand that your flat is about 30 years old. Was its age a concern for you?
 
One reason why I bought a resale flat is that it is more spacious for my family. This flat is about 120 sqm and the kids have more space to run around. Sometimes my parents or my wife’s parents will visit. So it’s better to have more space.
 
We still have 69 years left on the lease which is good enough for us. Our children and future generations are likely to buy their own homes anyway, so we don’t need to worry about leaving this flat for them. As we are planning to use this flat as a home, I think it’s good enough. For the next generation, you don’t need to bother as the kids will buy their own homes.
 
Although this is an old estate, the area is well taken care of by the Town Council and HDB alao carries out upgrading of the flats.
 
 
MS: Do you see your flat as an investment?
 
When we were weighing the pros and cons of buying a 30-year-old flat compared to a newer one, we did think about this issue. However, we feel that a house is for the long-term and one that would see us through our old age. Instead of hoping to make a profit from moving houses, we would rather stay in one flat and finish paying our housing loan sooner, so that we can free up our finances for other things.

I know a lot of people have the same mentality as above. When they are in their  early 30s, they look at their current finances and think that if they want to enjoy a spacious flat, then they have to go for an old flat because that's what their affordability level is.
 
Problem is when pple reach their 40s, they would have grown their income and savings.  And human has tendency for greed in wealth. When they grow wealthier, they want even more money, and  it become painful when their biggest investment is either not making money or may even be depreciating.  They will not be thinking the same like when they were in their 30s.  To add fuel to fire, their friends in their 40s, may have already make some good profit in their property investment, but it is not working out for them. 
 
In my daily business, it become very clear to me that property investment, like anything else in life, is either you "suffer" first in the beginning and enjoy later in the future years or you take a comfortable path in the beginning and then you "suffer" later in the future years. There is simply no escape from this....whether it is career, marriage, education, investments, etc.....it is the same.

For some, the upbringing and culture makes them unwilling to view their home as investment. 
Nothing wrong, especially if they are concerned about job stability and can use the current site for their work purposes.
 
They are also “guaranteed” of a new comparable site (unknown BTO pricing) 20 or 30 years down the road.
 
There are still some pros. Although I personally would stretch for a private, not everyone agrees.

When they grow wealthier, they want even more money, and  it become painful when their biggest investment is either not making money or may even be depreciating.  They will not be thinking the same like when they were in their 30s.  To add fuel to fire, their friends in their 40s, may have already make some good profit in their property investment, but it is not working out for them. 
 
In my daily business, it become very clear to me that property investment, like anything else in life, is either you "suffer" first in the beginning and enjoy later in the future years or you take a comfortable path in the beginning and then you "suffer" later in the future years. There is simply no escape from this....whether it is career, marriage, education, investments, etc.....it is the same.

My Resale Flat Journey: First Property is a 30-Year Old Resale Flat
 
 
a fortune teller with self proclaim track records since 2015 say a old 69yr hdb bought say 800k today may drop half of its value to 400k in 30yr ie $1.1k loss per month
 
using the fortune teller example this jurong west 69yr old hdb bought 2018 should drop to 165k in 2048 ,no? 
mean 165k/30yr/12mth is only loss $450 pm 
cheaper than rental of 1 bedroom!!! 
then remaining 39yr is left 165k lagi cheap only loss $350 pm!!! cheaper than monthly car petrol 
 
no wonder fortune teller say old hdb is call 'asset' lah

The other aspect of things is also happening in my circle. People in 30s chasing the elite lifestyle thinking their potential will keep increasing as they progress. When reach middle age, perspective of life change and grew out of chasing the high life. But since already committed and not so simple to just exit, what to do but to keep quiet and slog on.

Sale of Older HDB Flats Up 40% From Last Year
 
 
this report say old hdb about 40yr age which is left 60yr tenure average transactions price at 330k  
compare this to a brand new 5room bto which is price about 350k to 400k+ in ocr, would you want to save a meagre 50k to buy a resale 40yr old hdb?
 
if you compare to a resale of new unit just 5yr old, ie left 94yr. the resale is average 150k more than bto price
 
using the same example if a 5yr old 5room bought at ulu location at 350k from hdb in 2014 then resale at 500k today , from 94yr to 60yr is difference equal 500k - 330k =170k, ie 34yr difference is worth 170k, so per mth is $420, similar to the 69yr jurong west resale hdb example posted earlier
 
however this depreciation is true only for old hdb up to 40yr age
 
tiagong the older a lh99 gets, say above 60yr or 70yr, the depreciation may shoot up at a much sharper rate, but currently no past data to support such speculation
 
so now all waiting for the vers lifeline

I have a friend who grew up in a modest environment 
But she’s now used to servants, the good life etc. so much so that when we have gatherings there must be someone to fetch her over and there must be air conditioning 
So when we eat hawker food, we eat it at a restaurant 
Luckily the husband can support this lifestyle..

past 2 yr from 2Q2017 to now, lh99 resale market is going through a downward correction
 
still trying to find the new support level
 
nowadays some resale value drop as much as 30% compare to pre2017 Enlightenment
eg some 'savvy' people who bought few yr ago at 30% higher than current pricing, too bad now is holding to hot potato

yes sir, stability vs risks, no risk no gain is the rule of the game 
some people content with hdb, some resign to fate treat the depreciating lh99 as rental 
 
some people take risks end up the property appreciation lead to not only stay for free but extra pocket money to spend when enbloc or resale at higher pricing
 
some need to suffer, while some enjoy from start to end

I agree, but in a few months or years, this could be considered a bargain.. remember the AMK Hub? There was a 99 LH condo next to it, priced at 1000 psf, and many mocked the high price... now, 1000 psf can't even buy a place in Punggol...

Unfortunately, a lot of pple are not savvy in investment instruments. They know a bit about stocks, unit trust, REITs etc...but they don't have time to manage the portfolio themselves. As a result, most buy into unit trust or ILP where over time, the management fees erode their returns . Or they dwell into stocks, didn't monitor and then ended up with half of what they begin with. In the end, most average consumers conclude that either the fund managers are sneaky or other investments are simply too risky for them.
 
Hence the only viable investment most average pple have is their home. So my take is that if the home is your only possible investment, then please make it a sound one especially when one is still young. Like all investments, younger age is a big advantage because of the long investment horizon for compounding returns.  Work hard, take a bit more risk and don't settle for comfort when one is still young (early 30s). There is plenty of time for comfort and low risk investments when one is old.
 
This is not to say all young pple must stretch their budget for their home, but they can make sacrifices for sound property  investment principle. For example sacrifice space for better location. Or sacrifice space for a newer home where the chances of capital appreciation is higher. Property is the biggest investment for most pple, so whether they look at it as a roof over their head, or just a home to sleep at night, it is still their biggest spending so make it a sound one where it can grow over time.

Anything property bought in the 80s would have had some appreciation by now..  even the HDB leasesvery true but also need to factor in inflation  
over 30yr, value of money probably eroded by 3x or more, ie an item in 80s cost $1 probably today cost $3 or more 
 
so if a new bto can be bought from hdb at say $100k 30yr ago, today a new bto if cost $300k+ actually is just inflation at work, no actual price increase
 
is as good as coffee cost 40cents 30yr ago, now is $1.20

Was that even sales talk? Sorry I don't realise it as I am just giving honest sharing base on experience and observations.
 
BTW I do have separate property and other investment like stocks, ILP, unit trust, etc.  But I started those when I was 18. So I am not dissing other products, please don;t get me wrong because I have those as well, but from what I observe in the average consumer group, most don't because they either got burn before, or they heard of some bad experiences from friends and didnt want to dabble into it.

The best situation to get into is of course to have a rich inheritance from Daddy. FH and Everyday balonglong Jiak kangkong.
 
The real situation is complex though. 
 
People have different priorities. New sales prices are high and near new property tracks them closely.
 
But an old FH / 999LH may not meet one’s demand. Perhaps it is a new matrimonial home. Certainly new trumps old, and with much fewer renovation items to settle.
 
Not everyone is aiming for investment gains. Some people treat it wholly as an expense.

Unless you are filthy rich, like what icedbs said, if your first home is a bad investment, everyone will regret it later.
 
To me, and I most of us, the first home is the BIGGEST purchase in our lives. With so much money involved, it is wise to make sure it is a good investment.
 
That is why I say if this current trend of depreciating HDB continues... a lot of HDB buyers is going to be pissed off. Unless you make HDB so cheap that it does not take up a big chunk of their pay...

True, but the maintenance fees for an old property could be sky high and some of the facilities may not be able to be used. I went before to an old property for a Birthday party, where the children swam in the pool. Several of them had deep cuts in their soles due to the tiles coming off the floor of the pool. 
End of the day, each buys for slightly different or even very different reasons.

The owner really huat big time, almost 100% appreciation in ~10 years!!
 
Boon Keng 5-room HDB flat sells for record $1.2 million in July, but resale prices dip 0.2%
 

 
SINGAPORE - Despite a Boon Keng five-roomer selling for a record sum, HDB resale prices remained pretty much stable last month, new figures show.
 
The 39th-floor unit at City View@ Boon Keng went for $1,205,000 - $5,000 more than the previous record for a HDB resale set by a five-room flat in Boon Tiong Road, in Tiong Bahru, in April.
 
It was the second time this year that a City View unit has claimed the record after another five-room unit in the adjacent Block 9 sold for $1,185,000 in January.
 

The 714-unit development was completed in 2011, and five of the nine flats there sold this year have gone for over a million dollars.
 
Analysts say it has proved popular because it is a new development located among ageing counterparts in a mature estate and in close proximity to two MRT stations - Bendemeer on the Downtown Line and Boon Keng on the North-East Line.
 
Despite that record price, HDB resale prices in July decreased by 0.2 per cent from June, although the number of resale transactions went up by 11.9 per cent, according to data released by SRX Property on Thursday (Aug 8).
 
The prices of three-room and five-room flats fell by 0.9 and 0.1 per cent respectively.
 
Four-room prices remained flat while prices for executive flats saw an increase of 0.3 per cent.
 
Non-mature estate prices increased by 0.2 per cent while mature estate flats were 0.8 per cent lower.
 

"What we are seeing in mature estates on one end is the value of older flats beginning to dip as the flats age, and on the other newer flats like those at City View starting to enter the resale market at higher prices," said property agent OrangeTee & Tie's head of research and consultancy Christine Sun.
 
The highest transaction price for a non-mature estate resale flat last month was for an executive flat in Hougang which sold for $908,000. Overall, resale prices were 0.8 per cent lower than in July last year.
 
There were 2,120 resale transactions last month, up from 1,895 in June. This was 17 per cent lower than in July last year, but 19.7 per cent higher than the average volume in July for the last five years.
 
The increased sales volume can be attributed to a number of factors, said Ms Sun.
 
"Sales activities usually pick up after the June holidays," she added.
 
"Demand for resale flats, especially older units, may have increased after the recent CPF rule changes that allow buyers to use more of their CPF savings as well as get bigger HDB loans for older flats.
 
"But prices may remain weak due to the increasing supply of flats that have reached MOP (minimum occupation period), with more sellers vying for buyers."
 
SRX estimated in its report that 680 flats could enter the resale market within the next three months as these units approach their five-year MOP.
 
The overall median transaction over X-value (TOX) was negative $1,000 last month, a decrease of $1,000 from the previous month.
 
The median TOX measures whether people are overpaying (positive TOX) or underpaying (negative TOX) relative to the SRX Property X-value estimated market value for flats.
 
Only three-room flats had a positive median TOX of $2,000 last month. Four-room, five-room and executive flats saw a median TOX of negative $1,000, negative $1,000 and negative $7,000 respectively.
 
Kallang Whampoa saw the highest median TOX of $18,000.

True, but the maintenance fees for an old property could be sky high and some of the facilities may not be able to be used. I went before to an old property for a Birthday party, where the children swam in the pool. Several of them had deep cuts in their soles due to the tiles coming off the floor of the pool.
 
End of the day, each buys for slightly different or even very different reasons.
sway ah

aging properties are a pain regardless hdb, lh99, lh999 or fh
 
while there is still an option of rebuild for landed properties subject to the individual owner's pocket size but for apartments....good luck if there is no rejuvenation plan for that development in the absence of an enbloc deal
 
 
fh no worry to retain value for generation after generation, both condo or landedin fact not just retain value but keep appreciate value 
 
even if no enbloc or rebuilt the value of fh do not go to zero
 
lh99 on the other hand whether is condo or landed is next generation can witness $0 at 99th year liao, keep depreciating till pants drop if no enbloc or rebuilt
 
that's why more and more people buy FH

I have a friend who grew up in a modest environment
But she’s now used to servants, the good life etc. so much so that when we have gatherings there must be someone to fetch her over and there must be air conditioning
So when we eat hawker food, we eat it at a restaurant
Luckily the husband can support this lifestyle..

LH or FH is better depends on what one is looking for. If one wants a good location but only can afford LH, why not? It is not always abt value, sometimes it is the quality of life.
 
Have a look at ICON(Gopeng). I am amazed why there is still pp willing to buy a loft unit at more than 1m when it is 12 years old.
 
FH indeed has advantage over LH over the same area if one can afford. But give me a good location LH over a bad location FH anytime.

I know a lot of people have the same mentality as above. When they are in their  early 30s, they look at their current finances and think that if they want to enjoy a spacious flat, then they have to go for an old flat because that's what their affordability level is.
 
Problem is when pple reach their 40s, they would have grown their income and savings.  And human has tendency for greed in wealth. When they grow wealthier, they want even more money, and  it become painful when their biggest investment is either not making money or may even be depreciating.  They will not be thinking the same like when they were in their 30s.  To add fuel to fire, their friends in their 40s, may have already make some good profit in their property investment, but it is not working out for them. 
 
In my daily business, it become very clear to me that property investment, like anything else in life, is either you "suffer" first in the beginning and enjoy later in the future years or you take a comfortable path in the beginning and then you "suffer" later in the future years. There is simply no escape from this....whether it is career, marriage, education, investments, etc.....it is the same.
I do not subscribe to the notion, must suffer first or later. As with most things, key is to know how to strike a balance. 
While human tendency to lust after $$$, should also learn to have some contentment and appreciate what already have.
 
If wanna compare, then never ending story. From HDB to Condo to Landed to GCB. One mountain highet than the other, can never reach the peak.
 
As mentioned prior, HDB is meant for own stay roof over head, should not be taken solely as investment tool.
 
Those that went the BTO route, when saved enough for DP, then go for investment property and let time do its thing. 
Most likely the property will pay for itself via rental and also capital appreciation in due course.
 
As with any investment to create wealth, should not let it compromise lifestyle, YOLO. 
Other much more important stuff should take priority ... health happiness etc.

You enjoy twisting words. 
 
HDB flats are well maintained in most cases. But by the 50 yr mark, regardless of the level of maintenance, some things will be old:
Lifts, plumbing, wires, power supplies etc
The same applies to condos. But HDBs can be even more well looked after as the government won't want to lose their voters. 
 
We should use HDB flats as the gold standard since most folks live in them. 
 
But how much radical renovations is required for these 50-60 year old homes to remain liveable? 
 
Do you have an issue with your flat and an image problem? ð
i don’t have an issue with my hdb flat or an image problem.

I agree with what you say.  Problem is, after seeing their parents generation making boatloads of money from their HDB, do you think it is easy for the current generation to accept that HDB is  just a roof over their head and it is perfectly fine if they don't make a cent out of it?  
 
Some of my post offers insights and general observations which I see or hear everyday.  They are meant to give  the hard truth so that forumers know what may happen if they only see what they want now but not what could be ahead.  
 
Anyway, due to my very limited time these days, I will not be able to post as often.  Those who have questions, PM me and I will answer them whenever I can.  Enjoy the national day and long weekend.......will be a very busy time for me though.

We generally suffer from confirmation bias.
 
People who continuously watch the public-private gap think it has to remain.
 
Those who only think of FH as the sole criteria of a property’s value will absorb only data that confirm their thinking.
 
Regarding whether youngsters feel if they should make money out of HDB, my suspicion is they either choose to not think about it, or they make corresponding pragmatic choices. When some of my young relatives sold their HDBs, they did so in an instant. Just 100k gain from the sale of BTO flat (barely over breakeven considering the renovations), they sold.
 
Look across history, and we can see a very dynamic picture of Singapore that is amenable to change in an instant. There are no fixed rules. More crucial is which direction things should go to benefit everybody at a social level.

I'm not sure if it's just me but I think you are nagging too much on the freehold part. From this, I can kind of guess your age.  
I agree on the virtues of a freehold property but I don't feel that one has to stress that on almost every post?!
 
I think if someone does that to me in real life.. oh no one actually does that in real life except for my grandparents who had dementia.
 
But off my mind, some ways for you to satisfy that urge without becoming annoying:
1. Put it as your signature. Maybe make it invisible.
2. Put it as your profile picture
3. Change your username to freehold2019to8

I used to think nothing else but only FH until I started seriously looking around years ago. Now I am more open-minded to LH, perhaps the same open-mindedness to FH.
 
Cheap FH are usually of poor location. Good FH are often very expensive with very poor yield. Not all LH are bad. NOT all FH are good. I like stats but I like real life cases more. Ask and ask around more from friends, relatives and colleagues to make our own conclusion. Sometimes forum-ers have their own agenda in their posts.

maybe is because lh99 is cheaper? fh are more expensive 

Realistically speaking, i would probably take a cheaper FH in a poor location (since due to where i work and my kids go to school). My expectation is that must have more living space or peace and quiet since it's for self stay only. I'm not really bothered much by convenience to amenities.
 
But this is probably dinosaur thinking

One of my colleague is looking to exit from his resale FH condo acquired in 2017. Of course there is SSD to consider. His reason: rental yield too low for him. He might find better yielding instrument.
 
Another one acquired a new LH at same time in decent area getting, to him, a decent rental yield of 3+% now. With expectation of limited upside cap appreciation from now. Holding it for now.

I do not intend to respond but have no choice. 
DON'T put words in my mouth. I DID NOT mention he is forced to sell. He is looking at better investment instrument. Those who have been in this tread will know that I am referring to the same colleague that went for Finland and Japan hiking trip AFTER completing this FH transaction.  He is now even considering retiring in next few years and he is not even 1/2 century old. Small head? I let readers decide.

Need a house in Sg. Is either rent or buy. But with a kid prefer to buy so that no need to keep moving. Just a need. Got something below 1 mil FH 3 pools. Kid happy to run around the garden and no longer need to move after lease ended. Met good friends and play daily. I think can buy any time if it is a need as long as not very high price and comfortably afford. There is always willing seller in the market.

If for investment, the holding power as well as the exit plan is more important.... LH and FH alike. With a well executed plan, a LH does not loose to FH.
 
If talk about long term hold long long,....THE FH one will of course win hands down. But as said before, it is how you execute than matter that is more important.

Yep, if you have the acumen, even a 30 yr lease can be a good investment..
Timing, location and price are paramount. There's no easy money. Do your money and reap the rewards of your research.
 
The usual basic principles still apply. 
 
And unless there's a war or major recession with significant retrenchment, if the economy chugs along, the prices will continue their lofty march..

But with the current low interest rate environment and looking set to go even lower, I would leverage and put the funds to better use investing into returns higher than bank interest. (eg div stocks)

I agree with what you say.  Problem is, after seeing their parents generation making boatloads of money from their HDB, do you think it is easy for the current generation to accept that HDB is  just a roof over their head and it is perfectly fine if they don't make a cent out of it?

Thanks for agreeing 
 
I feel it would be naive to think that the high gains of the past to be mirrored future. The property investment climate have changed, one mainly being CMs since 2009 putting a curb to the pace of rise in property prices, and ABSD which is not just a big hurdle during purchase, also eating into future profits.
 
That said, this is Expensive SG, property remain a sound investment option, just that now one need to have a longer term horizon.
 
And that is also why its 'good to be in as early as possible'  before prices get out of reach.

The BTO should never be sold from investment perspective. The rental yield is the best among residential properties.  If one is qualified to buy, BTO should be the 1st property.

I am pretty sure this is not the best way... i agree with some of the others that if u can squeeze the Budget, go for ec.
 
The fact is that bto plus mop basically locks you out of the market for at least 8 years. Same for ec. 
 
This is true in the past even when hdb resale market was hot. With the declining resale hdb market..

Sometimes old resales HDB is the only ticket to a great location if affordability is a genuine issue.As mentioned prior, HDB for own stay. 
So not just for oneself but also family members as well, location convenience with ease of access to amenities and public transport to be priority.

If one is qualified to buy, BTO should be the 1st property.I do agree, generally young couples should start off with BTO. But in order to rent, would need to have another stay property, currently got ABSD to content with. 
If affordability non issue, can also fast track via the EC/PTE route new or resale.
 
Ideally, to own at least two, either BTO-PTE or both PTE.

Wanna know how much the agent comms for new launches? 
 
https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/real-estate/developers-dangle-higher-commissions-to-clear-less-ideal-units
Developers dangle higher commissions to clear less ideal units
 
(They can go up to 3-4%; cash bonus may also be thrown in for ground floor or less-attractive facing units)
 

In today's market, agents expect developers to pay a minimum of 2.3 per cent commission for them to be motivated to clear any project.
 
"And for a boutique project, to get the visibility up, the commissions must be higher than 2.3 per cent."
 
Such higher commissions are more prevalent for higher-end projects, where there are relatively fewer buyers of such properties with large price quantums.
 
"Buying sentiment seems to have returned to the market, so it's a good time (for developers) to capitalise on this to lock in sales," 
 
SL Capital's Sky Everton is offering commissions of up to 3 per cent, while the Affinity at Serangoon - developed by a consortium led by Oxley Holdings - is said to be offering up to 3.7 per cent.
 
The commission for The Florence Residences by Logan Property is understood to be 1.8 per cent but there are additional cash incentives - which can range from S$5,000 to S$20,000 - for certain units.
 
However, there are also instances where developers are offering commissions under 2 per cent. This could be due to expectations of strong demand for the project.
 
Frasers Property's luxury development Rivière is understood to be offering a commission of 1.8 per cent, while the commission for City Development Limited and TID's EC Piermont Grand is said to be around 0.9 per cent.

The coastal belt from West Coast to Tanjong Pagar will see greater demand in residential projects over the next 5 years due to the Tuas port and Jurong East developments.  Towards the East, Simei to Changi Road North look good as T5 will have sustained growth over the next few decades.  Perhaps in 10 years' time, our private property prices and sizes will match Hong Kong.

Not with the recent private development minimum size stipulations. Even CCR areas that qualify to build this size won’t, as that would be disproportionately bigger size allocated to other units.

Dual key units may be able to skirt this restriction, allowing one to stay in one unit while renting out the studio and avoiding the ABSD.

But I personally feel that people who buy such large units are unlikely to want to share it with tenants?
 
I feel developers might still prefer to allocate more equally to minimise risk.

Different entrances for dual key. Easy to collect rent and monitor tenant as the unit is just next door.

Much will still depend on landlord and tenant preference and demand, but it’s defintiely one possibility for future trends. Dual key has proven to be largely successful in many developments as well.

It will be like their life is monitored by the landlord. If the dual key is rented out to 2 tenants, it may be a different story.  
I may be wrong and bros here can correct me if you have rented out your dual key easily while staying beside it.

I do see a demand for dual key units as society ages. I know of pp who have bought dual key so that the couple can live just beside their aging parents and take care of them while not  staying together.

Still left 50 years lease, consider quite long before these area can be redeveloped.    Actually these HDB terraces take up lots of space, i saw those terraces in Jalan Bahagia, due to these flats scatter around the road, the road there cannot be widen and realigned.    Queenstown HDB terraces still ok since the flats did not affected the roads there so much.

But not easy to pass the RES exams leh.....
 
Heard only top 20% can pass
 
My friend got a degree from NUS also fail..... 
 
Wonder what it takes to pass? Anyone can share tips?

 
I am not sure what tips you need, but like all exams, you just need to study real hard for it. 
 
The syllabus itself is not tough, but I feel a lot of candidates are taking this while having some other jobs and totally underestimated the paper.  When I took this exam,  I prepared for it full time. 
 
Memory work will not be enough to pass this exam.  You can memorise the entire HDB & URA website and still fail in this paper  The exam test your application knowledge and it is hard when the candidate has not even been an agent yet! So your knowledge + logical deduction & reasoning has to be very strong. The section on answering 2 case studies would probably killed a lot of candidates.
 
The only advise I can give is practice the model exam questions like you have never done before in your entire education life. If you think you had enough of the practice, do another 50 questions more. Never underestimate this paper even if you are a lawyer or doctor.
 
This is probably one of the toughest industry certification exam to pass today.  If you are thinking of joining this line for the money, then look elsewhere. There are less agonising way to make money.  You need to be really passionate about serving home-owners where their pain is your pain and their investment success is your only measurement of achievement & fulfillment.  Otherwise, you will be happier with your corporate job.

	Our economy has unexpected made a very sharp U-turn this year.  My guess is potential buyers will be holding back very large purchases such as property this year and next year.

Using the comparable sale method, Cushman & Wakefield VHS valued the property – on the basis of market value – at $87 million, while Knight Frank valued it at $85.5 million using the direct comparison method.
 
Based on the property’s independent valuations, the average market value is about $86.25 million. As such, the $95 million consideration is 10.1 percent higher than the average market value.

Hmmmm ... interesting NDP Rally. PM seems to say that the likelihood of flooding is NOT IF but WHEN. The pics he showed were fairly alarming ... it seems that the Sentosa Cove, Downtown, up to Novena and whole East Coast area at risk of flooding so though steps are being taken the risk is there like raising the area. Will that affect one's decision to purchase properties in these areas cos these are where quite a few prime new developments are albeit 50-100 years risk?

We are just a tiny island that is at high risk of being submerged when global warming (melting of ice caps) plus tide / weather conditions combine. We have seen that a few times in several places in SG. The incidents will only increase in frequency. It doesn't affect any one location specifically but many / all locations in SG.
 
We need indeed to start working on this early. Our (small) size may play to our advantage though. Fortifying an island will be costly (100 billion as stated by PM), but it will be many (hundred or thousand) folds for larger countries.
 
If any country has the will and the resources to do it ultimately, it has to be Singapore.

Agree. Many parts of singapore are in low lying land. Fortifying the island is important but have to see which is the most effective and affordable method. We also have to work on how to deal with drainage cos the usual gravity method will not work if the sea level out the fortification is higher than the land mass (such problem is already showing in many cities when there is prolong heavy rain or unusually heavy rain).

I thought the NDR makes Punggol even less attractive, because the next BIG THING is the SOUTH, and Punggol is furthest thing from the Great Southern Waterfront. In fact, one wonders if the Punggol Digital District (not even mentioned much during the NDR) is ever going to take shape, esp when the Googles and other cool tech companies are already there close to the Southern Waterfront.

Agreed. I thought the idea of the poulders and dykes is quite smart and interesting. By using dykes out at sea to pump out the water, creating low lying dry land (lower than sea level but protected by the dykes), we will create new dry land along the eastern shoreline without having to buy loads of expensive sand - definitely more economical than reclaiming land. From a property investment perspective, in the mid to long term, those East Coast sea facing condos will be impacted. in the first place, these East Coast condos are already quite far away from the sea separated by the noisy ECP. Now the sea will move even further out. Just Tekong using this method is creating 2 Toa Payohs. Can't imagine how far out the poulders are going to be for the mainland. 
 
The good news is the majority of these "owners" of East Coast condos are foreigners - can't help every time I go Tg Rhu or Meyer or Mandarin Gardens or even Changi Business Park,  there are more Indian NRI people than locals.

Don't know. Probably human nature who wants to be around people of the same race / type / culture. Even Mandarin Gardens is now known as "Mumbai Gardens". Not only that, they also take over the MC in many of these condos. But it has helped spur the condo prices in the area.

The idea of adding 9000 units to the Keppel area has many implications 
So will they be government HDB or EC
Or will they be private
 
If they are HDB then at one fell stroke the popularity of units in Punggol, Seng Kang and even the new paya lebar areas may become less popular. Given their connectivity issues in the northeast, the property value may plummet. 
Likewise those telok blangah flats will suffer with newer flats that have better views. 
 
If they are solely private then it’s also going to affect prices of older flats near HarbourFront and even newer ones like the Interlace
 
The draw to stay in town and pay high prices will be less. Those surrounding super expensive condos with less than 90 year lease will drop in price if the new ones are priced lower. 
 
The west coast highway may become busy. 
Henderson road will also become crowded. 
VivoCity stands to benefit big time and rental there may rise. 
 
Further down the road, in the quieter areas near train stations, units there stand to benefit from the GSW. 
But more ulu places like Whistler and Clematis may face competition and buyers will be drawn to these new ones in time and the upside for these units will be lower. 
 
Condos surrounding the Mapletree and the new PSA buildings will benefit greatly. 
Houses in the area will get more shops, recreational areas etc do its an exciting time for the belt from Pasir Panjang to Haw Par 
 
All in all, very exciting indeed..
More eateries, shops and parks sounds like all good news
Also if a recession comes buyers may hold fire and as the units surrounding the new Keppel area get older they will lose value and make it cheaper for buyers to get a unit. 
The government can build HDB units there at AMK prices and there will still be takers.

The year that area is more or less ready with 9000 units is 2040 to even 2050. 
Most of the developments you mentioned will be at enbloc stage then.
 
From now until then, a whole lifetime of work and activity still needs to be committed, along with an acute short term supply crunch.

At the stroke of a plan, it will make some winners today become losers tomorrow and vice versa. 
 
And with climate change suddenly the talk of town, a supposedly freehold goldmine can also become a worthless mangrove swamp. Since so many foreigners vested here, should tax them heavily to foot the bill for the walls.

Also, need to consider how much more expensive these new buildings will be, with land cost, construction cost, and extra climate change consideration and features  in these premium developments.
 
9000 units is also only a drop in the bucket, only a year’s supply. In the 20, 30 years, really not much to mention.

Another point for consideration is that each area will have its own distinctive ecosystem. 
 
GSW will be positioned as recreational, ultra premium and luxury seafront living. It’s highly possible for HDB lease here to be 30LH, 45LH or 60LH.
 
West is educational and manufacturing; east is recreational and cultural; North has its own industrial  and residential region.
 
Each sector may have its own distinctive pricing structure as well.

Many questions to ponder
HDB flats there will be controversial.. 
do you price it much higher?
Or just a bit more than average and the owner who manages to get one will be a lottery winner sitting on a huge windfall immediately?
Or go totally private and the entire area gets priced at lofty prices? 2500 psf maybe?
9000 units will be more than what hillview currently has, so will it be too much? 
Maybe some units won’t get any sea views and the entire area ends up being very cramped? I’ve been to the club and whilst there’s space, it’s not that massive like Paya Lebar..
Will there be a lot of choke points like Punggol?
Will the circle line suddenly be packed?

Today, only some HDB resale are hitting the 1mil mark or above
Future, even new BTO also ..... 'no 1mil no talk' !!! 
 
Huat ah!

HDB flats on prime Keppel Club site: Premium prices or tweaked sales terms?
 
(Consultant sees new 5-room unit there at close to S$1m; Lawrence Wong had previously suggested different sales terms for future city flats)
 

expects the HDB to launch Build-to Order (BTO) flats on the site at close to S$1 million for a five-room unit, "so one can expect that the resale prices, when the time comes, will be even higher".
 
Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong in 2016, when he disclosed that the government could look at selling future public housing in the city under a different model - such as by imposing a longer MOP, a lease shorter than the existing 99 years, or a higher resale levy - to address the lottery effect.

Don't know. Probably human nature who wants to be around people of the same race / type / culture. Even Mandarin Gardens is now known as "Mumbai Gardens". Not only that, they also take over the MC in many of these condos. But it has helped spur the condo prices in the area. 
 
They even monopolise / control the MCs of condos where they are just a small minority. Because our apathetic Sinkies allow them to do so.

The year that area is more or less ready with 9000 units is 2040 to even 2050.
 
Most of the developments you mentioned will be at enbloc stage then.
 
From now until then, a whole lifetime of work and activity still needs to be committed, along with an acute short term supply crunch.

 
ya, the keppel plan is at least 10-15 years in the making. who knows what will happen then.
 
then there is the huge tract of land at paya lebar airbase.
 
one thing is for sure... 10M here we come. else build so many units for ghost to stay ah?

So many extra land coming up to develop and build residential, no wonder they can allow so many old flats to rot until the 99 years lease is up and no need to tear them down to make way for new residential?!

I’m hopeful we reserve some land to give space for recreational stuff. 
Stack them high yes but then have space for CC, football etc
Maybe we will have a new mall or sports centre like a sea sports area at the GSW?

https://www.99.co/blog/singapore/singaporeans-its-time-we-stop-whining-about-property-prices/
Singaporeans, it’s time we stop whining about property prices
 
One top Singaporean gripe of buying a property on this Sunny Island set in the Sea is that housing prices are too darn expensive these days. But do their complaints really hold water? Are we as a nation of homebuyers too picky, unrealistic, or downright delusional? Or do we have a legitimate right to whine? Here 99.co’s take in five silence-inducing points.

#1: We are too aspirational
 
Gone are the days when Singaporeans would be content about buying a home and be satisfied with living in their matrimonial home their whole lives.
 
As much as we like to see homeowners upgrade as their families grow and their financial abilities increase, it’s a bit too much to take when a first-time couple homeowner gets hung up on potential upside when they should be paying more attention to whether the unit they’re viewing is actually liveable and suits their current needs.
 
This is essentially pretending to be an investor. When homeowners do commit this sin, they tend to eliminate 90% of their options.
 
And this is when attribution bias kicks in. “Oh poor me! I have so few choices because property prices are so expensive, not because I’m picky and have my priorities all wrong!”


#2: We were deluded about property in the past
 
Despite recent changes to CPF rules, most Singaporeans are unable to accept the new reality of owning a resale flat (for instance, accepting zero value after 99 years) even if, barring it’s lease, it’s a perfectly suited property for them.
 
Buyers are so anchored to the profits made by HDBs in decades past, that their disappointment at the government’s reality check was amplified to the nth degree. They might not admit it but almost overnight many homebuyers relegated resale HDB flats to b**tard child status, a non-option and a non-starter for them.
 
That’s a downright shame. I mean, just do the math, even if you’re a really just a tenant under HDB and not an owner, forking out $500k for a 4- or 5-room flat with two-thirds its lease remaining (say, 68 years) translates to a lifetime cost of $834 per month even after factoring in 2.6% interest.
 
Such flats are all over Singapore, and on 99.co there’s also tons of newer flats at this price range. You cannot get this sort of deal in another developed country.
 
Then again, to many Singaporeans the mention of “resale HDB” has become more frightening than seeing a ghost during the 7th month.


#3: We conveniently forgot how high interest rates were
 
We may argue that property prices were lower “back then”, but perhaps we also forget that home loan interest rates once stood between 3 to 4%, nearly double the current rates. Many times, rates spiked to above 4%. These are percentages that would be unthinkable to homebuyers today.
 
This extraordinary period of low interest rates has in part driven property demand and transaction volume in Singapore over the past decade (except during periods of economic downturn, e.g. 2015). Hence, it would’ve been reasonable to expect inflation in property prices during this period. So, you win some (lower interest rates), you lose some (higher property prices).
 
As of July 2018, the 3-month SIBOR stands at 2.00% after successive rounds of tightening by the US Federal Reserve. The days of ultra-low home loan rates may be over, but it is unlikely to deter most homebuyers. In fact, the anticipation of imminent interest rate hikes again triggers our kiasu mentality. “Buy now and lock in low-ish rates while you still can!”


#4: We are flogging the wrong horse. Whine about property size instead!
 
We feel that local property buyers are missing the forest for the trees. Instead of whining about property prices, surely shrinking homes is the bigger issue. Now it’s the norm for kitchens to be reduced to a row of shelving along a hallway, and in some new launch condos bedrooms appear to be designed for deluxe leprechaun living.
 
Here’s the reality: to make new launch condo projects appeal to buyers despite rising property prices, developers have been reducing the size of condominium units across the board since the start of this decade. Where it was once common for 3-bedroom condo units to exceed 1,000 square feet in floor area, buyers of new launches would be lucky to even get 900 square feet.
 
To us, it simply does not make sense that a condo unit is now smaller than a HDB flat with the same number of bedrooms!
 
This is not the worst thing, mind you. The worst thing is seeing so many buyers willingly settle for less (space) like moths flocking to a flame. Not that new launch condos are bad (most have better facilities/design), but Singaporeans have a superficial tendency to pursue shiny new things when purchasing a more spacious – and not to mention cheaper – resale condo would be a better choice for them.
 
As property buyers, we Singaporeans should be reflecting on our decision making instead of complaining about property prices so much.


#5: Globalization has changed the property game and is here to stay
 
As much as Trump wants to tariff Chinese goods, and as much as our government want to slap Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD) on foreigners and foreign developers, globalization has affected our property market in terms of pricing and sizing of newer units.
 
The recent years have seen some crazy bids for Government Land Sales (GLS) exercises and collective sales of older condos, driven by the influx of bullish developers from China. To stay competitive, make money and not go bust, homegrown developers like CDL and Oxley are driven to downsize units. 
 
By downsizing units, developers can fit more units in a single development. Each smaller unit sells at an increased per-square-foot price while keeping overall price quantum palatable to buyers. Luckily URA has caught on to the act, announcing several rules last year stipulating the average minimum unit sizes in a condo development.
 
Chinese money from developers and buyers have already driven up the prices of Hong Kong private housing to astronomical levels, and after wreaking havoc on affordability there, it is simply natural progression for them to have set their sights on Singapore. 
 
And we’ll say it here: Only by pissing off Chinese developers and buyers in some way (e.g. higher ABSD) can we prevent housing affordability and liveability standards in Singapore from going down the sewage.
 
So, if you’re whining about increased cost to purchase a property because of ABSD, we should be thankful that our government decided to raise it in 2018 for both locals and foreigners. The alternative reality could’ve been much worse.
 
All said and done, we’ll leave you with some statistical evidence that, yes, our homes are still considered affordable, at least for the time being:
 
From 2008 to 2018, our median income increased by 53% from $2,897 in 2008 to $4,437 in 2018.
 
Meanwhile, here’s the increase in per-square-foot property prices in Singapore over the same period.
 
Reasonable, don’t you think?

Foreigners snapped up 18% of total apartment purchases in Q2
 

There was a surge of demand from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.
 
The purchases of uncompleted apartments by foreigners accounted for 18% of the total number of transactions in Q2, up 10% YoY or 40% QoQ to 410 units, according to data from Jefferies Equity Research.
 
The report noted that this was the highest share of non-locals in purchases for uncompleted apartments since Q2 2018.
 
In H1, the share of non-Singaporean private property purchases rose to 22% YoY. Jefferies also mentioned that there is a surge of demand from overseas buyers during the quarter, particularly from Hong Kong and China. Buyers from the two markets, along with Taiwan, makes up 11% of the total recorded transactions.
 
Typical demand profile of transactions ranges between $1.5-3m. Interest was concentrated across central area projects such as Boulevard 88 and One Pearl Bank. Agents also commented that the projects of developers with presence in Hong Kong such as Artra, Margaret Ville, Parc Esta, Stirling Residences were preferred by Chinese buyers.
 
For mid-August, foreign purchases accounted for 5% of the total uncompleted apartment transactions, as compared to 22% for H1, thanks to higher number of purchases from locals. Jeffries noted that these prospects are back to buying city or city-fringe units in Singapore.

The temperature and humidity may reach a level that is unbearable to many ppl. If you are still alive by then, better move to elsewhere lah.

I believe with technology advancement, water issue can be solved. I hope our leader is not giving us half the picture only and neglected the other half on rising temperature. I predict in 100 yrs time, Spore average temp may reach 40s deg. We should also start looking at how countries like Dubai cope with high temp. Every bus-stops, sheltered walk way, mrt stations that are above ground will need aircon. Outdoor parks will be meaningless. Anyway i dare not imagine lah. Thats why my biggest qn is whether this place is still suitable for living.

But every time she asks me back where is that magical place free from all these issues, I really struggle to find a place to escape to permanently. Most can meet some conditions some parts of the year but not all parts.

Have lah, temperate countries at higher latitude should be alright to live in, such as Canada. It is just that equatorial region like Spore will be too hot and humid by then. Anyway, living here in 100 yrs time is certainly not something which i look forward for my future gen. I hope they can have the ability to migrate elsewhere.

The solution is to tackle the root cause, literally.  A better way is to stabilise the roots and stem of the trees, coupled with periodic pruning.  The easy way out is to remove the large trees and plant those that do not provide much shade.
 
We will see the effect of this policy change in tree management a few more years when the microclimate becomes hotter in Singapore due to over-development and use of air-con.

Unless we are talking about creating rain forest or size of water catchment area, otherwise i think planting trees alone wont solve the problem. We have too much of built up area.

As I have mentioned, only certain months it's liveable. Most tropics-born persons will find Canada too cold for most months.
 
https://www.tripsavvy.com/canada-temperatures-by-month-and-city-1481747
 
Regarding humidity, we are already saturated, with most months hitting high humidity close to 100%.
 
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/singapore-hot-weather-urban-heat-effect-temperature-humidity-11115384
 
Temperature is a real issue that will be compounded with humidity to create a real problem. Current coping measures include aircon and future technology such as wearable cooling devices. Hide in malls, gyms or swimming pools?
 
The optimal answer still evades for me though.
 
For a good friend of mine, his solution is to spend a few months in country A, a few months in B and a few months in C. That will solve the comfortable climate problem for one, but mean essentially a lifetime drifting between countries. That will likely also involve huge amounts of funds!

The solution is to tackle the root cause, literally.  A better way is to stabilise the roots and stem of the trees, coupled with periodic pruning.  The easy way out is to remove the large trees and plant those that do not provide much shade.
 
We will see the effect of this policy change in tree management a few more years when the microclimate becomes hotter in Singapore due to over-development and use of air-con.
You talk as if stabilizing tree no need money. In the end everything cost $$. I sure won’t want tons of money be used to stabilize trees. I rather just cut down the number. 
I think there is a limit to innovation on greenery. The dumb ass idea of putting plants on bus roof is one.
 
And this here is one big ass failure.

+1 trees are nice and do help, but expecting the government to monitor all of them is a big ask.

Secondary sale transactions plunged 62.35% to 1,840 units
 

secondary sale transactions in Q2 plunged 62.35% YoY to 1,840 units as buyer sentiments weakened.
 
However in a quarterly basis, it recovered 13.4% following the decline in Q1 to 1,623 units. The same trend was observed with primary sales transactions as it went down 28.1% YoY.
 
secondary sales would likely be in the range of 7,000 to 8,000 units in 2019, noting that sales may be projected to increase as real estate is perceived as a safer investment for long term capital appreciation.
 
“Buyers with a longer investment horizon are likely to overlook the stamp duties due to Singapore’s stable political environment and its potential upside as a gateway city to fast-growing Southeast Asia,” 
 
In addition, the report stated that new sales rose 28.4% QoQ to 2,159 units in Q2 from 1,681 units in Q1. These sales are projected to reach between 7,000 to 8,000 units by year-end.

At some juncture after the enbloccers are done, most of the remaining owners have no intention to sell for their own reasons. Especially so if they are holding on to a decent or good location. 
This is the most likely explanation for the dwindling volume.

I believe with technology advancement, water issue can be solved. I hope our leader is not giving us half the picture only and neglected the other half on rising temperature. I predict in 100 yrs time, Spore average temp may reach 40s deg. We should also start looking at how countries like Dubai cope with high temp. Every bus-stops, sheltered walk way, mrt stations that are above ground will need aircon. Outdoor parks will be meaningless.
Anyway i dare not imagine lah. Thats why my biggest qn is whether this place is still suitable for living.

 
If the temperatures do reach into 40s, the population would have dwindled and Singapore's viability would be in doubt.
 
Not an issue for us and our kids but beyond them, i guess my bloodline, if there remains one, would have migrated to somewhere slightly cooler.
 
I am not even sure if in 100 years time, Singapore will still be around. Most probably a province of China.

Pray think again. 
Search online for the most guarded city in the world, or the most protected city.
 
When the survival of a tiny red dot hinges upon action or inaction, the only question that remains is how much we need to pay to survive.

All these talk ministerial talk of doing the part against global warming, should start from home
 
Pristine forest land like tengah, bukit timah, east coast and what nots have all been rapid cut down after providing insufficient HDBs prior 2011...
 
If they were serious about it, it would be good to plant a similar sized tree for every one cut to enable shade...
 
There is always a large temperature delta between exposed and shaded areas... so it still makes SG habitable... 
 
If we are only left with token plants, SG would be just a barren piece of granite with unconducive living space only for its people to survive, but not thrive

All Singapore had since independence had never been true pristine forests but were all Secondary rainforests. 
It’s a tough balance and I agree that there has been too much deforestation of late.
 
But I suppose this is a choice between a rock and a very hard place. The electorate certainly would not buy in to underprovision of dwelling units no matter how valid the reason.

With ABSD, less willing to sell unless required ... once sold to buy again pay 12% more.

			SINGAPORE (BLOOMBERG) - Singapore's housing market isn't turning out to be the beneficiary many may have thought from Hong Kong's increasingly fraught protests. Instead, investors are looking to cheaper property markets like Malaysia, Thailand and Taiwan.
		

			"People here tend to think there are only two cities in the world - Hong Kong and Singapore," said Alan Cheong, a Singapore-based executive director of research and consultancy at Savills Plc. "They think if people flee Hong Kong, they'll all automatically come to Singapore. But everyone isn't Li Ka-shing. Most are just ordinary salaried workers," he said, referring to Hong Kong's richest billionaire.
		

			As anti-government demonstrations approach their fourth month, many people with the means in Hong Kong have been looking at contingency plans. They can range from shifting funds abroad to physically moving from the city. Hong Kong has held the title of the world's least affordable real estate for nine years in a row now, and unhappiness over property prices is one factor fueling the unrest.
		

			In Malaysia, for instance, "a property in central Kuala Lumpur could cost RM1,500 (S$496) per square foot," Cheong said. "An apartment in a similar area of Singapore would be $1,500 or more." Thailand, meanwhile, is popular for its touristy allure, he said.
		

			Singapore is particularly expensive when extra costs, like additional buyer's stamp duty, are factored in. Foreigners buying residential property in the city-state since July 2018 pay stamp duty of 20 per cent, up from 15 per cent before the government cooling measures were introduced.
		





Hong Kong citizens purchased just 12 apartments in Singapore in the first half of 2019, down from 32 in the first six months of 2018. From July through mid-August, when street protests turned violent, that dwindled to just four, data from ERA Research & Consultancy show.

	Very easy to be blindsided by the reports.


	Retirees of course cannot consider Singapore.


	Those whom we want to attract and who can benefit Singapore, they may most likely come as foreigners, apply for PR and rent first.


	Watch the rent data first.


	The sales data will not move so fast since the protests only started in June. The effects have a time lag.

	I agree. Those can afford will know where they wish to go. West is too far and culturally not ideal for some. Of course if you are under budget, then even thailand or Vietnam also have to consider. For those getting out of HK because they think they are not part of china, then taiwan is definitely not their consideration too.

	It's hard to justify a LH landed in this area, with minimal amenities nearby - you need to drive out for almost everything..

			SINGAPORE - Developer Bukit Sembawang Estates has sold 71 of the 78 homes of its Luxus Hills (Signature Collection) during the preview weekend.
		

			32 homes were sold on Aug 30, the first day of preview, prompting the developer to release the remaining 46 homes for sale. Prices ranged from $3.058 million to $4.2 million.
		

			95 per cent of buyers bought homes for their own occupation, while about three quarters of buyers were 30 to 60 years old, indicating interest from multi-generational families, Bukit Sembawang said. 75 per cent of buyers also opted for flexible deferred payment schemes.
		

			Located in Seletar Hills Estate, the 999-year leasehold landed development comprises 58 intermediate terraces, 10 corner terraces and 10 semi-detached homes. The intermediate terraces are between 3,757 and 3,810 square feet (sq ft) in size; the corner terraces are from 3,541 to 3,671 sq ft, and the semi-detached units, from 3,541 to 3,671 sq ft. The base per-square-foot (psf) price is around $1,894.
		

			Ho Jenny, general manager (marketing) at Bukit Sembawang Estates, said: "We are heartened by the positive response for the Luxus Hills (Signature Collection). Buyers were largely attracted to Luxus Hills because of the large living spaces offered by these rare landed 999-year homes in a family-friendly environment. Our flexible payment schemes with the option for immediate occupancy also proved popular with buyers who could then comfortably plan their move-in and financing timelines."
		

			Among the several payment plans for the project is the Stay & Pay Scheme, under which buyers can move in upon making a 20 per cent down payment. The Reservation Scheme accepts reservations with a 10 per cent deposit, with the rest of the payments to be made in 2021.These schemes are designed for buyers who are waiting for the proceeds from the sale of their property, and owners of properties undergoing en bloc sales, said the developer.

	Avenue South Residences' plot is within a very quiet neighborhood with a few places of worship.  The problem is AYE and CTE converge at that point and this limits its accessibility and potential.  The key selling point is near the hospitals.

	There's a need to balance the potential growth, which is a real thing, versus the possible and also the fact that we have so many units coming up. If one buys too much into the hype, you may pay too much. Stand by the side too long and you may lose out too.


	So is there a middle ground? Yes, but it will depend on your own skill and sleuthing abilities to find a good value place. Typically it's not the new ones that offer value, rather, the almost new between 5-15 years old that offer more value. 


	In the area, there are many such units, you just need to look harder...

	Actually the proximity part makes sense..


	Those who are renting don't drive hence they want a place near work - if they work there.


	Nurses will squeeze a few into the same unit. 


	Sirens usually get switched off in the hospital itself.


	But the trains aren't near and it's not really that great an area nor is there a great view unless you have the right facing. So do your homework I say... YMMV...

	I stay 1-2 bus stops away from SK hospital.  Ever since last August, more ambulance sirens are heard.  Sometimes (few times a week) will hear siren middle of the nite.  It didn't help when the fire station is nearby too.  Some people may not like it. 😄


	So if stay there have to get used to it.  I'm used to it already.😄

	Practically speaking, it might not be a bad idea to be near a hospital. The optimal state is to be a couple of streets away and not directly beside or facing it.

	Japan has lots of earthquakes. Different story.


	The density is also more manageable with more options to build outside city centre.


	We really have very little choice in this regard.

	Singhealth is expanding the SGH campus and more docs will be working there soon in their grand master plan.


	Anyway you might be surprised to know that many people can afford car but chose to live within walking distance or 1 mrt stop to where they work, including docs, bankers and so on. I have a doc friend who will never buy a car and his plan is to shift as conveniently as possible to where his clinic is located. Another friend who is in real estate business is making good money but chose to stay at Bain Street where his office is close by and not get a car too.


	So don't rule out the desirability of people wanting to stay close to where they work even if they can afford car but chose not to. Even those that have car often also like to stay near to where they work (not necessarily walking distance but within a few mrt stops).

			Practically speaking, it might not be a bad idea to be near a hospital. The optimal state is to be a couple of streets away and not directly beside or facing it.

			from fengshui perspective, no good to be near epicenter of negative energy
		



	I believe this is applicable if the "near" is really "near", like next to it or directly opposite. Avenue South I believe is couple of streets away and effects of "neg energy" coming from hospital is negligible I think.

			Singhealth is expanding the SGH campus and more docs will be working there soon in their grand master plan.
		

			Anyway you might be surprised to know that many people can afford car but chose to live within walking distance or 1 mrt stop to where they work, including docs, bankers and so on. I have a doc friend who will never buy a car and his plan is to shift as conveniently as possible to where his clinic is located. Another friend who is in real estate business is making good money but chose to stay at Bain Street where his office is close by and not get a car too.

	Agree. I live near SGH and I have friend asking me if I wanna rent out my room to his cousin, a doctor. Reason: rather rent to be near work place.

	Tiny island like Singapore,  where also not much difference except for those designated as industrial areas. East side near changi airport good meh? Every minute got plane fly up or down. Just imagine the air pollution. 


	Maybe Sentosa air is the best lah.

	Talk about air, I think those near reservoir, forested area best.... Canberra, sembawang, upper thomson, bedok res, upper bukit Timah.... I like but others might not like. As long as not major pollution or really distinct, its not gonna be the main factor. If haze hit, even Orchard road is not spared cos no place is  excluded. So I guess other factors like amenities still rank higher in priority.

	It is the PRC market especially for the high ends. Would this trend stop? Personally I think unlikely. What would it take to stop them? Control from China on fund transfer and country selling property imposing restrictions.
