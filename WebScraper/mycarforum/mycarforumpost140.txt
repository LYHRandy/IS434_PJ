Ok guys..
 
I’m new to this, virgin..
I just got my house keys last Friday.. it’s a premium flat at punggol MRT area..
Was nice until the contractor came in and gave me the pricing..
 
$15k for simple works..
 
Basically, I want to tear down a HDB wall and re-erect a new one at further away.
(this, already cost me $1.5k-2k). the re-erect portion can be bricks or just partition..  as we got no plans for it.
 
Then I intend to raise the flooring of kitchen for cabinet, washing machine, 2 x toilets..
 
Carpentry is really a major cost contributor..
My kitchen is 3.48m long and only have space for floor type..
 
I didn’t intend to engage any ID, I wish to be my own main con..
I also exploring the possibility of getting carpentry works in Malaysia.
 
Hence is there any tips for me..

Nowadays, reno very expensive. Completed my mum's place reno two months back, cost me $30+k. Last time(8years ago) my own place reno, $12+k only.
 
Source ard for contractors. Me got four to quote b4 settling for the most reasonable one. Not the cheapest nor the most expensive one. The most expensive one started to slash his prices when I told him I not going to engage him. Slash until became the cheapest + throw in freebies. This one I very scared!!! If let him do sure habis lah. Later during reno time, he bring cheapo stuff or cut corners, jialat liao. So be very careful.

furniture from malaysia may not have much saving actually and not guarantee also. I think $12K for kitchen can be slightly high (say $3K for hacking the wall and erect another one).
 
i did some checking and quote for re-modeling my kitchen probably cost around $15K-$18K, but that would include hacking of existing wall/floor tile and storeroom wall, new tiles and carpentry, raise floor and glass panel, plus some extra piping, feature wall, etc.

Usually if you want to tear down wall, reno fees will be quite expensive, no choice if you want to do this. Reno pricing really depends what you want to do and also how big your flat is la. I know the reno fee for 2 room flat for whole house cost less than 10K.

 if you are not familiar the renovation procedure jus let a contractor to do everything, and buy your preference light and water fittings, kitchen appliances pass to the contractor. For curtain and aircon you may enage separately, and aircon got to install before any ceiling work.

Usually if you want to tear down wall, reno fees will be quite expensive, no choice if you want to do this. Reno pricing really depends what you want to do and also how big your flat is la. I know the reno fee for 2 room flat for whole house cost less than 10K. 
 
*ahem* My old resale 2-room flat not even full reno I already paid more than 10k....

$15k for simple works.. 
Basically, I want to tear down a HDB wall and re-erect a new one at further away.
(this, already cost me $1.5k-2k). the re-erect portion can be bricks or just partition..  as we got no plans for it.
 
Then I intend to raise the flooring of kitchen for cabinet, washing machine, 2 x toilets..
 
Carpentry is really a major cost contributor..
My kitchen is 3.48m long and only have space for floor type..
 
I didn’t intend to engage any ID, I wish to be my own main con..
I also exploring the possibility of getting carpentry works in Malaysia.
 
Hence is there any tips for me.. 

 
As another bro has mentioned, $15K seems reasonable for the extend of work you want (especially the hacking of a wall).
 
As another bro has mentioned, since its you are a virgin (in renovation, not in bed!  ), engage a trusty contractor and let him do everything for you, and you just monitor him. Any issue, just go to him!
 
You may want to consider not hacking out the wall (is it really necessary?)
You may want to consider not flooring the 2x toilets (is it really necessary?)
 
Kitchen cabinet, room wardrobe and raise floor for washer/kitchen cabinet is unavoidable cost.
 
You may get your own carpenters from Malaysia, but if anything goes "wrong" how?

Even got main con also need to go and check. These fellas can get away with what they will get away with what. By the time all done, too late to change, so really really really really really must go down and check. Leave NOTHING to chance. This is your house, so it is worth the effort. Don't cut corners, the contractors will more than do that for you.
 
IMO.. if you want to be the main con, you must have go down everyday to monitor the progress of your reno.

I'm not lah. But i'm renovating my BTO currently also.
 
Wetworks is more to tell contractor what u want to do
- so hacking, retiling, waterproof, putting shower kerbs + cement base are all "wetworks"
 
HDB regulation i believe only ask regarding wall hacking and any changes to beam structures plus any significant changes to floor especially kitchen or toilet etc. So your wall changes that one need to submit permit to HDB. other stuff they don't really care.
But all this done for me by my ID.

Ok guys..
 
I’m new to this, virgin..
I just got my house keys last Friday.. it’s a premium flat at punggol MRT area..
Was nice until the contractor came in and gave me the pricing..
 
$15k for simple works..
 
Basically, I want to tear down a HDB wall and re-erect a new one at further away.
(this, already cost me $1.5k-2k). the re-erect portion can be bricks or just partition..  as we got no plans for it.

I also exploring the possibility of getting carpentry works in Malaysia.
 
Hence is there any tips for me.. 

 
Really suggest you go with Contractor unless you know how to do everything overall yourself. The most expensive purchase is the cheapest that doesn't work. In trying to save some money you may end up spending alot more.
Contractors usually have economies of scale which you do not have. Just the tearing down and erection of a new wall and raising of flooring are already major works.
 
Especially if things are done in the toilets and kitchen, the water proofing needs to be looked into. Not done properly you have tiles popping and stuff. Also, HDB floors have "warranty" for the kitchen and toilet areas if you leave it as is. If you modify you open yourself up to more issues.
 
Get an experienced contractor who will look after your interest and earn a reasonable amount. Don't be penny wise and pound foolish.
 
Coming in here to ask for tips probably shows you not very sure....

you can check with the contractor, raising floor base on the existing tile (no hacking of floor tile) and the shower kerbs should be quite ok, not much wet work there.

as with anything, you need black and white to avoid any disputes. 
 
for ID and reno, the drawings is very very important. You cannot be there during the full duration, so worst case would be after the thing is done/erected and it is not what you wanted, then it becomes your words against his. Even if you 'win' the arguement, the contractor buay song.. something somewhere else will be compromised for sure. 
 
Having a good ID guy might be good due to his experience and he might have better ways to achieve certain things and foresee problems before it happens. And most importantly, if there are drawings and anything is to go wrong, you have someone to blame. I rather let the ID guy be the project manager but do communicate properly what exactly you want for your house. There is zero tolerance for any error as it will be such a nightmare (heard so many horror stories).
 
But of cos... you must be well versed in drawings reading to protect yourself.

yeah, the price is exorbitant..
 
actually the cost is low, just that through exchange of hands, it become expensive..
 
nope, did not roll pineapple.. got scolding from my  guru..
 
basically, he tell me not to be too superstitious
 
so what i did was simple:
 
3 loud knocks on door.
slowly open as those 'things' may dash out
usually open in daylight.
then air the house with main door open, i didn't step in yet..
5mins of smoking break..
first thing is to open all windows.
then i just sprinkle some holy water..
 
important dates for me is the day of starting 'work'
then day to move in or house my altar.

Since the quote from contractors. Usually if you tell them that you want to hack down any wall or take out any existing floor titles etc, they will charge you more, maybe for the labour fee?! So add on to the whole reno fees and overall amount paid might be higher?!

Bro, suggest those structural works, get a local contractor to do for you.  Well, you can get a contactor  from Msia, but make sure he knows HDB rules well. But it's still a risk because anything goes wrong, it's gonna be a hassle to find him back.
 
Save money however, on the fittings and furnitures. These you can buy from Msia/taobao if you want.
 
If your earlier 15k is for the structural work from a local contractor, I think that reasonable la for a peace of mind.

Honestly, most carpenters and tilers of any worth is likely working in singapore daily and commuting back every evening.
All the experienced carpenters and tilers are from JB one lor. Of course there are PRC and some experienced banglas also but 80-90% are malaysian.
 
So why not look for them in SG?? Go JB look for what lol.
But your wetworks are simple lah. Just get a good carpenter can liao. Go renotalk and look for carpenter lor.
Pretty simple reasoning for JB craftsman right. Earn SGD rather than earn RM that is 2.57x less...

I can tell you that contractors will just find items to put up parts of their profit and will especially put into those items they think you won't take out from their quote. I have seen quotes for hacking of 1 wall, the same wall, and it is not a very big wall, vary by more than 2k, what do you think?

my experience trying to go cheap.
 
1st house back in 2006, went for a ID, but everything very specific and simple carpentry in kitchen with BLUM
3 toilets redo, new bowls and sink, tiles, shower accessories
no hacking.
Carpentry to create fake wall hiding a room door. This fake wall later covered in wall paper, paid seperately at Good rich. carpentry on master wardrobe.
also false ceiling
All furniture sourced by me.
Bed - shopped at ID store and notice his supplier/manufactuer number and company, so I called direct and good a discount with delivery. He was based in sungei kadut. U may want to drive around there to check out, many small / med / big furniture manufacturer.
 
Sofa/table/lights I buy retail, and 1st hand. overall, very happy with the quality and the finishes.
 
reno cost 12345, furniture / accesories add another few k, less than 5k
 
2nd home 2008, not much reno to begin with as house was new, abeit old. redo wardrobe, extend and enlarge. fix fase ceiling border only, not the whole ceiling.
all furniture new. Bought display set at OM
bed, same manufacturer as last one. Think its called www.cityfurniture.com.sg
note they manufacture some of the beds you see at Taka mattress showroom, so you can go down to see and tell them what you want. I custom a design with storage under my bed. only $700+king size
2 toilets carpentry, basic under vanity change.
This is when I regret choosing a contractor, not a ID to do this round.
This lousy contractor is only good for carpentry, he tried to co ordinate the rest, painting / toilets / water proofing. All other jobs besides carpentry was lousy.
 
Painting sux and I had to complain he redo them over 4 to 5 x, patchy and he did not smoothen out kinks before painting.
Water works was terrible, 2nd main toilet, water proofing is find but gradient of shower flr if flat so water does not drain out properly. I redo this with another contractor, still sae case.
I can only blame myself. Should have used an ID.
few yrs later since moved in, so never fixed these stuff.. i kinda regret cos face these issues everyday, and dun wan to go thru the mah fun of redo reno. Sux.

"before doing the first hacking, mix some rice and salt inside plastic bag, go into the house and throw them into every 4 corners of the rooms, toilets, storeroom and kitchen. leave the house by closing the main door and go for breakfast. come back later about half an hour, use 'Sey Liew' leaves with water and sprinkle at all rooms to clance the house".... 

 
thanks thanks, too bad.. i didn't do the above.. strictly follow what my guru says...

When we buy we hire contractor only - not much to do, just some tiles, install lights, install sink and that's all. 
 
We do aircon from separate contractor
 
Buy all furniture from as is corner at Ikea, so all very cheap. 
 
No hacking at all 
 
BIGGEST THING - if doing hacking it MUST be done by a licensed contractor.

Any unoccupied buildings for a period of times will invite 'un-invited' guess. They will occupy empty space. The things I mentioned is to feed them with rice & salt first and later inform them that you are going to stay this house and thereby after feeding them, sprinkle the water with 'sey lew' leaves aka 'ang huay heok' starting from rooms and then to the main gate. Thereafter, ask your contractor to start work.
 
For throwing of pineapple, the word in hokkien is 'onglai or wanglai', luck come but if you don't chase 'them' away, how to expect 'wanglai'...

still need. This is for starting of renovation work and no need to sweep away. 
 
Hacking off a piece of the wall during cetrain timing is for to start reno or 'heng kang' hopping that reno carry on smoothly.
 
Like DBSS house where most of the things had been done, still sprinkle mix rice & salt and later 'sey lew' leave water to clance the house. The only different is later you have to sweep the floor off the rice & salt before shifting in your barang garang.

Remember, choose a piece of the wall that you intend to renovate. Like some don't like the pillars at the entrance to be square and would like to renovate it by 'rounded' it. Then you hack a piece of the angle out for 'yi sze yi sze'....
 
Hack wrong wall or place and later patch back won't work ...

Sometimes just need to pay for an ID as the PM for the reno lar, hard to save on that unless u got the time to spare and experience to know what to watch for. Just try to minimise carpentry that are permanent (eg. wardrobes, tv consoles) and go for off the shelf stuff.
 
Usually are cheaper and can replace in a few years when u get bored of them or wanna redo the layout.
 
For the rest of the small electricals, see what your petrol pts, credit card points etc can redeem. Can at least use for a year or 2 before needing to purchase better replacements.

some ID advocate simplicity even long time ago, plain 4 corners are the best, hate false ceiling that is home to all insects. 
 
Rather work on good concept or theme which can be changeable every 2-3 years, re-arrange furniture (or new furniture) and a new coat of paint

This project needs preparation and dedication.
 
Discuss with your gf/ wifey, set some broad expectations, source and decide, determine the sequence of work.
 
Off hand, i would think
layout, aircon, electricity/ lighting, flooring/wet works, cabinet, painting, furniture.
 
Renovation can be one big money pit, set a budget and stick to it.
 
You can also check www.renotalk.com forum for some ideas or discussed with some like minded posters.

As a side note - any particular reason why only a system 1 aircon? 
 
Give some thought to a system 3 or 4 inverter style 
 
Why? 
a) Big inverter compressor is no more expensive to run than smaller system 1
b) system 1 can only be used in 1 room (duh!) so if have unexpected guests, want to host a CNY meal or mahjong session or want to use second room as office later are outta luck - whereby if prepare first then can still do this
c) there is not a massive price difference between system 1 and a system 3 / 4 -(I.e system 1 might be $1200, can get system 3 for $2200 etc) so you get economies of scale by doing first

False ceiling or connice is to hide the unsightly trunkings for cables that you are running all over the ceiling if you are planning to do downlight.
 
Unless you want to do undertable method by asking the contractor to hack a "drain" along the walls/ceilings to conceal the cables. In this way, it's still cheaper and faster to do a false ceiling.

well, i work as a purchaser mah..
so everything to be is cost saving and cost justifiable..
 
i cannot accept the exorbitant cost... i been losing sleep since i got the keys..
 
i know HDB regulations, hacking and wet work, is only done via registered companies in singapore.
 
may i know what do they mean by wet work?
 
I intend to do this, hacking by Singapore company.
then raising for floor tiles, carpentry, furniture all by malaysia.
 
doable?

Good luck to you if you think such pricing is exorbitant.... Short of DIY, I can't think of alternative.... But then again, you don't have HDB lesen to do hacking, and so again, also screwed....

Ok guys..
 
I’m new to this, virgin..
I just got my house keys last Friday.. it’s a premium flat at punggol MRT area..
Was nice until the contractor came in and gave me the pricing..
 
$15k for simple works..
 
Basically, I want to tear down a HDB wall and re-erect a new one at further away.
(this, already cost me $1.5k-2k). the re-erect portion can be bricks or just partition..  as we got no plans for it.
 
Then I intend to raise the flooring of kitchen for cabinet, washing machine, 2 x toilets..
 
Carpentry is really a major cost contributor..
My kitchen is 3.48m long and only have space for floor type..
 
I didn’t intend to engage any ID, I wish to be my own main con..
I also exploring the possibility of getting carpentry works in Malaysia.
 
Hence is there any tips for me..

Not to scare you leh....really.

 
The design of the gates already prevent liftings. The 2 "welders" approached my unit previously and I challenged them to lift my gate when it is fully closed. Told them if they managed to lift it open as claimed, I'll get them to weld all 9 bolts. They refused to and left.
 
So long as the latches at the top and bottom are secured, the gate is secured till you cut the lock.
 
If you examine the hinges on the main movable gate, there is a semi-circle sphere shaped object. This will be latched onto the main gate when you close it, making it impossible to remove the entire gate structure even when the hinges are removed.
 
Don't be taken in. When I asked them for more details, they are very elusive. Tell them no $ can pay be cheque, they don't want.
 
Go read around the forums, it's just throwing away good money to have the hinges re-welded and void HDB's warranty.

The bare minimum you will need to do is to renovate your kitchen. Rest can buy from furniture stores. Be mindful that renovation cost is only tip of the iceberg. You need to pay for furniture, electronics, applicances, curtain, lighting and eletric wiring which set you by another 10-15k.
 
So go for a simple reno will do.

well, i work as a purchaser mah..
so everything to be is cost saving and cost justifiable..
 
i cannot accept the exorbitant cost... i been losing sleep since i got the keys..
 
i know HDB regulations, hacking and wet work, is only done via registered companies in singapore.
 
may i know what do they mean by wet work?
 
I intend to do this, hacking by Singapore company.
then raising for floor tiles, carpentry, furniture all by malaysia.
 
doable?

actually, the contractors are also having a though time in singapore..
 
having to pay high rental and pay yet hard to get workers. and now challenges from the north..

 
yeah, but the quality is better than singapore.
 
let me share this:
 
for a queen size bed frame (VIP type with crystal) and latex mattress etc.
6' warerobe
half leather cow hide sofa, 3 seater type.
stool for legs
GST, levy.
 
RM8k net.
 
 

If you are looking at those ready made furniture the one in SG may even come from MY in the first place.
 
However, if you are looking at kitchen cabinets, wardrobe and such, I don't think SG standard lose very much to MY lo.

constraints:
physical, scheduling, budget, feature, bureaucratic...
 
access your priorities, aware of your constraints and (refer to past used cases , e.g. in renotalk or other forums) make an informed decision.
 
there r some dependencies or preferred sequences:
e.g. Painting and final washing should be the last step, how you run your air con water pipes or electrical wiring , covered or exposed, future expansion possible? network cables, fibre / router termination points...
 
It is a journey, there will be setbacks, compromises, obstacles, ...
Enjoy it and be satisfied with what u have done, to your abilities and available resources.

One way to save is to buy furniture and curtain from Malaysia though I must say, the gap is narrowing as the demand has grown. Also, there's always bigger risk in getting from outside Singapore. Over eight years ago, I bought almost all my furnitures from my hometown. It was by accident actually. We were having breakfast at the place we usually go and next to it, was a furniture shop and the staff happen to be the wife of my church friend. We bought
3 + 2 + 1 fabric sofa and a glass top coffee table
2 bedroom sets of a queen size bedfame (no mattress), makeup table with chair, 4 feet by 7 feet tall wardrobe and side tables.
1 super single nyatoh bedframe (no mattress) with pull out extra mattress at the bottom
1 set glass top dining table with 6 chairs
1 7-feet long glass top TV cabinet
1 4-feet tall glass top shoe rack with drawer to put keys, wallet, etc.
1 side low cabinet to be put beside the dining table.
 
Total cost? RM 16K
 
Sold it all away (except for the super single bedframe) for SGD 1K when I moved to my new place last year...

yes, i agree to that due to our high levy..
 
yesterday night, we randomly go and window shop furnitures/wardrobe and realize that nowadays, the model kit and chart, are exactly what we saw in johor..
 
basically, they are getting from johor, half the price..
 
based on my requirement, i was quoted around 8k+ but inside this, lots of hidden cost.
permits, tiles.. come on, i know this..
under HDB, there's only 2-3 main distributors.. plus the tiles are the lowest grade and homogenous.. this is something that i felt, local contractors are trying to rip off consumers.
 
for the base and toilet kerb, they need not to get the same tiles, after all. No hacking or tear down.
basically, they just build over the existing..
only the edge are tiles while the top is cement..

I am wondering, if you were to place your new toilet tiles over existing one from HDB, does it void the warranty?

nope, it does not.
under HDB ruling, for the first 5 years, no removal of existing tiles.
 
furthermore, i'm not removing them.
some homes, lay another layer of tiles over them, something like hotel toilet.
as for me, everything remain since we paid for, use it for 5 years then change.
 
as of now, its only building of shower kerbs which is not mentioned in any HDB ruling.

Where did you get the infor most home gates were removed?
 
You can't remove if the gate is closed. HDB has also clarified this.

No, I do not have the info to substantiate my point because news reports do not provide details on the mode of operation used in such crimes. I relied on my own observations (my block alone has 2 homes broken into during that period) and that of my friends' staying in the estate. So, no official statement to back up my post.

Most of the cases are through removing the padlock or breaking the main lock - rather than removing the gate.

Ok guys..
 
Im new to this, virgin..
I just got my house keys last Friday.. its a premium flat at punggol MRT area..
Was nice until the contractor came in and gave me the pricing..
 
$15k for simple works..
 
Basically, I want to tear down a HDB wall and re-erect a new one at further away.
(this, already cost me $1.5k-2k). the re-erect portion can be bricks or just partition..  as we got no plans for it.
 
Then I intend to raise the flooring of kitchen for cabinet, washing machine, 2 x toilets..
 
Carpentry is really a major cost contributor..
My kitchen is 3.48m long and only have space for floor type..
 
I didnt intend to engage any ID, I wish to be my own main con..
I also exploring the possibility of getting carpentry works in Malaysia.
 
Hence is there any tips for me.. 

One very important tip.  Kitchen.
 
As your family grows,  your fridge will also grow.  You will see fridges range from 600mm to 900mm base.
So if possible don't design so that your fridge fits in a hole swee swee one. Cos you will not be able to get a bigger fridge next time. Place it so that there is room to expand.  
 
Get as many power sockets around at your kitchen top as possible. Imagine you have all sorts or appliance on it in future when baby comes.

yeah, as mine is a premium.. so most of the things are plug and play type.
 
my existing base for fridge is already at 940mm, so allow the maximum fridge in the market..

Concur, if possible, just buy the bigger fridge to begin with. You may think you don't need much space since only couple living together. But, even then you will soon realise it's not big enough even  before your babies arrive. Lol....
 
Also, buy one with enough depth so that you can put those birthday cakes in oversized boxes.

anyway i did all the necessary checks with them before i proceed.
 
high chances that their definition of wet works will be spelled out in greater details, as of now, it's still grey.
a big possibilities that for future wet works starting from 2014, may required permit.
 
as of now, it just gossip and speculation.

You can't remove if the gate is closed. HDB has also clarified this.

It is possible. The gates are linked to the door frame using 3 bolts on each side. The thief just need a big hammer and some strength to wack the bolt and it will drop out. Once all the bolts are out, the gate can be carried to one side easily.

The gate hinges still appear outside the frame, becos the gate is open outwards. It is this hinge that the thief can hack out, then remove the whole gate out!

No need to built base for fridge lah. A fridge has its own tall legs to stand on, no need not have another base for it.
Then when you upgrade to a bigger fridge later, there will be no worries at all.

No, it does not. The trick is not to remove the original tiles, but you can overlay it. I have friends who did it - place new (very nice toilet tiles) over the original. It makes the whole toilet looks classy and atas!
 
But, IMO, it is really not necessary.

Yeah I suspect the restriction on the toilet tiles is because of the waterproofing. They don't want people hacking the toilets and doing their own waterproofing then one year later start leaking, big headache for everyone. If first 5 years got leak then at least they can hold the builder responsible.
 
I wish I had more advice to give but mine is bachelor pad so things were done a bit differently and I didn't engage ID. Try to have an idea of how you want the house to look I guess, then work towards that idea.

I disagree fully on this part. Get permanent carpentry Cos the rooms are so small nowadays. U want to maximise the entire floor to ceiling height. Unless the room is meant for your kids. 
I think u all haven't gone into new BTO rooms recently. They are quite small. every nook & cranny especially for wardrobe must be maximised.

If you visit Francfranc or Ki-mono and look at their furniture, they are cater for smaller space, and asian dun need big furniture. Of course the design must meet owner preference. 
 
Personally i dun like to have cabinet hanging in the ceiling or high wall, it block the flow and light, make the space congested. I agree the build-in wardrobe may be the only furniture i want it to be fixed.

overlaying toilet floor tile is fine cos the original waterproofing is already there. However, overlaying toilet wall tile is not advisable as you never know how good the job done on the original, if the old tile fall off, your whole toilet wall will fall off and money wasted.

If u want something aesthetically nicer, i've seen angled wood vertical beams. So beams of wood coming down at say a 30-45 degree angle to the wall.
Looks much much better than your gypsum board false wall. Cost definitely more but can consider.
Allows more light to come thru to your door area.

 It is possible. The gates are linked to the door frame using 3 bolts on each side. The thief just need a big hammer and some strength to wack the bolt and it will drop out. Once all the bolts are out, the gate can be carried to one side easily.

yeah but nowadays, for partition board, you can choose between gypsum & plaster.
Gypsum is commonly use for Office while plaster, the build is better.
Both are quite resistant to fire.

The gate hinges still appear outside the frame, becos the gate is open outwards. It is this hinge that the thief can hack out, then remove the whole gate out!
 
 

 
seriously. if u need to do this.   u might as well go some private estate and climb some walls the same height as the SOC low wall lor. Thief also lazy right ...
 
I only see lot of Police warning housebreaking signs at private estates. Never seen one in HDB estate.

I am not a thief myself so I can't comment on your point.... 
 
I think theives have many types, and their target also (may be) different. Not all will go for private property, and vice versa. It is good as homeowners to be aware of such tactics, be it we living in HDB or private, in low crime or high crime areas.
 

 
I only see lot of Police warning housebreaking signs at private estates. Never seen one in HDB estate. 

Where got don't have? In HDB estate, the anit-crime posters are all pasted in the RC or Town Council's notice board (which is locked). Usually these notice boards are beside the lifts and the block's main lobby.
 
If the Police put a poster at the near the lift door or distribute it door-to-door, then maybe it means recently there's been a increase of crime in the area, and the Police wants to grab the residents attention to it.

That is what I am thinking too. but how does HDB knows if you overlay or replaced the tiles?
 
Overlaying is OK. HDB won't be bother about it.
 
Replacing is NOT OK because there is some waterproof done below the original tiles. HDB will know you had replaced them when your neighbour below complained water leaking from the toilet above (your toilet).

My HDB metal gate looks like this. How to remove it to break into the house?
 


 
There are 6 hinges (using bolt and nuts) protuding out from your gate. Can you see them? 3 on each side. There's one at the same level and beside your door bell button. These hinges operates as a mechanism to allow the gate to swing open or close.
 
To remove the whole gate just wack the nut out, pull out the bolt inside and the gate is disconnected to the door frame. Thereafter you can remove the entire gate out!
 
And after the gate is removed, it is left only the wooden door with a lock! That wooden door, is even more easily to bang open.

it also makes the light coming into the house dimmer. So got trade offs. Anyway the air trapped in the house can circulate. It's usually walls that retain heat more.

When you overlay, you are not removing the tiles. You are just putting another one on-top of the existing one.
 
So if it leaks, it is the original tiles which is poor workmanship that cause the leak, and so not your fault.
 
As long as you DO NOT remove/replace the original tiles, you be alright.

Wouldnt all the knocking cause the neighbors to see? Might as well get a portable gas cutter or angle grinder to just cut away the lock.

Would the nosie attact neighbours? That would depends on what sort of neighbours you have! Some neighbours (even in my own block) are very bo chap one. Some neighbours maybe be very public-spirited but would mistaken it as a renovation contractor hacking a wall, and so ignore the noise.....
 
Would using a gas cutter or grinder be better? That would depends on what sort of theives he is and what he thinks is the best way to break-in. I have no comments on that....

If it is a professional thief, who has all the necessary tools, there is really nothing you can do to stop him from breaking-in.
 
So don't bother to pay someone to extra weld the hinges, or install extra locks or bolt, or even install an alarm!
 
My suggestion is to buy insurance - home protection type, not the compulsory HDB Fire insurance. This home insurance will insured you against thef, fire, water pipe leaks, etc. Once your house is broken-in, call Police and submit claims to the insurance company!

Of course not lah.
 
You must bang the part where the lock is. The aim is to break the lock. In such a case, the quality of the lock would be the important factor.

i believe the premium depends on the amount of assets value you have declared. If you declared $300,000 (in breakdown estimation of each category) and they will cover you  up to $300K.
 
at least this is how it work in the commercial, but fire and break-in is different type of insurance.

not every family leave big sum of cash at home and they dun expect you to do so. You will estimate the max amount of cash that you normally have (maybe like beginning of the month) and state $5K cash, hence the premium will decide accordingly. If you happen to have $20K during the fire, then too bad lor  
 
insurance calculate the risk and the premium reflect such risk.

Erm system 1 inverter. main benefit will be more quiet compared to non inverter. Cos only single FCU to single compressor. Electricity consumption not much difference.
I got starmex system 1 for my MBR. I think u can do the same. I looked at the compressors in my BTO (visible from my floor). I only see starmex lol

Aircon you just ask the salesperson in the shop to recommend lah....then gather all the info and go home to decide which one to buy.
Aircon buy inverter type is a good choice. For ticks, buy up to 3 ticks is good enough.
 
But why you only buy system 1? Your 2 other bedrooms no need aircon meh?

If your max insured amount is only (eg) $300K, how to claim for $1m?

For Aircon, I think Singapore got more variety and better range to select from....just IMO only.

If you rent out your room with aircon, isn't it more attractive to the tennant?
 
Please lah, now aircon is a basic necessity liao. Just like the mobile phone! Why you don't let your children take advantage of the modern technology? You live in stone age doesn't mean they must live in stone age right?
 
Anyway, you need to be aware if later you want to install aircon to your other 2 rooms, there'll be drilling and knocking again and your place becomes messy again. So why not install all now and save yourself the hassle later....

I know but the sector of tenants that I'm targeting is different class. People who want a basic overhead.  
Deprivation, products eventually will phase out for new products introduction. I believe products cost will goes down.
Like tv, 60' below 2k..
 
Things will only be cheaper due to huge supply. 
 
My 2cent of philosophy, although you do have good points there. 
What to do, tight budget and self sponsorship. Everything got to identify - needs/wants

There are 6 hinges (using bolt and nuts) protuding out from your gate. Can you see them? 3 on each side. There's one at the same level and beside your door bell button. These hinges operates as a mechanism to allow the gate to swing open or close.
 
To remove the whole gate just wack the nut out, pull out the bolt inside and the gate is disconnected to the door frame. Thereafter you can remove the entire gate out!
 
And after the gate is removed, it is left only the wooden door with a lock! That wooden door, is even more easily to bang open.
 
 

 
HDB default gate (since '08 at least) actually comes with protuding rods and corresponding holes on the gate and frames such that when it's in a closed position, they are interlocked together and it's not possible to remove the gate from the frame or from each other.
 
So even with all hinges off, it's still not possible to remove the gate from the frame

You should have bought a queen sized bed.....king size is too big for a HDB MBR and looks bulky.
 
Install a ceiling fan, then no need the standing fan. It saves space and even more airy.

Still using PC? Should use laptop or tablet instead. It saves space and easy to carry around...can watch porn in bed easily, then after "follow the action" easily! 
 
Oh, only white colour T-shirt is outside huh. How about the inside? Any restriction on the colour of the bra? 

All my rooms got ceiling fans.

Plus 5.1sound system, can hear the effects from all angles...

I have 1 x king size bed. 1 dressing table. 1 built in wardrobe. 1 wall mounted tv. I trying to squeeze in a area to put stand fan. That's how squeezed it is... 

 
Looks like the new flats are alot smaller. My bedroom at my parent's house can put 1 queen sized bed, One wardrobe with 4 doors. 2 computer tables and one dressing table and one baby cot.

nope, no need since gonna rent out.
 
anyway even have, they also become white elephant.
 
if one day, i got children, i want them to learn the hard way too..
i grow up with no air con, i already gave them a ceiling fan.. hence they should be grateful enough..
lin bei, grow up with a standing fan that had to share with my sister..
so those bugger, cannot be chooser
 
No lah, i mean if i'm insured 1m.. 

Saying is easy. When you have baby, you sure need to switch on aircon. Fan no use de 'cos it's too humid in Singapore. Your baby will be having sleep problem and this will disturb you too. Trust me, gone through this. Lucky we installed aircons in all rooms!
 
Don't forget about global warming. Temperature keeps going up. Unless we see a reversal of temperature, i.e. cold in equator and hot at arctic, aircon is a BASIC necessity.

It is because the people nowadays have smaller family, some have 1 kid only, some no kids at all. So HDB decided no need to built so big flats anymore. So the flat size becomes smaller.
 
Same for kitchen, its getting smaller for new flats. Because people less cook at home nowadays, most prefer to eat outside or taobao...

Well i won't say every baby needs aircon.
 
But my baby sweats when she is sleeping. even in aircon. Her patches of sweat marks mark out my bedsheets.
She just simply sleeps better with aircon. Without aircon, her sleep is a bit restless. With aircon on, she sleeps more comfortably.

Wood is more like proper material for furniture. Aluminum, cast iron, and iron related should belong to outdoor furniture.
 
Even HDB now gives you wooden toilet door and not aluminium door.

Not true la. Both of my kids sweat easily. They can sweat while sitting down watching TV with the fan on. But then I never let them have aircon on for sleeping at night. They are still able to sleep throughout the night without much problems. 
 
I also sweat easily but I grew up without aircon in my room also.
 
At the start they didn't sleep very well. But as they got used to it, then no problem already. Cannot pamper them too much.

15k is a very reasonable budget for a premium new flat to get all those necessary reno done. However, my advice is, if really not needed, dont tear down any wall. You might regret later when your family plan changes or when you want to sell. 
 
Just keep to your original budget n you shd be fine. I have friends spending over budget by as much as 20k after they started adding a few "nice" additional works. Stay disciplined and you will enjoy your new home with lesser stress than your friends' nicer house.

After spending long time and undergo difficult route..
 
Some findings that I got, first, carpentry cost is really significant.. 
I even went to the extend of going factory but only find that some of them, are quoting in sgd.
 
The best deal I got So far;
customize kitchen carpentry 11.5ft long
Wardrobe, 6'
Master toilet cabinet
Cement work x 4.
altar, 4'
 
all custom made, rm8.5k
 
Air-con is half the price compare to Singapore but of course, warranty is invalid.

Varies person to person. i can notice the difference between sleeping in AC and not in my child. 
And she did go without aircon for almost 8-9mths before i finally installed a window casement AC for my in-laws house after the haze earlier this year.
She sleeps much better. less grumpy in the day.

It depends on circumstances. I remembered when staying at kampung, we didn't even have fans and we survived. Then, we moved to HDB flat, fan was a necessity. Even my parents who were against fans (according to them will get rheumatism) also need fan after moving to HDB flat. 
 
As years go by and moved into own flat after marriage, was thinking hard whether to install aircon or anot. Decided to go ahead since package already included and taking it out won't save much. And, it was the best decision. The wind/airflow in my estate seems to be too erratic. 
 
Was also on the same thinking that we shouldn't spoil our child for my first. So, we and the kid endured for more than half a year on fans. It doesn't help. Consulted doctor and was suggested to on the aircon instead on hot days. Problem solved.
 
I think aircon is the best invention in this century. 
 
Only those staying next to McRitchie and big water catchment areas can consider don't install aircon.

depends on how often you turn on, like me who hardly use, non inverted is cheaper though running cost is slightly higher, but still lower than upfront payout.

Like i said. Inverter system 1 vs non inverter. The inverter system will be much more quiet. U can go read about it.
Power wise for a system 1, the consumption i doubt is all that different.
 
The concept is that inverter systems once the temp starts dropping, it will activate the compressor to blow at partial power.
Non inverter will be either be at 0 or 100%. So it only does that when the thermostat reaches a maximum temp. So inverters keep the temperature more constant.

For non-invertor, it should cost about <$1 per day basis 8-hour usage.
 
Like almost everything, switching on consumes the most energy and incur the highest rate of wear and tear.

Nowadays isn't most doors are of a aluminum frame, but inside is either wood, glass (mirrors) or PVC or alkalick (don't know the spelling but a lot of cabinet doors uses this material)? No..?

Aluminum so expensive leh. Probably what you see is the pipings for aesthetic purpose. Better to stick with wood furnitures indoor especially bedrooms for peaceful rest.

in fact, wood is more expensive..
i'm talking about solid wood..
 
but the thing about it, even at solid wood level, it will 'curve'
hence i'm going for aluminum, plastic type .
 
now, my next headache is the hacking of the wall..

	the link i posted earlier on the build-in wardrobe is about the same price as Ikea, full height base on the existing wall, floor and ceiling, come with tempered glass and aluminum frame. Yah wood is quite costly, the contractor couldn't match the price if custom made.

The truth is the subcon also want to earn $ mah. U just want someone to hack the wall and patch up.
For them, they would need to arrange the transport and the banglas to go over just to hack a wall and patch the floor. Even if it's a simple job, it's low margin business.
 
most contractors only do this if it's attached to other deals for more business or they are really jiak ba nothing better to do type. At this time of the year which is the busiest time of the year, why would they bother.

Seriously dude, renovation itself is already headache enough. You want to start being anal about it, you gonna screw yourself, your partner, your family, your contractor and your puppies. Renovation is the first sign in most marriage that not everything is perfect and it is going to stay that way but those who accept it moves on.

Ok guys..
 
I’m new to this, virgin..
I just got my house keys last Friday.. it’s a premium flat at punggol MRT area..
Was nice until the contractor came in and gave me the pricing..
 
$15k for simple works..
 
Basically, I want to tear down a HDB wall and re-erect a new one at further away.
(this, already cost me $1.5k-2k). the re-erect portion can be bricks or just partition..  as we got no plans for it.
 
Then I intend to raise the flooring of kitchen for cabinet, washing machine, 2 x toilets..
 
Carpentry is really a major cost contributor..
My kitchen is 3.48m long and only have space for floor type..
 
I didn’t intend to engage any ID, I wish to be my own main con..
I also exploring the possibility of getting carpentry works in Malaysia.
 
Hence is there any tips for me.. 

My flat is coming soon and weekends now is visiting IDs or contractors....
Went to the reno roadshow a few weekends back in HDB hub. A few booths there only. Most those them has those package for around S$13k for 5rm flat. If you still haven't award the contract to anyone, i can take photos of the brochures and send to you.
 
SS15k is possible as my friend did his 5rm around this price. Basic reno but his contractor is his relative. If you want to be your own main con, you need to coordinate the job yourselve which means you need to take more leave from work so as to supervise the work on site.

Wah if like that stress than you better go get blood pressure pills and prosac liao.
 
But if you keep saying your budget is limited, perhaps you might want to scale back on the scope of work to be done instead of running around different parties (and countries) trying to get best deals, because that will make you pull your hair out.
 
You say wall must hack for altar, but because "so if 1 day, if i want dining table.. there's space..". If means right now it's not crucial to hack right? Let the one day come then say lah. Do what's essential for your family (and altar) to move in first, the rest of the things can slowly be done part by part.

in fact, wood is more expensive..
i'm talking about solid wood..
 
but the thing about it, even at solid wood level, it will 'curve'
hence i'm going for aluminum, plastic type .
 
now, my next headache is the hacking of the wall..
 
not many willing to quote for this portion only.

Mine is wood, but not solid wood. Casement doors, not sliding. 7 years already, still doing fine, no curve, no bend. Sliding is more expensive, iirc is $700 more. What for? It does not "save space". Actually it makes getting clothes in and out more peck check and it needs more space to erect your build-in wardrobe.
 
Maybe you should take those package kind, about 10-15K with aircon, cooker and hood in. Normally can negotiate abit, minus here, add there. The kitchen and washing machine base is not necessary for some people. So, can deduct off and use the savings for heckling wall, etc. As someone has pointed out, at this time of the year, it's not easy to get contractor unless you are willing to wait until their dry season (then you can whack them).

Any unoccupied buildings for a period of times will invite 'un-invited' guess. They will occupy empty space. The things I mentioned is to feed them with rice & salt first and later inform them that you are going to stay this house and thereby after feeding them, sprinkle the water with 'sey lew' leaves aka 'ang huay heok' starting from rooms and then to the main gate. Thereafter, ask your contractor to start work.
 
For throwing of pineapple, the word in hokkien is 'onglai or wanglai', luck come but if you don't chase 'them' away, how to expect 'wanglai'... 

 
thanks for the explantion bro.

guys..
 
wanna ask about paint this time..
 
i intend to go for perfect white for all walls and a bright orange wall (2.5m long) as a central attraction as it will be the area whereby i place my nicely sofa..
also intend to apply the bright orange wall on some corner of the toilets..
Maybe storage room and the corner of the service yard.
 
i did some search about the matt, satin, high gloss paint..
matt is nice but highly required maintenance and dirty easily..
satin seem to be the best of 2 worlds..
high gloss, high protection but will make the house too glossy..
 
the market got so many brands - dulux, jotun, nippon etc.. i think i be going nippon..
 
i also come to know that my parquet flooring, i can actually apply coating of varnish..
i'm going for satin grade too..
use for 5 years then change later date..
 
any views or recommendation to share..
 
update, from my initial budget, the cost overun..
likely to be hitting 15k..
 
till date spending:
Max coil queen and storage bed frame - $1250
full leather, incliner, $1400
hack wall and re erect, wet work, kitchen cabinet $4000
6ft wardrobe plus altar, $1200
ebay and ikea purchase, $600
kitchen appliances, $120
 
yet to buy:
system 1 air con
60' led tv
400L fridge
hob
7 kg washing machine
1 x heater
4 x ceiling fan
sound bar
robot vacuum

robot vacuum quite useless. save the cash bro.
 
dont recommend white walls. very easy dirty. from personal experience.
 
painting by contractor abt 1.5k for 5rm flat. inclusive paint.
 
i hired 3x blangra at $50 per day. and just buy the paint etc myself. total less than $500.
 
the rest of house items can get at warehouse sale. usually end of yr alot. I got at HN warehouse sale. but of course not latest models lah. but good enough.

yeah, robot vacuum actually not cheap.. the model that i like is nearly 1k..
 
don't go for white? what should i go for? both of us are very bad with colors..
the person who sold us the sofa, suggested matt white, hence we go for white..
 
basically, my sofa is grey in color.. blinds are black grey from ikea..
flooring is wood.. wardrobe and kitchen, are dark colors..
 
yeah, i got my source of painting job.. he will be painting plus varnish the whole house..
not forgetting the installation work of heaters and lighting..
should be a good price...
 
tonight will be going gain city..  gf's friend know the boss..

My contractor told me some of the paints are harder to "blend" with the original coat when you want cover marks/stains/handprints etc. Will be obvious unless you repaint the whole section of wall.
 
He recommended using lower end matt-ish paint and I'm happy with the results, particularly since I have dark, light and strong colours in the house. All turned out nicely and the final touch-ups blend seamlessly.
 
Dunno how true but I happy can liao.

60" TV? I know its tempting but HDB put 60" like a bit too huge? It is like almost occupying the whole wall and nowadays the living room so small.
 
Maybe can cut that part of the cost and use it on something else. if i'm you, i get smaller TV and a better aircon.

actually not really.. we been to a few units, all using below 60'.. it really looks cartoon..
 
my sofa is 2.1m long..
the wall behind sofa is 2.5m
 
for a 60', the dimension is 1358 x 786 x 67.2, actually can bigger is better..
 
i foresee, big tv is the next big thing to have at home..
plus our walls are pretty empty.. no console.. as everything is mount onto..

no choice..
 
beggers cannot be chooser..
if you want to save money, be your main con is the best..
identify the big spending tickets and work on it..
 
i agreed with you, planning ahead do helps a lot..
 
my wedding is dec end.. we already wasted 3 weeks by just talking and no action..
only this week, got actions..
hopefully, by next week, things should come to an end and start installing and painting

not exaggerating leh.. if you didn't have the reflective solar film, sure can see..
 
nowadays flat so close to each other..
 
if you think 60" will be the "in" thing in future, why not buy then? Afterall, electronics are not something you invest early on. let the price drop in the coming yrs then buy again also good mah.
 
I think 60" really a bit over kill. just my opinion :)

yup. so that's why we need to engage an engineer to determine the area of hacking is an "approved" area. and it wouldn't cause any structural damage.

I think maybe the terms are confusing because everyone say structural.
 
"Support" or load-bearing walls/beams/pillars cannot touch, that's "structural". Those hollow partition walls (non load-bearing) can hack but reno must be approved.
 
Tio bo?
 
Dun affect me cos i'm not the one with a new place, Kurty is. My place already got, reno done and no, I have no intention of selling after MOP is up. To me it's home, not a property to be flipped for profit.

an old model 2012,
3D 55' going for just 1.4k
while another newer 55' going for 1.6k
 
but my sound bar gonna be wider than them.. by 12cm.. meaning 6cm each side..
 
60' is still at 2.4k
65' is at 3k..
 
what would you go for?
 
a) save the 1K and go for the 3D model?
b) save $800 and go for non 3D model
c) KNN.. just wack 60'..
d) don't buy yet.. wait for the price to drop further

no need engineers.. the detail floorplan will show which one is structural..
 
If you want to ask ID , make sure you get the experience ones.. if they had done project with the similar layout. they will know.  Those inexperience will ask to get engineer.. or anyhow humdum.. I think both option is not what you want.
 
 
 
Re-sale flat.. very old ones.. maybe you need to remove.. re-do electric wires and pipes..
For BTO, just keep to the min.. given that everything is almost brand new. :)
Unless the size of the flat is not optimum.. e.g 5 ppl stay in 3 rm flat. .. dun need to hack here hack there..

matt white for ceiling.
Satin perfect white for all walls..
only a side, will reflect yellow.
something like this:
 

 
while rooms, the same..
except on the wall with the bed frame, we will go for a light tone of Grey.
 
basically, in living room, we trying to achieve a welcome environment..
while in bed room, cosy yet classy as the bed frame and furniture are in dark colors.

dun know.. but the last time my flat is consider high .. according to my ID.. still looks smaller for some of neighbours who decided on darker flooring...
 
unless you are the top flr.. i still suggest keep to light tone..
 
Although you may not be selling/ renting next time.. but light tone house will be more pleasing to "general" buyers/tenants.  
 
Parquet-flooring..hmm... do you intend to have children? if you do... be prepare to pay for polishing in the future..there is this new vinyl woodflooring.. i find it quite good.. prices is abt parquet.. and more duable.

8.5' ceiling I think quite normal bah. Mine is 8' can consider low.
 
I think your colours should be ok if you happy with that kind of vibe, at least you have one wall that pops out abit from the rest of the whiteness. I think the darker floor would work better with that, or else too much white, too sterile.
 
But then again my personal preferences lean towards monochromes and greys with dark blue in the bedroom. If you check Nippon's 2013 catalogue, all my ceilings are crystal blue, my bedroom walls are cosmic navy, all other walls are bright steel except for the tv wall which is a dark grey called mysterious.

Ahahaha not classy at all. Just my personal preference, most of my furniture is grey or black (even my fridge and washing machine). Some might call it industrial and maybe they're right, I was considering doing smooth bare concrete walls. I didn't touch flooring and keep in mind my place is <500 sqft.
 
Lousy image quality, all taken on my blackberry. Also excuse the mess, pics were taken during reno/moving-in. I think I sexpose myself with some of these pics, my friends might recognise.
 
This is what happens when a bachelor who also happens to be an overgrown child gets his own place and doesn't really care about what other people think.
 
TV wall (note stupiak antenna pipe on right side, hdb say cannot remove ccb)

 
Living room décor is my bicycle

Old flat bo pian, the flat older than me. I re-did all the wiring/trunking in the house but no false ceilings/walls to hide trunking because my ceiling is low and unit is small enough as it is. It's as neat and minimalist as possible given the circumstances. Also moved the air-con locations and changed to smaller trunking, the original trunking lagi jialat.
 
If you see the "before" pics you will laugh then start crying, the fookin wiring, trunking and décor was just a wtf situation.

Try not to use partition board for your wall if possible. Use brick or hollow block wall, its more expensive but results will be better. If partition may have fine crack lines at the joint area

Some people might decide to give up their chance because when their turn comes up, they find the units available don't meet their requirements/preferences.

if number of flats available is 1000 units, your Q number is 800 then sure can get a unit but depends on availability. If your Q number is 1100, you can check online that day to see if you got chance anot as some people will drop the application if they are not able to get the particular unit they want, or they just regret applying for this project or some other reasons.

Looking at the pics. The wall should be a L-shaped feature leading to the kitchen (?). Not really a waste of space. I could be wrong though.

Moving in is alright, especially if it's planned well.
 
The bitch part is cleaning the house after reno, prior to moving in. Dust and cement powder everywhere, no matter how many times you wash the place you can still feel it. And this is after the contractors do their washing/cleaning. Wash and wash and wash and then when you're moving in you still find sandy/dusty bits here and there.

Seems like if like what you have said, if queue number exceeded 100 or more, dont think there is any chance liao. Since dont think there will be 100 people infront give up selecting the flat. Unless flats available is 1000 units and my queue number is 1030, then still have some chance.

May still have chance one....its very hard to say.
 
As what Stratovarious as mentioned, check HDB online 1-2 days before your selection date, and see how. Don't give up so easily yet.

Hopefully still have chance. But does it mean even if there only left 1 or 2 units on the selection date, maybe all level 2, it is consider one chance already used up if i dont go ahead and make selection? Unless no units are available on the selection date, then still would not consider one chance used up?

True, two of my neighbours have moved out and then moved in two foreigners families!
 
Lol, so it seems like foreigners able to pay high COV. Locals only want to pay $1.5K COV if there is any. But foreigners money is not a problem!

A friend of mine sold his 15th floor (partial seaview) Marine Parade flat at $100K COV. When I said, "Wow!", he told me his neighbour one floor higher fetched a hefty $150K. Both transacted recently.

you know the feng shan CC? the ones that opposite the swimming pool..
 
very small and old 3 room flat, i think they sold the unit for 320k.. 1k cov..
waited 3 months.. cos no one wanna buy..
the first buyer, placed a $500 deposit then back out as he found a better unit
 
definitely, it don't look appealing to me.
i only like the windy part.

Overall the flats in bedok are very old. And if the 3 room flat is those corridor type, really not very appealing. Price for the flat still need $320K, not cheap either. Only the cov is low.

that's pretty cock. Minor errors definitely have. I'm still rectifying minor errors.
Mostly to do with carpentry and grouting.
But major errors is the responsibility of the ID to prevent.
 
my ID is pretty clear on where everything should be. walls have all the correct positions pointed out. 
Socket positions, where to run the wires. 
Height of things are all indicated on the walls.
 
holiday?
ID no holiday one lah. They only do take holiday during CNY cos all the chinese malaysians take break during then. so all the subcons not working. 
But chill lah. no point getting upset.
Just rectify and move on. It's like that one lor.

yeah, the wall there was for a good purpose.. we hack it in order to free more space in the foyer and allowing a dining table..
 
in case you don't know.. if the wall didn't move, you be having meals with your dining table leaning to the wall..
 
i saw all my neighbors having this problem due to space constraint..
 
plus i need another wall for the altar and fengshui leh?
i have to move this particular wall

 
 
i see a need for the wall, but since you are pushing it back to have more space, why you need to have such a thick wall, curious why can't it be a gymson board of 200mm thickness?

agree, you can still need skirting below, which i believe should be using waterproof material that can last, while wiring can be install inside the wall. 
 
i mean it defect the purpose of creating more space beside moving back the wall. i was just curious of course nothing wrong with that. But i also heard of some harmful chemical inside the gymson board but we are expose to them everywhere we go anyway

You can actually use Glass as a partition no need for Glass Tiles … They are thinner than walls, Can let in more light, Easy to Clean, Easy to Replace & Cheaper than erecting a wall … But hey, thats just me hor …

some tips when moving in...
 
Know the rules of moving ~ ~
● 1. Dun walk in empty handed
Moving day , when first walk-in, the hands must take some precious things. Holding a jewellery box, passbook, or carry $138 ( lifetime huat! ) red envelope, which is the first time into the new home, cannot go in empty-handed. This home represents the future will be very fulfilling, meaning more and more wealth.
 
● 2. No more construction after moving in
Before moving, you can try to compartment, hammering, what can be done. Once moved in, not to have  construction as much as possible. You can move things/furniture. If renovated is a must , then choose a auspicious date.

 
● 3. Families with pregnant women do not move
Be sure to move it, you can ask pregnant women be back home to live for a while, and so good after moving into their new homes. Pregnant women try not to participate in the process of moving. 
 
● 4. Want to choose an auspicious date, time must be forenoon
Selected day auspicious to see someday should move into the house, but also pay attention to family members whose Ba Zi clash, and move in another day. Try to move in the morning, as the sun before noon is when after noon is called Yin. Moving in the day as much as possible.
 
● 5. New home to "Fire Temple "
All the house lights to be lit for the first three days, and move in on the 3rd day. Bright three days and three nights mean, lit a fire , while Wang, the family began to thrive. On one hand  it will start to circulate air, bad Mei Qi also removed. "Fire Temple " originally refers to a house in the front cover, yet to be done in the land of fire similar to the groundbreaking ceremony. If we buy a house construction company, do not know how the other was doing, " Fire Temple." So before using the above method to do it yourself.
 
● 6. Day or dinner afterwards
Into the house that day treat, if the day is too busy, you can choose a day after the dinner. Or, after moving to a new home, often invite friends to tea is also available. Make home a little more prosperous popularity.
 
● 7. Should personally be present when moving
To personally present, not only to help clients move. Personally moving, then just know things are less likely to fall.
 
● 8. Day open Simmer dumplings sweet tea
Moving day " stove " must be fired, not cold stove. You can cook some sweet things, like sweet rice balls or sweet tea, eat sweet, seeking a festivity. Congratulations housewarming !
 
搬家的規矩知多少～～
●1. 不可空手入屋搬家的那一天，第一次走進去的時候， 手上一定拿一些貴重的東西。拿著珠寶箱、存款簿、或裝有138元(一生發)的紅包，也就是第一次走進新屋時，不可以空手走進去。表示這家裡未來會很充實， 財富越來越多的意思 。
●2. 入宅後不再修造施工還沒搬家前，可以儘量去隔間、敲敲打打、什麼 地方要做都可以。 一旦搬進去之後，儘量就不要再修造施工了 。搬東西可以 。 如果要再裝修的話， 就一定要擇日了。

●3. 家有孕婦不搬家一定要搬家的話，可以請孕婦先回娘家住一陣子，等搬好後才入新居。孕婦儘量不要參加搬家的整個過程。
●4. 要擇吉日，時間一定要午前選好的日子、吉日，看農曆上哪天宜入宅搬家，還要注意不要衝剋到家裡成員的生肖日。搬家時間儘量要在午前，因為中午以前是陽時，中午以後就叫做陰時。儘量在陽的時間搬家。
●5. 新屋要"火庵"搬進去之前的前三天，家裡的燈要全部打亮，亮三天三夜亮到你第三天搬進去，這叫火庵 。亮三天三夜的意思是，火一照亮，一方面旺了，家裡也開始興旺 。 一方面空氣也會開始流通，不好的霉氣也清除掉。"火庵"原本是指在蓋房子前，對在尚未動土的土地上做些火燒的類似儀式。如果我們是買建築公司的房子，就不知道對方當時是如何做"火庵"。所以才會用上述方法來自己做。
●6. 當天或事後請客入厝當天請客，如果當天太忙，可事後選個日子請客。 或者，搬了新家之後，常常請好朋友來泡茶也可以。讓家裡人氣更旺一點。
●7. 搬家時要親自在場要親自在場，不要只委託人去幫忙搬家。親自搬家的話，東西也才知道， 比較不會掉。
●8. 當天開火煮湯圓甜茶搬家那天"爐灶"一定要開火，不要冷灶。可以煮些甜的東西，像甜湯圓或甜茶，吃點甜，求個喜氣。恭賀喬遷之喜！

Yes, heard a master say mirror especially next to dining area is a no no in feng shui.

Ok guys..
 
I’m new to this, virgin..
I just got my house keys last Friday.. it’s a premium flat at punggol MRT area..
Was nice until the contractor came in and gave me the pricing..
 
$15k for simple works..
 
Basically, I want to tear down a HDB wall and re-erect a new one at further away.
(this, already cost me $1.5k-2k). the re-erect portion can be bricks or just partition..  as we got no plans for it.
 
Then I intend to raise the flooring of kitchen for cabinet, washing machine, 2 x toilets..
 
Carpentry is really a major cost contributor..
My kitchen is 3.48m long and only have space for floor type..
 
I didn’t intend to engage any ID, I wish to be my own main con..
I also exploring the possibility of getting carpentry works in Malaysia.
 
Hence is there any tips for me.. 

Firstly my congratulations to holding the keys to your new flat !!!  Its a new phase in your life and it sure feels good that you are about to take the 1st steps like your father did...
can show us your house with pictures ?

thank you, that thing is made of bricks..
Precisely.. we also wonder why HDB got such kuku designs..
probably they wanna divide the area...
by moving it, it allow us to have dining table..
 
i also didn't build any kitchen door, instead i divert the money to buy a chimney hood.

Mirror is divided to 2 Type,
1	
Obvious mirror 明鏡 (I will refer this as mirror) and 
 
2	Hidden mirror 暗鏡 .
 
Mine is under obvious mirror, with lighting on ceiling.
 
Read the following:
 
Q  What about a mirror and a dining room?
 
A  For the first, you should provide good lighting on your dining room. A well-lit dining room is best when its also spacious. Mirror reflects light and strengthens it.
For the second, putting a mirror which reflects the food on the table can bring about more food.
A large mirror in the dining room is extremely good feng shui. A mirror that is large enough to reflect the whole family as well as the food on the table can bring riches and health for the whole family, because food is the sign of riches and

Actually true but cos my unit small and i  need more storage so i use this big cabinet as additional store room cos my bomb shelter too small already
I believe those LVs already costs more than your TV console..
But i dont like spend much money on tv console. For LV or luxury brand i willing to pay more

one reason why this kind of TV console nowadays not so popular i think is because people always want to upsize their TV..
 
when the time comes, it will be a problem.
 
besides, the contractor must be saw your collections of branded bags thats why he go back sharpen his knife.

go taobao buy lights but curtain then ship by sea mail
1 month delivery time
tiagong charges are:
 
product price + 10% commission for taobao agent + $4 shipping per volmertic kg + $6 base charge for shipping
 
if you expert level, can ownself diy taobao, can save the 10% commission 
you can go an google edmw and see
there got people put up guide on how to diy taobao

 
If wanna buy urself from taobao i think must use AliExpress right?

i think so but i am not sure becuase i bought thru an agent
you can go edmw there,
there got instruction on how to buy yourself
 
i get an agent because of cheaper shipping rates even though there is a 4% agent fee on the value of the goods
 
for me the savings from shipping is more than the 4% agent fee
my agent charge (trading1.sg) charge
 
air shipping: 1st volmertic kg: $7, subsequent kg: $4
sea shipping: $230 for 1m3 which translate to $1.15 per vol kg (but min charge is $230)
sea shipping for more than $2000 worth of goods: $1 per vol kg, ie $200 per m3 (min charge $200)
 
vol kg = (cm * cm * cm)/5000
