anybody with experiences living in ground floor unit of condo or EC?
 

seem some bad press report about littering from the neighbours upstairs, how bout problems of insects, rats, ants etc, is it much worse than living on top floor?
 

also privacy, is it true that anybody can just peep into your home and you are not allowed to do any unauthorise renovations such as blinds, etc on your patio?
 

thanks for all feedback in advance.

Depends on condo....for littering issue, seems like it's much worse for those ulu mass market condo, as the residents or tenants there are not as civic minded...so far most of the condos i've been too are quite alright..

One of my friend's aunt live at the ground floor of the condo...

1st storey units have extra open space called a PES(private enclosed space) that is bound by a short 1m fence.
 

That extra space has not much security and privacy. Worst still litter from above floors. And since they are built at the same level as the outer area unlike new hdb flats, you have a privacy inssue as well. Hard to see in what way that extra space is an advantage.

I used to own one of these ground floor units with a huge patio. My tenant complained that the people upstairs throw all kinds of rubbish like tissue paper, cigarette butts, etc into the patio.  Falling leaves are also a problem as the area has a lot of trees.  You may think that these are really lousy people living upstairs but the people in the building are mostly white collar ang mor single/couple expats and this condo is located in District 10.  So really, it all depends on your neighbours. Wait till you see these so-called "civic-minded and educated" ang mor expat neighbours get drunk, hahaha good luck to you.
 

Before I bought it, I had a verbal approval from the MCST that I would be allowed to construct a retractable roof (design to be approved by them) over the patio to prevent such things from falling in.  I did not install the roof however, as the unit was just for investment and I couldn't be bothered to spend that kind of money for my tenant, haha.
 

Good thing was, the patio was right next to the swimming pool, really really close up, separated only by a thick tempered glass fence. Shiok man. Sexy living.

Big PES is very good for investment, because of the bigger total area of your unit.  PES is generally priced as 1/2 or 1/3 of the per square foot price of the built in area.  So you are buying at a much lower overall $psf than your neighbours who have totally built-in space except for one or two small balconies.
 

When you sell out in a big bull market like 2007, as you know, a rising tide lifts all boats.
 

For example your unit is around 2,000 square feet including PES.  If the property prices in your area generally increases by $1,000 psf, your profit is around 2,000 x $1,000 psf = $2 mill (before factoring in agent's commission, seller's stamp duty in recent times, cost of your legal, loan clawbacks, loan early repayment penalty, etc)
 

And that is how people made their big money through property.  I know guys who bought and sold big 4,000 square feet penthouses, profited $1-2 mill or so with every trade they made.  All you need is to buy at a certain $psf price and sell out only a little bit higher, so get in at the early to mid to late stages of the bull run also can. You won't be holding long term anyway. Only if you can stomach risk.

In my previous D.10 condo, neighbor on the ground floor with private enclosed space (PES) - which is right below all the balconies of the upper floor units, complained like crazy about litter falling onto their PES ... to no avail.
 

You think the FTs care?  They just throw!

i think there are pros and cons
 

Pros:

- bigger yard space, can hang laundry  
 

Cons:

- no privacy

- my neighbour had to put up those wire-meshed fences to keep out stray cats

- elephant feet neighbours from upstairs

I think depends on heng suay, who are staying above you, and how tall is the block.
 

I've been staying in my ground floor condo unit (with a relatively big patio) for 3 years, no problem so far.  There are only 4 units above me, so I know all the 4 neighbours.   So far I have not seen any litters, the most is some fallen leaves when it rains, doesn't bother me much because my own plants also have fallen leaves when it rains  
 

As for privacy, depends on how you manage it. I put plants along the perimeter so they can block off some views.  But i don't mind even if people outside see me watching tv or playing ps3  
 

TS, some of those horror stories are true, but not all ground floor units are like that, really depends on heng suay.  If you do up the patio nicely, like put an outdoor set, it can be a really nice place for social gathering.

I am also on ground level.  But my condo is low rise so very few units above anyway.  I am glad we are not near the pool or bbq pits where all the noise and action is.  Privacy is not a problem.  In fact, it feels like living in a kampung.  Neighbours kids would come and look for my kids to play.  Sometimes neighbour would call from the patio gate to borrow eggs or onions.
 

It is also less claustrophobic, just assume all the space outside is yours... without having to pay for it and no need to weed your garden !!

I guess it's up to the attitude of people living above you. We have 1 condo on the ground floor, with patio and even a bench. Neighbours above know better than to throw stuff down. Think the management didn't allow building of a shelter there.. oh well..but the advantages are good. can just walk out 10m to pool.

I am also on ground level.  But my condo is low rise so very few units above anyway.  I am glad we are not near the pool or bbq pits where all the noise and action is.  Privacy is not a problem.  In fact, it feels like living in a kampung.  Neighbours kids would come and look for my kids to play.  Sometimes neighbour would call from the patio gate to borrow eggs or onions.
 

It is also less claustrophobic, just assume all the space outside is yours... without having to pay for it and no need to weed your garden !!  



 

Agree! I treat the garden space outside the patio as mine, including the 3 trees, when I water my plants I also water them

The thing is, for the whole blk to have just one uncivic minded resident and it's enough. You will get rubbish and whatever falling down all the time.



 

That's why see heng suay, but chance of that happening in low rise condo is much lower than high rise condo, cos easier to identify

i live on the first level with 2 patios in the front and back. neighbor's kid always throw his toys out the window and landed on my patio, can't really enjoy chilling in the patio...i got fed up one day and threw his toys out of my patio.
 

i usually use the back patio for drying of clothes... neighbors upstairs throw water and rubbish down as it's the yard area. once i found a rusty penknife blade in my back patio. complain to management also no use when neighbors don't understand the danger
 

but of cos, living on the first level, you get to enjoy the larger space offered. can't help much with privacy as people walk past they will look into your unit.

nowadays got some patio the shelter cover nearly 2/3 of it, so the rubbish now lands on the 2nd floor unit.

but to the 2nd floor unit is okay coz they can't have a walk outside their windows anyway so no danger of killer litter.

ya.. got warranty.. and they will fix.. got one leak here, they come and patch. another leak there, they come and patch.. and it can go on for 10 years. 
 
 

developers and architects do not have to deal with this. it's the main con and their sub con.. 
 

new building,  old buildings..  all will face leaking issue coz no matter how well you control up to the person laying and doing the damp proof membrane, you will still have some weak point. 
 

The 1 year DLP and 5/10 years warranty on all the areas are there but when it come to invoking them, it's a challenge and it's also a hassle if they want to come and do it. 
 
 

It's like you buy a car with 5 years warranty but every now and then, you have to go back. you happy?

then from room go kitchen or living room, got to go out, take lift and come in next level?
 

when buying a unit, have to look at usable space, necessary space and those dead space.. 
 

so a staircase, when properly built can be more usable space than necessary space. 
 

those bay windows are dead space which have limited usage but people have to buy things as a package. 
 

there's really no best of both world.. and if have, there's a premium to pay for it

Do you notice that some developers create a subsidiary just for one development then wind up after project completion.   But architects and big main con cannot run.
 

But I still must say normally first 10 years no problem because its tested 2ice , once before waterproofing , once more after . But after bout 10 years our humid weather takes its toll then problems many many. If you have a penthouse and your roof is metal.... you have to replace the whole lot.

bay windows/ledges/planters were the biggest developer con jobs. glad that the authorities are clamping down on that. 
 

rule of thumb is to less min 10% of saleable area as actual usable area.

eh.. the create subsidiary thingy is not really a hit and run arrangement. from another angle, it cushion the buyer from other mishap that could cause the main company to fail. different set of account in a much simple explaination. 
 

as for the warranty, major problem seldom happen but there will be some mirror problem here and there.. and it's quite tiring to deal with it. it's like kick and kick, then move once.. 
 

and like your testing, it was ok before waterproofing, it's also ok with water proofing. but do they test again when they lay the final layer? Go thru most of the MCST in Singapore and many will tell you roof top leaking is common. 
 
 

but still got metal roof meh? for what? roast chicken?

If it's slopping and the flat area still have water proofing, i think it's acceptable. 
 

it's usually those stagnant water that is a killer.

Now i know.. Was looking at the ground floor unit of an EC.. Rather skip it then and get a high floor one.




it depends on the design, if the 'groud floor' unit is built higher than the surround common areas / foot paths / pool deck in such a way that passersby couldnt really see clearly into your unit and there's lush bushes etc to keep them at a distance such that they cant really hear you, the privacy issue may not be a serious one....

In my previous D.10 condo, neighbor on the ground floor with private enclosed space (PES) - which is right below all the balconies of the upper floor units, complained like crazy about litter falling onto their PES ... to no avail.
 

You think the FTs care?  They just throw!




one solution for the ground floor unit owner: put a retractable canvas roof painted with a big middle finger towards the upstairs neighbours............ with or without the retractable roof these maroons will drow anyway, might as well let them see the finger everytime they look out and throw...  

then quitely install a cctv opposite and capture the culprits red-handed on video...

Most semi-detached and small plot detached face this neighbour problem also, as the plots are just next to each other.
 

The best is of course a GCB, where your building footprint is limited to 40% of the land, thus rendering your neighbours further away.
 

But most of us can't afford GCBs.
 

So the next best thing to do is to look for detached, semi-detached and corner terrace at the corners of the block of land.  This will guarantee that you will have no neighbour on at least one side. And that is the side where you build your house facing.

There are many semi-detached and detached (small bungalow land) houses in the east coast that are only marginally better than inter-terraces. It is nightmarish, a so-called semi-detached and detached house having neighbours right next door on both sides so close to you. Every morning come out of your house can see sour black face on both left and right sides..... Do avoid those.

I though the title is Condo ground floor unit. 
 

Now most new condo comes with 2m shelter  to cover the patio, sounds like a good idea.

Some also come with ponds  or garden to give some privacy to the unit.
 

Guess these are the leas son learn from the older condos.

IMO, staying on ground floor of Condo is not ideal. Whilst there is some sense of feeing it's like staying in Landed, it is however far from it.
 
Lack of privacy as compared to Landed means that likely the occupant will draw their blinds and close the windows from prying eyes and that means natural air doesn't flow in so you will incur higher electricity bills.
 
Your PES would also be dirty from leaves, dust and possible litter from above which may include toe/finger nails, tissue paper and the odd cigarette butt.
 
Another issue could be possible BBQ smoke coming into your house and noise levels higher should you be unfortunate enough to be near the pits.
 
All in all, I would stay clear if possible, my 2 cents.

Tho i emphatize with the littering problem from higher up floors, problems arise whenever something savoury is thrown down on to the awning.. (attracting tons of ants) The question now arises to who's responsibility is it to clear the mess? from level 2, i can't wash it away as i would be essentially flushing the contents into my neighbour's yard .. 
 
faced with this un-fixable conundrum.. sold the house in 3wks..

how about installing a canopy ? It can somehow block some of the litter from upstairs, just that U will need a long broom to sweep away those stuff.
 
For pent house units, it gets freaking hot when the weather is hot even cold water becomes heated water ! To overcome, can consider laying carpet grass on the roof to bring down the temperature.
 
It is always the case of U see me good, I see you good.

I have been staying in a ground floor unit for about 1/2 a year liao, it really boils down to heng suay your neighbour upstair b**tard or not and if your mgmt ons or not when it comes to high rise litterbugs. I guess design of the building also plays a part as places with inaccessible planter recess area harder for ppl to litter.So far so good for me, i still get the occasional small things thrown down, but not often. But still need to spend more time cleaning the outdoor area because of all the fallens leaves and what not. But these are to me minor inconveniences for having the nice big outdoor space. Our dogs also get to roam about in the outdoor area. Our place allows us to build a canopy, which we seriously considered and KIV'ed by monitoring the littering situation, when we felt it wasn't so bad, we decided against building it because it would have made the inside of the house darker. So instead we just put in a big big umbrella and table from Crate & Barrel. But we also got ground floor neighbour not so lucky, a bamboo pole drop down and pierce their retractable awning. Police were called in. So is really havto see before you buy, look at the grounds and see if got any tell-tale signs of high-rise litterbugs.
 
So far no sexy bra or panty drop yet.

Yeah, it really depends on the development...ie the type of people staying there.
 
I like staying ground floor, been staying for 20 yrs. No luck for sexy bra or panties  , maybe I am lucky to have good neighbours above, so far no problem. Maybe the trick is to make friends with people staying above you...

I stay on ground floor unit as well... it has been over a year.
 
When I chose the unit, i did consider the surroundings. My unit is elevated from ground level, so the human circulation is a couple of metres lower and they cannot look in. And the landscaping also provides privacy. Of course i also chose the unit to be away from swimming pool, bbq pit, tennis court. It is rather quiet except for road noise.
 
The pros:
 
1. hardly needed to wait for lift. 
2. Can just walk out.. it gives a very chalet/resort feeling. Opposite me is the reservoir and i see people jogging all the time.
3. Good security in some way as CCTV cams are fixed on ground floor lobbies.
4. Condo allows us to build awning. So the huge PES is sheltered and I can put a full size outdoor sofa set and chill there at night.
 
The Cons:
 
1. I get quite a lot of insects /worms/millipedes/lizards coming in as the front of my unit is rather heavily landscaped. I suppose people staying landed will get same issue?
2. The occasional litter from above, and when people above wash their balconies, water did splash down from time to time.
 
 
Other than that... I do enjoy staying on ground floor quite a lot.

nowadays, you can easily erect those insects repellents stands (exacty like those gardens stand lamps at waist height). that will ward off majority of your pest problems.  as for the ground, the only way is to spend $ to replace them with good carpet grass..... of coz, you must have properly layered (sand, sheets etc.). and cleverly drainages to facilitate easy water flows when rain or doing your own cleanings.
lastly, I guess you can even installed CCTVs to catch highrise litters if any......
 
I too, enjoyed staying on the Condo's groundfloor . . . especially the corner ones like yours, away from the hustle & bustle while enjoying the privacy of open chats with guests etc. 
 
I even had my personal BBQ pit... I will switch on the giant stand fan during BBQ, and even offer to neighbours (especially 2nd floor above) and checking with them if they were disturbed by the smell or noises below etc.... the giant stand fan was also very very useful especially to our horrid hot weather.....
 
those were the days . . .

then you'll have chicken shits.... even inside your apartment.
then your neighbour will also complain about the morning calls too!
 
worms . . . . there's problem in your drainage or water ponding on your greens....
how big is the size of your green yards???  if its not, why dun you DIY by removing the soil and replace the top layers with sand or sheets and top by carpet grass.  else, the easiest way is to include more effective drainages.... one across all the corners of your greens or between patio . . . .   a small amount$ that brings marvellous enjoyment - its worth it......

..... nowadays, its very common like this ..... even c/w well-designed drain covers.....
easy to maintain or clean... just flush them off..... and water + whatever flow into the common drains.....

I have a ground unit. I never heard my tenant complained such problem. It is old but well maintained condo. The blocks there are only four storeys, design is such that the units become increasing smaller as it goes higher each floor. So only the unit directly above can litter on unit below's patio or balcony.

Just sharing on this topic (Ps this issue is not common)
 
I have a really old condo which was undergoing some en bloc discussions, located near some forested areas.
 
The Enbloc committee surprisingly was made up of residence living on the ground floor, apparently they were pushing for en bloc because their units were getting rat issues. Unfortunately En Bloc did not go thru so I hope they found a way around their issues.

Wondering whether those staying in ground floor units will close and lock their balcony doors every night when sleeping, or when going out of the house.
 
If close and lock at night, then it will be very stuffy inside the unit, and sure must use aircon? 
 
While condos have security guards and are supposedly safer, it might still not be safe to leave the balcony doors wide open at night right?

yes, i lock my balcony doors every night, cos someone stupid enough can definitely climb into my balcony and make their way into my house if they really want to.
 
anyway, i have a proper alarm system with motion detector installed, the sin chew alarm box is placed at the  point where someone can jump into my balcony. its enough of a deterrent since so far - my neighbor's house has had 1 trespass and i have had none.
 
$2k is a small price to pay for peace of mind (all of my windows, doors have triggers and even opening up the toilet window will sound the alarm if it is armed)

not sure, but ill definitely ask the next time i see. basically, someone has also climbed over my balcony once, but because they dropped something there. i was at home at the time and gave the mofo a piece of my mind. he could have at least had the courtesy to ring my door bell before jumping over. the common area to my patio is a waist high wall, so after that incident, my wife moved all of her plants to block anyone from climbing over. i mean literally, that corner is like a jungle now

last time pillow case(iirc) dropped down. i just put in plastic bag, bring to lift lobby and stuck a note at eye level - "is this your pillow case?" with a arrow pointing downwards. think someone claimed it after few hours.
 
i dont mind to help people one ... but i still havent found the CB who threw curry down. there was food in the pool, food in the common area, and my awning and patio covered in curry. seriously, if i can figure out the bugger, i will give him a swift kick in the balls for making my life hell for a week
 
wah i wrote such a long email to mcst with pictures, and they sent a warning to all residents next time police will be called. and immediately the problem stopped.

Sound waves are longitudinal waves. If at the same block grd floor is noisy, it wld probably be the same if not worse higher up. Reason being higher up no blockage of the noise whereas lower floors, noise maybe blocked by trees etc...eg you,ll notice that traffic noise is terrible the higher you go

My place used to have swimming classes for kids on Sunday morning, but only for one month I think. Probably some residents complained, because the lap pool is in between 2 rows of condo units,  half the units here could be affected by the noise. After that the mgt administered a survey asking if it is ok to allow swimming classes at certain timings, iirc 12noon to 2pm on Sundays and Saturday mornings. I believe it wasn't supported because I don't see the classes being held again. 
 
I am also staying at ground floor. Wasn't really affected by the noise from swimming classes but I think some residents jio their friends and relatives (don't think they are residents) to join in, in the end the classes were very big and lots of parents hanging around to wait. With a lot of outsiders around, it is not too comfortable for residents. And residents who want to swim at that time will not be able to do so, the classes were back-to-back for about 3 hrs on Sunday morning.
 
My patio is about 90% covered so no issue about littering. It's a good place to enjoy breeze and peace when there is no rowdy kids jumping and screaming in the pools. Many parents just let their kids run wild at the pool for hours, sometimes I can even hear them screaming at the kids' pools, which are fortunately quite far away and blocked by blocks of units. 
 
The condo environment is very relaxing and resort-like but some residents/visitors are simply inconsiderate. Luckily after about 1 yr after TOP, visitors and pool users reduced greatly.

Thanks. I am being quoted 230 per sqm for normal alum and 280 for fire rated one.
 
My patio is quite huge (compared to the rest in my estate) so it will cost me about 10k.

Wow, yours at least 40sqm. Swee :)
 
Mine three quarter originally came with cover, so only need to cover a bit more.
I left a corner space uncover to have a 天井 for better ventilation.

I do not have such issue, may be because I Hv herd plant around my place to naturally keep these insect away. Also mcst on the ball on mozzy control :)
