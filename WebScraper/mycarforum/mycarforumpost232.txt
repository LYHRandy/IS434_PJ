Private-property prices fall sharply in core area  

This suggests that some home buyers became more cautious after the additional buyer's stamp duty took effect in December. 
 

Thu, Feb 09, 2012

my paper 
 

By Reico Wong
 

THE property cooling measures introduced late last year have started to show a significant impact on the housing market.
 

Prices of private apartments and condominiums have dropped by as much as  10.2 per cent   in the Core Central Region since the fourth quarter, suggesting that home buyers became more cautious after the additional buyer's stamp duty took effect in December.
 

The average selling price of such units has fallen to $1,600 per sq ft (psf) from $1,781 psf in the fourth quarter, according to data released yesterday by the Singapore Real Estate Exchange (SRX).
 

The rental prices of apartments and condominiums have also been affected, with those of properties in the non-central areas hit the hardest.
 

The rental rates of units outside the central region have fallen 2.3 per cent since the fourth quarter, from $2.99 psf to $2.92 psf.
 

However, rents for apartments and condominiums in the Core Central Region are still climbing. They have risen 1.3 per cent since the fourth quarter, from $4.68 psf to $4.74 psf.
 

This is likely to be just the start of a downtrend, the heads of property agencies said yesterday at a housing forum organised by SRX. They added, however, that a price crash is unlikely.
 

Private-property prices are expected to drop between 10 and 15 per cent this year, said Dennis Wee Group, HSR Property Group, PropNex, DTZ, ERA Realty and C&H Properties.

Prices of Housing Board resale flats are likely to ease between 3 and 5 per cent this year, but could also fall by as much as 10 per cent if the euro-zone debt crisis worsens, the companies said.
 

Mr Albert Lu, chief executive of C&H, said population growth - especially that of permanent residents and new citizens - is slowing, leading to a fall in housing demand.
 

He added that HDB prices have doubled over the past six years and are unlikely to climb steeply soon, given the large number of Build-To-Order (BTO) flats being pumped into the market.
 

He said the attractive prices of BTOs would draw buyers from the resale market following remarks by National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan that he is looking into letting second- timers buy BTO flats.
 

When second-timers buy BTO flats, they will have to sell their flats, which would further "dampen demand", said Mr Lu.
 

PropNex CEO Mohamed Ismail said buyers now enjoy more choice, with some 5,000 executive-condominium (EC) units slated for construction this year and "a continued supply of government land sales".
 

There will be "supply, supply and more supply, be it of HDB flats, EC units or mass-market properties", he said.
 

"I would not be surprised if public- housing prices remain the same, five years from now," he said, adding that they might be only about 10 per cent higher at most.

Purchases of private property by foreigners reached historic highs last year, hitting 31 per cent, a two-fold increase from 10 years ago, according to another report released yesterday by Savills.
 

Mainland Chinese were the top buyers, making up 28 per cent of all purchases by foreigners, with Indonesians accounting for just 18 per cent of all foreign purchases.
 

Mr Lee Sze Teck, senior manager of research and consultancy at Dennis Wee, said: "Singapore is still one of the best cities in Asia to put your money. If prices drop about 10 per cent and conditions are favourable, buyers will definitely come back."

Residential property prices ripe for correction: Credo
 

SINGAPORE - THE odds seem stacked against residential property prices in Singapore, historical data compiled by Credo Real Estate shows.
 

Notably, negative residential price corrections were reflected in the years 2008, 2000 and 1983 following several quarters of price moderation to levels close to zero - a pattern which became apparent in the final quarter of 2011.
 
 

Slowing to a meagre 0.2 per cent from 1.3 per cent in the previous quarter, the residential property price index for the fourth quarter of 2011 seemed supportive of the view that current values are nearing their apex.
 

More worryingly, the fall in prices tended to coincide with periods of negative GDP (gross domestic product) growth or deteriorating economic conditions, which in most cases evolved into recessions.
 

Said Credo Real Estate's executive director and head of research and consultancy, Ong Teck Hui: 'If a recession occurs this year, it will certainly lead to a correction in the residential market. Even if a recession does not occur this year but economic conditions deteriorate ultimately leading to a recession, the market is also likely to correct.'
 

The debate over when the correction will take place has been going on for a while, with many analysts arguing that property prices would weaken this year as a result of economic uncertainty, mounting supply and cooling measures by the government. However, the situation could look a lot brighter if Singapore manages to escape with a mild slowdown.
 

'If economic conditions turn out to be better than expected, we are likely to see a fairly stable market, albeit with uneven performance amongst different market segments and with price adjustments within a narrow range,' said Mr Ong.
 

In particular, the suburban primary mass market could stay 'relatively healthy' due to firm underlying demand should a recession be averted, though the secondary market, which is experiencing weaker volume, could face a wave of price moderations.
 

Slower activity in the prime residential segment is also expected as foreign buyers take time to come to terms with the additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD).

i tried last week, the seller gave me the finger and say he would use the  100,000 k to 200000k  discount and pay a gal $10,000 per month for 20 months before selling the house and by the end of 20 months the market might be better or just use the house to keep a long term mistress then sell it to me.

I believe so.
 

Outer region, core region, whatever region...unlikely the price will crash up to 30% if rental rates do not fall..prices of property is always pegged to how much rental it can fetch.

I tell you..ABSD means nothing to most foreigners.  They want a safe haven for their cash, they don't care about returns for they already have biz providing them cashflow.  As long as their offshore assets are protected whatever level of ABSD is levied they will pay.

You're right, 10% tax on investment is nothing for those from the mainland.

Those that are cheering about the price drop, obviously they're too poor to own any property currently.

What make them think they can afford should the price drop further?

Why property prices will remain high
 

Updated: 20120131 ST - 
 

THE report ('Record number of homes to be built, further easing prices'; last Saturday) quoted experts forecasting a steep decline in home prices of up to 15 per cent this year. This was based on a drop in transactions last month and a record supply of 77,089 uncompleted homes at the end of last year, of which 39,184 remained unsold.
 

And in the public housing market, an overwhelming supply of 25,000 units will be released, on top of last year's batch of 25,000 units, which is unprecedented in recent years.
 

Despite the large incoming supply and cooling measures, which will put pressure on home prices, an excessive price fall is unlikely because of current strong fundamentals.
 

What is also vital to consider is the equally huge demand backlog in private and public housing.
 

Between 1995 and 2010, there was strong population growth amid an undersupply of housing. This led to a dire imbalance, which resulted in robust home transactions and escalating prices in recent years. 
 

Based on official data, the population of citizens and permanent residents expanded by 758,200 in the 1995 to 2010 period. But the increase in available private homes within the same period was only 128,896. 
 

Working on 3.5 persons per household, 758,200 equates to 216,628 households. So, as of December 2010, there was a housing deficit of 87,732 (216,628 minus 128,896).
 

This strong pent-up demand can easily absorb the 77,089 uncompleted homes in the pipeline until 2015. And this is not taking into account the housing requirements of new immigrants, who may need about 20,000 to 30,000 homes from now until 2015. 
 

Last year, 107,000 foreigners were added to the population. According to some experts, a 1.8 per cent population growth will most likely support home price growth in a favourable environment.
 

Currently, the property market is well supported by favourable key fundamentals such as low interest rates, low home vacancies, future population growth and the spillover effect from an imbalance in the resale HDB market.
 

All these factors will contribute to a positive impact on the residential property market in the coming years.
 

In the absence of a severe global economic recession accompanied by massive job losses, a sharp property price correction is highly unlikely this year.

So in essence, all prices are inter-twined. IF CCR comes down there will be pressure for OCR and RCR to also come down, which is not the case now. Why not buy a Holland, RV or Newton FH if anyone is willing to sell 1500 psf?

If central location fall from $1800 to say $1400.. why wouldn't faraway neighbourhood LH99 fall from 1200psf to $1000 or even 800/900psf? Hdb value will also drop from 600k per unit to maybe 400k? Strange views of property prices from alot of potential property buyers in car forum..

I would agree that valuation from valuars have dropped. In june11, my property valued at 1.4+mil, in nov, one valuar gave 1.6mil, last month 1 valuar give 1.35mil.. so much fluctuations.. but it wouldn't affect me as i dun intend to sell off anything below 1.45m as i bought it early 2010 for much cheaper price. Currently its rented out for 3900/mth so will just sell few years later while saving up the rental maybe 2-4years later. Its like buying bank share at $6 n share price now $9.. if share dividend if 7-8%, even if never sell off at $9 n it fall to $6 again also doesn't matter lah..

i always wonder how valuers work?
 

like my case, the last done was still $x but the valuer values it $x -$y.
 

when market is rising they would have use the last done price of $x.  but when sentiment creeping down they can introduce an arbitral estimate of $y to discount off the last done price?  really interested to know how they arrive at $y.

My take is that all these guys are missing the point..

House prices will drop when interest rates go up. 

When the marginal buyers can no longer comfortably afford the monthly installments, then you will see prices drop across the board. 
 

Like another bro said, rental also another significant factor, for investor-owner.

Obviously, interest rate will impact investor-owners as well. 

For occupier-owner, the only thing that will impact is interest rate. Period. 
 

Reason being, most SG-reans buy things on huge leverage.  

80% loan, 90% loan, 35 yr loan, as long as people can afford the installments, they think they can afford it. 

Very few are like Throttle. 
 

They do not consider the impact of rising i/r. 

I know some ppl who earn combined gross income of maybe 12-15K and stay $1.7M condo. 

Price drop a bit, they dun care, as long as they can pay installments. 
 

Once i/r rise and money becomes tight, thats when they will start to sell. 

So i/r is the largest determining factor, amongst others.

the worrisome trend is that foreigners account for 30% of all new sales. If this persists, will Singies accept that 1/3 of all private properties are foreign landlords? From political view, i dun thk this is acceptable. SG is not a place for rich foreigners to landbank...

So in essence, all prices are inter-twined. IF CCR comes down there will be pressure for OCR and RCR to also come down, which is not the case now. Why not buy a Holland, RV or Newton FH if anyone is willing to sell 1500 psf?



 

Yes, CCR/OCR/RCR prices are related. But it is more strongly influenced by the renal yield it can fetch.
 

Usually the gross annual rental yield of a private property will be around 4% +/- of the price of the unit.
 

There are FH walk-up apartments in Novena (<300m) walking distance to Novena MRT/Novena square right now that you can get for around $1.2K psf.

$1400psf punggol property with size of 1000sqft cost $1.4mil.. what r u talking abt? U are saying $1.4mil cannot get property or no property at shenton cost $1400psf? If its later, u r right.. shenton way dun cost $1400psf.. if u mean $1.4mil cannot buy anything in cbd, then u r wrong.. can buy, just not 1000sf.. u say must compare apple to apple mah.. so i say i dun understand what u talking abt.. comparing cbd to punggol is not apple to apple..



 

Compare size la..you compare PSF for what? PSF is just mathematics only.... if you find one 1000 sq ft in Orchard or CBD brand new for $1.4m let me know.

My take is that all these guys are missing the point..

House prices will drop when interest rates go up. 

When the marginal buyers can no longer comfortably afford the monthly installments, then you will see prices drop across the board. 
 

Like another bro said, rental also another significant factor, for investor-owner.

Obviously, interest rate will impact investor-owners as well. 

For occupier-owner, the only thing that will impact is interest rate. Period. 
 

Reason being, most SG-reans buy things on huge leverage.  

80% loan, 90% loan, 35 yr loan, as long as people can afford the installments, they think they can afford it. 

Very few are like Throttle. 
 

They do not consider the impact of rising i/r. 

I know some ppl who earn combined gross income of maybe 12-15K and stay $1.7M condo. 

Price drop a bit, they dun care, as long as they can pay installments. 
 

Once i/r rise and money becomes tight, thats when they will start to sell. 

So i/r is the largest determining factor, amongst others.




like!
 

Just keep quiet and go shopping in the next "few good years"...

Guys, you all not fair leh.
 

I was the first guy to say that property will face a correction in Q4 2011. I said that in July/Aug 2011.
 

Then you guys all say I nuts...not possible. I say just remember my posting and we see what happen come early 2012.
 

Now you all copy and paste such news from everywhere. Then all the property experts start giving interview like as if they predicted long ago.

some believe this correction is healthy for the market

because nothing moves in a straight line
 

in all history, property and equity are the only two classes of investment that have over time outperform other investments
 

you must be credited for having the guts and conviction to write it down

You're right, 10% tax on investment is nothing for those from the mainland.

Those that are cheering about the price drop, obviously they're too poor to own any property currently.

What make them think they can afford should the price drop further?

If central location fall from $1800 to say $1400.. why wouldn't faraway neighbourhood LH99 fall from 1200psf to $1000 or even 800/900psf? Hdb value will also drop from 600k per unit to maybe 400k? Strange views of property prices from alot of potential property buyers in car forum..



 

The overall quantum plays a very crucial role too. Say both are properties of 1000 sq feet. A CCR property at 1500 psf would fetch $1.5 mio while a suburban condo at  1200 psf would be $1.2 mio. This 300k difference is a whopping 25% of the suburban  condo. 
 

Although the 300 psf difference might seem small, the difference can be quite substantial while taken into context of the property size.
 

So even though the CCR prices might have fallen, the demand for outside core region projects might still be strong simply because it is not easy for most people to pay 25% more.

yeah.....trust them to arrive at a finite valuation like that?
 

i alway think valuation makes more sense when in a range but then that will be open to abuse (borrow higher quantum by chosing the higher end etc).
 

the most amazing thing is developer selling price always significantly higher than secondary sales and yet valuers always can do a matching valuation for developer selling unit and for secondary sale unit, they always take the more conservative stand ie cap at last done price or even go below last done if they think sentiment weakening.

for the valuation to be able to match, i really have my doubts.
 

but i half suspect i know the answer - developer owns all the unit in the project, so all the comparable units are priced consistently by the developer.  as long as it is consistent basis (even if consistently high), they have a basis to value?

I'm not a valuer but maybe i can offer some clues as i get to work with valuers every now and then:
 

For new and old projects, valuers will use 'suitable' comparables PLUS (subjective) judgement to arrive at a value.
 

For new launches, it is quite common for developers to 'explain' to valuers why their projects command a premium over other similar units in the area (and also 'explain' why valuers should heed their advice if they want the developer to continue knocking on their doors)
 

As valuation is recognized to be an art, it is professionally acceptable if values differ by up to 10%. For a $1m house, that would be $100K difference. For $200m building, the difference can be $20m...

Banks are always happy to loan (same as Casinos   , they want you to play). So long as the value does not differ too much, they will match and extend the loan. Its a safe bet... with the property as collateral. All pakart and happy

haha ok, that's about confirms my suspicion.
 

there is an amount of business goodwill factored into the valuation price.
 

and as to what projects are comparables, it is also judgemental in nature.  one valuer will differ from another due to this judgemental aspect.

Not really true... banks also very scared to loan if they have a bearish view of the mkt.
 

Know of someone who wanted to purchase a freehold shophouse in river valley back in 2009 (before the market rebound).
 

Asking was about 900psf and Bank's valuation was $400+ psf! So they only offered to lend up to max 35% of the asking price.
 

So in downturn, banks will exacerbate the freefall by reducing valuation thus preventing genuine buyers from buying thus forcing seller to further lower his asking price to find buyers

Banks finance developers, if project cannot sell, there is concentration risks. If project is sold to a diversified pool of end buyers, risks drop a few folds.  Hence banks financing such project have vested interest to finance the end buyers, even if $/psf is high as it is lesser of 2 evils. 
 

Developers are valuers' largest customers via their marketing arm, Banks also big pay master to valuers (mortgage business), all their interests are aligned... you rub my back and I rub yours.  Hard truth.

 loving this scene...hoping it to fall further...  




this is not good news for existing property owners ; good news for first timers?
 

when govt tries to cool the market and even bring prices down, they hurt some but please others.  
 

basic housing eg HDB flats etc should not be subjected to booms and busts likely to be caused by 'free market' forces.... other than that, maybe its ok to let 'fm' forces influence non-basic housing types?  this way, those who just want a decent roof over their heads, they can own HDB flats, others who want something more or 'play' the market, go for non-baisc properties?  

just for discussions: should the max value of 'basic' housing type be capped at say approx 5 yrs of annual combined income of a family for low-middle income groups? HDB then builds flats using this price-cap and come out with 3bedroom designs ?

Most of us have one property. The one we are sleeping in tonight. It does not matter unless I am looking to upgrade/ downgrade.
 

The only ones affected are the newbies setting up homes (bec HDB does mkt-rebate pricing), upgraders and property speculators/ investors.

Not really true... banks also very scared to loan if they have a bearish view of the mkt.
 

Know of someone who wanted to purchase a freehold shophouse in river valley back in 2009 (before the market rebound).
 

Asking was about 900psf and Bank's valuation was $400+ psf! So they only offered to lend up to max 35% of the asking price.
 

So in downturn, banks will exacerbate the freefall by reducing valuation thus preventing genuine buyers from buying thus forcing seller to further lower his asking price to find buyers




Hmm... could be because its a shophouse? But having said that, I'm waiting for the day when they de-valued their valuations!

Main stream  property jornalise if tend to write negative article is simply breaking their own rice bowl.

They  do that only because they still treasure their reputation.
 

It is the high end, CCR and should also be developer , this leading small group always a price down first . The   secondary market, mass market, EC, public HDB  making 95% market  will lag. Singapore SEasia market also lag behind HK .china property maket which started a down trend about 4 month ago. 
 

HK/china is deepening its downtrend today after 4 month point to singapore property  market should continue the downtrend in the forseeable future.  HDB uncles and aunties will realise it in 6 months time when mass market experience a price down.

i always wonder how valuers work?
 

like my case, the last done was still $x but the valuer values it $x -$y.
 

when market is rising they would have use the last done price of $x.  but when sentiment creeping down they can introduce an arbitral estimate of $y to discount off the last done price?  really interested to know how they arrive at $y.



 

Its all desktop valuation based on past transacted prices.  And it all depends on which banks (foreign banks tend to be more prudent and some local banks, not all, are very very hgungho) do you go ask for the valuation and whether you are buyers or sellers.  If you are the seller the bank tends to give you very aggressive valuation.  Recently, I have personally experienced a situation where the seller asked for $1.2mio (backed by bank's valuation) and my banks' valuations are much lower by between $150K and $220K. This is a whopping 18%  difference in valuations.

My take is that all these guys are missing the point..

House prices will drop when interest rates go up. 

When the marginal buyers can no longer comfortably afford the monthly installments, then you will see prices drop across the board. 
 

Like another bro said, rental also another significant factor, for investor-owner.

Obviously, interest rate will impact investor-owners as well. 

For occupier-owner, the only thing that will impact is interest rate. Period. 
 

Reason being, most SG-reans buy things on huge leverage.  

80% loan, 90% loan, 35 yr loan, as long as people can afford the installments, they think they can afford it. 

Very few are like Throttle. 
 

They do not consider the impact of rising i/r. 

I know some ppl who earn combined gross income of maybe 12-15K and stay $1.7M condo. 

Price drop a bit, they dun care, as long as they can pay installments. 
 

Once i/r rise and money becomes tight, thats when they will start to sell. 

So i/r is the largest determining factor, amongst others.

+ jobs + rental rate, which is a function of demand and supply but I agree with you interest rate is the most direct "lever" to a gradual market correction and recovery, bar a deep recession or SARS like event hitting town.   
 

US interest rate is at historical low but US housing is still in a doldrums due to the masive oversupply.

Home prices go up, but sizes go down
 

11 Feb 2012

Straits Times

THE prices keep going up but the median size of private homes has been rapidly shrinking as home buyers try to stretch their dollar further.
 

Developers are driving the trend as they downsize homes to keep them affordable even though the prices per sq ft (psf) have been increasing.
 

The shrinkage has been marked with the median size of all new homes sold last year falling to 904 sq ft - 26 per cent less than the median 1,216 sq ft just two years ago, according to an analysis by consultancy CBRE of caveats lodged.
 

Experts add that a typical three-bedroom unit has been whittled down from about 1,100 sq ft to 1,300 sq ft five years ago to about 1,000 sq ft.
 

Shoebox apartments of 500 sq ft and less are also likely to have brought the median home size down as they have been gaining in popularity in recent years. 
 

They usually go for under $1 million and attract mostly investors.
 

Sales of such units have shot up from 300 in 2008 to 1,900 in 2010, or from 6 per cent to 12 per cent of developers' sales over the same period.
 

Mr Colin Tan, research head at Chesterton Suntec International, said it is 'alarming' to note that half of all new homes sold last year were 904 sq ft or smaller.
 

'Unless all of these units are popular due to lifestyle changes...the data reflects how much damage has been inflicted on our physical real estate by high property prices,' he added.
 

'I expect average sizes of sold units to continue getting progressively smaller as long as market price levels remain high.'
 

Big units are also likely to command a premium in the longer term as there will be fewer of them, Mr Tan noted.
 

Mr Ong Teck Hui, head of research and consultancy at Credo Real Estate, said there has been a definite trend towards smaller units, especially in recent years.
 

In 2005, units up to 1,076 sq ft comprised 35 per cent of new private home sales, but last year that figure jumped to 65 per cent. 
 

Affordability is a major factor in the shrinking of floor areas, he said, with home prices surging 74 per cent from 2005 to last year. 
 

'Back in 2005, one could buy a new 1,100 sq ft to 1,200 sq ft three-bedroom suburban condo for $500 psf to $600 psf. Today's rate for a comparable unit would generally be upwards of $900 psf, making bigger floor areas less affordable than before,' Mr Ong noted.
 

Mr Tan Kok Keong, OrangeTee's head of research and consultancy, said lifestyle changes, like more singles choosing to live on their own, could have led to smaller homes.
 

'But the trend of shrinking homes might be reversed if property prices fall, allowing developers to build larger homes instead while keeping overall prices steady,' he added.
 

He noted that the median of 904 sq ft is just slightly smaller than a four-bedroom Housing Board (HDB) flat, which is usually 90 sq m to 95 sq m - or between 969 sq ft and 1,023 sq ft.
 

Private home sizes cannot keep getting smaller as there is a limit to how much home buyers, such as HDB upgraders, might be willing to trade size for private condo amenities, he said.
 

Home values have been generally rising on the back of the property market's recovery from the global financial crisis in 2009.
 

Median prices reached $1,194 psf in 2010 before dipping slightly to $1,125 psf last year, possibly due to an increased number of suburban homes sold compared with those sold in 2010.
 

But while the number of new homes sales in 2010 and last year exceeded the number in the previous record year of 2007, they were well below the total transaction value of $24.5 billion in 2007. 
 

Experts say this is because 2007 was a year when the high-end and luxury market peaked and thousands of expensive homes in districts 9, 10 and 11 were snapped up.
 

On the other hand, it was the mass-market segment, with typically lower quantums, that powered the property market in the past two years.
 

IMPACT OF HIGH PRICES

Change of focus for property investors
 

11 Feb 2012

Straits Times

THINK of property investment, and most people think of residential properties.
 

But more individuals and investors are being drawn to industrial and commercial properties as an alternative place to park their investment cash.
 

This growing group of buyers accounted for up to half of sales at some newly launched commercial projects.
 

One factor may be that these purchases are exempt from the recently announced additional buyer's stamp duty, though other charges apply.
 

Not surprisingly, business operators still make up the bulk of buyers of factories and other commercial and industrial property but investors are showing more and more interest.
 

For example, at Primz BizHub, an industrial project in Woodlands, The Straits Times understands investors account for 30 per cent of the sales.
 

More than 150 of the project's 380 factory units have been snapped up since marketing of the project started early last month, with units transacting at an average price of $390 psf.
 

Units range in size from 926 sq ft to 2,590 sq ft, with the smallest 926 sq ft unit costing $351,880.
 

Paya Lebar Square has seen investor interest inch up since sales of its strata office units started in December last year. Investors account for 52 per cent of sales so far at the 99-year leasehold project. The rest have been bought by businesses for their own use.
 

The stronger interest from investors has helped to drive the price slightly higher. The average selling price stands at $1,710 psf, a $30 increase from the last reported price.
 

EL Development chief executive Lim Yew Soon said his Eldix project in Mandai has also seen a recent rise in investor interest as more individuals or groups of individuals buy units. 
 

Of the 40 units sold so far, investors account for 20 per cent of the transactions, up from the 10 per cent to 15 per cent recorded in late December. 
 

Even businesses which buy industrial and commercial property could be using the space for investment purposes.
 

Mr Rocky Lau, managing director of Cutter Technologies, bought two 1,160 sq ft units at Primz BizHub for about $380,000 each in anticipation of future expansion.
 

'But we have to look at the timing of the market. If it's not good, then we can always rent out the space and use it for investment.'
 

Industrial and commercial property may be exempt from the additional buyer's stamp duty but buyers have to pay a 7 per cent government service tax.
 

Also, they cannot use their Central Provident Fund to offset the property purchase.
 

Analysts point out that the lower cash outlay required to buy strata industrial and commercial property is one big draw for investors. It is possible to snag a unit for less than $500,000, depending on factors such as the location and type of building.
 

Such deals are rare in the private residential segment, with homes more likely to start above the $1 million mark.
 

Rental yields are another attraction, with some industrial and commercial spaces touting an estimated yield of 6 per cent to 8 per cent, significantly higher than the 2 per cent to 3 per cent return on investment for residential property.
 

But higher returns come with bigger risks, said Mr Nicholas Mak, head of research at SLP International. 'Residential properties may have a lower yield but such properties can tap into a bigger pool of potential buyers and usually have good capital appreciation,' he said.
 

'Industrial and commercial property will also be the segments that get hit the hardest when there is a prolonged economic downturn.'

Bungalow market starting to move again 
 

Agents report increase in number of viewings, sellers becoming more receptive to offers 
 

By KALPANA RASHIWALA 
 

AFTER being in deep freeze for several weeks, the bungalow market has started to thaw. This may be due to the firmer stockmarket and seeming improvement in the Eurozone crisis of late, suggest agents.
 

'The market is surprisingly getting back its momentum and buyers are making offers for units which are reasonably priced,' says William Wong, managing director of RealStar Premier Group, which specialises in bungalows in Good Class Bungalow Areas (GCBAs) as well as other locations on mainland Singapore.
 

He gives a few examples. The owner of a bungalow in the Oei Tiong Ham Park GCBA on land of about 11,000 sq ft had been asking for about $20 million before the introduction of the additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) on Dec 8 last year but has now lowered the price tag to $19 million. Over in the Ford Avenue GCBA, the asking price for a bungalow on a 20,000 sq ft plot has been trimmed from $40 million previously to $36 million.
 

'The quantum of price adjustment depends on the owner's motivation, but they're more receptive nowadays to granting viewing appointments and more prepared to listen to any offers,' says Mr Wong.
 

No caveats for deals in GCBAs have been lodged so far this year, but RealStar has brokered two such transactions. One is at Lornie Road for $16.5 million or $863.90 per square foot based on land area of about 19,100 sq ft. The two-and-a-half storey freehold property, with a built-up area of about 8,700 sq ft, has seven bedrooms and three smaller rooms. The other, near the Coronation area, has been sold for $13 million. It sits on about 11,000 sq ft land.
 

Word on the street is that a deal was sealed this week in the Chestnut GCBA for about $12 million or $983 psf on land area of about 12,209 sq ft. 
 

Market watchers note that the introduction of the ABSD on Dec 8 does not have such a big direct impact on the GCB market as on mainland Singapore, buyers of landed residential properties must be Singaporeans or at least permanent residents (PRs). The latter need permission from Land Dealings (Approval) Unit before they can buy a landed home and criteria for such approval were tightened last year.
 

Under the ABSD regime, PRs pay 3 per cent ABSD on their second and subsequent residential property while Singaporeans pay the same ABSD rate on their third and subsequent residential property. Foreigners, however, must pay 10 per cent ABSD on any residential property purchased in Singapore. 
 

'So a Singaporean or PR investor who buys a GCB may be liable for 3 per cent ABSD. On a $30 million GCB purchase, the ABSD would be $900,000 - under $1 million,' said Samuel Eyo, director, prestige homes, at Savills (Singapore) who added negotiations for GCBs are usually done in quantums of '$2-3 million or even $5 million'.
 

He attributes the slowdown in GCB activity during December and January more to the year-end holiday season and festivities stretching upto Chinese New Year in January.
 

'But the GCB market was hit by overall negative sentiment following the introduction of the ABSD and buyers made full use of this opportunity to try and negotiate for lower prices,' he added. Post-Chinese New Year, GCB viewings have increased, says Mr Eyo. During the Chinese New Year holidays, agents were busy entertaining potential buyers from China for viewings on Sentosa Cove.
 

CBRE director, luxury homes, Douglas Wong, says: 'Although the ABSD does not have a big direct impact on the GCB market, when taken into consideration with the global economic situation, it has dampened the general sentiments of the market. Buyers have adopted a wait-and-see attitude to monitor the property market. A clearer picture may emerge only in three to six months.'
 

Where the ABSD is having a bigger impact is for bungalows on Sentosa Cove, where 37.5 per cent of the 24 bungalows transacted last year were picked up by non-PR foreigners, notes Mr Eyo. Sentosa Cove is the only place in Singapore where non-PR foreigners may buy landed properties, albeit subject to LDAU approval.
 

Newsman Connections managing director Kris Ho, who brokered $192 million of bungalow sales on Sentosa Cove last year, mostly to overseas buyers, reckons that the 10 per cent ABSD may not affect some foreign buyers who are used to paying even higher taxes on property purchases in their home countries.
 

'I've seen a steady stream of overseas clients from China, Indonesia and Europe for viewings at Sentosa Cove since Chinese Year Year. Owners are so far holding on to their prices,' she added.
 

However, Ms Ho said she does not know of any bungalow deals in the upscale waterfront housing district that were entered into post-ABSD. The last bungalow deals in the area for which caveats were lodged in December are along Cove Drive, at $1,703 psf and $1,782 psf. The highest price achieved for a bungalow in the district last year was $2,610 psf for a property along Ocean Drive on land of about 9,580 sq ft, totalling $25 million, transacted in November.
 

The seller is understood to have incurred a slight loss, taking into account stamp duties and other transaction costs. He had paid nearly $24 million for the property in early January last year. 
 

Elsewhere on mainland Singapore outside GCBAs, interest in landed homes has also started to revive, say agents.
 

Caution in the air
 

Says Credo Real Estate managing director Karamjit Singh: 'Buyers are starting to shop around again for landed properties in greater numbers compared to December and January - when ABSD was introduced and during the festivities. 
 

'Most of these buyers seem to be business people or successful professionals in their late 30s onwards, looking for own occupation. Although the crowds are more, there's still caution in the air.'
 

This week, Credo brokered the sale of a unit at Carmine Collection, a development of six freehold semi-detached houses at the hilltop estate of Eng Kong Road/Lorong Kismis in the Jalan Jurong Kechil/Upper Bukit Timah locale. The unit sold is on land of 2,282 sq ft and comes with a home lift and swimming pool. It fetched $3.72 million.
 

RealStar's Mr Wong too reports greater interest in landed homes in the Sunset vicinity - near Clementi, on the outskirts of Bukit Timah - where there are currently more than 10 bungalows on the market. 'Prices in the Sunset area are lower than in central Bukit Timah, for example, Trevose Crescent, University Road and Kheam Hock Road, which appeals to some buyers. As owners see transactions in the vicinity, they too consider putting their homes up for sale,' said Mr Wong.
 

In such non-GCBA locations too, owners have adjusted their price expectations in the past couple of months. For example, the asking price for a bungalow in the Sunset area on land of 6,400 sq ft has gone down from $9 million pre-ABSD to $8 million, he adds.
 

Word in the market is that a two-and-a-half storey bungalow with six bedrooms in the Sunset location changed hands recently at $8.8 million or $1,381 psf on land of about 6,370 sq ft, while a two-storey link-bungalow in the neighbourhood changed hands for about $5.2 million or close to $1,300 psf on land area.
 

Near Trevose Crescent off Dunearn Road, a three-storey renovated bungalow is understood to have been sold last month for nearly $11 million or $1,830 psf on land area of about 6,000 sq ft.

There is a trend nowadays that people are buying old freehold semi-ds, terraces, etc.  After that they would re-construct it to the maximum permissible floor area, for example, 2 storeys becomes 3 storeys.  You can imagine how much the value will be inflated.  Rich people's game.

I have a unit here and at Smailing Court. Both are in the Kembangan area but Starville is ~900m from the MRT while Smailing Court is ~300m from the MRT. Although Smailing Court is only an apartment with a small swimming pool, rental is very easy and can fetch $3.5K easily for 1216sq ft. For Starville, it is a pain to rent out. By the time some potential tenants walk to Starville, they are dripping in sweat and do not even want to see the unit! Moreover, half the units face PIE (and is very close to PIE) and these units face NW. Even HDBs offer better apartments than this Starville unit. My 2 cents so don't flame me for this.

$1M / 80 years =  $12.5K per year depreciation

Add 10% property tax and maintenance fees and it works out to be 1.5K per month

Rental $4K - $1.5K = $2.5K

Preference shares would have better returns right?

I have not seen any fire sales for ~$1M units. I guess it's due to the high liquidity and low interest rates. 1% interest rate of $1M is only 10K per year, which works out to be $800 per month.

Because SG has v few condos w little lease left. Some of the v old garmen leasehold r selling super cheap w only 10-15yrs lease left, effectively like renting. If all the new leaseholds don't get enbloc, they should be zero value at end of lease. But it's likely at some point en bloc will occur

Private-property prices fall sharply in core area 
 

This suggests that some home buyers became more cautious after the additional buyer's stamp duty took effect in December. 
 

Thu, Feb 09, 2012

my paper 
 

By Reico Wong
 

THE property cooling measures introduced late last year have started to show a significant impact on the housing market.
 

Prices of private apartments and condominiums have dropped by as much as  10.2 per cent   in the Core Central Region since the fourth quarter, suggesting that home buyers became more cautious after the additional buyer's stamp duty took effect in December.
 

The average selling price of such units has fallen to $1,600 per sq ft (psf) from $1,781 psf in the fourth quarter, according to data released yesterday by the Singapore Real Estate Exchange (SRX).
 

The rental prices of apartments and condominiums have also been affected, with those of properties in the non-central areas hit the hardest.
 

The rental rates of units outside the central region have fallen 2.3 per cent since the fourth quarter, from $2.99 psf to $2.92 psf.
 

However, rents for apartments and condominiums in the Core Central Region are still climbing. They have risen 1.3 per cent since the fourth quarter, from $4.68 psf to $4.74 psf.
 

This is likely to be just the start of a downtrend, the heads of property agencies said yesterday at a housing forum organised by SRX. They added, however, that a price crash is unlikely.
 

Private-property prices are expected to drop between 10 and 15 per cent this year, said Dennis Wee Group, HSR Property Group, PropNex, DTZ, ERA Realty and C&H Properties.

Prices of Housing Board resale flats are likely to ease between 3 and 5 per cent this year, but could also fall by as much as 10 per cent if the euro-zone debt crisis worsens, the companies said.
 

Mr Albert Lu, chief executive of C&H, said population growth - especially that of permanent residents and new citizens - is slowing, leading to a fall in housing demand.
 

He added that HDB prices have doubled over the past six years and are unlikely to climb steeply soon, given the large number of Build-To-Order (BTO) flats being pumped into the market.
 

He said the attractive prices of BTOs would draw buyers from the resale market following remarks by National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan that he is looking into letting second- timers buy BTO flats.
 

When second-timers buy BTO flats, they will have to sell their flats, which would further "dampen demand", said Mr Lu.
 

PropNex CEO Mohamed Ismail said buyers now enjoy more choice, with some 5,000 executive-condominium (EC) units slated for construction this year and "a continued supply of government land sales".
 

There will be "supply, supply and more supply, be it of HDB flats, EC units or mass-market properties", he said.
 

"I would not be surprised if public- housing prices remain the same, five years from now," he said, adding that they might be only about 10 per cent higher at most.
 

<< Previous  Next >>  
 
 

Purchases of private property by foreigners reached historic highs last year, hitting 31 per cent, a two-fold increase from 10 years ago, according to another report released yesterday by Savills.
 

Mainland Chinese were the top buyers, making up 28 per cent of all purchases by foreigners, with Indonesians accounting for just 18 per cent of all foreign purchases.
 

Mr Lee Sze Teck, senior manager of research and consultancy at Dennis Wee, said: "Singapore is still one of the best cities in Asia to put your money. If prices drop about 10 per cent and conditions are favourable, buyers will definitely come back."

I believe if we wait long-long, the prices drop like waterfalls. The ancient building design quite different from current design, so buyers usually ended up re-construct if it is landed property. Otherwise, en bloc.

I am waiting for the day when one can walk into a completed project (BTO, EC or private) and buy unsold unit directly from the govt/ developer, like buying car, can see/touch actual product before signing the cheque.   It happened during last crash and should happen again, property almost always under/overshoot, both in prices and suppy due to the long gestation period.

Maybe government settled by paying the owner a good sum of $ for the land acquisition and the owner accept it ?? 

So it's settlement between gov and owner. 
 

I maybe wrong though.
