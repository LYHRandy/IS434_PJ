Many will still buy houses in Malaysia, no matter how much negative stories are reported in the news.
 

This is because in their mind, they keep thinking : "I can't be so unlucky lah, it won't happened to me!"

when comes to flipping property, they don't really care about the safety which they know is a big concern
 

as  you can see JB condo project had become the latest hot selling now ... due to the insecurity of landed bungalow

Bro...a lot of these houses are landed where there are many entrances to the house.
 

In SGP, it is not we don't have such cases. Just that how many landed in SGP compared to Msia? Obviously, the more landed you have, the more cases you have and the more you will hear it.

It's about if the owner has put enough deterrence in place.
 

My parents have a house in JB, Kebun Teh area for the last 40 years, but it has never been broken into. But a few of their neighbors house had been broken in before. And when I look at those houses, it is quite clear to me why the thieves targeted those houses. They never even close all their windows at night !
 

The key is to put enough deterrence by using some common sense, otherwise, you are just inviting any crooks to break into your house. It is the same anywhere, any country. 
 

Thesedays, newer estates are normally guarded by a 24 hour patrol, but again, common sense deterrence methods are needed......doesn't mean having a patrol means can open your doors 24/7 which some owner does, thinking there is a guard, so it must be safe.
 

Problem in JB, IMO, is that there are so many landed around, and they are matched with an equally huge amount of stupid owners who never apply common sense in deterring thieves and robbers.

These thief do their hw and not suka suka go random. I know a Malaysian who got robbed at 7 am when the whole family was getting ready to start their day. He stayed in those new atas estate with security guard and mobile patrol. The thief just ask him to surrender all his valuable and they even know he didnt surrender his 5th rolex. I must say they r good. IMO johor thief is still safer than kl

This one is simple. Just walk to the gantry, push the button and retrieve the ticket (as you are driving in). Then pay at counter, break-into a car you want to steal and drive out the car park with the paid ticket. 
 

If its the Tesco at Bukit Indah, then that car park is free entry, no gantry. I think Tesco in Plentong also free entry.

Best is stay those guarded landed property with high fence. It's deterrence coz if robber can rob easier house, why scale a high fence, risk guards to rob when maybe across the road got property with no high fence and guards?

My parents have a house in JB, Kebun Teh area for the last 40 years, but it has never been broken into. But a few of their neighbors house had been broken in before. And when I look at those houses, it is quite clear to me why the thieves targeted those houses. They never even close all their windows at night !
 

The key is to put enough deterrence by using some common sense, otherwise, you are just inviting any crooks to break into your house. It is the same anywhere, any country. 
 

Thesedays, newer estates are normally guarded by a 24 hour patrol, but again, common sense deterrence methods are needed......doesn't mean having a patrol means can open your doors 24/7 which some owner does, thinking there is a guard, so it must be safe.
 

Problem in JB, IMO, is that there are so many landed around, and they are matched with an equally huge amount of stupid owners who never apply common sense in deterring thieves and robbers.



 
 

Over there crime so low n residents feel so safe as though ty r living in Japan.
 

Here crime very high n we become very kia su so hv to lock everything down. 
 

Kebum Teh area very near city n lots of pple moving around. Less chance of being robbed. Those kenna robbed maybe doing some illegal biz n hv large amounts of cash lying around.

Actually can retire there.  Just don't buy landed house.  Buy condo unit.  It's alot safer.



 
 

But the thrill of many sporeans is to stay landed. Ty know it is impossible in SG but so easy in MY. 
 

But condo is actually better fr older retired couples. Much safer n cheaper to maintain than bunglow.
 

Landed avoid those corner houses. Ty r targeted by thieves more.

In Msia scrap metal is big biz. Thats why u can see many metal gratings on road n those directional signboards missing.

Tonight ty steal left half n next week come back n steal the right half. These petty thefts mostly done by druggies who need some cash fr drugs.

These thief do their hw and not suka suka go random. I know a Malaysian who got robbed at 7 am when the whole family was getting ready to start their day. He stayed in those new atas estate with security guard and mobile patrol. The thief just ask him to surrender all his valuable and they even know he didnt surrender his 5th rolex. I must say they r good. IMO johor thief is still safer than kl

Most shoes have a strip of metal. I think its called a spine. Sometimes its enough to activate the ticket machine.

Hardcore criminals freed
 
 

reminds me of the demolition man sylvester stallone movie  
 


Petaling Jaya - The repeal of the Emergency Ordinance saw some 2,000 detainees being freed. If even a third of them returned to crime, that means there are about 800 hardcore criminals running loose in the country. 

Police, however, believe the number could be far bigger.

Malaysian eateries get armed guards after spate of robberies

Most of the youths released from detention under the EO usually return to their old ways, a police officer said.
 

The assistant superintendent from Perak, who requested anonymity, said that when the EO was in effect, these individuals were kept off the streets.
 

"As soon as they were off the leash, it was back to breaking the law," he said in an interview.
 

This was inevitable as crime is the only livelihood former detainees were accustomed to, he said.
 

"All they need to do is make a telephone call and they will be 'hooked up'. Some need not even make that call; they almost immediately get 'recruited'."
 

Add to this situation the seemingly easy availability of firearms all the way from Bukit Kayu Hitam to Johor, and we have a scary scenario on our hands.
 

With violent snatch thefts, assaults and robberies of restaurant and their patrons, even food outlets are resorting to hiring armed guards to protect them.
 

Others are keeping their doors locked, only allowing regular patrons into their premises.
 

The ASP also said many former detainees were capable of anything, even robbing wedding guests at religious premises.
 

"There have been many such cases when temple weddings were held during the wee hours, an auspicious time for Hindus," he said.
 

"Robbers see this as an 'auspicious' time, too. It is ideal for them - it's 5am, it's dark and there's no real security.
 

"Also, they know that women wear jewellery during these functions," the ASP said.
 

On why the former detainees escaped prosecution, the source said it was difficult to find incriminating evidence against them.
 

"Most of them are gang members. To society, they are ruthless and intimidating. Witnesses are not forthcoming; it is hard to gather concrete proof to put the suspects behind bars."
 

"Many of them are also either on drugs or are pushers themselves," another senior police officer said.
 

He said that while addicts on traditional drugs like ganja and heroin could be sent for rehabilitation programmes, those on amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) like syabu have greater feeling of confidence and were harder to control.
 

There was also no tailored rehabilitation programmes for this group, who only use the drugs when they set out to commit crimes.
 

ATS, he said, was the kind of drugs used by kamikaze pilots in World War Two before their suicide dives. ATS users are also likely to end up with mental health problems.

If/when I move to MY, I prob get a good watchdog n instal a CCTV n alarm system. Costs r not that high n it wil b a good deterrent to breakins.

That's their ideal of 're-cycle' mar ..... 
 

They take down the signboard, melt down and keep the metal. Than their Tenaga will order new signboard, so they take out the metal and make new one for them to use for another 6 months... 
 

Whats good if the re-cycling that lasted for 30 years.....

This is very true... If there are Metal gates in addtion to a main good timber door, and metal gate uses good Abloy padlock, and got iron grilles at every window... The thieves will move on to the next easier target.. these kind of defence will make house ugly, that's why some owners never install, but it's look vs security.

The basic question is : why do you want to live your days in a place that MUST have a high fence and well guarded ?  



 

Singapore also the same mah, but our fence is around the whole island instead.. It's just that for Malaysia, the guards are more visible, so are the high fences.. And their fences are merely physical.. Ours.. Somewhat different la.. I don't mind living in a guarded landed area.. It's always about the illusion of freedom / security.. As long as a person is not too bothered by it, I don't think it is an issue.. Just my 2 cents.. 
 




My msian fren lagi good.
 

He rent out house to a decent couple. After some time he go n spot check he find many pple living in the house.
 

After some time ty delay pay rental then totally stopped. He then ask them to move out by a certain date.
 

B4 that date ty moved out but not b4 cleaning out the whole house of everything incl the light bulbs n sinks n taps even.
 

He went to the house n found it totally bare except fr the stone walls. Even his metal gate was gone. 



 

Woah, this is bad.. How come from decent couple to many people living in the house?

actually my china colleague have moved over to stay in JB, they too mentioned about the similarity between SZ/HK and JB/SG.

now they rent out their condo and stay in JB... best of both world.
 

Believe once we reached 6mil population, SG will be too crowded for a decent living...

On a weekend, traffic jam before u reach the shopping mall, scouting for a carpark lot in shopping mall, finding a table for food, queue for food......
 

believe some will spill over to JB.... not becoz of price but becoz of the available space....

now they rent out their condo and stay in JB... best of both world.
 

Believe once we reached 6mil population, SG will be too crowded for a decent living...

On a weekend, traffic jam before u reach the shopping mall, scouting for a carpark lot in shopping mall, finding a table for food, queue for food......
 

believe some will spill over to JB.... not becoz of price but becoz of the available space....
 

Am i wrong?? Any comments??

you are not wrong. it's a fact and it's coming ... everyone can see it
 

shenzhen <> hongkong
 

spore <> JB
 

symbiotic relationship



 

y nobody mention difference between china n boleh is that china has a huge hinterland domestic economy, whereas boleh has hardly any economic activity except export n KL biz?
 

wats driving shenzhen is big manufacturing base, will boleh become another big manufacturing monster? Is there alot of urbanization in boleh? Are there many orang asli buying condos? R there many jobs being created 2 create a boom? If can answer all positive, then maybe can compare JB n shenzhen, otherwise to me alot of it is the temasick investment hype, surplus cash from SG n boleh citizens getting 90% mortgage(highly inflationary). Different drivers which may yield same results? hmm...

Singapore also the same mah, but our fence is around the whole island instead.. It's just that for Malaysia, the guards are more visible, so are the high fences.. And their fences are merely physical.. Ours.. Somewhat different la.. I don't mind living in a guarded landed area.. It's always about the illusion of freedom / security.. As long as a person is not too bothered by it, I don't think it is an issue.. Just my 2 cents.. 
 
 
 

Woah, this is bad.. How come from decent couple to many people living in the house?



 
 

Thats why looks can b deceiving. The couple "looked" decent but end up ty were not. Hahaha.

Anyone will consider buying a 3 stry cluster house in HH for RM2.XX mil?

i reckon this price is way too high for a house in JB...
 

Anyone have the same experience on the above pricing?



 
 

All these overpriced houses r aimed at Sporeans. Msians wun buy them.

agreed these are over priced housing in JB...

but if u look at it... foreigners are only allow to purchase house that are RM500K and above, so even if we bought at RM 500K the locals will also too find it too expensive.
 

They locals have their houses built for them and price at their affordability level... which i must agreed Msia govt have done well if u take a look at our situation...

Why did we buy up the properties in JB?? becoz we are not protected in our homeland so we have to seek up north....
 

coming back to the thread... what can we get at S$ 1million???

There are people who buy up JB houses due to cheaper prices that afford much larger space. It does not make sense for any sgprean to ''seek up north'' where we are not the protected according to your theory ley. Anyway, heard that iskandar project is so big that it would be very tough to sell the unit in future, As prospective buyers and easily buy a brand new unit in the same neighbourhood as developers built new projects

well it really depends on what are your objectives, plans and risks...

committing into any large items does involved certain risks but most importantly we need to prepare a worst case scenarios...
 

given the exchange rate and low cost living, i would think it is a good retirement option with a house that is paid up in JB and with rental earning in SG when i retired

if exchange rate is not to our favour due to Msia economy have grew, then we can work the other way round... like hedging and weighing which side reap the most benefit....
 

i am not buying to sell at a profit for short term, i am thinking more on hedging and plan for retirement. Even if the house is too big for me to stay, i can rent it out and look for a smaller apartment.. i.e. somewhere half way to Genting weather can be real nice for older folks....

JB is rich only cos ty r so close to us. Otherwise Johor has very little to offer in economic terms.

I was toking to the mechanic. A 20 year old. He say ALL Sporeans r damm rich. I tell him not so. Only our Gharmen is damm rich. Many sporeans r just average only. He still dun believe. Keep saying no lah. He see all sporeans damm rich. Hahaha.

Many Singaporeans are rich only in asset, but not in cash. Many lived by being financed by loans.
 

If the government is rich, the people will be rich also, only if there is fair distribution of wealth among all citizens.

But still SG is a damm expensive place to live plus u cannot move to the suburbs to cut costs. Our country so small the prices about same all over. 
 

One option is to do as much shopping in JB like what I do. Can save quite a lot like that.

u need to know one thing is that when gahman mentioned 6.9 mil population in SG, they have factor in JB as a contingency which we will move to...

do u think our small island can hold 6.9mil?
 

take a walk outside in town area today and ask if we have touched 5.5mil..

how abt adding one more million to current crowd?
 

First they ask we move our ageing parents to JB nursing home for cheaper alternative.

next they will ask those who cannot afford SG housing to move JB for cheaper option so that the rich fr outside can stay in SG and move their $$millions into their pockets
 

these are the signals and i hope i am very wrong on this....

we have to thank sg government for the strong SGD vs MYR. Else we are no different compare to general Malaysian. Btw still quite a number of my malaysian friends r self-employed and earn more than what i get after convert back to ringgit. To be frank in recent years i've seen quite a number of sport cars on the road compare to previously only occupied with proton. Even a small town like kulai u can see bentley, Audi R8, Ferrari. the car u commonly see on the road r alphard, vellfire, BMW and merc. They r getting richer now..

which country dont raise taxes? 
 

and i am not faulting them on this new ruling...

reason is becoz they raise tax ONLY on foreign owners and protect their locals
 

there is a place for foreigners to stay and there is also demarcation for locals to stay at cheap housing MEANT for locals 

Petrol is a good example...
 

Why should Msia govt provide us low price and low taxes when our own govt is raising prices so many taxes on us?

take a look at our own backyard... and tell me in which way we are protected?
 

by moving to another place to stay or retire, we need to embrace their culture and way of handling things...

staying there does not mean u have to show

- your armani suits 

- Rolex

- conti cars

- fat wallet with multiple cards inside

- talk loud like a sg towkay
 

be like the rest and i believe u will pass off just like another normal local...

u need to know one thing is that when gahman mentioned 6.9 mil population in SG, they have factor in JB as a contingency which we will move to...

do u think our small island can hold 6.9mil?
 

take a walk outside in town area today and ask if we have touched 5.5mil..

how abt adding one more million to current crowd?
 

First they ask we move our ageing parents to JB nursing home for cheaper alternative.

next they will ask those who cannot afford SG housing to move JB for cheaper option so that the rich fr outside can stay in SG and move their $$millions into their pockets
 

these are the signals and i hope i am very wrong on this....




Bro, don't be so negative and worry that SG can't hold 6.9mil lah....the govt have catered plans to accommodate the larger population, so I believe it can be done.
 

Even if govt never say move to old age homes in JB, people will also move there anyway, when the cost here increase too much.  
 

SG housing the stuff will still be affordable, so long as you live within your means.

When sgp is burst to the brim, maybe HDB can consider leasing land from Johor sultan to build public housing for singaporeans, set aside 10% of the units for bumis?   win/win?      G to G negotiations lah....

Actually, if i am happy after checking around the security aspects of the neighorhood, and if the owner is willing to lease it out to me at a price i can afford, i can rent it and sublet to friends in sgp as weekend getaway....  price and security come first.  These houses sit on easily 10,000sq land each, individual designs....  spacious siah!!!  (not for permanent stay, but just to get away from crowded sgp once in awhile if i can organise amongst frens/relatives)

Johor is not that bad.... good for sgp to expend our industrial activities, more condos... grow own agricultural supplies....   provided we have at least a equal say how to run the place.   Its a merger, not one joining the other.      We alone lack land mass and space. Johor has both.

The houses look at least 6-8 years old, well maintained looking from outside. Not the low cost type.  Could well be their equivalent of district 9....

........... SG housing the stuff will still be affordable, so long as you live within your means.  




This is the key.   Or start small. Nowadays lots of young couples/families want to start with 3room flats etc even to the extent of over stretching themselves finacially.  If they start small, and move to bigger flats only when the size of the family grows later, there is less to be anxious or stressful about in terms of housing loan obligations etc.

Ty wil say anything if ty think it wil benefit them. Ty were planning to bring in many FT's so ty say its OK, we can handle it. Ty just trying to convince us to accept it quietly. 
 

Now the FT's hv been put on the shelf cos of the unhappiness we expressed b4 the last election, ty say the  6.9 mil figure is just an estimation but it might not b that high.
 

Ty wil change their words as n when it suits them lah.

Wow.. more than a million RM.. no joke.. for a place that used to be worthless.. now price literally shoot up..



 
 

I think its just the Msian developers trying to take advantage of us. Ty see how much we can pay fr a HDB flat so ty think we can surely pay millions fr a nice landed.
 

U see those high end properties ty built fr us, after some time if we dun bite, ty sure sell cheap cheap like lelong in pasar malam.
 

Thats why I dun rush in now. Later sure hv many bargains just waiting fr buyers.
 

All those who bought high wil b    all the way.

Ya we earn more but everything here also damm much more ex then there.
 

He tell me he hear Sporeans all own many cars like BMW, Merc etc. 
 

I tell him dun believe what those pple say. Many pple take bus, MRT. Not everybody rich. Some just getting by cos our country everything very expensive. We earn more than them but we also need to pay much more than them fr the same stuff ty get at bargain basement prices.
 

So the coin has 2 sides. We see them poor n everything cheap. Ty see us as rich n everything expensive.

Yes these r the type of houses I am considering.
 

Not those fancy "Gated n Guarded" cluster houses built fr rich Sporeans.
 

I stay where the locals stay. Food, daily necessities etc all much cheaper. 
 

I go eat those out of the way coffeeshops the food so damm cheap compared to those places that cater to Sporeans.

Actually, a lot of houses in those "garden" estates cost less than RM100K niah. Big, nice and spacious. Good for own living, but rent bo lui one.  
 

If you ever need to temporarily re-locate to another state/country, got to beg someone you trust to live in and probably pay him/her $$$ to upkeep instead of him/her paying you rent. LOL... Otherwise, you come back and see some strange people taken over your place.

Unfortunately we can only rent, coz they dont look like costing above rm500k, unless we buy the whole village and call it KFC, KumpongF'kingComplex   .... oh no, correction, should be KumpongFUNcommunity  



 
 

U buy n develop lah. I sarpok u. 
 

Can turn it into a chicken farm fr all sporeans going there fr RnR.
 

U can give special discount fr members of MCF. I can help u run the place if u really interested.
 

I b the QC tester. All new gers come I b the 1st to check if ty r good enough or not.
 

Then after u run fr several tears n recover yr investment n made some good profits, we develop some nice bungalows fr us to stay during our retirement days.
 

 Relax n drink n tok kok every morning noon n night.
 

That wud b a nice way to retire there unlike here in SG where we r expected to work till we die.

Come to think of it, investing in KumpongFunClub may not guarentee constant business, better invest in either Maternity or Burial businesses.... no one can escape these two "gates"      We enchance the 2nd type of business by providing dirty old men with a special package that in their last days they will be surrounded by xmms (pre-goodbye service),  on the actual day, xmms will hold his hand to say the last farewell...     question: would we have enough customers?

Better cover your exhaust pipe in case they get hot and poke it.....  
 

Or check your wipers are working or not,  matas can shoot some sticky stuff on your windscreen.... When discharging (their duties, etc) they usually have all corners covered....  How to drive home later if your windscreen is fully covered!?

In case you do take mrt, the section in between two train cars seems to have stronger aircon, good place to stand as it's less smelly there even when it's crowded      Psssss.... When was the last time you took mrt?

Its not like there's work place in Paris ris, should create a micro business park in punggol before the flat TOP so the pple can go directly to work there rather than flooding the train system at its terminal

Buy more shares in train company.... Can't beat them, join them  
 

I met someone in the new SMRT team trying to fix the problems left behind by Ferrari-driving, Hunks-Carried-Throne-Riding, colored-hair chabor, asked him why not increase the number of carriages per tain to ease the overcrowding as train systems are supposed have built-in flexibility from day one, and not be a closed system?   He pulled me on side and answered in a soft voice:-  LTA designed n built it before handing over to SMRT......  no point opening the can of worms in terms of exposing past errors/oversights..... Let's move on, doesn't matter it's taxpayers money,  ok!?     I said, YES, SIR, I agree

No lah. I hold the strap n lock my knees n sleep standing up. 

Sometimes my knees wud buckle n lucky I am fast enough to grab tight to the strap otherwise I wud fall flat on the floor. 




Actually passengers next to you in the crowded train will naturally prop you up, you won't have a chance to fall, don't worry too much

Now buy the shares no use. Sud hv bought when ty first came out. Anyway I sold most of my shares. Quite a few at a loss.    Now I not interested in playing shares anymore.
 

Even my unit-trust funds I just holding cos I dun need to monitor. But still the profits not very attractive. 
 
 

Now I use my money to go fishing or holiday better. More worth. 
 
 

That person very smart thats why he work in SMRT. He wan to work there fr long time.
 

He bring up LTA mistakes he soon join the unemployed looking fr a job.

JOHOR BARU - Police arrested four men, including a Singaporean, suspected of being involved in robberies at two locations here last Wednesday.
 

In the first incident, police received a report at 2.30am of a robbery in Taman Setia Tropika where two men, armed with parang, broke into a house and held the victim, a Singaporean, at knifepoint.
 

Johor police chief Datuk Mohd Mokhtar Shariff said the suspects fled with the victim's BMW, RM500 (S$195), a handphone, an ATM card and two passports.
 

At 6.45am, police received another report in Taman Pelangi of a Singaporean who was robbed by two men, who fled with the victim's car, a laptop, RM3,000, an ATM card, an identity card and a passport.
 

Following the two cases, police carried out raids in Bandar Dato' Onn, Larkin and Taman Setia Tropika where the four men, aged between 23 and 53, were arrested.
 

Police also seized three cars reported missing, four handphones, six identity cards belonging to the victims, documents belonging to the victims in Taman Setia Tropika and two credit cards.
 

"The suspects have been remanded to assist in investigations. We are also investigating whether they are targeting Singaporeans in Johor Baru," said Mokhtar.

 

which shows, when Malaysian police wants to solve a case, they can and they have ways to do it.

But if they don't want to, you move mountains also no use....

sometimes for us deprived sinkies, its irresistable when u realise how relatively cheap a used 5-series cost there....  
 

but you're right. I know old folks in really ulu villages who are worth millions (i helped with their estate planning)... 

You'd never, ever expect it from the way they live and spend... doubt even their wives know

Work hawker must stay till late then go home bathe n change by the time already too late n all the chio bu already taken by the early birds.
 

Summore put the most expensive cologne also no use cos the body n hair still hv the smell of all the oil n spices from the kitchen.

High end houses in Msia no hurry. 
 

There wil still b many more left after the craze wears off. Then u can slowly pick n choose n bargian the best price. 
 

Most Msians wont touch these houses.
 

Msia land is unlimited unlike here. There u can buy freehold n still damm cheap.
 

Here even HDB flats the land in cheepo places like CCK, Bt Batok, Marsling etc all the land is priced at the same price of land in Raffles Place n Shenton Way. Thats why HDB flats keep getting more n more expensive.

U can start n b the pioneer to sell "healthy" food at hawker centres. But I already see foods like pasts etc which is unlike our common hawker fare.
 

Dunno if ty can florish but I see more n more pple selling ang mo food in hawker ctrs. Maybe still can make money cos rental is cheaper than restaurant.
 

But most important is yr food must taste good. If taste like sheet, u cannot survive for sure. 
 

Imagine I walk into the hawker cntr n planning to eat salad then kenna the smell of char kuay teow, hokkien mee, prata, mee siam, satay etc. Sure I wil forget about the salad.

This is true.
 

Before I embarked on tertiary education here, my parents insisted that I go and work part time and it was an eye opener. School of hard knocks is still very relevant and applicable today.

+ 1, we bought the SD for retirement and extended family gathering, not merely it is cheap, but reasonable, we were waiting for the past 2 years before we make our move in Malaysia, doing market research & bank loan.plus others issues and concern like safety and security & daily commute.
 

For Singaporean buying into JB or KL properties, there are many options to consider, we are not rich, merely average income earners who cannot afford the luxury of landed pty here, we have considered very carefully the pros and cons of owning a landed pty , so when a Sp agent proposed one to us, we went along with an invite to a Hotel launch, checking out the developer's track record and due diligence done. we are not fully convinced but we are extremely happy that the developer has a proven track records, transparent and down to details, upfront and forth-coming, we asked for many

unspoken rules, they obliged and get the FAQ done speedily
 

As compared to developer's fisrt phase launch, we realised that indeed prices has gone up by 20% in less than a year ago, so we went with cautions and care, my family and i checked every 4 corners  and spoken to may residents and neighbours, many were Singaporean and malaysian alikes, plus some PR tenants.
 

Most importantly, we like the serenity of the and the close proximity to causeway, less than 15 mins.
 

we are buying for self stay and not for investment.

but you're right. I know old folks in really ulu villages who are worth millions (i helped with their estate planning)... 

You'd never, ever expect it from the way they live and spend... doubt even their wives know  




Yes, that is correct. Many of them are land owners, mainly engage in palm oil plantation. Their days are carefree, only go plantation in the morning to look-see look-see, then afternoon go town's kopitiam to drink and chit-chat. And they drive normal Japanese or Malaysian made cars.

But not many youngsters wan to b hawkers.
 

No style. No class. No atas. No tie etc.
 

Work AC office with long sleeves n tie more stylish. Easier to attract gers  . Can go straight from work to party in Orchard road. Plus can put nice cologne n smell nice.
 

Work hawker must stay till late then go home bathe n change by the time already too late n all the chio bu already taken by the early birds.
 

Summore put the most expensive cologne also no use cos the body n hair still hv the smell of all the oil n spices from the kitchen. 




Not true lah. Nowadays gers   see what the guy have, or drive to decide if wanna hook onto the guy! 
 

A office guy can come with nice shirt & tie, but take MRT to Orchard Road. A hawker can drive a car to Orchard Road also, in normal shirt and pants. Who would the ger follow leh?

Ty see it as a dirty smelly work n feel embarresed telling frens their BF is a hawker.
 

Most like to say their BF is sales manager or similar. More impressive to boast to their frens.

OK lah, its a seafood place, many restaurants by the sea, most overlooking Singapore's Sembawang area, good place for couples...
 

See this report on Johor Kaki : http://johorkaki.blogspot.sg/search/label/...p;by-date=false
 

Anyway, while I was looking for Senibong seafood, I also found this place not far from Senibong, called Telok Todak (in Masai) : http://johorkaki.blogspot.sg/search/label/...?max-results=20

If yrs is overlooking Sembawang then its around Stulang Laut.
 

Yr above post say the restaurant in Gelang Patah is near Masai???? They r actually very far apart.

No lah. On the first link, you need to scroll down to the bottom, then you see the restaurants of Senibong. The link contains reviews of many seafood restaurants in JB, the first few are in Geylang Patah, only the last one is in Senibong.

Why engraved ID69?    Coz cameras come from your share of investment in the JV, it's wrong for me not to engrave it....

unless you bao the solar film both sides continuously, it will break no matter what. I think, the bat in this case is too light, too thin; bo kao lat type. I saw people in Segamat smash one Toyota SUV, big big heavy baton, smash until all windows chui chui, but the glass still intact w/o dropping off. He should do a fast reverse and pin the robber against the gate.

Looks like they are outside of the compound. If that's so, the guard is technically correct not to interfere (what I mean is to try to physically restrain the bugger; he may call polis though). That's why I think, he was trying to ensure they don't cross inside the boundary.

GEORGE TOWN: Contractors, some with links to triads, are forcing buyers of high-rise property here to carry out renovation works.
 

Many of them charge a premium, sometimes up to 20% more than normal contractors.
 

If the buyers insist on hiring contractors from outside, they are compelled into buying materials such as sand, bricks, cement and steel cages.
 

Alternatively, the buyers can pay a "settlement" to bring in outside contractors.
 

Most buyers dare not lodge complaints with the police for fear of retaliation from triad members.
 

With developers turning a blind eye to the issue, the so-called "in-house" contractors have become more brazen in intimidating buyers.
 

Although such practices could be traced back to the 1990s, the mushrooming of condominium projects in Penang has made matters worse.

Singaporeans play it safe amid spate of crime in Malaysia
 

A recent spate of violent crimes in Malaysia has not put Singaporeans off going there. However, many are playing it safe, The Straits Times has found.
 

At least 24 people have been killed and 21 injured since April in shootings and robberies in areas including Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Perak, Johor and Negeri Sembilan.
 

Miss Candice Lim, a management trainee based in Kuala Lumpur, never leaves her house without a pepper spray.
 

She also uses the MyTeksi application on her phone to book taxis, which allows her friends and family to track her ride.

sometimes, people need to be educated of what "power" a private security guard has and what they cannot do.



 
 

True the guard has the same power of any ordinary person but.................when someone is in danger anyone has the power to help that person.
 

I know the guard was outnumbered but he cud at least try to shout n raise the alarm which might frighten the robbers away. But if he did that he wud probably have to look for another place to work cos the robbers might come back another day to take revenge on him. 
 

I think the guard wanted to keep his job at the condo so decided to just mind his own biz.

maybe the syndicates should become developers and sell their condos with the slogan "We are the robbers who WILL NOT disturb our own customers, GUARANTEED & CHOPPED"..........   
 

It takes a tiger to protect its own turf



 
 

Ya or do like what was done in SG b4.
 

The developers pay the gangsters protection money so ty dun disturb the condo residents.
 

Then ty sell the safety by saying, "This condo is protected by gang 246. The most powerful n feared gang in Msia. U r safe staying here".

I have friends always asking about investing in Iskandar Malaysia and these are my thoughts. If I am heading an SME (small and medium enterprise) in Singapore, it would make good business sense for me to expand into Iskandar, especially if I am looking for cheaper labour and space to grow my factory, for instance. On paper, Iskandar seems to have all the infrastructure in place to support SMEs.
 
 

But I am not sure if I would want to relocate my family there. During my younger days, I spent nine years living and studying in Johor Bahru. In those days, most of us locals knew the unwritten rules for survival like avoiding encounters with members of the royal family. For example, if we were to see a car bearing special number plates on the road, we would not think of overtaking it, no matter how slow it was going. I don

true i find Iskandar too big and too ambitious, hard to realize and achieve within such a short time given the capabilities of Johor. Maybe by 2020 only half of the plan will be realised or less. but still some so called world class infrastructure will boost Johor economy by times but not to expected target of Iskandar Malaysia.

Those who bought it 10 years ago can see the profit but those bought recently at super high price can forget earning a profit. Even in next 5-10 years dont think property price will hit higher then the current price.

Happens with many places especially those condos last time.
 

At first very nice n pple buy till ty keep changing MCST cos of corruption till all detiorate. Lifts all not working. Lights not working. Water not working. Everything spoil never got fixed cos MCST no more money cos all kenna makan by corrupt pple in charge.
 

I prefer to buy my own house n maintain it myself. 
 

Plus in Msia land is in excess unlike here. Property prices very hard to increase. Most wil drop even.

But now due to big plan iskandar, many people interested to invest, developer set price high high. So in another 10 years price will remain about the same. Unlike sg in future still can rise. See in google map, sg land so limited but johor so big, 3-4x of sg. 
 

If invest better in klcc

Also the quality n standard of the upkeep of the whole place wil drop till become like rubbish dump then ty die. 
 

Happens with many places especially those condos last time.
 

At first very nice n pple buy till ty keep changing MCST cos of corruption till all detiorate. Lifts all not working. Lights not working. Water not working. Everything spoil never got fixed cos MCST no more money cos all kenna makan by corrupt pple in charge.
 

I prefer to buy my own house n maintain it myself. 
 

Plus in Msia land is in excess unlike here. Property prices very hard to increase. Most wil drop even.

no la indon not so serious unless in rural areas.  in city law very strict, very different from indo 10 years ago. now everything computerized, even law getting tighter just like in SG. think for foreigners better to invest in aussie or other countries. Batam or Bali isnt a good choice for foreigners

Msia must b careful.
 

Many cases house build halfway developer collect money then declare bankrupt n the house left standing there built half way.
 

If u got enough money, u hv to get yr own contractor n architech to complete the house otherwise cannot saty n cannot sell.
 

Thats why u can see many houses in Msia built half way n left there with garden all growing lallang.
 

Sometimes house no sewerage, water n electricty even. Those worse still. Very hard to settle.

yes some countries no law to protect buyers, like for example if developer late in completion of TOP will get fined. but in some countries has no such practices. 
 

thats why must find reliable contractors like Setia. or else dont buy. Just like in Indo. 
 

If u choose any Tom D1ck Harry developer, even ur condo finish TOP, after few years lift broke down, no light, foul smell, leaking roof, etc, very ill maintained.
 

Some condos in JB now like that, those like more than 10 years or some less than that

But burgulars n leaky roof is a small price to pay fr the chance to live in a nice landed property there.

My advise to bro here... rent out your HDB here and go rent in Bukit Indah in Iskandar for 2 year trial period. If you like it, then buy lo. That way u can maximise you Spore home and reduce the risk of buying something in Iskandar that you may not like. Need to be very selective in Iskandar. 
 
Don't go for cheap one. Go for high end one like ASTAKA or special economic location like MEDINI

If you stop work at 5.30pm weekday , think by the time you reach home would be 7-8pm.
And that is a if you stop work at 5.30pm!

Even if I wanna retire there, I would rather rent an unit and move around say once every year than to sink my money into a permanent property. My reasons:
 
1. rental is not expensive in JB (yet)
2. flexibility and able to try out new areas
3. rent new apartment/landed unit without need of future maintenance 
4. strange and ad hoc regulation changes, sometimes overnight without notice, and in the past, retroactively

rent = direct expenses
buy = live and sell with profit
 
if need to down $300k for buying a property and if putting FD with interest plus abit top up can cover rent ... then it is a good option. 
 
because rent is low but not for terrace or bungalow and abundance of units 
 
buy is the best option when there is resale value and scarce because rental will only go up.

buy is the best option when there is resale value and scarce because rental will only go up.

 
Perhaps one can look at it this way:
 
- Property appreciation in Malaysia is not really that fantastic. Hence, hoping for capital gain is a little stretched. 
 
- unless one pays with cash, the interest rates for mortgage in Malaysia are not that attractive. Even with cash, as you have pointed out, one has to forgo opportunity cost (as in FD interest, potential returns thru other instruments, etc)
 
- there are indeed an abundance of properties in Malaysia, incl upcoming Iskandar. Whether there is a glut, I leave it o the experts, though I do see an oversupply at this rate of development.
 
- Less than favorable exchange rates for MR and S$ over the years.
 
Of course rental payment will be an expense, but I assume the person will have at least a house in SGP to rent out. If one has to sell his SGP house just o buy a JB house, I suggest he take-stock of his finances.
 
End of the day, it depends on individual's considerations. For me, I am for sure not buying.

Yes, precisely the market in Malaysia is not as liquid as we want. Why should one buy a resale unit (apt or house) when there are abundance of new developments in the market? Not unless the price is very very attractive. The notion of capital gain hence is doubtful.

True when renting a house, we also can look for new house slowly and understanding the area better

Still, cranes and dump trucks are busy at Danga Bay. Near Country Garden, Chinese and domestic developers are clearing land in preparation for still more construction. Many believe the property slowdown is temporary; they point to the growing economy and generational shift toward modern, urban lifestyles. Such people "are investing in the future of Malaysia and Singapore," said Country Garden's Hum.

Still, cranes and dump trucks are busy at Danga Bay. Near Country Garden, Chinese and domestic developers are clearing land in preparation for still more construction. Many believe the property slowdown is temporary; they point to the growing economy and generational shift toward modern, urban lifestyles. Such people "are investing in the future of Malaysia and Singapore," said Country Garden's Hum.
 
Future of Singapore ?

The political situation in Malaysia is always changing and there is no transparent resale market! Especially in Iskandar - from what I heard, all the developers are raising prices in tandem to give previous buyers the impression of paper gains in value but when they try to sell there;s no buyer!

All depends how the Iskandar project goes.... many are expecting expats to flop in like the great migration..... 
 
I dont think that will happen that fast. and very high risk of changes politically

When my time has come for me to retire, I will (not may) still not buy Bolehland property although I will stay overseas for extended periods of 1 to 2 mths a time twice a year.
 
Various destination in Malaysia are in the equation, but certainly not a permanent place. That is to say, I WILL NEVER BUY another property anywhere overseas, Malaysia included.
 
I rather pay rents for my stay and have the flexibility to choose anywhere I want. - Iskandar also can, Melaka also jadi, KL pun a-sai.
Why should I sink my hard-earned cash and worry about all the associated problems including maintenance and political gymnastic.
 
I will use my Spore home as my comfort nest after each extended travel.

Developing in Malaysia is a challenge in itself.

Is it too early to say not to buy pty in Malaysia, Thailand or Philippines ?
 
Certainly sounds pessimistic, the general equation is that builder built for supply and demand, not withstanding foreigner's needs and wants.
 
What and why we cannot afford here is TDSR, we may consider buying one in Bolahland, and the recent upheaval has certainly bite us in terms of VEP fee, Traffic snarl and some undesirable hiccups that irks us. And the truth hurts more than anything else, R&F advertisement has come to a standstill, Danga Bay project has less crowds, construction works may be on-going and nobody dare say anything more.
 
Would you buy Mal pty now even prices dive south ? Certainly, we yearn for landed pty and with such uncertainty, i would put on hold, yes, I may consider to rent condo to stay & feel the current market sentiment for half a year or so them decide the future of landed pty purchase in JB, KL or Penang. Maybe buying commercial in JB would be a better bet ( with tenancy ).

This vantage bay is pretty ideal as cheaper alternative for singaporean retirees; the singapore branded hostipal should be an extremely strong selling point for this project. But one has to be comfortable with the currency risk in the next 10 to 30 years, which is pretty substantial imo.

Why alway think about buying? Long term lease is the same. With so many house availble, you can rent a good house at a very cheap price and don't have to worry about house price up or down. JB is built for the mainland chinese, so will be ghost town in future.

JB only for own stay so buying for investment is out for most.  Without tenants and investment monies to support, price cannot be sustained.  You are right, better buy in KL or Penang (the latter because it is like Singapore, an island).

Btw news from Jb, suka suka change policy
Rowsley's Johor project gets special exemptions from govt
 
PUBLISHED ON FEB 19, 2015 1:09 AM
 
Published on Feb 19, 2015 1:09 AM
 
DEVELOPER Rowsley has received special exemptions for its residential project bSkies in Vantage Bay, in Johor, such as a lower minimum purchase price and higher foreign buyer quota.
 
The 75-storey Skies has been exempted from the usual RM1 million (S$379,160) minimum price applying to property purchases by foreigners.
 
The project will be subject to a RM500,000 minimum purchase price instead.
 
Its foreign buyer quota has been dramatically lifted from the usual 30 per cent to 92 per cent.
 
Chief executive Lock Wai Han told The Straits Times yesterday: "The RM1 million waiver is something that's quite special, not many projects have got it."
 
Skies is part of the $2.2 billion Vantage Bay integrated project being built by Rowsley. The site is owned by a 70-30 joint venture between tycoon Peter Lim and the Johor royal family.
 
Vantage Bay will also feature a health hub, which includes a tertiary care hospital by TMC LifeSciences, a Malaysia-listed firm Mr Lim controls.
 
Mr Lock said in a phone interview: "Due to the integrated and lifestyle nature of this whole development, the government has recognised it as one of four catalytic nodes, on a par with Medini, so we've been given some special privileges."
 
The Straits Times earlier reported that Medini in Nusajaya is exempt from the tighter rules.
 
Mr Lock said there is no estimated date for Skies' launch as the market now is soft and Rowsley will wait for it to pick up before deciding on a launch date.
 
Skies is still in the process of getting the advertising permit and developer's licence it needs to sell the apartments.
 
The developer also announced that it will develop and manage a US$550 million (S$746.5 million) mixed-used development in Yangon, Myanmar, with Vietnam's Hoang Anh Gia Lai Joint Stock Company.
 
The project features four office blocks, a five-star hotel, a retail mall and more than 1,000 serviced and residential apartments.
 
Earlier this week, Rowsley reported that for the 12 months ended Dec 31, net profit was $49.4 million compared with a net loss of $226.3 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 288 per cent to $87.2 million. It added that this is its "first full-year performance as a transformed integrated real estate group".
 
Full-year earnings per share was 1.162 cents up from loss per share of 10.52 cents a year earlier, while net asset value as at Dec 31 was 11.78 cents, up from 10.87 cents a year earlier.

Yes, even Malacca units also being advertised here, must be too expensive for the middle income group there, try to woo more Singaporeans due to the exchange rates, unless one paying cash to purchase the property there, the bank loan interest rates seemed to be quite high.

When its no longer owned by Peter Lim and the Johor royal family
 
the 1/2 million RM and 92% rule can very quickly change back
 
to 1 million RM and 30%.

Malacca has sudden construction boom, suddenly many new apartment projects launched, its insane cos malacca has not much market for highrise residential, would rather invest in jbcc

I would like to hear from those who bought property in JB to share their reasons for doing so. I am trying to find just one reason to put some money in there. But so far, I can't convince myself.
 
At 1 stage, my partner and I nearly bought a decent size factory space there thinking of shifting some operations in there to solve the manpower and rising biz cost issues. But after doing some home work and leg work, we were no convince that the move is going to solve our issues at all.

  Muz get places whereby the local malaysian will stay,dont end up the whole development empty aft TOP,or owner desperate and rent out to workers,short term stay etc.
  There are still some old project whereby you can buy rm 500 k (if divided by 2.6) is about 192k Sing dollar,after which only can buy at 1million.Landed (GG) seems a better Choice?However there's a debate on this between landed or condo.
  Neost buy only,if you cant buy anymore in SG,buy only when you are prepare that there's no rental no appreciation,jam at custom or pay VEP at custom.Then it should be fine.(ps,you are paying cash,for your installments).

mai spread fears... My prc colleague has invested one in country garden.. Just couple of days ago he was still so happy saying sg dollar so strong vs ringgit..he already counting his paper gain.. hehe...He convert Sing to Ringgit to buy cheap.But Ringgit become cheaper so his property value in terms of SGD is worse.
Perhaps he take loan big big loh. Then he mitigate that risk.
But isnt there a limit to the loan for foreigners?
 
Since he PRC, maybe he is happy now becos CNH is strong.
However, whats also most important in making such investments is that you want the value of the underlying to rise ultimately.  
 
I dont know, i never thought of buying anything in a place full of land where newer better cheaper comes up every other month.  Just the perfect formula for loss.  I am happy when people buy though....
 
Muayhahahahaha
 
 
These are screen shots from news on TV. 
Fear not spread by me.

IMHO, property prices only go up if land is scarce... hence there is demand over supply.
If land is readily, meaning supply is everywhere, why would prices go up then?

housing was never part of its main draft

“You have to be fair to Iskandar as housing was never part of its main draft. The crux of its investment was more on services, hospitality and manufacturing as well as allocations for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). 
“The investments we are interested in are not housing and this is why we have called in Pinewood and Legoland to Iskandar. That is the main investment strategy but because of all these, foreign developers think there is a demand for their properties and that is not happening.

Its definitely oversupply
 
 
Rule of thumb, do not invest in a condo that surrounding has many empty lands. 
 
Even in future the area will prosper, ur property wont rise much cos by that time more developers building condos. The growth of condos will always faster than the population, economic and expat growth

Buy MY property, can. But cannot have the SG mindset that you will make money from selling or renting. Those marketing agents and developers are using our SG greed to convince us to buy. 
 
Be prepared to let the money go.
 
If you only plan to stay in that house or unit, go ahead. But must check on the developers and the area. And rem that MY rules can flip overnight.

Aiyoh, when will people realise that the market for resale in malaysia is way over......
 
If you were first mover and have sold by 2013, yes you would make some money.
 
Today? You are screwed.
 
Just ask yourself a very simple question.  
 
Would you buy a resale Johor property for higher than its original price?  Or would you rather buy new from developer?  
 
So if you are holding a johor property now you think you can sell it for 50% 30% 10% higher than your cost? Think again.

guys,
this also happened previously here until our 'ICAC' stepped out their audits.
 
a fren whom helps his father as the main contractor or sub-contractors to many major development projects here . . .  .  he received 100% to 200% upfront payments from mainland developers on his projects in JB where all he needs was to refurbish business contracts approved by the local financial entities...... this means he must have proofs where he had paid his company workers upfront salaries & big fat bonus even where before works completed (or even if works ever begin).  this is regardless if he has the right labor resources as per listed in his company registered there . . . . I was shocked to hear this!
 
so you know how the rest work liao lohhh..... whether the developers 'over or under' declare on the projects, they already siphoned them thru 3rd parties means liao.... finally, they still must top-up in order to complete the projects (again thru' the same or different contractors & resources) from their home financial sources which could be accounted for sloppy investments.
 
sigh . . . .

Iskandar region 'mega mall' scrapped
 
 
The principal developer of Iskandar Malaysia, UEM Sunrise Bhd, has ceased its plan to build one of the region's major projects.Singapore's The Straits Times reported today that no reason was given for the decision to halt plans to build the huge Asian Trade Centre (ATC) in Iskandar, Johor.The newspaper noted that this would likely intensify concerns that the fast-growing region is hitting some "speed bumps".The move has stunned property experts, especially since UEM Sunrise managing director and chief executive Anwar Syahrin Abdul Ajib was quoted in a New Straits Times report last December as saying the company was "in the midst of getting approvals from the relevant authorities" for the project.A property consultant noted the first phase of the centre's development, the China Mall, was supposed to be a catalyst - a mall "even larger than Pavilion in Kuala Lumpur", and meant to attract foreign investors.'Further worries in the property market'"Cancelling it is not good for business. Others may have made plans based on the announcement," the consultant said.Others in the industry said the decision to drop such a large facility would create further worry in the Iskandar property market, which is already weakened by oversupply concerns in the residential sector.ATC-China Mall was to be akin to the Dragon Mart in Dubai that Chinamall Holdings opened in 2004.Anwar Syahrin said last December that UEM Sunrise was building the trade centre because it believed Malaysian products were not being marketed properly."We want international and local manufacturers to showcase their products and do trade shows at the ATC. We are tying up with Chinamall Holdings Pte Ltd from China,” he was quoted as saying in the New Straits Times report.The 1.4 million sq-ft mall, worth more than RM600 million, was supposed to house more than 3,000 merchants offering products such as textiles, gifts, souvenirs, electrical and household appliances, furniture, toys and jewellery.The ATC is in the Nusajaya area, about a five-minute drive from the Johor Baru checkpoint at the Second Link with Singapore.It was to have been part of the 1,840ha Gerbang Nusajaya, the site of the second development phase of Nusajaya city. The area includes Puteri Harbour and the upcoming Nusajaya Tech Park and Motorsports City.UEM Sunrise had signed a memorandum of understanding with Chinamall Holdings in late 2012 to develop the China Mall.According to its website, Chinamall Holdings, which is incorporated in Singapore, is a building materials trader and constructs and operates specialised wholesale markets.The deal was for UEM Sunrise to own the mall, with Chinamall Holdings managing and marketing it on a long-term lease

Bumiputera is such a stupid racist policy
Many countries have this so called policies for the lower rung indigenous people like even the aborigines in Australia but it always back fires and corrupts them even more, even India has it for the tribes and some communities .... but Malaysia really went too far everywhere in this populist policy just to win votes and the so called ministars enriched them selves with licenses/ concessions....etc. Actually this so called bumiputera thingy is a big mess and all the best talent runs away, same thing like India too, to a certain extent, the guys running the airports/ ministries/ administrations all went in via quota system and the cream all went overseas to be top engineers, IT or whatever better meritocratic jobs they could land on

	Board of troubled Malaysian state fund 1MDB set to step down: The Edge

 
Monday, Jun 08, 2015
Reuters



KUALA LUMPUR - The board of directors at Malaysia's state fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd ( 1MDB) will be made to step down as early as July, the Edge Financial Daily reported on Monday, citing unidentified sources.
Dogged by years of controversy over the US$11.6 billion (S$15.8 billion) in debt it has amassed to finance the purchase of power assets as well as alleged mismanagement of its funds, 1MDB last week became the subject of an enquiry by Malaysia's central bank.
1MDB's six-member board of directors is led by Chairman Lodin Wok Kamaruddin and CEO Arul Kanda.
The Edge did not make clear who or what entity would be ordering the board to step down.
The daily also quoted one unidentified source as saying that 1MDB's advisory board, which is chaired by Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak, could also step down.
A 1MDB spokesman declined to comment on the report.
The fund's huge debt burden has weighed on the ringgit and on Malaysia's sovereign credit rating. Najib ordered an audit of 1MDB's accounts by the country's Auditor General earlier this year.

Can any non malaysian investor today honestly tell me that they have been able to sell their property in Malaysia with the last year or so, for a fair profit?
 
Malaysian properties have been going down.
Only stupid buyers are the Sinkies tricked by promises of high returns and pictures of beautiful brochures.
 
Malaysian properties are more for own use.
If you buy it for investment, good luck.
FX loss, asset value loss, liquidity loss.
Now with the scandal and all, underpants may be lost too.

I know a few investors who bought 2-4 units each but cannot sell till TOP, heard pay 10% down and 90% upon TOP, I expect fire house sales soon, many will TOP in 2016.  Too bad foreigners can't buy anything below RM1 million, otherwise can go lowball for a vacation home, so who are these investors going to offload to?  Can't hold for upcycle as well as no rental yield.  Will they default?  I feel sorry for these people, kanna conned big time.  
 
But KL and Penang still ok lah.  Iskandar really fail big time.

I think the key issue is the fx rate and the seemingly endless new developments in iskandar. Malaysia is quite a big and diverse mkt. Gotta resist the urge to generalise. I still am amazed at the level of land reclamation in Iskandar....
 
KL and outskirts still relatively robust but as these have a larger % of local use, buyers/sellers are less exposed to fx fluctuations.
 
That being said, a bunch of PRCs recently bought up all the units (semi-Ds) in a gated estate near my friend's house outside KL. They paid a small premium to buy out the whole place. Maybe they will rename the place to Taman Cina and build a great wall around it. FYI these are 4-storey units and cost Rm5mil+ each. My friend had considered buying a unit before he found out the entire place was sold en bloc LOL.

Ok PRCs bot up some units in some concerted move.
This one is extraoridnary situation. 
 
But after buying, dont even talk about profit, try selling at cost also no takers.....

Actually have for two reasons. One is the currency keeps depreciating, so by the time a friend starts to pay down the mortgage, he needs to pay much less. 
 
Another bought long time ago at 2006. Used as weekend home while he has a HDB locally. 
 
Personally I don't quite trust the sudden changes up north. Too many squatter homes which makes the more affluent groups sitting ducks and targets. 
 
Still a viable option for retirement but sell for profit chance is lower - would rather go for a small apartment locally.

Just like the California Gold Rush of 1849, investors, both local and foreign have been flocking in droves in the past three years to the region of Iskandar Malaysia to purchase property. Now, the party is over and the fat lady is clearing her throat.
In the past three years, it seemed like nothing could stop the Iskandar train. Malaysia’s richest man Robert Kuok, Australian billionaire Lang Walker, Valencia’s adopted son Peter Lim, and a host of other big players had invested huge sums of money in the region.
Kuok had purchased RM198.72 million worth of land last year for a mixed-development project. Walker had bet more than RM2.68 billion on Iskandar Malaysia to become a boomtown, constructing the “largest master-planned urban project ever undertaken in Southeast Asia”. As for Lim, his considerable influence can be felt everywhere in the area that’s roughly three times the size of its neighbour, Singapore. The businessman has his fingers in many Iskandar Malaysia-baked pies, including a premium security business, a medical hub, and the motorsports city.
It’s no wonder that many investors, especially from Singapore, have made a play in the region in the past half a decade, snapping up properties the moment they become available, eagerly anticipating the welcome flood of talents looking for a job and a place to stay. Unfortunately though, the supposed flood is turning out to be a trickle and the weather forecast is only promising more doom and gloom in the near future.
Too many investors, too few inhabitants
When you drive around Iskandar Malaysia, it’s not uncommon to see swathes of empty apartments with no one living inside. Therein lies perhaps the main issue with the region – the lack of a critical mass of people, especially locals, staying in the area.
In the beginning, the majority of property purchases were made by foreigners, particularly Singaporeans, who were seduced by the attractive price tags. After all, they are used to paying princely six-figure sums for a shoebox, so owning a house a few times bigger than their HDB flats for a cheaper price is incredibly enticing.
Unfortunately, the property cooling measures announced in Malaysia’s Budget 2014 have thrown a spanner in the plans of many of these potential investors. Since the beginning of the year, foreigners can only purchase property worth at least RM1 million, have to pay more in Real Property Gains Tax (RPGT), and must contend with a 2% property levy. These moves have whittled the number of potential property investors in Iskandar.
Couple this with the glut of housing development projects being launched by big Chinese developers such as Country Garden and Guangzhou R&F and you’re looking at the classic problem of unchecked growth – supply outrunning demand.
It’s a problem occurring not just in Iskandar but all across Malaysia. A 2014 Property Industry Survey conducted in the first half of this year by the Real Estate and Housing Developers’ Association Malaysia makes for depressing reading.
Less than half of the 10,189 units launched in the first half this year were sold
90% of developers in Malaysia experienced a slowdown in property sales
More than half of local buyers had problems getting financing for property purchases
If Malaysians already have issues trying to buy homes that cost below RM1 million, it’s even less likely that they would be able to afford the high-end properties in Iskandar. At the moment, the resale market is practically non-existent.
In Iskandar, purchase bookings have been reportedly down at least 20% and the outlook for 2015 is just as pessimistic.
Too many empty houses, too few businesses
A thriving business and social hub requires a careful mix of houses and businesses. The equation seems simple on paper – investments create jobs, jobs attract workers, workers need a place to stay. Reality, however, is far more complicated and the master planners and authorities in Iskandar are only starting to realise how difficult it can be.

A disproportionate amount of investments has been poured into housing while forays into businesses have been lagging behind. The only industry keeping pace so far is manufacturing. With many housing projects set to be complete in the next few years, analysts are wondering whether there will be enough rental demand from incoming workers to fill up these completed homes. If there aren’t, current property owners will be fighting over scraps and it’s a race to the bottom of the barrel.
What makes the situation difficult to read is the lack of transparency from the Iskandar Regional Development Authority (IRDA), who only releases quarterly figures on monetary investment but not job creation or population growth. The only projection is that Iskandar Malaysia is estimated to have 3.17 million people by 2025, of which 66% is of working age.
The rest is anyone’s guess.
Too little information, too many possible vagaries
Former Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew said in his book One Man’s View of the World, “Let’s wait and see how Iskandar develops. This is an economic field of cooperation in which, you must remember, we are putting investments on Malaysian soil. And at the stroke of a pen, they can take it over.”
His words are beginning to ring true, with the new property measures instituted this year. Previously, property developers were rolling out the red carpet for buyers – Country Garden even chartered several buses to bring hundreds of interested investors to the carnival launch of their new properties. Today, the party atmosphere is gone.
The business dealings in the Iskandar region, notably the sale of 116 acres of prime land to Chinese developers Guangzhou R&F for RM4.5 billion, have also ruffled a few feathers. Smaller local developers are being squeezed out of the market thanks to a new bill that gave the monarch sweeping executive powers and sentiments on the ground have been unfavourable of late.
One of the biggest developers in Malaysia, UEM Sunrise, is already reconsidering its business holdings in Iskandar and the company’s CEO has mentioned that it will “reduce its dependency on Iskandar, where it has approximately 60% of its total land bank”.
The suspension of Forest City, a mixed-use development on four reclaimed lands, since the middle of this year has also been a big blow.
Rocky politics, lack of comprehensive information, and more pull-outs from big players will only further shake investor confidence, evidenced by the slowdown of growth in the Iskandar region.
Is Iskandar too big to fail?

There is one thing going for Iskandar – the RM150 billion worth of investments from influential people in the region, which is a huge sum of money to just go to waste.
The Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail project, slated to be completed by 2020, might also be a catalyst for growth in Iskandar since one of the proposed stops is in Nusajaya, which is within the Iskandar Malaysia region. That, however, is far off into the future.
If you’re thinking about buying a house in Iskandar to stay in during the weekends and the holidays, you have a wealth of places to choose from right now. However, if you’re considering investing in Iskandar Malaysia, do so with caution, due diligence, and with an exit strategy, if any, that is at least two decades down the road. The train is definitely slowing down. Whether it’s permanently stopping remains to be seen.

Its fine if you went in with your eyes wide open as a bet like the big boys.
They can afford to lose, life goes on. 
 
 Otherwise, get ready to retire there.

Guys, you all need to understand that for those who invest there, that investment amount is just a small change in their portfolio. And with the declining ringgit, it became an even smaller change.
 
So these people have the capital to ride it out whether it is 10 years or 20 years. The risk to reward ratio is worth taking.
 
But for those who invested to flip, then sorry, I think they have got the wrong boat.

Malaysia’s home prices ‘seriously unaffordable’
The Malaysian InsiderThe Malaysian Insider – Mon, Aug 24, 2015
 
 
 
Malaysia's average house prices are more than four times the median income of its population, making them "seriously unaffordable", research by Khazanah Research Institute (KRI) has revealed.
 
Kuala Lumpur has especially been branded as "severely unaffordable" with house prices 5.4 times higher than the median income in the capital city.
 
The maximum median range for housing prices compared to median income should not be more than three times the median income.
 
But only one state in Malaysia fits the maximum median range: Malacca, where housing prices are three times higher than the median range.
 
The rest are rated between "moderately" and "severely" unaffordable.
 
Terengganu is the most severely unaffordable of all the states, with median multiple affordability standing at 5.5.
 
In Kuala Lumpur, the median house price is now RM490,000 per unit, almost double the median house price ranges in all other states.
 
Penang was also rated as severely unaffordable while Selangor, Malaysia's wealthiest state, has a median house price of RM300,000, putting it at the moderately unaffordable level.
 
The research was authored by Dr Suraya Ismail, Intan Nadia Jalil, and Puteri Marjan Megat Muzafar and titled "Making Housing Affordable".
 
It said that in the case of Kuala Lumpur, housing prices meant the distribution of house prices was "significantly skewed".
 
"Of the new properties launched in Kuala Lumpur in 2014, there were no properties launched below the RM250,000 to RM500,000 price bracket, with the bulk of the newly-launched properties situated in the RM500,000 to RM1 million bracket," it said.
 
The research was launched today by KRI chairman Tan Sri Nor Mohamed Yakcop, and entailed recommendations to reform the housing industry.
 
According to the report, institutional reforms are needed to change Malaysia's approach to housing policies. – August 24, 2015.

Malacca can go twice a month. Not very far. Driving about 2 hrs.  
 
Penang must take aeroplane. Twice yearly maybe. Go there either you don't recognise the home or the home found you strange.

penang better food choices as Malacca
 
But hospital wise, Mokota is in Malacca
 
with HSR. and IF the plan do not delay, Malacca is a shutter train to and fro Singapore. May make it worthwhile to work in SG and shuttle back to Malacca on the Friday weekend. Monday back in SG. 
 
The rest of the 5 days, get a shoe box or better still, when Air BnB becomes acceptable, get a condo and rent out one room.

this is already a known fact when iskandar region was launch
many spore investors also knew it but they just want to "bet" and see who catch the falling knife
money is made when there are winner and loser ... the question is who is winner and who is loser
there are sporean who bought east ledang, ledang heights, puteri harbour, horizon hill and let go and make some handsome proft 
 
spore land size 700km square with 5.5M population ...
iskandar region is 2200km square (3x whole of spore) and with how many people?
 

 
I supposed the reverse is true..
 
You be expecting a cheaper rate per sqft and buy a bigger unit and not feel cramp like living in a shoe box

The fact that you asked this question, i take it that you have some inclinations towards buying.
 
For me, a big "NO".
 
If you buy and stay for good, it is one consideration. If you want to buy and hope to make money, then i suggest you look lease where or at some other products. Property is not an investment concept, for the Malaysians. It is a home.

Froeigners must invest min RM1million, so it is principal guaranteed if you buy exactly RM1 million... provided you can sell it to another foreigner or you can buy prime property in KL or Penang.  how long to take back the money is another question.    Locals are moving money out, you think you know better?   I very tempted to buy KLCC area but scared lose my pant, so I waiting to buy more undervalued stocks in Singapore, China and HK.

I agreed with Latio2005A to certain extend... 
 
Currently, to buy for primary motive of investment. Can be risky ...
 
But If long Term, It is always good to considered one location prime and cheap... Most are freehold unlike SG market now which is only leasehold... 
 
But nonetheless, there are always others better alternatives if you are purely into investment. 
 
My personal take, if used for home like what Latio2005A said, can be one consideration.. And for long term, there might be some form of appreciation..

Hello, what logic?
 
Is not using RM to buy in SGD leh, is using SGD to buy in RM!
Based on political situation, what if SGD become x5 RM? You cry until cow come home also no use.
 
Please dun based SG's property trend here to be same as MY. Over there a RM 1million condo will remain around the same after 10 years, even for a posh one located in KL.

As Explained, i agreed with what Latio Says ... Investment is risky ... 
 
But for long term especially with intention of own stay, can still considered...
 
If you are going to buy a unit at RM1 Million Today using SGD... It will be cheaper when SGD Strengthen rather then weaken..
 
And property price always went up regardless of country in prime location.... RM 1million condos within KLCC will appreciate..
 
However, i must agreed when you say its the same if taking SG into consideration... 
 
Although price appreciate, if currency drop... Basically you did not gain at all..

Well if you put it this way. It mean you are buying sole for staying and not investment. This one is up to you already. As outside I can't comment. 
 
Just make sure the appreciation and more than the depreciation of the RM. Why I'm saying this? Cos I got a friend who bought house near KLCC some 20 years ago. Now they are facing the same problem as I mention. House is too old and hard sell, the value of Ringgit devalue against SGD faster than it's appreciation.
 
Now stuck. The problem is old house in KL are not as hot as in SG since their land is abundant and so old house not in demand. cannot command good price.

Many stocks in AP has dropped more than 30%, go do some homework lah.  Cheap can become cheaper so only buy those with defensive business and pay good dividends.

KL with yield can sell one but currency risk I cannot comment.  However, I think RM is undervalued based on the underlying economy but with the type of govt they have up north, cheap can only get cheaper (currency wise).

exactly, its not a total doomsday to buy MY property.
 
let's say buy at RM1 millon, for a small unit, at KL or Penang or Malacca. 
 
RM1 million is only S$330,000 at today's rate.  How much pants can you lose only?  What is S$330k? Will the unit value drop to S$50k? Not possible right, unless there is another Asian Financial Crisis?  A typical WORST situation is it might drop to $200k.  So you only lose S$150k paper value.  Our SG properties are already losing more than S$150k now.......
 
So the buyer got to ask himself whether can he afford to lose this S$150k paper value.  But of coz, we need to consider currency risk. That's another story.
 
The quantum is small, so the risk of losing too much pants is v small.  If buyer buy those big quantum ones, then the risk is really big.
 
and yes, MY property is not for investment.  Its only meant for own stay.  Those who buy hoping for investment, can wait long long.  Yes, there is a limited window for buyer to quickly sell for some profit.  But buyer need to be sharp and fast about selling it.

An uncle of mine bought a freehold condominium unit in the 90s for S$550k. Today, he cannot find any buyers even though he has advertised it for sale at S$100k. The highest offer he received a few months ago was S$80k.
 
In the resale market over in JB, supply outstrips demand. Even the market for new properties has lost its lustre.
 
Thus, the hypothetical situation that you have cited where S$330k falls to S$50k is possible.

it is not paper loss, is real loss. Couple with exchange loss,  it can be as good as write off.
 
Penang and KL you can still find good investment (not the RM1 mil type), malacca you can skip.

Property markets need to be sustained with real demand, otherwise they are no more than just bubbles.
 
Real demand can only come from genuine buyers who purchase properties for their own use (whether commercial, industrial or residential) and for that to happen, jobs have to be created. 
 
If a property market continues going up in spite of weakening economic fundamentals e.g. job creation slows or becomes negative, then it is just a bubble waiting to be popped.
 
And bubbles don't pop gradually, they burst with catastrophic results.

Actually as long as the bank don't ask for top up, its pretty safe ..
 
As KBW said, 30 K is 2 room flat for 99 years
 
COE is 60K for 10 years..
 
To me 330,000 is a Jag XK for 10 years...
 
As the price of house "may" drop it does to equal to price of Land will also drop.
 
Just like Gold, minimum labour cost means break even is 1030. IF drop to below 900 is really under value for Gold.
 
So if we cost in Land and Labour cost plus if you get something near the HSR, even if it does not appreciate, I think the rental yield maybe quite ok...

If you are thinking of buying a house in Malaysia for investment, I suggest don't. Unless you are moving to Malaysia soon and is staying. There's still so much unused land in Malaysia, so I think it's unlikely that the property prices will increase.

Country Garden folks have given several interviews recently about their views of their Johor investment.
 
Johor can emulate the transformation of Dubai. 
Country Garden can bring in the Chinese buyers to populate the developments.
A HK- Shenzhen relationship with Sg.
 
They are putting big $ into this idea. Success is not guaranteed, I am wondering if being being an early bird has any advantages, given that KL and Johor decision makers do not work closely together. For example.. KL's 1Mil restriction while Johor was promoting foreign investment. 
 
But NETT NETT NETT... , a densely populated, modern and progressive Johor is in Sg interest, since Sg alone lacks the population base to be a vibrant marketplace. It would be nice if Johor gives Sg citizens special priviledges like buying farms etc.

You can rent land dirt cheap from Bumis.
 
But, as with all businesses like in SG, they will start crying and lamenting no locals want to work and lobby for more foreigners.

I have an opportunity to buy one unit at KM1, newly launched freehold condominium located in Bukit Jalil, KL
 
1335sqf. RM$800K. It's a resale unit. Current owner bought brand new 2 years ago, at about RM$750+k. Left the unit empty until now. So no one stay before. 
 
View is good. Better than many other units.
 
Is this worth?  I got MY relatives already staying at this condo. So my thoughts is that I won't go wrong with this condo, when MY relatives put their money there.

When I think about Malaysia properties, I face the issue of maximum loan or full cash down.
 
Full cash down will take the full brunt of the currency depreciation.
 
Max loan will bear the full 5-6% interest rate for Malaysia properties.
 
How did you finance this?

I plan to take 50% loan, RM$400K. Based on 4.25% interest for 25 years, it will be RM$1K per month, ie only $300+ SIN.  
I can even take lower loan amount if I wan
 But I just take ballpark figure $400k to work out the bank loan.
 
As for bank loans, I don't need to worry abt finding the best, coz MY relatives can help on this. All are seasoned property owners
 
 
The most important question is this condo worth buying

If you are Malaysian, its different liao
If you have relatives there, its different liao
 
But if you think you can make money in Singapore dollar , singaporean terms.  
Forget it!  The resale is so difficult almost non existent.
Even if you offer RM700k, the seller will also let go.
Try it if you dont believe.
 
My best wishes to you in 2017

Moreover now RM so low, i think worth getting it moreover its below RM1m and at KL area. But after buy may need to take more trips to KL.

if for self stay..
 
there are so many more condos in the vicinity from which to chose from .. no rush.. take ur time to search ard
 
if for the sake of relatives..

Rental is hard, I know. Was checking some MY property portal. That rental is only RM$2 PSF.  Pathetic by our standards. 
Not for rental. If I really buy, will be for self stay and long term. The most is try for airbnb rental.

If rental is really pathetic,  you may want to consider renting it long term. Give yourself 5 years to decide.  While renting if you decide you love the place so much,  you can buy anytime after that. There are lots of people who bought and regret so think carefully.

That is true in KL for many years, you buy Phase 1 and offload near completion.  My friend made a lot of monies using this modus operandi in the last 10 years but now stuck with 2 very expensive one.  The residential market in KL is quite dead now.

But KL you will still get some queries as its expanding always and you can benchmark prices against each others  and new people from suburbs or Kampungs coming in and also foreigners too, but JB nothing much to talk about except for our SGP's making day trips & go supermarketing and makan makan. My friends whom bought landed in JB like staying there just to "jaga-jaga" the property from foreigners; particularly Indonesians whom will just "take over" yor property; strip it bare too somemore;

A kidnap attempt in Malaysia was thwarted when witnesses gave chase to the kidnap vehicle, Sin Chew Daily reported on Wednesday (Jan 11).
The angry mob gave the suspected kidnappers a beating, and even set fire to their van, the report by the Chinese newspaper said.
The daughter of a curtain factory owner in Selangor was grabbed near her home at about 5pm on Tuesday.

Her shouts attracted the attention of motorists nearby, who chased the kidnappers' white van in their cars and motorcycles.
Alarmed, the suspects tossed the woman, who is in her 20s, out of their vehicle. In their panic, they also bumped into several other vehicles while attempting to get away.

 
 
 

 
The van finally stopped when it crashed into a large tree.
Their pursuers dragged the two men from the van and beat them up before handing them to the police.
The two men, aged 25 and 35, are detained at Sungai Buloh police station.
Police found a parang, masks, gloves and rope in the van, Sin Chew said.
The angry crowd later set fire to the vehicle, which is believed to be stolen

Dr M is worried of 1 M new citizens for Johor and we are hoping to squeeze in 7 millions. We sell like nobody and he prefers not to sell.
 
Honestly, I cannot imagine JB attracting 1 million foreign buyers lah. So he don't have to worry too much. haha

I can see 1m Singaporeans moving to JB after retirement.
 
Not sure if they will buy or rent as the RM keeps going down.
 
Also does not mean property prices will go up and they can
 
build 1m more homes in Msia.

i cann agree with you that if you are planning to retire and not wanting tie down your cash, you wont buy but rent. 
 
once you rent,  you are free to move. so would you want to stay out in JB or move around in malaysia or even neighboring countries of even lower cost of living. 
 
end of the day,  the idea os 1m buying to either stay or rent is difficult to visualise.

Looking forward to the old brand of politics.
No sissy talk, not stupid nonsense, hardline and strong
 
LKY not here to train the young politicians of Singapore
Let the Sifu from another Sect train them, hard and well.
 
See if our Singapore politicians can cross swords with LKY’s counterpart effectively.
We truly need many more tests like these.
 
Huat ah huat ah huat huat huat!
