Hi bros 
 

Need a recommendation for reliable distributor for a CCTV to be installed outside the house gate as my neighborhood has been experiencing housebreaking and stolen shoes and belongings outside corridors almost every week. My 2 pairs of shoes got stolen lately.
 

When has Singapore become such an unsafe country?  :angry:

Unsafe? You blame the country for your own personal carelessness? Why leave your precious shoes outside?
 

Everytime I see those people leave their phone, laptop, bags in public area and they went on do their thing, as if angel will guard over their property, I seriously hope their item get stolen Everytime! See one time take one time

If you're living in HDB, technically it is not legal by law to install a camera that covers the common corridor areas.

You can only install cams inside your unit. But of course, I'm sure many people do find a way to get around this.

Install GPS chip in one of your shoes. Track down the thief, call police surround the compound he's hiding in and make the arrest. LoL...
 

Just keep your precious shoes indoors lah.
