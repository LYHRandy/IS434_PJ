Private home sales jump in May
 
By Ng Baoying, Channel NewsAsia | Posted: 16 June 2008 2150 hrs
 
 
SINGAPORE: There has been a sharp pick-up in the number of private home sales in May - more than 441 homes changed hands, about 56 per cent higher than the previous month.
 
Despite the spike, analysts said it is premature to talk about any strong rebound in the property sector.
 
Colliers International's director of research and advisory, Tay Huey Ying, said: "I wouldn't say that this set of May numbers give a positive indication that the market is moving. But I think looking at last six months' developer launches and sales volume, the market has reached a stable state, with launch volumes at 400-450 range, and sales volumes at 300-350 range.
 
"The fact that market can reach this consistently, despite prices remaining stubbornly firm, this means that the current price levels are well supported by homebuyers."
 
Analysts added that even though May numbers come as a pleasant surprise, this bump upwards is also typical of the yearly property cycle.
 
Propnex Realty CEO Mohamed Ismail said: "The number has picked up a fair quantity compared to April. Generally speaking, the second quarter usually does better than the first quarter. Things start to pick up, and in the month of April, May, June, July, one can expect (the) numbers to grow."
 
Ms Tay pointed out: "Monthly fluctuations in developer sale and launch volume (are) to be expected. But this set of May numbers... is indeed a very pleasant surprise."
 
About 61 per cent of homes sold in May were under S$1,000 per square foot, suggesting that purchasers are genuine homebuyers, rather than speculators.
 
Analysts said a large decline in prices is unlikely going forward, although a marginal dip of one to two per cent may be possible.
 
"This is, to an extent, a buyer's market. On the other hand, developers are not bringing the price down drastically. Many (are) holding prices because (the) fundamentals of economy and demand of such properties (are) still there. So I don't expect prices to slide down," said Mr Ismail.
 
Knight Frank and CB Richard Ellis also noted that prices have stayed firm, contrary to market expectations.
 
Although some analysts called this a buyer's market, they also noted that sellers are taking a more measured approach.
 
Colliers said developers are likely to stay off launching luxury and super luxury projects until there is a clearer sign of market recovery. - CNA/ac

'Old money' props rise in luxury home sales
 
Prices hold firm surprisingly; investment climate may have stabilised, analysts say
 
By ARTHUR SIM
 
 
(SINGAPORE) Developer sales of new homes jumped to 441 units in May from 284 units in April, with some property consultants already calling it a 'sharp rebound'.
 
 
Strong take-up: At UOL's 100-unit Nassim Park Residences, 39 of 70 units launched were sold in May at a median price of $2,929 per square foot, URA data show
 
While May sales were still relatively low compared to 2007 levels, several launches in prime and city-fringe locations did well.
 
According to Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) data, at UOL's 100-unit Nassim Park Residences, 39 of 70 units launched were sold at a median price of $2,929 per square foot (psf). Sources also told BT that most of these units were sold to Singapore's 'old money'.
 
Savills Singapore director (marketing and business development) Ku Swee Yong said: 'Based on what we have seen in the past few months, high net worth individuals (HNWIs) have not been affected by the slowdown in the global economy.'
 
While these buyers may be more 'picky' now, 'they don't want to wait for prices to fall just to save 5 per cent', he said. And with banks generally offering low interest rate returns, these HNWIs are looking to 'park' their money in real estate instead.
 
A check with UOL revealed that since last week, Nassim Park Residences has been marketed overseas and more than 50 units have now been sold. UOL Group's general manager of marketing, Dolly Lian said that as things stand, more than 30 per cent of the buyers are foreigners and the average selling price is $3,300 psf. This is higher than $3,000-$3,200 psf average selling price that some market watchers expected.
 
It is understood that most of the foreign buyers are from Indonesia.
 
Another popular development in May was Macly Group's 102-unit Vutton, with 72 units sold at a median price of $1,225 psf. A market watcher said this is in the same price range as UOL's Pavilion 11, also off Moulmein Road, which was sold in 2007.
 
Also selling well in May was Ascend Land's 106-unit The Verve, off Balestier Road. During the month, 42 units were transacted at a median price of $985 psf. According to URA data, 84 units have been sold so far. In April, eight units were sold at a median price of $1,055, while in March the median price was $1,187 psf.
 
Collier's International's director for research and advisory Tay Huey Ying said that while the rebound in sales activity could be 'just a monthly fluctuation, it may also be a sign that most genuine buyers have come to accept that the current price levels have reached a fair level'.
 
Ms Tay noted that the number of new launches increased 74 per cent in May from April. 'This encouraging response could be just what is needed to trigger more of such launches in the coming months,' she said.
 
She added, however, that developers will remain cautious with regard to pricing, 'as buyers in today's market tend to be price-sensitive'.
 
CB Richard Ellis executive director (residential) Joseph Tan said: 'Based on the transactions in May, contrary to market expectations, there was no downward adjustment of prices.'
 
Luxury prices in particular 'seemed to hold firm' as projects like Boulevard Vue, Scotts Square and Nassim Park Residences maintained $3,000-psf levels, he said. And in the eastern and western parts of Singapore, prices held at $800-$900 psf at projects including Breeze by the East, Blu Coral, The Ambrosia, The Lakeshore and Crystal Heights.
 
Still, not everyone was as sanguine about the state of the property market.
 
Knight Frank director (research and consultancy) Nicholas Mak said that while total new sales in the Core Central Region (CCR), Rest of Central Region (RCR) and Outside Central Region (OCR) rose 60.9 per cent month on month, the OCR saw a 14.6 per cent drop in sales volume month on month.
 
According to Mr Mak: 'Essentially, the slight rise in sales volume can be attributed to some stability in investment sentiment. However, it should be noted that this escalation is still 32 per cent below the 12-month average figure.'
 
Looking at take-up rates (new sales versus new launches) in the three regions, Jones Lang LaSalle local director and head of research (South-east Asia) Chua Yang Liang said these were 87 per cent for CCR, 84 per cent for RCR and 146 per cent for OCR.
 
He said the strong take-up rates in CCR and RCR were a result of 'latent demand spurred on by softening prices', while the take-up rate in OCR was 'the result of low supply of new launches over what appears to be a minimum demand threshold - an average of 113 units over the past six months - in the region'.

New private home sales up 55%
 
Highest monthly figure so far this year follows softening of prices, surge in total units launched
 
By Joyce Teo, Property Correspondent
 
 
SINGAPORE'S private residential property market has started showing some signs of life after several months in the doldrums, thanks in part to an easing of prices.
 
Last month, developers sold 441 new homes, excluding executive condominiums, a sharp 55 per cent jump on the figure for April - albeit a low base - of 284 home sales.
 
That made May the best month so far this year, according to the monthly sales figures released by the Urban Redevelopment Authority yesterday.
 
The improved sales came on the back of 474 new homes launched by developers - a 75 per cent surge over April - though many of the units sold were from earlier launches.
 
Still, consultants caution against reading too much into the latest figures. They say the market is generally still taking a breather, as many buyers prefer to stay on the sidelines.
 
Sales have improved from a very low base but they remained 32 per cent below the 12-month average, said Knight Frank's director of research and consultancy, Mr Nicholas Mak.
 
The figures 'do not necessarily imply that the private residential market has overcome the protracted lull sparked off by global economic woes', he said.
 
'The market is still at a plateau. Going forward, we will still see range- bound prices and volume of between 300 and 600 units a month. Sentiment is still very cautious,' he said.
 
Jones Lang LaSalle's head of research for South-east Asia, Dr Chua Yang Liang, said median prices have eased.
 
The chief executive of PropNex, Mr Mohamed Ismail, said that most May sales were done at a median price of below $1,000 per sq ft (psf), a stark contrast to the end of last year when the median price of almost two-thirds of all sales was over $1,000 psf.
 
'Upon closer scrutiny, we can see that less than 50 per cent of the units launched were actually sold.'
 
Also, slightly over half the sales were from earlier launches, he said.
 
Still, there are a few bright spots. While some are struggling to sell, developer Macly Group sold 72 out of 102 units of Vutton in the Novena area at $1,057 psf to $1,416 psf.
 
In the luxury market, the 100-unit Nassim Park Residences is the star performer, logging in sales of over 50 units since its soft launch at end-May.
 
As these are large apartments, prices range from about $10 million to a whopping $19.5 million, sources said.
 
The prime Nassim Road project - being developed by UOL Group, Kheng Leong and Orix Corp - has already hit a high of $3,800 psf - far better than its low of $2,318 psf.
 
One buyer is Mr Wee Ee Cheong, son of UOL chairman Wee Cho Yaw, who bought a penthouse for $18.33 million.
 
Just over 30 per cent of the buyers are foreigners. The project has already been launched in Jakarta and Hong Kong, said UOL.
 
Another luxury development Scotts Square in the Orchard area registered sales of four units at a median price of $3,818 psf last month.
 
The relatively strong sales in central Singapore were the result of 'latent demand spurred on by softening prices', said Dr Chua.
 
'Going forward, we reckon that developers are likely to keep prices competitive to keep the market demand stable,' he said. As long as prices remain affordable, price-sensitive buyers will return, he added.
 
Savills Singapore's director of business development and marketing, Mr Ku Swee Yong, said the level of transactions and price levels seen last month are sustainable.

Dismal private property sales despite lower prices
 
TAN HUI LENG
 
huileng@mediacorp.com.sg
 
 
PRIVATE property sales by developers remained weak last month, with 441 units sold.
 
That may be up 55 per cent from the 284 units sold in April, but over 3,000 new units remained unsold. That was despite developers cutting their prices for homes in 18 developments last month. Median prices for The Verve along Jalan Rajah, for example, dropped 17 per cent from $1,187 per sq ft (psf) in March to $985 psf in May.

didn't I already said that this is a good time to shop around and try to seek bargains rather than keep waiting for the prices to come crashing down?
 
Prices come down sharply is not going to happen. If you guys are waiting for that, you can keep on waiting. It is strange that some people say recession coming and property prices will drop like a stone so it is better to wait. It's not going to happen, whether recession or not.

Normally in recession, property prices will drop due to lack of demand.
 
But I suspect that for this time, recession in Spore will not affect property prices. Reason being that this recession is mainly triggered by high oil price.
 
High oil price, while detrimental to many, also bring prosperity to some of the local sectors like the marine and shipbuilding industry. So not everyone is affected. Oil is also predominantly an Asia commodity, so those in Asia benefited from oil will be very happy to snap up properties around Asia during a recession, giving some support to local property prices. In any case, during a recession , stock market will be down and the only places to park their money is in gold and properties.
 
So don't even think that the coming recession (if we ever have one soon) will bring down property prices. I don't think it will and the current property prices won't peak until 2011 or 2012

already said in the beginning of the year to some members that luxury properties and general properties would not really drop in prices , but some still have the 1990 mind set that it will drop like stone and can pick up cheap apartments
 
the current market is sold to global players for 2008
 
1990 was local sell to local,
 
in the past 90% of the neighbours in my condo are locals but these day i have neighbours from India, Japan, US, Ireland, China  , Taiwan, Malaysia, UK, Australia, Indonesia and etc
 
 
the current market is supported by FT not locals, that why prices dont drop that much.

I am on the vested side.  Currently comfortably holding 2 units in prime districts.  Not the high end one but more like mid tier type of around $1600-$2000 psf in current transacted prices.  But I bought low a few years ago so now i am trying to decide whether to hold on and continue to collect rent or take opportunity to cash in.  Sell into strength, know what i mean.
 
How long do you think this good sales volume/interest will last?  Assuming that mostly foreigners will be the ones interested in my properties.

dude that's one nice condo.  i passed on the lincoln modern a few years ago when it was offered to me at $1100 psf and there were no takers around.  that was around the same time when the paterson was also asking around the same price.
 
i liked the lincoln modern's design (SCDA architects) but it was surrounded by too many empty plots of land back then... we now know what that meant.
 
in any case i'm looking to sell my props, not buy...

i was reading the official media as well - average pay here is 4.4k so after inflation everyone still has 3.9k thereabouts. so you believe the local media?  
 
anyway, 5.5% growth with 6% inflation is a 0.5% effective contraction for the economy this year. a lot of the growth is generated simply because more people are coming in - meaning that the average growth per person is actually much smaller, may even be negative. 
 
anyway, the local media will just report what the "analysts" say as "news". they do not question the analysts, or put up their own analyses. 
 
my view is that demand for new properties will stay weak for some time to come; like i say before, the bullish ones like you have bought at least a couple and looking to sell. the bearish ones who didn't bought when the mkt was looking good, wouldn't buy when the mkt is looking bad. so who's left to buy? 
 
supply on the other hand boils down to people keeping their jobs, mortgage remaining low, rentals stay strong. if these hold, price will stay at this level for a while. 
 
but i think developers are in for a very rough ride.

Hmmm...well, i think the this sort of statments are generally more for those who want to buy speculative. 
 
Otherwise, for long to medium (not those buy/sell in a few years type) term investors with lots of cash will tend to hold out more a little.

For me, I would believe that the prices of private in semi prime districts will come down about 10% max. within the next 1 year. I do not believe that prices will drop like a rock by up to 30% as what some analyst said.

Rivergate $1500 psf you sure or not. Cannot find in the newspaper.  What floor and facing?  If $1500 psf got some upside to cheong. F&N's Martin Place, location is not so good, is selling more than that. 8 Rodyk is selling damn expensive man!  $1500psf for Rivergate sounds cheap by comparison.

$1100 psf for Lincoln Modern was when the unit already TOP for a year and SC Global still cannot sell.  It is a nice building and all but..
 
$1100 psf seems cheap now but a few years ago it was considered expensive.

Today's  BT, HONG KONG - A luxury flat in Hong Kong has sold for HK$225 million (US$28.8 million), the most expensive apartment per square foot ever sold in Asia, a report said on Wednesday. 
 
HK$41,000 per square foot
 
Hope Singapore would see such prices too.

i went to see Lincoln Modern when it was first up for sale.
 
Didnt like any development around that whole place becos there is only a one way road that services the whole area.  simply hate this sort of road layout personally.
 
so even if $1000psf I also wont buy.
