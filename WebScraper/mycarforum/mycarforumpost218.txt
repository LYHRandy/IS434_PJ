Huh? U mean if I left something in the car.. I need to send the car down to basement lvl before I can retrieve the item, and then send the car back up?

The video shows.. the carpark area. got Exit door sign,.. surely means got door from the unit to the carpark?

From the main road can't really see the car park in that fish tank, each unit cost around $8mil or $3k psf.

With 30 storey, owner might have to queue for that stocker to bring down the car one at a time.

This is mech car park system, the driver have to get alight from the car. I initially thought that the driver can ride the elevator with the car.

But i think the space could be better utilized, like bigger living room etc. Its wasted space which the owner is paying for.  Unless you have a supercar you like to drool from the living room.
