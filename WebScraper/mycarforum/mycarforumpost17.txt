Its a repurchased flat at Blk 44 Jalan Bahagia - see Flat
 

This isnt a unsold BTO unit - lease commencement was in the 1970s! Its a 1st floor unit somemore. Only positive thing is that it is near the Kallang River.
 

Edit - If you look on Google maps - the unit is part of a row of semi-detached. My parents say HDB used to build a small no of such units in the Kallang and Queenstown area.

Technically its a 3-room - coz living room at 1st floor and 2 rooms on 2nd floor, but HDB is wrong to put it as a 3 room flat lah.

The root cause comes from new flats pricing model. The flats should have based on the base price with HDB selling with little profit. 
 

Example :

I believe HDB can be priced at 180k of first time buyer of a 4 room flat and 280k of a 5 room flat. The cost of building these flats are lower than these pricing, I believe so. If these pricing model, it will naturally bring down the pricing expectation of the open market HDB. Coz it does not make many senses to buy from open market at these rocket prices, while first timer can buy direct from HDB at 180k-4room or 280k-5room and willing to wait from 2 years.  
 
 

I still dun understand, why the gov pak the new flats in tandem with the open market price. This shouldn't be happen in the first place. As was mentioned by many, HDB supposed to be a basic housing for the citizens. If the gov wants to, it can change the policy to make it happen.

If they don't peg to open market, it is as good as passing $$$ to the buyers when they sell at open market price.
 

While one can say that they do not control market prices but they can influence by their policies.
 

Stop building flats and more FTs influx = Higher property prices. Get it?

passing $$ to buyers is just an excuse. With MOP of 5 yrs, there is uncertainty in terms of how much $$ buyers can make after 5 yrs.
 

I think the real reason is that if HDB starts selling 5-rm flats in tiong bahru for 300K to 400K (which shld be the real 'subsidized' price), it will correct the market straight away. Can;t afford to do that as they need to keep prices on a slow upward trend to offer artificial comfort to ppl that our lives are getting better with asset appreciation.

my opinion is that the attractiveness of landed is for the space.
 

a 106sqm "landed" is akin to a 1.1L camry. 
 

For 800K, i will go and get a 120sqm flat in the same area.

Could be facing West sun or has no view at all.
 

I ever notice one BTO in Punggol the whole block no people take, because it front is completely blocked by another block, and face West. Then another block in the same batch face East and no blockage (face the waterway) everyone want, even the 2nd floor also taken.

When i was searching for house..i ever saw in 1 block in a mature estate..the whole row of corner flats was put up for sale by HDB.

I was wondering whether HDB kicked out everyone or got ghost, dun allow pple stay there.
 

Then found out later that row of corner flats #02 to #12 was previously HDB rental flats.

屋龄40年设计如排屋　三房组屋叫价80万
 

屋龄40年，附近又没有地铁站，黄埔老式三房式双层排屋式组屋，叫价近80万元，贵过四、五房式组屋单位！
 

建屋发展局上月27日推售3328个剩余组屋单位，其中一个位于加冷/黄埔区的三房式单位，售价竟高达79万5000元，在网上引起哗然。
 

有公众指出，这个三房式单位面积不大，仅106平方公尺，附近又没地铁站，索价近80万元，贵过那一带的许多四、五房式单位，非常不可思议。

Let the party goes on. Just dun know when this party ends. If this property boom ends, it will be a terrible one. Classic story again "This time is different". Property demand/ supply market never meet each other. Sunday Times have shown, some have bought properties during the last property boom in 1996-97, are still sitting in a lost or breakeven. So in any investments, what matter most is the point of cycle of purchase.

Most of them can't afford, need to live on hand down by their parents. If more than 1 kid, good luck!
 

So start young, teach them to be frugal and how to manage money.
 

Too many gadgets and branded goods to lure them into spending. Even if they can afford, it will be later in Life and pay for their housing all the way to their graves.
