You paint yourself is cheapest. One can of paint around $50. Just buy 3 cans same colour and one roller, plus some brushes. All in less than $200.

If for selling purposes, suggest DIY. cos most likely only need to touch up here and there. 
 
$1300 is really cheap. I rem this was the rate for 4rm flat when I enquire last time.

I think you are quite right... I'll take a good look at the walls that needs to be painted and will do some touch up... What paints are good for covering cracks?

Iam not too sure...but most should be ok. if you want to be safe, those shops selling paint shld be able to advise you which type of paint is betta for your requirement..there are certain types that have less paint odour but not as lasting...since you are selling, no need to get the most lasting paint..

The paint need only to last till I sell the house. Anyway, the buyer would most likely change the colour scheme anyway.

Painting is the easiest of all DIY work. Why not just buy your own paint and brushes? The most it will take is a few days work if your put in a few hours a day. 
 

I saved myself a packet by doing it myself. Now everytime I don't bother calling those guys to do it... somemore... my workmanship is miles better!

Think its best you get a professional painter to do the job plus plastering the crank and all. Simple reason being the flat would looked so much better for just less than 0.4% of the costs of the flat (just an estimate). 
If you truly think the job had been well done, you can comfortably pushed up another 5 ~ 10K more to your initial intended price.
Don't sweat the small stuff

Come to think of it as initially started the thread. I would DIY as I realise that it's not necessary to paint the entire house. The main colour of my house is white so might touch up here and there. What I would want to do up is the solid coloured walls. My contractor designed the colour scheme in such a way that all my rooms have a single solid coloured wall complimented with light coloured paint side walls.

DIY lah since you are just painting to 'cover-up'! 
 
The most you need is five 5 litres of lower grade emulsion and 3 rollers...that will probably cost you less than $170!!...and some sweat and output from your part!

Yes $1300 is really cheap if you are earning more than $1300 in 3 days of 8 hours each less cost of paint, rollers and tapes and some old new papers.
 
Why work for a whole week or so to earn the money to pay someone to work for you for 2 or 3 days at most?

Yes get a cheap paint if you are renting out the house.  Buy a 5 litre can instead of 1 litre X 5.  It's cheaper.  I got matex for about $40 per 5 litre the last time.  Damn bloody heavy to bring the can home.

Painting walls are easy. Painting ceilings is a pain in the neck, literally, especially without the right poles and such.

I always paint my whole house, ceiling and wall,  white.  So the next round of painting is very easy.  Just need to decide whether one coat or two.  If you are repainting a colored wall, the job is more tedious.
 
Please note that if you pay professional, the price should include varnishing the main and room doors and painting whatever that need paint, like the pipes in the toilets etc.

Yes painting is the easiest of all DIY jobs.  But you will be surprised that many can't even do a decent painting.  Painting like any job need practice.
 
Had 2 friends to help in painting a wall with emulsion paint.  The result was no good that I had to repaint it myself.  Had another friend to help paint a door with enamel paint.  Needless to say, end up I repainting the door.
 
Sillyporeans are rich lot that cant DIY.  A young chinese gal returned from US after study can DIY some of her own things including a car.  She said labour is so ex that most must learn to DIY.

since you are selling your house, why save the $800? you are not the one paying for it eventually. just up your selling price by $800. or even 3 x $800 if you like.

No need better paint lah..just go to those 'char long' ( timber yard ) or even common shops that sell building materials and get some white cement. They sell small bags of the cement at about $3.50+ per bag which is quite a lot of powder , I might say.
 
Mix it with just a little more water than usual to make the paste smooth and easy to apply. Then just apply to those area that have cracks before painting.
 
You be amazed how cheap these materials are..it is just the labour that cost sky high here!!

I had just done my interior house painting recently from painting services 

I find that the service is not bad and the price is reasonable.
