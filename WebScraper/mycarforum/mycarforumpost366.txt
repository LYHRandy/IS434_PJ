There are quite a couple of FH condos within 1km of Newton or Novena MRT, branded schools, amenities. 

Also those at the Carnhill area within 1km of Orchard MRT. 

All boils down to how deep your pocket is and how you feel about what you see.

I am looking at those around Hillview circles.
 

Like Glendale Pk Hillview Hts, Hillview Green, Hillview Park etc. All freehold or at least 999 and within 600m radius of new MRT station. I have researched...all quite reasonably priced, esp Hillview park.
 

MRT is due to come on stream by late 2015/early 2015.
 

A new commercial and residential project is taking place soon (but 99 years only).
 

PS: I am not a property agent so dun bother to ask me to look for units. I am staying in the east btw.

Boss,

500m, quite limited. 

I know Newton 1 by the Lippo Group. And there are a couple of developments behind IRAS,and along Scotts road.
 

BTW, I stay at Newton, within 1km of Novena or Newton MRT and surrounded by FH condos..maybe you might drive to Lincoln Rd and have a look. Quite a number of FH condos to choose from (1room to penthouses to lofts...etc)

There is no such thing as a good time to buy.
 

If you can hold, then it is the good time to buy. I take it that you are buying subsale? Buying for investment? And what is your budget?

Also, don't worry too much about freehold vs leasehold.  Leasehold is good enough for 3 generations...

$1.8M u have a lot of choices, but not necessarily near MRT though. FH usually are not so near MRT, unless its a D09/10/11. Near MRT are usually LH..... unless ur pockets are deeper u might hv to give up one of ur criteria

There is this FH condo called BoonView in Bishan. Think around 200-300m away from Marymount MRT.
 

Next to it is the newly constructed Tresalveo..think TOP this year. Also FH.
 

For 1.8m, BoonView or Tresalveo should be affordable to you.

sometimes it is not about the house owner. Maybe the house owner has kids and it is easier for the kids to go school if there is a MRT nearby.
 

Or maybe teh house owners haev a lot of relatives and easy for the relatives to visit them if there is a MRT nearby.
 

Aiya, having a MRT nearby is always better la...doesn't matter got car or not.

Glendale park is 50m and NOT 500m from Hillviw station. 
 

From site gate to entrance of the station is only 50m.

actually should only consider those with MRT stations already constructed and running.
 

You go buy those with MRT nearby but  still constructing one is a big risk. What happen you buy and then later economic downturn and they say they push back the construction of the MRT or maybe ready, but wait a while more before can open? Then really LL.

i am actually interested in the Peak@Balmeg.

its on a hill (though just a small hill), FH and just beside Haw Par Villa mrt.
 

very spacious.....but alas...too expensive

dont know if i should take the plunge and buy it...in hope that it will only appreciate



 




Newton 1 is for the very rich...def not for me.



 

You want FH, you want near MRT, you want max capital appreciation, but you don't want to pay.

How?

Typical kiasu metality.
 

BTW, Newton condos are not for the very rich ... only mediocre (by location and affordability).

Hillview station is confirmed right underneath the traffic junction infront of the standard chartered bank. The nearest 2 condo is Glendale park and hillview hgts. But glendale park beat hillview hgts by about 10m... hehehe
 

If you look at the selling price of projects there such as hillvista and lanai, both selling at more than S$1100 psf and of much more inferior location, I don't understand why glendale park and hillview hgts are only selling at sub S$1000 psf.

ok, i have put it in descending order
 

but propertyguru says it is 540m from Dakota and 670m from Paya Lebar



 

Propertyguru is a bit outdated cos there is a Circle Line there now with a few entrances into the MRT.

Saw the boarded up area by FEOrg.

Seems like a good place to by as it's near to the upcoming hill view MRT station.

Just curious, anyone knows which condos that are Freehold and also situated near a mrt?
Let say less than 1 km.
 
I think these condos will not depreciate even in bad economic time?

 
I did my research on Glendale Park.
 
20 years old freehold
285k sq ft of land
448 units
Each unit owns roughly ard 600 sq ft of real land
 
A glimpse at the recent GLS just beside them which was bought by City Dev at S$1,067 psf ppr for a 99 leasehold land. Means break even for them is ard $1,300 psf
Glendale Park is freehold and currently transacted at ard S$1,150 psf not forgetting its 50m away from HillView DTL from back gate. Much more convenient and valuable than Hiller and or the new City Dev land.
 
Also bigger piece of land with understated livable GFA. 3 tennis courts and many big rectangular shaped grass patches unused
 
All GLS around that area has a 2.8 plot ratio given 
Glendale only has a 1.92 plot ratio.
 
Can we potentially see Glendale plot ratio to be revised to 2.8 for the next Masterplan? Even without the revision of its plot ratio, Glendale Park will still be a deep value purchase for those that holds on to it in the next 10 years. High potential for value unlocking either via enbloc or price apreciation.
 
Hillview DTL is just 7 mins away to Tan Kah Kee(Nanyang Primary, Hwa Chong)
 
The deep value aspect of it is due to the huge price disconnect between the new launches(all 99 years) and the old freehold dev(much nearer to mrt and much more sparse). Glendale is also very well maintained by Knight Frank

In my opinion, the condos could be depreciated. you may get a good price even in the bad economic time.

Yes, why not? Location is very important and if the condo is near MRT the better it is. Being accessible to public transportation is a big factor.

If so many agents can advertise their condos then I want to say I heard got a  very good massage uncle that only do for good looking young ladies. 
 
Can consider. Pm me for name and contact number. 
 
Make appointment early to avoid disappointment.
