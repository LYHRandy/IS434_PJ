My folks thinking about purchasing a landed (F/H) property now (to stay). It's about 980K. Land size 1300 sqft, built up about 1500 sqft. Is it wise for them to get it now? Is the price okay?
 
Thanks.

eh.. land size of 1300sq ft is extremely small...even a condo is bigger than that. 
 
and for that price.. per sq ft doesn't really work out. what's the condition? new or old? renovation needed? 
 
if you ask me, just the location and price already don't work out. and given the small size, I assume if you can squeeze a car in, you would have problem opening the door. 
 
at a built up of 1500, I guess it's double storey with at most 3 rooms. if you have 4 room, then the room shd be very small.
 
 
P.S. a lot of guess work in my post coz you didn't supply much information.

Then price is around there but not many units there. Anyway, I would not pay more than 900K depending on condition and the size is small. Got SCV cable? The roof condition ok? Manhole inside house or outside house? how many stories? near Paya Lebar Methodist Gal school? Try not to get those facing main road. Corner Terrace is the best option.

For that price the TS quoted, the property is in original condition lah!
 
1300sq ft means only very small frontage maybe a Picanto can just drive in but you cannot open the open gate! 
 
Lowest to do major A-A, still must throw in $200K+.
 
Do reconstruction at least $400+ above without piling.
 
Do reconstruction with attic and piling at least $500K+

If you bought it, you would be living pretty close to me . Tai Keng is certainly better than Lorong Ah soo liao. At least Tai Keng not near to HDB and is surrounded with low rise houses, condo and etc. Yes, it is around 900+K around these area.   but 980K for 1500 is little on the high side leh, unless the renovation is fantastic. Mind you hor, inter. terrace is very hot one during hot days, machiam like oven. And you have to share boundaries with left and right neighbours, make sure you're in good term with them . Do you know the last offer price?

There was a unit not far from the one my folks are interested in that was apparently transacted for 950K, and this was in Mar 08. So the owner for this unit is asking for 980K since he renovated it. Agents said 950K can try. According to them, someone had offered 980K but sale did not go through cos loan not approved. But according to another agent selling the unit next to this, the buyer backed out because there were problems with the house   ...don't know who to believe. Anyway, most recent offer, according to the agent, is 940K. What's your take and advice on this? My folks concerned that once they offer higher, prices may start to fall cos of the expected recession...

How does the manhole inside or outside the house impact on the purchaser? I intend to buy a house in OZ, and I would appreciate it if you could enlighten me about what to look out for when buying a house, other than looking at the roof.
 
Manhole in house is very bad feng shui. Very "Ying" (doorway to the other side) and very bad for your finance(sure go broke). It's a feng shui taboo, just like stove cannot face sink like that.
 
btw, which part of OZ you intend to buy?

buying to stay or investment is very different ...
 
for the former, u must like the area, access to amenities and work/school etc ... reno/decor can be changed although with $$$ ...
 
i think if there is no immediate need, make an offer closer to $900K and wait-n-see ... a genuine seller will attempt to nego ... u also have time to look around and compare. It's a buyers' market these days ...
 
but there is no denial that prices have gone up and we shd not expect prices last seen 3-3.5 years ...
 
an example ... single storey inter in Serangoon Gds use to transact between $880 - $1m about 2.5 - 3 yrs ago ... these days, most are asking $1.2m and above ...

Yes, I'm in the process of doing some serious works.
Ripping out 70% of it but keeping structure and extending the backyard etc...
Mine still qualify as A&A after the extension as it is less than 50% extension of land area.  I have already set aside $400k to complete this project which 1+yrs ago would only cost $300k.... !@$^@*#^#%@$^%$  (there goes my Carrera 911)
 
 
As many bros commented already, 1300 sft land with built up 1500sft is considered very small for landed.  Parking a car inside your compound would really be quite tight. but if it suits your family and the environment etc is to your liking, and you are not speculating, i suppose you happy is all that matters.
 
very generally speaking price wise is really more on the highside in your case.
 
I think $700psf for that area is very fair to seller already unless his renovation is tip top type.
 
a year ago it would be no more than $500psf, so you cna do the calculations easily.

There was a unit not far from the one my folks are interested in that was apparently transacted for 950K, and this was in Mar 08. So the owner for this unit is asking for 980K since he renovated it. Agents said 950K can try. According to them, someone had offered 980K but sale did not go through cos loan not approved. But according to another agent selling the unit next to this, the buyer backed out because there were problems with the house   ...don't know who to believe. Anyway, most recent offer, according to the agent, is 940K. What's your take and advice on this? My folks concerned that once they offer higher, prices may start to fall cos of the expected recession...
 
1. If you asked me, renovation only make it easier to sell, it can't really fetch good money. If the last price is 940K, why should you be paying more? If you have surplus cash, you can try to pay them more cash up front beside the 1% to sweeten the deal a bit. 
 
2. Don't foregt if you pay 980K now, you must see for yourself how much up side you can hit if you're going to sell the next moment? (If this house at this place is not gpoing to hit more than $1M in a few years time then this place is a place to live only but no speculation.)If down side, how much you're going to lose and whether you have enough holding power (if need to sell, how much you can loose if say selling at 850K). I advise this, because if one is holding a few properties so must make sure have sufficent holding power in a downside situation.
 
3. To cut it short, if you are not speculating or waiting for enbloc, you can consider. but I still think 940K is high for me for the size but if you really like the environment and renovations, then its your choice, your money.

Manhole in house is very bad feng shui. Very "Ying" (doorway to the other side) and very bad for your finance(sure go broke). It's a feng shui taboo, just like stove cannot face sink like that.  
btw, which part of OZ you intend to buy?

 
They are houses with manhole right at the centre of the kitchen. Imagine, if for some reasons it choked, apart from the smell, the repair cost may be high depending on how bad is the problem. Yap, manhole within kitchen is bad feng shui. a creative way to conceal/diguise it, is to lay tiles to cover the manhole cover so that it looks as if like part of the floor.

eh.. land size of 1300sq ft is extremely small...even a condo is bigger than that.  
and for that price.. per sq ft doesn't really work out. what's the condition? new or old? renovation needed? 
 
if you ask me, just the location and price already don't work out. and given the small size, I assume if you can squeeze a car in, you would have problem opening the door. 
 
at a built up of 1500, I guess it's double storey with at most 3 rooms. if you have 4 room, then the room shd be very small.
 
 
P.S. a lot of guess work in my post coz you didn't supply much information.

 
Reminds me alot of some of those tiny toilet cubicles that are so tiny that u need to step over the toilet bowl so that the door can be closed

buying to stay or investment is very different ... 
for the former, u must like the area, access to amenities and work/school etc ... reno/decor can be changed although with $$$ ...
 
i think if there is no immediate need, make an offer closer to $900K and wait-n-see ... a genuine seller will attempt to nego ... u also have time to look around and compare. It's a buyers' market these days ...
 
but there is no denial that prices have gone up and we shd not expect prices last seen 3-3.5 years ...
 
an example ... single storey inter in Serangoon Gds use to transact between $880 - $1m about 2.5 - 3 yrs ago ... these days, most are asking $1.2m and above ...

 
Thank you for your sound advice bro

Yes, I'm in the process of doing some serious works.Ripping out 70% of it but keeping structure and extending the backyard etc...
Mine still qualify as A&A after the extension as it is less than 50% extension of land area.  I have already set aside $400k to complete this project which 1+yrs ago would only cost $300k.... !@$^@*#^#%@$^%$  (there goes my Carrera 911)
 
 
As many bros commented already, 1300 sft land with built up 1500sft is considered very small for landed.  Parking a car inside your compound would really be quite tight. but if it suits your family and the environment etc is to your liking, and you are not speculating, i suppose you happy is all that matters.
 
very generally speaking price wise is really more on the highside in your case.

Not a good time - particularly citing the asking price for your kinda location.
 
There's a slight chance property prices could fall. It's already in the midst of a slowdown from last year's rocketing prices. It may come down if there's widespread recession. But that's a big IF.
 
Even if recession doesn't come our way, property prices are unlikely to go up further. In fact they may come a little lower - particularly for that 980grand asking price for the place ur parents are looking at. A little too optimistic on the seller's part I believe.
 
Drop around 50grand then maybe... Just maybe. Then perhaps also wishful thinking on my part. Haha. Anyway, don't buy tiny terrace la. It's really not a good idea.

Not that well to do still buy overpriced landed property? 
 
Your parents, or perhaps you, should start making better calculations and analysis of your family's cashflows and the prevailing property and economic situation relative to income.
 
From the details you've provided, I don't think your parents have thought this carefully enough. They must be patient. 
 
Don't let the property agent rush you guys with the usual "many-people-want-this-place" or other kinda tactics. Esp in the current property market. Slow down. Don't be rash. Good luck! :)

It's a game of Poker always.
The only way to "win" is not to bluff but to make sure that you can afford to lose.
 
All I can tell you, having surveyed the market at its peak (Jun 07 to Jan 08)
is that the price is not right.  
 
Stand your ground.  
Dont forget you still need to pay stamp duties.

I tend to agree with Throttle2.
Put your offer on the table and prepare to walk away if offer not accepted.
If the seller is keen, they will negotiate further.
If you really really like the place, maybe up your offer a bit (to show sincerity in closing the deal).
Like someone said earlier, this is not the only house in Singapore.

It's a game of Poker always.
The only way to "win" is not to bluff but to make sure that you can afford to lose.
 
All I can tell you, having surveyed the market at its peak (Jun 07 to Jan 08)
is that the price is not right.  
 
Stand your ground.  
Dont forget you still need to pay stamp duties.
That is not the only house in Singapore.
PLenty to go around...hoho..

The agent say got people offer lah...ask me hurry also...haiz..

 
Agent always say so one lah. You tell him if people offer higher price then good for him/her cos got more commission lor. I usually tell these people to fark off. They treat you like a fool so you do the same to them 
 
this i beg to diff... an smart agent wont do it this way, u see, if the price were to 980K, agent commission say 2%, that's $19600, if the agent close the deal at 940K, the commission will be $18800 the difference is only $800, i dont think the agent will be stoooopig enough to forgo $18800 juz becos of $800. what if he get less than 2%? the different is even smaller... perhaps in this case, the agent do have an offer but is lower than 940K, so after much persuation, they can reach say 960K and then close the deal. 
 
Then again, given the current mkt any offer sup liao. Where will wait for higher offer since the comm only diff by $800.  
 
What i see is bro Milgram is a direct buyer to the agent while the earlier offer that the seller agent got was a cobroke case so comm is split 1/2. This agent sure will call Milgram and test water. 
 
You quite smart bro...found out that that's what is happening

 It happened that i train ppl like them. 
 
But what this seller agent did was not ethical lah. He's placing his own gains above the owner's which usually ppl like them will not go far in their career.

It's the agent again.
you so hard up, anyone can tell that form a mile away.
raise the price a bit , scare scare you and you will relent.
you are such an easy target, bro.
 
It's up to you if you want to be a sucker then.
If the owner truly raise it to $1mil, it means he is not genuine.
1300sft asking for $1mil in that area?
You can get 1600sft for $1mil easily, dude.
Just go do some homework.  dont be so hard up.
 
Tell the agent to stuff it and leave your offer at $900k or nothing.
Write him a check for $9000 to show that you are serious.

I have bot and sold my own property before.
 
When I put a price up for sale , I dont adjust it higher when a genuine buyer makes me an offer.  Such an action only angers the buyer.  Pride plays a larger part then most people think when it comes to buying and selling properties.
 
My way is to tell the agent to bring the owner along and meet face to face.  make your fair offer.  if nothing done then forget it.  no hard feelings.
 
The problem is the agent is the one always playing tricks.
 
Maybe you can arrange to meet owner to assess sincerity.
But do not turn it into a bargaining event or worse still arguing about price.
Be professional and fair.  if he is truly asking for the sky, just look somewhere else.

Yes, I'm in the process of doing some serious works.Ripping out 70% of it but keeping structure and extending the backyard etc...
Mine still qualify as A&A after the extension as it is less than 50% extension of land area.  I have already set aside $400k to complete this project which 1+yrs ago would only cost $300k.... !@$^@*#^#%@$^%$  (there goes my Carrera 911)

 
Hi
 
What is the process you went through to do reno ?
 
My mom's place is 30+ years already. Roof is not looking too good.. In addition to other things.
 
Want to look into the cost of doing major reno for her but dunno where/how to start...  Did you look for architect 1st ?  Contractor ???  I don't think contractor can handle design and A&A plus other stuff right ?
 
Need Architect + Engineer input if tearing down walls ?
 
We hope to do the following :
 
 - Extension to add additional rooms
 - Redo Roof
 - Re-wire + Plumbing ?
 - New floors + Doors + Windows
 
Shucks... Looks like everything man....
 
I only used a contractor to settle all the renovations for my own appt last time so very green here...
 
Any input is appreciated
 
Thanks.

You can get a turnkey contractor to do everything. That means the design and implementation will be handed by him but the brief is set by you.

Really depends on what you want to do. But yours seem like the works.
 
Sometimes it may be cheaper to do stage by stage if time/convenience is on your side.
Otherwise your mum must move out for at least 6 mths and let them do all the work before moving back.
 
If you do electrical rewiring and plumbing, you'll have to hack up everything and then tile back which means floors and walls will go.
Extension to add rooms will require new footing to hold the weight and also repositiong of existing footing if in the way.
 
your first step is to acquire the architect and structural plans from BCA.
then you can go directly to Professional Engineers to discuss the feasibility of what you want to do.  at the same time get idea of the possible costs involve through builders.  If you really need, I can link you up with people i know.

Tongue in cheek - how many living mortals can afford landed property in Spore?
 
In the afterlife, landed property locations are limited to Lim Chu Kang and the far outskirts. Don't think the govt will revive Orchard with landed property in Basement 18.
 
By the way, certain stretches of Orchard Rd used to be grave yards, eg. The plot of land where Tangs sits on.

Today Sunday, i very free so look at propertyguru website for landed houses.
 
Not that i can afford since i am poor and now jobless but so as to up my ego.
 
Anyway I notice one property being advertised by several agents.
Four agents advertise $5mil and one agent advertise $5.5mil
They are from different companies.
 
What does this show?
 That there are still agents out there with the most sincere intention to screw buyers.
Imagine, the rest of the agents already posted $5mil, and this a**hole still dare to post $5.5mil.
Obviously out to cheat Buyers.
 
Therefore Buyers (if there are any) plse open you eyes, do your homework, deal with the right person.

Agree that buyers need to do their due diligence but it's unfair to assume the agent is out to cut throat by just comparing the ads.
 
As a real estate agent, I have met newbie agent who readily accept seller's price at face value e.g. $5.5m compared to experienced agent who is able to lower seller's expectation to $5m. There are many possible reasons behind the discrepancy but not necessarily of malicious intent.

Usually, the unethical agents are the ones who advertised below seller's expectation in order to attract buyers to call them.

Today Sunday, i very free so look at propertyguru website for landed houses.
 
Not that i can afford since i am poor and now jobless but so as to up my ego.
 
Anyway I notice one property being advertised by several agents.
Four agents advertise $5mil and one agent advertise $5.5mil
They are from different companies.
 
What does this show?
 That there are still agents out there with the most sincere intention to screw buyers.
Imagine, the rest of the agents already posted $5mil, and this a**hole still dare to post $5.5mil.
Obviously out to cheat Buyers.
 
Therefore Buyers (if there are any) plse open you eyes, do your homework, deal with the right person.
You have made it obvious that you really not in the market for quite awhile. 
This kind of thing really is common since long ago, even for exclusive deals. If multiple adverts by various agents, sure got few with higher indicative prices.

I have met many agent who do tell me my price target is reasonable for my 15 year old landed. They will market based on a higher value.
 
One is to suss out the buyer profile.
 
Some buyer really CMI. Buy landed but need to ask 2 other family to sell HDB and combined to buy the house. Buy want you to hold on the house and provided refund if the deal do not go thru because the money from their HDB / jumbo not sold yet.
 
Some buyer have car issue, one family 4 cars so they want to move out of condo just to park 4 cars.
 
Some if you can term it kampong sprit, I term it kampong village, will check out how to create more rooms from the roof terrace .. This one I really shake head..
 
Some go to the extend to see what kind of neighbor you have and want to meet them. This type, I feel is more genuine buyer who has the intend to move in and stay.
 
Other is just pure speculative who wants to buy low and sell when the market picks up. So no matter what price you give, they will low ball you but act as if your house is the worst they have seen

Just buy one with one's affordability...
If you able to afford without disrupting much of your lifestyle, why not?
 
But do remember, it will only be a real house if you fill it up with family love ....
else, it just a house made with 4 walls of bricks and a roof ...

The real challenge is really in the definition of what it means by "affordable". How does one really gauge whether a property is within his affordability radar? Is it based on the purchase quantum, the downpayment, the monthly installments or some other factor?

I once asked this myself . . .
 
ok..... I assume everyone here requires a home loan for your purchase, yeah?
so, whatever quantum, downpayment, bla bla bla..... it all boils down to how much you can loan . . .
and the loan amount results how much you can afford in your monthly instalments!
 
well, to each his own . . .  all I can say if you wanna squeeze yourself real tight, you can max out from the current TDSR with your banker that is applicable to you (by law, nothing more your can squeeze liao) . . .
 
for example;
a. TDSR applies to 60% of your income; you should NOT have any other o/s misc loans . . . cards, clubs, cars etc.
b. Bank applicators for another 10-20%; how much spares you have to 'tie-in' with your bank (put up a fixed deposit sum as loan quantum guarrentee eg.)
so, from a. & b...... you can max out to 80% of your monthly income onto your property asset.
 
bare this in mind that if there's further unaccounted 'burdens' or 'others' that may be surprises that hit you - you are screwed!
such 'others' can be the recent hikes in bank interest . . .
such 'burdens' can be your family's healthcare or wellbeings & needs . . .  etc.
 
oh! dun forget that you can still go for home renovation loans that are NOT tied with abovementioned . . .
and landed home reno will not be lower than $100k!
 
of coz, all above are applicable to you provided with a good, clean, credibility meeting with your bank loan criterion.
 
any thoughts?

Nothing against you firstly. 
 
But agents like car dealers are sama sama lah.
When you selling they say scrap value plus body
When you buying they say market value not scrap value
 
For property
When you selling, agents will tell you how bad and tough the market is now
When you buying they say it is going up and always will be
 
The trick is simple,  lower seller expectations of price and increase buyer expectation of price
Then in the middle big big gap makes it easy for agent to close the deal
 
Come on even bloody investment bankers do that

the best agent(s) should be the one that can relate to you the geniune or most current market driven rate (NOT the valuation for recent surveyor!!!), and able to convey the real value to both Buyer and of coz the Seller !!!
in sellers' view, they'd (of coz) cook up whatsoever best reasons to clinch onto the highest price (not even any calling prices!!!).
example.... if next door's unit just sold at 3mil, the seller might insisted on 3.5mil just bcoz he feels that his unit or decor is better,,,,,,
but the agent MUST know how to relate with his 'potential' buyers or even the seller on:
- the current trends; going up or down
- historical deals; be careful of the geniunity and 'stories' behind past deals ***
 
*** : landed property can be a very dominating market......
- some sellers (owned more than one unit in that area) will purposely transact at higher price with rents or sales among his accomplice just to 'jack-up' the value in that vicinity!
- past transactions may NOT tell the truth if you dun find out what's the "story" behind that deal !!!
 
agents will scrutinise seller's financial state if he/she is desperate to sell or wanna hang-on for higher price
bad agents will 'pretend' to act in accordance to sellers' price tag; knowingly that such deal is impossible..... until the unit become 'cold turkey' or seller's impatience prior marketing it at the market price.
 
similarly, buyer should know what the unit's value should be and its heading value, eg. if property valuation at 3mil and market is heading downward, then buyer should set a prestige (base on likings) to be lowered . . . .
 
I have seen some landed units that I was once very keen and even issued cheques to sellers but were rejected (2014 & 2013). 
recently, I could still receive agents calls from these units' if I'm still keen on the same price???
you see . . . .
 
if you are really keen in hunting for your landed property, dun just leave everything to your representing agents!
you must really do your homework etc. . . . and 'test' your agents if he's being truthful.
most of all, you will see if the agents are leaning towards a genuinity deals regardless towards buyer or seller!!!

Agree with you that managing expectation is a common technique used by agents, dealers and even politicians. Whilst there are bad apples out there, there are good apples too. No need to be so cynical lah :)

My definition of affordability:
1) You must be able to afford the downpayment e.g. 20%.
2) Obtain HLE from HDB or speak to banker to find out how much you're eligible to loan.
3) A rule of thumb is no more than 30% of your monthly income on housing instalment. This is based on the the MSR (Mortgage Servicing Ratio) which is more prudent than TDSR (Total Debt Servicing Ratio) of 60%.
4) Calculate the instalment based on higher interest rate e.g. 3.5% and see if it's still manageable.
 
Other factors to consider is personal commitment. For example, 2 families, both household income of $10k. One of them have a car, 3 kids, and aging parents to take care of. The other have no kids, no car and parents are overseas. Naturally, the 2nd family would be able to afford a property more comfortably despite having the same household income. That's where the first family may have difficulty with the instalment should interest rates go up by another 1-2%.

It is great to hear views on the definition of affordability. In my opinion there is no absolute right or wrong view. Everything is relative and subjective.
 
Nevertheless, for the purpose of discussion, my definition of affordability is the ability of the property-buyer to pay for the property fully in cash (if this sounds familiar, it probably reeks heavily of Throttlism). This is my view of true affordability. Anything else is simply taking bets on certain factors not turning against the borrower.
 
When it becomes a fact that the majority of home-owners in a country can no longer pay for the property that they are residing in hard cash, then it points to two things:
 
a. the formation of a bubble in the property market whose inevitable collapse is being postponed by artificial mechanisms that allow kicking the can down the road; it is not a matter of if the bubble bursts but when
 
b. the weakening of fundamentals in the economics and management of the country such that successive generations of home-owners are becoming more and more entrenched in excessive debt taken to obtain a roof over their heads
 
Both of these culminate in the catastrophic outcomes that we have seen happen in countries such as Iceland and Japan where home-owners laden with debt get thrown into the deep end with negative equity when their countries' property markets imploded.

errr . . . TS title is ' . . . to buy landed property . . '
i'd certainly assume that it will be utterly 'not right' for one to transact in real hard cash.... we are talking multi-millions deal here.
and engaging for loans for a much bigger quantum is almost for most buyers, simply bcoz our country landed assets have far been 'ballooned' into today's price. coupled with strict legislative in landed acquisitions (only for locals), the 'affordability' might easily become 'non-available' . . . 
(if anyone here have million in hard cash,, then he's wasting his time here in this forum; he should be spending time to stretch that million into billions instead . . . )
 
I'd say..... instead of putting all your $ into investments; the so-called let your $ works for you - its still an instinct in 'gambling' with the recent volatile markets.  but what have you enjoyed in your life (& your family's). this includes all those whom had invested in private properties such as condomiums.......
 
but a landed property in this country could be the only appreciation assets left for your retirements or hopefully an inheritage to your decendents (here's a cosmopolitan city floating on world finance platform.....less there's war!)
 
actually, to answer this thread is very very simple.
your 'affordability' today will depreciate according to your age too!!!  longer loan means lesser instalments, right?
but when you reach your 'affordability', you might loose the price of 'yester years' as well as your credibility for longer loans!
dun bother about market up or down; landed assets here are in millions, thus the delta is minor compared to the quantum......
 
honestly, I'd have saved more by securing my landed property much much earlier rather than waited for my 'affordability'.......
sigh!

Since we are on topic of affordability and age, here are some numbers to ponder over.
 
Property price: $5,000,000
20% downpayment: $1,000,000
3% Stamp duty: $144,600 (assume first property)
Interest rate: 3.5% (as per MAS guideline)
 
To obtain a loan of $4,000,000, one needs to have a min monthly income of:
- $30,000 per month for a 35-year old
- $33,375 per month for a 40-year old
- $38,663 per month for a 45-year old
- $47,658 per month for a 50-year old

At >$10M range, most of the buyers could be funding the purchase using profits from their businesses, past properties etc rather than their income.
 
For example, a GCB in Queen Astrid Park was recently sold at $32M. Barely 10 years ago, it was transacted for $12.5M in 2006. That's why they say the rich gets richer. Back in 2006 I can't even afford the 3% stamp duty :)

To clarify my point on being able to pay for a property in cold hard cash: a property owner can have the ability to fully pay for the house but chooses to take on a loan so that he can invest that cash and earn from any arbitrage between his investment rates of return and the loan interest rates. 
 
This is different from the case where the individual does not have the means to fully pay off the property cost but uses a loan to cover the gap. 
 
I am not saying that doing things the second way is horrendously wrong. In fact, for many people, this is one good way of exploiting the growth of the country in which the property is based.
 
Investing in property in any country is tantamount to investing in the growth of that country. If the country continues to flourish, the properties in that country (barring any control by the government e.g. Germany) will increase in market value.
 
In short, what I am trying to say is that the second approach consists of a speculative component which then requires careful analysis of many other factors including the timing of the purchase.

To clarify my point on being able to pay for a property in cold hard cash: a property owner can have the ability to fully pay for the house but chooses to take on a loan so that he can invest that cash and earn from any arbitrage between his investment rates of return and the loan interest rates. 
 
This is different from the case where the individual does not have the means to fully pay off the property cost but uses a loan to cover the gap. 
 
I am not saying that doing things the second way is horrendously wrong. In fact, for many people, this is one good way of exploiting the growth of the country in which the property is based.
 
Investing in property in any country is tantamount to investing in the growth of that country. If the country continues to flourish, the properties in that country (barring any control by the government e.g. Germany) will increase in market value.
 
In short, what I am trying to say is that the second approach consists of a speculative component which then requires careful analysis of many other factors including the timing of the purchase.
 
 
 

I agree.
 
It is this same attitude i take towards buying cars and watches etc.....
Some times people misunderstand what i hv been saying and since i hv explained so many times already, i just let it be.  
 
Am glad you belong to the same "club" as me

Is it a good time to buy a landed property to stay now?
 
Any time you can afford to buy a landed property 
 
is a good time. I am waiting for that time to come
 
but I think I have to wait a really long time.

My folks thinking about purchasing a landed (F/H) property now (to stay). It's about 980K. Land size 1300 sqft, built up about 1500 sqft. Is it wise for them to get it now? Is the price okay?
 
Thanks.

I think it really depends on what the cause is likely to be.
 
Singapore is like "swiss cheese" looks good on the outside but underneath very very "hole-ly". I believe land slippage is likely a multitude of causes and very very likely the nearby digging by SMRT will be a one of the main causes. However, if the cause is a result of the owner putting unauthorised pool onto a weakened structure then it is completely different story. They were once good neighbours but now his neighbour can sue him for weakening the structure. If it is indeed authorised, then the owner can sue the civil engineer or the architect who authorised it!

Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha 
Jalan Belangkas? Jalan Melor?
 
Got a colonial style oldie there I would love to get.
 
There is also a semi detached (exterior looks like dilapidated 'hantu' house). A beagle lives there. Yum yum.
 
Besides buying the property, need to get civil engineer / architect / electrician / plumber to check out condition. I would rather keep the original facade. Make my childhood dreams come true.

Why so many people want to stay in landed property.. not nice de. I stay before terrace, corner terrace, semi D, cluster house, all 3 floors at least.
 
1. So big & waste of space.
2. Need to maintain this and that all yourself, not the costs of maintenance but rather the frustration and micromanagement.
3. If not well managed, the family becomes v dissected because older people stopped going upper floors, younger ones just stay in their rooms.
4. Internet connection is a hassle.. esp if fibre point is 1st floor and your router is 3rd floor + home plug not stable.
5. Garden.. I'm not a green person, not keen on this. But the pests.. giant grasshoppers, lizards, snakes, bees.. neighbours cats, sometimes monkey.
 
Just my 2 cents.

For people who have never stayed in a landed, it is an aspiration, a sign that you have made it.
 
And you forgot the heat (difficult to aircon the whole place).  I find item 3 the biggest drawback, so max is 2 storey, but may be good for large extended family (I would think better to buy 2 condo units side by side).  I hate it but my dad likes it.

Heat wise.. it's alright. My gf's HDB.. the walls are warm in the evening. My landed property don't have such problem. When we on air con.. it cools down faster than my gf's place as well.. maybe that one is air con problem, not very sure.
 
But small family.. stay landed property really wasteful and not efficient. 
 
I have some friends.. all wanna stay landed, like you say, aspirations lor. To let others know they have arrived. Sometimes I wonder.. they wanna stay landed is for their own sake or is for others to see and look up to.. lol  
 
I can't wait to move out when my condo is ready.

1. Big and spacious, wont feel like a mouse2. Use quality fitting, little maintenance.
3. No older people, oldest is me
4. Internet is on 4g unlimited
5. Garden and swimming pool for cigar parties, just dont have a fruit tree, lush plants and frangipani is ok
6. Can park a 911, Sclass and Vezel, plus 2 harleys, a ducati, a Cb1100 and a Z1000.
7. Roof terrace provides good view and breeze for weekend BBQs and lounging
 
Just my 50cts
 
Condo is good for facilities and convenience.
So very easy, have both. Like me last time weekday stay landed, weekend stay condo in D9.
 
Actually, i stay HDB, plse ignore above.

With aircon, every house/flat is cool but it cost a lot more to cool down a landed house (larger and high ceiling), not for middle class folks like me. My friend switches on his aircon 24/7, his bills is 4-digit every month.   
Anyway, this is becoming like a haolian thread....  But anyone aspiring to stay in a landed should know there is a trade off, especially when it comes to relationship within the family.  The heat and staircase keep everyone in their rooms longer than in the common area, so less face time with kids and loved ones.  Best is buy/built a single storey landed with 4-bedroom, put in a pool and gym with lots of green but I money not enough.

The problem is when we say "landed", the concept in everyone's mind is different, the costs are different, and thus the possibilities and experiences are very different.
 
When I mentioned "private property" to T2, I meant entry level to entry level plus below 1 mil to 1.5 mil, but his understanding was Cluny Park and 6th Avenue gigantic condo onwards and definitely in D9.
 
We can never agree on the same conclusions. I suggest clearer definitions (terrace, semi-D, bungalow, monthly income of 6K, 10K, 30K, 300K etc) when we further the discussion to make it more meaningful for readers.

The only good takeaway I can see from here is for people to share their first-hand experience in owning one, such as hidden costs and recurring costs and maintenance costs, etc, etc., so that those who aspire can benefit and make informed decision if owning one is within reach or really desirable.
 
Space - if can afford big plot of land of course is good. Can build garden or pool to relax. Best would be those 4-storey rebuilt type.
 
With young kids - actually condo is more desirable as got more space for kids to roam around safely, not to mention with facilities like swimming pool and kids room in club house. The kids can also pick up social skills interacting with other kids in the neighbourhood. Easier to bond with classmates by having them over for a swimming session if stay nearby.
 
Electricity bills - my personal experience with aircon running 10hrs daily for 3 rooms and about 9 in the household and much water wasted watering the plants in the house, come to about $500 monthly. Not very ex. Converting all lights to LED type would help.
 
Quality fixtures - this highlighted by Throttle2 I fully agree. When my house was renovated 5 years ago, I installed both Grohe and other non-brand type of tap and shower system. The formal still look new while the later already got some fading, undergoing roughly same use. So worth it to pay more for the quality.  
 
Hidden costs - need to set aside some money to repaint the house every 5 years or 10 years, so that it would not look rundown, Same for roof about every 20 years, unless is those rebuilt flat type which I am not sure is more prone to leaking as advised by some contractors. Also for auto-gate motor which need replacement every few years costing a k or 2.
 
I am definitely trying to haolian here, just sharing some insight.  I hope all don't be so serious, just have some fun posting lah.​

Ok i be serious now. 
 
You dont like landed because you havent quite grown up yet.
And you havent exactly made your money either.
At most in your early thirties and still living with your parents, grandparents, uncle/aunties.
You are dying for a space of your own so a small simple condo is currently your dream at the moment.
 
Its ok, i was like that 15yrs ago.
Started out with a 1800sft bachelors pad and another studio loft in D9.
I never ever thought of buying landed as a late 20something to early 30something.
Its a youngster, wannabe hip thing lah.
I understand, i was young and stupid too. (Lucky not too stupid)
 
You'll grow up.
 
Yes.

Some cluster house has decent size too
 
But not much cluster house with freehold title. 
 
Anyway if i am rich, i wont buy big house. I just need a house to fit my small family, enough rooms and some space. 
 
a condo with size 1300-1500 sqft is good enough

If I ever buy a private, it's gonna be a landed and not a condo 
 
Nowadays the condo is smaller than HDB, and I don't see what's the difference between a pool and gym facilities, my friend told me a condo is worth it because there's savings on gym and club membership but I think the condo even the big ones is still too small to house my things 
 
I would enjoy a garden and private space of my own 
 
I m sure my doggie will like it too 
 
But I can only dream for now, better save more $$$ for retirement than to be in debt for couple of years 
 
If I strike toto first prize sole winner, I will for sure buy a landed somewhere

Again go back to purpose of buying. No strong reason, better to stay put.
 
There are old and huge condos as well. The balconies of some can build gardens and host kennels. But that is not necessary for just as many people as well.
 
Hedging and hoarding of land in anticipation of land appreciation, of course landed better. Privacy (security), rental yields, rental and liquidity purposes, side bets etc, condos better.
 
Tailormaking to desire, only landed can do, and even cluster landed can't modify much. But the funds just to rebuild are usually enough to buy a small new condo. In the past, there are those who rebuild old landed and resell for profits. Now the strategy is not likely to be profitable.
 
Gym and club membership for one person seldom reaches condo monthly maintenance of $300-400, but for a family of 4-5, the worthiness emerges.
 
There is no single best answer for this. It depends on one's needs, what you value and your personal circumstances.

Practically speaking old liao, retire in condo is more convenient than landed.
 
imagine your knees chui liao, u can't even climb up to the 2nd floor of your house.
Many terraces also have the 2-3 steps up into the deeper part of the house on the first floor.
Imagine if you have someone with wheelchair in the house. All these need to pay a lot of $ to fix.

Some cluster house has decent size too
 
But not much cluster house with freehold title.
 
Anyway if i am rich, i wont buy big house. I just need a house to fit my small family, enough rooms and some space.
 
a condo with size 1300-1500 sqft is good enough 

KNS.... "if I am rich"...

if can afford a landed prop, then try not to buy cluster
why? . . . 
you must be on the waiting list in order for the facilities etc.  and you have no say on the management decision
someone knocking on your doors coz its times' up for theirs . . .
you cannot suka suka book & cancel your bookings of the facilities etc.....
 
 those stayed in central management facility (condos etc.) will understand

Practically speaking old liao, retire in condo is more convenient than landed.
 
imagine your knees chui liao, u can't even climb up to the 2nd floor of your house.
Many terraces also have the 2-3 steps up into the deeper part of the house on the first floor.
Imagine if you have someone with wheelchair in the house. All these need to pay a lot of $ to fix.

Yah if having disabled family member really inconvenient

Hmm...nowadays a lift is a standard feature for new or rebuilt landed already. And not too ex to install and upkeep, from what I know.

Hmm...nowadays a lift is a standard feature for new or rebuilt landed already. And not too ex to install and upkeep, from what I know.
 
Considering the total costs of rebuilding of $800k to $1.5m, setting aside $60k (excluding installation which can add another $30-40k) to include the lift is a no-brainer.  Just need to set aside a monthly service fee of around $200.  And the lift is no ordinary taiwanese or China no-name brand but Schindler which I have seen it being used at the cluster project Palms @ 6th Ave.  But honestly,
 
As for a pool, its really just a lifestyle feature.  Unless you have a land size of 4,000 sqf and above, any pool is really just a long bath.  Being small, it also mean it wouldn't cost a lot to build.  As an example, I spent around $100k to put a really small 10m x 2.5m pool despite knowing I'm not going to use it much but since already spend so much on the building cost, might as well just put it in.  If want to rent out to ang-mo, tell you, they loved it to nuts and will happily pay extra $2k /month rental for the pool.  I know coz my angmo colleague just rented a place and paid the extra for the pool.

One feature about some cluster terraces available nowadays is that they tend to have one long staircase at the side of the house as opposed to the traditional 2 flight of stairs up to the 2nd floor.
 
I feel it's really dangerous, u fall from the 2nd floor down the staircase really can die one cos it's just one way route down to the 1st floor. especially since the floors are higher than compared to HDB/condo.

OK let me stir the pot for a more fruitful discussion. My main point is buying property is very much based on a person (and family) situation. Each has its pros and cons. No right or wrong or even best answer.
 
Supposing an average family (2 adults and 2 kids) with a 3 million budget to buy properties. Which of the following combination makes the most sense, provided all options are available to the family? Explain your choice.
 
1. All on one landed property, the max size and best location / type they can find.
 
2. Two of 1.5 million properties (say maybe one landed and one condo). Aiming to rent out one.
 
3. Three properties on average costing 1 million each, likely only private condos. Aiming to rent out two.
 
4. Just get the minimal property (size and location) the family requires (maybe HDB or EC) and invest the rest of the sum in other non-properties instruments.

can only consider all options if got $3M cash leh ... haven't taken ABSD into account yet
if only $1M cash ... how? TDSR also blow liao to get 2nd property not to mention 60% downpayment for 2nd property
if one got $3M cash to shop for property means one should have at least close to $5M in the bank ...
so one "thinking" would be very different from "normal" people thinking
sorry to digress ...

Bro, I use that scenario to depict the case for a cousin of mine. Cash out from one popular HDB already 1 million in the bank plus what he accumulated in CPF and cash over the years, total about 1.5mil. His age and income together with his wife qualifies to buy around $3 million property in total.
 
Realistic sum and achievable by MCF standards.

Yes he was very lucky to get a large 5 rm too. Amongst the first to book before they increased the prices greatly. 
But supposing 3 mil really feels too high, can consider as 2 mil as well. Modify the option combinations.

If your cousin has not yet committed to any purchase, it will be more prudent for him to keep his powder dry. He will be able to get more mileage out of his $1.5m cash/CPF if he is patient.
 
The technicals and fundamentals point to a bigger stock market rout in the coming days. It may be easy to get lulled into a false sense of safety with the recent rally but a rally remains just that - a rally - in a bear market.
 
The downtrend is intact and look out for the last straw that will break the camel's back.

He needs a place to stay soon though. 
He has been burnt substantially before by stocks so unlikely to put huge sums into it. Definitely not into millions.

do you know there's stamp duty and ABSD for buying properties?
your choices 1, 2, 3 & 4 will depend on how much this buyer wants to donate to the gahmen
#1 - 300k
#2 - 190K +150k, ie. 340k
#3 - 97k + 124k + 124k - 344k
#4 - buying a shoebox size apartment might as well rent one while dump the rest into investments or properties else way?
 
y. see...... after deduction from above, plus minor reno & cosmetic that easily hit 250k for a landed, and with misc fees with 50k
#1, a budget of 3m may just left with 2.4m
#2, there's no way for any landed available for this option
#3, this is only possible with shoebox size condos at faraway locations
 
so y' see . . . . 3m is nothing big at all here!

Of course there are other areas they also managed well, such as settled auto loan with income close to the max allowed for new ECs.
 
For full cash options there is only option 4. Just get a 1-1.5mil property unless they opt for an old terrace. Which brings me back to my earlier post. Landed option is not for all, depending on one's objective in life.
 
But I do know of other relatives who are taking option 1 (I think more than 3 mil but I don't know how much), but the difference is they have a parent who is a business owner that brings their cash into millions after selling their HDB in the outskirt. Parents to take care of their child in their landed property.
 
Sorry, my family and my spouse family lines are very prolific then, so I have lots of relatives for juicy stories to learn from

Think about 2 weeks ago, the money matters in Sunday Times published a article on this kind of scenario - is it better to buy a condo, or buy 2 and let out one with same money. Part CPF, part cash.
 
The financial considerations panned out that the later method result in positive monthly outlay while the former is negative, meaning the owner would need to pump in cash every month to maintain the loan. I was very surprise with the difference, really important to do some homework and run through the figures instead of just based on hunches or general opinions.

Assuming you are still young and if older have other sources of retirement income,  I would go for Option 1. Landed properties (FREEHOLD) price appreciation will outpace any condo out there in the long term due to its very limited supply. Can downgrade whenever necessary and buy 3-4 condos for retirement income if all your money is locked up in that sole landed property.

My thoughts are, with the TDSR framework permanently in place, it is a little gamble about how the outpacing can actually take place. My those few relatives are amongst the most capable and highly paid employees I have. Any higher, it will have to be the self-employed / CEO with stacks of cash and suitcases to put on table. Or developers to buy over. Nonetheless, it's also a possible strategy, but not for everyone.
 
Also, continually moving might not be well appreciated by family members, especially if that is the only property.
 
Option 2 or even 3 are my preferences with that kind of money. Faster, easier to buy and sell etc. If fall sick need the money, can sell 1 without moving (might be gain or loss depending on market) but should get back some money. But that's just my two cents.

you think our gahmen is that stupid for couple (married) with same address to escape stamp duties or compound ABSD for owning multiple properties? will MAS approve the bank loans with couple's joint names?
lol, you are sure with that?  you spoken to any law firm that facilitates that?
well, less they are that cash rich, not implicated by TDSR or even does not require any loan . . . .

It's nothing to do with cash rich or not.
 
Option 3 no matter how creatively arranged cannot escape ABSD, even if fully pay for all in cash.
 
Option 2 means each member takes up the loan in their own name only. Sole owner. It's been discussed on newspaper, several people I know have already done it. No ABSD, no legal conflict at the moment. 
 
I am not advising anyone to do so. But the 1.5mil split into two portions of 750K qualifies two persons to buy two properties with 750K loan each plus BSD of 3% - $5400. If cannot loan the full amount, can reduce accordingly.
 
The shortfall (outside 3 million is the 3% - $5400 and the lawyer fees of a few thousands). Technically possible, but not for everyone. The low risk choice naturally is Option 4.

Landed property prices were given a huge boost by the huge amount of liquidity that was injected into the system in the years following the first QE in 2009. Before that they were terribly sluggish.
 
Moving forward, it is inevitable that global interest rates will be going up sooner than later, and with that liquidity will be curtailed substantially worldwide. This would likely signal a reversal of the stellar performance by the local landed property segment given the removal of the main impetus for the strong surge in prices.
 

My thoughts are, with the TDSR framework permanently in place, it is a little gamble about how the outpacing can actually take place. My those few relatives are amongst the most capable and highly paid employees I have. Any higher, it will have to be the self-employed / CEO with stacks of cash and suitcases to put on table.

For a family with this priority consideration, option 4 is the lowest in risk.
 
Whether enough to cover mortgage without topping cash depends on the age of the borrower, and the rental situation for the property bought. I used URA tool to compute for Signature Park, 1300++ sqft costing 1.4mil (recent transaction). Recent rental is about 2,800 to 3,000. In a 2.6% interest rate loan for 700K (50% downpayment), it is possible to break even for a 35 year tenure. But shorter tenures and higher interests factoring maintenance fee and property tax, can't break even honestly.
 
Each individual has to do his or her calculations accordingly bah depending on preferences. I am not advocating for it and there are risks as well. If unsure, take Option 4.

But I do know of other relatives who are taking option 1 (I think more than 3 mil but I don't know how much), but the difference is they have a parent who is a business owner that brings their cash into millions after selling their HDB in the outskirt. Parents to take care of their child in their landed property.
 
 

Aiyoh that kind, dont say lah....

what is the rental rate for a $1.5M condo tenant out
is it enough for mortgage monthly payment ... remember to pay tax too yo ... ;)
 

 
As per my last estimation done half year ago, you'll need to DP half the amount before your rental can cover your 25 yr mortgage instalments.   If DP only 20%, get ready to fork out cash monthly to cover.
 
If Can only afford DP 20% and lose job, i wish the person very very good luck, becos he will sell at lower orice and pay sellers stamp.

Landed property prices were given a huge boost by the huge amount of liquidity that was injected into the system in the years following the first QE in 2009. Before that they were terribly sluggish.
 
Moving forward, it is inevitable that global interest rates will be going up sooner than later, and with that liquidity will be curtailed substantially worldwide. This would likely signal a reversal of the stellar performance by the local landed property segment given the removal of the main impetus for the strong surge in prices.
 
 

That will affect not just landed property but also condos. But in the very long term, the gap between freehold landed and condo is going to widen , in favour of landed. There is close to  zero potential  supply for freehold landed
My advice to anyone, if you have the means, grab a landed, sit on it until you have no choice but to cash out if you desperately need the money.

It depends on what you buy. Mickey mouse apartments still can cover full mortgage for 80% loan.
 
But that one is a different story from landed in this thread.
 
Landed rent will seldom if ever go near the mortgage payment even with 50% downpayment in today's rates. It's more banking on the increase in land costs.

last week, I went to see a house with a friend and we came across a rebuilt semi-D and noticed there is a manhole at the side of the house near to the back.  I remember my builder once told me to be beware of manhole. This man-hole however is not inside the house ie, not inside the kitchen or granny room but at the side PES / garden.
 
Question, should a buyer be concerned with this man-hole?  is it common?  The seller told me its a man-hole to allow for inspection by authorities in case there is chocking along the sewers line or when a nearby neighbour has renovated their place. 
 
I have heard of inspection chamber.  So is this manhole an inspection chamber?
 
Thanks!

It's nothing to do with cash rich or not.
Option 3 no matter how creatively arranged cannot escape ABSD, even if fully pay for all in cash.
Option 2 means each member takes up the loan in their own name only. Sole owner. It's been discussed on newspaper, several people I know have already done it. No ABSD, no legal conflict at the moment. 
I am not advising anyone to do so. But the 1.5mil split into two portions of 750K qualifies two persons to buy two properties with 750K loan each plus BSD of 3% - $5400. If cannot loan the full amount, can reduce accordingly.
The shortfall (outside 3 million is the 3% - $5400 and the lawyer fees of a few thousands). Technically possible, but not for everyone. The low risk choice naturally is Option 4.

 
it is everything to do with cash rich, else all your alternatives will be implicated by rules from mortgage loans (not to mention gahmen policies)!
Option 2 . .  forget about forums and newspaper articles - this is officially NOT possible in sillypore today.
please provide me if there's any law firm facilitates that.
next.....a landed prop at 1.5m . . .  where to find? (strictly for immediate ROI)
 
Option 3
forget about the above fees, spiltting into 1m props is just kamikaze!
nowadays, nobody can tell if rentals can still cover the depreciations of those recent priced shoebox size condos at 1m !!!
what' bout maintenances . . . i.e tax, mortgage loans and interests????
 
Option 4 is about non-prop investment discussed in other thread liao.......
 
therefore, only Option 1 is worth mentioned (as per the titled thread here)

The bumble bee is not thermodynamically built to fly, but the bee doesn't know it, and flies anyway.
 
Whether you believe you can or you cannot, you are right.
 
Those who have read my postings know that I speak only the truth (sometimes flowered a little), even if its a hard truth. If its an error, I will admit so readily and apologise. Every law firm that deals with real estate facilitates option 2.
 
Option 3 is kamikaze based on the way you see it. This I agree.

Practically speaking old liao, retire in condo is more convenient than landed.
 
imagine your knees chui liao, u can't even climb up to the 2nd floor of your house.
Many terraces also have the 2-3 steps up into the deeper part of the house on the first floor.
Imagine if you have someone with wheelchair in the house. All these need to pay a lot of $ to fix.

 
old stay 1st floor, young stay 2nd floor lol
 
the 2-3 steps can just hack

In the current global financial situation, the couple cited in the article are going to be painting themselves into a tight corner without any room to manuever once interest rates rise and negative equity scenarios start to become commonplace.

those newly 99yrs leasehold, the rentals c**t even match the mortgage loan . . .
apart from the above, any others will require you to fork out the equivalent if not higher than the asking price in order to rent out?

as long as if you are at the corner units, there's bound to be a manhole; you c**t escape.
you can do all kinds of reno as long as you provide access to this manhole
chances of using it is hardly 20-50yrs once!
to me, its worth the risk to cover it with your deco as long as it does not cost you an arm or leg to access it....
you can usually get away with any inspection unless someone (neighbhor) sabo you!
huh? What you mean?

To All here . . . .
this thread, titled . . . Is it a good time to buy a landed property to stay now?
ans: yes.
as long as buyer can afford it, its always a good time to buy a lended property to stay!
 
 
I guess if it is rephrased as . . .  Is it a good buy now for a landed property to stay?
ans: no! 
the perception of higher interest rate, financial instabilities, tightened control - there are still room for landed property to slide before it climbs out real hard & almost affordable...... probably after 2018
 
 
those who made from landed property are either first owner or any purchased before 2009, or maybe 2010
anyone bought after that (especially after 2012) will have no alternative for profiting out from it now.
not to mention those thinking of making big from landed property now!
oops! disclaimer . . . above is strictly for sole buyer only
even developers now would rather holding on, selling at breakeven or until inevitable choices i.e financial savages
 
in short, its not that there's no financial gains from landed property in sillypore now less you are 100% cash rich (i.e. no implications from any impacts of the abovementioned)..... or you have the upperhand like developers etc. 
 
 
true example:
it was a lousy spot (right is a restaurant, left is a mini-temple and another lousy rack&bone unit).
due to poor business, the restaurant halfed its place and auction out the other half.
so, a few brokers, contractor etc. took the opportunity, gathered 1.9m cash and whacked the half, plus the temple.
by 2012, a pair of semi-d (4 storey high) are nicely built and furbished, ready to move-in with another with 1.8m
they market each semi-d unit at 3.4m, expecting a hefty profit 2m (after misc deductions) if both are sold (total at 6.8m)
unfortunately, both semi-d are still for sale today probably due wrong 'timing',
they even cannot sell at 2.9m each (profiting less than 1.5m), may be also its surrounding activities
the group brokers started to finance a bank loan in order to hold on for another 2-3yrs; very confident that its worth till 2018
but the contractor is suing the broker coz he's not able to liquidate his part of his shares and hence dragged for the loan . . .
those in landed propert, or have been hunting houses will probably come across the abovementioned sem-d . . . .
 
above example properly tells you the expectations in landed property today.
nowadays, low rentals' not worth especially from a recent buy (with recent conditions)

Bros ... it really depends on what the family wants to do?
 
Option 1 - Landed; very limited within the confines of our little land deprived country. Please correct me if I am wrong but I don't think the Govt has released any land designated for landed property for some time. All the current landed houses being built are land banks accumulated by various companies. Therefore, in simple economic terms - supply and demand. All of us will aim for landed if we have a chance but for most of us it is out of reach. I think only 15-20% live in landed and as the population grows, this cohort will be more and more exclusive and therefore, the capital gains are there to be achieved provided one is willing to downgrade in future. I agree that the liquidity is being sucked out of the system but I think with Landed the price fluctuations are very very minimal due to the supply and demand issue.
 
Option 2,3 and 4 - Rentals will continue to be squeezed. There will be another supply and demand problem. Oversupply and little demand with the Govt restricting foreign manpower. 
 
Therefore, if I had the money. Definitely Option 1
 
IMHO - Please correct me if I am wrong ... happy to hear another side of story.

The sewerage access hole is almost always parallel running alongside the row of houses.
 
In many instances the sewer pipes run blow the house in the backyard.
 
There are cases where the sewer pipes run below the kitchen area instead of the backyard area.
There are very few cases wherethe sewer pipes run outside the house perimeter.
 
Unless there is a serious choke problem, the sewer access hole will never be opened.
If it is in your kitchen, you will need to allow the authorities into your kitchen if necessary. 
That is the least ideal situation
 
Seasoned landed house buyers do look out for these things.
Just as some folks look at facing and drainage etc...

Timing is important when a purchase involves a quantum that is substantially large relative to the buyer's net worth. 
 
The reason for this is straightforward - if the purchase turns out to be a bad decision, then not only will there be capital loss, there will also be opportunity costs that arise from the funds being locked-in and non-deployable during the buying opportunities during the down-turn.
 
For most people, property purchases fall into this category and extra care should be exercised before committing to them.
 
It is hard to dispute the relevance of the time-tested concept of supply and demand in the freehold landed property segment. It is a fact that Singapore has a scarcity of land and no more freehold land is being created. 
 
However, this does not take away the value of the other components - namely national economic performance, liquidity in the global financial system, to name a few. 
 
The landed property segment has had a run-up in prices that saw many houses having doubled or even tripled in market value during its peak in 2013.
 
The velocity of the run-up took many people by surprise and many scrambled to enter this segment, producing a vicious cycle of price and demand increases that was sustained solely by the immense liquidity made available to the general populace via loose monetary policies and largely unrestrained financing/lending.
 
This mad rush came to an abrupt halt when financing was suddenly shackled through mechanisms such as tighter TDSR and MSR. The volume of landed property transactions fell overnight when buyers realised that they could no longer obtain financing easily while sellers still clung onto the illusion of high asking prices. This produced a mismatch of expectations against affordability and killed transactional volume.
 
Today many sellers of landed properties have begun to temper their asking prices, bringing them down to levels not seen since 2010 and 2011. These are the ones who have still managed to find buyers, albeit at much lower pricing levels. The rest who persist in asking elevated prices have seen little, if any, success.
 
The velocity of the fall in prices can only increase with the onslaught of global financial woes which begun rearing their ugly heads in the middle of 2015 and are now fully manifesting themselves. The commodity market plunge, for example, is the harbinger of darker financial times to come.
 
Global demand for raw materials has fallen due to slowing economies, triggering chain reactions that are becoming vicious cycles with countries falling prey to recessions one after another, and their currencies following suit like clockwork.
 
The fundamentals point to a bearish outlook - amongst many other negative indicators seen over the last few months, China reported today a fall of more than 15% in their imports. As the factory of the world, diminishing import numbers in China signal the glaring truth of slowing global growth and the onset of recessionary times. 
 
The technicals are equally depressing - stock market patterns reminiscent of 2007/2008 are flashing danger signs on the screen of stock market traders and pundits. Having just finished a bear market rally the last week or so, the resumption of the global stock market rout seems inevitable.
 
In view of these, it is advisable to tighten one's belt and enter risk-off / capital-preservation mode. Buying opportunities will emerge, just not at this present moment.

Thanks for the insight.  Mine was just like that.  Originally the hole was at the back yard but when I rebuild, I pushed back until the max set-back so if i didnt move the hole, it would be at the granny room.  So i relocated it to outdoor but still within my compound.
 
However, in the case of the ouse I saw last week, within the house, no holes whatsoever.  Only saw a manhole at the side / back and a sewers line running parallel to the boundary wall at the back yard area.  In my opinion, not an issue coz all the works has been done and holes relocated but according to my builder, not good.  As I'm not very familiar with landed, dont really dare to advise my friend too much.  Otherwise give wrong advice, friend also no more.

What you have shared above I agree totally.  However, I suspect we have a wild-card and that's immigration.  If we based solely on demand from `Old citizens' for lack of a better word, TDSR has indeed clipped the borrowing capacity of most entry level landed buyers.
 
However, I think there will be a wave of demand from new citizens.  The demand from them is something not to be taken lightly.  I have seen it before when they entered the condo market and I believe when they enter the landed market, it will be the same.  These people really really do not play by our rules, ie TDSR.  They are so cash rich it's unbelievable.  While its true the economy is not looking too good, but i also believe there are buying opportunities.
 
PS:  I'm vested in landed ppty so my views are definitely biased.  I'm also waiting for buying opportunites in condo market.

OK let me stir the pot for a more fruitful discussion. My main point is buying property is very much based on a person (and family) situation. Each has its pros and cons. No right or wrong or even best answer.
 
Supposing an average family (2 adults and 2 kids) with a 3 million budget to buy properties. Which of the following combination makes the most sense, provided all options are available to the family? Explain your choice.
 
1. All on one landed property, the max size and best location / type they can find.
 
2. Two of 1.5 million properties (say maybe one landed and one condo). Aiming to rent out one.
 
3. Three properties on average costing 1 million each, likely only private condos. Aiming to rent out two.
 
4. Just get the minimal property (size and location) the family requires (maybe HDB or EC) and invest the rest of the sum in other non-properties instruments.
 

 
In my opinion, one should not dump all monies into 1 ppty, even if its for landed despite the notion that landed will appreciate more than condo.  To really make money out of ppty, you need at least 2 if not 3 ppty coz you will always sell high, buy high if you have only 1 ppty.  This is on the assumption you do not downgrade when you cash out and want to maintain status quo lifestyle.
 
With that in mind, I would suggest option 2 but do not buy jointly.  Get 1 spouse to buy the landed (currently only can buy 99-LH landed for $1.5m) and the other spouse to buy the condo for investment.  For the condo, choose those really close to MRT 2-bedder for investment.  In this way, you can avoid ABSD and also take out max loan of 80%.  No issues imo with taking max loan (for the moment)...go for those 2 yr fixed rate loan.
 
However, please keep at least buffer of 1 yr installments in case can't find ideal tenant and also for buffer for future interest rate hike.  Having said that, imo, as long as can rent out ppty, its good enough for me coz somebody is sharing my capital repayment.  I never expect full coverage of installment if I only place 20% d/p. 
 
Another point to note.  While I would never buy 99-LH landed, I'm suggesting here to buy 99-LH landed on the assumption your cousin wants the most bang-for-buck to house his family.  IMO, as investment, 99-LH landed is very very risky.

The uniqueness of local "native" citizenry lies in their preference for landed properties. This has roots in the generation of people who were born between the 40s and 80s.
 
The older ones experienced the gradual reduction of family living space over time which produced an innate desire to reverse that by aspiring towards the traditional landed properties which would accord them the same luxury of family space.
 
The younger ones in this group inherited this preference from their parents, their belief system shaped by what their parents strongly believed in.
 
If one speaks to the even younger folks who were born in the 90s and beyond, he will realise that this bias has diminished somewhat as their points of focus have shifted further away from a family-centric lifestyle.
 
They were born in the age of "Me, myself and I" and sufficiency of individual and personal living space has become more important than family living space. Accordingly the traditional preference for landed properties has also been reduced accordingly.
 
The "new" citizens, as you have termed them, come from countries where the focus on landed properties does not sit on the same level as the first two groups of our "native" citizens. Many of them are quite content with apartment-style living with common facilities, whether public or private.
 
Based on this, I personally feel that the demand side of the equation (where landed properties are concerned) will erode with time as the older generations pass away and the younger ones become the pre-dominant group of property buyers.
 
 

What you have shared above I agree totally.  However, I suspect we have a wild-card and that's immigration.  If we based solely on demand from `Old citizens' for lack of a better word, TDSR has indeed clipped the borrowing capacity of most entry level landed buyers.
 
However, I think there will be a wave of demand from new citizens.  The demand from them is something not to be taken lightly.  I have seen it before when they entered the condo market and I believe when they enter the landed market, it will be the same.  These people really really do not play by our rules, ie TDSR.  They are so cash rich it's unbelievable.  While its true the economy is not looking too good, but i also believe there are buying opportunities.
 
PS:  I'm vested in landed ppty so my views are definitely biased.  I'm also waiting for buying opportunites in condo market.

Bro, I use that scenario to depict the case for a cousin of mine. Cash out from one popular HDB already 1 million in the bank plus what he accumulated in CPF and cash over the years, total about 1.5mil. His age and income together with his wife qualifies to buy around $3 million property in total.
 
Realistic sum and achievable by MCF standards.
 
 

$1.5 million cash and CPF and buy a $3 million property for own stay?  That does not make financial sense to me.  How old is your cousin?

You have given an excellent example that summarises the stand-off that had existed for quite a while between buyers and sellers of landed properties. However the latest stock market rout (and increased media attention given to the downtrend and its contributory factors) has forced sellers to blink first.
 
 

To All here . . . .
this thread, titled . . . Is it a good time to buy a landed property to stay now?
ans: yes.
as long as buyer can afford it, its always a good time to buy a lended property to stay!
 
 
I guess if it is rephrased as . . .  Is it a good buy now for a landed property to stay?
ans: no! 
the perception of higher interest rate, financial instabilities, tightened control - there are still room for landed property to slide before it climbs out real hard & almost affordable...... probably after 2018
 
 
those who made from landed property are either first owner or any purchased before 2009, or maybe 2010
anyone bought after that (especially after 2012) will have no alternative for profiting out from it now.
not to mention those thinking of making big from landed property now!
oops! disclaimer . . . above is strictly for sole buyer only
even developers now would rather holding on, selling at breakeven or until inevitable choices i.e financial savages
 
in short, its not that there's no financial gains from landed property in sillypore now less you are 100% cash rich (i.e. no implications from any impacts of the abovementioned)..... or you have the upperhand like developers etc. 
 
 
true example:
it was a lousy spot (right is a restaurant, left is a mini-temple and another lousy rack&bone unit).
due to poor business, the restaurant halfed its place and auction out the other half.
so, a few brokers, contractor etc. took the opportunity, gathered 1.9m cash and whacked the half, plus the temple.
by 2012, a pair of semi-d (4 storey high) are nicely built and furbished, ready to move-in with another with 1.8m
they market each semi-d unit at 3.4m, expecting a hefty profit 2m (after misc deductions) if both are sold (total at 6.8m)
unfortunately, both semi-d are still for sale today probably due wrong 'timing',
they even cannot sell at 2.9m each (profiting less than 1.5m), may be also its surrounding activities
the group brokers started to finance a bank loan in order to hold on for another 2-3yrs; very confident that its worth till 2018
but the contractor is suing the broker coz he's not able to liquidate his part of his shares and hence dragged for the loan . . .
those in landed propert, or have been hunting houses will probably come across the abovementioned sem-d . . . .
 
above example properly tells you the expectations in landed property today.
nowadays, low rentals' not worth especially from a recent buy (with recent conditions)

Qualifies and actually buying are two different things.
 
Age very sensitive leh. Later he complain I bitch about him.
 
But I am very sure his combined income can clear TDSR for 1.5million.

that's why they dig deeper by sustaining thru' financial loan - hoping to make a last bet!
 
though you painted a very hazy outcome, we are talking about property, not stock market routes.
the impacts are much 'control' thru' local policy & measures. thus, its a test of affordability against sustainability.
as long as the white paper 2012 stays, our gahmens' policy towards foreign population will still be adjusted
this means they still wanna drive the demands over supply, putting sillypore to that competitive edge against the newcomers in asia.
and that will re-live the property cycles!
this also means bigger cycle against bigger backdrops & bounces, therefore its still a test of affordability against sustainability.
ultimately, whatever drives an investment is still falback to the luxury comforts - ppl wanna buy that prestige
moreover, sillypore remains to be the very rare place where you dun need to build that 6-12ft walls around your landed property.
 
lastly, this thread : Is it a good time to buy a landed property to stay now?
for those whom inspire to own a landed property (I am not referring to the filthy rich), I always say its a race against your credibility against affordability.  and if you are not buying to stay long but rather for some profits, then its the test of your affordability against sustainability, i.e. to bash thru' a longer repititive cycle.............2018 is already 3yrs late compare with the previous

Why cannot believe, so many TDSR calculators out there, just google. 
Maybe I conservative but to buy and stay in a $3m property, you should have a net worth in excess of $5-6m (buying an income producing asset is different). And for someone with $1.5m cash and CPF, HDB and condo may be more suitable, especially if you are already in your late 30s or 40s.  Young people have higher investment horizon and can afford to make more mistakes.

In a bear market, sustaining via repeated extension of financing almost always leads to a catastrophe. Falling security/collateral prices and increased borrowing costs conspire to produce a nasty outcome. There are already several high-profile examples of this in mainstream media and the frequency of such reports is certain to increase as we head deeper into the bear market.
 
The property market, even the high-end GCB segment, is tightly woven into the seams of the global financial markets. The former is a laggard, often trailing the stock markets by 3 to 6 months. The effects of an immense stock market rout slowly, but surely, manifest in the form of diminishing demand and increasing supply (firesales).
 
The phantom cities of China - unfathomable numbers of commercial and residential units of shops, offices, houses and apartments sitting empty without any real users - do not bode well for the property market there. It is a massive bubble waiting to be popped and the trigger of that may well be the rapidly declining growth of the chinese economy that is happening.
 

 
Many developed nations are struggling with unfunded liabilities that run into hundreds of billions of dollars - social welfare, national health insurance, to name a few. The US is a perfect example of a nation mired in external debt so deep and unsolvable, we are talking about trillions of dollars of borrowings that are increasing by millions of dollars every day.
 
When the world embarked on stimulus programmes a few years ago, we were only kicking the can down the road. The confluence of low interest rates and frenzied spending has produced the biggest financial markets bubble the world has ever known. It is not a matter of if but when this will explode. Interest rates cannot stay low forever and the turmoil we see in the stock markets today are only the tip of the iceberg.
 
As interest rates start to go up, economies that have thrived due to easy money falter and crash. The emerging markets in particular (Brazil as an example) are experiencing historically high rates of exiting funds this very moment. Their currencies are reflecting this panic run by having fallen double-digit percentages from just a while ago.
 
The biggest monster of all is the global derivatives market. No one knows for sure the magnitude of the beast that arcane financial wizardry has produced over time. Estimates run into the quadrillion realm. Like many other things, this has been largely fueled by low interest rates. The reversal of cheap money will trigger deleveraging and unwinding that will spark many other global financial situations in the markets.
 
It is tempting to walk away from all of these knowledge and pretend that nothing is wrong. However doing so is irresponsible, not only to oneself but every other person around us. Burying one's head in the sand does not make the storm go away. It only exposes ourselves to great and grave danger.
 
It is crucial to invest time to learn more about the collective situation that we are in and prepare yourself for what is to come.

What you have mentioned also makes sense definitely. But that's not what a proportion of people are going for. And that group seems to be growing amongst the young.
 
Personally, I would argue that its more cautious to split the eggs into two baskets, divided into two properties supposing a person has 1.5mil and can loan 1.5mil. In an emergency, there is still something to sell without selling one's only home. Some may also believe that entry level private homes has the most support in terms of numbers of people eligible for them when they HDB meets MOP. The focus for this proposal is on maximum utility / usage / rental.
 
But there are valid counter-arguments as well about the inherent and innate worth of landed that one can hope to gain the most if prices (especially land value) rises. The focus in this proposal is not on the usage / utility / value but on the limited edition / scarcity and future potential of goods. Within this group, there is a sub-group that has this motto: it doesn't matter if it is older as long as it is freehold.
 
There is still a third group who do not want to accord utility or scarcity value to private housing. They prefer maximum cash and other much more liquid instruments with potentially much higher yields (and also risk), and a home is just for them to live in. They might prefer the most basic home available, and a HDB fits the bill for them, just as any other kind of home they happen to have. Also within this group are those who recognise the utility value of private housing. Amongst the three groups, they might be least interested (but still interested) in future values and potential to lease out. What's more important is that they "consume" the good they buy.
 
Then of course there are those with a mixture of strategies primarily centred around the different aspects of capital gains, yields (rental), utility, and future value / potential. Which is better? Really can't say for sure currently. But hope for all to make the best decisions in each person's context and circumstances. Ultimately, it might be the biggest purchase(s) of our lives.
 
I would like to stir some more by examining the housing strategy (ies) of those with 5 million net worth, but I think it will not be relevant for the masses, and it will be highly controversial depending on what a home means for us. Hope you had fun with the scenario.

Your descriptions are the most detailed and hints of a solid academic background.
 
It also makes the most sense to brace for what is coming. But how exactly to brace?
 
We can all see what went wrong with the "stimulus programmes", but nobody could tell exactly where we are heading in the future. Are we seeing massive unemployment? Or huge deficits? Deflation? Inflation? Massive devaluation? Massive easing? Huge interest rate rises from and by US with the largest debts in the world???
 
The fact is not that people are walking away or pretending. The truth is nobody really knows.
 
Minimising personal liability is but one strategy in my opinion. Maximising our employability and skills (or enhancing our business model) is another. What else can and should we embark upon?

The uniqueness of local "native" citizenry lies in their preference for landed properties. This has roots in the generation of people who were born between the 40s and 80s.
 
The older ones experienced the gradual reduction of family living space over time which produced an innate desire to reverse that by aspiring towards the traditional landed properties which would accord them the same luxury of family space.
 
The younger ones in this group inherited this preference from their parents, their belief system shaped by what their parents strongly believed in.
 
If one speaks to the even younger folks who were born in the 90s and beyond, he will realise that this bias has diminished somewhat as their points of focus have shifted further away from a family-centric lifestyle.
 
They were born in the age of "Me, myself and I" and sufficiency of individual and personal living space has become more important than family living space. Accordingly the traditional preference for landed properties has also been reduced accordingly.
 
The "new" citizens, as you have termed them, come from countries where the focus on landed properties does not sit on the same level as the first two groups of our "native" citizens. Many of them are quite content with apartment-style living with common facilities, whether public or private.
 
Based on this, I personally feel that the demand side of the equation (where landed properties are concerned) will erode with time as the older generations pass away and the younger ones become the pre-dominant group of property buyers.

Whats holding back interest in landed property amongst the younger ones is not the better lifestyle of condo living (which is a fallacy anyway) but AFFORDABILITY. The youth are supposedly more financially savvy than their parents. They will put aside their lifestyle if need be if they see an oppurtunity to make money. You do not need a top investment analyst to figure out which would be a better long term investment in a country where the govt intends to increase the population by anything between 30% (6.9m) to 90% (10m) - freehold landed with almost zero potential supply vs condos. The financially savvy youth would be well aware  that while condos increased by 80% - 130% in the last bull run, landed properties despite a much slower start, went up by 150% - 200%. It would be difficult to replicate such increases going forward, but the gap will continue to widen.
 
The "new" citizens are more used to staying in landed property back home than locals. Lots of landed properties in East Coast, for eg,  have been bought by these "new" citizens , especially Indians.

A glaring aspect of the stimulus programmes is staring us unblinkingly in the face. In spite of the huge amounts of monies that have been pumped into the system, inflation remains stubbornly low. The US Federal Reserve has repeatedly cited that they are waiting for inflation to pick up before they raise the interest rates. Even in Singapore we see that inflation has been at levels lower than those a few years ago. 
 
This contradicts normal economic theory which points towards heightened inflation from monetary expansion programmes. Instead of rising inflation, we are now looking at disinflatory pressure taking root in many economies worldwide. So what is happening?
 
My conjecture is that the velocity of money is diminishing. For every dollar that has been created under the stimulus programmes, only a small fraction actually flows out into the economy to stimulate it. This means that the effectiveness of stimulus programmes has been very low and the only reason why we are still seeing asset price bubbles forming is because the amount produced by such programmes has been unimaginably large.
 
Had the effectiveness of the stimulus programmes been much higher and a higher percentage of the funds went into the real economy, inflation numbers would already have hit double digits based on the quantums that have come from these activities. 
 
In short, a large part of the monies that were produced by these programmes has not gone out into the real economy but is being trapped somewhere in the system (where?).
 
The crunch comes when the reversal takes place, when these stimulus programmes have to be stopped. Just as monetary expansion is inflationary in nature, the opposite of it generates disinflatory effects, and in extreme cases (such as what we have today globally), intense deflationary pressures.
 
Thus, my humble opinion is that when interest rates begin to rise, deflation will come down hard and fast on the global economy. 
 
This will cause the value of cash to increase tremendously, and debt to become more expensive to hold. Asset prices will fall in such a situation. 
 
Nothing happens by chance. Everything that is occurring at the global level has happened to fulfil a certain agenda. 
 
The USD is losing its foothold as the key global reserve currency as the Saudis start moving away from the Petrodollar system. Without any form of active action, the USD will soon lose favour with everyone. 
 
China and Russia are busy hoarding gold as part of their bigger and longer-term plans. The chinese government wants RMB to be part of the SDR but the US has successfully managed to postpone that. 
 
By accumulating gold, China is preparing to shock the world by suddenly announcing the huge gold reserves that they have and thus crashing the USD.
 
And the US is working to prevent this from happening. 
 
For years, it has been common fact that after the gold standard became defunct in the 1930s, fiat currency has became riskier to hold given the ease with which they can be manipulated and abused. 
 
Today, deflation has become a tool with which the value of cash (fiat currency including the USD) can be pushed up and perceived asset values (including those of gold) pushed down. 
 
By reading in between the lines, you will see that this is to buy time until there is something more concrete with which the US can support the USD with. However time is running out. The oil price war between the US and OPEC points towards a grim situation for the former. 
 
Once the timer has run out and the US has nothing feasible to support the USD with, we may be looking at the biggest national debt default in history as everything unwinds in a disorderly fashion.
 
How does one brace himself for such a turn? The key is in reducing debt exposure as quickly as possible, either through partial repayments or completely exiting the liability (selling the underlying security). Also, agility is crucial. 
 
Since deflation pushes down asset prices (including gold), it will be safer to hold cash for a period of time to ride this out. After that initial period, it depends alot on whether the USD crashes. In the event the USD starts crashing, it means that the great default would be imminent. In such a case, gold will immediately reverse its fall in price and shoot skywards.
 

Your descriptions are the most detailed and hints of a solid academic background.
 
It also makes the most sense to brace for what is coming. But how exactly to brace?
 
We can all see what went wrong with the "stimulus programmes", but nobody could tell exactly where we are heading in the future. Are we seeing massive unemployment? Or huge deficits? Deflation?

No body knows what the future holds. If we did, many would have bought 2-3 landed properties in 2005 and would have gone into early retirement by now. While you are writing about doomsday theories, the GCBs property market has begun to stir again. Who do you think is likely to be proven correct - some MCF forumer or someone rich enough  to buy a GCB?

OK hold cash until US ultimately collapses.
 
What if US doesn't collapse, and just symbolically and marginally raises interest rates for the next 10 years? 
 
What if every single country embarks on easing programmes to cope with the previous debt?
 
What are the risks of your strategy?
 

By reading in between the lines, you will see that this is to buy time until there is something more concrete with which the US can support the USD with. However time is running out. The oil price war between the US and OPEC points towards a grim situation for the former. 
 
Once the timer has run out and the US has nothing feasible to support the USD with, we may be looking at the biggest national debt default in history as everything unwinds in a disorderly fashion.
 
How does one brace himself for such a turn? The key is in reducing debt exposure as quickly as possible, either through partial repayments or completely exiting the liability (selling the underlying security). Also, agility is crucial. 
 
Since deflation pushes down asset prices (including gold), it will be safer to hold cash for a period of time to ride this out. After that initial period, it depends alot on whether the USD crashes. In the event the USD starts crashing, it means that the great default would be imminent. In such a case, gold will immediately reverse its fall in price and shoot skywards.

My intention is not to frighten people but to create awareness. It is important that people are aware of the current situation and not just live blindly with the mistaken notion that everything is fine and dandy. 
 
It is not about personal wealth. Everything is transient and relative. What will be debilitating is the effect that such a calamity has on the individual and family, and that is what I am trying to put across here.
 
We cannot pretend that the storm is not approaching when we see the first signs. And it would be selfish to not alert others to the same.

my question is wouldn't cash and gold be useless in a doomsday scenario too?
 
i would store food and water if this happens

Food and water have the problem of being perishable and difficult to store for long-term.
 
Cash and gold are not solve-alls. Each has its own use at the right time.
 
Cash eventually will become worthless once the fiat currency system collapses which inevitably will happen due to the underlying fundamental cracks that have started forming decades ago but which are worsening over time.
 
Gold is also not a magical salve. The only reason why it has more robustness as a store of value is due to legacy, and largely that, besides its industrial application.
 
The key is in being agile and aware. Hold cash when cash is relevant. Hold gold when gold is relevant. Exchange both for food and water promptly when the need arises (e.g. war) but not too soon since food and water have limited lifespan.

There are direct and pronounced effects of rising interest rates on the financial markets and the real economy, they are not merely hypothetical instruments. When interest rates go up, massive deflation sets in and causes other situations to arise. It would be foolhardy to pretend that the rising rates would not have any impact on the current highly-leveraged system.
 
Not every country has the luxury of being able to embark on monetary expansion programmes. In particular the emerging markets are already showing signs of great distress. The global economy is like a race. The stronger runners can sprint while the weaker ones struggle to keep up. Inevitably all of them are part of a larger group (e.g. class of students) whose fragmentation will be brought about by the fall of any or a few of them. 
 
When there are signs that a rainstorm is approaching, do you not bring along an umbrella? Personally I would think that the cost of getting prepared far outweigh the costs of not being prepared. Thus the question would not be if the rainstorm does not happen, but if it does.
 
I feel it is important for people to know so that they are aware and can make a judgement call for themselves.
 
There is no coercion and I certainly do not have the ability to force people to accept my views. I just hope that through our sharing, there can be awareness created so that individuals can have an opportunity to make sound decisions based on a more complete picture of the situation.

There's only one truth about property to me.
 
Property is a good hedge against inflation (whether from quantitative easing or real inflation). Hence property is important in whatever portfolio you have.

There is a time of relevance for cash as there is a time of relevance for gold and even debt.
 
It is about being agile and aware so that one is aware of the appropriate time for the various forms/stores of wealth.
 
If cash is worthless, what is debt?

I agree with you fundamentally in some ways.
 
Yet we have to acknowledge the risks that come with hoarding cash. I prefer presenting the full picture, pros and cons, risks and potentials.
 
If one's only financial portfolio is a giant property with huge debts, the risks are huge. But holding in purely cash is also risky, like you said, if cash becomes worthless.
 
After many countries easing, today is Singapore's second easing in a year. Easing is designed to promote inflation I am sure you are aware.
 
And fundamentally, I don't believe the US or China (either or both) are going to let the system crash in a big way when there are many other strategies available.
 
So back to my basic understanding that no one knows exactly where we are heading and how we will get there. I am sure I don't have the answer yet.

The property market, even the high-end GCB segment, is tightly woven into the seams of the global financial markets. The former is a laggard, often trailing the stock markets by 3 to 6 months. The effects of an immense stock market rout slowly, but surely, manifest in the form of diminishing demand and increasing supply (firesales).
 
The phantom cities of China - unfathomable numbers of commercial and residential units of shops, offices, houses and apartments sitting empty without any real users - do not bode well for the property market there. It is a massive bubble waiting to be popped and the trigger of that may well be the rapidly declining growth of the chinese economy that is happening.

 
Don't really agree with this part. The chinese are more than willing to buy property in cities where they feel their money is safer.
Cue Auckland in NZ, Tokyo, Australia, Canada.
They are looking for places where they can get potentially be PR or even citizens.
Even with the financial storm in the stock market, (according to bloomberg) Auckland house prices are up by 10-15% for one year due to the attractive NZD currently.
 
SG is lagging behind right now cos of the foreign buyer restrictions. 
 
Yes bubbles are developing in some of these countries, but these buyers will still be there even in bad markets.

In a bear market, sustaining via repeated extension of financing almost always leads to a catastrophe. Falling security/collateral prices and increased borrowing costs conspire to produce a nasty outcome. There are already several high-profile examples of this in mainstream media and the frequency of such reports is certain to increase as we head deeper into the bear market . . . .
 


sigh . . . . I'm    . . . I kept steering back to this thread on 'landed property'
and you are bringing the country economy succumps to world finances as if sillypore will never have another SG10s.....
no lahhhh, there will still be at least another 20-30yrs of 'glory' sustainability in this state - if you have read sillypore's finance stances.
 
i have to say . . . there are mismatch here, pouring incompatibilities to this topic like Seohster's option 2..... using financial market perceptions against regulations..... its of different theoretically 'industry'......     
 
i will agree if option 2 is meant for shophouse, office, commercials.....
but for a landed and a condo with 1.5m cash against another 1.5m loan, in sillypore and worst..... in this timing!
its always easy to present theoretically of the existence . . . but to those whom have been on this, profession, market, or ever to defend his/her assets with the above's from the past, they will know what I'm saying.
 
coming back to this topic . . .
Is it a good time - depends on buyer's credibility more than affordability
buy a landed property - at times, its more the availability that supersedes or manage the credibility, thus raise up buyer's affordability
to stay now - now, there's no alternative to buyer, he/she must stay for the worthiness
profit or loss - only the buyer knows his/her credibility against sustainability, plus the accountability to own a landed prop (stay or rent)
stay or rent - this is very much dependent on buyer's stand for himself/herself, the family etc...
(of coz, this is not worth discussing at all if buyers can flip 3m cash anytime)
 
a better analogy will be . . . .
hmm,  why'd I wanna spend so much and risk so much to buy a landed prop just to rent out . . .  
since I can afford my current expenses since my credbility stays with my well paid and stable job
I might as well stay since I can sustain for a while; and my love to my family plus I'm tired of investing rather than enjoying
unless my credibility progress along with the time, i.e. family expenses & affordability - then I'm inheriting this 'priceless' prop
(honestly, a salaried person's credibility will only depreciate with ages!)
so, I will then wait for the right time to sell . . . 
 
this thread may as well be . . . Is it a good time to sell a landed property now?
 
and I bet the next best discussion topic here is . . . 
 . . . . Is landed property a much more profitable asset than a condo?
 
 
PS: the accountability to own a landed prop refers to the 'hao lian' of show-offs that can be priceless depending on some ppl . . . .

totally agree . . .  foreign buyer restrictions!
and I also kepT stressing that competitive edge is . . .
there's no need to have an armour, guns or 6-12 ft tall walls around houses here - this explains all !!!
with the 2012 white paper, this restrictions may continue with popularity towards locals (since majority >80% do not stay on landed) perhaps replacing 'foreign' to 'would-be citizens'...... afterall, these filthy rich foreigners dun mind their sons to serve the local army, and their daughters coming home safe in sexy dresses  . . . . !

Whats holding back interest in landed property amongst the younger ones is not the better lifestyle of condo living (which is a fallacy anyway) but AFFORDABILITY. The youth are supposedly more financially savvy than their parents. They will put aside their lifestyle if need be if they see an oppurtunity to make money. You do not need a top investment analyst to figure out which would be a better long term investment in a country where the govt intends to increase the population by anything between 30% (6.9m) to 90% (10m) - freehold landed with almost zero potential supply vs condos. The financially savvy youth would be well aware  that while condos increased by 80% - 130% in the last bull run, landed properties despite a much slower start, went up by 150% - 200%. It would be difficult to replicate such increases going forward, but the gap will continue to widen.
 
The "new" citizens are more used to staying in landed property back home than locals. Lots of landed properties in East Coast, for eg,  have been bought by these "new" citizens , especially Indians.

 
I'm also leaning on the side that new citizens are more likely to choose landed over an apt in the sky.  And this is from my own experience but not here in Sg.  My relative who migrated to Perth bought a 500sqm single story landed for AUD 150K donkey years ago (ok, maybe late 90s).  10 years ago when I started my interest in ppty investment, it was AUD 250k.  Fast forward to today, my relative's neighbour sold a smaller plot (350sqm) land for AUD 1m last month.  And all this while, the prices of that street were driven up by new citizens (a small % were Sg and malaysians but the majority were from ....you probably can guess where....They buy without even bargaining at all.  Once on the market, they just buy and without financing required.  They are on a different level from everyone.
 
And coupled with practically no new landed supply and the white paper, I can't ignore my instints that land price and landed ppty prices can only rise faster than condo.  Now, I'm really not trying to drum up support for landed coz I'm not looking to sell.  In fact, if i could, i would buy another and low prices will benefit me coz I'm looking to invest some more but time is not on my side due to shorter tenure.  But I really believe in what I said above and would like to share my thoughts.  In fact, I wish all old citizens can see this and get a piece of the pie coz it pains me to see the new citizens buying up our land.  Truely, this is from my heart.

I wonder eventually did Milgram parents buy the small 1300sqf tai keng landed or not at $980k back in 2008. 
 
Sometimes, what seems to be obvious is really not that obvious coz there are greater powers to be and invisible hands out there who control the economy.  And the only way to profit is based on boom bust strategy.  And usually the next boom will be higher than the last bust.  So what's important is never borrow till the tilt.  Keep plenty of buffers in case shit hits the fan. Nobody makes money in a stable rising economy.  It's too slow so the power brokers WILL create boom and bust situations.

Investment?  Not sure.  Its rather illiquid.  More like a hedge like somebody mentioned, against inflation. Even condo ppty takes a while to liquidate, let alone landed.
 
I prefer more liquid assets or better, puting money in business as investments.
 
But I really appreciate all the sharing here.  Not just bull stories. Unfortunately i cant `praise' due to lack of points but OmOm has some points I like

Thanks for sharing.
 
The young (say in their 20s) are not likely to like to cook, let alone manage a landed property. Even the "new" citizens coming in, they are likely in their forties or fifties?
 
With the TDSR, the landed segment is unlikely to be affordable by the "old citizens". There is therefore a limit to how far it can run in my opinion.
 
The ones who can buy up the landed properties in future will be the Govt, who may likely use it for redevelopment for infrastructure and higher density uses. My thoughts only.
 
 

I'm also leaning on the side that new citizens are more likely to choose landed over an apt in the sky.  And this is from my own experience but not here in Sg.  My relative who migrated to Perth bought a 500sqm single story landed for AUD 150K donkey years ago (ok, maybe late 90s).  10 years ago when I started my interest in ppty investment, it was AUD 250k.  Fast forward to today, my relative's neighbour sold a smaller plot (350sqm) land for AUD 1m last month.  And all this while, the prices of that street were driven up by new citizens (a small % were Sg and malaysians but the majority were from ....you probably can guess where....They buy without even bargaining at all.  Once on the market, they just buy and without financing required.  They are on a different level from everyone.

A glaring aspect of the stimulus programmes is staring us unblinkingly in the face. In spite of the huge amounts of monies that have been pumped into the system, inflation remains stubbornly low. The US Federal Reserve has repeatedly cited that they are waiting for inflation to pick up before they raise the interest rates. Even in Singapore we see that inflation has been at levels lower than those a few years ago. 
 
This contradicts normal economic theory which points towards heightened inflation from monetary expansion programmes. Instead of rising inflation, we are now looking at disinflatory pressure taking root in many economies worldwide. So what is happening?
 
My conjecture is that the velocity of money is diminishing. For every dollar that has been created under the stimulus programmes, only a small fraction actually flows out into the economy to stimulate it. This means that the effectiveness of stimulus programmes has been very low and the only reason why we are still seeing asset price bubbles forming is because the amount produced by such programmes has been unimaginably large.
 
Had the effectiveness of the stimulus programmes been much higher and a higher percentage of the funds went into the real economy, inflation numbers would already have hit double digits based on the quantums that have come from these activities. 
 
In short, a large part of the monies that were produced by these programmes has not gone out into the real economy but is being trapped somewhere in the system (where?).
 
The crunch comes when the reversal takes place, when these stimulus programmes have to be stopped. Just as monetary expansion is inflationary in nature, the opposite of it generates disinflatory effects, and in extreme cases (such as what we have today globally), intense deflationary pressures.
 
Thus, my humble opinion is that when interest rates begin to rise, deflation will come down hard and fast on the global economy. 
 
This will cause the value of cash to increase tremendously, and debt to become more expensive to hold. Asset prices will fall in such a situation. 
 
Nothing happens by chance. Everything that is occurring at the global level has happened to fulfil a certain agenda. 
 
The USD is losing its foothold as the key global reserve currency as the Saudis start moving away from the Petrodollar system. Without any form of active action, the USD will soon lose favour with everyone. 
 
China and Russia are busy hoarding gold as part of their bigger and longer-term plans. The chinese government wants RMB to be part of the SDR but the US has successfully managed to postpone that. 
 
By accumulating gold, China is preparing to shock the world by suddenly announcing the huge gold reserves that they have and thus crashing the USD.
 
And the US is working to prevent this from happening. 
 
For years, it has been common fact that after the gold standard became defunct in the 1930s, fiat currency has became riskier to hold given the ease with which they can be manipulated and abused. 
 
Today, deflation has become a tool with which the value of cash (fiat currency including the USD) can be pushed up and perceived asset values (including those of gold) pushed down. 
 
By reading in between the lines, you will see that this is to buy time until there is something more concrete with which the US can support the USD with. However time is running out. The oil price war between the US and OPEC points towards a grim situation for the former. 
 
Once the timer has run out and the US has nothing feasible to support the USD with, we may be looking at the biggest national debt default in history as everything unwinds in a disorderly fashion.
 
How does one brace himself for such a turn? The key is in reducing debt exposure as quickly as possible, either through partial repayments or completely exiting the liability (selling the underlying security). Also, agility is crucial. 
 
Since deflation pushes down asset prices (including gold), it will be safer to hold cash for a period of time to ride this out. After that initial period, it depends alot on whether the USD crashes. In the event the USD starts crashing, it means that the great default would be imminent. In such a case, gold will immediately reverse its fall in price and shoot skywards.

 
Depends on whether you believe in Kondratiev cycles.

The ones who can buy up the landed properties in future will be the Govt, who may likely use it for redevelopment for infrastructure and higher density uses. My thoughts only.
this thought does not come with speculations but history prevails . . . look at the most recent ones . . .  paya lebar, teacher estate etc. . .
so choosing a landed gotta be careful of its surroundings...... next, jurong west

Ok i be serious now.
 
You dont like landed because you havent quite grown up yet.
And you havent exactly made your money either.
At most in your early thirties and still living with your parents, grandparents, uncle/aunties.
You are dying for a space of your own so a small simple condo is currently your dream at the moment.
 
Its ok, i was like that 15yrs ago.
Started out with a 1800sft bachelors pad and another studio loft in D9.
I never ever thought of buying landed as a late 20something to early 30something.
Its a youngster, wannabe hip thing lah.
I understand, i was young and stupid too. (Lucky not too stupid)
 
You'll grow up.
 
Yes.

 
Maybe I haven't grown up.. when compared to your age?
 
I am a self made man. I make my own money. I stay in the landed property that belongs to my parents because they have one extra. It's just me and my fiance so it's a big waste of space. I am waiting for my own private condo to be ready which I bought with my own $. Sorry I took housing loan though. I buy my own cars, I even pay for my dad's car instalment.
 
I am not even 30 yet but near. But I think that's a good thing in my case.
 
I was just sharing the woes of living in a landed property but you just had to take it another way and find every single opportunity to show off to other forum users here or put others down. You even resort to calling people haven't grown up.. what? Must reach 40-50 years old and chubby or uncle like you to be considered grown up?
 
Whatever rows your boat ^^ I am out of here.

OK hold cash until US ultimately collapses.
 
What if US doesn't collapse, and just symbolically and marginally raises interest rates for the next 10 years? 
 
What if every single country embarks on easing programmes to cope with the previous debt?
 
What are the risks of your strategy?

Agree... hold cash.
 
But.. but... in which currency?
US$? But the prediction is that US$ will crash.
 
RMB? RM? Peso? IDR?  
 
Then, which bank?
ANZ, Maybank, BPI, BCA, 
 
Ok... S$ in CPF is the safest.

Bro T2, I think he was offended because you assumed in your words that one day, when he has reached your age, you would think like him. 
 
It's not true, or at least not definitely true. Some people  don't care or are oblivious about their housing. Some need more space some need much lesser just for example. 
 
And there's definitely generation gaps in preference. Even differences across countries. A greater acceptance of individual differences and preferences will help.

Corrections dude.....whether he has reached my age or not, I will not think like him.......hahaha (picking on your sentence formation)
 
But its clear he was offended more because he thought that i said he was using his fathers money etc...
So he said he is self made , buy own house , own car etc....
Which is completely misunderstanding the post becos he was blinded by pride.

Best is to stay landed and have nearby condo to use the facilities 
 
Seriously though if a married couple has kids (or no kids) and staying with parents I can 100% say landed is the best, especially if the couple has their own floor or the house. The conflicts between in laws and wife will likely cut by 50% (unless the wife + mother in law are best friends).

Some people buy SUV, some people by 2-seater roadster. Even at the age of 50, still got uncles buy roadster.
 
Some people buy landed, some people buy condo...
 
It's a matter of lifestyle. No right, no wrong.
 
Got buy can already, better than some people just everyday complain prices high, this expensive, that expensive... then never buy, then sit there and complain government.

Rise in transactions of landed homes
By Michael Lim / The Edge Property | November 12, 2015 10:00 AM MYT
 
The demand for landed homes in prime residential Districts 9, 10 and 11 is on the rise. A check on the latest URA Realis caveats lodged as at Oct 13 shows that 53 landed homes (with land areas ranging from 3,100 to 10,760 sq ft) were transacted in the first nine months of 2015. The figure is equivalent to the number of homes sold in 2013, and has even surpassed the number of transactions made last year.
 
Within the prime Central neighbourhoods of Districts 9, 10, 11 and 21 (Upper Bukit Timah, King Albert Park, Old Holland Road, Binjai Park and Yarwood Avenue), detached homes contributed to 40% of the overall transaction volume, according to Realstar Premier’s analysis. Semi-detached homes made up 37% of all transactions in the area, followed by terraced houses (23%).
 
“The rise in demand could be partly owing to the increase in the number of new or redeveloped units that are being put up for sale,” says William Wong, managing director of Realstar Premier. In recent years, many boutique developers and even construction companies have embarked on redevelopment of landed homes for sale.
 
RealStar Premier is currently marketing 168 brand new detached, semi-detached and terraced houses worth close to $1.28 billion for sale. The houses are mainly developed by boutique developers.
 
 
 
What’s on the market?
An example of a boutique developer is Alteo Developments, helmed by Singaporean businessman Alan Teo. Alteo Developments has redeveloped three properties to date, two of which are detached houses in the Mount Sinai area and a pair of semi-detached houses on Gilstead Road.
 
The detached house in Mount Sinai Road developed by Alteo was put up for sale last weekend (Oct 10 to 11) and is believed to have been sold. The newly completed 2½-storey unit contains five en suite bedrooms with a built-up area of 10,000 sq ft and comes with a swimming pool. It sits on a freehold land area of 4,900 sq ft. The house was listed at a price tag of $10.8 million ($2,200 psf).
 
Alteo Developments also purchased an old semi-detached house along Jalan Jelita which sits on a 3,821 sq ft freehold site in 2013 for $6.1 million. The property was redeveloped into a brand-new double-storey detached house which was sold last month for $7.55 million ($1,976 psf), according to caveats lodged.
 
Another boutique developer who has de veloped a series of seven new detached houses on Jalan Bahasa in prime District 10 is AN Developments, which is owned by an oldrich family that has been investing in Good Class Bungalows, particularly in the prestigious Queen Astrid Park neighbourhood, for decades. The seven houses were designed by acclaimed archi tects of private luxury homes in Singapore and Sentosa Cove, among them K2LD Architects, Guz Wilkinson, Aamer Architects and Kian Chong of TAKE Architects.
 
Two of the houses, No 60 and No 66 Jalan Bahasa, by AN Developments, are now on the market. Both were designed by Aamer Architects and are mirror images of each other. The No 60 property has a built-up area of 6,167 sq ft and sits on a land area of 5,508 sq ft. It has four en suite bedrooms, a master suite, a study and, in addition to the living and dining room, three family rooms. The house also comes with a 13.8m lap pool. Newly completed, the house is on the market with a price tag of $13.7 million ($2,487 psf).
 
The No 66 house sits on a freehold site of 5,939 sq ft and has a built-up area of 6,559 sq ft. It has the same configuration and specifications as the No 60 unit and is only available for lease at $24,000 a month.
 
Just around the corner of Jalan Bahasa sit two newly redeveloped detached houses on Kheam Hock Road. Both houses were developed by Hwa Seng Investment, a subsidiary of civil engineering and construction company Hwa Seng Builder.
 
Hwa Seng is no stranger to property development, having developed the 46-unit boutique condo The Urbanite on Hertford Road, off Keng Lee Road. It is one of the consortium partners involved in the development of Heron Bay, a 394-unit executive condo in Upper Serangoon View, as well as two semi-detached houses on Mackerrow Road within the Braddell Heights area and another pair of semi-detached houses in Jalan Selanting, off Jalan Jurong Kechil, in the Upper Bukit Timah area.
 
The detached houses on Kheam Hock Road are a redevelopment of an old detached house which sat on a freehold land area of 11,370 sq ft. Hwa Seng purchased the site in May 2013 for $17.6 million, according to a caveat lodged with URA Realis.
 
Hwa Seng then tore the house down and built two brand new houses, each with a built-up area of 7,100 sq ft sitting on 5,683 sq ft of land. Each 2½-storey house comes with a basement car park for six cars, five bedrooms and an infinity pool. The asking price for each house is said to be $13.5 million.
 
 
 
ABSD deadline looms
Another reason for the increase in transactions of new landed homes by these boutique developers is they need to sell the properties within a certain time frame, says Realstar’s Wong.
 
Under the guidelines set by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore in January 2013, developers must complete the development of land with four or fewer residential units within three years from the date of the contract or agreement to purchase the site. They also have to sell the units within three years and one month of the land transaction, failing which they will be subject to additional buyer’s stamp duty (ABSD), together with interest at 5% per annum.
 
However, Wong says he is starting to see developers returning to pick up old landed properties with a 999-year leasehold or freehold tenure and redevelopment potential. “They are buying with the view that the market will pick up again in two years, by which [time] their new developments will be ready for sale,” he adds.
 
According to Alan Cheong, head of research for Savills Singapore, prices of landed homes in prime districts 9, 10 and 11 have come off 10% to 15% from their peak in 2013. “Many of the rich feel there is limited downside from the current price levels and that could explain why we are seeing an increase in the number of landed homes being snapped up,” he says.

If TS has bought the house when he started this Thread, he would have made his $. Property, especially 999 yrs and above will appreciate given our land size. There will be low but there will be the next highest peak.
 
I am trying to answer to the question. That is 'good time to buy a landed property to stay'. This question will be best answered by the occupier. But if the question is about investment, then my answer is always yes if you have the cash to spare.
 
Property is also about location. However, in Singapore, any location will be The Location in just a matter of when. Of course if you are referring to JB, then please don't quote me.

THE STAGES OF A BUBBLE 
Hyman Minsky
 
DISPLACEMENT
 

Every crisis starts with a disturbance. Investors get enamoured by a new paradigm. It might be a new technological invention or a shift in economic policy. For example, the dot com boom or the reduction of interest rates.
 
BOOM
 
Following displacement comes the price increase, which is barely noticeable initially. As the price increase gains momentum, people will start to notice and enter the market. The asset in question attracts widespread media coverage. Fuelled by cheap and readily-available credit, more “outsiders” fearing missing the opportunity of a lifetime, rush in to participate.
 
The market starts to overtrade due to the effects of easy credit. Overtrading stimulates volume and shortages emerge. Prices soar and easy and quick profits are made. More “outsiders” are attracted to the ever-accelerating prices. The “greater fool theory” plays out everywhere. The greater fool theory (also called survivor investing) is the belief held by one who makes a questionable investment, with the assumption that they will be able to sell it later to "a greater fool”. During this phase, new valuation measures and metrics are touted to justify the relentless rise in prices. The runaway prices attract the foolish, greedy and desperate into the market. As a fire needs more fuel, a bubble needs more participants.
 
EUPHORIA
 
The bubble now enters its most tragic stage. The wise will rise and say the bubble cannot continue. They put together convincing arguments based on sound fundamentals and economic logic. However, these arguments are drowned out by charlatans who justify the insane prices by the same euphoric claim that this new and different world equates higher prices. The wise loses the argument simply because prices are still rising. The charlatan’s unjustified optimism prevails. 
 
The charlatan then proceeds to bolster their optimism with their biggest lie: when prices finally reach their new long run level, there will be a “soft landing”. The idea of a gentle deceleration claims the nerves. The outsiders who went in know that prices can’t rise forever, but rarely acts on this knowledge. Everything is safe as long as they exit before the bubble bursts. Those left out of the market are stuck in a dilemma. They cannot enter as prices are sky high but they cannot stay out also for fear of prices shooting further upwards again. They know they have missed the beginning of the bubble and to add salt to injury, they are bombarded with stories of easy riches and massive profits. The strong stay out and reconcile themselves to the missed opportunity. The weak enter the fire and are damned.
 
PROFIT TAKING
 
A bubble demands that everyone believes in a brighter future, and so long as this euphoria continues, the bubble is sustained. As madness gradually overwhelms the outsiders, the insiders remember the old world, lose their faith and start to panic. They know it’s all gone too far and start to cash out unnoticed and hopes to escape unscathed. Few outsiders will notice this. Insider profit taking signals the beginning of the end.
But estimating the exact time when a bubble is due to collapse can be a difficult exercise and extremely hazardous to one's financial health. It only takes a relatively minor event to prick a bubble, but once it is pricked, the bubble cannot "inflate" again.
 
REVULSION
 
Sometimes, panic of the insiders infects the outsiders. Other times, it is the end of cheap credit or some unanticipated piece of news. But whatever may be, euphoria is replaced with revulsion. Outsiders rushed to sell, but there are no buyers. Panic sets in; prices start to tumble downwards, credit dries up, and losses start to accumulate. Investors and speculators, faced with margin calls and plunging values of their holdings, now want to liquidate them at any price. As supply overwhelms demand, asset prices slide sharply.

EUPHORIA
 
The bubble now enters its most tragic stage. The wise will rise and say the bubble cannot continue. They put together convincing arguments based on sound fundamentals and economic logic. However, these arguments are drowned out by charlatans who justify the insane prices by the same euphoric claim that this new and different world equates higher prices. The wise loses the argument simply because prices are still rising. The charlatan’s unjustified optimism prevails. 
 
The charlatan then proceeds to bolster their optimism with their biggest lie: when prices finally reach their new long run level, there will be a “soft landing”. The idea of a gentle deceleration claims the nerves. The outsiders who went in know that prices can’t rise forever, but rarely acts on this knowledge. Everything is safe as long as they exit before the bubble bursts. Those left out of the market are stuck in a dilemma. They cannot enter as prices are sky high but they cannot stay out also for fear of prices shooting further upwards again. They know they have missed the beginning of the bubble and to add salt to injury, they are bombarded with stories of easy riches and massive profits. The strong stay out and reconcile themselves to the missed opportunity. The weak enter the fire and are damned.
 
PROFIT TAKING
 
A bubble demands that everyone believes in a brighter future, and so long as this euphoria continues, the bubble is sustained. As madness gradually overwhelms the outsiders, the insiders remember the old world, lose their faith and start to panic. They know it’s all gone too far and start to cash out unnoticed and hopes to escape unscathed. Few outsiders will notice this. Insider profit taking signals the beginning of the end.
But estimating the exact time when a bubble is due to collapse can be a difficult exercise and extremely hazardous to one's financial health. It only takes a relatively minor event to prick a bubble, but once it is pricked, the bubble cannot "inflate" again.
 
REVULSION
 
Sometimes, panic of the insiders infects the outsiders. Other times, it is the end of cheap credit or some unanticipated piece of news. But whatever may be, euphoria is replaced with revulsion. Outsiders rushed to sell, but there are no buyers. Panic sets in; prices start to tumble downwards, credit dries up, and losses start to accumulate. Investors and speculators, faced with margin calls and plunging values of their holdings, now want to liquidate them at any price. As supply overwhelms demand, asset prices slide sharply.

THE STAGES OF A BUBBLE 
Hyman Minsky
 
DISPLACEMENT
 

Every crisis starts with a disturbance. Investors get enamoured by a new paradigm. It might be a new technological invention or a shift in economic policy. For example, the dot com boom or the reduction of interest rates.
 
BOOM
 
Following displacement comes the price increase, which is barely noticeable initially. As the price increase gains momentum, people will start to notice and enter the market. The asset in question attracts widespread media coverage. Fuelled by cheap and readily-available credit, more “outsiders” fearing missing the opportunity of a lifetime, rush in to participate.

in general SG isnt in a bubble but instead a slow moving train wreck...
 
if garmen didnt do any CMs, the bubble wld have blown up n busted abt 1-2yrs ago, instead we r like zombie apocalypse, IMO much worse than a boom bust situation since money isnt flowing anywhere at all hence our crap economy growth. Garmen has effectively made us an irrelevant zombie state which no investors want to put $ into anymore, this is why next yr they have to boost liquidity or else itll get worse

I somehow feel that it stayed at the last cycle.
 
Is that bottom, I dont know. But seems to have gone neither up nor down in a drastic way.
 
Just occasional blip like a ripple.

any idea how much it will cost to tear down and rebuild a house?The last i checked, many years ago, $400-500k for terrace house with build in of 3000 sq ft (no piling required), the range is huge depending on the design and materials used.  Think it should cost at least $600k now for a complete rebuild.

let me tell you my thought on elevator for landed property. if you plan to have one, do seriously consider installing a fixed land telephone line and a panic alarm button that will send a siren outside your house. 
 
one day the lift jammed and you are alone.i dont think you carry your handphone everywhere you go within you own home. whole family and maid wont be back a few days, Murphy law, you will be dead by the time somebody comes back.

2 storey is ok, best is buy a 1-storey bungalow with a big garden, well ventilated and fully airconditioned with no bloody stairs to deal with on a daily basis.  My dream home.

single storey house is about having enough windows. so your land must be big to allow you to create the openings. airwell helps but nothing beats the cross wind ventilation. actually those colonial old bangalows are great. maintenance costly though.

These days it is very difficult or nearly impossible to pay for just land price alone to do rebuild. And the other problem with landed is that a smaller land has a cheaper total price which means it offer better "affordability", as a result, the smaller the land is, the higher $ psf land it will be. Many of the two thousand plus sqft unit are still selling at abt low $1+k for reconstruct or major A&A. Thise are quite good price but the total cost after A&A would be quite high. And location is the other question, but location for landed have very limited option.
I agree, this unit is far too expensive.
 
this unit was asking for 2.6m beginning of the year, now the price revised to 2.9m.  This is one of the units that raise price over the past few months. condition is original.

I find beauty world especially the Chun Tin area alot of run down, looks like haunted house look. Probably owner sitting on it for buyer to fork out the moola to buy over for rebuild.

On the question of rebuild and A&A, the last I checked was around $300psf.
 
I was reading some discussion on landed vs condo and whether age will change the preference. I grew up in a landed semi-D but frankly I would choose a condo any time for stay or investment. And also it depends on lifestyle and size of family. If it's just a small family (hubby wife maybe one child) then a decent sized condo is more than enough. Landed has its own set of problems - mozzies, heat, snakes, rats, maintain the lawn, water pressure etc.  And if its just 2 or 3 pax living in the house, then seriously there is no need for such a large space, a decently sized condo should be enough. Nowadays its about living simply and not buying too many material things so no need such a large house to store things. And I am paranoid and always thinking about what if I lose my job or my business don't do well? For a condo, at least I know I can rent at a decent yield. Personal opinion. But for the super rich, their thinking will be different. But for upper middle class who can only afford the low-end landed, i.e. those below $10m, then seriously I think a condo living may give better quality of life than landed. For for the same $10m, buy a few condos to rent out, and if die die want to stay landed, then rent a landed property to stay and still got loose change.

For a close $2m landed, in my personal opinion it is not worth buying 99years LH.  999 or freehold would be  a better option.  Some new units at Pavilion is going at around 2.6m too if you do mind the location and it is FH.

Different homes for different stages of life. My own experience:
 
Very young I grew up in a large bungalow. Friends would come over after school, and we would climb trees, play table-tennis, rounders and soccer in the garden. Fun growing up. Family sold it when it cost too much to maintain. Constant roof leaks, wildlife finding its way in, security threats, power failures, trespassers, a way of life.
 
I got married, bought a suburban terrace house in original condition. Lived in it for 10 years before splurging on major A&A. House was comfortable, airy. My kids grew up in the garden, playing with the dog. Then the kids went to college, and the garden usage went to 0. Sold it when the kids were hardly home, and they coming home late at night became a worry due to loitering foreign workers. I was not in love with doing the weekly gardening. Moved to a high security condo.
 
Now I am retired but physically active. I live in a high rise condo with lovely view, airy and full facilities for me and family to use, with no maintenance worries. Single storey means no need maid to clean. Grown kids use the pool, gym, courts and have friends over for parties. Makes the rather high conservancy fees worth it. Kids are working now and moving out slowly. Next phase when I am less mobile, is to downgrade to a HDB or apartment with no facilities, and free up cash.  
 
My experience is buy a home to meet your lifestyle at different stages of life. Now in my later years, I want to spend little time to clean and maintain but yet I need the sports facilities. Condo suits me just fine, and I chat with neighbours at gym and pool to keep loneliness at bay.  
 
If you love gardening, or have kids that need a play area, or love dogs, you owe it to yourself to live in landed at least for a few years of your life. But as get older, living in landed becomes a liability. Many things will break down. From windows to alarm to air-con to water pump to the gate motor.
 
Just my sharing.

You are certainly born with a silver spoon unlike many. My parents supported me up to my basic university education and that was it. Like many,  I had to work my way from hdb to private pty using my own savings from work and have not received a cent from my parents for anything since I left school.

You are wrong. I worked few years and saved my way to uni after poly. No funds from parents as they could not afford it. They were paying my elder sister's fees to medical school. I was a mature student in uni. LOL. This was back in late 70s when there were no financial instruments to unlock cash from assets. 
 
I could afford my first property, because it was bought during a recession and condos were the in thing. Old landed were cheap then compared to condos as landed supply was plentiful. Today it is the reverse.

Good sharing, I used to stay in a landed after upgrading from HDB during one of those deep recessions, downgraded to condo for family bonding (my kids can no longer escape my nagging these days) and it didn’t make sense to have a significant portion of my capital tied up in a house after a huge run up in property prices. Yes, I am a bean counter. I probably won’t go back to landed unless it is a one storey bungalow, which I can’t afford anyway.  I prefer high rise living these days, freaking windy and I have lots of great neighbours and best of all, I don’t have to climb stairs just to get to my fridge.  Think I have put on a lot of weight these days.  
I might downgraded to HDB if it means more money for me during retirement years.

One of my ex-staff also had the same experience. 16 years old told to go out and make your own living including living expenses. She had to pay many thousands dollars more for her lasalle education cos no longer subsidised. Going poly would have cost her another 20+k so she couldn't afford.
But Leaves religion aside, dis lady still the champion. Ms Judith Halim. Go watch her in youtube...

You are wrong. I worked few years and saved my way to uni after poly. No funds from parents as they could not afford it. They were paying my elder sister's fees to medical school. I was a mature student in uni. LOL. This was back in late 70s when there were no financial instruments to unlock cash from assets. 
 
I could afford my first property, because it was bought during a recession and condos were the in thing. Old landed were cheap then compared to condos as landed supply was plentiful. Today it is the reverse.
Love your posts, much words of wisdom and always with good sharing of your experience and knowledge.  I am sure you don't need a silver spoon to do well in life.

Last time people who started without anything can truly retire at 55yrs old with their homes fully paid, childrens education settled.
 
Today?
20 yrs later?

I realise this thread is coming to 10 year old, anyone who has bought a property then would have been huat by now. And i wonder 10 years later, in retrospective would we feel the same or should one just take a plunge to buy one now ?

The formula is very very very simple.
Confirm sure win.
 
Buy for long term no problem
just make sure your pocket can tong
 
If bought landed in 2007/08 sure huat becos landed was still cheap then.
Those who bought condos 10yrs ago may still be bleeding today.

Form a larger angle perspective.
 
If everyone retires at 55, what will happen to the country whose only resource is human capital? 
 
From the reverse angle, what are the holistic policies that Govt will adopt to keep people working as long as they are healthy?
 
When one understands both these angles comprehensively, the keys to retirement by 55 will be made clear. It's actually by choice and not compulsion.

To your question 1, the govt simply cannot afford to feed/fund the 30 years for each retiree's expected lifespan after retirement at 55.  I would say at most 15 years.  Especially with such dismal returns from TH and GIC.
 
To question 2, making housings, rents, transport, cars, water, utilities and most things expensive is one way to compel people to retire later (thus requiring less resources from the govt for a shorter retirement), since they would not be able to save enough but spend most on their salary on goods/services that are artificially inflated in prices.  People will have no option to retire at 55, since they would still have mortgage, loan to pay and no savings.
 
Thus your last statement should read to work beyond 55 is actually by compulsion, not by choice.
 
Of course I am referring to the masses, not the lucky top 10-20 percent who have the real choice of retiring anytime....

The keyword here is home.
Having options is always the privilege that we work for.
I, like you, would love options.
But to have to leave Singapore to retire becos the cost is too high in my own country is ridiculous, bro.
 
For some, this is reality. Its pretty sad, if you ask me.

Sharing the historical Psf prices for GCBs.
 
From 2005 to 2016, it is a CAGR growth of 12%!
 
One thing puzzles me. In terms of Psf, usually terraced houses (having smaller land size) are priced higher than semi-d. 
 
Why does that not happen for detached houses and GCBs?

not true for some of the people, but I take it that your focus is to buy the best that money can buy and serve the longest loan with no forward planning for a bigger returns from investment ?

Depends on what you buy and when you bought.
 
My first loan fully paid off before 30 years old.
 
If I did not stretch for the third, would also have paid off the second loan as well before 40 years old. Only referring to local.

Some people plan is to stretch the max with the hope they can sell off the house for a tidy profit when they retire to fund their retirement.
 
The other reason is that their kids may be young at that time and might need more rooms. Eventually, when all got married, they can downgrade to a smaller one and the difference is the retirement fund.

The key word of this thread is "to stay". My thought is since it is for own stay, the investment consideration becomes secondary though it is still important, the question for buying a landed to stay  will then be when is the right  time instead of when is the good time. Right time meaning when one has the needs, or the desire and yet has the means to finance the property. In fact if one has a need to have more than 4 bedrooms or even 4 beds, and like to have big space, the $ per psf of landed is a lot cheaper than condos, of course there is no security guards, swimming pool and other facilities. It depends on individual's preference.

Just to chip in some comments on buying landed.
 
The landed segment is one of the most depressed segment over the last few years. Last year I was helping clients to identify and buy those good value landed properties which I feel has a lot of hidden value.
 
Today, it is a bit harder to find, but there are still plenty of good value landed out there. The fact that only Singaporean can buy has sort of curb a certain demand. However, the trend of increasing demand for landed is on the rise again, and the demand came also from enbloc owners, who wants back the size but at a reasonable $psf.
 
When buying landed, I feel that finding value is just a small part of the equation, the bigger issue is to make sure the land is correct and so on.  I have came across cases there the land is actually splitted into two but not clearly known during the offering stage. Fortunately, through due diligence of the agent, that was found out before an offer was made. There are also cases where a newly rebuilt on sale has TOP but no CSC yet.  It will not be easy for a buyer to tackle these issues. I find many buyers only talk about finding value and bargains, but they forgotten that landed has more elements than just that.

 this is a major financial decision, i figured that this would be a gd place to get some serious insights..
Am considering upgrading from hdb to private in abt 1-2yrs for own stay.
 
Assuming all 3 property options are freehold..
 
 
1. Price
Landed - highest price.
Strata landed - not that high compared to landed..
For example, a yet to TOP place is advertised as 2.5mil for 3000+sqft
Condo - most affordable compared to the rest.
 
Will be able to afford a condo comfortably. If we get a landed/strata landed, it is possible as well, but of course a much higher drain on resources over the nxt 20+yrs.
 
If we get a landed/strata landed, budgeting abt 2.5mil.
If we get a condo, budgeting abt 1.5mil.
 
 
2. Value over time
I assume that landed property will hold its value the best in long run, due to limited supply.
Strata landed, maybe not so much, because we dont actually own the land, but just a strata title.
N also, prospective buyers cant make changes to the facade of the house.
So we lose out on the market of rich buyers who buy a landed, with intentions of building up their dream home.
 
For condo, there is going to be a increasing supply of condo units on the secondary market over time. While i believe the value will appreciate in the long run, maybe 20-30yrs later it may be quite hard to sell a condo unit due to oversupply?
 
Also, strata landed and condos may have the chance for enbloc sale.. Does this necessarily mean a windfall for owners?
 
 
3. Maintenance
Heard that landed homes are a pain to maintain.. Leaking roofs, peeling paint, etcetc.. (What else, pls add on!)
How much will the maintenance of a typical landed cost?
 
Strata landed, pay and forget. Just like condo. Right? The estate is supposed to take care of everything for u.
Maintenance fees about $500 per month? 
Downside is that u will be paying for the maintenance of facilities that u dont use most of the time like swimming pool, tennis courts, function room etc.
 
_____________________
 
 
Am currently caught between the 3 options..
To break the bank or not?
Is it worth it in the long run?
Will staying in a landed be just a dream that in reality is a hassle to upkeep in terms of maintenance and $$?

Roger, this is a great question.  I get this question from time to time from my real estate clients so hopefully my comments below will be helpful.
 
For anyone who is thinking of upgrade, you need to ask first that for the next 5-10 years, what is the lifestyle that you hope to achieve for your family? The answer will really depends where the buyer is now, not just financially but also his family profile.  In most cases, I usually see this :
 
> Upgrade to condo : Often due to proximity to kids' school and wanted facilities for their kids. Their children is typically younger so proximity and facilities are important for them. 
 
>Upgrade to landed : Often for the purpose of legacy and investment value,  children are older, do not wish to pay for facilities.  People who buy landed doesn't care about en-bloc because their bigger priority is to have something to pass down to their next generation.
 
From my interaction with buyers, I feel that most (hdb and condo owners)  ultimately wants a landed if they can ever afford it.  Imo, landed is the birthright of Singaporeans (and not HDB!) and has a certain prestige and exclusiveness to it.  Value-wise, it is like a gold standard of property investment in Singapore.
 
Now how about strata landed? I feel that strata landed is like in between ...it can be a choice for some especially if they want to get a feel of landed living without sacrificing the facilities. However,  take note also that repair and maintenance to your house may not always be from MCST funds and really depends on that MCST itself.  I have cases where the 1st waterproofing of the roof was done by MCST, but subsequent ones was paid by the owner himself. 
 
End of the day, the choice for condo, strata landed and landed will really depends on lifestyle choices. Do you want something near to MRT, has facilities for your children and guest, like high floor views,  etc? Or do you want prestige, strong investment value, owning a piece of land and property in Singapore at the expense of facilities and proximity to MRT?
 
The answer to your lifestyle choice in 5-10 years time will be your answer whether you should upgrade to condo or landed now. If landed is ultimately what you want but affordability  is too stretch, then go for strata landed first.  But if great facilities is what you yearn for, then only condo can offer that.......

Simple decision.
 
Based on what you wrote only one choice.
 
Landed has all the benefits. The small problem is most people cannot afford it. So if you can go for it.
 
As for maintenance you always pay for it whether it's landed, strata of condo.
 
Some people think get married no need to pay for sex. All I can say is I have not stopped paying.

Put it in a simpler way.
 
Buy a landed for 5m today and stay for 10 years you can definitely sell for 5m in 10 years.
 
If you sell for 6,7,8 million the difference will cover the maintenance.
 

Property pays for itself in Singapore so you always stay for free unless you rent.
 
Just like Chinese wedding dinner it's pays for itself.
 
At worse you make a small loss, at best can make a small profit.

Should not be an issue for me. I doubt my landed expenses will be that high

If the landed appreciated by more than $18k
 
over 5 years it would have paid for the maintenance.

At age 55, most of us will still be servicing our housing loan. No option to retire.Are you sure? Many people i know have fully paid an hdb flat by that age. Actually it depends on how much a person wants to stretch. You can choose to live in an expensive condo n still be in debt or move to an hdb with no debt.

If at 55 one is still paying off his hdb flat that means he had bitten off more than what he could chew! when you have deep pockets, there will nv be a bad time....  i see many having deep pockets having bad time and usually its personal problems that is difficult to solve.....can even be plastered in the msm for everyone to digest! The big case recently debated is 1 example!

this is a major financial decision, i figured that this would be a gd place to get some serious insights..
Am considering upgrading from hdb to private in abt 1-2yrs for own stay.
 
Assuming all 3 property options are freehold..
 
 
1. Price
Landed - highest price.
Strata landed - not that high compared to landed..
For example, a yet to TOP place is advertised as 2.5mil for 3000+sqft
Condo - most affordable compared to the rest.
 
Will be able to afford a condo comfortably. If we get a landed/strata landed, it is possible as well, but of course a much higher drain on resources over the nxt 20+yrs.
 
If we get a landed/strata landed, budgeting abt 2.5mil.
If we get a condo, budgeting abt 1.5mil.
 
 
2. Value over time
I assume that landed property will hold its value the best in long run, due to limited supply.
Strata landed, maybe not so much, because we dont actually own the land, but just a strata title.
N also, prospective buyers cant make changes to the facade of the house.
So we lose out on the market of rich buyers who buy a landed, with intentions of building up their dream home.
 
For condo, there is going to be a increasing supply of condo units on the secondary market over time. While i believe the value will appreciate in the long run, maybe 20-30yrs later it may be quite hard to sell a condo unit due to oversupply?
 
Also, strata landed and condos may have the chance for enbloc sale.. Does this necessarily mean a windfall for owners?
 
 
3. Maintenance
Heard that landed homes are a pain to maintain.. Leaking roofs, peeling paint, etcetc.. (What else, pls add on!)
How much will the maintenance of a typical landed cost?
 
Strata landed, pay and forget. Just like condo. Right? The estate is supposed to take care of everything for u.
Maintenance fees about $500 per month? 
Downside is that u will be paying for the maintenance of facilities that u dont use most of the time like swimming pool, tennis courts, function room etc.
 
_____________________
 
 
Am currently caught between the 3 options..
To break the bank or not?
Is it worth it in the long run?
Will staying in a landed be just a dream that in reality is a hassle to upkeep in terms of maintenance and $$?
Landed maintenance is not as high as many expect but you pay more to the bank if you have to finance with high debt. $1m more in debt will set you back by around $2k a month just for interest payment.   
If you can't clear your housing debt for your primary residence 40 years old, you can't afford it lah. Hard truths.
 
ok...leaks are however a pain to fix.

Simple decision.
 
Based on what you wrote only one choice.
 
Landed has all the benefits. The small problem is most people cannot afford it. So if you can go for it.
 
As for maintenance you always pay for it whether it's landed, strata of condo.
 
Some people think get married no need to pay for sex. All I can say is I have not stopped paying.
 

Cos you bought the whole cow instead of only milk... LOL

Want landed lifestyle just rent and put the cash in investments with 5 percent yield.
 
No maintenance headaches. No outstanding loan. No stamp duties to pay to pappies. And free to move to near where your kids study or where you work.  Or when you start disliking your neighbours.

Actually people who buy properties are not thinking life will be rosy.
 
It’s the reverse. 
 
They have no confidence in the future value of money ie SGD.
 
People who can’t be bothered about asset prices are very secure about their future plans with or without the private properties. They believe in a very predictable future whichever trajectory it is in.

Pricewise is diff to say. For landed, many considerations.  since buying to stay, satisfy yourself most important.  
 
construction costs are 20-25% higher than a yr ago.  i'm doing my place now so i can feel the pain.  make sure you set aside some money for such works.
 Best

My folks thinking about purchasing a landed (F/H) property now (to stay). It's about 980K. Land size 1300 sqft, built up about 1500 sqft. Is it wise for them to get it now? Is the price okay?
 
Thanks. 

 
Hope they bought it.  
 
Today for 980k can only get a 2 bedroom 99 year condo
 
in woodleigh.

The amazing thing is if one assume that 20k income will be there forever until retirement, some more maybe got upside. People are just cherry picking what to believe or plan. Even if property is a hedge against inflation, problem is can you last the 30 year journey to pay it off. It is the liquidity in-between that matters. For that liquidity, it means no options for rest of one's working life but to ensure you jolly well keep your rice bowl. The "tiredness" of this reality will set in usually when one hit midlife.

2 mil house is about 7k per month @ 1.6mil loan/3.5% interest.
 
Still got 13k left over leh. If cannot survive on 13k per month then I will be dead already  
 
Of course, there is also a big difference between someone making 20k in their 20s and someone making 20k in their 50s.

The purpose is for your own stay, as long as the house meets your expectation yet within your budget, why not? though price of landed has chalked up.

some concerned bro asked me whether i can hack it given that rental is 10-12k in those areas.   But a quick search in pptyguru showed up a number of decent options under 7k      
 
rental in D1/D2 should be more or less able to offset the rental.but need to factor in agent's commissions, taxes, condo's maintenance fees, potential vacancy, but if there is an upturn in the market, price and rental in D1/2 should at least keep pace with D10 landed?

Truth is that you can't survive on 13k per month (more like you don't have to). 
But for someone with family income below 13k, he has to survive on less than 13k per month

Then for that someone, he better know how to spend whatever money he has, wisely
Better not be going around spending like he is making $13k per day.

Most likely not true currently.
 
Most who walk in now are sitting on huge cash profits from enbloc, excluding the amounts they already paid for the enbloc property.
 
The amounts are most likely in multiples of millions. Maybe 50% will have at least 1 million deployable cash to play with.
 
For some, the 1 mil is set aside only for housing - they have other amounts for other types of investments. It is not right to belittle them.

Many scarify for the 'upgrade' to condo without realizing the trade off. I have come across many that pushed themselves beyond the limit just because their HDB can cover the initial payment. The sudden 'additional' gain makes them think they are now in the next level.
 
Think again, if you cash out and stretch yourself to the limit, what happen if one or 2 party lose their job? The worse is, this usually happen when the market is in depression and affects the property price. Is that 'upgrade' that important? I just hope the bubble will not burst. The last time was quite a while and most would have forgotten and too young to know

how nice if we can encash the 'dislikes' 
I never get any,  most likely because my replies are too diplomatic

sorry if this has been asked before, for a 3M thereabouts budget (i.e. about 1M cash), would it make sense to buy two D1, D2 one bedroom apt and rent them out, and then rent a small D10 (holland/6 ave) landed terrace/semi D for own stay?Why not just put the 1m into a low risk 5 percent investment, giving you 50k a year to rent a 4k landed (yes you can find). No mortgage, no property tax, no maintenance, and you have about 10k or more each month to splurge on a M car or AMG? Furthermore you may not like landed lifestyle after a while. Rent to experience it first before committing long term. Prices are not going anywhere for next few years.

what does '3mil budget' mean?do u mean 1) u have 1mil cash on hand and want to buy properties worth 3mil, mean 2mil loan; or2) do u mean u have 1mil cash + 2mil other asset (eg gold bar) on hand and want to buy properties worth 3mil, mean $0 loanif its 1), i dont think is possible given the current restrictions on ltv tdsr, unless your income can support 60% tdsr, and provided u can pay the 12% absd on 2nd property, and enough cash for the down-payment for both 1st n 2nd propertiesif its 2), there are better ways to spend 3mil

if its 2, there are better ways to spend 3mil
 
 
 
I meant abt $1M+ cash which, if first property, can probably let you buy up to $3M+ thereabouts property.   
Or two $1M thereabouts property, one paying 25% down, another paying 55% down plus ABSD.  Roughly...

in that case 1mil not enough to leverage lah, 3mil is confirm overstretching
2mil maybe still possible 
 
for 3mil - say the 1st property is 2mil and 2nd property is 1mil
 
2mil 25% = 500k, loan 1.5m
1mil 55% = 550k, loan 0.45m
absd on 1mil is 120k , 500k+550k+120k already exceeded 1mil, havent even pay the 1-4% bsd yet
 
for 2mil - say both property is 1mil
1mil 25% = 250k, loan 750k
1mil 55% = 550k , loan 450k
absd on 1mil is 120k, total 250+550+120 = 900k, after pay 1-4% bsd for both properties, left nothing for agent commission, legal fee, renovation, etc etc

$3M would be one property- landed. Maybe lentor, upper Thomson, $1M down and borrow the rest, pay less towards nation building.

lentor area fh terrace 2000sqf is about 3mil
if u down payment 1mil borrow 2mil, the loan payment per month base on 20yr tenure and interest rate 2% is 10k pm 
every 1% increase in interest rate is 1k pm more for loan servicing 
for tdsr 60%, u need to be earning 17k pm for a 10k pm payment 
provided u do not have other loans eg car,  ctedit,  etc 
the 1mil dp does not include 1-4% bsd about 105k for 3mil property 
absd does not apply here 
legal fee about 3k
agent fee likely 0 for buyer
renovation can be 30k to 300k depending on condition of the house

Good good analysis 
$1mil is nothing nowadays.
With the prudent measures
 
Unless belong to MCF median, plse dont touch $3mil property with only $1mil cash
 
Wait become jobless like me (but not full cash like me)
Sure Confirm swollen swollen
 
Dont play play

if only 1mil on hand,  safer option is 2.5mil n below
but 2.5m terrace cant get 2000sqf fh land 
1600sqf maybe but ulu location and quite cramp can only park max 1 car
 
to play landed fh with good size 2000sqf above,  min 2mil on hand advisable

Depends on the type of landed
 
2000sft inter terrace is good size
3500sft semi d or corner terrace is good size
5000sft detach is good size
 
Also depends on how the land is cut
Some odd shape 
Some too narrow 
Big land also no point
 
Landed is a totally different ballgame.
 
But I am happy with my SengKang west 3 rm hdb....
Cannot afford all these properties you guys talking about.
Like machiam free one.
Just buy...

I come across this thread and some of the discussions bring back memories for me. Let me tell you my story...
 
I missed the early 2001 to 2007 uptrend because I was like most of you thinking whether the uptrend is real, will the market crash, will i lose my job and whether  i can afford and did the most dumb thing..pay  up my HDB property.  When the market went down in 2009. I told myself, this is probably the only chance in my life to upgrade. I went on search for landed and determined to buy, settle on my sixth house visit after two weekends. So I did the SAF - Sign and Forget. The rest is history...You realised  the time I bought my landed is the same the thread started in 2008. If I would comparing prices, I would be thinking why I paying the terrace for the same price of semi-D in 2004. 
 
If I were not to do what I did in 2009, I will still be the same until today, analyzing the market..regretting why I never do it...
 
The funny thing I realised when making big investment is not to consult too many people because you don't make money from herd thinking. The herd will tell you where the most will do but unfortunately if they are right, there will be only mostly rich people in the world!!

I don’t think it’s fair to judge whether the case is true. 
And many agents indeed also benefit from all kinds of private housing, especially in the past when income criteria was not so stringent. 
 
I will take whatever is posted at face value, including those who claim to sell at the peak in 2013, and discuss based on that. But it’s hard to trust the validity of the discussion when the person switches position of status all the time. For that person, the misrepresentation is much more serious and misleading.

Actually in 2009 is very different from 2018 or 2016 2015.
 
I also bought landed in 2009 but I am not encouraging people to buy now leh... for the simple reason, I won’t buy now... 
 
I have paid off quite a bit of my mortgage and during refinancing discussion, the bank ask me if I want to cash out and take a bigger loan cuz the valuation is much higher now.
 
I look at the interest rate, look at the rental yield, no matter how I look at it, the numbers don’t work out especially for a freehold property, the rental yield is close to 2% after deducting costs... not even enough to cover interest. 
 
I might as well buy Singapore savings bond....

EC and landed you both have, and still want to buy more?
 
Hehe bro, give others a chance lah.

I sold of my ec to buy landed in 2009 for own stay.
 
Actually, landed has Super poor yield so most people buy for own stay I Guess. If buying for own stay and you take a big loan, it is really not financially prudent. Honestly I am just Glad that the past 10 years of Low interest rates has made paying of the loan pretty painless. 
 
 Of course on hindsight, if I have kept the ec, it will probably make some money, but not a lot though. I take the middle path... I don’t bet heavily on one side.
 
Although I hope the prices fall now, I am still vested in a decent property which I am ok to spend the rest of my life in. Life is short, and I spend a lot of time at home, why squeeze into a 800sqft apartment?
 
Why worry if an interest rate spike will destroy my finances? To me interest rates spike to 4%, I am still ok. If it stays at 2%, no harm to me too. Of course I don’t make big if I Guess right but it is enough for me.

It is universal for landed to have super low rental yield whether it is in Sg or neighbouring countries. Hence, it never make sense to buy landed for rental unless you are super rich to stay vested in landed properties for its potential capital appreciation in the future.
 
I am staying at my landed and never think it is a form of investment as I will continue to live in it in my retirement days. I am thankful that I am able to purchase it at an affordable price and to retire comfortably without being lopsided asset rich, cash poor.

Luck..does play a role but it takes guts to execute.  Without guts, every opportunity can drop on your lap and you still take no action.
 
Why not 2013, 2014....no money..of course...
 
Anyway I paid up my landed and only recently manage to buy another investment unit last year because of TDSR.  
 
Everyone has to start posting somewhere. Have to give newbie a chance. Just sharing my experience on a discussion thread that interest me.
Ignorance, greed and a dash of stupidity and luck is very very often mistaken for guts too 
You joined a car forum and the first and only thing you post in is “property”?

Landed property is basically only open to Singaporeans 
It is our birthright.
So if you are Singaporean, please buy landed, at least one if you can.

Ok lor......
are you speaking of yourself 
aren'r you counting on the few ignorance greed  and a dash of stupidity when you try to sell lolex here
 
you ask another forummer why join a car forum and post in property
 
how about you just how often do you post on a car thread and how often you post on others e.g. watches
 
 
nothing personal 
 
please don't butter others up for your gain
 
don't come and boost your ego from others by flaunting your wealth among the poor
 
 
I live long enough to see many things and speak my mind just like you
 
 
in any case this is just a tcss forum  but more importantly don't cause others to suffer

in term of timing , anytime is a good time to buy as long as it is not at the peak of the cycle
applicable for landed, condo, hdb
 
in term of location, there are gems in ccr, rcr, ocr, there are also rubbish in ccr, rcr, ocr
depend on your own investment judgement, doesnt mean ccr sure earn
look out for convenience eg near mrt, near supermarket, near shopping mall, near recreational facilities, near parks, near nature, near expressways, near good schools, near hotels, near banks, near post office, near cinemas, near library, that should suffice
and try not to buy units that face main roads with cars motorbikes and buses roaring, or fighter planes flying above
in term of facing, dont buy facing direct west sun or you will stay in oven for 360days a year
applicable for landed, condo, hdb
 
in terms of financing , first property only need 25% downpayment , 2nd and subsequent is 55% , which also require 12% and above absd
and take note of your tdsr, is your monthly fixed income able to support the loan quantum?
an in-principle loan approval from the bank officer will answer all these financing queries

My kid (not yet 3 then) loved the place so we bought it. Had gone to view one in Bt Timah before that. He walked towards the kitchen, peered in, turned around and said, "Dad. Let's go outside." That was it -- we thanked the agent and went our way.

are you speaking of yourself
 
aren'r you counting on the few ignorance greed  and a dash of stupidity when you try to sell lolex here
 
you ask another forummer why join a car forum and post in property
 
how about you just how often do you post on a car thread and how often you post on others e.g. watches
 
 
nothing personal 
 
please don't butter others up for your gain
 
don't come and boost your ego from others by flaunting your wealth among the poor
 
 
I live long enough to see many things and speak my mind just like you
 
 
in any case this is just a tcss forum  but more importantly don't cause others to suffer
 
I am writing this because there are some who are not as strong willed like you

Their turnover could be in millions, unlike taxi drivers who convert physical hours to $$$.

I am greatly touched by his speech.  And have been trying to keep his message in mind.  What esp touches me was the part where he said all these things you have, you go to CNY show it to your relatives, no one is happy for you and it only creates envy, even hatre.  That is so true.

Just on this, if I knew the person well and I knew he word hard for his money I would think the person deserved every bit of it. I have a associate who has all the cool cars and house etc but he works really hard for his money. Flies out constantly but when he is in town organizes bbq's, gatherings and is always just a message away from help if needed, always a good friend and gracious host.
 
If I saw a super car on the street and complimented the owner and he is gracious about it I would feel he is well deserving, if he was aloof and a prick it would be a different matter of course. (ahem ferrari aunty for example)

mm...I for one don't really mind he died.
 
To be blunt I think he is really the kind of doctor I see so often and absolutely detest. Don't care for patient's well being, just want to squeeze as much money out of a sick person....
 
Good riddance.
 
One question, did he donate any of his fortune to charity? I googled but can't find anything... or he just talk and talk....
 
That is why I say rich better than poor. Even if you die, people put you in youtube. If a taxi driver die, and start saying the same thing about life, u think he will be on youtube?

so that can at least park 1 car
 
no lh99 for landed pls, and no land size below 1600sqf pls

Here’s The Salary You Need To Earn To Afford These Homes In Singapore
 
link - https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/salary-earn-afford-homes-singapore-234540919.html
 
 

 
Buying a home is one of the biggest and most important financial decisions we have to make in our lives. In addition to paying for a home that is within the top five to 10 most expensive real estate markets in the world, we will very likely have to take up a home loan that will stretch for the next 20 to 30 years of our lives.
This is why we need to be very mindful when it comes to working out our sums to ensure affordability in the long term when it comes to choosing a home we should buy. Of course, as people progress in their career and have a higher earning power, many may consider upgrading to homes in posher areas, with bigger floorspace or near better amenities. This usually also comes with a hefty price tag that requires careful planning.

this example shows the answer -  the longer you wait,  the more out of reach it becomes 
 
because as time pass,  you realise income growth is not catching up as fast as capital appreciation 
 
principals of yesteryears could afford gcb,  nowaday a principal buying gcb may kena cpib coffee

Bro, how do you qualify to buy HDB if you owns a landed property? You mean lease out your landed house and rent a HDB? Do you know landed property don't command good rent? Also, maintenance of landed house is much higher especially if you rent it out.

Ok let’s be pragmatic about it. 
Use of OA is for those who want to deploy cash elsewhere.
 
Those who love to accumulate OA, and those who like to transfer OA to SA are never stopped from using cash.
 
Just over $1000 a month for this example. A couple sharing pays $500+ each a month.
 
If still can’t afford, there are 200k and 100k options. As good as it gets...
 
Anyway, we are quite off track in topic already.

thats without factoring in bonuses...  30year bonuses....   
 
from what i hear 6k is below middle income ..... 

 
I thot 500K is only considered average income in the new measurement of middle income

How would you price a 999-yr landed property that was rebuilt 10 years ago?
 
Current Land Price + [built Up Area x Construction Cost of $300psf x Discount Factor]?

 
Bro ... to be honest ... it really depends if your're the buyer or the seller as both look at the price from different perspectives.
 
If you're the seller, where is the discount factor? You will want the max selling price for your property and thus quote to the buyer that you've spent $K on your reno.
 
If you're the buyer, the situation is very different. Firstly, I really don't care if you (as the seller) have spent $XK  on your reno as it may not suit my taste. Secondly, it has already been 10 years - did you change relay your electrical wiring system (usually lasts 20-25 years - I think!). When you rebuilt the house, the type of (for e.g.) sanitary wares, kitchen you have used for the house may not be of an acceptable standard to you etc etc.
 
At the end of the day, IMHO ... you should pay what you think is reasonable for the land / house structure and also consider how much you need to reno in the house you are potentially buying. If this is your dream house, you will pay over the odds. If it is a 50/50, offer something you think is reasonable and if the seller doesn't bite - walk away. If the house is in a dilapidated state - low ball the seller cos no one else will buy. In this current climate, it is about to turn into a buyer's market (I think). 
 
I am no guru but I have gone through the same process over the last 18 months ... previous owner stayed in for about 10 years did some reno not to my taste but agent told me spent $500K in reno etc etc. I gutted the house rewired, replumbed (house pipes approx 20 years) and repositioned the rooms etc etc.
 
And now I am about to move in but very very broke! Hahaha!

The house was actually 20+ years old and some of the pipes were leaking. Looking at the current climate ... I think this will be one and only house purchase cos I don't think I can afford anything else in future considering the ABSD + BSD approx 15-20%. Therefore, I am here for the long-term and I really do not want extensive reno in the next 10 years and I really do not want to go looking for the leak. To give myself peace of mind, I decided to replumb since I was going to reposition rooms, add a new toilet etc.

My Reno done almost 10 years ago. Contractor said will changing pipe but I think they did not.
 
I changed the roof tiles too. 
 
The only big issue I had was the drainage from my downstairs toilet which need mister muscle every other time. This was due to the fact that we blocked an water trap to make a bigger room downstairs

just went to an ex-neighbor's house warming on Sunday …
 
when we were next door neighbors, we were staying in 5 room and they were staying in 4 room HDB flat.
 
but when their business failed, they sold the 4rm and moved to a smaller unit in ghim moh.
 
then from there, they moved up to a condo in Tanah Merah, then back to a 5 room flat in Tampines, then upgraded to a 99year lease semi d in paya lebar.
 
last week, they had their latest house warming in their 3 storey freehold terrace in upper thomsom !!
 
…. and 20 years later, we are still in our 5 rm HDB flat ...

right ...there is nothing wrong with where we stay as long as we are happy
 
just that they were more daring and upgrading their houses as and when the opportunity arises.
 
my ex-boss was also like that …. from 2 room flat in ghim moh up to a semi-d in jalan angina laut.

Happy is one thing, investment is also impt. If u know how to invest in other stuff, then I Guess it is ok. 
I don’t buy stocks so paying off property loans with the excess money is useful.

My folks thinking about purchasing a landed (F/H) property now (to stay). It's about 980K. Land size 1300 sqft, built up about 1500 sqft. Is it wise for them to get it now? Is the price okay?
 
Thanks.  https://www.mycarforum.com/public/style_emoticons/#EMO_DIR#/gossip.gif
Today 980k can only get a 1+1 99 year leasehold new condo.

two side of the coin.
 
1. is moderation / risk averse
2. hedge and base on homework and instinct to invest.
 
On one hand, if things fall apart , you have savings for a rainy day
 
on the other, you have to refrain from changes and live within the confines of further downside.
 
No real answer and its always nice to have a spouse that thinks and work together to go down that  journey.

How would you price a 999-yr landed property that was rebuilt 10 years ago?
 
Current Land Price + [built Up Area x Construction Cost of $300psf x Discount Factor]?

that is a good guide but it is very difficult to compare landed property price that way. Every landed is different from one another,  no way you could compare price using a linear mathematical formula. What you could do is using the formula as a guide, keep viewing a lot of houses every weekend, after a while you would be more familiar with the pricing. Not to forget the price different from location to location as well.

Hi,
build up and build in are being used interchangeably most of the time, it includes all floor area such a car porch and terrace. The other term is GFA(gross floor area), which does not include car porch and unenclosed area, this is the measurement that will be used in the plot ratio calculation.

My 2-cent. Roof must do if yours is over 10 years. Once move in, replacement is major disruption. Of course those burried in item also better do now. Conceal wires, pipe, etc. Want to change stone flooring, bathrooms, better do it now too. Loose furnishings, anytime you like.

My humble advice is use reliable branded waterproofing material and not those unknown China brand.
 
The other thing is don't get sweet talked into installing solar panel water heater. You will regret in years to come.

For me, 2 key points to note. If it is a flat roof, dont make it too flat. Make sure you have good gradient to ensure no ponding. You are not doing some lab work that require leveling. As long as there is not water, there will be no leak. No matter what waterproofing, got ponding, it is a matter of when it will leak.
 
For pitch roof, the more joints the more problems. At least 30% slope and ensure secondary layer of insultation material is not punctured. If you could use aluminium sheet to overall beneath the roof tiles, 20 years no problem.

I used the slightly thick aluminum sheet for my roof. It cost a bit more but 6 years have passed, not a single leak.

Not everyone so lucky. When I got mine, the previous owner owned it for 13 years and still sold it at a loss and it was a forced sale by his bank. He was unlucky to have bought when property price was at a peak.
 
My plan has been to sell off mine when near retirement and buy a HDB or condo. No need such a big space anymore by then.

There is always 2 schools of thought. Condo if location is good, rental yield better thus value also goes up faster and enbloc. Landed if freehold or even 999, you are save as long as you are not over stretched with loan. Where to find more freehold land in tiny red dot to build you own home?

In my view, Landed is a priviledge that given by the government to sgprean. Because no foreign ownership is allowed, the proce of landed has been kept at a decent level. Otherwise it would have sky-rocketed long ago if foreign ownership is allowed. 
The $/sq ft of landed is cheapest comparing with condo of the same lease. No where else one can find that kind of $/sq ft if one is looking for big gross space, yet having a land title vs strata title like condos. 
Some may say landed has to take care of own maintenance cost, but that isn't really that much,  comparing with a cluster house of the same GFA, the cluster guy would have to pay a huge sum of maintenance  every month. 
 
The only draw back is landed start with some min price to have livable condition unit. My thought is 2.7m for small one to 4mil for a corner unit, semi D is even higher. If one does not need so big floor area, then by uying a landed would  tie down his cash which could otherwise be used for other investments like buying more condos for rent, shophouse, overseas investment etc.
In summary, if one could afford and needs a lot of floor area, landed is the cheapest option by $/sq ft.

I agree that its always a trade off in life. 
To me, life is not about just about making money (thats not to say that making money is unimportant)
However the following questions beckon......
How do we spend the money to balance our lives?
How do we use the money to gain happiness in the form of comfort and time saved.
How do we use the money to improve the life experiences of first and foremost our loved ones
 
No it also isnt about YOLO.
But the truth is that life is short and we all have basically only one go at it.  
Finding that balance is really not easy
Acheiving that balance is even more difficult.
 
So for me to own and live in a house that i can truly afford (whether i need the space or not) instead of just thinking about how much money i can make by renting it out is more worthwhile.   
 
The true value of money is gain only when you spend it

Actually HDB are pretty decent but just did not justify it's current cost. For those that just like to splash 'a little' more to pamper themselves, there is this selection between condo and landed.
 
They both have their pros and cons. As you get older and children moves out, your needs and requirements changed. Then it is time to review again. Whichever you have choosen, as lo g as you paln to stay, choose one that suit your lifestyle.

For roof I used Sika waterproofing products.
 
My humble advice is use reliable branded waterproofing material and not those unknown China brand.
 
The other thing is don't get sweet talked into installing solar panel water heater. You will regret in years to come.

 
yup, those cheapo ones is a good product to use for car doors sound proofing.

So far for me, my landed holds value much better in the long run,. Bad times also can sell at a reasonble price
 
I'll have to agree with that though other aspects not soo good e.g. rental yield cos for the price you pay for landed one can get 2 Condos with much higher rental yields.
 
I see landed as my retirement fund ... I am not a big stock and share kind of guy (just got my fingers AND toes - all 10 of them burnt by Ms Olivia Lum). When I retire, I'll likely sell and downgrade.

There many out there in the same situation as you and they still didn't make it. So, beside yourself, it is still 'luck'. Of course if you choose to do nothing and wait for luck, the day is still young. Haha

I have a friend who just bought a landed at age 49 years old and taking loans to realize his dreams of staying in a landed. Sold his condo. I wish I am as brave as him.

Maybe he sold his condo for $4mil and used it for a Landed.
One for one, or maybe a small loan, ok lah, Bro
Don't think it is a big loan but the leverage has definitely went up.  I think he is expecting to work another 10 years to pay down the loan but i think he has a good job and i am sure he has done his maths. He doesn't believe in financial instruments, so his primary residence is also his biggest investment asset.

My folks thinking about purchasing a landed (F/H) property now (to stay). It's about 980K. Land size 1300 sqft, built up about 1500 sqft. Is it wise for them to get it now? Is the price okay?
 
Thanks. 

Yes, I think it would be a good time to purchase the price, due to the market downturn.

This is a very easy to maintain theme.
Since 2000 when off-form concrete was featured in many Japanese designs, i have fallen in love with the really cool style and raw feel.  So i have incorp this style into my new house.
 
The Modular cabinet system by USM is from Switzerland.  Also not cheap.

In my opinion, if you buy to stay, it would be better to buy the house, not the land. In addition, the re-sale house will be cheaper in this current market. Hope this help.

One mistake which people make is to take their primary residence as investment.
 
Yes sure, it can be sold when the time comes but at what price or should i say cost?
 
Just like a cow which you raise from a calf, even that is not easy to slaughter
Especially when you are not a farmer with loads of cows.
 
Similarly if you dont have many properties, selling the only primary one is not easy.
It become more of a last resort.
 
However, i also do beleive that he must have worked it out.
Whether it will eventually go in line with his calculations is another thing.

If wrong, he probably won't have to join one MCFer at Bedok reservoir, I guess.  
When younger, my primary residence was also part home, part investment.  Now I see it more as a consumption item as it is hard to liquidate.  Too old for that downgrade shit.  
 
I am actually quite curious how much of middle class SGeans networth (after adjusting for debt) are tied up in their primary residence, given the high property prices here.  Is 50% too much or it should be closer to 30%, which I read from some financial gurus is the right level.  Think 30% will be tough for many here, save for the elites and business owners.

Yes , i truly think that your estimation is definitely leaning towards the correct angle.
I would in fact, say that its higher than 50% for most.  The reason is probably, singaporeans take very big bites on Property and it is the easiest asset to leverage on. 
 
In my opinion 50% is quite a good balance in SG due to the high cost of properties yes.
In other countries i would believe that ihat would be closer to 25-30% for middle class.

My gut feel is at least 70%-80% or even more than 100% of net worth.
 
Let's say someone has a 1M property and 50% paid up leaving loan of 500k.  Plus cash in bank 100K, shares 200K, car 100K fully paid.  We don't count CPF as those are not liquid.  Net assets/worth would be 900K (1.4M - 0.5M),  
 
Property as a percentage of net worth 1M/900K = 111%
 
Unless the property is (almost) fully paid, it is likely to be more than 100% of net worth!

It depends on the age of the person also, as one gets older  , his risk appetite and financial position will be very different from a relatively younger person. The ratio will drop drastically towards    one's retirement age.

Not everyone so lucky. When I got mine, the previous owner owned it for 13 years and still sold it at a loss and it was a forced sale by his bank. He was unlucky to have bought when property price was at a peak.
 
My plan has been to sell off mine when near retirement and buy a HDB or condo. No need such a big space anymore by then.
My plan is to stay till I leave this world. Landed offers very big floor space , condo of the same floor space would cost a lot more and in fact wont find a condo of the same floor space. I want to have enough space when my grandchildren start visiting me during weekend or major occassions like new year or public holiday next time. Yes I may get money selling off landed, can even buy condos to rent out, but those money wont give me happiness, it is the family bonding, the family happiness that keeps me happy. I am the old style thinking type. 
And I want to borrow these quotes from T2.......

How do we use the money to improve the life experiences of first and foremost our loved ones?

Yup, if the primary residence is also paying for retirement as CPF accounts are totally drained, something has got to give? Maybe that is also why we have more and more asset rich folks asking for handouts, ie rebates, which is not right.

Property prices appreciate in due time so it is best to purchase while it's still being developed and within reasonable price. But it's price would depend certain factors such as location, accessibility, commercial development within the area and other factors. Here's an article about Property Auctions to give you an insight.
