$1600 for a freehold condo in a good area is a good buy.
 

Geylang MM now also asking for $1200 to $1600.

nah i mean far east condo = overpriced... haha... very overpriced... good condo(relatively) do not need to do so much advertisment...

look at atreasuretrove @ punggol at simlian... opp mrt and future mega mall.. price not as high as boathouse residence @ hougang which is freaking ulu ( i live in hg) ... atreasuretrove do not even advertise in newspaper and its 85% sold out in 2 week of launching...
 

u look at newspaper, alot fareast condo advertisment.. alot is launch for quite long liao but still alot unsold.. 
 

in my opinion, far east bid for too much land.. and with tat, i think they "can" drive up the selling price as they are like "half monopoly"

Far East Org business model was based on assumption that land price will always go up in the long run.  And they were right.
 

They have plots in Newton, River Valley, Upper Bukit Timah that they have sat on for more than 20, 30 years but never developed.
 

Even for those that they have developed and tried to sell at sky high prices, if nobody buys, they will just hold on and rent them out rather than drop price to sell. 10 years later sure can fetch much higher price. And they were right.
 

They are private company so they don't have to account to anybody.
 

Most developers will like to do this but because many are publicly listed, they cannot.  A developer's business is in buying land and renting/selling it.  If they have no land to buy or do not possess a land bank, they are out of business.
 

Moral of the story is: if you have deep pockets and high credit, it always makes more sense to hoard land, condos and be a landlord. This is because Singapore land is a finite resource. Buy high, sell higher.

The quality of their interior finishing is not good and most pple start having problems after 3 years. I don't know whether they have improved in the recent years.
 

However, their marketing is pretty good, and hence many pple know their projects.

hillview + upper bukit timah area are pretty undervalued at this pt.
 

where in SG can you still find FH apartments or 999 LH at sub-$1k psf. 
 

yes, some of the developments may be a bit old.. but at this price, you can take the differential of $100 psf and do up the house. 
 

once the downtown line opens, expect the prices to shoot cos lot of other developments will happen.

Other developments happen also means supply increase hence price will still be soft. Even softer if you compare old condo vs new condo in the area.
 

But if buying to stay, mai hiam lah, it is around the cheapest in SG already, for freehold.

Heard from the agent that the price is definitely lower than $1500 as there is early bird discount
 

Initially wanted to go down showroom but vvip launch postponed...
 

I look at this as a good investment. Although telok kuaru houses going for only $1100, there is no full fledged condo. They are all small dev. End of day, still depends on selling price. If price is good, might get a 2 bedder as investment with my friend. :)

Being looking for a while and talking and sussing the ground.
 

Realized that Hillview area got huge upside, as the existing condos there are still less than 1000psf.

The location is ulu....but the new MRT in three years time will be potential to push up the overall value in that area.

Too ex at 1600psf.

Use backside to feed the developers for the next 30years.

The world is changing very fast....every three years got major shift.....very scary to lock in a bank loan and worry for the rest of life till retirement.

Not worth it.
 

1000psf maybe can consider.

Think you need to get your numbers right! should be 600-700K++ for 105 SQM (meaning 105 x 10.76 = 1130sqft.
 

Hope you got the fact right?  In Singapore, those shoe box design range around 380 - 500 sqft, hence your 105 sqft is ???

D Leedon, district 10, with hundreds of unsold units, is available at 1500 psf or thereabout.  I thought the show just got more interesting as mass market prices is moving into prime territory.  
 

Also interesting is Sim Lian's Parc Vera's average price of 800 psf undercutting Boathouse's 890 psf, both are in the same area and not near any convneniences. Well, go in with your eyes opened as more supply enters the market.

but whatever price Capland is selling, the premium price (being near MRT) would have been priced in. 
 

Agents are recommeding me to find places of potential development e.g., Woodlands, Hillview...
 

but what if these developments did not materialize?

Just put the private buyer as your parents or kids name.

The worry is that they may play you out and claim for the unit.
 

There is no cheap way out. Even if you register the private under a business....also need $$$$.

Just lesser foreigners buying and FEO is hinting to tweaking the system.

This could be the prove that foreigners were indeed the main culprit pushing and creating the property bubble!!
 

When times was good, did FEO ask gov to tweak the system to benefit citizens to buy at cheaper price?

I have seen thru these big shot mentality....they are mostly MONEY minded and shameless.
 
 
 

Far East: Cooling measures need tweaking..so that they can earn more???
 

"Cooling measures may need tweaking, says Far East
 

The 10 percent additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) for foreigners is 'a very big number', according to Philip Ng, CEO at Far East Organization (pictured), noting that the recent property cooling measures may need to be calibrated, based on how persistently sales volumes drop.
 

Ng added that the cooling measures had prompted Far East and its partners to drop the prices for their soon-to-launch 992-unit Watertown project in Punggol Central, as foreigners have shown relatively less interest in the project compared to launches done prior to the cooling measures.
 

Consequently, the measures may eventually need tweaking, he said.
 

"Indeed, there could be some calibration or tiering perhaps, but that's something that has to be discussed with good data between developers and policymakers."
 

"At this point, it's pretty early days and you can see that there was already a drop in December," he said, referring to the 63 percent plunge in new private homes sales last month.
 

Ng said implementing the policy for a while will gauge whether the sales decline is persistent before finally deciding if the measures must indeed be tweaked.
 

In response to the ABSD, unit prices at Watertown were reduced by five to eight percent. Related Stories:Govt releases two residential sites for sale Kovan residential site draws 11 bidsS'pore home sales slow down as cooling measures bite."

The SOHO showroom only can be access from tonight onwards. Heard that they open till 3 am. 
 

But the discount is very attractive. based on the total discount they are willing to give is like more than 20%.

When buying a condo, don't just look at the developer,
 

must also look at the contractor,
 

usually its always the lowest bidder.
 

So can pay for brand name developer
 

and end up same contractor as cheaper

soho design is generally 'good to look at, not good to eat' ie impractical / gimmicky......  if you enjoy a cup of coffee/tea etc reading in bed, you will have to carry the cup up a steep 'ladder' (disguised as staircase) up the upper level 'bedroom' which is nothing more than a bed installed/suspended above your living room.....  when the wife is pregnant, she has to sleep downstair unless she wants to risk falling off the ladder.
 

if any bro has lived in a soho unit before, please feel free to agree/disagree....

They use the cheapest material. Don't touch anything built by them, even with a 10-foot pole.




Good advice

When buying a condo, don't just look at the developer,
 

must also look at the contractor,
 

usually its always the lowest bidder.
 

So can pay for brand name developer
 

and end up same contractor as cheaper
 

developments.
 





 
 

Heng my developer and contractor same same...so at least quality guaranteed (hope so)

soho design is generally 'good to look at, not good to eat' ie impractical / gimmicky......  if you enjoy a cup of coffee/tea etc reading in bed, you will have to carry the cup up a steep 'ladder' (disguised as staircase) up the upper level 'bedroom' which is nothing more than a bed installed/suspended above your living room.....  when the wife is pregnant, she has to sleep downstair unless she wants to risk falling off the ladder.
 

if any bro has lived in a soho unit before, please feel free to agree/disagree....



 
 

Yep..soho is something like the lotus desaru 1 bedroom unit...downstair living + kitchen, upstair bedroom/study etc
 

But beauty to the eye of the beholder...

Telok kurau is not considered good location. Historically not high price area.



 

thats right.
 

overcrowded and over developed with small private apartments (not real condos)
 
 

even in the past, when it was all landed homes, it was already quite densed and tight.
 
 

i mean if foreigners can be misinformed enough to pay that price, i'd understand.

but locals buy at that price in current situation?

we all know who would be laughing all the way to the Bank.

with all these new-gen shoebox condo flooding the market from now on, those who own old-gen condo ie with bigger rooms better stick to their current condo.... 10yrs from now, such bigger condo units will be in demand in the 2nd hand market.... expat tenants will still prefer bigger/normal size condos, not the shoeboxes...

I think they owe the banks big time.  If they collapse, so will the banks.  Therefore if they want more money, the bank also cannot say no.

FE is probably one of the biggest customers of SPH...  They are on a carefully planned campaign to push up market and revive interest but also aggressively selling off their projects at the same time.  I am sure if sales figure for Watertown is good, we will read about it in the papers soon, other small developers don't seems to have that type of influence.

The SOHO showroom only can be access from tonight onwards. Heard that they open till 3 am. 
 

But the discount is very attractive. based on the total discount they are willing to give is like more than 20%.



 

After the "hefty" discount, it is still a record price for residential property prices in Ponggol area.  Smart marketing.

Most developers, let alone FEO, are here to make money for themselves obviously. They will not stop at anything to convince us now is the time to buy.     SPH depends on them for advertisement revenue.  So, whose side you think SPH is with with regards to teling the truth on market directions??

I kid you not, from the vantage point of Watertown, all owners of high floor units overlooking the waterway can also see the container port, industrial estate and chimney from across the straits of Johor.  Not a pretty sight. Buy units below level 8 if you wanna skip these sights.

Of course the buyers will check the facts and discover the advert is a big distortion of facts. The point is not whether the buyers will be fooled, it's the way FEO feels it is perfectly alright to give wrong information as if the buyers are blind. 
 

Imagine a durians seller displaying a big banners showing nice looking durians when he is actually selling rotten ones right below the banners. 
 

Or in Hotel 81 room a naked guy walking towards his xmm lying on the bed and keeps telling her his didi is solid and strong when it actually is a downward pointing shrunken sauge between his legs right before her eyes.
