If you have the space do try an island kitchen concept, with the dining area in the centre. 
Definitely makes dining or entertaining more enjoyable! 
 
Fittings wise I used Salice hinges, drawers and those lifting drawer systems (I don't know the name). 
It's an Italian brand and my contractor claims it's the same quality as Blum but a lot cheaper. 
Initially wanted Blum but was convinced by the cost savings. I saved about 40% by using Salice. 
 
I purchased directly from Spaceweiss Solutions http://www.spaceweiss.com and my contractor did the rest. 
 
But if budget is not a problem, can check out the electronic kitchen equipment by Blum. Sky high expensive but very cool!

I have Blum soft close hinges. If u want blum drawers etc will be more expensive. Blum lift systems.
Personally i only got the soft close to prevent accidental injury to my child when the door closes shut. Otherwise seems bit overkill.
 
Most people probably using the Excel hinges i think. Hinges + their rack systems.
 
Hettich/Hafele are alternative ones. But don't think many people use them.

This 4-room flat's kitchen costs $68,000
By Jennifer Dhanaraj
The New Paper
Wednesday, Oct 16, 2013
 
She spent almost $68,000 on her kitchen - that is more than two-thirds of her $100,000 renovation bill.
 
Says Miss Wendy Chng, 41, director of sales at a logistics company: "I just want my home to look good, especially because I didn't have a say in what my house looked like when I was living with my parents."
 
The kitchen was an important element in her home and she spared no expense to make sure the look came out absolutely right.
 
"Money is not an issue, so I don't mind paying for quality," she says.
 
Among the pricey elements in there? A state of the art induction hob, oven and steamer from Küppersbusch and a fridge from Liebherr, which alone put her back about $40,000.
 
New to the world of appliances, she sought advice from Kitchen Culture, a high-end appliances specialist in Bukit Merah.
 
Kitchen Culture CEO Lim Wee Li tells us that Singaporeans are spending more on their kitchens as they have "developed specific tastes and are passionate about cooking".
 
"They want only the best quality appliances - ones that can be easily customised to the family's needs," says Mr Lim.
 
In Miss Chng's case, she chose the appliances for their looks.
 
"They fit with the black and white aesthetic of the house," says Miss Chng, who is single and a first-time property owner.
 
The appliances also encourage a healthier lifestyle for her.
 
She says: "I have an oven and a steamer so I won't be tempted to fry food all the time. Usually, I just steam it as it's better for me."
 
Yet, the frequent traveller admits that she hardly gets to use the kitchen and her busy schedule means she cooks instant noodles more often than gourmet meals.
 
But the lovely kitchen comes in useful for the occasional steamboat sessions that happen when her friends visit.
 
She says that she wanted to have a large work space which is afforded by her kitchen island.
 
"So I can eat while I work," she adds.
 
She doesn't regret spending a single cent of the huge amount and doesn't think of it as an extravagance.
 
"I travel very often, so I want to come back to my home and feel like I'm in a hotel room."
 

 

you can spend a lot but only to cook instant noodle

i think almost all brands come with soft close, definitely a must nowadays!
 
i will give excel a miss. used it before and had a bad experience with the quality.

old folks need only one old cheap wok bought from the market and they can cook up a delicious meal.
 
modern folks need stainless steel pans, pots, designer knives, non stick pans, grill, oven etc and mostly not half as delicious.

old traditional kitchen doesn't mean the design of 70s lah, could be something simple, rustic but functional is the key. Those branded stylist kitchen are more for show room effect, unless you keep it clean (usually dun cook), or you clean it after every cooking (clean as you go!).
 
A real chef enjoy washing up and cleaning up the kitchen as much as he cook

Wanted but didn't use them as they refused my business due to year end period.
 
It's more practical lor 'cos got modular system and sinks got those industrial looking type (deep enough for real washing). Lol...
 
Cabinets, etc also got raised legs for easy washing of kitchen floors.

I ever thought of before how my kitchen will look like if I was single. 1 portable induction cooker, 1 small multi purpose pot for cooking maggi mee or can soup. 1 microwave oven, 1 toaster oven, 1 small fridge, 1 sink, 2 cups and disposable utensils/cutlery. Perfect!

I've got the ikea "Udden" stainless steel console/worktop. Can fit cabinet or drawer module under, I got one of each. Useful thing and industrial looking which fits my house. Good if you've got extra space or need some storage/work area apart from the usual kitchen cabinets and countertop.
 
But the quality horrrr, errrmm the drawer handles came loose after two days so have to use glue to keep it secure.
 
But it's ikea *shrug*

Haha I have 2 portable induction cookers, keep in cabinet when not in use so kitchen looks neat, gas stove was junked and I got a new countertop installed.
 
I have 3 pots+2 big steamboat/shabu-shabu pots that came with the cookers, 3 frying pans and enough cutlery and crockery for 3 people to dine. Cutlery/crockery/utensils mostly from ikea including my chef/utility/vegetable knives.
 
Microwave, toaster, kettle all sit on the Udden console.
 
And my house always got the smell of frying bacon.

old flats don't need to do built-in wardrobe/cabinets 'cos space big enuff. Buy proper wood cabinets. Important is to get the wirings changed, pipes and sanitary equipment changed.
 
Old floor using marble and granite can also keep. Those were the days when they are thicker. Just need polishing.

Yeah unless you got some vision of a complete remake, work with what you have. It's suprising how a change of furniture and new colours can give a place new life without having to strip the whole house down to the bones first.

around $25K - $35K ($40K if you redo the whole kitchen from floor to wall and piping), get a few quote to compare.

Rewiring the house is easily 3-4k alone with the powerpoints. Maybe even more depending on how many points u want.
Kitchen and toilets will also a tidy sum. 
Repainting i would say about 1k+
 
I disagree. I think floor to ceiling cabinets are always worth the $. Just the effort over the years u spend cleaning the dusty tops will be worth the additional $ u pay. Not to mention the extra storage space.

agree. if want a more complete look, built in customised cabinets are the way to go. very hard to buy gam gam hor fit kind of cabinets in the market.
 
if i live in big landed property, then i won't bother with built in cabinets as i can easily place my loose pieces anywhere i want in a bigger area. but smaller areas like hdbs, i prefer built in.

i tell my wife before: those who buy condos on a budget will find that their domestic helper enjoy the condo the most cos the helper is at home 24x7 while you are slaving in your office from 7am to 10pm daily.

1) Hacking of 3 walls
2) Hacking of 2 toilet flooring and wall tiles
3) Hacking and removal of kitchen cabinets, build in 1 x wardrobes, sanitary fixtures, wall skirtings
4) Removal of debris
 
*no hacking on existing flooring except toilets.

1) Hacking of 3 walls - maybe $1500
2) Hacking of 2 toilet flooring and wall tiles -maybe $1500.. just hacking? Don't need to redo? Usually toilet is around $5-8000 plus water proofing, from raw to full.
3) Hacking and removal of kitchen cabinets, build in 1 x wardrobes, sanitary fixtures, wall skirtings -$1500 for hacking, for cabinet I think it's around $200/300 per feet, so depends on how big is your cabinet. Maybe another $1000 for the fixing of other stuff?
4) Removal of debris $500

Reno depends on individual preference. Price does not dictate if the end product will be to your own or other people liking. 
 
Went to some houses, 1200sqft, spent70-90k Reno... Designer that's featured in magazines. Some others same size and use some contractor and put in personal tough and cost 30+k... 
 
The cheaper one looks and feels much better actually.

can't agree more. Most people will be better off with simple design and reno 'cos after you moved in, it's all junks. What you see in magazines are modelled without actual living in, hence without the "mess". What is "mess"? Even a haversack, skool bag put around can be a mess to your designer flat. You need to keep everything inside cabinets, out of sight......... to maintain the look.
 
If I will to do it all over again, I will not even buy lightings. All I need is $2.50 bulb holders installed with bulbs screwed in. Easier for all people to DIY change bulbs too.

A nice new coat of paint and renovating the 1 or 2 areas you spend the most time in for a mini renovation.
 
If everyone gathers at the living room often, then focus the renovation there will be great.
If cooking is priority, then making it look and feel clean (and non-oily) can make daily life for the cook better 
If you have guests often, having a nice main door and gate will be pleasant.
 
If you work till very late then go home and don't really have time to be in the living room or cook...then renovate the bedroom and get a very comfortable bed, pillow and blanket. Few things can beat a good night's rest!

i think should be around that price, just bear in mind
 
1) does it include re-wiring entire house? makes sure u change those as well
2) does it include changing all water pumping?
3) Make sure the hacking includes other cost like QP/PE endorsement, additional works on stiffeners removal if any

some rewiring and got PE endorsement. Reno price moved down slightly compared to previous house when I renovated after I digged out the old quotes. As I recommended quite a few clients for the contractor, they agree to bring down the price quite alot.

since we are on reno topic, i seek advice from any bro who knows about hacking of wall with stiffener in HDB.
 
I understood that in order to remove stiffener, a QP need to endorse the works.
question now is,
 
1) what is the usual QP charges?
2) beside QP charges, is there any special tools or skill set required to remove the stiffener as compared to hacking normal walls?
3) does the QP need to supervise the works?

The stiffener is reinforcement steel bars? 
 
Thought wall with Reinforcement bars are usually load bearing and cannot be hacked.
 
My contractor says walls with R bars they can't hack.. needs to engage professional engineer to advice first.

yes, need PE/QP to endorse.
question is, once PE/QP endorsed that it can be hacked,
 
1) does this hacking work require special tools or skill set?
2) does PE/QP need to supervise the works?

don't think special tool needed and don't think the PE will be there to supervise. Think your HDB wall have Re Bar because it's most likely a prefabricated wall. Think HDB approval needed also.

Choose custum furniture:
 
Furniture shops aren't excessively enthused about offering unique seats and tables. So as opposed to purchase their end table at a crazy value, simply ask your inside planner to manufacture one. Typically, they can assemble something close, for about a large portion of the cost.

If you're good in stripping, strip it bare. Then, go Ikea and buy those kitchen cabinets.  
 
I actually like those free standing cabinet like: http://www.ikea.com/sg/en/catalog/categories/departments/kitchen/10794/
 
Like those with legs: http://www.ikea.com/sg/en/catalog/categories/departments/kitchen/10470/
 
Most contractors don't like to do with legs one. All lazy bums, use recycled sand and ceramic tiles to platform up.
 
They also have portable stainless steel sinks. Move house can move easily too. Save $$$

planning to do some minor renovation to my ageing flat, with the kitchen being one of the top priorities. 
 
anyone able to provide tips or experiences? i'm staying in an executive hdb in pasir ris so there's abit of kitchen space. 
 
what fittings did you guys used for your kitchen? blum / hafele?
 
thanks!

Do consider:-
No harm having a LED altar.
Auspicious design.
Environment non conducive to coachroah.
Glare-free illumination.
Filtered supply to Kitchen sink.
 
Do avoid:-
Inauspicious design.
Coachroah-friendly environment.
Glaring illuimination.
Open fire altar (burning candles).

i will give excel a miss. used it before and had a bad experience with the quality.

 
thanks, will ask my contractor and check salice out. 

 
haha i'm afraid i don't have the budget for that. nor am i insane enough to do so unless i strike singapore sweep. 
 
my mum and wife cook very frequently so it won't be a waste. 

sounds like a lot of work!

know a couple of folks who done kitchen swee swee. but all dun cook or dun know how to.
 
those i know who love cooking (and can cook well) dun seemed to bothered abt branded hinges, hoods, sinks n stuff as long as the kitchen is functional. 

Inauspcious ones can also be nice-looking for those ignorant about it. 
that's quite true. my aunt who cooks really well is sticking to her old wok . her kitchen feels like early 1990s. but her food is marvelous!
Kitchen for western food preparation not quite suitable for oriental meals preparation.

Wanted but didn't use them as they refused my business due to year end period.
 
It's more practical lor 'cos got modular system and sinks got those industrial looking type (deep enough for real washing). Lol...
 
Cabinets, etc also got raised legs for easy washing of kitchen floors.
 

Do watch out for any floor trap/waste pipe overhead, inside the kitchen. Any leakage/seepage from them could contaminated your yummy-yummy food. I reserved that space for washing machine only, when I renovated my previous kitchen (also update to latest food safety compliance).

 
Haha yea that's true. My grandma's kitchen never changed from the 70s till now, her food is still one of the best in my opinion :)
 
But oh well, the wife wants it. 

Some undocumented recipe = yummy-yummy.

old folks need only one old cheap wok bought from the market and they can cook up a delicious meal.
 
modern folks need stainless steel pans, pots, designer knives, non stick pans, grill, oven etc and mostly not half as delicious. 

The yummy-yummy cooking temperatures needed for different food preparation. Stainless steel has also got limitation. My solution is to use them for steaming (less differences).

Kitchen flooring to drain towards the floor trap.
I don't mind fiddling around in the kitchen and cooking for myself (bachelor style tambah anything inside), but I fookin hate the cleaning up after. Heng my kitchen small.
Easier to maintain smaller kitchen. 

 
I ever thought of before how my kitchen will look like if I was single. 1 portable induction cooker, 1 small multi purpose pot for cooking maggi mee or can soup. 1 microwave oven, 1 toaster oven, 1 small fridge, 1 sink, 2 cups and disposable utensils/cutlery. Perfect!

I toasted out my toaster oven after I found out that the coachroahes mostly invited by the residual fragance.

Then the typical answer sure come......WHY ONLY WOMEN!!!! MEN can also cook mah.
 
Wah lou aaaaaaa.........i'll put my last dollar on them saying this pharse. Sure win!!!

Personally I only let established company that's been in business for at least 5 years, and also registered with RADAC, do my house Reno. 
 
next thing is to get at least quotes from 3-5 of these more established companies. The project coordinator who I feel most dedicated to service my project and reasonable quote gets my job. 
 
 I don't always go for lowest quote.. 
 
And I don't use relative and friends' friends company.
And I avoid Reno firm that asked for more than 20% to start work as it means financially they are more tight.
 
All those who charge me extra to give me 3D rendering drawings will not get my $$ as well.
 
The last contractor I used, the final 15% payment I gotta chase the coordinator to collect the cheque from me and close case.

have u posted your job up on KLUJE website?

There's nothing wrong if the ceramic tiles are well laid initially. But let ur contractor check first...
 
Rewiring should be 3-4+k usually for 4-5 room flat. Depends on how many sockets u want to put up. Some contractors will bring down the price but pad it up in other parts of the quotation...

If old homogeneous tiles, better avoid overlay. Ceramic still can try your luck. But, if I am you, will hack away since it's 30 years old thing. Have a clean slate for peace of mind. Tiles may be non-living, but they need "breathing" space and fair usage too. If too long never "used", will have problems also.
 
Wiring also change since 30 years liao. Toilets consperm must change. 
 
Any built in cabinets also junk 'cos one by one piece by piece will drop off without prior notice.

Not necessary to hack if you can live with it. 
 
Hacking plus re-laying will set you back by approximately $3K upwards for 3 room flats (about 700 sgft, less toilets and kitchen)
 
Laminating over existing tiles will set you back for the same area almost the same price. Less durable though.
 
I would agree with those who advise you to hack and lay new tiles. Once and for all for the next 20 years at least.
 
As for electrical, you can count the points and get a rough guide, based on single gang per per pt (about $30 per piece) or multi gang, lighting points, air con switch and so forth. I can't really remember the cost, but this can be researched easily or through websites or a couple of phone calls. 
 
Not forgetting if you hack wall tiles in kitchen, you will have to replace the switches and probably the water and gas pipes. You may then want to consider re-running the water pipes for whole house. I was told copper pipes are better than stainless steel ones.

For eg. Your CCU (Circuit breaker box) material cost is about $100 using a reputable brand like hager.

Anyone tried weiken ID? Lee guo hwang advertisement one. How is the pricing and quality?
 
I'm gonna collect my BTO keys by March, so have been doing alot of research on renovation stuff.
 
From what i gather, the ID company is least of your concern. What is the most important is whether you like your ID and his/her experience. There are 3 main aspects when choosing ID.
 
First is the design mentality. This is very subjective, one man's poison is another man's meat. Important is your ID understand your needs and can translate them to something you like.
 
Second, he must be responsible and do proper project management during your renovation period. You get a half-f**ked ID who can't manage your reno, you're better off finding a general contractor and do the management yourself. If something goes wrong, he/she should be the one you call and get things right. You don't have to go down and speak to the contractor yourself.
 
Also, important to note that some ID don't like you to bring in your own carpenter to do things, (as they earn less profit margin), while some don't mind as long as you consult them on the colour of your carpentry so as not to deviate from the overall design colour scheme. The good ones will even help you manage their own contractors and your own contractor, cos they don't want to screw up their portfolio.
 
Lastly, workmanship. This is probably the only part which will be affected by your ID company. Because you will use their contractor, so if the contractor they engage has lousy workmanship, you'll suffer a few years down the road.

First is the design mentality. This is very subjective, one man's poison is another man's meat. Important is your ID understand your needs and can translate them to something you like.
 
Second, he must be responsible and do proper project management during your renovation period. You get a half-f**ked ID who can't manage your reno, you're better off finding a general contractor and do the management yourself. If something goes wrong, he/she should be the one you call and get things right. You don't have to go down and speak to the contractor yourself.
 
Also, important to note that some ID don't like you to bring in your own carpenter to do things, (as they earn less profit margin), while some don't mind as long as you consult them on the colour of your carpentry so as not to deviate from the overall design colour scheme. The good ones will even help you manage their own contractors and your own contractor, cos they don't want to screw up their portfolio.
 
Lastly, workmanship. This is probably the only part which will be affected by your ID company. Because you will use their contractor, so if the contractor they engage has lousy workmanship, you'll suffer a few years down the road.

Hi Shull,
 
If you dun mind, please also share with me your contacts and your selection of which ID or contractor.
 
Some ID charge GST some dun. Some giving 2 years warranty some 3 years. Some ID include electric some dun. Most ID do not have own labour to do the carpentry or tiling. Even in same ID company some designers have own preferred workers. Really hard to choose. 
 
Can the saving from engaging contractor be about 20% of the reno cost?

Well, i have signed the contract with an ID firm (a relatively large firm that does renovation for a couple of mediacorp artiste, you can go Google   ). 
 
Why i sign up is partly because the ID which I engage is very professional and can connect with me (which is important).
 
Compared to other 2 ID which i have personally went down to their office and discuss my ideas, 1 totally forgot about the follow up meeting AND whatever i've mentioned in the first meeting. Another one didn't bother to reply to my email after the first meeting.
 
Another reason is that their standard package covers all the basic necessities for a standard HDB flat, at a relatively reasonable price.
 
But IMO, it's better for me to wait out until my renovation has completed before I can give a full feedback and recommend him to you guys.
 
Nevertheless, if you guys still want his contact along with what's in the package, you can still PM me.

must be weiken.com. Mark Lee endorse one.
 
Been there last week for a quick quotation. so far so good. they are very friendly. but as of the workmanship, I am not too sure. But since such a big company, they probably wont do a slipshod work. Any complaint against them is very damaging.
 
Hence, my conclusion is that though its a bit more ex, but it sort of buying some assurance.
 
Still waiting for their final quotation to reach me.

I won't trust ads or what not. I only trust the person.
My ID u tell him once, he will remember 90-95% of what u said and he will ensure the guy on the ground knows what I want.
Some ID, u tell 3 times also no use one. In the end the worker on the ground is still one blur sotong. Only knows he's down here to do something.
 
Get someone personally recommended by someone u know (and not too overly popular).
If you go by ads or what not, same as taking a shot in the dark. Even Renotalk recommendations can be a double edged sword.
 
I appreciate my ID more after i see the frustration that my BIL had with his...

Hi Galantspeedz,
 
Thanks!, That's fast. 
 
Wow this is a really old Circular since 2005!
 
Anyway I'm looking at buying a small landed, around  land 1600sqf - 2500sqf inter or corner terrace. Not sure better to buy those new-built or land-only or in between. 
 
Thus looking at the different options as well as cost of A&A, Recon or rebuilt....so many terms until I blur.  And also the financing options and possibilities from bank.  Don't want to be caught with my pants down if I rebuild and then cost over-run have to find extra cash if bank do not loan....
 
Thus doing my research now.....

Thus doing my research now.....

 
i feel it is better to buy those house with old infrastructure then do A&A...
 
the quality of old infrastructure is very solid, sadly the same cannot be said about a new infrastructure....
 
personal opinion only
 
ultimately it also depends what you want in a house.... for me, presentable and practical is good enough.... some wants it sibei swee than likely has to reconstruct
 
the cost between A&A and reconstruct is also about double.. so you have to calculate how much additional space you will have if you do A&A or reconstruct... since A&A allow you 50% already
 
but note the additional 50% allowed is not based on current gfa .... but on the very very initial gfa..... if the house already is 50% extra gfa, then it means you cannot exceed current gfa
 
disclaimer: please do own research if what i say correct bo.... just in case i wrong..lol
 
financing wise i can't really help you.. paiseh

I used contractor and my own carpenter..
 
but designs wise not as pretty as ID-designed ones, of cause. Though it's cheaper still, and important for me cause who knows how designs fad will change in future.
 
but one thing I insisted was to NOT have open kitchen and also cove lightings - cleaning nightmare.

Many nice design is for show flat and if you have a family with kids, I suggest you think properly before fitting out your house. Safety and being practical is upmost important. Mirror, glass, sharp corner with many steps are things you want to avoid.

i suggest reading on different blogs that can give you different tips on different types of renovation. it always boils down to "how much will it cost me to renovate my house" and preparing for that is main goal - especially for new homeowners or those undergoing 1st time renovations. just read and study every detail so you can plan according to plan. 
 
Did a quick google and this blog comes up first. Pretty interesting post i must say: http://www.singsaver.com.sg/blog/5-cost-cutting-tips-home-renovations-in-singapore

I find the most expensive in reno is carpentry work. For carpentry work in kitchen cabinet, wardrobe, tv console and shoe cabinet, these few things alone will cost you a bomb already. Still have not include other things yet.

Do be careful with the selection of materials. Very often, architects and ID depend on suppliers and they hard sell their products.
 
Just look at some commercial buildings including MRT stations. Their granites look so badly stained whenever it rains. It is also so slippery that they got to add strips to prevent falling.
 
Granites are very hard but at the same time very porous. Knowing your product is equally important.

Ehh ask you all ah.
 
1. If i break down wall (non load-bearing of course) in my HDB, later if i want to sell must i build it up back to original layout again?
 
Never done it before but probably going to reno again soon.
 
2. HDB got any limit on how often we can renovate/do hacking work?
 
My last renovation was about 2.5 years ago when i got the keys and totally rebuilt the toilet before moving in.
 
If you got any advice kum siah in advance.

i dun think you need to reinstate the unit to the original form when you sell, i view a few flat that come in different configuration after hacking, can't demand the owner to reinstate before handover right?

There isn't any need to reinstate anything if it was permitted in the first place.
 
Usually the problems with HDB Clearance of the sale will come with unauthorised renovation works such as 
- changing external facade like windows (toilet ventilation fans)
- things done to structural walls
- things related to waterproofing of toilets for example moving the water pipes etc.

Ok since things are moving into the design finalisation and quotation haggling phase of my reno...
 
How much cheaper can i expect carpentry to be if i just need them to build an encasement+sliding doors instead of a full set of wardrobes/cabinets?
 
Am planning to using a modular wall-mount shelving system for all storage outside of the kitchen and just need to encase it to prevent dust buildup and add in some vertical dividers.

i did that for my wardrobes, ends up... only slightly cheaper and kinda wasted abit of space as the modular units do not take up the entire width of the wardrobe insides. 
 
mine use Ikea Stolmen for the insides

Yeahh they don't do Stolmen anymore, now it's Algot.
 
I have 2 x 4.1m lengths of wall to fill up with and prefer modular as we can reconfigure easier than if everything is built in by the carpenters. Ah well, even if don't save much it's still the preferred option.
 
Also need to figure out some kind of hidden workstation setup that i integrate into the cabinet.

Dark lines normally refers to the structural wall which cannot be hack at all. No point trying. 
 Only the thin lines can be hack as they just serves the function of partitioning.

Well, you got to look a bit further as floor plans are 2D. If there is a structural beam (an existing thick column at the top of the ceiling while below is just normal bricks thinner section), it may still be possible to hack the lower portion. Just that the thick column is a no no. Need do get a PE  to assess and submit a request to Hdb.

Brilliant source lighting at Joo Chiat. The owner is a nice, honest guy. Doesn't upsell and wants to understand your theme etc before suggesting. Call before you head down as he might be on site. 
Added bonus is the kuey, bak chang store opposite. Really, really good food. Parallel parking place only, just in case you are parallel parking phobic.
