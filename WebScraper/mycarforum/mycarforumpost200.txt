Was watching the Ch8 news.  Water in Yishun is smelly and rashes are formed on skin after the water has been used for bathing.
 

Any folks here affected?

I remember there was one guy who made a video of himself drinking a glass of water from the affected tap to convince the residents it was safe to drink.

The lock got properly installed anot? IIRC, they spent so much money to replace all the locks.   Maybe those latches come with screws exposed one (= can use screw driver to remove screws and gain access w/o breaking/tampering with locks).

I thought they just swapped the lock from one tank with another, to save cost.

Yup, i also heard the news saying that the water is safe to drink.  I suppose they must have run some tests before they can say something like that.

Even if tested "safe", who will dare to drink smelly water ? Urine is also "safe" for drinking.
