Isn't this how HDB sold their 2.6% interest rates to HDB buyers? non-adjustable unlike bank rates.
Should be commonly know that interest rates are adjustable every year, sometimes even quarterly.
 
POSB also sold it's loan product 10 years for 2.2% and remaining at prevailing interest rates.
 
At least the person was notified. Some banks don't even notify and when you ask them why, they will deny everything.

If it's interest rates that deals with LIBOR or SIBOR, will confirm be adjusted one.
Unless stated in T&C, will not be adjusted for X amount of years.

It's about the spread. If you take sign up for a 20yr home loan and the terms say 0.65%+3 mth sibor, it shd remain that way for the tenure of the home loan. So the effective rate will vary according to the 3 month sibor+0.65%.
 
The TS in that thread is kpkb abt his 0.65% being adjusted upwards unilaterally by the bank. 
 
If like that, sign loan contract for fxxk?

Yikes - my loan is under CB but I did not get the 0.65% spread so I might not be affected. (Hope not).
 
If this is true, then for my next renewal, I am going with another bank for sure even if their rates are slightly higher.

Isn't this the same type of clause the telcos tried to enforce when unilaterally adding a fee for 4G? I think they were forced to back down in the end.
 

 
In response to the recent announcement by StarHub to start charging SmartSurf customers who use their 4G service $2.14 a month from June 1, the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) has investigated the matter.
 
Today, 4G services do not support voice and SMS services; these services are delivered over the 3G network. IDA understands that M1, SingTel and StarHub have offered 4G services as part of their mobile data bundle promotion and have positioned them as value added services (“VAS”) in their promotional materials and service terms and conditions.
 
However, IDA notes that there is significant consumer confusion over the service plans they signed up for. Under the Telecoms Competition Code, telecoms operators must communicate key terms and conditions to customers prior to service sign-up. Telecoms operators should not change prices mid-way that affect customers with minimum term contracts, if they were not clear to customers upfront what those price changes might be.
 
IDA agrees that the mobile operators could have been done more at points-of-sale and customer interface channels to communicate their 4G VAS position to subscribers. IDA has clarified the matter with the three operators. All the operators have since decided not to change 4G service prices for existing customers with minimum term contracts.

 
Key question now is if MAS is willing to stand up and say something as well and if the regulations the banks have to obey have a similar clause as the telecoms competition code.

Good point bro! Forgot about the Telco issue. 
 
MAS should stand up otherwise we consumers will always be at the losing end in a heavily weighted contract in bank's favour which they can unilaterally impose anytime they wish. This really too much and I wouldn't have believe you if you've told me that bank changed the spread on an agreed housing loan. Let's see how this plays out cos IMO it's really unethical

Ok noted.
 
But then again, the thread itself also took note that in all the banks T&Cs, there is an overriding clause that allows the bank to adjust rates as long as they notify the consumer. So, is this clause exclusive to Singapore only? TS also signed on the contract knowingly.
 
The question can then also be, how to get the RM to lower the spread (if possible at all in mass market conditions)?

If the adjustment is made after the customers contractual duration(first 3 years), then customers can always find another bank to refinance. So don't think MAS will do anything.
 
This is always the reason why I don't believe in life insurance, the t&c already win liao lor.

It shd be within the period and that's why the customer jumped. Double whammy. Sibor up and bank pull this kind of stunt.  
But always the foreign bank like to chut stunt. Some time back, also got substandard chowtar bank offer home loan interest offset against deposit product, in the end they also shafted customer ass and pulled the product. 
 
In short, have some SG pride and don't be a slut and drop tour panties for the bank just because the bank drops it's own panties cos when the bank pulls its panties back up, the T&C will say your panties must continue staying down.

No choice, unless there is qe4. rates will slowly increase further and I believe all banks will follow suit on.  There is no other choice Because of bad decision in the past with all KPI pressure that they just give excuse that as long as it can hit target is good news. It's more deep then that man.   
Alan greenspan also now have deep concern in the USA economy.  
http://schiffgold.com/guest-commentaries/greenspan-poor-productivity-means-economy-trouble-video/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=guest&utm_content=schiffgold so you see, how will bank not raise rate to sustain, more to come man.
 
That is why I feel that sometimes those on the top that make bad decision especially banks, politicians, everyone will suffer. So Well.. Have no other choice man, just have to head on to make sure they get the message that they are heading the wrong direction especially the financial institution.  Unfortunately for the past few years they still feel things are under control. Luckily government step in and heavily monitor them, if not I cannot imagine their reckless because of cheap $ flowing in for the past few years.  Cheap $ not flowing in as much now as there is no qe4 yet, so sooner or later all will have to raise interest rate one leh.

Every long tenure housing loan has such a clause, the pressure to exercise the clause when funding and regulatory cost are inching up can be tremendous.  So pick a bank that will face the least of these pressures.  I always borrow from DBS or OCBC no matter how attractive Shitty Bank and its likes are quoting.  Also, such management decisions are made by people who lives here, wary of bad publicity, not by some arse sitting in London or New York looking at some cross border reports and making decision based on those numbers.

just sharing. for those buying HDB flats.  POSB as loan scheme where the interest is capped for 10 yrs at max 2.5%. cheaper than HDB loan @2.6%.
 
so for those taking short term loan. less than 10 yrs pay off the house. this is a great alternative.

This.
 
I believe if you read the fine legalese in most mortgage agreements, the banks have the final right to vary almost anything or pull the mortgage at any time.
 
Friends in the banking industry also told me, just go with local banks esp DBS/POSB since they have a more 'social obligation' due to gahmen links.
 
They all can screw us jialat jialat if they wanted to. Just that some are less likely to do it.

My brother-in-law also the exactly the same letter from citi bank last week. He signed the housing loan with
Citi in 2011 at sibor + 0.65%.He recieved a Citi letter last week stated the rate will revised to 0.85%. Guess
Citi must have done it across the board & affecting all existing customers.
 
Understabd someone has highlighted to MAS & newspaper but guess Citi has the legl right to revised it as
stated in the contract.... the next best thing we can do is to check out other banks, call re-financing?? If got
reasonable deal, can share share here lah. (ANZ hosuing loan @ 1.5% for 1st 2 yrs?).
 
Or may be just go with Citi 0.85% for a few months to observe how other banks do with their spread...b4 u
decide to switch bank.

I am with ANZ.
 
I went through the my loan T&C again, I didn't see a clause that allows them to reset the spread but there is a clause that puts a 0.1% floor to both the SOR and SIBOR which it reasonable to me.
 
ANZ current variable package is 0.98% (throughout the entire loan tenure)+ average of (3M SOR+3M SIBOR) or 0.98%+3M SOR.
 
Hypothetically:
If I am have a similar crap Citi package and
I am able to refinance after taking into consideration TDSR and
I intend to stick with the loan over the long term,
I'd switch to ANZ provided ANZ did not revise their clauses to include a similar one as Citi.
 
Because there is always a risk that Citi will jack up the spread again and again and again depending on that jackass sitting in Asia Sq who decides he needs to take the easy way out to hit his KPI by shafting customers in the ass by invoking that clause.
 
BOC also offers a similar type of loan but with a 1% spread (I am not sure if BOC has a similar clause as Citi) instead of 0.98% by ANZ.
 
But if I am on Citi's non-guaranteed fixed spread package and intend to repay the loan fully in 3 years, I'd switch to a 3yr fixed home loan for a peace of mind and certainty on my outlay for loan repayment.

I checked the hard copy of my loan T&C which was signed at the conveyance lawyer office.
 
That pdf copy you posted is different from my hard copy.

I am with ANZ.
 
I went through the my loan T&C again, I didn't see a clause that allows them to reset the spread but there is a clause that puts a 0.1% floor to both the SOR and SIBOR which it reasonable to me.
 
ANZ current variable package is 0.98% (throughout the entire loan tenure)+ average of (3M SOR+3M SIBOR) or 0.98%+3M SOR.
 
Hypothetically:
If I am have a similar crap Citi package and
I am able to refinance after taking into consideration TDSR and
I intend to stick with the loan over the long term,
I'd switch to ANZ provided ANZ did not revise their clauses to include a similar one as Citi.
 
Because there is always a risk that Citi will jack up the spread again and again and again depending on that jackass sitting in Asia Sq who decides he needs to take the easy way out to hit his KPI by shafting customers in the ass by invoking that clause.
 
BOC also offers a similar type of loan but with a 1% spread (I am not sure if BOC has a similar clause as Citi) instead of 0.98% by ANZ.
 
But if I am on Citi's non-guaranteed fixed spread package and intend to repay the loan fully in 3 years, I'd switch to a 3yr fixed home loan for a peace of mind and certainty on my outlay for loan repayment.
How about this clause?

Looks like a very unresonable clause that allows the bank to shaft your ass when they feel they are not making money.  
You gotta check with DBS on that. 
 
My T&C has a specific line referring to the lowest minimum rate which I think is bec SOR either went to 0% or even negative on a net basis for the bank.
 
It doesn't mention that they can alter the spread which is fixed at 0.95% (for my loan) for the entire tenure of the loan.

It is a standard clause and most banks have it, market practice lah.  Some banks even have a clause in their standard T&C stating the bank has total discretion to vary its standard T&C at any time by revising their standard T&C and posting it on their website.  
 
It is not even worth the paper it is written on.  LOL.

The jury is still out on whether they are gentleman bank or not. 
 
There are also other banks with such clauses but never invoke them.

Banks are playing cat and mouse game with credit card too. The recent voyage card from OCBC and optimum card from anz are crap.

And please also check if your hardcopy has another clause hidden somewhere saying to refer to some "general terms and conditions" or something to that effect.

actually , what is the fuss ?
 
the increase is 0.05 which work out still cheaper that any new loan ( fixed or floating) .
 
after the increase in SOR , it's still lower than 1.88 offer by posb.
 
Really not happy, then switch lor. But i dun see any other bank fare better in terms of $$. If you speaking of "principles". I dont believe its going to be different between foreign or local bank.
 
 
If you were with DBS, OCBC or UOB , chances are you probably paid more for the past years accummulated.
 
 
In any case, the interest rate will be going up was a given, 0.05 increase is very little compare to 0.3 increase on sibor /sor  rate.

The fuss is that the banks can suka suka change the interest rates.
 
Everyone already knows that SIBOR can fluctuate so that is a given but for the banks to change the spread as well is not reasonable because their profit is supposed to be included in the spread. Under current T&C, what's the point of a borrower doing any evaluation of the loan packages at all? If I evaluate and say that DBS is better than OCBC and then tomorrow DBS changes my spread and OCBC is better then how? Or DBS decides to charge 5% interest when the market rate is 1.6%? Under T&C, this is acceptable!
 
I can't change banks without a penalty right?

Well said and fully agreed. Customers know that SIBOR, SOR etc can fluctuate but no one or at least most did not know that banks could arbitrarily change their spread and its thanks to the internet that this awareness is known too all borrowers.
 
It's not a matter of 0.05% or whatever, it's the principle binding all contracts and also a case of customers being at the mercy of banks in a heavily loaded contract in bank's favour which is unfair practices IMO

Legally speaking, they can change it as it's provided for in the T&C.  No use crying over it. Not happy, complain louder but not here in MCF.  Go MAS, Case, MSM etc which I believe it's already been picked up by MSM.  let's see if there is any reaction or not but I feel nothing much will come out of it.
 
That's why in some less developed countries which I shall not name, they buy cars and properties with cold hard cash. It's so hard to convince the people to take financing....they just dun trust banks.

Isn't the CPF rate 2.6% at the moment?
 
Also, it isn't capped at 2.6%. CPF loan interest rate is linked to the CPF interest rates that you receive on your OA (currently at 2.5%). This rate is legislated to be at a min of 2.5% but it can be higher depending on prevailing interest rates.
 

The computed OA interest rate – derived from the major local banks’ interest rates from November 2014 to January 2015 – worked out to be 0.21 per cent per annum. As this was below the legislated minimum of 2.5 per cent per annum, the OA interest rate will be maintained at the minimum amount, the CPF Board said in a news release.
 

http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/cpf-interest-rates-to/1664252.html
 
Once saving rates go above 2.5%, the CPF loan interest rate will most likely always be lower than bank interest rates since banks are unlikely to give you more interest for deposits than they are charging for interest on loans. However, this still shows that your loan is by no means capped at 2.5%.

I know lah, it is a joke after his derivative/future piece.  haha..  
 
But If I use my CPF to fully or partially repay my commercial mortgage loan, I am at least partially hedged.  It is my money after all and I think it is now at 2.5%.   Even when interbank rate was at 3-4%, CPF OA was still paying 2.5%, so the risk of it going higher is quite manageable.  Think it is pegged to commercial deposit rates of the local banks, which will forever pay sucky deposit rate.

I bought an EC like three years ago and financed it with ANZ blended loan (one with part fixed rate and part SIBOR). However, with the rising of SIBOR, the interest rate increased to more than 2%! It was crazy and we refinanced it to a fixed package instead for the next two years at a much lower interest rate. We didn't want to do the banks searching ourselves so we went to our mortgage broker, ahlong.com. They actually consolidate our home loans together with our neighbours and negotiate with the banks for a lower rate on our behalf. All I know is they are not tied to any banks, which is better IMO.

That's because interest rates have been low for a very long time....
 
If bank rates go up, CPF rates will have to go up as well otherwise people will start to complain (rightfully) that the government is cheating us by forcing us to contribute to CPF and giving such a low interest rate.

guys, when you all say there are less than 2% fix rate packages, can you specify since when was that? or is it less than 2% only for first year?  Some fix rate loans has less than 2% for first year, but quickly goes up to 2% or even 2.6% by third year. Or are there other conditions attached (for e.g only new home purchases above $XX amount)?
 
Because currently,  a lot of variable loan packages out there are 0.7%/0.8% + 3 month sibor.  3 month sibor now is already 1.13% (increase from 0.46% in Jan 2015) . So most variable rate now should be around 1.83% or 1.93%.
 
Typically fix rate is higher than that especially under a rising interest rate environment. If there is a less than 2% fix rate (say fix for 3 years) package now, most people will not think twice by quickly refinancing it from variable to fix.
 
Hence, if there is indeed a less than 2% fix rate package (fix for 3 years) NOW,  applicable for re-financing and no minimum amount, please let us know.

No Fed rate lift-off: SOR plunges but Sibor dips just a bit
PUBLISHED OCT 13, 2015, 5:00 AM SGT
 
Interest rates for short-term commercial borrowing here have plunged over the past month, but home-owners are not getting as much reprieve as mortgage-linked rates have fallen only a fraction.
 
A reversal in emerging-market risk sentiment has extended the pullback in the three-month swap offer rate (SOR), which prices commercial loans, to below 1 per cent, a level not seen since Aug 6. SOR fell to 0.99194 per cent yesterday, down from 1.35631 per cent on Oct 2, and nearly 37 per cent lower than its highest point so far this year of 1.56409 per cent on Sept 8.
 
Short-term rates have been on a downtrend since last month when the US Federal Reserve again stayed its hand at raising rates for the first time in nearly a decade. They have fallen further since Oct 2 when a disappointing US non-farm payroll report pushed back expectations of a Fed funds rate liftoff. Dovish minutes of the Fed's September meeting released last week further solidified those expectations.

Low interest rates are here to stay
Noah Smith
PUBLISHED OCT 22, 2015, 5:00 AM SGT
 
Why are interest rates so low? For macroeconomists, this is one of the Big Questions in the world today.
 
Government bond rates are at or near record lows. So are corporate bond rates, including junk bonds. Even the cost of equity capital is at or near an all-time low for most businesses. Whether you're a government, a big corporation or a tiny start-up, it has never been cheaper to obtain capital.
 
Interest rates have been in decline since the early 1980s. For a while, that looked like a simple regression to the mean. The early 1980s saw central banks tighten a lot, driving up rates in an effort to rein in inflation. But the decline during the past 15 years or so - and especially since the financial crisis - goes way beyond a simple normalisation. Something unusual is happening.
 
 
 
That's worrying for macroeconomists, because it means old theories may be wrong. It's also worrying for central bankers because it constrains their actions (nominal interest rates can't be pushed below zero) even as it increases the uncertainty under which they are forced to make their decisions.
 
So why are rates so bizarrely low? Interest rates are set in markets, where borrowers meet lenders (broadly defined). Any explanation for falling rates must involve an increased desire to lend, a decreased desire to borrow, or both. One common theory is that central banks are responsible. This makes sense to most people, since we all hear that the US Federal Reserve, or the Bank of Japan, has a policy of holding interest rates near zero. But just because central banks are setting their rate targets at zero doesn't mean they have to work very hard to achieve that target.
 
There are reasons to think that central banks are not the big driver of low rates. First, it isn't just nominal rates that are historically low, but real inflation-adjusted rates too. Most economists believe real interest rates can't be affected by monetary policy for very long.
 
Second, most economists think that if central banks are holding rates below what private markets want, we should be seeing high inflation. We're not. And finally, the end of the Fed's bond-buying programme of quantitative easing seemed to have only a small effect.
 
So are low rates being driven by a savings glut? That was the famous hypothesis of former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke in 2005. The idea was that developing countries - for example, China - were saving more than they were investing, and that the excess capital was flowing into the United States, and lowering borrowing costs. Since the financial crisis, savings rates have risen in the US as well - households are squirrelling away more, and corporations are famously hoarding cash. The savings glut might have gone global.
 
Another reason for low rates - an underrated reason, I suspect - could come from the demand side of the equation. The desire to borrow money clearly seems low across the world. Households in the US and other countries that suffered a big housing bust have large overhangs of debt, and the crash showed them that debt was more dangerous than they had realised. Companies in Europe are clearly reluctant to borrow to invest, given the running political uncertainty surrounding the euro and the sovereign debts of countries such as Greece. That probably applies to Japan as well.
 
In addition, these rich countries have steeply declining populations, and shrinking domestic markets discourage companies from expanding. As for US companies, they may be holding back investment because of fears of weakness in export markets. China is slowing, and with it many other developing countries.
 
Another factor may be the recent wave of technological disruptions that make it harder for firms to plan ahead. Big investments require big bets, and in an era of massive disruption, no one knows which bets to place. And even as disruption is increasing, overall productivity is slowing.
 
So what will stem the tide of low interest rates? I wouldn't count on central banks to do the job. As long as private markets keep pushing rates down, central bankers are not going to risk causing recessions by trying to raise them. Nor are firms going to suddenly become brave and bold around the world.
 
There are some factors that may stop the downward slide. American households will eventually work off their debt overhang - already, the housing market is recovering. At the same time, China is also rebalancing towards a more consumption-based economy. That should do a bit to drain the savings glut, at least when
 
China's current sharp slowdown has run its course.
 
But long-term trends - declining global population growth and continued technological disruption - point to a very long period of low interest rates.

Good recap. Most of my friends and colleagues keep saying the feds are raising tax hikes and more to come. All run to fixed rates.
