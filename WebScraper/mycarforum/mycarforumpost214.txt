HDB to build BTO flats for singles
Joy Fang 

my paper 

Tuesday, Oct 16, 2012 

More Housing Board (HDB) flats are being built just for singles, revealed National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan in Parliament yesterday.
 

Mr Khaw said he had planned to wind down the rapid rollout of new Built-To-Order (BTO) flats of the past two years. With the Government looking into the possibility of allowing singles to purchase BTO flats, however, he has "deliberately ramped it up a little bit higher in order to cater for singles".
 

HDB said last month that the total supply of BTO flats this year will hit a record 27,000.
 

Mr Khaw said his ministry is still "mulling over" the exact number of flats for singles, as it is hard to determine how many units should be set aside.
 

Currently, singles can purchase only resale HDB flats, and they must be aged 35 and above before they can do so.
 

He said last month that even if singles were allowed to buy new flats, they would still face restrictions, such as not being allowed to sublet them. They would also be allowed to buy only smaller flats and have to be at least 35 years old.
 

He had said then that he was still garnering views and would unveil more details next year.
 

In a blog post on Sept 8, Mr Khaw said he needed to assess the demand from singles.
 

"The additional demand is unlikely to be small and if we misjudge, the interests of married couples, especially those with children, may be adversely affected," he wrote.
 

Mr Khaw told the House yesterday that the number of new flats each year has been meeting the demands of new families, in line with the 15,000 marriages involving Singapore citizens a year.
 

But there is additional demand from upgraders, downgraders and second-timers, he added.
 

He was responding to a question by Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Member of Parliament for Holland- Bukit Timah GRC, on whether there was an adequate supply to meet projected demand, and whether there will be a reserve of surplus flats to meet unanticipated demand.
 

In a written reply, Mr Khaw said that temporary occupation permits are expected to be issued for 11,300 flats this year.
 

This figure is expected to rise to 16,300 next year and 26,800 in 2014.
 

He also noted that, while the property market shows signs of stabilising, "we are not out of the woods yet".
 

With recent announcements of further monetary expansion in the United States and the euro zone, low interest rates are expected to persist, said Mr Khaw.
 

This could contribute to strong demand for residential property and "cause prices to rise beyond sustainable levels".
 

On the $1-million price tag for a Queenstown flat sold recently, he said it was an exception.
 

The unit is an executive flat on the 16th floor, "not your typical HDB flat", he said.
 

"In some HDB towns, there will be some of such units with unique characteristics, for which buyers are willing to pay way above market valuation."
 

The move to let singles buy BTO flats is welcomed by finance executive Eugene Chen.
 

"I want to be able to have my own life despite not having plans for marriage. Privacy and independence are also factors that drive me to have my own home," said Mr Chen, 27.
 

While he felt being restricted to buying a smaller unit was reasonable, he said the minimum age of 35 was too high.
 

"I would prefer to be able to lead my ideal lifestyle before that age," he added.

Think one of them needs to sell off their flat if 2 singles decided to get married. But so far they still have not implement the rules and policy for singles to buy BTO. Dont know whether would they really implement this policy or in the end just say say only?!

Actually both are Grads w abt 10 years working experience.They do have CPF.
 

But the thought of setting aside 2k mthly for the flat is daunting.Considering it is whole lifetime.
 

And asking for a resale 4 room only.
 

If only ceiling is adjusted.
 

But then the lesser will complaint then  [:p]

i was thinking about it and to me, it makes no sense to penalise couples who each own a BTO to sell one BTO off if they get married, doing so will just reduce the number of married couples.

Actually i think the RELATIVE prices of resale,new flats,salaries are not watched...monitored...handled...

whatever,properly.
 

That is why we have these scenarios.
 

If the not so rich are not able to live lives of luxuries,they should at least be able to live comfortably.
 

Surprised they ponder abt current fertility rates.
 

And if poor are not able to ,say, buy a car....or big house,they should at least be able to afford necessities for reasonable living.That include flats,food,clothing,good public transport,daily necessities.
 

More to be done.
 

We are talking about a developed country we so proud of.

If married, the couple must sell of both their single flat and apply for one bigger flat together. That should be the right thing to do.

if new flats sell cheaper, resale prices will slowly adjust down....
 

lot of ppl kpkb high price, but still buy, which in the process drive prices even higher.

If high, dun buy. dun be a sucker.... eventually we will run out of suckers and prices will adjust accordingly.
 
 

too bad khaw got his balls squeeze by the big developers liao....
 

until now still thinking of controlling supply. more sacred of over supply then under supply.

how many month only after announcing ramping up of supply. Flats not even built now he think about slowing the flow liao

scared prices drop too fast? never mind.... got rich singles to fill the gap...
 

Please remember CPF contribution rate will drop and you can fall sick/lose your job anytime

The incentive comes from finding love and able to share a flat with the person they loved, to set up a family together, forever!  
 

The incentive should not be just reaping profits from selling their singles flat or earning rental from it.

they can stay single for the rest of their lives if they value their flats more then their partner. 
 

singles really want to have their cake and eat it.  Let them buy BTO still not satisfied. All the caveats must still nicely suit them.

Everyone can go on and say marriage is this and that but bottom line, this is SG. SG is an expensive place to stay and no matter what, $$$ counts for something. If you force one or both to give up their flats if they get married, it is a very strong deterrence to get married. Ppl will just end up cohabiting. The only thing i can think of is, not to set penalties when getting married but maybe when singles apply for BTOs, their chances are halved of married couples. This issue will be hard to solve, so those ppl getting paid $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ better use more of their brains.

Not getting married does not mean ppl can't find love and share a flat, set up family, etc. It's a modern world. Majority will of course get married, but the number those choosing not to get married is climbing, to set a penalty on ppl getting married having to sell their flats will just deter them even further. 
 

Again, SG is an expensive place to stay, especially more so for the younger generation who did not benefit from any of earlier HDB policies, you can say $$$ isn't everything, but in reality we all know it is important. HDB flats even BTOs will easily wipe out most of the younger gen's CPF savings for a long time to come, and they know it. It's just being realistic

But if both men and women are in love, and swear to live together till death, why not get married? Have it legally bonded, and give the woman the title she deserves.

Ok let's see which solution is easier ...
 

a) Moving parents out of their long time home to say Punggol or Woodlands

b) Paying more and buying a flat near your parents

c) Make a round trip everyday in Singapore rushhour traffic to drop your kids off before going to work and picking them up after work
 

People in SG are already starved of their own personal time after work. So convenience is really the key.

When you have kids around, u prefer your parents or a nanny taking care?
 

Work around. Which is the easiest workaround (albeit most costly) ??  
 

No $ then of course do a) especially if u have no car. Forget abt dropping ur kids off anywhere before work.

But if both men and women are in love, and swear to live together till death, why not get married? Have it legally bonded, and give the woman the title she deserves.


Those are idealist thoughts and nothing wrong with it. If ppl choose the time is right to do so, then go ahead. 

If said couple had already sworn to live together till death, there really isn't a need to get married then. If getting married create a stronger bond than before, why so many divorce cases then? 
 

My argument is based on being realistic in today's society. The younger gen not so stupid, they know their CPF will be F---ed even if they buy a new BTO, to penalize them to sell their flats if both have one each will be detrimental and such a strong financial penalty will further push them away from the idea of getting married. Marriage isn't a bad thing, but to put in place financial penalties to couples who each have a flat is a bad idea. But it's PAP, so they might think it's genius. Of course i could be wrong. Maybe ppl are really in an idealist state of mind about such things and those who think like me are a minority. 
 




And what happens when a baby comes along? Consider born out of wedlock?




Doesn't mean baby won't be raised in a loving family. + Not everyone might want kids, singles who have already chosen to buy a BTO each at age 35 have probably made the decision not to have kids if they already did not do so.

many lower income singles are being priced out by the resale market. Imagine u earning 1-2k/mth. The resale 3 room prices are too high for them.

Actually i would suggest staggered income ceilings to accord to different income groups.
 

And the same flat is priced differently to different income groups.Those earning more pay more 

n vice versa.
 

Meaning, eg, 4 room new sell for 300k to 10k ceiling.
 

but sell for 400k to 15k ceiling n so on.
 

That is for new flats.
 

No of purchases of new flats remains.
 

This way subsidies are directed to right people n lesser have problem buying flats.
 
 

Above certain income level can only buy resale.
 

And resale prices are monitored to be sure to be affordable to these buyers.
 

Residential status paramount.

I read an article before, there is one single commented that even monthly salary is $3.5 to $4K also cannot afford resale 3 room.
