i fergot the costs, i think 800+ thereabouts. (For 1x 3 seat sofa, no measuring involved because we provided them the original upholstery, just copy only)
 

disappointments? delay after delay after delay after delay, then when finally get the covers, fitment all wrong, ask them to make with leeway and extra length, end product came back smaller then the samples we provided. had to send back 2-3 times to rectify. too much trouble, too much hassle, zero customer service. end up take over 3 months to get it done and still not done properly.

no, because our original sofa the covers are removable, so we just passed it to them to do a 1-1 copy with the only instruction being, make the covers larger because our old one shrunk due to improper washing. in the end came back smaller...

When he bought..the leather was not so good..quite thin..it starts to crack & peel in 2 years.
 

then spent almost the price of the brand new sofa set to re upholster..the leather & workmanship is good.

Can feel the quality....
 

again nobody bother to maintain..now i see cracks at the side of the sofa....

A few years ago we had a great sofa and armchairs which we really liked.

Lasted for about 15 years but in the end needed to reupholster.

The missus looked but couldn't find anywhere suitable at the right price so we junked them 
 

Recently my sil found a place and had her two sofas done.

Fantastic job, just like new but this time with a patterned fabric.
 

They look great and it was ok pricewise.

Really wish we had found the place.

Asked a few companies, most in the range of $700-900 for Syn leather. Worth it?
