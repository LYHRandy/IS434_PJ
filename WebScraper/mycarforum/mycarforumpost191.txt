First it was the Land Transport Authority. Now the Housing Board is installing closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras to deter illegal parking.
 

It plans to put them up near service roads and loading bays around HDB carparks in areas including Bedok, Toa Payoh and Sengkang.
 

Motorists parking illegally will face fines ranging from $25 to $200, depending on vehicle type.
 

An HDB spokesman told The Straits Times the cameras will be installed in 55 areas from the second quarter of this year.

I only 1/2 support ... 
 

cos... at certain places (my working place) there are no open parking around the HDB blocks and MSCP is about 400 meters away from the coffee shop. Usually park along the main road or HDB loading/unloading bays to buy 'teh-si' kosong. If installed, I have to forgo my favourite 'teh-si' kosong stall .... 
 

Recently, traffic warden also frequent the main road with camera snapping away happily ...

Hmmm... it will also be a good move to monitor all those "handicap" parking lots then. See if the car contains any genuinely handicapped people or not??
 

I think loading/unloading bay is also a good place to put cameras. Some people driving commercial vehicles also like to park there although no genuine loading/unloading activities being done.
 

It may also protect drivers (of normal vehicles, e.g. cars) who have genuine case of unloading/loading to do, in places which are only served by MSCP. I have been fined before by over-enthusiastic enforcement officers while unloading heavy items after a shopping trip - just because I was not driving a lorry, I think! But got the fines waived, luckily. If there was camera footage, would've been easier for them to check.

while it's good for the authorities to clamp down, have they gone too far ? What's next? Camera outside out home to see if your bicycle is parked illegally on the corridor ? 
 

Because of some kukus, the rest are made to pay. Sometimes, we really just wanna park, run up and pick son and run down. For those saying park in MCSP, good for you. Sme carparks don't allow non-season parking till the 5th storey, and it's 5 mins away from block.

Yeah?
 

If everyone thinks like you, park, run up run down what will happen to all the lots of people who paid for it? 
 

Would you like to come home to be deprived of resident lots to idiots who have no business parking in those lots, especially the loading and unloading, handicapped lots? 
 
 

I support the illegal parking camera. Well done HDB.

Just sharing - maybe it is coincidence - I saw a parking warden yesterday afternoon, and I saw another on today at the same car park!! 

Anyway, I am happy to see them. 
 

Parking wardens, if you are reading this, please visit Bt Batok Park - at least 90% don't put parking coupons.
