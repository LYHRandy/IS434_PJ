Dude,
 
Go to Jesprit @ Plaza Singapura. They did my curtains. Very professional and nice selection of materials and designs. Look for Ice and tell her I recommended you. You know my name and where I stay so just let her know. Should be able to get a good price.

My home use Rolashades http://www.rolashades.com/index.htm.
 
Suprisingly reasonable pricing for residential ones. They did National Library too.
 
If your budget allows, can even install remote control motorised ones.

like that.. then cannot help you liao..  

alternatively, you can consider IKEA, they got a wide range of curtains and blinds for you to choose from. However, if you are fussy over quality, then may be a no-go for you.

For reasonably priced curtains and blinds, you can try Toa Payoh central. there are quite a few shops situated at those 2 level shop houses.

If you are not sure about its rate, i suggest pop into at least 2 shops to enquire. Their pricing is competitive (especially when they knew you did your homework)
