The Real Estate Developers’ Association of Singapore (Redas) has urged the government to ensure that the property market remains healthy, media reports said. Speaking at the association’s 54th anniversary dinner last Friday, Redas President Chia Boon Kuah stated: “It is our hope that the government will calibrate its land sales programme to ensure land supply at a pace that will contribute to the overall health of the market.”He noted that “as long as homes are purchased with sound reasoning, we believe in riding out each cycle that comes our way”. “We have faith that the government will continue to monitor the movements in Singapore's property cycle, and ensure a balance between development viability and housing affordability.” He also revealed that while the industry has achieved success, it has had its share of challenges, which include dealing with the effects of the government’s seventh and most comprehensive round of cooling measures and the introduction of the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR). Furthermore, the expiry of the lock-in period of the Seller Stamp Duty from now till 2017 and the large supply of homes coming on-stream continue to weigh on the industry’s mind, said Chia.
 
 
 
I was just wondering what the general consensus among MCFers is? Are we hoping that property prices will come down significantly so that we can buy in (remember that your current property price will also decrease in value should you require to sell before you buy) or do we all hope the property prices will continue on this crazy bull run (remembering should you choose to upgrade the next property you buy will also be relatively higher)?

... provided buyers have no property to sell! Currently, most people are happy cos our property has risen in value cos our neighbour has sold at a XXX higher price but this is a false sense of security.

Some buy just because they wanted to feel 'upper class' but failed to calculate, does it really necessary and do they really have the means to support it.
 
If one have the means to upgrade, go ahead but please ensure that the family members must be taken care off first (child educations, medical) ....  
 
Real life story, I has a friend who sold his 4-rooms HDB to book a condo. Currently stays with parent temporary until the condo is ready in 2015 as money dumped on the condo. Suddenly son 'shot-gun' and need to settle down fast. He the KPKB also no use as money gone into the condo and no place to stay. Refused to help his son who was unemployed as just finish NS.
 
As a friend, advised his son to apply a rental flat from HDB first and appeal to the MP for help in getting a rental flat. Don't know the outcome as so long lost contact.

The key is a sustainable real estate market that's in line wif the country's economic conditions and market forces. An engineered crash in a boom economy shocks the system and triggers a wave of unintended consequences. Juz look at how messed up the COE system has become wif LTA's engineered interventions and screwed up populist policies.......  
 
Juz remember: "Be careful what you wish for".

the morale of the story is, they want you to get married earlier (when most of our earnings are not too high). After getting your brand new HDB flat and having babies, your earnigs leap frog to >20K also never mind. They won't chase you out from HDB de. Just continue to "squat" at your HDB flat, use excess $$$ for other things lor. But the problem is too many people try to take a large seat when their backside is too small.

By the time you had your finance stable, you cross the $12k mark and not entitle to HDB flats. You have to choose the DBSS or condo. Please be informed that private properties owners does not get medical grant in hospitals or polyclinics. They put you in A Class.... 
 
Since you planned to marry in 30, why don't you and your gf register a HDB 5 rooms flat now.

The industry of course wants to be healthy, ie more transactions and higher prices (because agents get commission from transacted price).
 
Generally upgraders and those on the sidelines with no property waiting to buy will want prices to drop.
 
Those downgraders and those vested in several properties for rental etc will want prices to increase

Singapore median income only like 3k? So, also not so easy for me to cross the 12k mark ba. I'm definitely not a high flyer.
 
And besides, I think at my current age (mid 20s), it's still early to commit for marriage. Then again, personal preference. I got a friend or two at my age got kids about 2-4 years old already.

Sounds similar to the second hand car dealers association crying for help.
But when they made big money, they didnt cry .....now faced with possible crumble, cry for help so fast.
 
Clap clap
 
The market WILL come down.
Not a question.
The question is by how much. 10%, 20% or 30%
 
Now property market is definitely not healthy.
To be healthy it needs to lose quite a lot of weight.

I am no finance whizz but you seem like you're in the field. I thought they will at least start the vacuuming $$$$$$$ by latest 2014 Q2. I don't think when they start vacuuming, they will let everyone know (though it maybe in their meeting minutes). They will quietly pull back the $$$$$$$. The markets react particularly badly even when Big Ben B farts!!!!  
 
I think 2015 is way tooo late and by then when "brown matter" hits the fan ... it will fly everywhere and does not bode well as we are due to exercise our inalienable right by end 2016.

 	MAS cautions on foreign property investment  

SINGAPORE: The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on Wednesday (May 21) warned citizens of the risks attached to buying properties overseas, after data showed a surge in Singaporeans' investment in real estate abroad.
MAS said local real estate agencies had handled overseas property deals worth S$2 billion last year - a 43 per cent rise since 2012.
"MAS would like to remind potential investors to be mindful of various risks associated with overseas property purchases," the central bank said, citing foreign exchange and interest rate risks as examples, along with less stringent rules governing foreign property developers.
"Risks are more difficult to assess or manage when investors are unfamiliar with conditions in overseas markets, such as the prospects for oversupply of properties, or of a deterioration in economic conditions," it added.
MAS said it was closely monitoring overseas purchases "with a view to ensuring financial stability as well as financial prudence among Singaporeans".
Advertisements for overseas properties - particularly in Britain, Australia and New Zealand - are a common sight in Singapore, one of the world's wealthiest countries, with an average per capita income of US$55,183 (S$69,000) in 2013.
But the city-state of 5.4 million people is also the most expensive place to buy a luxury home in Asia after Hong Kong, property firm Knight Frank said in a report in March.
Singapore last year imposed new measures to cool the red-hot local property market, including raising stamp duty - which made it costlier for foreigners to buy property - and sharply increasing minimum cash downpayments for buyers applying for loans for second homes.
These were in addition to earlier measures to tame the property market, including a move by the central bank in 2012 to impose a maximum tenure of 35 years for new housing loans.

"Risks are more difficult to assess or manage when investors are unfamiliar with conditions in overseas markets, such as the prospects for oversupply of properties, or of a deterioration in economic conditions," it added.
MAS said it was closely monitoring overseas purchases "with a view to ensuring financial stability as well as financial prudence among Singaporeans".
Advertisements for overseas properties - particularly in Britain, Australia and New Zealand - are a common sight in Singapore, one of the world's wealthiest countries, with an average per capita income of US$55,183 (S$69,000) in 2013.
But the city-state of 5.4 million people is also the most expensive place to buy a luxury home in Asia after Hong Kong, property firm Knight Frank said in a report in March.
Singapore last year imposed new measures to cool the red-hot local property market, including raising stamp duty - which made it costlier for foreigners to buy property - and sharply increasing minimum cash downpayments for buyers applying for loans for second homes.
These were in addition to earlier measures to tame the property market, including a move by the central bank in 2012 to impose a maximum tenure of 35 years for new housing loans.

oh, i am not concerned with the investors. They are taking high risk which i'm sure they are well aware of.
 
i'm just mocking at the hypocrisy of the MAS. Wanna monitor TDSR? only for their own backyard it seems
 
allowing Singaporeans to run wild into unknown territories? haha.. doesnt seem like they really care if singaporeans overextend themselves or not... 
 
or maybe i misjudged MAS.. their intentions are pure but they are just tooooo slowwww to react to what is happening on the ground

Lets give them the benefit of the doubt.
Maybe MAS do have the good intention to warn singaporeans not to invest blindly in overseas market. Afterall, we won't be able to react on time in event of policy changes in that country.
 
Nevertheless, thought the trend has been going on for quite some time liao. Even advert has shown ppl investing in lots of foreign properties with minimal cash outlay.
So in that sense, MAS should act promptly. Maybe they have a feel that the trend just creep up so dangerously after they intro the BSD, ABSD.
 
Hope commoners don't ganna burnt in property investment.

Someone please ask REDAS to STFU! They are the world's biggest speculator and have earned billions in the past 6yrs of property bull run, and by saying "healthy" they meant big fat profits. It can't continue this way and someone have to give them a reality check.

precisely bro
 
the surge in overseas properties have been ongoing for years. Last year was the worse in the sense volume was highest and price also highest
 
Now when everyone went in already, then they say they will start to monitor.. what gives?
 
In terms of buyer profiles, overseas investors are typically average to below average income household, with many retirees. In terms of risk, it is definitely higher simply by the fact that most investors are not well versed in the market as compared to SG.
 
So i have my doubts that MAS is concerned about the average folks..

wah so much anger
 
the best way you can help to give them a reality check is to not buy anything.
