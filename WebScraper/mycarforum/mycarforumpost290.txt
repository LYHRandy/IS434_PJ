Congrats on yer new house... nippon and ici i don think got much price different. the difference i think comes from which grade the paint is. nowadays they have the no-smelling ones and easy wash ones... no point go so far to find, just get at the nearest shop can already. even i tried going to nippon shop they say just because we official shop means cheaper mah???. personally i use the smaller rollers as it doesn't splatter too much, but it needs more rolling. The normal colours usually cost around $45-$55. The weatherbond cost more as its almost waterproof.
