I thought that is really bad. I mean if the residents of a condo votes to not install opennet, why not?
 

Why should IDA shove it down everyone's throat? If 90% of the residents have no need for it, why should they fork out the money to have fiber cable run into their development?
 

I think it is a screwed up by IDA. IDA think that if they provide FREE but EXPOSED cabling, the majority will take up the offer, thus they tendered and budgeted for such. Which is stupid.
 

Now 90% of the condos refused to do it as exposed trunking is butt ugly and hacking/concealment costs are high. 
 

So what does IDA do? They just shove it down the condos throat and ask the residents to pay for all the hacking costs.

IDA also has their own agenda to push eg xx% of homes in Singapore connected via high speed fibre at 20xx. Like that can be bragging rights to potential foreign investors which might require high speed access to their home based customers. Then also maybe next time all TV programs will go through high speed fibre and can therefore free up the broadcast frequency, allowing it to be reharvested for other uses. 
 

Actually it's good to be wired up because if you intend to sell the property later on, maybe can boost that high speed connection is available? Though won't increase selling price by 4 digit.  
 

Anyway, those trunking are not that big. Once painted over (unless sway sway yours is wallpapered), will blend in with the wall and after 2 months, you won't even notice it.
 

My estate won't be wired till late 2012, not that I require that high speed.

As far as i know from what i read, spore is one of the slowest internet speed in the world but also one of the most ex, hence they need to do something abt it. Fibre optic this kind of internet connection, other countries already in use for very long time, spore only now den start, hence bo bian, they need to force everyone to install so that they can catch up with the rest

I think IDA just want the building to have the infrastructure,  probably a main panel to be located inside the condo, individual owners can then choose to install or not install it onto their homes.

Can the superbroadband fiber just go to the clubhouse or guardhouse?

Then management just buy one super duper wireless router to service all the residents.

One account for all residents! cheap cheap!

I mean the super fast download speed can best be shared, if individual subscribed to the high speed broadband it will be wasteful. Unless you download bittorent or watch movie 24/7, else most will only use 0.1% of the broadband speed to surf and read facebook or farmville.

no, I think IDA wants it routed to EVERY FLOOR. cannot be just A MAIN panel lah. If a resident live in 20th floor wants the fiber, he is supposed to route from main panel up to 20th floor meh? 
 

So all these EXTENSIVE hacking and concealment woke is a lot of money leh. IDA just wants the residents to pay for it so they can hit their milestones and report back to minister.

How you know they are for it? 9 out of 10 condos rejected it. It all depends on the costs right? I think the costs must be very high and that is why 9 out of 10 rejected. If cost $10 who will reject?
 

IDA really screwed up. They should have bargained for concealed routing and they will get a better cost than individual condos as it is a nationwide project, economies of scale.
 

Instead they just throw back to the condo management and ask them to source for their own contractor and pay out of their own pockets. And they fine you $1000/day if you delay....
 

Anyway, I thought the bottleneck is the overseas connection, not our local infrastructure.

I've seen skirting boards which have trunking included in them for running cabling around properties.

So you could just change the skirting boards without having major hacking.
 

BTW we are part of SERS and will move from our old HDB to the new one next year.
 

The old HDB has had fibre optic cabling recently laid to the ground floor.This block is due for demolition when we all move out.
 

When my missus called Open net 12 months ago to check that they will install fibre optic before we move into the new HDB, Open net said they had no idea a new block was being built and the fibre optic cable would have to be fitted retrospectively.
 

Really fed up with Open net.

And what does this GLC intend to do once the roll-out is completed? 
 

Yes, sell the existing infrastructure to the consortium and form a business trust...
 

Anyone want to guess what this GLC would do with the excess cash? Return to shareholders? 
 

Now, who owns the majority stake in this GLC?

There is another reason why the IDA are forcing this onto unwilling parties. But that is a reason which cannot be disclosed. Just know that once opennet starts, there will be lesser illegal activities thru the net. And net cases may be solved faster.

IDA never say the owner MUST lay to their house even they dont want... even in HDBee... if owner dont want, dont lay lor, same what...... but at least if lay liao, the infrastructure is there..... if anyone change their mind.... just ask CON-tractor lay to house... finished..... KNN free one still make noise... take first lar.... talk later....  
 
 

KNN what pay for hiding the cable and simi LJ.... NBzz you think the $$$ come from who??? You wanna whole Singapore pay for all the "eat wind" house to lay cable in the house... Please lar...  
 

Even those staying HDBee also need to pay for laying cable into their house.... so what make the "eat wind" house so special....

also the content i am interested are all overseas, so even with fibre high speed, it is pointless just to access useless content in sinkietown.
 

the reason for this openet is they are trying to spur the IT economy by spending on this infrastructure so that content will evolve and grow in future.

frankly, can wait long long. there will NEVER be a google or facebook from sinkietown no matter how smart we are.

at most its another media to watch tv and video, the matrix only needs workers, not smart people.

what the point of rolling out this crap when they are going to throttle the speed if traffic gets too heavy....
 

furthermore, the best contents are overseas.... they should save the money and upgrade the undersea cables instead
 

1-2mbps line can be fast.... until they choose to throttle it or due to congestion between countries.... base on bandwidth the ISP subscribe to....

with more ppl on the NGNBN, the costs will be reduced.  just like mobile phones and later data plans, more ppl using it, more suppliers in the market, prices reduced.  Just compare ur data plans in the past and now.
 

yes, condo dwellers will have to suffer the 'inconvenience' of exposed trunking.  Why?  Too atas issit?  We HDB dwellers have exposed trunking as standard.  I dont see the harm in the elites having to bear a bit of costs and inconvenience for the good of us masses.

The want-this-want-that attitude we can rule out. But the very least, we should still be allowed th option to decline. 
 

How can they force an installation on anyone's home as homeowners will be the one who have to look at the exposed trunking everyday?

technically not possible to run...even they find the conceal pipe.. as mine was re-routed beneath the tiles..
