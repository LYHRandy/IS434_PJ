I don't think it will affect the prices of private properties by alot especially the upmarket ones.
 

The question is whether HDB prices will actually go down with this new policy

Unker Khaw shld juz stick to playing wif hdb policies to control price and do his social engineering since it's owned by ah gong. 
 

He shld stay away from kacau-ing pte properties as it's really none of his biz as pte ppty owners receive no handouts or subsidies from gahmen.

Pte and Resale flats will be untouched.
 

New flats may have schemes like:
 

1) Low flat price but can only sell back to HDB

2) Not so low flat price but longer occupation period before you can sell in resale market

If the HDB price still remain high before GE2016, then the next GE will could be a game changer.

price drop, sure got catch one lah

if the catch is too small, KBW makes buyers happy but incur the anger of the hdb owners (probably there are more owners than buyers)

if the catch is too big, KBW makes owners happy but incur the anger of the hdb buyers 

question is where will he draw the line  

not easy   he is keeping his cards close to his chest 

can anyone go stand behind him  and see whether he got a joker card or not

New flats drop 50% from existing butg can only resell back to HDB, or 30% but 10yrs MOP.

Resale flats subsidy 200k (5rm), 150k (4rm) from HDB but can only resell back to HDB in the future, or lower subsidy but MOP of 10yrs
 

if gov really wanna drive down the prices of public housing, they definitely need a measure as drastic as the MAS policy to curb car loans.

High prices people complain,
 

price falls people complain.
 

The only solution is to keep prices
 

high when I want to sell
 

and let the price fall when I want to buy.

actually the Govt is doing something very effective in driving down resale price - release EC land

i think the EC takeup rate by upgrader is about 60%

let say one condo has 300 units, 60% is 180 units

this means when TOP, 180 resale flats will be released to the market

the more EC, the more resale units released into the market

currently it is not impact the resale market so much yet as most of these EC has not TOP yet, so far i think only esprina

must wait for these EC to TOP, then resales price will drop

it is not effective at all because each release is at either an higher price of the previous or small unit selling at the same price (PSF increase.) furthermore those actually drive up the price high.
 

they should streamline the selling price of every level for BTO, EC if they are realling interested.
 

also, please bring back Executive Apartment. Whats the point of upgrading to a smaller EC from a five room when upgrading mean wanting bigger flat. (of course those wanting same size flat but condo is also valid)

Damn if they do and damn if they don't... 
 

If prices don't drop, the younger generation kenna saddled with heavy housing debt. 
 

If prices drop, whichever generation of retirees will see their nest egg go up in smoke and the govt gets a generation demanding for assistance.
 

Compromise lah, best if J22  Khaw has the guts to roll out a transparent pricing policy for first time HDB owners pegged to their last 5 years and next 5 years income and MOP 7 years. That way, every newbie gets 1 chance to hop on the SG dream. With 7 yr MOP, the retirees won't see much effect from cheap BTO on their flats.
 

But those who insist on staying in mature and/ or central HDB have to pony up the premium bec you don't need to wait for the town to developed. In new HDB towns, there is a waiting period.

Already i heard that contractors are shunning way from HDB because of the low margin. Drop by 30% will means further constraints on the building cost... 

Unless they start to fire or pay cut some of the top men in HDB. i dun see how singaporean is not paying for the high price. Its either in terms of tax or in terms of acquiring cost.

as long as there are upgraders who bought the EC, whether or not the EC price is high, these upgraders will still have to sell their hdb upon TOP

in fact the Govt has mandated that EC developers can only start selling only after the foundation is completed - this will encourage faster TOP, which means hdb resale units being released earlier to the resale market

the Govt also makes sure that the release of these resale units are spaced out, instead of being bunch together as 1 big speed hump

they do this by releasing 1 or 2 EC land every 3 months, by doing so, they hope to have a series of smaller speed humps along the way

we should be able to see the effects of these speed humps in about 2-4 years time when these EC TOP - 2016  

 for the Govt for that

but there is a very big risk for these EA, EM, jumbo units - let say enbloc, hdb gonna only give 110sqm 5 room as replacement only  

but i doubt will enbloc in the next 20 years lah  

unless you sell off your 4 room and hoot EC penthouse

somemore must hoot those already in the market type like twin fountain because the new EC all max 160 sqm

BTO mainly for first timer who has not bought any property... In reality most existing property owners can't get a BTO due to policy restrictions or income restrictions. So BTO market is not those that will buy private property, and private property owners can't do BTO.
 

Obviously those who are damn affected emotionally by this kind of news are existing Hdb flat owners who are concern that the cheaper BTO will affect the sale price of their current flats.

Construction cost is quite standard. Can't run away one.

Just like the construction cost for mass mkt OCR condos - middle class RCR condos-CCR high class condos-CCR Mt Everest class condos are pretty standard. You think developers (like FEO or CDL) who engage their main con don't know the construction cost?

Likewise HDB also knows the cost.

And if you run through those listed main con, their margins are not spectacular. Otherwise you won't see such firms go bust in every cycle. Ah Beng's sister Poh Lian went belly dancing recently.

You are barking up the wrong tree.

yeah lor.. that is why initially i was targetting at Jumbo flat, but gave up 
 

like you say, now I target EC penthouse or Condo dual key. (target doesnt mean will reach. but just work towards that lor) 
 

another option is if my neighbour sell house. i buy from them and my house sell to my parents at their house selling price. then try to rent the corridor from HDB (neighbour is last unit on the corridor sharing same corridor as mine unit.) then build a gate.

Cos' alot of them are waiting for their EC meh? think until now none of the EC has top yet.. So many are waiting to sell..

for existing EA, EM, jumbo, there is a risk of enbloc IF the block of flat is lower than the surroudning blocks

for example if your block is 4 storeys and your neighbouring all 13 stories, then your one dangerous liao

6.9M is no joke, they are gonna maximise every plot ratio available  
 

if you wanna hoot EC big one, really must act now. there are only a few EC now which are not subjected to the new ruling

if you wanna hoot EC big one, really must act now. there are only a few EC now which are not subjected to the new ruling



 
 

Raise Plot Ratio ... i support!! :) 

hee hee .. i hope they raise all 1.4 to 1.8.. then even if the price goes down.. still Haut for me ! :)

New EC owner has to sell their HDB lah.. 

In any case, dont you see it looming.. there may be a chance that you can no longer sublet your whole house. Already PR cannot sublet liao.. Maybe they will put a age barrier to subleting.. You need to be over 60 yrs old and finished the house mortgage .. then you can sublet you hdb.

now is 3 years  to 3.5 years max. for those who bought after khaw take over.
 

my friend who bought early last year are getting their flat early or mid 2014. those bought in dec 2011 are getting it august ~ november. those bought 2009 are waiting for their flat 2015 



 

its roughly around 3 yrs for the ones that are in mid-late construction phase. For those who just booked, u go check the times, it's roughly around 3.5-4.5 yrs now. The recent BTO for Bt batok. estimated 40+ to 50mths.

sooner or later, Govt will ban people from renting out their HDB if they have a pte property

the first few speed humps will still be able to get a good price

hahaha KBW kena left right by everyone, when 1 of the main drivers of the boom since 2009, the ridiculously low SIBOR is the one thing which many home buyers have been "carry trading" on, as well as the deposit % required for mortgage. IMO M@S also has to shoulder d blame n no entirely on KBW. Somehow they fail to understand that cheap loans n high gearing = high inflation.
 

How M@S allowed SG SIBOR to follow US$ LIBOR rates, despite our housing & economic fundamentals being so much stronger, i still dun understand. Its basically allowing something strong to get even stronger, n now its unhealthy...

yeah lor.. that is why initially i was targetting at Jumbo flat, but gave up 
 

like you say, now I target EC penthouse or Condo dual key. (target doesnt mean will reach. but just work towards that lor) 
 

another option is if my neighbour sell house. i buy from them and my house sell to my parents at their house selling price. then try to rent the corridor from HDB (neighbour is last unit on the corridor sharing same corridor as mine unit.) then build a gate. 



 

actually if u are staying with your family. then why bother. Just knock down the living room partition and install  a sliding door. 

Then u better kawan kawan with your neighbour 1st

actually dont think many blame Khaw as 2009 he wasnt the minister in charge. so far he is doing a fairly good job in my opinion. afterall property price is a sensitive subject. you cannot let it drop too drastically too soon unless its economic crisis.

wah piang eh, you ok or not  

when your EC TOP, you have to sell your HDB within 6 months  

i neber ask you to sell your EC lah  
 

you see ah: whenever a EC TOP, about 200 hdb resale units is released into the resale market

the very first EC to TOP enjoys this price advantage

after that when more EC TOP, more and more hdb resale units are released into the resale market

if the market cannot absorb anymore, then you are stuck with a unfavourable price for your resale 4 rm

probably by then, Govt will stop the EC again
 

thats why i tell you to do it now do it fast

neber be the last in the musical chair game

KNS. you tell me go buy EC leh. i where got EC to buy??
 

if you are talking about i go buy now.
 

HDB ruling say can only apply after 5 years. i check before when my previous flat was 4-1/2 yr.. unless they change the ruling of course.
 

basically for the next 2-1/2 years.. i dont need to see resale,BTO,EC or PTE.

they will do it, because we r becoming uncompetitive compared to our neighbours. Rental cost is a big problem for biz here, ask any biz man, so if garmen doesnt force down this n make SG competitive again, the MNCs moving out n job losses later on will be even worse.
 

Plus our GDP growth is extremely unhealthy, coz if not for property n construction, we will have been in recession for the last 6mths!!! 
 

THis shows we cannot survive as an economy coz certain sectors like property has over grown n destroyed the value chains of all the other sectors here. Theres a big rebalancing required. U dont see any news reports abt this coz they dont wanna scare the pple

a lot of advantage. but mostly because they spend lots of time and effort to bring me up. i want to let them have good life. i also thinking if can make it rich and afford a Landed. i will want to bring my parents in law to live together too. then the 4 old ppl can play mahjong.  (okay wishful thinking of getting both side parents to live in peace)
 

Any case, i think letting them rent out their house for their own income is one of the best thing for them too.

i am assuming your storage bed and sofa mean 

1) Those sofa bed?

2) those bed that can be stored into the wall?
 

both got disadvantage. 
 

1) sofa bed material is really very bad. not good for sleeping especially for older ppl above age of 30. lets face most of us dont exercise after army. our back are stiff sleeping on those are going to be bad for our back.
 

2) i saw two problem. Moving mechanism mean that the mechanism might spoilt and also troublesome so like after a few round you leave it as it is and dont keep unless you expecting visitor. dangerous if you have young kids too. 
 

also since its build in, this mean that your bed thickness had to be of certain height. meaning that the type of bed you getting likely wont be those high end bed. so less comfy. 
 

Some might say waste money to spend money on bed. $200 from parsa malam will do. but i beg to defer on this as we are spending the most important part of our time and also the most amount of our time on the bed. so its better to invest in a good one. Having said that.. different people different stroke.

I agree with Galantspeedz that the intention of living together is good. But hor, from my observation from surrounding friends who are doing that, end up the old folks got more things to do leh. It only benefit the young couples so that they can relieve their chores and have more excuses to come home late since they know kids are safe at home with old folks. End up old folks no freedom, worse if they got to sleep with grandchildren at night. So i think sometimes they need freedom more than anything. For my case, i try not to go over to my parents' place on weekends bcos i think they deserve a good rest, let them go majong or meetup with friends/relatives also good.

Yup, i go over to their place every evening for dinner and pick my kids. So i see them from Mon-Fri. Sat and Sun are off days for my mother, she is free to do whatever she wants ie. majong or kopi with friends. 
 

Baby got baby chores, toddler got toddler chores, schooling kid got their chores also. Every stage is different till they are old enough to be independent, which is like 12 or 13 yrs old onward then can be xin lang.

okay your case is different, your parents are looking after the kids.
 

mine are not. my children are at childcare from monday to friday. so they miss their grandchildren.
 

frankly, due to market condition and government ruling on MOP. by the time i can get a next home will be when my kids are 12 or 13 years old. thats why i say by then my children dont need ppl to look after.

oh and i give you a better idea...  get a 6k sqft to 10k sqft land,  reconstruct 3 houses with different entrances so you can have your wish of staying together but not really together...

I don't think it will affect the prices of private properties by alot especially the upmarket ones.
 

The question is whether HDB prices will actually go down with this new policy 



 

if they are serious abt bringing the mkt back to funamental and bring down BTO prices to 150K to 300K max (4 room flats depending on location), then it will definitely bring down those crazy suburban condos that are asking for more than a 1,000 psf.
 

However, like u said, it is prob a way to talk down the mkt. BTO prices prob lower by 30K or so. They wun dare to do anything drastic now cos too much uncertainties gog on and they have built way too many new flats over last 2 yrs.

Unker Khaw shld juz stick to playing wif hdb policies to control price and do his social engineering since it's owned by ah gong. 
 

He shld stay away from kacau-ing pte properties as it's really none of his biz as pte ppty owners receive no handouts or subsidies from gahmen.



 

can't help it..
 

it's all connected. That's why the suburban prices ranaway like the wind, thanks to hdb upgraders. High end ppty still hardly moved. 
 

and virtually all new developments are built on GLS sites. all packaged and sold by khaw's men.

Personally, I'm okay with longer MOP with a discount in price.
 

For home owners who're not planning on going anywhere anyway - and keeping with the philosophy that the flat is a "home" - then longer MOP is no issue.
 

Overseas, there is concept of "home" where generations grow up, grow old at the same address. This is really a "home" where people spent 20, 30 years easily keeping the same house.

I don't see why a social housing should even talk about steep appreciation, just over a span of 7 years. As mentioned previous threads. I bought a 5 room flats in year 2000 at about $290k. Now worth around $600+k. Just crazy. Have never heard of property price appreciate in such a short period, before. 

As for 4 roomers, I do agree the price should bring down further to about $150K - $250k depending on location. This is only apply for the first timers who are married and priority to those already have young children. This are the group that have the potential replace Singapore ageing population.

i never suan you.. a normal terrace is a reachable target for evryone...
 

i was just letting you know, most normal terrace is 3-4 rooms max... if you count your parents or in laws, you and your partner, your 2 children (1 in planning you say).....you may not have a space for maid.... 
 

then you say you want to buy 4-5 rooms one... which usually is a semi-d unless is 3 storey... then your dream becomes harder to reach.. so i think.. might as well dream even bigger lor....
 

or maybe the next thing you gonna say is partition alot of rooms..... 
 

you get what i am trying to say....?

okay sorry, i thought you suanning me.. you are actually giving me advice. 
 

yeah. i get what you mean.. anyway, parents in law coming in to live with me is just a emergency plan as i forsee my other sister in law might not be able to look after them from the way they plan their finances. 
 

but likely wont happen and i hope it wont due to character different between my parents and in law. althought they are happy when going out together.. but then again living together is a totally different issue altogether.
 

will keep what you mention in mind.

High prices people complain,
 

price falls people complain.
 

The only solution is to keep prices
 

high when I want to sell
 

and let the price fall when I want to buy.
 






then is lppl; everybody buy n sell diff time.
 

price at least stagnate, if not dip lil, for next decade.
 

gotta avoid spikes to prevent recession / bubble burst.

There'll problems all way till d next big recession. When that happens, don't expect the same strong price for Hdb resale coz of the huge supply coming. In 2008 resale was solid due to under supply, now garmen intent on over supplying ahead of demand, so beware.

That's why you see many rented out their flats, while living in private ones. Ended up , our social housing become a FTs world. That's tax payer money too.

Agree that. Demand and supply for properties have never been equal. This is due to nature of the sector, which takes 5 to 10 years in terms of the lagging effect. It seems no longer a real demand to me. We are seeing many are not stay in HDB, but rented out. So many are having more than 2 properties including the HDB. Yield have been great for HDB. So it make sense to rent out, rather than renting out the private. 

And now, we have another factor. The Iskander factor. We have many leaving in JB and rented out their HDB. Which is the reverse of what I'm doing now. We did not hear that years back, during the last property cycle.  So if the rental demand goes down, many in this group may suffer and end up force selling, either the private or the HDB. So with the slower growth in Singapore, this have made me to invest properties outward. So I believe the downward pressure, may starts from the rental market. It will come a day, where the market will hit hard. I a believer of not timing the market.  

As for Iskander, I am started getting worry, with so many property development multiping like ants. There, many also buy and rent out. But renting to how is a huge question mark. During 7 - 8 years ago, we don't see people renting. Because the population just does not support it. But luckily, I managed to rent it out to EU family and have been with me till today. Partly due to I charge them cheap rent, as compare today market rate. Bought cheap, so no problem.

One possible mechanism that Minister Khaw spoke about was to price BTO flats based on a multiple of median income. Specifically, he referred to pricing new flats in non-mature estates at four times the annual median income of applicants, which would imply a 30 percent fall from current pricing.
 

Wah, I like those words

you have mistaken the true intent of the car CM1..its to stop marginal consumers from committing financial suicide because of an impending storm..7 CMs for housing is not to reduce the prices..rather its to moderate the increase(due to hot $$ from USA) and also to stop marginal buyers from over-committing

CM1 for Car is not to stop marginal buyers. It is to bring the price down and hence inflation (face-value). M-buyers, 2nd hand dealers are collateral damages. MAS is not after them. 
 

Last few CM for house are to 'kill' demand but not to bring price down. And this is where Former scored and the Latter missed. Because demand is still strong and price has not moderated. HDB resale index still rising. CM8 likely to attack the price.

Yes.. Yes..Yes.. They complain everything about the germen, whether is good or bad policies. But doing this quietly behind the scene. I can see many Singaporeans are self-serving.  I have no bias towards any. Not because I'm a Singaporean , I will support own people even if their wrong and self-serving. 
 

After many rounds of grassroots meet up, I realized most of the suggestions are self-serving based on their profiles. There are a few real great suggestions, are benefiting long term.  
 

Recently , the changes of car loan idea was taken up and have implemented pretty fast.
