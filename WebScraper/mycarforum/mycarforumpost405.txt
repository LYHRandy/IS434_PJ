I saw some condos with balcony but there is no sink holes for water to drain out. 
How would the owner keep the area dry when it rains? 
 
Can buyer get a renovator to install one if there are none?

I am surprised that there is balcony without floor trap or discharge pipe. Most unthinkable. Even HDB balconies will have, how can condos one not have? It is a design flaw if really true.
 
Don't see how is it possible to do one if there really isn't any. Drain to where?

You mean drain hole?
 
AFAIK you cant create your own. It attaches to a pipe system below.
 
Unless your neighbor downstairs ok for u to mod his balcony ceiling and also provide drainage path

Yeah that's what I refer to. 
Then is it required that I must keep it from leaking water downstairs, just like indoor areas?

Balcony usually will be a drain outlet to open drain whilst kitchen or toilet then to a floor trap then sewer line. Nowaday, very relax and biz friendly, drain covers all sort of pattern. No regards to maintenance and ensjring water drain off fast enough. Standard of plumbing is really very low in singapore.

cost cutting...
 
Some contractors will not install cut off valves to your kitchen sink tap. Be careful... If leak, need to shut off main, which means whole house no water. I give the contractor an earful when he said no need. In the end, I forced him to install.

i see. 
could it be some concealed outlets? or i cant see in the virtual tour in that unit? 
 
my concern is what will happen if owner goes abroad or tenant too busy to handle that.

Most likely it’s hidden by the giant circle in the centre side of the balcony, slope to middle.

Property agents really sibei got alot of patterns these days. So who calling YT Tan to make an appointment to view the unit to check if there is any floor trap at the balcony? 
 
Maybe really close a case after viewing.   [laugh]

There's even a tap there. If there is no drain pipe, then i will be truly shocked...
 
oh, unless the owner actually laid tiles over the original balcony floor, and covered up the floor trap of the drain pipe in the process.
 
In which case, it was illegal, and will get the owner into trouble.

It’s not possible for a balcony to not have a drainage hole but in the unlikely event that there really isn’t any, it would deemed a design flaw and as an owner; you have a right to demand rectification.
 
However, I’m quite confident that there is a drainage hole for sure.

ok you are bound to be surprised. 
maybe it does have.
Likely to be some drain covers that have gaps to allow water to seep through. Or around the edges. Nice but not very practical design. Water cannot simply evaporated right. Haha

Could be the owner created ‘balcony’, thus no way to have a proper discharge.

Of course if owner created own balcony then nothing to say. 
Abit strange to hear this though cos most people I know want to enclose the balcony to get the extra bit of space in these days of smaller units. 
 
Those creating their own balcony perhaps would be those older apartments where space is much more I guess.

It's probably hidden in some corner. How can a balcony not come with a drainage system? Some are even more tactical that is hidden under a strip of tile that looks like part of the balcony floor. Don't be so suaku lah.

Seriously, I have not come across any balcony without a floor trap, HDB or private.  So could it be  a standard requirement?
 
Almost all floor traps are placed at the inner corner of the balcony so that the outlet pipes run against the wall. For private developments, these pipes are conceal. 
 
But you guys also damn CB lar, simi salah design, the TS asking for sink holes, no sink in the balcony where to find sink holes?  
 
And if ready balcony yim shui hor, use the following.

I really dislike maintaining balconies.

hmm... this sounds like a major project leh. From the pic/videos, look like the whole development all got balcony one leh.
 
If wanna ownself create, means hack away the ceiling/wall? i think no pass leh...

Yah, i think it should be a requirement for balcony to have drainage lah. Otherwise, it's asking for trouble, as collected water inevitably will try to find ways to escape, which will be downward - and then in time to come, sure will cause leakage to the downstairs neighbour's ceiling.

it should be a design flaw and should be reported to the authorities or at least question the developer.
 
In Singapore it rains and now with once in 50 years flooding event, it will not be fun living in that building.
 
 
I believe TS is mistaken.
 
 
No such cockup developer in Singpore. 
 
But then again, when TS collected keys for his or her apartment did the keys came with a bucket / pail.

Dont know le. But there is a hole in between the two toilet, and water would flow to the other side of the floor trap. There is no two separated floor trap in each side. Funny design also.
