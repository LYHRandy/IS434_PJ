Errr... That's like asking how much the legal fee is without asking an actual lawyer?

Transfer within 4yrs will tio seller stamp duty. That is separate cost from hiring lawyer to do the transfer legal paperwork.

If you have mortgage with the bank check with them first.
 
Stamp duty will be based on the property market value. Get a valuation for it, lastly get a lawyer to effect the transfer.

A rough estimate will be 3% of the property's value consisting of stamp duties and legal fees. As another forumer has pointed out , if the property falls within the sellers stamp duty timeframe , there will be a separate charge.

they won't charge you for such enquiry... so just ask for a better picture that will help to clear your doubts.
 
anyway you won't get to talk to them directly at first too. don't think of them like one that you need to pay just to listen to their voice.

Legal fees are the least of your worry, only a few grand.Stamp duties will put you back at least one solid gold Rolex easily.
Whats the estimated value of the property?

Sorry, how to gauge the value ? So far neighbors have not transacted any.

Using URA website, u could check the caveats for your neighbours who sold it recently. Else, use Property Guru for an agar-ation.
 
I reckon this is a new property if no neighbours have transacted? You can also ask for a bank loan and they can give u a valuation.
 
Seriously, technically, it is cumbersome to do it on your own. That's why we pay the lawyers.

Stamp duties on property transfers account for billions of dollars in tax revs
If i recall correctly, it forms the highest tax rev category.

You can get a desktop evaluation done by the bank's evaluation contacts, might cost a little.
 
I subscribe to a paid real estate data svc, you can pm your apartment details and I can look it up. I can't grantee it will get anything but its worth a try?

i been through this route before but did not stick to it due to stamp duty at 10%...
 
1. Contact lawyer to do up the transfer (amount ard S$2.5K)
2. Process of transfer should be treated like a normal sale since stamp duties are to be applied
3. if receiver already owned an existing property under his name, the stamp duty should be at 10% of the transacted amount (more if this is his 3rd property under his name)
4. outstanding loan should be fully paid to bank before transfer occur
5. Are u 55 and above? if yes, please check with CPF if they will hold back $155K locked in 
 
Please correct me if my understanding is wrong :)
