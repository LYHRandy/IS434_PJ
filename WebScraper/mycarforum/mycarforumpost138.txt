done it before......
 
mainly because I know I can get a better price than those agents who are more keen to close deals fast even if it means a thousand dollar less in commission they collect.

agreed.
 
very unprofessional of some agents.
 
my brother did sell by himself before.
 
quite cumbersome if you not already know the way.

I have 3 properties sold by agents before and 1 by myself.
 
my only conclusion is they want to seal the deal fast and it means they are ready to come back to convince seller to accept low price or even leak out the seller's baseline price to the buyer so that buyer know not to offer to high but is also convinced to throw in a bid price quickly.
 
some may say, trust the agents to get a better price for me as they know the market better.  I don't doubt they know the market slightly better but since their motivation is contradicting my interests, I dare say most of the times they used the better knowledge they have for their advantage rather than my advantage.
 
an exception is only when the agents serving us are our personal friends or relatives and they have a lot of shared agents' information of the latest transacted prices in that condo development.  for example, when I bought my current condominium, my agent disclosed to me some deals closed at high prices and that prompted me to quickly offer before these latest higher $ deals get reflected on the caveated prices.  indeed after I purchased mine, the higher prices gets reflected on the ura portal and I avoid having to compete the purchase on the back of higher transacted prices.

By the way, how you "promote" or advertise if by yourself.
 
Cos' if go thr agent, at least they place ads on propertyguru and etc..
 
You do the documents yourself also?

if you sell it yourself, your first medium would be the Straits Times Classifieds.  They do accept advertisement from retail customers if i not wrong,the cost should be about $40+ per advertisement.  even thru this medium solely, you can get quite a lot of viewers and enquirers already.  but take note many agents will then call you to try to persuade you to let them market your property exclusively.
 
if you happen to have an agent friend, you can ask him help to advertise on propertyguru, you pay him some money to offset his propertyguru subscription so as to sweeten the deal.

HDB ah? Simi first appt, second appt, muz get COE based on income, now dunno wat no COV but got valuation, if seller change mind cry farder marder go MP......sibei complicated sia.

what document? bro ... there's almost nothing for you to do. (maybe just check through the option if your lawyer prepares, but who doesnt read through this stuff anyway ..?)
 
let me list out the steps for you ... from start to finish, to show you how easy it is.
 
1. advertise in newspaper
2. entertain caller and do viewing
3. find a suitable lawyer beforehand
4. once you and the buyer reach a deal, ask them to issue a 1% cheque while your lawyer prepares a 2 week option (can vary based on terms agreed by both parties) for them. both of you exchange the items.
5. wait 2 weeks for the buyer to exercise the option. his lawyer will send his 4% option fee to your lawyer under CVY account. your lawyer will inform you when its exercised.
6. their lawyer will lodge caveat
7. you will provide your lawyer with tenancy agreement copy, mcst fees and property tax payment proof (up to the month of completion where necessary)
8. send the documents to your lawyer. (this is the only part you need to worry about .. delivering the documents. if you have the title deed with you, also better to send it by hand)
8a. where bank loan is concerned, just inform your lawyer to write in to the bank regarding redemption of loan.
9. wait for the deal to complete, collect your money.
 
nowhere in that grand scheme of things do the property agents do any kind of paperwork for you (unless they are using their standard company option .. which anyone can do .. fill out name, address, amount sold etc ... very simple stuff)

Yes totally.
 
Private definitely easier.
 
Done it twice myself.
Not difficult, just dont be sentimental and treat it like a pure business decision.
If people criticise the property, let it be. 
Offer a different perspective but no need to take it personally.
 
The problem with a lot of owners is that they take it personally and pride prevents the deal.
Stupid.  In that case just use an agent.

One of the main reasons why i went to take a CEA licence is because i can save on the ridiculous agent comm if i buy and sell my own properties. Plus i can help relatives and friends save on comm too if i do their tenancies for them
 
the savings far outweigh whatever fees i pay for the licence

some agencies do not have such rules i guess
 
i believe u can set up your own, just need to meet CEA requirements (like closing minimum number of deals, years of experience etc)
 
i also can;t stand moyes face.. LOL

Hi Moyes, What is the 'market practice' for renting. Say for 1 year, does the landlord pays the Agent or the tenant pay the commission? Agent no appointed by landlord.

wah lau dont call me moyes lah. feels like an insult
 
anyway now agents cannot collect from both sides. if the tenancy is new, usually landlord will pay. 1 year lease usually 0.5 mth commission.
 
So far i represented my parents and in-law when signing new lease so they dont need to pay. Then renewal i will also do for free, so the tenant also get to save, all parties happy

if u represent parents-in-law, there's actually a form you need to submit for non-conflict.
 
of course, most people wont ask for it since they wont expect agent and the person they are representing to be related...

I find it absurd that a property site do not allow direct owners to advertise, have to go through agents. Are they owned by the agencies? Why can't be like sgcarmart, allow direct owners to advertise, but at higher price. Now if I'm direct owner can only go through ST Classifieds.
 
Actually I find that property agents more leech than car dealers. Offer nothing much and get 1-2% commission. 1 transaction pocket thousands of dollars. Little risk to them. And many of them want exclusive arrangement. At least car dealers buy your car then resell, so they undertake the risk and so I feel entitled to mark up and earn from it.
 
I have used many form of middeman/agencies before, like car dealers, property agents, maid agencies, travel agencies, insurance agent. Other than maid agency I think no choice got to go to them, the rest can actually bypass and get a better deal yourself. Do you think the day will come when there are no more used car dealers, property agents and these middleman agencies?

yes, agents do not bring value to individuals, But they bring value to developers.
 
To sell out, developers would need hundreds of agents sending out flyers, intercepting unsuspecting pedestrians, advertising, FB, linkedin etc etc plus put together a convincing sales pitch. It is not practical for the developer to employ so many full time staff. Working with agents on commission basis makes more sense.
 
BTW, nowadays 1 transaction smelly smelly also 5 figure =).. thanks to lower sales volume, developers are willing to pay more to get rid of the unit.

Yah agree, for agents to market new properties I don't really care since it's the developers that pay them. In a way it's similar to the car market? New cars no choice have to go to distributors/dealer, but used cars can sell/buy your own to get better deal. Unless you lazy, then go to these middleman

what I cannot stand about their antics is that since they don't own the house they selling, they should not be overly anxious to close a deal fast to the extent of leaking out the seller's reserve price or persuading the seller to accept a low offered price

Not so for the local mass market context (my opinion) from the way buyers queue up and flock to showrooms LOL!
 
Agents represent high value to developers and owners when the properties to be sold are expensive and/or fall in a niche bracket. Agents are valued for their contacts, the bridge they form between buyers and sellers and the ideas they can generate to move the properties.

The little extra they can squeeze from the buyer or seller means nothing in terms of the commission they can get. Hence no point working so hard when the return is essential very close

I know, that's my grouses all these while.  I have seen agencies in fact, train their agents how to close deals faster and persuading the seller to accept lower price is one of the things they are trained for.
 
that's the problem with the current system, mismatch of priorities of agencies boss and customers.
 
agencies want to have more top sellers and it means volume is more important than $ closed.  so they teach their agents to work this way.  but who pays the agents?  it is in fact ultimately the customers and not the agencies

No choice lah. That's the economics of the business.
 
The agencies would rather close at $100,000 lower (as an example) and lose the extra comm of $1000-$2000 (1-2%) than risk losing the entire deal.
 
Any idea how to circumvent this besides dangling a carrot for achieving a higher price for the seller and vice versa?

a staggered commission rate may help somewhat but it probably isn't a game changer.
 
that's why if I could, I would never engage any agents, especially those agents that are mere associate than personal friend.  at least with personal friends, they know my motivation and not easy to hoodwink/push round with and they cut away those antics that jeopardise trust and friendship. 
 
a lot of such grouses stems from the fact agents think they can hoodwink the seller or they don't really work for the long term good of the relationship.

u're right about niche property
 
However, for mass market, i have learnt that it takes some hyping by agents to get the crowd to the showrooms. certain agencies have developed a reputation for doing it well and it could be observed the difference between mass market projs by such agencies versus the others
 
Quite interesting, really

no way to circumvent, buyer and seller both have to do their own homework to make sure that the agent is not BS-ing them
