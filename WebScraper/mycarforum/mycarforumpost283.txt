What would you do if you happen to have spare cash amounting to SGD400k/- SGD500k/- lying around?
 

Banks are offering good fixed deposit rates for foreign currencies,is it any good?
 

Should you invest in a few properties in Msia and rent it out?
 

Buy a small size condo near town and rent it out?
 

Seriously,im thinking of low risk investments here

Invest in yourself. No one gives you better returns than your own business. High risk? Depends on wat you do. High return? at least you are in control.

yes,was toying with the idea.in spore i can only buy one (studio or 1 bedder type near town) but in kl i can buy 2 or 3 city area condos.
 

have research,that a 2 bedder in kl city area can fetch RM4-6k at least,depending on location,but then again,min price for a property is RM500k.

Word of caution:
 

Buying house and renting it out isn't as 'safe' as it sounds.
 

Even if having freehold unit, a property depreciates year by year. Wear and tear mostly, for 99 years, even worse.
 

For 99 years unit, try not to hold longer than 20 years. Last time got an article for depreciation of 99 year units. First 10 years high, because like new car: the moment it's not 'virgin', price takes a hit. Depreciation slows down for the next 15 years, then up again. Ridiculously high for last 30 years.
 

But then again, chances of enblocing go up. So.....your own choice.

If you are a malaysian, i say go ahead with buying in KL.

If you are a singaporean that frequent malaysia and know the rules there go ahead.

if you are a singaporean that do not step foot of malaysia often, i suggest, just keep the money in singapore.

I am not too sure about if properties in Sinagpore is worth investing. If the ROI is so fantastic, why would the banks lend us the money to buy?

Because the banks diversify their risks.
 

This is lower risk than directly investing properties. And don't need to have people to manage them, like renting out, repairing, pay management fee, etc etc.

Bring them on tours (a whole convoy of 10 people or so), all free and easy, and charter our own transport or rent a few cars.
 

The returns?

You'll get more intangible love if you give them some thing more concrete and longer lasting.

Property is the way to go, especially in Singapore. 
 

Don't be overly worried about the spike and dips. If your horizon is 10 to 15 years, you will get good returns (capital appreciation or passive rental income).
 

Key is to look for the right property at a price that would not burden you. Remember, location, location, location. Freehold and leasehold not much difference these days.

foreign currency FD is a good idea and interest rate is definitely higher than SG banks' FD.

but you have to keep it for years for reasonable returns.

for short term, the exchange rate will be a disadvantage for you.

that's provided if you are planned not using the $$$.

i put some peanuts into foreign currency FD and knowing that i won't be using it.

got what i mean? extra $$$ only applicable on such.
 

blue chips are also another low risk investment.

good to have know-info and buy.

but you should know that low risk = "not very high" returns.
 

buying property is definitely a good idea.

however, you need to set aside your floating funds to top up installment since S$400k-S$500k can't purchase the whole house.

do note that you also need to pay for property tax and private condo/apartment's property tax is usually higher.

best is to get terrace house or semi-D.
 

hope it helps~

hmmm,buying a terrace or even any other landed is way out of my league lah.i would not want to over stretch myself.remember,this is spare money to be used as investment (get more money for me)not to kill me entirely.haha.a studio near town would fit the bill nicely,tink it will cost at least SGD600k/-.rent out while waitin for it to appreciate then sell lor.min rental near town is at SGD2.5 - 3k the last i saw for studio depnding on location knowing spore.....haiz!
 

I do not mind low returns just as long its a guaranteed fixed sum no matter wat.
 

do you know wats the best FD foreign currency interest like at the moment?saw AUD @ 5-7% cant remember wic bank.followed by NZD at 4-5%

ya true, for leasehold just make sure that i dont hold on to it for too long.
 

in land scare spore,most properties are leasehold,people lan lan will buy coz its the majority.of course freehold is the best but comes at a price.
 

even if i earn min SGD100k after selling this invesment property that i might buy,i am happy coz its still money earned at the end of the day.
 

one cannot get overtly greedy.

IMHO, beside buying property as investment, the other safest option is put into FD at 1.2%-1.8% for 2-3yrs. No need to monitor anything and just let the $$$ rolls......collect interest + principal amt at mature date. Buying shares will be too risky unless you study the market well.

UK is holding the Olympics in 2012.  Employment rate and economy in UK should improve due to the increased economic activities leading to 2012.  Tourism should improve around that period too.  Generally, GBP also has better ratings than euros.  Physical demand for this currency should be there.  I am buying a little bit.
 

Averaging down, carefully.  

I hope I am not catching a falling knife.

Not in my case.
 

Have already brought my family (about 10 ppl each time) to BKK, Hong Kong, Japan. We chartered mini bus to bring us around, but rented two MPV's in Japan instead (chartering a bus in Japan is super troublesome and bloody expensive). 
 

Of course I dont pay for everything; I pay for the air tix and maybe transport and some meals. Somebody else pays for something else, etc etc. Then I will draw up the itinerary and we discuss.
 

Up till now we are still talking about how much fun we had and where we are going next. That frees my mind from work for the entire week, recharges me over the weekend (we meet every sunday to wash and wax cars, and dinner), and readies me for another week of hectic work. In that way I perform better at work and in a way, it's a form of investment and returns. 
 

Invest in your family; it is always worth it.
 

Never had to borrow money from any of my family members - even paid for my own wedding, house, car, all out of my own pocket (and my wife's lah, of course).
 

Borrow money to buy $3 chicken rice because ran out of cash counted or not ah?

My take, buy some S$ perpetuals of the major local banks. 

S$500,000 is just short of 2 lots. S$250,000 nominal per lot.

Of course, if DBS, UOB or OCBC goes bankrupt, your money disappears too. 
 

Alternatively buy property.

of course must have holding power. no holding power equals to invest with nothing. no diff from gambling.
 

if still can service loan with no problems, that pce of property is technically still under yr name.

For very low risk, you can try our own Sgp Gov bonds. Pays slightly higher rates than fixed deposit. Buying from Fundsupermart allows you to take bite sizes rather than the $250 to $500K blocks from the banks. (But taking those blocks gives slightly higher rates)
 

http://www.fundsupermart.com/main/sgs/SGShome.tpl
 

Or you can go for NCPS from our local banks. Yields are better at about 3 to 6% depending on which you buy. For eg, the OCBC NCPS 4.2% is at $1.00 now. It gives you 4.2% of coupon per year (bi-yearly at 2.1%). These are slightly higher risk as the ncps prices do fluctuate with the market, but with much lesser volatility.
 

Then of course, there's the blue chips or higher dividend counters, some that pay about 5 to 7% based on current market prices. They have  higher volatility vs ncps... but also give room for upside/downside, depending on how well the company does going forth. (eg. SP Ausnet, UOB-KH, REITS, etc)
 

Diversify to spread your risks........
