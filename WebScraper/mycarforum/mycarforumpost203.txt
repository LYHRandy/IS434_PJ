i believe many have seen these photos. must property owner treat human like 'not human'?

even animal got animal rights like dog/cat cage cannot be too small or not too many dog/cat in a cage

must property owner partition their unit from 1-to-2, 2-to-4, 4-to-8 to squeeze every drop of the blood out from tenant?

is this govt fault? when i read the news, the tenant commented that if govt crack down these ruthless property owner, current tenant will be homeless and sleep on the streets or under the bridges, actually become worst? 

and they cannot afford any 'decent' place to stay. these cramped apartment is 1-level up (luxury) compare to cage-house

sad ... really sad.

well it all depends on how much you can pay mah......
 

i can rent out 1000sqft unit at $4000 but if each family can only afford $400.. ultimately either my unit don't get rented out or 10 families will pool the rent and rent the place...

You guys do know that HK has alot more land they use as 'nature reserves' i.e. carefully manicured and landscaped spacious parks and huge country clubs for the rich and famous which takes up a huge percentage of the 'used' total gross land area right?
 

They should have hired horseface to convert all that land into dollars in swiss accounts.

Well at least it is still a roof over their heads.
 

You should see the homeless in LA and SF....
 

Our govt's HDB program has been pretty efficient in this respect.
 

In singapore, what people are quibbling over are petty things like location, view, distance to MRT, etc. really small things that only Singaporeans have the luxury of complaining about.
 

Imagine bringing up kids in an environment like that.
 

There was the photo of two kids lying on the top level of the double (triple?) deck bed, the girl was studying with her little brother. That photo made me feel so sad and yet inspired. These people are tough people, going through life with whatever little they have, whichever cards they have been dealt. Unlike singapore, those people have no recourse to their plight, so they grow up fighting hard and doing their best to improve their lives, taking in their stride whatever s--t life throws at them.
 

I think these are the kind of new citizens that Lee Kuan Yew wants for Singapore, people with "spurs in their hides".

if there's anyone that fared worse than MBT, it's the previous chief executives of HK
 

for more than 10 years, they failed to supply lands and build public housings
 

very often, the good parcels of lands were monopolised by their powerful property developers, and the old strata-titled buildings could not be demolished for new flats
 

there are more than 200,000 HK people still on waiting list for a public flat
 

the current chief executive Leung chun Ying is trying to solve this problem, but given his unpopularity, will the HK people give him enough time to do it?

Agreed. Sadly HdB's programme has departed from its original aim:- to provide low cost,  affordable public housing. It swings towards providing near perfect "imitations" of private condo with increased prices. The so-called catering to sandwiched class buyers may well be a plot to win votes from this group of buyers.  
 

By tangling and promoting such condo-lookalikes flats, one generation of buyers have been  "drugged" to take buying/owning this as their birthright.  Can't they start with something more practical like a 3 or 4 room flat when their families are small and income not too high? 
 

I could be wrong though

I think in every country there will be people who fall through the cracks in a capitalist economy and society.
 

What I cannot stand is people who live in relative luxury compared to the homeless in the west and the caged apartments in HK and yet still find things to complain about.  Yes it is human nature to give into impulse of greed and want something bigger better nicer, but seriously, just work harder to attain it and don't expect handouts.
 

With regard to adoption. 
 

How many can I adopt?  Will they want to be away from their parents? They are not orphans. They just damn unlucky that's all, to be born into a poor background. Not a crime.
 

What is more effective will be the wealthy philanthropists in HK setting up funds to help those people there. This has to include powerful businessmen lobbying in their parliament for better public apartments to house these people to a decent human standard.
 

The problem is many of HK's wealthy and successful may have also come from poor backgrounds similar to the people's in these photos and their attitude may be "if I can make it in life, so can you."
 

This is also the same attitude displayed by many of our civil servants in singapore. Because they believe in an extreme form of meritocracy, they tend to approach the poor in singapore with attitudes such as "if you are poor, it is your own fault (or your parents' fault).
 

I believe in meritocracy also, but I am of the opinion that no child deserves to grow up like that. They did nothing wrong. If the parents are drug addicts or gamblers whose actions caused their family to end up this way, why should the children bear the consequences?
 

You think I don't feel sad when I see children from poor backgrounds in singapore?
 

I am speaking from a humanitarian perspective. All I said was LKY likes these people and want them to come in.  Not intending to turn this into an immigration issue.

My good friend's cousin:  parents drove him real hard.  GEP, RI, RJC, SAF officer during NS, on track to prestigious university program after ORD.
 

One day he just snapped, hammered his girlfriend and his parents, went to the top of HDB and jumped.  No girlfriend problems nor financial problems.
 

Not sure how much his hard-driving parents contributed to his suicide, but I have heard of parents slave-driving their kids into the GEP, sending them to GEP prep courses to "train" them to score high on the GEP streaming exams, even when their kids were naturally not of GEP calibre.  I think it goes against the whole idea of the GEP.  After getting the kid into GEP, the parents become really disappointed that their kids hover around the bottom of the class academically.  And their kids' self-esteem, already crawling on the ground after months of being surrounded by truly/naturally gifted students, sinks even lower contributing to clinical depression and/or irrational behaviour.

Your cousin's frd son story is very bad. I think for his case, it was simply all work and no play.
 

Notice the " " which I put over the word slave drive  . I used the word "slave drive" cos when compared to my frd's kids of the same age, he is doing much more academic work than them. 
 

What we're doing are just short daily activities like writing / reading / arithmetics / memory training etc which takes up 30 min each day. The activities are done in a manner which is fun and honestly, he looks forward to it. After that, he is free to play his toys (didn't I mention he has enough toys for a child care centre?  ) or watch TV. So there is a balance of learning and playing.
 

One thing which we don't allow him to do is to play with our iPhone or iPads. It makes kids addicted to the gadget, not to mention have poor social skills.

when he is 4yrs old????????



 

My wife and I are very lucky and thankful that he is naturally bright and intelligent.  He is very inquisitive and curious. So there is no way to keep him satisfied with the usual toys and simple ABCs. That's why we started setting aside 30 min each day on learning. It can be writing / memory training / simple maths / reading / simple general knowledge etc. Things to engage him and stimulate his mind. 
 

I know i might sound a bit hao lian here but why hold back if your kid is showing academic potential? Instead, strive to give them more and satisfy their thirst for knowledge. I'm not wishing for him to be of GEP calibre. Just hoping that he will will the top 25% of the cohort that's all. hahaha.
 

I'm a strong believer that if the kid is not smart, then no amount of "forced learning" will benefit them or make them smarter.
 

Of course we balance it out by giving him time to play, to be a toddler, running around etc. In fact, one of the requirements which I had when sourcing for a child care centre for him was to ensure that the school has an out door playground when he can mess around in the sand/grass and not coop up in a room all day.

Yup.. I know. My friends and family were shocked too.  
 

But that's because we "slave drive" him on his academic front. So the TV and the scv kiddy channels are a form of "reward" for him when he does his work well.



 
 

you did not!!  :angry: :angry:

he should also be glad that his parents give him a good exposure right from the beginning, and you have put in a lot for his development, please dun expect too much and he will know what to do in future.  
 




My wife and I are very lucky and thankful that he is naturally bright and intelligent.  He is very inquisitive and curious. So there is no way to keep him satisfied with the usual toys and simple ABCs. That's why we started setting aside 30 min each day on learning. It can be writing / memory training / simple maths / reading / simple general knowledge etc. Things to engage him and stimulate his mind. 
 

I know i might sound a bit hao lian here but why hold back if your kid is showing academic potential? Instead, strive to give them more and satisfy their thirst for knowledge. I'm not wishing for him to be of GEP calibre. Just hoping that he will will the top 25% of the cohort that's all. hahaha.
 

I'm a strong believer that if the kid is not smart, then no amount of "forced learning" will benefit them or make them smarter.
 

Of course we balance it out by giving him time to play, to be a toddler, running around etc. In fact, one of the requirements which I had when sourcing for a child care centre for him was to ensure that the school has an out door playground when he can mess around in the sand/grass and not coop up in a room all day.

Hi folks, there is a research paper in the united states library of congress. It is by a SG scholar, it analyses living area, conditions and how it correlates to murder, arson, rape and assorted nasty stuff. Remember bukit ho swee, good thing it is gone, Nasty there. 

In HK, ppl chop the cops.

In SG, mata the man. 

Very different directions, so those LKY bashers and PAP knockers, you better have some respect for the history and work done. Help them, else you can swim or walk, don't matter, just keep on traveling.

Maybe become triad leader in Jalan besar rather than hong lim yapper, the brother and sister picher... Paper bag over the head or bleeding on the street, missing hand or eyeball.

Leaders self determined correct direction. This ethics is what set us apart. 

That is why I am grateful to have learnt to read English.

Search HDB, Singapore in server for United States Library of Congress.

Ironical that I respect my country after reading about it in a foreign land.

Get some 98 in yer head. Stop pumping the 89 s--t. :-) Go Read.

Don't worry about 2030, they said in the white paper we will be 50% less dense than HK.

That means instead of a cage, we will get two cages. 

We are really taken care of.
 

Thank goodness those people who made the policies are more humane than those in HK. Twice of that in fact.

No wonder the policies makers aka ministers here earn double the salary compared with HK ones, or more!

For someone with a durex avatar, I must say good job as a father!  
 

Totally agree on satisfying the kids curiosity and stimulating their thirst for knowledge, without the ipads and iphones.
