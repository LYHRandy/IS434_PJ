Recession? what recession. Condos were sold within days, stock market hits

record high in 10 months. Guess Sg economy will recover positively in this year.
 

But i start to worry about those who needs to buy a decent HDB flat to get married,

they are ridiculously high for new couples. i do see more newly wed couples to stay

with their old folks for a longer period of time. 
 

News for ST today.

PRICES of Housing Board flats have reached a historical record, rising 1.4 per cent in the second quarter this year, reversing a first-quarter dip of 0.8 per cent.
 

Fresh data released from the HDB on Friday shows the resale price index rising to 140.2 - beating the previous record set in the fourth quarter of last year when it hit just over 139.
 

The figures have come in slightly higher than flash estimates released earlier this month which showed that prices rose 1.2 per cent.
 

Sales of HDB resale flats also surged 58 per cent, reflecting improved market sentiment, to reach 10,184 transactions in the second quarter, compared to 6,446 in the first quarter.
 

Year on year, second quarter sales rose 31 per cent compared to the 7,763 units sold in the same period last year. Analysts attribute the healthy sales volume to the economic outlook which has grown more optimistic in the second quarter.
 

Industry observers also noted that resale flats were popular as the cash needed upfront, or cash-over-valuation (COV), to buy a resale flat was low or approached zero.
 

Friday's HDB data showed that the median COV continued to decline, falling to $3,000 in the second quarter, compared to $4,000 in the first quarter.
 

The number of flats which sold above valuation also declined from 62 per cent of all transactions in the first quarter, to 57 per cent in the second quarter.
 

The remaining 43 per cent was sold at or below valuation, said HDB.
 

Meanwhile, rental rates for HDB flats did not register drastic movements. Median sublet rents for two-room and five-roomer flats for the second quarter stayed the same, but fell by $100 for three room, four room and executive flats.
 

Rental transactions increased by 9.6 per cent to 3,862 cases in second quarter compared to the first quarter. But compared to the same period last year, it fell by 6.3 per cent.
 

The total number of HDB flats approved for subletting rose to about 23,200 units as at second quarter, compared to 22,800 units in the first quarter.

To make thing worst, HDB is only building 6,000 units BTO flats (asking for premium

prices). Guess who is the minister in charge. Thank you very much.

mainly because of FT. a lot of FT got the cash and able to pay the after market HBD upfront cash that most of the local singaporean cant afford. they spoilt the market at the moment and create a false scenerio that the economy is picking up.

Yes, it doubled since 1st quarter, but it is still a far cry from pre-crisis period. 

But the scary thing is, HDB median price has returned to peak period. Besides,

share market uptrend does not stay forever, it is speculators at work.
 

heard from some folks saying those who bought condos today are middle income 

earners like administors, engineers, supervisors. So, who are the buyers of HDB??

Low income earners? if so, can they afford a 4 room flat costs >250k, presuming

their individual income is merely below $2400k per year with CPF in ordicnary

account less than $500 per month?

drove past a couple of times and I was speculating $950 psf, but $1150 psf is record breaking liao.....buyers' $$ is surely easy to earn now. Far East will laugh all the way to the bank if sold 70% over weekend. Good facing can ask for more $$ @ phase 2.

This is to "motivate" us to work hard for the rest of our life, buy condo just take 30 yr loan loh...we are like  cows producing milk.
 

look at the price of owning and maintaining a car here, so expensive but ppl just take 10 yr loan loh....same theory. 
 

heh heh, THEY knew that all the cows want status, want face, kiasu, kiasi, kiabo, and they are  
 

sigh... with these "assets", we can easily retired in boleh land before reaching 55yr.

Believe this is a marketing trick to artificially jack up prices by the developer, don't

think they're foolish to know it is an unrealistic price. quite sure that they will reduce

price later, and many would rush to buy. eg, if they reduce to $900psf, many kiasu

will rush to bite the bait......

PR FT are buying up HDB like mad in order to secure their retirement income base on HDB rental.
 

Base on my property agent friend, 8 out of 10 resale HDB are bought by PR FT and they seems quite generous with their offers
 

and yes, they are not going to retire in singapore. my indonesian, malaysian, hongkong and indians associates said so

Then they allow 100% use of CPF ordinary account to pay for HDB flats so that the price keep pushing up

Sounds interesting. But HDB flats cost more than a bargain.

a cool $400k can buy a condo unit in prime area in KL, a landed property in

Jakarta near central. Of course, they do not have a good infrastructure to come with it, but

these 2 places are so close to SG, the comparison of prices is insane.
 

Still seriously think that HDB must take good care of welfare of SGeans who need a proper

shelter, it must be within a good reach of low-middle income earners.

rental income is different i think. loan also not as low as in singpore. 

they are hoping with government quota on building new flats and the policy of importing FT worker, rental can maintain of even rise in the future.
 

then retiring in their home country will be a walk in the park. so far i already know 4-5 couples. 
 

FT and locals "show hand" in order to buy a HDB. meaning no money to buy even furniture in the first 6 months

Bank totally empty

you're right. SG gov knows that about 1 million SGeans will be more than 65 yrs old by Y2030.

Better use their CPF monies now than to vanish in Batam. 
 

some datas i gathered. Y2008, 100k new PRs in SG, private developers have 60k units of

condos in the pipeline, HDB not announcing any new project yet, but mere 6k units in

SengKang/Ponggol/Woodlands. Looks like gov is still trying to jack up prices of property

to sell some lands.

the ST reported that HDB are now more "affordable" due to lower COV as valuation has increased resulting in lower COV.
 

i dunno how true is this because every seller is still asking the same COV!
 

eg: a 3rm value at $250k, COV $15k
 

now value at $260k, supposedly COV shld be $5k. but fact is, sellers are still asking $15k COV.
 

YET, there are still buyers willing to pay. and the vicious cycle repeats; valuation increases, again.

It's more affordable as in the cash upfront you have to fork out. For the scenario you have quoted:
 

Valuation $250, $15k COV -
 

Upfont Cash = $15,000 + $12,500 (5% of Valuation) =  $27,500
 

Valuation $260, $5k COV
 

Upfront Cash = $5,000 + $13,000 (5% of Valuation) = $18,000
 

There's a saving of $9,500 of cash upfront, which can be used for renovation. The difference in the amount that one has to finance being spreaded out over a period of time (10 - 20 years), is also not that significant.

It's the fresh imports of FT that's keeping the demand for rental high now. Eventually some of these FT's will graduate to PR, and start to buy their own pigeon holes. And then new FT's will come in to rent, thus keeping the price of HDB high.
 

For local S'poreans if they are too poor to buy their own piegeon holes, they'll probably rent from the HDB's Transitional Housing Scheme (those 1 room flats), and if they can't really improve their financial situations, they will remain in such housing for the rest of their lives. They will not be able to afford renting directly from HDB owners, as the rentals would be keep high by the steady influx of FT.
 

So my point is, it is highly unlikely S'poreans would rent from private owners, although not impossible. Just that there are probably better choices.

The deal for Sporeans is simple. If you have not already got your HDB flat, quickly get get married, then apply for a pigeon hole. Then slog the rest of your live to pay the mortgage. When it's time to retire, then reverse mortgage the flat to HDB for a pittance to sustain your old age. Do not procrastinate because they (the Govt) will do their darnest to prevent HDB prices from dropping, and the afforability of the pigeon hole will slip further and further into the distance.
 

It's just the harsh realities of life here.

It's just the typical short term thining, the types that counts for 66.6% of the people.
 

What they care and worry about is now and the immediate future. If they wait, price go up how? Can they get a smaller flat? How small can they get?

I think even before yr 2030, a lot of these 1 million aging S'porean will try to cash out their HDB 5 room & exe flats, condo, or freehold....and buy small HDB unit to retire & cut cost....... but by than, the market will be flooded with big houses but noboday will want to buy,  all old S'porean will tio tia with worthless big houses....
 

even now HDB 3-4 rm are more demand that bigger flats.

3 room flats are intended for low & lower middle income groups who cannot afford 4 rm and above types... but if prices of 3 rm flats oso keep going up with the rest of the flat types, then the poor will be poorer as they be pumping more $$$ into the housing loan rather than using it for daily needs.. more poor than ever..

some checks should be in place to prevent those rich ppl from competing with the poor for the housing.

There's an arbituary figure of $8k income ceiling, if your income is above that you can't buy new HDB 3, 4 & 5 room flats brand new. However you can still buy EA or EC, or buy from resale market. Households with income not more than $2,000 and $3,000 can buy brand new 2 or 3 room flats. 
 

There are policies, but rather minimal. Because too much can have other side effects of artificially depressing capital appreciation of HDB flats.

But rental market are also mainly supported by FT / PR right...if all the PR went to buy their own flat..then who is going to rent from them...dont tell us next time we S'prean have to rent HDB flat from PR... sound possible given the continuous escalating prices of our PUBLIC HOUSNG... 



 
 

how many "poor" people are already renting? can't we see the truth?

even now HDB 3-4 rm are more demand that bigger flats.

i shudder to think when they really decide to raise the 8k ceiling. 
 

10K? = oh, more reason to raise 4 and 5 room prices as buyers are getting richer and competing with each other



is the problem with the 8k ceiling or is the problem with HDB prices?

It's just the typical short term thining, the types that counts for 66.6% of the people.
 

What they care and worry about is now and the immediate future. If they wait, price go up how? Can they get a smaller flat? How small can they get?



 

i think like that also.. u know y? cos i have never think CPF is for retirement, i have always think that CPF money will be never seen by me till the day i die. i save my own $$ for retirement. CPF?? just use it for housing lo.. u must be naive to think CPF $$ is for retirement..with so low interest rate, cannot even beat inflation and u call that retirement fund.. what a joke..

part of the reason also.. govt also to be blame for letting the price increase so much..its a basic house not a luxury item yet some have to work their whole life to afford it.. 

with the escalating HDB prices, next time easily 0.5mil for a 4 room then a fresh grad will have to work till he die to afford his hse.. sianz..

the ST reported that HDB are now more "affordable" due to lower COV as valuation has increased resulting in lower COV.
 

i dunno how true is this because every seller is still asking the same COV!
 

eg: a 3rm value at $250k, COV $15k
 

now value at $260k, supposedly COV shld be $5k. but fact is, sellers are still asking $15k COV.
 

YET, there are still buyers willing to pay. and the vicious cycle repeats; valuation increases, again.



 

Yes .. you are right. If gov't really wants to bring the price down .... then they must lower the valuation .... if not what you mentioned is exactly what is happening now.
 

When valuation goes up .... people will think "Oh, valuation went up ... means market good lor. I originally asking COV $10K ... now asking COV $20K."
 

So if gov't really wanna make the price realistic .... lower the valuation.

It's more affordable as in the cash upfront you have to fork out. For the scenario you have quoted:
 

Valuation $250, $15k COV -
 

Upfont Cash = $15,000 + $12,500 (5% of Valuation) =  $27,500
 

Valuation $260, $5k COV
 

Upfront Cash = $5,000 + $13,000 (5% of Valuation) = $18,000
 

There's a saving of $9,500 of cash upfront, which can be used for renovation. The difference in the amount that one has to finance being spreaded out over a period of time (10 - 20 years), is also not that significant.



 

u r right. this is the original intent. BUT fact is, ppl are still asking $15k COV despite the increase in valuation allowing buyers to loan more, less cash.

in fact HDB has said that they dun do valuations of resale flats, it's all done by independent valuers.. so they absolve themselves of all blame for the high valuations.. but then for new flats, they charge the so called 'market rates' which is indirectly pushing up the prices of flats..
 

many times, the public has asked them to release figures on actual costs of development.. can imagine they are the next $$$ making machines for the gov after LTA..

u r right in saying that low income households can buy new 2 or 3 rooms flats...but question is are there simply enough such flats to go around for these families..i doubt so.. HDB is focusing mainly on 4, 5rm developments as these yield higher profits as compared to 2, 3 rooms.. 

and becos there aren't enough new flats for the low income, and resale flats are out of their reach, these low income families gotta rent from gov.

already the gov has allowed the HDB market to be operate like the private residential market. yes, Sporeans can get new flats, but are there enough? nope, so these new couples need to compete with PRs who are coming into the resale market...
 

i got a friend who just married but simply cannot get a flat- balloted many times for new flat but still can't get one.. and not much cash to buy from resale market..so no choice but to stay with parents.

why people buying i duno... but i know this year alot people getting married... including me..... and i bought one is to stay in...... it is possible that other married couples are doing the same too.
 

Also with more FT/PRs coming over.... it is possible some of them are looking for rental yield on their cureent properties especially private and buying a HDB to stay in, thus maintaining the high price.
 

And the other possibility is due to previously (2007 onwards) owners may have taken loans thru banks, if the valulation falls too low, owners may have to top up cash to bank thus if they can't afford, there may be a rollover effect thus pushing the economy towards even worse recession....
 

Of course there are some that are buying due to what you mentioned but i dun think the percentage is high.... in fact most people i know are looking more towards dual property ownership, i.e if have landed, buy a hdb and vice versa.....

actually it will be better for singaporeans that the price in hdb drops by 30%. 
 

Lets put it this way... what will u do if u sell your hdb ?? upgrade right? would you want your new property to be 30% cheaper??? Simple reason, if one is upgrading, it is always better for the property market to be depressed rather than inflated. 
 

Of course, if you are migrating away or downgrading, then u hope the prices will be high high.

Valuation is not dependant on HDB. There are HDB appointed valuers (not HDB employees) who will value properties based on factors like location, direction facing, floor level, amenities, last transacted price etc. Once the valuation is up, rarely does anybody object to the valuation. A very heavy weightage is placed on last transacted price. If the selling price of a neighbouring unit was $260K, most valuers will not deviate too far from that benchmark.

In an indirect way. Pricing of new HDB flats are loosly based on market pricing of resale properties. High resale value give them "excuses" to price higher, which results in higher margins. Then there's also other things like stamp fees, mortgage interests for which there's a positive correlation with price.
 

In short, there's not much to loose for the Govt when property prices are booming, and lots for everybody (including HDB flat owners) when prices drops.
 

Also, there are increasing numbers of HDB flats financed by banks (not HDB). And when prices drops drastically, there's nothing to say the banks will not call the mortgagees and ask them to top up the difference in cash. Once such a thing happen, the snowball effect would be unthinkable.
 

My take is, as long as prices increases gradually and not far outpace economic growth and inflation, then it's healthy. If it drops, it's nothing but trouble. For forummers calling for a drop in HDB prices, do be very careful what you wish for, because you really don't know what you are asking for. It's like asking for the devil to cure your headache, and in return he gives you a brain tumour.

look at the increase throughout the years, it doesnt match with inflation and our salary
 

eg. a block of 3rm flats. each are sold at $150k brand new, NG 67sqm. one block 200 units for instance, total sale is $30million. by any standards today, i doubt the cost price is $30million.

i was using 100sqm as an example. in 1970s, a 4rm HDB apt can cost about 10-20k? over 40 years, the price has went up 20folds and thats the selling price, not the cost. Even if u cmopare the new flats in new estates, they are going at 200K+ for 100sqm. Doing a quick calculation, HDB will take in $40million for a 200 unit flat. quick thinking, does a flat cost that much to build? maybe someone from construction industry can advise

while i understand where you are coming from, these reasons do not justify the increase in prices.
 

the only reason is market forces. resale prices increase. new flat prices have to follow suit and cannot stay put by selling at cost price.
 

if u buy at cost price, 5 yrs later u sell and earn $200k. erm.. if u can earn $200k, why not the gov earn some of it first?

but the prices of new flats are still lower than resale flats.
 

so in order to encourage first timer to buy resale flats, they are given $30k grant. 
 

$10k grant is still valid for both new and resale.

Actually i did a comparsion before i bought my flat.... after the $30k grant... the prices are almost the same... taking into consideration resale one already reno and HDB one is bare. I talking about east side, not familier with north,south and west area. The main difference between the 2 flats is the age.
 

the $10k is for staying near parents, which means if your parents want to sell their flat, they can still do so but have to remain within the 2km (If i rem correctly the distance)

I think is reasonable.... you have only 1 chance at the grant.... why should you have more chances..... and you can always buy resale....

Back in 2005, I opted for BTO, spend 2-3 trips down to HDB, paid the booking fee, specially took leave to select the level i want, in the end the BTO was cancelled and HDB merely refund me the booking fee.
 

In the end have to choose resale flats as all other areas are mostly chinese quota full. I was also given the choice to purchase new flats around Little India. 
 

I'm now staying 20 yo flat, no lift level and open carpark, the plus points are it's more lively and nearby have all the necessary amneities like polyclinic, sports complex, malls, markets, Singapore pool etc. 
 

i dumped in quite some cash to renovate the whole flat, so may not be good or feasible for some, on the other hand I have more sqm and a useless squarish shaped living room.

just to share, over the weekend i went to a friend's house for baby one month party. the house is a one year old hdb 4 room flat at buangkok. 
 

this is the first time i see a basement car park for hdb flats. the car park is under a few blocks, and so can drive to below the block and take the lift up.  i was impressed by this design as i thought only private condo then has this feature. 
 

also, the surrounding was quite nice and it was surprisingly windy.  the 4rm flat was quite small though.

based on what you say, the prices of HDB should go down instead of go up.. while private should go up instead of go down..... demand and supply.... no?




Today, SG population is 4.84million, target is 6 million. our MM said 5 million is realistic.

so, PRs are fast filling up the gap. 
 

But, who are these PRs/FTs? what profession? Who will pay long term mortgage loan?

Is the interest rate remaining so low, what happen if "so called" economy

turns better? 
 

Many questions. Best is live within our means.

In an indirect way. Pricing of new HDB flats are loosly based on market pricing of resale properties. High resale value give them "excuses" to price higher, which results in higher margins. Then there's also other things like stamp fees, mortgage interests for which there's a positive correlation with price.
 

In short, there's not much to loose for the Govt when property prices are booming, and lots for everybody (including HDB flat owners) when prices drops.
 

Also, there are increasing numbers of HDB flats financed by banks (not HDB). And when prices drops drastically, there's nothing to say the banks will not call the mortgagees and ask them to top up the difference in cash. Once such a thing happen, the snowball effect would be unthinkable.
 

My take is, as long as prices increases gradually and not far outpace economic growth and inflation, then it's healthy. If it drops, it's nothing but trouble. For forummers calling for a drop in HDB prices, do be very careful what you wish for, because you really don't know what you are asking for. It's like asking for the devil to cure your headache, and in return he gives you a brain tumour.



 
 

some of the poor (i stress again, not jobless) people are already being left behind, 
 

HDB prices rise but bottom 20% workers pay never rise . The pace is unhealthy due to large amounts of FT flooding the market

Yes, it is unhealthy to have large numbers of FT flooding and cheap-sourcing the market. And there's always a certain percentage of people (call it bottome 20%, 10% or 5%) who despite any efforts by Govt or themselves, are just unable to improve on their lot in lives. For those who still aspire to move up the social-eco ladder, there are opportunities as long as they are willing to work hard. If they are resigned to their fate, then no amount of help can move them. And even if property prices drop another 50%, they still can't afford it.
 

But for the average young couple, frankly it's still an reachable dream. When I got married and my bought my first flat, I was earning just shy of $2k per month. Shortly after marriage, wifey got pregnant and eventually quited her job, leaving me as the sole bread winner. We could had qualified for a 2 room flat, but at that time - about 7 years back, there was only 4 or 5 room flats. We took a gamble and got a 5 room flat, and had next to nothing when we moved in. We DIY'ed all the the renovation, and actually enjoyed it.
 

Fast forward 7 years, 2 kids later, we upgraded to an EA, got a car, and are more comfortable financially. Not because I was smart or extra hardworking. Basically I went with the flow, one thing just led to another and before we knew it we are here and now. Of course there were hard times, and struggles but we pulled through together.
 

So my point is, it is possible to move upward, and HDB flats are still within the reach of any average couples. For the less fortunate ones, there are help and opportunities for them to take, they just have to ask for it.

A general feel I get from the postings here, and elsewhere, is that people like to blame the govt for everything, and expect the govt to fix and control everything that contradicts their personal agenda.
 

Even when people are kiasu, they also blame the govt. When HDB prices rise, it's either the govt's fault for "aritificially" pushing up prices, or the govt is lacking in their duty to keep property prices cheap. If HDB prices fall, I'm sure people will blame the govt for locking them in their now devalued property, and that the govt didn't do enough to keep price stable. When standard of living increases - inevitably prices also goes up, it's the govt's fault for not keeping the country affordable.  When salaries and employment conditions are not great, it's the govt's fault for welcoming FT with open arms.
 

I'm not saying all the arguments are without merits. But my point is if people save their energies which they expanded into complaining, and start to work smarter and better. take ownership of their careers, plan their career / business moves, they may just improve their lot in life, and be able to move up their current income bracket. At the end of the day, just merely complain mitigates the personal responsibility that we all should take over our own fate, which is really counter productive.

some poor (poor, not jobless) people are practically living from hand to mouth
 

i think what we are suggesting here is a basic living standard for all singaporeans rich or poor
 

and the escalating HDB prices main culprit is the liberalization of CPF funds for home loan



 

But it beat putting in the bank now. the interest offer by bank is 20 times lower.

Its not government's fault that HDB prices rises so much. but they certainly created a environment for it 
 

HDB = public housing. 

Leave the fancy stuff to private developers. and let them price it according to their wishes and 

market forces will decide if it is fair
 

They may say that is what the people want (fancy HDBs) but they have already forgotten their aim to provide affordable housing for all Singaporeans.

They should tell those ppl who want fancy HDB to go buy private developments
 

I might be complaining, but i am also taking action (already got property overseas)

i just hope that should i decide to retire in singapore, i can die with dignity.
 

But i agree with you... ppl should take ownership of their lives. work hard and you might have a shot at being successful
 

but for some ppl... climbing out of the shithole is really tough no matter how hard they try.

plus they are not that smart too. just work and work. same pay same job same shitty life.

you may be right. H'ever, many here are lamenting about the public housing for the mass has been 

allowed to float more freely in accordance with speculating market, thus creating a uprising pressure to

the younger generation who want to build their families. 

Not complaining, but lamenting...they have all the right to pour out their feelings or stress openly

without obligation. (that's what this forum is all about). Ultimately, all of us know that whatever we

do, gov (whom we have chosen) still have all the says.

our MM is a realistic man, the world is changing all our thoughts.

i don't recall exactly the date, but there was indication to what SG is moving.
 

==some quote from 

http://yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapor...obs-vacant-sign
 

Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, the prime minister's predecessor and father, said last month that Singapore was previously an Asian society made up of ethnic Chinese, Malays and Indians, but that now "we've got a real rainbow spread". But some say the color analogy is blurred as high-end foreign talent moves in and local labor looks to move abroad. 
 

Official statistics estimate 150,000 Singaporeans, or 3.3% of the population, now work or live abroad. In a 2006 survey, 53% of young Singaporeans said they would consider emigration. Last month, Home Affairs Minister Wong confirmed that an average of 1,000 Singaporeans had given up their citizenship to move abroad every year over the last three years, with many of the departures coming from the same high-end industries the government is bidding to attract foreign talent. 
 

How wide the government is willing to open the door to high-end immigration is an open political question. Mentor Minister Lee recently said: "If we have more immigrants than genuine Singaporeans, you become a different people. We must have that core, at least 65% of people born and bred who understand this place, who are part of this society and who know how we got here and why we must do these things."

Good for you bro.

unfortunate for me & some, the shitty holes (not just one) are just too deep for me to climb.

getting married, taking care of old folks, now forking out larger amount to buy HDB and considering 

risking high interest in the future (from a private bank) is making me sick. 

So clinging to the motto : when the going gets tough, the tough gets going..

I really admire and applaud you, because you are those who have taken ownership of your live, and planned for old age. There's nothing wrong with lamenting, or even complaining. As long as we don't get to far and start blaming everything else for our personal lack of progress, and not taking ownership of our lives.
 

For every society there will be people who despite all the help, are not able to progress. And there will always be a group of people who just fall through the gap. I was one of those once. But for this group of people, if they too have the same aspiration - like a nice 5 room flat, a car, etc, they really have to work at it. If they don't, then they should be contented with their 1 room rental flat. 
 

Frankly, life is much more than persuits like nice home, car, career, money. Sad is the person who looses his soul in the puersuit of such material things.

I understand what you are going through. I have been and am still going through the same thing you go through in life.
 

However a declinning HDB prices isn't going to have any effect on our daily struggles, and in fact may add the the sh&t we are already facing. If one is already committed to a HDB flat (e.g. a 4 room flat at $350K), and the price is declining, every other struggles remain the same, but every month you are paying for a $350k flat which is now worth $290K and keep declining. That is not a desirable thing. And if the Govt hears all our lament, and decide to arbiturarily force all HDB prices to go down, they can if they want to, this would be what happen to more than half of the people. So let's just be very very careful what we wish for, because if our wishes comes true, the results will be ugly.
 

For the young couples starting out, the whole painful truth is they got to be realistic. Go for smaller flats which are not only more affordable, but the value increase will also be much better. For bigger flats like 5 rooms or EA, price increment tend to be much smaller. At the end of the day, it's not the size or type of flat that makes a home, it's the people in the home.
 

I have a young couple friend, just gave birth to a baby. Hubby works at airport and draws less than 1k per month. Wife is not working. They wanted to buy a 4 room HDB flat, but loan was rejected by HDB because they just can't afford to. I even went as far as to offer them a room at my home rent free for as long as they wish, so they can build up their savings and get a flat, but they refused, cos they want "a home of their own near to their parents". To add on to the problem, I feel they are rather immatured in thinking - like many who complains, and are not willing to work hard enough. It's this inflexible and "kuku" mentality that I see alot in young people nowadays.

yes, if gov decide to push the hdb price downwards now, many, MANY will die, from high rise jumoing down or mrt track

However a declinning HDB prices isn't going to have any effect on our daily struggles, and in fact may add the the sh&t we are already facing. If one is already committed to a HDB flat (e.g. a 4 room flat at $350K), and the price is declining, every other struggles remain the same, but every month you are paying for a $350k flat which is now worth $290K and keep declining. That is not a desirable thing. And if the Govt hears all our lament, and decide to arbiturarily force all HDB prices to go down, they can if they want to, this would be what happen to more than half of the people. So let's just be very very careful what we wish for, because if our wishes comes true, the results will be ugly.
 

For the young couples starting out, the whole painful truth is they got to be realistic. Go for smaller flats which are not only more affordable, but the value increase will also be much better. For bigger flats like 5 rooms or EA, price increment tend to be much smaller. At the end of the day, it's not the size or type of flat that makes a home, it's the people in the home.
 

I have a young couple friend, just gave birth to a baby. Hubby works at airport and draws less than 1k per month. Wife is not working. They wanted to buy a 4 room HDB flat, but loan was rejected by HDB because they just can't afford to. I even went as far as to offer them a room at my home rent free for as long as they wish, so they can build up their savings and get a flat, but they refused, cos they want "a home of their own near to their parents". To add on to the problem, I feel they are rather immatured in thinking - like many who complains, and are not willing to work hard enough. It's this inflexible and "kuku" mentality that I see alot in young people nowadays.



 

so nice of you to offer the a room to stay. you are a friend in need indeed.   my place going to have renovation at year end, so, can harbour ?

wah 1k single income family with 1 kid wanna go for 4rm ahhh...  



 

That's nothing bro..... the hubby spent almost half of his take home pay to buy a PSP, on the month before the baby was born...  Further, they are in their twenties, with nothing much in the CPF, even if both are working, their total household income in not likely to be higher than 3k per month.
 

I did recommend them to buy new 3 room flats at Sengkang, but they want to stay near to their parents who live in matured estates. And as we all know, matured estate housing price is   . Want to help them also difficult, because like every other young couples, they have a mentality problem.

they stupid or wat??  

they should just stay with parents for the time being lah, at the same time baby can be taken care by parents. still young, can save, save. 

but thinking back, maybe cannot blame them. if they can think properly or do financial planning, they probably wont have a kid now

just to share, over the weekend i went to a friend's house for baby one month party. the house is a one year old hdb 4 room flat at buangkok. 
 

this is the first time i see a basement car park for hdb flats. the car park is under a few blocks, and so can drive to below the block and take the lift up.  i was impressed by this design as i thought only private condo then has this feature. 
 

also, the surrounding was quite nice and it was surprisingly windy.  the 4rm flat was quite small though.



 

More importantly the flats there are very near to Buangkok MRT.

our MM is a realistic man, the world is changing all our thoughts.

i don't recall exactly the date, but there was indication to what SG is moving.
 

==some quote from 

http://yoursdp.org/index.php/news/singapor...obs-vacant-sign
 

Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, the prime minister's predecessor and father, said last month that Singapore was previously an Asian society made up of ethnic Chinese, Malays and Indians, but that now "we've got a real rainbow spread". But some say the color analogy is blurred as high-end foreign talent moves in and local labor looks to move abroad. 
 

Official statistics estimate 150,000 Singaporeans, or 3.3% of the population, now work or live abroad. In a 2006 survey, 53% of young Singaporeans said they would consider emigration. Last month, Home Affairs Minister Wong confirmed that an average of 1,000 Singaporeans had given up their citizenship to move abroad every year over the last three years, with many of the departures coming from the same high-end industries the government is bidding to attract foreign talent. 
 

How wide the government is willing to open the door to high-end immigration is an open political question. Mentor Minister Lee recently said: "If we have more immigrants than genuine Singaporeans, you become a different people. We must have that core, at least 65% of people born and bred who understand this place, who are part of this society and who know how we got here and why we must do these things." 
 

===unquote



 

but he didn't exactly say the words "if Singaporeans are too poor to live here, they can go live elsewhere." Neither is it found in the source u provided here.
 

If we want to bring down ppl who oppose our views, we must make sure we don't bring ourselves down first by saying things they didn't (perjury).
 

btw, i voted WP. Did u vote SDP? They love to do perjury LOL kidding....don't anyhow quote lah!!! Must check first.

question.  if say you can sell your hdb flat and make a handsome profit (about > $250k, ie. sell price less off purchase price), but will have to buy another which should be about the same price (assuming dont downgrade), then will you choose to do sell, to encash from the profit ? but the bottom line is, there is actually no real profit, but just effectively encashing from one's own cpf account ? pls share your opinion and stand. thanks.

Good for you bro.

unfortunate for me & some, the shitty holes (not just one) are just too deep for me to climb.

getting married, taking care of old folks, now forking out larger amount to buy HDB and considering 

risking high interest in the future (from a private bank) is making me sick. 

So clinging to the motto : when the going gets tough, the tough gets going..



 
 

dun worry bro, i think 60% of singaporean males face the same problem as you. (including me)
 

the other 20% damn rich and 20% damn poor so bo chap ahaha

They are Chinese. The way I see it, wife stay at her mum's home, husband stay at his parents home. The in-laws don't like their respective daugther/son-in-law. Wifey and I felt it's not healthy for the family to be broken apart, so we offerred them. They could pay rental if they can afford, but I rather they save up for their own nest for these couple of years.
 

Anyway, it's all just talk, as they have other ideas.

A general feel I get from the postings here, and elsewhere, is that people like to blame the govt for everything, and expect the govt to fix and control everything that contradicts their personal agenda.
 

Even when people are kiasu, they also blame the govt. When HDB prices rise, it's either the govt's fault for "aritificially" pushing up prices, or the govt is lacking in their duty to keep property prices cheap. If HDB prices fall, I'm sure people will blame the govt for locking them in their now devalued property, and that the govt didn't do enough to keep price stable. When standard of living increases - inevitably prices also goes up, it's the govt's fault for not keeping the country affordable.  When salaries and employment conditions are not great, it's the govt's fault for welcoming FT with open arms.
 

I'm not saying all the arguments are without merits. But my point is if people save their energies which they expanded into complaining, and start to work smarter and better. take ownership of their careers, plan their career / business moves, they may just improve their lot in life, and be able to move up their current income bracket. At the end of the day, just merely complain mitigates the personal responsibility that we all should take over our own fate, which is really counter productive.



 

Agreed   I'm not saying that our govt is perfect but then again, I don't think we should blame everything on them. If you ask me, those darn PROPERTY AGENCIES and AGENTS might have something to do with all the price hikes. We should just sell the houses on our own and put those p****s out of business!

bro, property agents or agency don't have the abilities to push demand for properties. its the demand that push up the price.
 

2006 enbloc pushes the bull rush
 

2007 PRs and new citizens that created a demand for the resale market.
 

2009 its the STI index/bank interest that pushes the growth.
 

its the mindset of singaporean that pushes this upswing of the property market. they felt if banks are giving 1.6% home loan (lower than HDB 2.6%) its a good gain. and if the deposit interest in bank is 0.02% its only makes sense to park the saving somewhere else. so its this sentiments that pushes the market. its not within the power of agencies and realtor to control the market demands.
 

the developer is throwing out they property due to they have (most of them) brought their land in the 06s. so they cant hold much longer as the economy downturn might sour their returns, so they tried to relaunch a slightly lower price comparing to the 2006 and 2007. ppl felt is a drop in price thus throw themselves into the market. and with this drop, the demand growth and resulting the high prices now.
 

they compare the differences $$ from their HDB and the new condos, the gap is minimal during the Q1 and make sense thus many are upgraders. ppl in singapore are "living in the face" ppl. they like condos, the love condos and they must have condos. if their demand is not so strong you think developer will built more condos?
 

the property agents is only doing their job trying to match make the buyer and seller. they dun have the ability to control the market. its the singaporean who created the demand and the upswing.
 

if you want to sell your house with $30K cov, you think the agent can tell you sell below value? so if your agent can sell $100k above your asking of $30k will you still call him p****s?
 

he sell your property high $= good agent

he help you buy your property low $= good agent
 

he sell your property low $= bad agent (but he is helping you to dispose and minimise your losts)

he help you buy higher $ = bad agent (but he is trying to secure a roof for your family)
 

so what you think this property agent will call you?  
 

singaporean alway have this mindset, their finger is never pointing back themselves. if agents can control propety market, bankers can control economy then we will not face this downturn sh*t. many property agents also lost they income during the Q3 and Q4 2008. so if they can control there will not be slide in the propety prices during then if they can control probably many wont have the ability to buy houses now.
 

even Mr Ma can tell you "buyers have to be cautious"
