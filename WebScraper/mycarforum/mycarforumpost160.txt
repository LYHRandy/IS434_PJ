Yahoo news: Malaysia to charge foreigners more for buying houses in Johor-report
 
KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Malaysia's southern state of Johor, which neighbours Singapore, will impose a higher processing fee on foreigners who buy houses, state news agency Bernama reported, as it looks to boost revenues and rein in speculative buying.
 
Bernama quoted the state executive councillor for housing and local government, Abdul Latiff Bandi, as saying the state government will charge a fee of 4-5 percent of the property value. Proceeds will go towards welfare projects in Johor.
 
This compares with the current flat fee of 10,000 ringgit ($3,100) per property.
 
Singaporeans have been buying houses in Johor, especially in Iskandar, which is a 2,200 square km (850 square mile) zone three times the size of Singapore and is just across a narrow strip of water. The strong interest also stems from cheaper property prices and utility bills compared with Singapore.
 
The move also comes ahead of potential new measures by the Malaysian government, such as raising the real property gains tax, in the upcoming budget on Oct. 25 to rein in rising housing prices.
 
Property companies that have exposure to Johor include UEM Sunrise, Mah Sing Group, Tropicana Corp and Hong Kong-listed Country Garden Holdings .

Not too sure how true is this piece of news cause the impact can be quite great...The extra charegs paid by overseas buyers will make them think twice before buying...The impact will go beyond buying to selling as well cause the local are unlikely to pick these premium property so likely buyers of any resale property will likely be another overseas buyer. More often then not, these are probably "Say Say" to keep the local happy as property price is on an incereasing trend.

i think the outright charge is not a big issue..at least it sound transparent. 
 
but that now you need to seek permission to sell your place . If some offical eye your place, then you cannot sell to other except to him at his price.. then die lah. 
 
or they take the longest time to approve it..
 
Remember the time when they confiscated all the singaporean's shares.. * lockup in malaysia* ..
 
when the property prices in malaysia drops, sg also cannot sell.. then die liao. *again*

Buying a unit in Iskandar is a risk to me. The developments surrounding it have yet to be completed but based on their masterplan, this is one area to look out for as a investor. Land cost is cheap now and developers are able to sell their units at cheap price. Once the bulk of the developments have been completed, that's when you will see the real value of your property. 
 
It's all about the risk appetite you are willing to take. There's no guarantee that this will be a successful project

everything is right except the part of "cheap price"
iskandar properties are marketed based on future price
but whether the future would be good is a big IF
anyway, spore govt and private companies have a big BET on iskandar
i don't think "they" will let it collapse but many surely bought at a premium

actually no diff lar,developer can just give you voucher to offset the 4%-5% tax,or even give you discount up to 4%-5% however the price of the ppty will be factor in,looking at the new launch which is rm800-rm1000 guess they can manage/absorde it,if you look at the resale ppty price,guess project like sky executive (refering to apt project)you will still manage to purchase it at abt rm600psf landed one can be somewhere around rm350 psf up subjected to state approval.Buy not for rental or investment buy rather for stay or retirement,if it appreciate it's a bouns.Accordingly to some other sources,by 2017 there will be 57,782 unit in the market (96 condo till date still adding on).Nothing compare to singapore,whereby we will have 200,000 unit complete by 2016.Scary or not?

Good point, I didn't ask but I wasn't asking for Iskandar actually. My comment to him was this measure seems that the government is looking for some Christmas present. That went on to him telling me forget about buying property in Iskandar. He is a native Malaysian and did mention briefly that the pricing is just too high compared to other projects.
 
In other words, some brothers here are correct about the alleviated pricing built into the price. Guess that means not much upside for those who buy now. Those who really made money were those who bought the surrounding properties BEFORE the hype.
 
I'm not a property person; so I just listen

Iskandar is like a growth stock. The current price reflects the potential future growth of that company hence valuatons are always sky high.  For example, TESLA, the electric car maker which has crazy valuations now.  But if indeed everyone will buy a electric car in the future, early investors would have hit jackpot.
 
So when a persom look at iskandar, it's really about how confident that iskandar will pan out as planned. I think they will eventually get everything in-place, but it's the duration and timing. And pray that no big investors pull out when they start seeing their schedule gets stretched.

Buying properties in Malaysia is easy but selling is difficult.  I don't buy malaysia properties no matter how cheap they are.  The current property buzz is centred in the western side of JB.  When the prices reach sky high, developers will move to develop the eastern side of JB. Prices in the west will crumble as more properties are built in the west.  Therefore, it's too risky to invest in Malaysia's properties, not to mention the crimes over there.  My neighbour just got her car's window smashed when she went to buy food.  All it took was just a few mins to lose her bag in her own car in JB.  She's a regular in JB but too distraught to go there now for the time being.
