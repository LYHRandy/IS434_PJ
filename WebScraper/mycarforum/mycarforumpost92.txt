Looking at your criteria, the best match (Met almost all your criteria) I can think of are those around Flora Drive - Palm Isles, Parc Olympia etc. 
 

IMHO, Palm Isles is a better choice cause it is developed by F&N. Very good quality work; Good free shuttle bus to changi biz park. And also the chairman is the son/brother of 2 famous personalities   :D   
 

As for Parc Olympia, the theme is new, the developer is also fairly new in developing residential projects. So, caveat emptor lah

If I even buy a condo for investment, it must be near MRT.

Looking at the COE and the impending 7million population.

Housing nearer MRT will nap-shot be in high demand.
 

In fact now is good time to buy, knowing full well the gov is still aiming for the 7million population target.

Developers also know that. So whatever expected windfall gains probably creamed off by them already in the form of the high psf price.

 It may be true. But rental will be hot in such locations.

Still can make money.

Because the nearby, not ideal, condos will also priced their psf at the benchmark. As a whole, the psf will only be increasing. Don't say recession. Generally it will go up to cater to the 7million population.

There is no other way that psf will stagnant or drop in land scare Singapore.

your budget is very tight ...

spore condo (average, in term of floor and view) is no $1M no talk

Tks bro!
 

Both near to each other. Is it a good idea to buy condo unit where there are few other condo site altogether?
 

Example like Pasir & Punggol area. I see many of the condo are near to each other. More competitive to sell and rent at higher price?

Can hear lah. But for these 2 new projects, the noise from TPE will be louder than from the runway.



 

For Palm Isles, was told that the developer will leave a little hilllock of 30m wide to act as a natural sound barrier to reduce the noise from the road.
 

Anyway, this is small issue. I still remember when I bought my home @ hillview 3 years ago, friends were telling me is just crazy due to the too-too train and the traffic jams. 
 

After I moved in, the noise of the train is nothing. I can use it to tell the time of the day. And from the noise and horn, I can tell whether is southbound or northbound. After the train stopped running, I kind of miss the noise. 
 

As for the traffic jam, once you stay there, you will know which time of the day to avoid and what are the ways to beat the jam. Where got issue? 
 

Important thing is I bought at S$800K. Now is value at S$1.4M. Mine is 50m away from hillview station. When the MRT starts running, it may value @ S$1.6M or even more.

It all really depends on what you want. Near HDB estate and you will have all the convenient such as wet market, coffeeshop, 4-D shop etc etc. Surrounded by condo and you may have to drive even just to buy the newspaper. 
 

For each family, the priorities are different. With aged parents, they'll want to be near HDB town. With school going children, they'll want to be near bus stop, or MRT station etc

Personally I think location of "The Palette" is really very ideal and its at an affordable price. Even though 2 bedrooms are fully sold, there's still a handful of 1 bedroom, 3bedroom and 4bedroom units left. Some of these have really nice view of the whole water landscape. I'm currently marketing it now. Do let me know if anyone is keen.

I went Flo residence. Most of the 2 units are taken up. For the 3 bedroom facing the HDB flats there are still quite a number left. 
 

Their selling point is the international school nearby.

Looking at your criteria, the best match (Met almost all your criteria) I can think of are those around Flora Drive - Palm Isles, Parc Olympia etc. 
 

IMHO, Palm Isles is a better choice cause it is developed by F&N. Very good quality work; Good free shuttle bus to changi biz park. And also the chairman is the son/brother of 2 famous personalities   :D   
 

As for Parc Olympia, the theme is new, the developer is also fairly new in developing residential projects. So, caveat emptor lah



 

Went to the site of Palm Isles. I find the place is a bit ulu. Too far from Pasir ris mrt. Unless ppl who drive else very inconvenient leh.

Went to the site of Palm Isles. I find the place is a bit ulu. Too far from Pasir ris mrt. Unless ppl who drive else very inconvenient leh.


 agreed. their selling point is it is near beach  just like ripple bay  




I went Flo residence. Most of the 2 units are taken up. For the 3 bedroom facing the HDB flats there are still quite a number left. 
 

Their selling point is the international school nearby.
 

Really dunno if punggol is worth investing... Many new condo and EC.


 but their 3 and 4 bedroom floor plan look odd to me  

next to consider to river isles - the weird guys only advertisement    did you check out Parc Vera at hougang ave 7 .. the last time i went they only run out of 4 bedroom..all others till available but MRT station not near

Which new launch Condo is good for investment?
 

Considering
 

1. To rent after TOP or sell at profit in few years time

2. Location like near MRT or internation sch or biz park

3. Less than $ 900 psf

4. Price less than $850K

5. 2~3 bed rooms



 

can consider summerdale (Jurong) near MRT track lolx (but not new, can get immediate rental if you buy ready ones)

but not too far from boon lay mrt (1 bus stop or walk 12mins)

I think that Punggol is definitely an up and coming town.
 

Government seems to be pouring alot of resources into developing it.
 

Punggol isn't a big town, but there's 8 condos (under construction) and likely 2 more to come. There's also 6 primary schools, 3 secondary schools and 1 international school. There's also a new food centre/market coming up near the central and also a Safra/Sports centre some where near the waterway.
 

Come 2015, things will be bustling as alot of the BTOs will be built and the mall will be up as well.

Traffic in 2015 would be very much smoother.
 

this is because many people cannot afford to own cars anymore.  
 

I think the capacity of the NE line would need to be increased instead.

errr.. i think you better go survey the morning peak hour crowd on NE line first then talk.
 

Now already many people take backwards from Sengkang and Buangkok to Punggol to ensure they have a seat.
 

Punggol residents not 100% have seats hor.
 

what more to say when the population there grow further.
 

Unless u want to take from Punggol to Sengkang then back to Punggol to chope your seat.

I used to live in Tampines and was a first-hand witness, people board the Pasir Ris train to get a seat while Pasir Ris commuters have to stand  
 

By the time it goes pass Bedok, there were few commuters at the subsequent stations as I think most have already given up on the MRT.
 

Maybe SMRT should consider requiring everyone to alight at the last stop.

For EW line, the depot is at Tanah Merah near the expo, therefore, the first stop for the train after it leaves the depot should be Tampines and not Pasir Ris.  For NE line, the depot is at Sengkang, therefore the first stop is Sengkang and not Punggol.

BUt during peak hours even hav to wait long time for shuttle service right? also heard of condo providing shuttle for first year then scrap service after.



 

The timing of the shuttle service is up to the condo management corporation. It can be every 30mins during peak hours and 1hr during off-peak hours. Whether or not the service will be continued after handing over by the developer is also up to the mgt corp. If majority of the subsidiary proprietors felt that it is a waste of money, then they may vote to scrap the service.
 

The cost to the mgt corp is quite minimal compared to the value that such service can create. It is especially so if you want good rental yield from your condo.

U maybe correct but we're more interested where the commuters can 1st board the train. For eg, the 1st station to board the train for the NE line is Punggol n not Sengkang depot.

The new lines will be much like the existing Circle Line, in not only connecting new towns but also linking commuters from one area to another without having to go through the city centre.

It could be, say, from the eastern or north-eastern end to the south-western end, Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew said in an interview this week.
 

Mr Lui said more details on the new MRT lines can be expected at next year's Budget debate, usually held in March.

I think Punggol is not a good place to invest into condos at the moment - too much hype and people tend to forget about its location.
 

Just have to look at Tampines.  It was a model town back in the 1990s for the world to admire.  Mega malls, improved infrastructure and business hubs later, prices of private properties did not outperform the mass market.
 

I don't think Punggol can do much better.
 

North shore line might sound good but this does not make Punggol more accessible in real terms.  To get to work, most will still take the existing NEL.
 
 
 




I think that Punggol is definitely an up and coming town.
 

Government seems to be pouring alot of resources into developing it.
 

Punggol isn't a big town, but there's 8 condos (under construction) and likely 2 more to come. There's also 6 primary schools, 3 secondary schools and 1 international school. There's also a new food centre/market coming up near the central and also a Safra/Sports centre some where near the waterway.
 

Come 2015, things will be bustling as alot of the BTOs will be built and the mall will be up as well.

ok boy, this is how it goes:
 

the developers, after selling the entire project and at the condo TOP (temporary occupation permit), will appoint a managing agent to maintain the condo.
 

after couple of years at the statutory completion of the condo, the managing agent will hand over the maintenance and running of the condo to the Management Committee which is made up of owners (or the owners' proxies).  These MC members are the ones responsible for the maintenance of the condo from there on.
 

ok?

Landed properties recently went through a big spike in prices.  Have to hunt carefully for value buys.
 

More people think landed properties are value buys nowadays as more people are assessing their psf based on built up area, even for those that need major A&A...  For landed, one really should be calculating based on the actual land size.

After statutory completion, the developers will have washed their hands clean off of the condo.
 

From that point on, the responsibility of the condo's maintenance, regulations, sinking fund, hiring of the various contractors for maintenance and repair is the sole responsibility of the Management Committee.
 

Most MCs will hire a condo management company (who will in turn assign a condo manager) to oversee the daily running of the place.

the developers, after selling the entire project and at the condo TOP (temporary occupation permit), will appoint a managing agent to maintain the condo.
 

after couple of years at the statutory completion of the condo, the managing agent will hand over the maintenance and running of the condo to the Management Committee which is made up of owners (or the owners' proxies).  These MC members are the ones responsible for the maintenance of the condo from there on.
 

ok?




ok boss, sorry i am a poor peasant and does not have a condo 

Thank you for the guide

Driving a mama-papa-sponsored A8 and wearing a mama-sponsored Rolex does NOT give you the right to shoot your mouth off at things that you don't know about. 
 

I have met my fair share of rich and ignorant Chinese-Indonesians like you who feel that they are qualified to talk business with people who HAVE seen the real world and HAVE done the real work.  Just ask any client advisor on indonesian desk who has had the misfortune of dealing with rich spoilt unreasonable ignorants like you.
 

Other than a few notable wealthy Indonesian industrialists who have had real impact on the corporate world, the rest of you are just fat opportunists and parasites leeching off of the poor natives and natural resources of your adopted land.

Most of you second and third generations of Chinese-Indonesians will be working in factories and low-end office jobs if not for the fact that you have family wealth behind you.
 

Of all the Indonesian friends I have, only a few that I respect. One of them is the daughter of a HK listed company whom I met at an academically elite west coast university. She is smart, she got in on the back of her good grades. She really paid her dues in the working world as well.
 

The rest, nah, everybody else despises them but don't want to say only.

1st I am not that rich as you think, its just my family prefer to buy car over house

2nd I maybe ignorant but not in the future, and so what to people who HAVE seen the real world and HAVE done the real world? So what? is it big deal? Earning big bucks maybe goal for everyone but not the meaning of living.

3rd What you might have seen the Indo Chinese and what you have sucks their money might be from poor natives and illegal natural resources of Indon
 

BUT even if we do have the money, its just from hard earned work and perfectly in legal mean. You cant judge a person from a knowledge that they have, a person with deep knowledge doesnt mean they are great in creating impact to business world but its just they are good in leeching people's money in formal way that wear in suit. What important thing is what made up of your personalities and the conscience that you have for others.
 

Sorry to offend anyone here but that person could be you as well.

Bro, if rich people with lots of cash decides to buy property instead of cars.. then less rich ones wouldnt stand any chance of buying liao.

Landed properties recently went through a big spike in prices.  Have to hunt carefully for value buys.
 

More people think landed properties are value buys nowadays as more people are assessing their psf based on built up area, even for those that need major A&A...  For landed, one really should be calculating based on the actual land size.



 

Landed is good for own stay. Rental would be difficult? I think.

I think Punggol is not a good place to invest into condos at the moment - too much hype and people tend to forget about its location.
 

Just have to look at Tampines.  It was a model town back in the 1990s for the world to admire.  Mega malls, improved infrastructure and business hubs later, prices of private properties did not outperform the mass market.
 

I don't think Punggol can do much better.
 

North shore line might sound good but this does not make Punggol more accessible in real terms.  To get to work, most will still take the existing NEL.



 

Which condo are you referring to ? Looking at the map, Tampines only have one condo (The Tropica)  and that's located beside Temasek Poly.
 

There are 3 new condos in construction but none of them near the Tampines central.
 

Property is a long term investment and the people that invest in Punggol right now is looking at the future, not the present. There has been false start with regards to the Punggol 21 vision but from what I have seen so far, the vision is now much closer to reality. Come 2015, the Punggol Central area will be bustling. 
 

As long as government is willing to put resources into developing an area, it will be viable. Look at Kovan, 10 years ago, it wasn't that bustling but now property price there is > 1k psf.
 

Anyway, verdict is not out yet, you may be right and those that invest in Punggol might regret later.

Bros, better don't buy sub-urban condos now unless it is for your own stay. So many years watching the market, I never seen sub-urban prices so close to prime districts apartments. If it is for investment/rental, buy something cheap in prime district and rental have higher chances to cover when interests go up. But next 2, 3 years think property will not drop hard...just maintain or inch up. So for own stay just decide, buy and enjoy.

dun be fool by developer saying that cos' it got university, industrial/business park..the place will be a boom town. Look at NUS/Science Park. The condos along the West Coast near old ginza only gottn attention in the recent yr when the pty boom. Before that, even though it's near NUS/Science Park/Old Ginza, not many exec that work in Science Park want to stay there. Generally, they prefer Holland area where all the buzz are.  So you think abt it, if exec that could afford and work in changi biz park, they rather stay at East Coast , Marine Parade. Those that cant, will stay in tampines/simei HDB. thus, making demand near or next to the biz park .. to be mid risk. Those away at punggol, sk with huge supply coming up is under big risk category. 
 

For Jurong East, i think the parc oasis area may be good.. because they going to have quite alot of entertain activities in that area.

I believe those that stay at tampines are those that bought their place in tampines or renting hdbs.

While those renting condo , are living nearer to the coast. Buy to stay most impt is "affordable". Rent most impt is "accessiblity",not only to work but to airport , town and party places.. esp when the different btw renting east coast is only a couple of hundred different from tampines ( condo) .
 

Okay .. maybe i am wrong... but to me , it's risky to bet on what the developer says.. i rather get flamingo valley for the matter.

Column in room is not finishing, it's poor design, layout. If using $2-3 tile for $1700 psf condo, thats cheap finishing. Partitions as wall, now that is unacceptable. But by partitions, do you mean thin walls or they use those gypsum boards?

when i knock on the wall... it feels more of gypsum boards rather than thin walls.... because thin walls will still feel solid

If you drive to CBD it's super convenient. Just drive along main road and turn into ECP and wah la.. in CBD liao. If you take public transport ... maybe not. But that you are hoping to rent to higher salaried exec right?  If you are high salary expats that keep flying ard, Changi also very fast reach.

Personally I think location of "The Palette" is really very ideal and its at an affordable price. Even though 2 bedrooms are fully sold, there's still a handful of 1 bedroom, 3bedroom and 4bedroom units left. Some of these have really nice view of the whole water landscape. I'm currently marketing it now. Do let me know if anyone is keen.  



 

Please PM me your number. 

Looking at large units or penthouse. 

Thanks

Condo near top primary school.

As time goes by, living within 1 km of school to get in is rubbish....with the amt of alumni enrolling their kid back to the school, there's is no free slots for non alumni kids

True, i was looking at the statistic for this year P1 registration. Rulang Pri only 10 vacany for P2B and 10 for P2C. Very soon one day this school will have no vacany for P2B and 2C. Maybe by 2015. Stay within 1Km also useless.

FH only hold their value better against another 99 LH condo if that 99LH approaches 30 years of age.  otherwise, this sentenece is misleading.
 

value of condo is always a function of rental even if the owner buys for self stay.  it is a fact condos near MRT appreciate more and most of those near MRT are 99 LH.

We had CM1 to CM5 and after all the CM,
 

the price keep rising to a record high,
 

what make you think CM6 will cause prices
 

to fall?
 






Within first month after a CM was triggered everyone was waiting for one anothers to make the first move, even developer also unsure of the response.

At this point price may remain or drop, probably more discount like the reimbuse of stamp duty, but once the orders start picking up then developers will increase their price.

I believe rightly or wrongly that there is only one reason
 

why prices keep going up eventhough we had all the CMs.
 

And the reason is very simple,
 

we don't have enough homes.

It may means that quite alot of singaporean/PR are homeless still. They are just grabbing what they can cos' the mkt does not seem to go down alot.
 

hmm.. interestingly, yesterday China reported increase in property buying.. look like the inflation is still the story of the day.. Prices may continue to raise despite poorer econ outlook.
 
 

hmm.. interesting with all the retrenchment.. unemployment rate still remain < 3%.. so i guess nothing much changed.

homeless lah..PR confirmed are homeless because they need to pay extra stamp duty if they buy 2nd one. 

Normally for investment, they go for smaller units. Flora for investment abit kuku leh.. 

1) the rest of the condo are freehold except H/P if for capital appreciation

2) so many condo ard how good the rental will it get.

PC is worth investing as psf is lower than watertown.

It is just 200m away from mrt and also enjoy the same facilities like WT. 

Good buy, best buy, must buy

PC is good though, just slightly further from Waterway Point/MRT and for the price, it is quiet attractive.

I heard from my agent who was on duty that the average selling price is 950 psf for bigger units and around $1xxx to $12xx for the smaller units.
 

Buyers were queuing overnight and to get one unit, have to queue for 4 hours ! 5 room units sold out !

People won't anyhow buy lah. Timing is everything. Punggol took about 20 years to reach where it is now and still need another few more years.

Yeah ! It is crazy ! Still remembered during the financial crisis, many saying that property market will crash etc but the price only went down for 2 QTRs and then it bounced back with vengence !
 

I think most did not factor the low interest rate and also the fact that government open the door to foreigners so there's demand.

One of my relative bought Kovan residence unit at 900K+, during TOP agent told him can sell at 1.3M.




Same my relative bought newton suite 3 bedder for 1.3m and when TOP, it was valued 2.4m, now i think about 2.5-2.6m moreover his one is 20+ floor facing city

Though the condo is popular but i didn't expect price to go up 2X

That's alot of premium for each floor and I don't think you can see anything even on the top floor right ? Means the difference between top floor and lower floor is up to 400k ?

Comparing ATT, PC, WT and some other D19, D18 or even Flora dr PC is not apple to apple comparison.

Parc Centros finishing are tiles at living room flooring n bathroom walls, no fridge n dry/washer.

WT is ex but come with marble for living room flooring n both bathrooms walls, fridge, washer/dryer, micro wave, coffee mixer, rain shower and sunken bath, Patio units do have wine chiller and clothes hanging machnism.

Both Parc C n WT also not apple to apple comparison.

Somehow I have an impression that Punggol is just as far as Woodlands.
 

And Pasir Ris is like Tuas or Jurong West ext in terms of distance.
 

Even if there are expressways from these towns to city, surely there will be jam and jam and jam during the journey especially peak hours.
 

How to take that everyday?
 

Or maybe people in these town are prepared to take public transport?   
 

I got a feeling that most families rush to buy places like that is because it's a condo and it is relatively cheaper than most other towns.
 

And for daily transport issue...think about it later. Grab the property first.

In SG, anywhere will be jammed up during peak hrs....at least if you buy a condo near mrt, you can take the mrt to town or your workplace.........you buy in places that are near town but are you prepared to pay for the prices? Nwaday hdb is not cheap also....prices in bt merah can be as high as $750k for 4rm flat....which is like a compact 3 bedrm condo in punggol....size is about the same...

Appliance dun cost much but if it's build in then it will be good.

Comparing same location then can use appliance to justify the price.

In SG, anywhere will be jammed up during peak hrs....at least if you buy a condo near mrt, you can take the mrt to town or your workplace.........you buy in places that are near town but are you prepared to pay for the prices? Nwaday hdb is not cheap also....prices in bt merah can be as high as $750k for 4rm flat....which is like a compact 3 bedrm condo in punggol....size is about the same...



 

agreed... must have contingency plan just in case car is really out of reach at least MRT station is nearby

usually rule of thumb is the bigger the development, maintainace fee will be spread more wide. PArc Centro got 620 units, if below 300 should be for 2 bedder onwards

Parc Olympia 5th floor for a 3 bedder compact (990 sq ft) ~$830K after 15% discount




Thanks. Perhaps, this is the reason why it is selling fast.

And somehow, I find Parc Olympia's marketing is better than Palm Isle.
 

Public transport is really bad there. But if one drives, TPE and PIE are just 2 junctions away. Very short queue. Those beach side condos in Pasir Ris.... about 10 traffic lights junctions to get to the expressway.

Actually, I dont understand why buyers go for big projects? They build 1 or 2 badminton courts for 400, 500 units? If one household book the court for 2 hrs each, you have to Q for months to play again? Some mass market condo only have 1 mid size pool for 700+ units, if everyone dip theie feet in, the pool will be emptied....said condo is located in the west side...newly top...

why UBS always say this kind of BS?
 

RESIDENTIAL property prices might fall 10 to 15 per cent in the next 12 months, a new report said.
 

UBS said last week that while the market has remained resilient despite the Government's cooling efforts, it is near a tipping point.
 

This forecast is, however, considerably more pessimistic than other experts' views, which mostly predict either stable prices or smaller falls of up to 5 per cent.
 

But it is still less grim than estimates last December when experts said prices could correct by as much as 30 per cent on the back of that month's cooling measures.
 

While UBS acknowledged that tight residential supply and low interest rates are keeping prices resilient, it said other factors point to a more cautious outlook over the next 12 months.
 

For instance, Singapore's economic growth, while still recovering, is more uncertain now.
 

The Government's residential property cooling measures are also likely to continue to discourage foreign buyers and resale market activity.
 

The proportion of private residential homes bought by foreigners and companies has fallen from 20 per cent last year to 7 per cent in the first half of this year.
 

Meanwhile, the population growth rate has also slowed and is likely to decline further given the recent tightening of immigration policy.
 

And while the supply of homes is still tight, the expected ramp- up from next year onwards should help to compensate fully for the earlier supply shortage by 2014 or 2015, the report noted.
 

UBS expects 140,000 to 150,000 homes to be completed from this year to 2015, higher than its estimated cumulative supply shortfall of 90,000 units built up from 2000 to 2011.
 

This mix of negative factors has turned the bank sour on the property market's prospects, leading to its prediction of a 'moderate' 10 to 15 per cent correction.
 

'Property developers still have strong balance sheets, which may lower the probability of their having to significantly lower the prices of their residential projects to generate cash flow.
 

'We currently see a higher risk for mass-market private homes (versus prime ones) as this segment has largely led the current recovery, and (is likely) the bulk of private residential supply over the next few years,' the report said.
 

Private home prices inched up 0.4 per cent in the second quarter, according to preliminary estimates, reversing a 0.1 per cent dip in the first quarter.
 

Credo Real Estate executive director Ong Teck Hui, however, disagreed with the report's estimates.
 

Assuming no major events globally, he expects prices to move marginally, either up or down, similar to previous quarters.
 

'For prices to correct 10 to 15 per cent, they will have to fall about 2.5 to 4 per cent every quarter from now. This means that something serious has to happen and we should be experiencing some softening but we haven't seen that,' he added.

Bank layoffs hit high-end Hong Kong rents
 

HONG KONG - The chill winds blasting through financial markets have hit rents for luxury properties in Hong Kong as banks lay off high earners and international companies cut back on expatriate packages, property brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle said on Monday.
 

With luxury homes costing HK$100 million (S$16.2 million) or more, rental yields for high-end homes already yield less than 2 per cent, a return set to dwindle further.
 

Hong Kong has the most expensive office and retail property in the world. According to Knight Frank, only London's Knightsbridge neighborhood commands dearer rents than Hong Kong.
 

It costs US$25,000 (S$31,500) per month to house a CEO and his family in a 3,000-square-foot home in the city's traditional luxury neighbourhoods, the Peak and the south side of Hong Kong island, the rival brokerage reported last week.
 

Housing the same family in a Knightsbridge costs US$30,000 a month.
 

Jones Lang Lasalle, issuing a mid-year report on the state of Hong Kong's property market, saw rentals at the luxury end falling 4.2 per cent in the second half, after a 7.5 per cent fall in the first half.
 

Multinationals have been cutting back on expensive expatriate packages and increasingly prefer to hire employees on local terms. With the company no longer paying expensive rents directly to a landlord, employees often opt to keep some of their allowance and make do with a smaller home.
 

The hard times in the financial sector is also seen reining in a runaway market. Hong Kong property prices have risen 9 per cent in the first half, to stand around 50 per cent higher than they were at the start of 2009, with luxury homes showing the fastest gains.
 

Economic uncertainty has however hit demand, with transactions in the city down 25 per cent in the first half compared with the same period the year before.
 

"You will see a dramatic stop in growth in luxury capital values," Mr Joseph Tsang, Hong Kong managing director for Jones Lang LaSalle, said, with at most a 2 per cent increase in values for the second half of the year. "People will wait and see." REUTERS

"Experts" always make predictions.
 

You never hear them say after the event that "they were wrong".
 

So where are the experts now that said price will fall 30%!
 

Success has many fathers, failure is illegitimate.

Same my relative bought newton suite 3 bedder for 1.3m and when TOP, it was valued 2.4m, now i think about 2.5-2.6m moreover his one is 20+ floor facing city

Though the condo is popular but i didn't expect price to go up 2X




Newton suites is a award winning project.. if its not the priciest condo in newton novena, it is one of the top price ones.

Yr relative very very fortunate as if he used 1.3m n bought the surrounding one, today's value is 15% lower than newton suites.

second that.  at start of the year, many gurus predicted a great drop in property prices.  so many of us were waiting to cash in on such a drop.  but look at now, the drop has not materialized but it has even appreciated further in certain sectors.
 

all the gurus are simply not comprehensive enough to analyse all the trends available.  one thing i find they didn't predict/analyse well enough is the liquidity part and the sentiments part that is the reason why the drop didn't materialize and confounded the doomsayers.

Agree with you.
 

If you look at the mass market property, prices has gone up but it is due to many factors.
 

There's not many investment that is safe and in Singapore, property is considered relatively safe. Property is seen as a good hedge against inflation and with the interest rate low, there's alot of liquidity.
 

Prices of new launches keep creeping up but this is also due to the price that the developer paid for the land and the labour cost. 
 

Look at Parc Centros, the big units are sold out leaving the 1 bed room units. This means buyers are occupiers instead of investor/speculator as they tend to go for smaller unit where quantum is low and hence ROI is higher.
 

Economy doesn't look good but if you have cash, where would you rather park it ? In bank earning 0.25% interest, underneath your pillow or in shares where you potentially can lose your pants and more ?

think many of us have gone down that buying-selling route in the past few years thot we got the bestest price and timed the mkt super zhun. onli to find out that someone else sold at even higher price a month later....  that's how many agents work, use last done (whether unit facing rubiish bin or not) as the 'bank valuation' and add a premium. so it goes up, up, up. heard of many cases of ppl who sold off earlier and rent while waiting for the guru predictions to come thru eventually kena priced out or land up paying even more.

yep. you are damned right.  saw so many of such case.  and in my most recent buying experience, i experience the same type of valuation technique used by banks/abetted by agent.
 

when i first look at particular development last done around 900k for low floor units and around 930-960k for high floor units. so when i saw a few low floor units, earlier on i was tempted to offer around 930k because the last done prices are averaging 950k (high and low floor units averaged). the low floor unit refused to sell me cos they say their valuation is 950k but when i show them the low floor units all average only 900k and it only looks higher because it was averaged out with a high floor unit.  seller/agent still refuses to accept my line of reasoning.
 

then i approach the high floor unit sellers thinking if i up my price to the averagely last done for high floor units of about 950k, they would accept my offer.  but still the high floor owners refused to sell at such price!  the reason they cited is the valuation is 1.05m.  i then showed them the caveated prices and units and show that the high floors last done prices only averaged 960k they shouldn't ask much more.  then they say valuation reflects their unit is premium plus low floor unit already sell 950k so high floor must sell above $1m!
 

basket, used the high floor last done prices to push up valuation for low floor unit and then put a premium on high floor units over those low floor unit valuation!

Everyone want to buy cheap.. sell high..

Really depend on the mkt. If seller can hold for a high price, the will of course hold lah.. And buyer desperate to buy, then they will concede.
 

the problem now is that there are more desperate buyers than desperate sellers.. So the prices will be pushed higher and higher.. Seller can wait.. buyers are afraid they may missed the train, just hop on when the price "seem right" .. So no way it's going down..

Let see how the next few mths pan out.. if number of buyers that see the house and offer dwindles, i believe sellers will be more willing to let go.

If Sellers get 5-6 buyer coming to view each wkend.. who will lower their asking?!?

Everyone want to buy cheap.. sell high..

Really depend on the mkt. If seller can hold for a high price, the will of course hold lah.. And buyer desperate to buy, then they will concede.
 

the problem now is that there are more desperate buyers than desperate sellers.. So the prices will be pushed higher and higher.. Seller can wait.. buyers are afraid they may missed the train, just hop on when the price "seem right" .. So no way it's going down..

Let see how the next few mths pan out.. if number of buyers that see the house and offer dwindles, i believe sellers will be more willing to let go.

If Sellers get 5-6 buyer coming to view each wkend.. who will lower their asking?!?



 

i know what you mean.  i am not disputing that sellers need to fetch high prices for themselves.  but what i offer is fair close to what the last done transactions have reflected.  that's why that condo no transactions for the last few months - sellers want to based on valuation prices that were jacked up by events happening elsewhere in other developments like sky habitat while buyers see it is a huge jump from last done prices to artificially high valuation prices.
 

if they want to try for higher prices should have been upfront rather then have the agent hold on to my offer for 5 days and then tell the agent my offer price is 100K too low!  wasting my time and opportunity cost in another condo i may have bought during these 5 days hanging on to my offer.

yeah......his agent gave the indication that 950k is acceptable offer after I reasoned with him.  and he held on for 5 days.  if he come back to ask for 980k, i would have not grumbled and either agreed or negotiate further.  but he said he wanted close to 1.05m.  thsi is a waste of time.
 

because of his holding on to my offer for 5 days, i almost missed out concluding the deal for my second choice unit.  in the end i have to hastily meet the asking price of the owner of my second choice unit.

Really waste of time. Some sellers are even worst. They simply have no intention to sell and is only interested to snare some big carrots. While looking for a place last year, I saw an ad which was placed by the owner himself. Selling price was 1.2 million (negotiable). Called him up and even without any greetings/pleasantries, he asked me what is my budget. I was thinking ,"Why should I tell u my budget?". So I asked him why he asked this question and he said he is not considering any offers below 1.5 million. So i said, okay then and hung up. Right away, he sent me an SMS which is a basically an ad of his place. No idea why he did that but it was full of grammatical and spelling errors. Really waste of time.
 

Anyway, I found a place 2 days later which is just a street away from him for 1 million. He finally sound his place 8 months later at 1.25 million. Not much higher from his listed price.
 

Had a funny experience when I attempted to view another place. The owner had rented out his house to a FT and his family. While arranging to view the place, the agent said it is rather difficult cos the tenant doesn't like strangers and asked me if i could view it from the front door. I was like "what"? I'm buying a house leh... not buying some t shirt from a blogshop. So I gave this place a miss.
 

I agree with what Jrage said in that currently, buyers are generally more desperate than sellers so if you kenna some a--hole sellers, then just suay loh.

hmm... understand your frustration. However, there is a high chance that person that play you out is not the seller but the agent..
 

Maybe agent told owner can close at 1.05m, but told you that owner will probably close at 950k so that ppl will come to view the house. When your offer is made i.e. 950k , agent know that he has a genuine buyer at hand.

He will ask the seller if he's willing to sell.. Seller say no.. then agent will NOT tell you immediately.. he will look for other units and see if he could "sell" you... cos' you are a confirm catch already.. 
 

He will need a few days to ask ard if other agent willing to co-broke or unit willing to lower price. After 5 days, still cannot find. He ask you for a higher no. to back to seller..

He then tell seller , you are a genuine buyer and that he shld sell... Seller then go back and consider.. cos' it's closer to 980k.. 1 day later.. wah la.. Still a no. 

Too bad .. for the agent.. But at least you are not angry with him.. and he knows he got a "buyer" at hand! :) and a more desperate buyer.. because wasted your 5 days. :P

yeah, i mean i was already quite cool because i know how this industry work (holding on to offer, looking for comparable units to offload to genuine buyer).  but i do respect some professionalism to make the process less unpleasant for anyone involved in it.  of course, i don't know whether it is the agent or seller who was overcome with last minute greed.  that's why i also dont really respect agents much.  they either don't know their seller well or they play out their seller.  either way is very bad.

For condo, i dun think you even see the day. the building probably give way by the 30th yrs.. and it may unpleasant to stay anymore. 
 

Depends on location lor. If the location is prime e.g. near mrt. by 30th yr.. you shld see the plot ratio increase , making it worthwhile for developer to buy over the land. If you are talking abt 99-yr landed pty, then you probably will see yourself renting out the place in the final yrs because it's too rundown to stay and not really worth selling cos' price vs rental (rental make more sense)  .... To happened to a few landed pty i read.

yep, i also have my fair share of funny experience with sellers.
 

strangely it is the buyers who are more urgently looking to transact than the sellers.
 

hence that's why my earlier comment about the mistake of analysis of the gurus came about - they failed badly in analysing the property market because they failed badly in analysing sentiments.
 

property prices are not merely a function of quantitative demand and supply (units available, number of residents, prices transacted).  it is as much qualitative demand and supply.  hence the qualitative bit is strongly affected by liquidity and sentiments.

Thats right
 

Most people don't understand what demand is.
 

Demand is not want to buy or wish to buy or thinking about buying
 

it is backing with cash or cheque and doing the actual buying.
 

The only reason prices are going up is not people waiting to buy,
 

it is people actually buying. Hence all the experts saying there will be a 30%
 

correction are wrong.

But things may change soon for hdb.. When more condo esp EC tops in the next few yrs.. HDB upgraders will be selling to the mkt. 

Not so sure abt resale pte mkt. Most pte own-stay pty owner are happy with where they are staying and not so keen to sell even if prices are good.

I read the reports by property gurus predicting that imminent property crash that is coming.
 

I wonder if they ever did a survey ? I know that amongst my friends, none of them are thinking of selling and in fact all are waiting to buy if the prices goes down.
 

Only one friend sold his condo and that's because he want to buy a bigger unit.
 

If everyone is waiting to buy, how can market crash ?

Agree with you.
 

If you look at the mass market property, prices has gone up but it is due to many factors.
 

There's not many investment that is safe and in Singapore, property is considered relatively safe. Property is seen as a good hedge against inflation and with the interest rate low, there's alot of liquidity.
 

Prices of new launches keep creeping up but this is also due to the price that the developer paid for the land and the labour cost. 
 

Look at Parc Centros, the big units are sold out leaving the 1 bed room units. This means buyers are occupiers instead of investor/speculator as they tend to go for smaller unit where quantum is low and hence ROI is higher.
 

Economy doesn't look good but if you have cash, where would you rather park it ? In bank earning 0.25% interest, underneath your pillow or in shares where you potentially can lose your pants and more ?



 

Punggol area seldom got investor bah.....parc centros is because of location...finishings so so only....river isle is good finishings but location nt so gd....

That is why the best is not to give cheque offers and wait for few days. Best is to meet seller face to face. 
 

I really wonder why is everyone rushing to buy when the odds are so against buyers. Buy already cannot sell within4 years. New projects are also with unknown rental yield. By then TOP, the interest rate might not be the same as now. 
 

Will you borrow money to buy stocks that you cannot sell in the next four years?

In the past, each new launch is launched at a higher price enabling the earlier buyers to profit but now it is the reverse.

If you have been to the project hedge park, palm isles and parc olympia, you would hvae notice the above is not true. Hedge park is selling 900+ last year, this year palm isles is selling 800+ and now parc olympia is 820 psf average, If you buy hedge park, congratulations coz you will be buying among the highest leasehold property there
 

Another one is Ponggol

If you see the prices at watertown sold at 1100-1400. Then treasure trove is 900-1000psf then come parc centros and prices around 800-900psf. Not to mention further away like  river isles, flo residences are all much lower at 800+psf max
 

Then also pasir ris area. FEO sell the highest price Seastrand at 1000psf then comes ripple bay and sea esta. ripple bay 800-900psf. Sea Esta also 900+ max
 

So if you buy seastrand, congratulation coz you buy at the highest price and your deposit 20% locked in until TOP, assuming 4 years later. along the way also need to pay interest on the progessive payment until 85%. All this cost with 0 rental returns. Assuming 1M property, 20% loan is 200k stuck. If 4% opportunity cost per year, that is 32K lost opprtunity cost. Next is 65% loan amount assuming average 1% then another cost of 6500 per year and total 26k. So even before TOP, total lost is 58K. If can sell at a profit at 58K, seller should not be happy coz that is breakeven only. All these does not includes stamp duty, agent commission. If sell at same $1M, then confirm lost 58k

You mixed up the sequence. 
 

It is Treasure Trove 1st, follow by Watertown and then Parc Centros.
 

Your comparison is misleading as you are saying that they are all equivalent development when they are not.
 

You already mentioned that River Isles, Flo residences are lower at 800+ psf because of their location.
 

I think the average psf for Treasure Trove and Parc Centros should be similar for units of the same size. You may get certain units of Parc Centros selling for 800+ psf and I am sure that's for the larger 5 BR units. Actually, though Parc Centros might be selling for same psf as ATT, the developer should be making more margin as they paid less for the land compared to what the developer paid of ATT for.

Stock and property are diff. Properties are not liquid unless you buy Reits.
 

Why ppl still buying without knowing the rental amount at the TOP time cos many see the property price has been going higher and higher. The cash in the bank is a waste of opportunity to earn more money.

The smart buyers have already bought,

now comes the "followers".

I hope they can find a seat when the music stops.





 

Actually, some ppl bought and sold and sitting on huge amt of cash.. and dun know what to do with them.. With so much liquidity in the mkt, some started with 1 house, sell , then bought 1 and now buying or bought 2nd/3rd one. 
 

And there are those act smart ones, sold their first house. Now renting or staying with family, and has no choice but to buy once they see a dip because rental is in cash while housing loan can be paid by cpf.. So they need to come back into the mkt before their cash runs out. 
 

But one thing for sure.. most if not all of the buyers know the risk.  Since 2009.. gurus has been predicting that the price will drop .. We also have a few gurus in mycarforum , saying that prices will reverse.. Yet, all these has not materialized.
 

Judging on the leveraging ratio, we have not reach the point when the price will fall drastically. Those that are homeless... better start to plan... :|

The committee may wanna seek for enbloc if the building are too old?



 

calling for enbloc is not a problem... it's the amt that developer is willing to pay for the plot that is the issue. The plot muz worth re-developing, normally only if the plot ratio had increased.
 

anyway, i think for l99, if you use for own stay and it's is enbloc. Owners are in a losing end cos' for developer to buy over, they surely pay only a fraction of the price of a replacement unit of the same size and location.  Freehold, enbloc usually gets a better deal because developer does not need to pay gov to top up lease.

You mixed up the sequence. 
 

It is Treasure Trove 1st, follow by Watertown and then Parc Centros.
 

Your comparison is misleading as you are saying that they are all equivalent development when they are not.
 

You already mentioned that River Isles, Flo residences are lower at 800+ psf because of their location.
 

I think the average psf for Treasure Trove and Parc Centros should be similar for units of the same size. You may get certain units of Parc Centros selling for 800+ psf and I am sure that's for the larger 5 BR units. Actually, though Parc Centros might be selling for same psf as ATT, the developer should be making more margin as they paid less for the land compared to what the developer paid of ATT for.



 

The main point i am stating is that nowadays each new launch is no longer higher then before. In the past, every new launch will be higher than the price for those earlier launch within 1km. flo and river isle are not that far from watertown either. The trend seems to be the opposite as i gave other example such as pasir ris and flora area. Each new launch is cheaper or at most the same price. So there is no easy profit anymore for any and that could also means that the prices have reached a tipping pt. The price i get for parc centros is get for 800+psf is not 5 bedder but 3 bedder and is definitely below 900psf. If the market is good, why parc centros is not sold at even ATT price since developer get the land cheaper? I am sure the developer wun mind earning more. More likely parc centros selling pt is it is cheaper than ATT and Watertown.

There is lots of uncertainty over Singapore Property market, over-supply by 2015 is one of it. Unless our government allow more FTs.




Govt will allow more FT. many sporeans bot property in recent years n the backlash of losing elections due to property price drop is greater than pleasing the general public.

Actually, some ppl bought and sold and sitting on huge amt of cash.. and dun know what to do with them.. With so much liquidity in the mkt, some started with 1 house, sell , then bought 1 and now buying or bought 2nd/3rd one. 
 

And there are those act smart ones, sold their first house. Now renting or staying with family, and has no choice but to buy once they see a dip because rental is in cash while housing loan can be paid by cpf.. So they need to come back into the mkt before their cash runs out. 
 

But one thing for sure.. most if not all of the buyers know the risk.  Since 2009.. gurus has been predicting that the price will drop .. We also have a few gurus in mycarforum , saying that prices will reverse.. Yet, all these has not materialized.

agree, an old friend said price is going to fall and eventually sold off 5rm for 450K.  price went up o 550K and i lost 100K

You cannot say you lost 100k lah, unless you sold less than what you paid for.
 

2015 is when all the condos and BTOs are completed. That's when those that bought condo can sell.

sorry... dun get you. if 2015 all the condo and bto are completed, why can sell ? 
 

aniway, if the price drop its not going to be a sharp drop over a short period of time. If it really drops, it will continue to drop qtr by qtr for at least 3 yrs... that's how cycle works..
 

So you think you want to sell now and buy at drip,you need to be prepare buy 4 yrs later... then you may be able to catch the bottom or close to bottom. so make sure you sell what you are not staying... 
 

then again, if you are not stay... why sell? when you can get good rental now :| 
 

Those that are homeless... better buy now before the cash run out.. else you are may be homeless because of the 5% requirement.

Your math is excellent.
 

However, hindsight is always 20/20 vision.
 

What if 6 months later, the price is 350k ?

He say market will drop in 1 - 2 years time. 
 

I am saying that the chance of market dropping big time is higher in 2015 when all the condos are completed.
 

Anyway, don't whack me lah. I just bought a property a few months ago, I want the market to cheong big time !

Which new launch Condo is good for investment?
 

Considering
 

1. To rent after TOP or sell at profit in few years time

2. Location like near MRT or internation sch or biz park

3. Less than $ 900 psf

4. Price less than $850K

5. 2~3 bed rooms




Is V on Shenton acceptable for your investment? The site is on current UIC building, 5 Shenton way. 
 

According the CBRE sales person, this site is for mostly investor (meaning local don't stay, just rent out).  The Bay area and new finance district will be around there.
 

Mass market condo had hit record highs, so not much room to move.  Maybe you can take a serious look at it. Next Friday price adjustment.

Went to a few showflat and notice a different trend again
 

In the past, developers will always sell the worse unit or lower floor unit first so that they can raise price when selling the higher floor/better unit and to convince the earlier buyers that they are getting the best price and the later buyers they are getting the better units
 

Is getting the worse unit at a lower price than others considered a good buy?
 

NOW, it is the opposite. They are selling the better units first. Reason being that they can sell the lower unit at a lower price in future without getting complains from the earlier buyers. Anyone else notice this subtle difference? It seems that developers are not optimistic they can release in batches and sell future batches at higher price
 

What do u guys think?

I'm not a property guy but I did notice lots of property pamphlets in my mail boxes and distributed at mrt stn. Also, SMS advert too... Thus, I believe the supply is outnumbering the demand and if that's true, there is only one direction property prices can go in short term.

I dont understand....unless there is a major crisis if not why will prices drop too drastically? I know it will stabilise, correct by a bit but drastic drop? People who buy will not sell it for less than what they bought for.....unless they are in urgent need of money.....so even if there's over supply, why will ppl sell and make a loss?

yeah..property is sentiments game.
 

when sentiments is bad during 2001-2004,  property prices could be 2/3 of present prices and no many wants to buy.
 

but now, everyone wants to buy, simply because the sentiments have changed.

Developer has a timeline to sell all units now as opposed to last time where they can take their time to sell or rent out the units when it top....these and the ABSD are dampening the market but prices is still inching upwards with signs of stabilising only now......if market worsen, they can just remove the cooling measures to stabilise it.....
 

Nobody wants the property market to crash...except for those who dont own any properties....if nobody buys, govt and banks will lose an important revenue, owners will have to top up cash, declare bankrupt if over leveraged....it will be chaotic....of the 10 most richest ppl in sg, 7-8 are involved in properties or related biz...

Government prob just want a correction and not crash. that's why all the cooling measures are implemented. Prices are alt most stabalising and upside may be limited. IMO, as long as SG remains attractive to FT, the prices will not crash. gov can easily soak up the demand by loosening the tap to FT. the only time property will crash is when times are really bad (people cannot hold or is bleeding) and FT doesn't want to come.

Yup,  a dead cat rebounce. Those waiting on the sidelines rushed in to buy after URA index dropped marginally
 

It is not just flyers but there are more property advertisement and the frequency increase. Just take a look at sat papers. How many property ads are there? And those in the ad, the project launched for how long already and still selling? Not to mention those already TOP still got units left especially those high end market unit where there is a boom few years ago. Few years later, the same thing will happen when all the suburban units are completed

again this proves the point that it is nonsensical to think the FH (loyang) holds value better than LH 99(Pasir Ris).  pasir ris priced higher because they are near more amenities than loyang who is only near to industrial parks and prisons 
 

i don't think it is just the pasir ris beach that swung in its favor because there are quite a few developments in pasir ris not that near to beach.
 

anyway near to beach fetching premium is true....look at marine parade hdb flats.   without mrt station serving the estate, to be able to command such a price speaks volumes about the feel good factor of the beach.  but must look at the quailty of the beach also la, if not west coast beach and pasir ris beach condos would also command a premium liao.

Another reason would be that during a recession, most people would shy away from buying property as job security and minimizing expenses takes priority. So usually, only the rich with spare cash will jump in and pick up properties on the cheap during a recession. That's how they become richer.

actually this year there is so much of the greece and european crisis rearing its head but yet buyers are still gungho.  sometimes job security is not directly the cause but "perceived job security" is more likely.  i think compared to early 2000, people now tends to think jobs are rather secure whereas people during early 2000 tends to less inclined to think job is secure.

parc olympia is not near to the beach at all 




nah think he is referring to the pasir ris projects nearer to beach because i told him pasir ris project 900psf, which is significantly higher than parc olympia, although both are considered same area.

I guess for most people, the negative effects of the Greek/Euro crisis has not really cascade over to the region and Singapore yet. Instead, we're seeing the positives from this crisis in the form of a stronger SGD against GBP and EUR which makes it cheaper to go europe for holidays! Also, the quantitative easing by US has resulted in massive liquidity finding its way to the various safe havens with Singapore being one of them.
 

That's why to most people, jobs still seem secure.

i agree.  i mean the crisis aside, demand for housing being high now means more people are gungho.  so a lot of it is due to sentiment.  of course liquidity too. too much money in their bank, they feel gungho to buy another one for investment.

During the early 2009, went to see Double bay (in simei); the price for 3 bedroom was about $900K+. It was during the recession period so dun dare to buy. Din even consider the 2 room for investment.
 

Now the 3 bedroom ppl selling $1.4  [bigcry]

2k psf for shenton way considered damn cheap liao.




Yes you are spot on. Shenton area at $2K psf is below market. So it is worthwhile to look. So I refer to TS.
 

But $800 to 900psf on the fringe of Singapore borders are certainly expensive and over price.
 

Value investing is not just about lowest $ per sq ft.

Yup... people seems more "gung ho" this time. In my opinion, as long as one is not stretching their finances and is buying for own stay, then it should be fine. But I feel most are just jumping on the bandwagon and buying mainly shoebox units in the hope that prices would rise. If there is any downward adjustment, then I would think the shoebox units would be the hardest unit. I bought a house last year, so I'm not hoping for a crash cos that would affect most people but one or two corrections would be good to keep the growth in check.

My room in my previous house was facing the west sun. Even at night turn on the aircon still can feel the heat fromt the wall.
 

Its nice to look at sunset but not staying in an unit facing west sun. hahaha..
 

Even in HDB BTO price, the one facing West sun is cheaper than the next door unit (mirror image unit).

again this proves the point that it is nonsensical to think the FH (loyang) holds value better than LH 99(Pasir Ris).  pasir ris priced higher because they are near more amenities than loyang who is only near to industrial parks and prisons 

i don't think it is just the pasir ris beach that swung in its favor because there are quite a few developments in pasir ris not that near to beach.

anyway near to beach fetching premium is true....look at marine parade hdb flats.   without mrt station serving the estate, to be able to command such a price speaks volumes about the feel good factor of the beach.  but must look at the quailty of the beach also la, if not west coast beach and pasir ris beach condos would also command a premium liao.



 

Seriously... spoke to a few friends who used to stay at pasir ris..

Although , they enjoyed the peacefulness of the area.. *which i guess will soon be gone once all the condo tops* , the distance they need to travel to work / play is just too far. Esp if you have university going kids.. All the schools are in the far west , even smu in the central is an hr mrt/bus ride. :( 
 

To me LH99 pasir ris.. is no where near l99 bedok/tanah merah, and there are resale l99 condo that are selling so much cheaper.

no lei, he got those part time maid every weekend to clean up. think $10 per hour, since no cooking only clean toilet, wash bed sheets and throw away rubber.
 

think after howard shaw case, he is more firm to use the mickey mouse apartment as piak piak room since no authority can trace which hotel he check in 
 

may be ask him if can rent to me $30 per hour

Yes I ever stayed in pasir risk for a few years and the experience is exactly as what you just shared. But if you ask me to stay Loyang, I will even baulked more at it. 

I bought resale condo for the same reason you cited. There is no point buying new now because resale is a good 300 page cheap and means for a 1000 sf. Unit it is at least 300k more costly.

Pasir Ris is as far as punggol from City, in the past there was only PIE and now there r bartley flyover and KPE link to city and other parts of Sg, so its much better.

Woodland maybe worst if travel to n from city via CTE, imagine 1 expressway serving 7 or 8 big estates, thats jam all the way....

Yes, the food court may be more ex but if you know how to go to the staff canteen (public also allow to go) then the hawker food is cheaper than outside.
 

The rest of the restaurants are the same as shopping mall. The 7% GST is a good promo esp if you spend more. Example I wanna buy some chinese herbs for my father, when I go to T3 Eu Yan Sang, I can save ~$40 just on the GST alone; using the Changi reward card (above $500 spending) can get a $10 voucher. 
 

Ikea/ Giant/ Courts is a good place to spend few hours there when want to buy groceries or buy hot dog/ Ice cream (Ikea) with free parking.

despite my not so positive comment about loyang, i actually think your choice is good.
 

firstly for loyang area, i think having landed is good choice.  if you noticed, i am critising the choice of condo there.
 

secondly, i think your family can afford it and like you say, supplements your first home that is a terrace.  i am sure your family would not have shortage a car so transport is nto a big issue for you all.

NOt sure which condo is so strict on such rule, but most condo security I known just bo hiu. Even if so, just enter the premise from side gate

i think it all depends on the condo security guards.
 

one of my previous condo security guard, waves to anyone that drives in.  they seemed more like public relation officer rather than security guard.
 

another of my previous condo, started implementing signing in and out of facilities with the security guard quite on with the checking.

Got many top schools in Bukit Timah area mah...



 

Not really, the good schools are at Bukit Timah. Hillview is located at Upper Bt Timah just off Diary Farm Road. The nearest schools will be those at Bt Batok and one of two near Cashew Road.

How does the guard knows your unit has been leased out? You are still the legal owner of that condo unit mah....
 

Another way is to rent out the unit, but keep one access card with you and one car entry permit...then you can enter/leave freely.

Legally, u r still one of the owners there although it's being rented out. U mean the guards would every now n then check whoever is using the facilities there, going round asking for identity?

i know.  i know that area quite well.  Upper Bt Timah is more like wannabe/pretender to Bt Timah.  but having said that, i am no fan of Bt Timah as well.
 

traffic congestion etc.  it is ATAS because of schools and many rich people staying landed there.  but i would never buy a condo there due to the traffic and secondly even as a condo owner there, i don't feel same class as the many landed owners there

haha no la, i think you misinterpret what i said.
 

ok it goes back to my recent discussion with wife about a colleague of hers.  i think my wife suggested to her colleague to consider buying a condo near to her parents in law for convenience sake of taking care of babies.  her colleague say her husband only wants to buy freehold condo because they hold value better and there are no freehold condo near her parents in law place.
 

they say they target bukit timah area because of plethora of freehold condos but kind of cannot afford at this moment.  so my wife ask me why bt timah so expensive is it because freehold or is it because good location, convenient and plenty amenities.
 

i say people like her colleague who aims to stay bt timah is "bruising/swelling own face to act as fatty"
 

1) cannot afford and aim

2) got cheaper and more conveniently located condo near parents they forsake

3) bt timah traffic is bad because it is ATAS area many rich people drive and thereby transport no exactly top notch

4) bt timah atas because got good school but they are not aiming for bt timah school for their kid anyway

5) bt timah is prestigious neighbour due to many rich and important people living there and % wise a lot of landed that's what makes this area an enclave for the rich

6) so her colleague who is not rich, already is unrealistically aiming for Bt Timah condo

7) even if he can buy a condo there, he is nothing compared to the many landed home owners there
 

so that's why i say it is not high class merely because it is bt timah area.  some people like her colleague silly to think high-classness can be squeezed into form just by buying a condo there.

i love how some FH buyers contradict themselves:

1) why FH? cos forever mah and can hold value compared to L99

2) why wait? cos oversupply will cause the property prices to fall

i dont have that much patience

and although my condo got nice big plot of land (tennis court and big rectangular swimming pool)with only 180+ units, it is still very new and very well managed by jones lang, not the kind which will go enbloc.
 

forgot to mention earlier, unit is  facing northwest.

last done in market in July was $1940psf.
 

condos with tennis court and big swimming pool today have mostly 300++ units and are quite highly populated, even crowded.

mine is very exclusive and private and serene.

parking lots are abundant. can park lambo, ferrari, porsche, bentley, maserati, rolls, aston altogether also no extra charge.
 

supermarket across the street (3mins walk)

7eleven no need to cross street (2mins walk)

eateries, restaurants, cafes, bars (5mins walk)

MRT (8mins walk)
 

super easy to rent, i renewed my rental within 2 weeks with 1 single advert

super rare hidden gem in bona fide district 9 (not mount sophia/ emily area).
 

asking under $2mil where to find???

you takeover from me ai mai?

;)

Its nice to look at sunset but not staying in an unit facing west sun. hahaha..
 

Even in HDB BTO price, the one facing West sun is cheaper than the next door unit (mirror image unit).

You are exactly right.
 

When condos were cheap in 2002/3 and cars cheap in 2007 and 2009
 

not many people bought. I remember going to a show flat in 2002 and 
 

the staff were so happy to see you. Now they just ask for a cheque 
 

and tell you they already have many buyers at hand!

From wat i noe of geylang, not all lorongs are pros type. 
 

The odd ones,especially near to paya lebar r ok. Then the even ones all pros.

Not to worry. Geylang can't be relocated de!  
 

No other estate will "want" in at their backyard also. Nowadays people complain about workers dorm, old folks home, new BTO flats built near their houses... can't imagine if its a vice den instead!




Kranji? Rumor says it will be there n kranji isnt really an estate?

Chicken coops are all in the even lorongs mostly......6-16.....there are some in 20+ - 30+.....mobile ones dont say....anywhere can have.....
 

Vice activities there will be reduced....why? whats the main concern about visiting pros? Discretion, privacy, fear of getting caught, fear of meeting friends or relatives......if a coop are surrounded by brand new conscructions of new buildings, residential places, there will be increased complaints and police will patrol or spotchecks more often.....these will scare away would be customers......coop owners will have no choice but to relocate to other known vice areas where they will be left in peace....

was in between houses then, so geylang's rental was a viable choice. 
 

but from 2-20 now compared to 40 in the past, seem like reduce a lot liao. 
 

as for the kranji or changi rumor, i still find hard to believe. can't be suddenly all shift house. and i don't see anything build in kranji for them. unless govt is decentralising all the geylang pros to be in desker, joo chiat, etc.
 

sigh, guess theres really no replacement for displacement.

Reduction in numbers could mean a good thing! Thou less pros around but quality of services may have improved! Only the best are left servicing....yeah!  

Well, companies also reduced headcount as jobs are re-structured to be more efficent and cost effective mah!

There should  be a mrt there via future thomson line.
 

Don't invest in a place when all the infra is already up. 
 

Invest when the place seems to be developing malls, condos, offices, etc., never mind if the infra is crap at the moment.
 

Sooner or later, the infra will have to keep up with the development and that's when you reap the investment returns.

I dont know if there is a balestier mrt station via the Thomson line. Based on my limited knowledge, it's kinda hard to dig a tunnel that will intersect the North South line and the downtown line.......unless they link the thomson line to bishan mrt interchange and extend from there towards balestier....

Wow amazing..

Just saw one decent sized unit at Balestier. 

The Arte @ Thomson. 

Wah lau, damn freaking noisy lor!

The PIE was so loud, the owners cannot even open the balcony door!

Got to aircon 24/7. 

Not sure where this Dusun is, but the location really got to see. 

Too near the expressway, forget it. 

That side not near any mrt also, plus the roads there forever jammed.

The prelaunch hype and marketing is damn extensive. I stay near west side yet I received their postcard flyer.....really spend alot on the marketing.....but I guess the carrot they dangled could be priority for those who buy the resi unit to purchase the commercial unit....

Add in abt $500+ for development cost n u know $1800 is almost breakeven liao. If not for the current slowdown, they could probably flog it off for $2000+ psf.

Buyers only care about their pocket.
Mostly are waiting for winter sales at a great discounts.
 
Some developers had already pulled hand brake liao, known financing is real challenge for buyers.
There is no point bidding million into a piece of land when the margin is peanuts.
 
High quantum units mostly left on the shelves, with MM or 1mil below remain "loanable" to speculators bah.

if couple A & B own a private property and intend to buy another for investment, if only A buy it under her name, does she need to pay ABSD?

I'm not 100% sure but I believe yes must pay.
 

I heard what some people do is to remove their name from the first property but this one easier said than done and def involved legal costs and also the remaining party will have to pay the outgoing party's CPF used.

if couple A & B own a private property and intend to buy another for investment, if only A buy it under her name, does she need to pay ABSD?

 
Actually.. i disagree with wat other bros here say.. if couple a&b decide to buy ie have $$ to buy 2 .. Its juz a shifting ard of finances (no extra costs involved)... so.. Don't need to pay ABSD completely do-able.. 
 
ps... i know it a close friend who did that...

oh....interesting.
 
so simply buy it under one name will avoid ABSD, even though she may have another private property under her name?

yes.. tho cannot immediately ... must adjust to 1 name 1 property first. afterall.. its 'private' property. The issue here is only the loans.... which you need to work out and apportion... ie.. u pay for 1 property... she pay for the other property.. 
 
Think of it this way.. RICH father want to buy property with cold hard cash... put under son's name to avoid ABSD... fully do-able...  
 
For normal ppl like us.. really need to work out the bank loans portion...

so if she is able to justify that she can afford the pay for the two loans, both present and the impending one....is a good to GO?

bro.. think you misunderstanding me...  for eg.. 
 
property A ---  Loan A --- husband pay 
property B ---  Loan B --- wife pay
 
No need absd...  
 
ie... loan cannot be both under wife's name

provided husband and wife both are high earner and do not hit TDSR and able to take loan for property just by 1 name (single income)
 
if got cash to downpayment 2 properties and financial means to take loan separately ... any problem is no problem

Depending on the valuation of the shift.  Legal fees and stamp duty for that shift will cost some tens of thousands. 
For my case, i hv consulted lawyers, total cost to avoid ABSD is about $40k.
 
It also depends on whether the receiving party can take over the loan singlehandedly. 
Several other considerations.  For my case, no issue, just pay for legal work and transfer stamp.
 
So Confirm there are cost involved.
But can avoid paying AbSD.

Yes doable, but pay stamp duty on the part to buy out.So it is not like what you say, without cost.
 
Your example of rich father is slightly out of context and does not apply in the question we are discussing.
 
Therefore it is doable with some cost but still worthwhile savings on ABSD if buying bigger property.

  Challenging times ahead for shoebox landlords 
Landlords of shoebox apartments located outside the city centre will find it challenging to rent out their units once the influx of new homes enters the market next year, said experts quoted in the media. Most of the 53,900 new condo units set to hit the market over the next 30 months are small or shoebox apartments, or units measuring up to 506 sq ft.
 
Owners of such units for investment would not be as successful at getting the kind of rentals they want going forward, said Desmond Sim, Research Head at CBRE. There will be pressure on vacancies, as they will be facing competition from the broader market too. While there are no official figures on the number of shoebox units in the market, in September 2012 the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) estimated that there were around 2,400 completed units as at 2011, with the number climbing to 11,000 by the end of next year.
 
From 2009 to 2012, shoebox units featured heavily at newly launched projects including the 72-unit Suites@Guillemard in Lim Ah Woo Road, the 138-home Parc Imperial in Pasir Panjang Road and the 293-unit Alexis in Alexandra Road. Although they tend to have a higher psf price due to their small size, investors find the overall quantum more palatable, especially amid tightened financing, noted Chia Siew Chuin, Director of Research and Advisory at Colliers International.
 
Typically, rental yields of shoebox units range from three to four percent, up from the two to three percent yields for residential developments islandwide. However, experts warn investors looking to acquire shoebox apartments that rents for such units are expected to moderate in line with the flood of newly completed homes.

No one.
 
Whether $700k is spare or not , my answer is still the same.
$700k spare cash, most Singaporeans should have i think. No?

This I also agree. No offence to the guys who invested in Malaysia but that is definitely one place that moves goalposts like nobody's business so I wouldn't want to invest there but to each his own I suppose.
 

The other one to watch out for is those guys investing in land banks. Whilst I've heard of success stories, I've also heard my fair share of con investments so pls be careful!!

CM have to continue for sure. The underlying market demand is still very strong, despite many who are saying the market is dead, dying, direction down etc etc
 
without CM, the prices will shoot thru the roof once more
 
what the govt shld do is to also regulate overseas investments. instead of just saying that MAS will continue to monitor.
 
anyway, it is 2 years late already, the number of singaporeans buying all types of risky overseas properties in the last 2 yrs is no joke, esp when the shiit hits the fan in another few yrs time

i see the way that singaporeans snap up overseas properties, makes me  
 
i just hope that these guys are not using their 棺材 fund or children's education fund to buy.. otherwise they will prob be in a world of pain soon

Fully agreed on the overseas properties investments and as per my previous post, I preach caution. That said, how to regulate or monitor? In fact we can't stop Singaporeans from investing overseas cos it's their money right?
 

As for the CM, I also agree it has to stay but the one measure I feel should be removed is the ABSD for Singaporeans cos this serves no purpose anymore esp if the buyers have qualified under TDSR which should be the main measure.

one way i would suggest is to apply TDSR to overseas properties as well
 
While not possible to enforce 100%, they can do random checks and catch a few to make examples out of. it should then deter the marginal person to think twice before buying
 
another is for HDB to also random check and confiscate flats of those who bought overseas property while still under MOP (many that i know of). catch a few and the rest will also be wary liao

TDSR is oredi applicable for overseas properties if one take a sgp-loan to finance it. If take loan to buy in MY, the banks there oredi hv their own TDSR long b4 Sg implemented it.

hmm, most buyers i know take overseas loan even if the interest is 8% simply because they wanna avoid TDSR
 
MY banks have their TDSR? maybe just this year they are getting a little more strict, but last 2 yrs i can tell you that they will unofficially lend a singaporean 90% LTV. The mortgage banker also told me they do not take into account what loans you have in singapore. Just look at your salary can liao
 
outside of malaysia even worse. some countries can buy a property without having to secure a loan until TOP

It's the SSD. Seller Stamp Duty
 
those who think can flip here and there.. you will have to pay SSD
 
Basically. its another form of the HDB MOP period, if you want to avoid paying this SSD.  Need to hold on for 4 years...
 
http://iras.gov.sg/irasHome/page04.aspx?id=10212
 
On 13 January 2011, the Government announced the extension of the holding period for imposition of SSD on residential properties from 3 years to 4 years based on new rates. The new SSD rates will be imposed on residential properties which are acquired (or purchased) on or after 14 January 2011 and disposed of (or sold) within 4 years of acquisition, as follows :
 
Holding period of 1 year : 16% of price or market value, whichever is higher
Holding period of 2 years : 12% of price or market value, whichever is higher
Holding period of 3 years : 8% of price or market value, whichever is higher
Holding period of 4 years : 4% of price or market value, whichever is higher
 
 
Properties acquired before 20 Feb 2010 will not be subject to SSD.
 
 
Industrial properties also have SSD now.
 
On 11 Jan 2013, the Government announced that a seller's stamp duty (SSD) will be imposed on industrial properties (hereinafter known as "industrial SSD") which are bought or acquired on and after 12 Jan 2013 and sold or disposed of within three years. The amount of SSD payable shall be computed based on the following rates :
 
Holding period of 1 year : 15% of price or market value, whichever is higher
Holding period of 2 years : 10% of price or market value, whichever is higher
Holding period of 3 years : 5% of price or market value, whichever is higher

Yes this SSD another CM so no more flipping like roti prata haha!!
 

Also, last time I checked the purchase date is counted as date option is exercised. So for those non-completed properties, by the time TOP should be 2 to 3 yrs liao, so just have to hold on abit longer to avoid SSD.

but my client in Singapore managed to secured a loan that has a 700k annual installment..., with a declared annual income of 200k. Of course now cannot liao

On 11 Jan 2013, the Government announced that a seller's stamp duty (SSD) will be imposed on industrial properties (hereinafter known as "industrial SSD") which are bought or acquired on and after 12 Jan 2013 and sold or disposed of within three years. The amount of SSD payable shall be computed based on the following rates :
 
Holding period of 1 year : 15% of price or market value, whichever is higher
Holding period of 2 years : 10% of price or market value, whichever is higher
Holding period of 3 years : 5% of price or market value, whichever is higher
 
 
Industrial properties acquired before 12 Jan 2013 will not be subject to SSD.

yes so buy rent 3-4 years then sell simple

Whats wrong with staying in HDB under MoP period buy overseas property? 
 
The reason gahmen introduce mop is to avoid people making profit from their HDB and also to avoid price inflation 
 
When u buy overseas property, that doesnt give any right for the gahmen to interefere.

under the lease agreement one signs with HDB, already spelt out clearly that cannot buy another property (local or overseas) within the MOP period
 
so legally you cannot do it. As to whether it is right or wrong, fair or unfair, that's another matter.

Legally its wrong but they have no way to enforce it, if the person didnt show the title deed, no gahmen will know where u bought the overseas properties

You never know if they will know or not until it's too late. 
 
According to our gahment, public housing is heavily subsidized (market). So, if you can afford overseas property within 5 years of purchase, you must be rich. So, no need subsidies. Please return your flat.  
 
My interpretation is that, if after buying such public housing at overly inflated price, and you still can afford overseas or private property, you are rich enough. So, no need "market subsidies".

Really? U believe that no way PAP can prove if you bought an overseas property?
 
The only issue is if they want to prove or not.
 
I agree it is not enforceable, but if they take the effort to expose and whack 2 or 3 culprits, you can be sure at least 50% of those who planned to do it will ball shrink and decide otherwise
 
Good enough to save a lot of ppl from losing their pants in a few years time

Some overseas property are cheaper than HDB
 
 
And whats wrong with investing? Does that mean that a person stays in HDB need to return their flat to gahmen if he has 700k cash and shares?

it's a matter whether they want to check or not.
 

Still hard to trace especially if that person appears to be low profile in public

hard to trace doesnt mean impossible to trace
 
for the purpose of making an example, obviously they will not choose a low profile guy as the scapegoat right
 
As to what is the punishment, it is never disclosed. If you follow the lease agreement, i believe the govt has the right to confiscate your flat
 
it wouldnt be too far fetched, if you are cash rich to buy an overseas property, you probably will not be homeless too if the govt takes your flat back.

it's a matter whether they want to check or not.
 

 
yeah, PAP may look clueless on many obvious issues, but i wouldn't put it past them to dig up evidence of a HDB dweller buying an iskandar condo during one of the many property seminars conducted over the past few years
 
too many paper trail to pick up

If investing in JB consider rich, I dunno what to say liao
 
Unless u talking about 1 room HDB, otherwise living in 4 and 5 rooms flat considered as middle class in singapore and the price of it would have been able to get big semi D in other countries

huh? never said anything about ppl who invest in JB is rich
 
what i said was that while it is politically sensitive to confiscate flats, it is not inconceivable that HDB might confiscate a flat because the owner bought an overseas property.
 
simply because the owner should have no problems buying a resale after that

Don't get too confused with poor and rich and price difference between local and overseas. These are relative.
 
Yes, some living in HDB are super rich. But, if at time of flat application, they are just drawing an average salary, they are entitled to apply. Rules are clearly laid out.
 
However, if a person got rich suddenly after moving in due to whatever reasons, he is still entitled to live in. Nobody can chase him/her out.
 
Whatever things people may like to criticize our gahment, I think our gahment is fair as far as rules relating to public housing is concerned (though I fully disagree with the subsidies and foreign/PR ownership part). 5 years MOP is so basic and simple fulfillment. 
 
As far as public housing is concerned, you follow the rules HDB/gahment set. If you cannot follow these simple rules, buy a private property, and nobody can hold you back from buying an overseas property the next day.

Hmm buying resale also have MOP
 
 
And in fact that resale flat are still subsidized flat as u enjoy subsidized pub bills and other benefits.
 
 
Unless the person bought a condo then its not subsidized, but then again if seizing back the flat forcing the person to buy a private in sg does that mean that gahmen encourage people to leverage further? As u know that the private property price are way higher than resale HDB flat and overseas properties combined

When u can afford a 5 room or even the resale one, he would be a middle income. HDB is created to provide home for Singaporeans at an affordable price. There are two type of HDB buyers, those the lower income that bought or rent one room flat or those who stay in 5 room that have a car and enjoy travelling twice annually
 
However I do agree with u that u cant chase that person out if he get rich

as i have said, the penalty is not said out loud. HDB can confiscate, force you to sell your overseas property, fine you, etc etc
 
up to them to decide. i would think they will set out a harsh punishment, but not to the point that forces you to sleep on the streets lah
 
maybe lease you a rental 2 room HDB flat or something like that lah

Depending on the valuation of the shift.  Legal fees and stamp duty for that shift will cost some tens of thousands.
 
For my case, i hv consulted lawyers, total cost to avoid ABSD is about $40k.
 
It also depends on whether the receiving party can take over the loan singlehandedly. 
Several other considerations.  For my case, no issue, just pay for legal work and transfer stamp.
 
So Confirm there are cost involved.
But can avoid paying AbSD.
Yes doable, but pay stamp duty on the part to buy out.
So it is not like what you say, without cost.
 
Your example of rich father is slightly out of context and does not apply in the question we are discussing.
 
Therefore it is doable with some cost but still worthwhile savings on ABSD if buying bigger property.

Not worth if you consider the legal implications. N make sure your marriage damn steady sia.

CM have to continue for sure. The underlying market demand is still very strong, despite many who are saying the market is dead, dying, direction down etc etc
 
without CM, the prices will shoot thru the roof once more
 
what the govt shld do is to also regulate overseas investments. instead of just saying that MAS will continue to monitor.
 
anyway, it is 2 years late already, the number of singaporeans buying all types of risky overseas properties in the last 2 yrs is no joke, esp when the shiit hits the fan in another few yrs time
 
i see the way that singaporeans snap up overseas properties, makes me  
 
i just hope that these guys are not using their 棺材 fund or children's education fund to buy.. otherwise they will prob be in a world of pain soon

I wonder if the forummer ever wonder why the price shot up?
 
Any other commodities price increase?
 
Looking at the sheer number of properties in the pipeline.. Do u think they are engineering a soft landing or a hard landing?  
 
Will it to to their advantage if they want to crash the prices. The take-up rates are so poor now..why would they Not stop building but kept releasing the Land n build like no tomorrow? 
 
Do they know something which we don't?

very good questions
 
a simplistic answer without much thought given would be that the market is going down and those who buy land and build like there is no tomorrow are all small boys who are desperate for land
 
If u think harder, u'll realize the answer for yourself

Now now, a SIMPLISTIC answer would be if developers buy land, then price has to continue going up.When in history have developers without land ever stop buying land in any country
 
You tell me?
 
No land no build no business no company no developer
 
Simplistic indeed!  Wahah.
 
Land will always be acquired,  just like COEs.

It may be true. But rental will be hot in such locations.
Still can make money.
Because the nearby, not ideal, condos will also priced their psf at the benchmark. As a whole, the psf will only be increasing. Don't say recession. Generally it will go up to cater to the 7million population.
There is no other way that psf will stagnant or drop in land scare Singapore.

So now its 2015. 3 yrs since this thread began.

Guru, correct me if I'm wrong. 
Generally speaking, property prices now are at 2012 levels.
It is those that bought between 2008 and 2010 which have a small windfall.

Not guru, just someone who puts money where his mouth is.
In terms of prices, probably there. Give and take.
Those who bought between 2008 to 2010 should have sold 2013-2014 for easy sale and high price.
Today, even ifyou have paper profit, it is diminishing by the day.

Govt fair or not?  Average $1270 psf
 
This will teach us that utimately at the end of day, whatever property u "own" in SG, it still belongs to ah gong.  No such thing as freehold
 
 
https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/45mill-homeowners-affected-mrt-line-033217223--sector.html
 
According to media reports, the owners of six semi-detached houses and nine walk-up apartments that will make way for the upcoming Thomson-East Coast MRT Line (TEL) will receive a total of $45 million as compensation, or $1,270 psf on average.
 
 
The apartments are part of a shophouse complex at Tanjong Katong Road, while the six semi-Ds are located in Amber Road, Katong.
 
 
Although some owners have accepted the price as being fair, others are requesting for a bigger amount as it is below the area's prevailing market rate.
 
 
We can easily get $1,300 to $1,600, but they are offering us much less, said Cheng Quek Hin, 66, a retired contractor who owns one of the apartments.
 
 
Based on recent transactions, prices of landed homes in the vicinity range from $1,350 to $1,550 psf, while Amber Towers was collectively sold for $1,118 psf in 2011, noted JLLs research head Chua Yang Liang.
 
 
It would appear that the compensation for these owners is fair, at least on a land-value perspective, he said.
 
 
Under the Land Acquisition Act, property owners dissatisfied with the compensation can submit their appeal to the Singapore Land Authoritys (SLA) Appeals Board.
 
 
SLA is in the process of settling with other property owners affected by the TEL development, including the Laguna National Golf and Country Club which will lose over 190,000 sq ft of land.
 
 
Chua shared that the clubs compensation is expected to be lower on a psf basis as the land is cheaper than in the case of the residential properties.

Govt fair or not?  Average $1270 psf
 
This will teach us that utimately at the end of day, whatever property u "own" in SG, it still belongs to ah gong.  No such thing as freehold
 
 
https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/45mill-homeowners-affected-mrt-line-033217223--sector.html
 
According to media reports, the owners of six semi-detached houses and nine walk-up apartments that will make way for the upcoming Thomson-East Coast MRT Line (TEL) will receive a total of $45 million as compensation, or $1,270 psf on average.
 
 
The apartments are part of a shophouse complex at Tanjong Katong Road, while the six semi-Ds are located in Amber Road, Katong.
 
 
Although some owners have accepted the price as being fair, others are requesting for a bigger amount as it is below the area's prevailing market rate.
 
 
We can easily get $1,300 to $1,600, but they are offering us much less, said Cheng Quek Hin, 66, a retired contractor who owns one of the apartments.
 
 
Based on recent transactions, prices of landed homes in the vicinity range from $1,350 to $1,550 psf, while Amber Towers was collectively sold for $1,118 psf in 2011, noted JLLs research head Chua Yang Liang.
 
 
It would appear that the compensation for these owners is fair, at least on a land-value perspective, he said.
 
 
Under the Land Acquisition Act, property owners dissatisfied with the compensation can submit their appeal to the Singapore Land Authoritys (SLA) Appeals Board.
 
 
SLA is in the process of settling with other property owners affected by the TEL development, including the Laguna National Golf and Country Club which will lose over 190,000 sq ft of land.
 
 
Chua shared that the clubs compensation is expected to be lower on a psf basis as the land is cheaper than in the case of the residential properties.
 
 
Except for the few residential units along Meyer, Marine Parade and Tanjong Rhu, the rest are either institutional or industrial, he added.

They should have a ruling that SLA will only listen to "fair" appeals and not frivolous ones and SLA can also reduce the value of the govt award should SLA feel it is above market.
Definition of "fair" would be on comparison of similar nearby sales and if too long ago, a formula should be applied and also taking into consideration land taken for  roads/mrt vs redevelopment.
 
Not trying to penalize the owners but don't you think if the above is not in place that owners will always try their luck to appeal and hope for higher compensation as they have nothing to lose??

Obviously the owner meant that the land is worth higher before the government decided to repossess and made the 1270 psf offer....
 
How to sell for higher after the government has already exercised the eminent domain rights and already put the price as 1270 psf?

Redhill is definitely better. Way better than Potong Pasir. Redhill has good amenities and it is just 10 mins from town by MRT.

holy crap... now theyre talking abt ROE??? WTF where got pple invest that way one??? while technically correct, this just skews the standard yield calculations n makes retail investors get more confused
 
low yield means low yield, dun go n smoke pple by changing how prop yields n cap rates are calculated

 
No wonder i talk to so many "experts" about investing my money , and they say that 10% is very easy and almost guaranteed..........

Looking at your criteria, the best match (Met almost all your criteria) I can think of are those around Flora Drive - Palm Isles, Parc Olympia etc.
 
IMHO, Palm Isles is a better choice cause it is developed by F&N. Very good quality work; Good free shuttle bus to changi biz park. And also the chairman is the son/brother of 2 famous personalities 
 
As for Parc Olympia, the theme is new, the developer is also fairly new in developing residential projects. So, caveat emptor lah

Time flies....
Palm Isles and Parc Olympia look ready to collect keys.

	Developers face hefty extension charges over unsold units

SINGAPORE - Property developers may incur up to S$90 million in extension charges for unsold units in their condo projects from April to December 2015, followed by S$238 million in 2016 if the health of Singapore's real estate market does not improve.
This adds up to a staggering S$328 million that developers are expected to fork out in the worst-case scenario should they fail to sell any units by end-2016, according to calculations by property consultancy firm Cushman and Wakefield (C&W).
As at the end of the first quarter, developers had paid about S$119 million in extension fees for unsold units for condos completed from 2010 onwards.
Condos completed before that were mostly fully sold in the property market boom, C&W said.


Big welcome for d'Leedon residents

The huge jump in numbers from one year to the next is partly due to the way such Qualifying Certificate (QC) charges are calculated: at per annum rates of 8 per cent of the land purchase price for the first year, double that (16 per cent) for the second, and triple that (24 per cent) for the third/subsequent years of extension.
The amount is pro-rated according to how many units are unsold.
The huge jump is also due to more projects completed (ie received their temporary occupation permit) in 2014 compared to 2013.
Since "foreign" developers are required to sell their units within two years of completion, more would be incurring these charges in 2016, compared to 2015.
The definition of "foreign" includes developers with even just one foreign shareholder or director, which is why all listed companies are deemed "foreign".

The rules are aimed at preventing foreign developers from hoarding or speculating in residential land in Singapore.
"From the policy angle, the intention was to allow developers to build and sell, thus contributing to the housing supply and hopefully a reduction in prices," said KPMG Singapore principal tax consultant Leung Yew Kwong.
"Otherwise, developers might simply hold onto their unsold units and wait for prices to go up, or for the cooling measures to be dismantled."
Among the developers who could incur considerable QC charges these two years are CapitaLand, City Developments (CDL), Wheelock Properties, Wing Tai, Heeton Holdings, and foreign multinational conglomerate China Sonangol.
CapitaLand's QC-bearing projects include Urban Resort at Cairnhill Road (which will incur about S$2 million by end-2016); The Interlace at Depot Road (S$20 million by end-2016), and d'Leedon at Leedon Heights (S$13 million by end-2016).
CapitaLand stressed that this is only if it does not move any unsold units by then. Also, The Interlace and d'Leedon are among the largest condo projects here with 1,040 and 1,715 units respectively, hence their inevitable bigger number of unsold units.
"As the developments are largely sold, the estimated extension charges for the first year, if payable, are not substantial and constitute only a small fraction or less than 2 per cent of the selling price of the unsold units, and therefore have limited impact on our overall financials," it said.
Nouvel 18, a luxury project along Anderson Road, a 50-50 joint venture between CDL and Wing Tai, has not been launched yet and so has no sold units.

It has until November 2016 to sell the units. In the worst-case scenario where all the units remain unsold, the JV will have to pay up to S$38 million in extension premiums.
This amount is pro-rated based on the proportion of unsold units in the project.
Wing Tai has another upscale project nearby, Le Nouvel Ardmore, which remains 91 per cent unsold a year after completion. It will incur about S$15 million in charges if sales continue to be dismal.
Also in the vicinity is Wheelock's Ardmore 3. The 96 per cent unsold translates to about S$14 million in QC charges by end-2016 if units remain unsold.
As for China Sonangol's TwentyOne Angullia Park, 83 per cent was unsold at last count, which means it may incur up to S$19 million in extension fees by end-2016.
For the big listed developers, analysts say these charges, while seemingly hefty, make up a minuscule percentage of their market cap and book values and are thus unlikely to make a dent on their financials.
Rather, it is the smaller developers such as Heeton that may face a more punishing reality. The developer, about S$160 million in size, has potential QC charges running up to about S$19 million by end-2016 in the worst-case scenario.
This is for projects such as iLiv@Grange (built with Soilbuild), Lincoln Suites (built with Koh Brothers, Lian Beng and KSH) and The Boutiq.
Just five months away from its two-year deadline in October 2015, Heeton has recently engaged C&W to conduct an expressions of interest exercise to find an en bloc buyer for all 30 units in iLiv@Grange.
It received three bids attached with different conditions, and the developer is reviewing its strategy going forward. The project in the plush Grange Road area has not sold a single unit since it was completed in October 2013.
C&W research director Christine Li thinks that there is little hope of projects moving by themselves, judging from how some projects here have not sold anything at all in the last two years.
"On the other hand, developers who have been proactive in marketing either individual units or bulk purchases of whole projects have achieved better results," she said.
As most of the unsold units facing QC charges are in the core central region, Ms Li believes that developers should consider bulk sales or project relaunches, as there is still interest in the high-end segment from both institutional and retail investors.
There are not many other options a developer hoping to avoid QC charges has left.
Already, the possibility of converting homes to serviced apartments to wait out the slow market has been ruled out, after the Singapore Land Authority said such developers would not be absolved from the two-year deadline and extension charges.
Lee Liat Yeang, real estate lawyer at Rodyk & Davidson, said that developers need to do the math.
"If the QC company has a few units left, it might wish to consider selling the units off at a bargain discount. After all, such units will contribute to profits and it makes sense to just clear them and move on."
The two other options are to go the "Hiap Hoe route" (ie selling units to the parent firm) or the "SC Global route" (ie delisting).
"The QC company's holding company might wish to set up an investment company to buy the leftover units, but such purchases will attract buyer's stamp duty and additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) accordingly.
The controlling individual shareholders who are Singaporeans or permanent residents can also buy at lower ABSD rates (compared to foreigners)," Mr Lee said.
Developers also need to weigh other costs, such as whether QC charges in their first year will exceed the stamp duties they have to pay, bearing in mind that if the units remain unsold a year later, the QC charges will double and there is no way of knowing how the property market will fare then, said Mr Leung from KPMG.
He also thinks that developers' method of delisting or changing their ownership to Singaporean just to escape QC charges defeats the policy's original intention, which was to add to housing supply and correct prices.

But if u really explore those projects that likely hit penalty are those in the ultra luxury condos in D10/prestigous areas. These condos are cost simply more than 2m or psf at least $2000. So even if price is revised for these condos, not many local still can afford. It is those foreign investor that will act. Therefore, those who can afford and are looking for high end condos at these areas can wait further, hoping for price revision. However, for those looking for the middle range or suburban condos, waiting will likely left with not so good units. Like lower floor, west sun, blocked facing, poor facing etc...
Though price maybe lower, but one has to compromise with all these factors. It is ok if is only for investment and not own stay. Unless one don't mind condos that are TOP much later like 2019 onwards.

Fast east - 100% sg owned and not listed not affected. 
 
CDL - local company but listed therefore affected.

Certain people take maximum bet on the property market. 
 
Far East is one developer who does so. 
 
The developers who delist or sell their developed properties to a subsidiary or related company to avoid the QC is another. 
 
Today's news there is another individual who scammed 60 million with a property based ponzi scheme. 
 
I think the current CMs do well to weed out or restrict such speculative or hoarder groups.

IMO Far East doesn't take bets in the market, they seem to have a good entry and exit strategy. The land they acquire are pretty cheap on value. I recall The Shore was built on the old Rose Garden which was sold at 718 psf ppr, the area where they built the overpriced silversea was even lower below 500 psf ppr.

Really depends on how this is viewed. Take for example Henry Park Apartments acquired some time back for over 1000psf. They have just left it empty and sitting there. If market continues to languish for years, not too sure if they have to start paying the tax on vacant land that was announced in the budget a couple of years back.
 
Of course they are huge and their bets can easily be framed as investment strategy based on some distorted form of market manipulation. And due to the dogma of money makes money, I have little doubts that they will continue to win most of their bets. 
 
Just my two cents.
 
 

IMO Far East doesn't take bets in the market, they seem to have a good entry and exit strategy. The land they acquire are pretty cheap on value. I recall The Shore was built on the old Rose Garden which was sold at 718 psf ppr, the area where they built the overpriced silversea was even lower below 500 psf ppr.

The group definitely has certain long term strategies, for instance they have apartment blocks around pasir panjang which is solely for lease only, odd that wasn't redeveloped as they had developed another project nearby. Though the Henry Park acquisition does seem overpriced, be interesting to know what they were planning when they acquired that.
 
It interesting how they converted Rose Garden to a private leasehold agreement, that's the first I've heard in Sgp I wonder if any such arrangements took place before.
 
It looks they are doing some legacy building as well, I doubt the current generation will see thru half of the lease of Rose Garden lol
 
my 2 cents also

It is definitely wonderful if you are in their shoes.
 
But there are lots of unhappy souls that classify their strategies as gaming the system and perpetuating and amplifying the rich poor divide as well.

Hrmm when you say poor souls is it in reference to HDB up-graders looking to acquire a condo and find themselves priced out of the market or the poorest in our society which live day to day? I can see how the former might be impacted by property developer tactics but not the latter, and if it is the former I also a varied opinion on that as well

Definitely not the latter groups, whom HDBs and MND have targeted specifically to help own homes.
 
It's mainly those who from the get go can't buy HDB. For example, singles can't buy till 35. At 35, theirs or the household income might exceed HDB eligibility. Anything that sounds like market manipulation to prop up the price irritates them greatly, but anything that tells them no demand and huge supply for them to choose excites them.
 
This explains partly some of the cooling measures including taxing on vacant land and units.
 
HDB upgraders have a myriad of options provided their loans are cleared or very manageable. 
 
But it's just my experience and social circle.

That's a fair point heh I totally forgot about this group. Unfortunately our government policies are crafted in a manner which excludes this group (i.e under 35 and single). They would of course want to focus on marriage couples and racial balances etc which is in the center of their policies. But the cooling measures does level the playing field which benefits everyone.
 
Unless policies change this group will just have to be subjected to market forces, and if a "crash" did happen loans would become harder to access so one would need a good war chest to take advantage of the situation. Haizz vicious circle  .

But if you allow those who exceed income ceiling to buy HDB... there will be another camp from the lower income bracket (not in the same income bracket as these "unfortunate" ones in the higher income bracket) who will kpkb as there will more competition in the subsidised housing category.
 
At the end of the day, the policy makers will have to draw the line somewhere. Otherwise, there will be always be the argument that A is near to B and B is near to C, hence A is near to C. Then rinse and repeat, A is near to Z.
 
The proof is in the pudding they say, ask the "unfortunates" in the higher income bracket if they would trade places with the "lucky" who qualify for the housing subsidy?

if the govt build enough HDB for the "people" this would not be the case liao
as a citizen ... why he/she is banned from buying HDB just because he/she earn more
earning more and don't want to buy $1M mickey mouse condo is wrong meh
isn't the govt want the people to spend within their means?
the only reason is to push people to buy private property to hold the market
we are not talking about one can buy as many hdb as he want like whack all units and deprieve the opportunity of others
1 family (husband+wife or 1 single) can only entilte to buy 1 hdb .... not fair meh?
if above certain income level can limit to buy 4-5 rooms what ... why must banned totally ...
the excuse of household earning $10K to buy private because they deprieve the chances of other is lame la
$10k is the new poor hor ... low middle class nia
the reason is if no one buy private with the insane pricing ... the private property will collapse and shit hits the fan

Sabian and wtKnow both hv good points but i still sway towards allowing Singaporeans to buy new HDBs regardless of income bracket as long as they buy and live in it.......
 
Becos otherwise, its as good as saying that if your income bracket is higher, you cannot choose to go to govt hospital.  You need to pay an admission to or buy a right from someone who has a lower income bracket.  What f**k logic is that?
 
If i have money, i choose not to buy Mercy, i buy Hyundai, cannot meh??!!?.
I chiose to ride bike , cannot meh?!!?  
 
Then i go eat hawker center also cannot already.....wah lao

I understand where Throttle2 and Wt_know are coming from.
 
But housing happen to be categorised as public goods and hence are distributed accordingly. And the govt has deemed that if you exceed a certain income threshold, you are deemed to be able to fend for yourself.
 
The other genie in the bottle is why can't an umarried person buy their own flat brand new without having to meet the age criteria?

I dont like the discrimination of singles . 
 
Anyway, if I looked into the matter further, I felt the g0v is just trying to force 2 headcount into 1 apartment. e.g. married or 2 single over 35 or a single + a child. In a way , they are forecasting the demand. however, they forgot abt the FT / PR / new happy citizen etc thats why there was a gap.
If every yr we have 30k new citizen ... thats ave 15K new apartments .
 
kind of OT here.

Singles must meet age criteria becos the priority must be to a family nucleus. So they didnt say cannot buy, just must reach 35 at least. Becos social studies show that if by 35 still single, chances are high that will stay single.  Bottomline, they allow.
 
Makes good sense and logic, bro.

Discrimination is too strong a word, lah.....At least the conditions can quite easily be met.
 
But denying a Singaporean his right to buy a brand new HDB simply becos his income is above a (low) bracket , thats awful.

DK is the best option for live in condo + investment (immediate return for rental), isn't it?
or the agent said can turn the studio to Big Master with walk-in wardrobe/etc and Master BR become Junior Master ... LOL

There is an underpass link to Bartley MRT on the side of the road where Bartley Resi and B@B are located.
I think it is in between the Ramakrishna Mission and Bartley Christian Church.
 
I not pantang. I went to view Bartley Resi, cannot tahan the inefficient layout (the space taken up by the door swing of the bomb shelter aka maid's room and the single bed only bedrooms bothered me a lot).
 
Agent told me to wait for Ridge as they have taken in all the feedback from potential buyers who viewed B Resi and intend to rectify it in B Ridge.
 
At that time, prices were still creeping up and I told him it was unlikely that my budget will be able to accommodate.
 
Then TDSR came along...
 
The cons of B Ridge is it supposedly near the Sanctuary. The niches will move to Mandai but a newer modern building will house the funeral parlour.
 
Another con is that is on lower ground while B Resi is on higher ground and will have a better view and the blocks facing outside have unblocked views.
 
So eyes wide open when buying. Anyhow, the B Resi is fully sold and B Ridge is 90+% sold with only Dual Key units left and other big unit types.
 
B@B landscaping is supposedly nice according to the showroom model. (Say again: Showroom model! Then UOL is not an inexperienced developer)
 
Main issue I have with B@B is 70% are smaller units (2 bedder or smaller) are "likely" to be tenanted out.

what's the ranking in terms of 1,2,3

 
B Res dual key layout is good, faces Pool IIRC and good size but it wil be costly as you need to buy sub-sale.
 
B Ridge 4 room and dual key still available from developer so you may be able to press the price down and who knows developer may bite.
 
Botanique like what Sabian says will likely have a lot of tenants due to the plentiful smaller units and IIRC they also don't have much choices for bigger units.

i believe all the 3 B probably have a lot of tenanted unit because of near to MRT and also within city fringe
 
by the way, do you guys think 800 units in a project is ok (in today standard) or sibei pack?

Maybe I old school but sounds pack to me.
That said Sims Urban has 1k+ units so maybe that's the new norm these days.
 
Guess you have to see the overall plot size and like in the case of Botanique they do have a 1 for 1 car park lot IIRC but that's not the situation at Sims Urban. Then again a 85 to 90% car park ratio is normally adequate esp if you don't require a 2nd lot.

thanks sabian ...
if i'm only interested in big units ...
ie: 4room or dual key units
 
B. Ridge
B. Residences
Botanique
 
what's the ranking in terms of 1,2,3

 
I am biased cos I am vested in Ridge. I am equally split between B Resi and Botanique for the following reasons.
 
B Resi likes:
Units have good frontage view, whether they face the landed in How Sun estate or Bartley Rd. 
 
The are located on high ground. For those who care about Fenghsui.
 
Much nearer to the MRT than B@B unless your B Resi unit is located at the border with B@B. Makes a hell lot of difference when you are making your way to the MRT in inclement or scorching weather.
 
B Resi dislikes:
Internal layout: I am paying 1.2k +psf for the bomb shelter door to swing around???
 
I don't even want to pay cash for a J seat on SQ for my own butt lor...and the bedrooms cannot accommodate more than a single bed. A super single is also out. Deal breaker for me.
 
Internal bomb shelter
 
B@B likes:
Showroom model indicates that the landscaping will be nice.
 
The dual key unit with its separate entrances that you posted earlier also caught my eye when I went to view. For the usage that you proposed, it is perfect for every stage of a person's life cycle.
 
Layout is more efficient.
 
As it fronts both Bartley and Upp Paya Lebar, you will find it convenient to go to Kensington for grocery in future.
 
B@B dislikes:
For the same reason as above, traffic noise may be an issue unless you opt for a unit facing the facilities or a unit a distance away from both roads.
 
It is also further than B Resi to the MRT. You need to walk the length of B Resi along Bartley Rd to get to the MRT.
 
High proportion of small units. Makes no difference if you are buying purely for renting and flipping though.
 
My boxes to tick were:
1. Bedroom size must not be restricted to single bed.
2. No internal bomb shelter
3. Near (250m) a well located MRT (for clarity: Pasir Ris is poorly located MRT, it's at the end of the line FFS! Dhoby Ghaut is the best located MRT to me. Ease of switching to another line is my yardstick. The other well located MRT is Bartley.)
4. Trustworthy developer
5. No west sun
6. Below 1300psf (the figure at which I am comfortable to enslave myself to so may not be applicable to you)
7. Above 10th floor (Those who stay above you can look into your unit so staying on a higher floor helps)
8. Decent landscaping (why else would you pay for a gated compound if the landscaping is not important)
9. Underground car park (I cannot fathom why one would pay so much and accept a MSCP. The Shore comes to mind)
10. Near a good school (it helps with the exit plan)
11. Joint area for dining and living (Cognizant of the fact that any unit I buy is going to small with my budget so a joint dining/ living gives me flexibility for free play)
12. Development must have more than 300 units. (Car park space are easier to find when people visit you for CNY/ birthdays and in a larger development, kids find more friends easily, I grew up in a 200 units condo and it was really fun during weekends or after school.)
 
If you are interested in DK/ 4 BR units, given that prices are not going anywhere in a hurry. B Resi is going to TOP in July or Aug. B Ridge is going to TOP in a year. 
 
You can view the actual finished product for yourself rather than have a "supplies" (surprise) when the actual product looks significantly different from the con job artist illustration like Pasir Ris One (and like to the only One), Centrale8, Trivelis and The Peak Aristo.

actually, how far is the Santuary from B. Ridge ... > 500meters?
for funeral service, i wonder the traffic probably travel via Aljunied or Bartley road (will pass thru B.Ridge)
 
The cons of B Ridge is it supposedly near the Sanctuary. The niches will move to Mandai but a newer modern building will house the funeral parlour.

Read the earlier topic on single 35 then can get HDB. I personally feel that this policy is warp. Nothing to do with me, but I see my friends, one of them want to get a house and move out but stuck because earn not enough to buy a private, cannot buy because only age 30. Another one, met a girl want to settle down, but the girl got private property ready in 2020.
 
Let's take a look at their situation.
 
Situation 1 - He has a roof over his head. That is with his parents. Monthly, making a salary of $3.6k with over 70k in CPF. Want to move out to stay on his own, but stuck because cash on hand not enough to cover downpayment. Want to buy private, need to top by $50k cash or more. Loan come, one month repayment $1.5k. That only get him a small one bedroom. Look at HDB, HDB tells him sorry, you are below 35. Both way stuck. Resign to fate to stay with parents.
 
Situation 2 - This person earns $4k a month. Age 30 also. Met this girl and want to settle down. This girl bought a private property before the start of the relationship. House only come in 2019. To wait until 2019 then move in, means there are 4 years more to go. By then, he will be 34. He knows he has the financial power to buy 1 bedroom condo, but that also means his finances will be drained and cannot have family expansion due to the limited size. Looking at 2 bedroom condo, cheapest also TOP in 2020. Which doesn't make any sense to him. He turned to HDB, and HDB tells him, since your fiancée has a private property, you can appeal to ask HDB give you a flat. But! your fiancée has to relinquish her condo. He think about it, that condo DP around 250k, which means they have to lose quite a lot of money.  Now think about renting, means they have to dump in 2k to 2.5k every month, not inclusive of utilities, until the day the private properties is ready. On top of that, they need to finance the private properties 2k a month cash. They are earning around 11k gross a month but they are stuck.
 
Is government policy make citizen stuck? I would say no, citizen can choose to relinquish their property. But sometimes, be compassionate to people who genuinely want to start a family or have life of their own. Not everything should go by "by right". The question here is, have a house first, f and have kids, or f first, have kids then find a house? Reasonable argument should of course be, have house first. But I see the policy government is making is, if you are middle class, you have to help yourself.

Not a problem. Can rent whole HDBs (1800 onwards) or rent a one bedder condo (2000 onwards). Room rental even lower. Stay with parents also not a bad idea for the moment. 
 
Wait to be eligible for other options. 
 
Relationships also hard to say how will turn out.

Strong sales at High Park Residences
The 99-year leasehold project is next to Thanggam LRT station and a short distance from Seletar Mall. 
 
Interest was strong on the first weekend of sales for High Park Residences in Sengkang, with nearly 1,100 units snapped up out of a total of 1,390 units.
 
That translates to 78 per cent of units sold, the joint venture developers said in a statement.
 
The new project, which includes nine commercial units, has seen all of its studio, "one plus study", shop and bungalow units snapped up by buyers.
 
The 99-year leasehold project is next to Thanggam LRT station and a short distance from Seletar Mall.
 
Mr Chng Chee Beow, executive director of CEL Development, said that the project attracted a diverse range of buyers from all over Singapore owing to the wide range of units, 118 recreational facilities, and free lifestyle classes on offer.
 
CEL Development is developing High Park with Unique Residence, a joint venture with Heeton Homes and Kim Seng Heng Realty.
 
"We are indeed very encouraged by the overwhelming response." said Mr Chng.
 
The project is set for completion in 2020. The show suite for High Park Residences is open daily from 11am to 7pm in Fernvale Road.

Leedon Residence posts strong sales after TOP
Jul 31, 2015
http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/property-management-news/2015/7/103137/leedon-residence-posts-strong-sales-after-top
 
 
Leedon Residence, a 381-unit luxury condominium project by GuocoLand Singapore, has reported an increase in enquiries and sales after achieving its Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) on 15 June.
 
The project has sold 24 units worth over $110 million in the last six weeks. Caveats lodged with the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) reveal that a total of 181 units have so far been sold at the project, or 80 percent of all units being marketed.
 
Of these, the projects three- and four-bedroom units ranging from 2,100 sq ft to 2,600 sq ft attracted the most interest, with 70 percent being Singaporean buyers.
 
After the property obtained its TOP, prospective buyers have also been able to examine the quality of the finishes and construction up close, experience the peaceful and private ambience of the property first-hand, as well as select the exact unit best suited to their needs, a statement said.
 
GuocoLand also attributed the recent uptake to the projects prime location, rare freehold status and superior design quality.
 
Spread over 5ha of land, Leedon Residence comprises two- to five-bedroom apartments, penthouses and garden homes ranging from around 1,000 sq ft to 8,000 sq ft.
 
Facilities offered include a gym, clubhouse, tennis courts, an Olympic-sized swimming pool and a separate resort pool. The development also comes with its own concierge service.
 
Surrounded by exclusive Good Class Bungalow Areas (GCBAs) such as Leedon, Cornwall, Belmont and Holland Park, the project is close to popular shopping and entertainment enclaves such as Dempsey Hill, Holland Village, the Singapore Botanic Gardens  a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and Orchard Road.
 
Leedon Residence is also just minutes from established schools such as Nanyang Primary School, Raffles Girls Primary School, National Junior College, Hwa Chong Institution and Saint Margarets Secondary School.
 
Moreover, it enjoys good connectivity to other parts of Singapore via Farrer Road MRT and major expressways such as the Pan Island Expressway (PIE) and Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE).
 
Commenting, Cheng Hsing Yao, Managing Director at GuocoLand Singapore, said: The recent surge of viewings and purchases at Leedon Residence is quite exceptional. At the same time, we are not totally surprised, because it is consistent with our experience with Goodwood Residence, which similarly experienced a surge in purchases after TOP.
 
Astute buyers can recognise quality and great value, and these become much more evident once the project is completed. They will thus commit to the purchase, because the earlier they do so, the better they are at getting the unit that best meet their needs, he added.

Oh, I feel they are good projects in today's market. Big land plot, in good central locations. $psf is lower than some new projects in worse off locations. But generous sized units mean the price quantum is over $2 million, hence the 'constipation'.

5 Reasons Why It’s Still a Terrible Time to Buy Singapore Property

5 Reasons Why It’sStill a Terrible Time to Buy Singapore Property
By Gerald Tay (guest contributor)
 
Tempted to buy a property due to the falling prices? Think again. In this article I will go through five reasons why I think it’s still a terrible time to buy Singapore property.
 
1. Property prices are still high for mass market homes
 
Since Q1 2009, prices in the Core Central Region (CCR) have risen 30 percent, 42 percent in the Rest of Central Region (RCR), and 60 percent in the Outside Central Region (OCR).
 
Since the peak in Q3 2013, prices of mass market homes have fallen a measly 5.5 percent. Properties in the OCR are still overpriced. Mass-market home prices haven’t dropped as much as those for luxury housing. Rental incomes are falling and vacancy rates are rising. A huge oversupply is looming on the horizon.
 
The bottom is still far from sight even though vested players claim it will happen in the next three to six months. While new home sales have dropped significantly, prices have stayed relatively high due to developers’ holding power.
 
There is still room for a further decline of property prices in the OCR. Investment opportunities will arise over the next couple of years when prices decline further.
 
My last purchase of a Singapore residential property was in mid-2012 before the policies came in. I won’t be re-entering the Singapore residential market until I see a further decline in prices. Prices need to drop by about 20 to 30 percent to make residential investments attractive again, not a measly 5.5 percent!
 
2. Interest rates are low but rising
 
Property prices rose as interest rates fell, and property prices will fall if interest rates rise with a weakened economy.
 
The way to win the game is to have cash on hand to buy at a low price when others cannot borrow very much because of high interest rates and the constraint of the debt servicing ratio. Then you get a low price, and you get capital appreciation caused by future interest rate declines. To buy an expensive property or believe in the fallacy of “affordable” property at a time of low (and rising) interest rates and high prices is a mistake.
 
It is far better to pay a low price with high interest rates than a high price with low interest rates, even if the mortgage payment is the same either way.
 
3. Government property curbs are here to stay
 
Many are betting on a removal of the cooling measures. I don’t see the government removing property curbs for the next two years. With interest rates on the way up, there will be pressure. The policy is working, there is no reason whatsoever for the government to relax it.
 
When stringent property curbs are here to stay, this only means property prices are still high.
 
4. Buyers are still biting the marketers’ bait
 
The problem with buyers who act like lemmings is that they become obvious targets for clever marketers. In today’s property market, how does a seller of real estate use human weaknesses to sell and profit?
 
Here’s a case study from the latest property launch near Seletar:
 
The Solution – Sell, market and lure “desperate” buyers with under $1,000 per-square-foot on average condominium units to beat the TDSR (Total Debt Servicing Ratio).
 
The Outcome – 1,110 lemmings rushed to snap up smaller units with empty cheques and balloting. 78% of project was sold within a weekend.
 
The Profits – 1,400 small unit apartments are cramped into every space possible.
 
This new successful sales model will soon be copied by other developers. As long as foolish buyers keep biting, sellers will continue to sell to them. Watching others get rich during boom times while you don’t is terrible enough. Lemmings want it now and that’s why they are prime targets today.
 
5. We may have an even greater financial crisis coming
 
Look for falling oil prices and another scare in China to spook the speculators, followed by a series of growing defaults like in 2008, but worse. They’re also kidding themselves if they think they can stop everybody from selling their stocks (look at China).
 
And expect the global crash that follows to be even more brutal thanks to all the financial manipulation in the system.But even beyond a global stock bubble, housing bubble, fracking bubble, and pension problems, there are signs of economic destruction across the world.
 
The air has been let out of China’s stock market. Commodity prices are down across the board to the detriment of the world’s emerging markets.Long-term interest rates are rising despite global efforts to suppress them with continued stimulus.Europe is enlarging the black hole of Greece by funnelling even more money into it. The euro zone as a whole has an unemployment rate over 10%. Japan is caught in a downward demographic spiral.
 
Chaos is erupting. And despite efforts to stop the global economic system from melting down, free market forces are finally starting to show governments and central banks who’s in charge. That’s the simple, bitter truth of it.
 
Inaction for now is the best action for savvy buyers and investors.Many are tuned in to the devastating market forces ahead. Those who are listening will be the best prepared. Those who have been patiently waiting on the side-lines and preparing themselves to take advantage of the coming crisis will be best rewarded.
 
For the buyers of today, I wish them luck.
 
A different take from the usual "Analysts" who always says now is the best time to buy...

There are also 2009 TOP (new) landed properties around.

 
Oh, I feel they are good projects in today's market. Big land plot, in good central locations. $psf is lower than some new projects in worse off locations. But generous sized units mean the price quantum is over $2 million, hence the 'constipation'. 

Also many/most development copy each other's concept although market already flooded with the same concept. 

Great article especially Point 5.

I believe those being launched are not very conducive for profits at the moment with the competition from similar others. Can be more practical to collectively buy land and develop instead.

Haha just my honest opinion being in the industry. I just invested an overseas property last year in london, but the quantum abit high. You may consider property in Phnom Penh Cambodia. I find it more attractive as compared to london. We occasionally conduct seminar on The Peak which is developed by Singapore developer Oxley Holdings. Their first launch over there was The Bridge which is launch last year and now 95% sold left the SOHO units.
 
As for local projects one of the top selling one is Botanique at Bartley. Majority of the others the prices are abit.. =\

Here is the largest upcoming residential project that buyers need to watch out for
 
Principal Garden will boast almost 700 units.
 
Developers are unlikely to launch large residential projects in September, but analysts are already on the lookout for a 660-unit condominium that is expected to be launched in late October.
 
A report by RHB highlighted that Principal Garden, a project by UOL located in Prince Charles Crescent, would be the most prominent upcoming project in coming months.
 
Although there is no indicative pricing issued by the developer, RHB Research believes that the UOL Group should be pricing the units at SGD1,500psf range.
 
This is in consideration that the land bided by the developer is around 15% lower than its adjacent land--on which The Crest by Wing Tai is being built--which sold at an average price of SGD1,698psf.

1500 to 1600 PSF for small units to medium size (below 900 sqft) sure sold out.
 
Large units might stay on for a while.
 
But this is like public housing to T2 with 700 units.

Actually, to be fair , to consider public housing or not , doesnt just depend on number of units.
It depends on the size of the whole estate.  If truly well spaced out and not densed, then it may be acceptable.  And also most importantly, the neighboring black cannot be a HDB! 
 
Imagine those condos at Dakota. Draw curtains in the morning and stare into a block of HDB flats barely twenty meters away.  What a joke for private housing!

http://sbr.com.sg/residential-property/in-focus/all-not-lost-developer-stocks-even-home-prices-crash-analysts 
All is not lost for developer stocks even as home prices crash: analysts
 
Share prices could rally soon.
 
A gloomy home price outlook is always a bad sign of things to come for developer stocks, but analysts say they have a reason to be optimistic.
 
Although home prices are often used as the key indicator for developer stocks, Maybank Kim Eng analysts argue that an improvement in sales volume could cause shares to rally even while property prices are falling.
 
We believe developer stocks can still rally despite the dire home price outlook over the next few years. In fact, this occurred in 15 out of the 31 quarters of home price contraction since 4Q97, said the report.
 
For instance, Maybank Kim Eng said that City Developments Limited (CDL) managed to buck a past downturn by increasing its sales. In the fourth quarter of 2001, CDL's share price jumped by 44.7%, even as home prices fell by a significant 4.3%.
 
CDLs share price rally was driven by a 43% surge in home sales volume and a series of off-budget measures introduced by the government to reverse cooling measures implemented over the years, Maybank Kim Eng said.
 
They added that home sales volume is headed for a rebound soon due to a potential lifting of cooling measures next year. This could provide a whiff of fresh air for developers.
 
While regulatory overhang continues to weigh on near term sentiment, we reiterate that Singapores property market is past the worst of policy intervention and believe the government could start to roll back cooling measures in 2016. Better affordability and normalisation of interest rates are the key triggers, the report said.
 
While change in measures will not arrest home price declines, it should bring a rebound in sales volume and remove a key overhang developer stocks, Maybank Kim Eng added.

It's useful to refer to this criteria of some people when purchasing a private apartment. This is also one of my criteria for own stay purposes (HDB or private). Nothing about HDB, even a neighbor looking into my unit or my balcony is not preferable to me.
 
But truth be told, such places are getting rarer over the years.
 
And depending on the primary purpose of the move, this criteria may or may not be important to some others.

5 Reasons Why It’s Still a Terrible Time to Buy Singapore Property
JULY 27, 2015
5 Reasons Why It’sStill a Terrible Time to Buy Singapore Property
By Gerald Tay (guest contributor)
 
Tempted to buy a property due to the falling prices? Think again. In this article I will go through five reasons why I think it’s still a terrible time to buy Singapore property.
 
1. Property prices are still high for mass market homes
 
Since Q1 2009, prices in the Core Central Region (CCR) have risen 30 percent, 42 percent in the Rest of Central Region (RCR), and 60 percent in the Outside Central Region (OCR).
 
Since the peak in Q3 2013, prices of mass market homes have fallen a measly 5.5 percent. Properties in the OCR are still overpriced. Mass-market home prices haven’t dropped as much as those for luxury housing. Rental incomes are falling and vacancy rates are rising. A huge oversupply is looming on the horizon.
 
The bottom is still far from sight even though vested players claim it will happen in the next three to six months. While new home sales have dropped significantly, prices have stayed relatively high due to developers’ holding power.
 
There is still room for a further decline of property prices in the OCR. Investment opportunities will arise over the next couple of years when prices decline further.
 
My last purchase of a Singapore residential property was in mid-2012 before the policies came in. I won’t be re-entering the Singapore residential market until I see a further decline in prices. Prices need to drop by about 20 to 30 percent to make residential investments attractive again, not a measly 5.5 percent!
 
2. Interest rates are low but rising
 
Property prices rose as interest rates fell, and property prices will fall if interest rates rise with a weakened economy.
 
The way to win the game is to have cash on hand to buy at a low price when others cannot borrow very much because of high interest rates and the constraint of the debt servicing ratio. Then you get a low price, and you get capital appreciation caused by future interest rate declines. To buy an expensive property or believe in the fallacy of “affordable” property at a time of low (and rising) interest rates and high prices is a mistake.
 
It is far better to pay a low price with high interest rates than a high price with low interest rates, even if the mortgage payment is the same either way.
 
3. Government property curbs are here to stay
 
Many are betting on a removal of the cooling measures. I don’t see the government removing property curbs for the next two years. With interest rates on the way up, there will be pressure. The policy is working, there is no reason whatsoever for the government to relax it.
 
When stringent property curbs are here to stay, this only means property prices are still high.
 
4. Buyers are still biting the marketers’ bait
 
The problem with buyers who act like lemmings is that they become obvious targets for clever marketers. In today’s property market, how does a seller of real estate use human weaknesses to sell and profit?
 
Here’s a case study from the latest property launch near Seletar:
 
The Solution – Sell, market and lure “desperate” buyers with under $1,000 per-square-foot on average condominium units to beat the TDSR (Total Debt Servicing Ratio).
 
The Outcome – 1,110 lemmings rushed to snap up smaller units with empty cheques and balloting. 78% of project was sold within a weekend.
 
The Profits – 1,400 small unit apartments are cramped into every space possible.
 
This new successful sales model will soon be copied by other developers. As long as foolish buyers keep biting, sellers will continue to sell to them. Watching others get rich during boom times while you don’t is terrible enough. Lemmings want it now and that’s why they are prime targets today.
 
5. We may have an even greater financial crisis coming
 
Look for falling oil prices and another scare in China to spook the speculators, followed by a series of growing defaults like in 2008, but worse. They’re also kidding themselves if they think they can stop everybody from selling their stocks (look at China).
 
And expect the global crash that follows to be even more brutal thanks to all the financial manipulation in the system.But even beyond a global stock bubble, housing bubble, fracking bubble, and pension problems, there are signs of economic destruction across the world.
 
The air has been let out of China’s stock market. Commodity prices are down across the board to the detriment of the world’s emerging markets.Long-term interest rates are rising despite global efforts to suppress them with continued stimulus.Europe is enlarging the black hole of Greece by funnelling even more money into it. The euro zone as a whole has an unemployment rate over 10%. Japan is caught in a downward demographic spiral.
 
Chaos is erupting. And despite efforts to stop the global economic system from melting down, free market forces are finally starting to show governments and central banks who’s in charge. That’s the simple, bitter truth of it.
 
Inaction for now is the best action for savvy buyers and investors.Many are tuned in to the devastating market forces ahead. Those who are listening will be the best prepared. Those who have been patiently waiting on the side-lines and preparing themselves to take advantage of the coming crisis will be best rewarded.
 
For the buyers of today, I wish them luck.
 
A different take from the usual "Analysts" who always says now is the best time to buy...
[laugh]

 
very nice article.
 
And hence some who missed the boat used this article as a saving grace.
 
Right now, unless they revert or remove TDSR, I don't see how those in their 50's that has a reasonably large reserve will qualify for a loan.
 
AND IF it drop by 30%. I think you have more to worry then spot a bargain to pick as at that point in time, it will be taking a key to go to the reserves or your invested socks would have also plummet OR the back may start to call up the loan for review and top up..

All is not lost for developer stocks even as home prices crash: analysts
 
Share prices could rally soon.
 
A gloomy home price outlook is always a bad sign of things to come for developer stocks, but analysts say they have a reason to be optimistic.
 
Although home prices are often used as the key indicator for developer stocks, Maybank Kim Eng analysts argue that an improvement in sales volume could cause shares to rally even while property prices are falling.
 
We believe developer stocks can still rally despite the dire home price outlook over the next few years. In fact, this occurred in 15 out of the 31 quarters of home price contraction since 4Q97, said the report.
 
For instance, Maybank Kim Eng said that City Developments Limited (CDL) managed to buck a past downturn by increasing its sales. In the fourth quarter of 2001, CDL's share price jumped by 44.7%, even as home prices fell by a significant 4.3%.
 
CDLs share price rally was driven by a 43% surge in home sales volume and a series of off-budget measures introduced by the government to reverse cooling measures implemented over the years, Maybank Kim Eng said.
 
They added that home sales volume is headed for a rebound soon due to a potential lifting of cooling measures next year. This could provide a whiff of fresh air for developers.
 
While regulatory overhang continues to weigh on near term sentiment, we reiterate that Singapores property market is past the worst of policy intervention and believe the government could start to roll back cooling measures in 2016. Better affordability and normalisation of interest rates are the key triggers, the report said.
 
While change in measures will not arrest home price declines, it should bring a rebound in sales volume and remove a key overhang developer stocks, Maybank Kim Eng added.

 
What crash?
 
These analists really talking nonsense.

Far East Organization recently launched 10 new units under phase two of its Greenwood Mews residential development.
 
The 103-year leasehold project comprising 62 two-storey cluster landed homes sits on a 113,734 sq ft site  the last major land parcel in the exclusive Greenwood area in Bukit Timah.
 
Each unit is over 3,000 sq ft in size and comes with five bedrooms. Facilities within the development include swimming pools and BBQ cabanas.
 
Prices start from $3.75 million for a 3,100 sq ft unit, inclusive of an additional special discount of six percent. In a statement, the developer said the discount will be offered to the first five buyers of the phase two launch.
 
In the phase one launch, four out of seven units released were sold.
 
There are limited numbers of cluster landed homes available in Singapore generally. With the scarcity of such developments, especially in this well sought-after Greenwood precinct, coupled with enhancements in the living environment, Greenwood Mews holds long term enduring value for owner-occupiers and investors alike, said Shaw Lay See, chief operating officer, property sales business group at Far East.
 
Meanwhile, public transport connectivity in the Bukit Timah area will be enhanced with the completion of the Downtown Line 2 in December this year. Plans are also underway to transform the nearby Rail Corridor into a continuous green public space.
 
Greenwood Mews is expected to achieve TOP in Q3 2016.

Reserve site in Upper Serangoon triggered for tender
PUBLISHED OCT 2, 2015, 5:00 AM SGT
 
99-year condo plot near mall and MRT station likely to draw keen interest
Jacqueline Woo
 
A condominium site in Lorong Lew Lian in Upper Serangoon has been launched for sale by public tender.
 
The sale was triggered for the reserve list plot after a developer committed to a minimum bid price of $250 million last month.
 
The 99-year leasehold site is opposite Paya Lebar Methodist Church and near the Serangoon MRT station and Nex mall.
 
The 150,710.74 sq ft plot, which is on the Government Land Sales programme for this half of the year, can yield about 465 units and has a maximum permissible gross floor area of 452,137.61 sq ft.
 
The site is expected to draw keen interest from developers, given its well-connected location.
 
Mr Nicholas Mak, executive director of SLP International, said the land parcel could draw more than 10 bids, with the top ranging from $630 to $700 per sq ft per plot ratio (psf ppr).
 
"The site is in quite a good location, not too far from the Circle Line and North-East Line MRT stations. It is also in a particular part of Serangoon where there has not been a lot of new launches recently. This could spell buying interest."
 
Mr Ong Kah Seng, director of R'ST Research, said bidding interest will likely be "fairly warm - though not overwhelming, as the Total Debt Servicing Ratio is very likely to stay even if other cooling measures are lifted in 2016".
 
He said the sale could have been triggered partly due to a "slight improvement in developers' sentiments" as some are banking on the possibility that the property cooling measures may be lifted now that the elections are over.
 
Mr Ong expects the average project selling price to be in the $1,300 psf to $1,350 psf range, given that the break-even price is about $1,100 psf.
 
"There is strong HDB upgraders' demand for private condos in the north-eastern locality, and Serangoon (Central) offers the best of all worlds - it is more centrally located compared to Hougang, Sengkang and Punggol, and... is more affordable compared to Potong Pasir."
 
Mr Ong noted that recent condominium launches in the area, such as High Park Residences in Fernvale Road and Botanique at Bartley in Upper Paya Lebar Road, have received an "overwhelming" response from buyers.
 
Average prices at High Park Residences over the last six months, for instance, stand at about $990 psf, according to Squarefoot Research.
 
The tender for the site will close at noon on Nov 5, said the Urban Development Authority yesterday.
 
Any tender below the minimum bid price of $250 million will not be considered, it added.

Picking the best unit in a property project
OCTOBER 5, 2015 
 
 
Do you like visiting showflats of new launch projects? Was that once your favourite weekend activity before you bought your present home? Me too. Except that I didnt stop doing so even after I bought five properties.
 
 
Have you chosen a good unit?
 
In fact, I have visited well over a hundred showflats since year 2000. Now I can step into any sales gallery, flip the sales brochure for five minutes, and point out from the project model which blocks and units are the best ones. The marketing agents serving me are often surprised how I manage to do so in such a short time.
And let me share with you a little-known fact: Units that are priced higher, or blocks that are selling fast, are not necessarily the best blocks or units in a development.
Why? Because most buyers decide on their choice based on the recommendations of their property agents. Many are excited first-time buyers or upgraders who are inexperienced. More are amateurs who cant tell the difference between a good and a bad unit.
I believe that you are the other type of buyers who care about buying a good fengshui condo or HDB unit for your own stay, or you are serious about investing in a good quality private property. Because if you are one of those buyers who barely spend an hour in a sales gallery and buy just any unit there, you wont be reading my blog and sign up as a follower anyway.
 
 
Why you cant rely on your property agent
 
Property buyers often empty their hard earned money to buy a property without knowing the problems of the units they bought. Unfortunately, it is not in the interest of the developers, marketing agents or property agents to share tips with buying on how to pick a good unit. Their job is to move off the shelves blocks in the launch phase, star buys of the week and unsold units in the project.
That is the reason why property agents will tell you that west sun is good for drying clothes, and that expatriate tenants from western countries enjoy watching sunset. No laundry area to dry clothes is a new trend because modern families tend to use washer-dryer or go for laundry service. Hall too cramped to place a dining table is fine because couples prefer to have dinners on two bar stools in front of a bar top table or on the sofa to eat and watch TV at the same time 
 
 
Four tips to pick a good unit
 
 
Tip #1: Visit the actual site, not the sales gallery.
 
In the past, showflats are open house in a completed project and sales galleries are built on the actual site. Nowadays it is common to see the actual site and the sales gallery at different locations. Misunderstandings arise because:
1. The location of the sales gallery is accessible, but the actual site may not be.
2. The advertisement says it is just next to or a few minutes away from the MRT station. But it doesnt specify whether it is a few minutes walk, run or drive.
3. It highlights the proximity to two or three train stations. But the actual site may not be near to any one of them.
4. The sales gallery is surrounded by lush greenery, open space and nice view. But blocks in the actual site may see HDB blocks, another development or a religious place.
 
 
Tip #2: Ask what they dont tell, not what they want you to know.
 
If you have done your homework before stepping into a sales gallery, the things that the property agent tells you in the first ten to fifteen minutes you should already know.
A property investor once shared with me two principles to stick to in a sales gallery:
1. Pay a deaf ear to whatever the sales rep is telling you, like the skill you mastered after years of living with a nagging spouse.
2. Focus on things the sales rep doesnt tell you. Show your utmost curiosity by asking questions like a three-year-old.
If you are an experienced property buyer, you should immediately tell what they forget to show in the showflat, like a bad view from the window, or that obstructing pillar in the unit.
 
 
Tip #3: Study the sitemap, not the project model.
 
The project model, just like the showflats, are often not built up to scale. It is an artists impression for your reference only: Buildings blocking the panoramic view are not found there. The open sea view can only be seen from super high floors. Two blocks too near to the opposite ones are removed to make the development look more spacious.
Learn how to read directions and where sunlight and wind come from. Know the impact of all condo facilities that are built near to your block, including swimming pool, water feature, barbeque area, tennis court, carpark entrance and rubbish collection area.
 
 
Tip #4: Spend time on the floor plans, not the showflat units.
 
Wonder why a bare unit or your new unit is always smaller than what you see in the showflat and from the floor plan?
Learn how developers calculate floor areas. Know the differences of strata area versus GFA (Gross Floor Area), construction floor area versus sellable floor area, and built-in area versus open-air area.
Understand the pros and cons of different development, including walk-up apartment, mansionette, shoebox units, penthouse, cluster housing or townhouse.
Learn how to draw a rectangular block of a unit and locate the centre which is the heart of the property. Identify all the layout problems in the living room, dining area, kitchen, toilets and bedrooms.

1. Pay a deaf ear to whatever the sales rep is telling you, like the skill you mastered after years of living with a nagging spouse.
2. Focus on things the sales rep doesnt tell you. Show your utmost curiosity by asking questions like a three-year-old.
If you are an experienced property buyer, you should immediately tell what they forget to show in the showflat, like a bad view from the window, or that obstructing pillar in the unit.
 
 
Tip #3: Study the sitemap, not the project model.
 
The project model, just like the showflats, are often not built up to scale. It is an artists impression for your reference only: Buildings blocking the panoramic view are not found there. The open sea view can only be seen from super high floors. Two blocks too near to the opposite ones are removed to make the development look more spacious.
Learn how to read directions and where sunlight and wind come from. Know the impact of all condo facilities that are built near to your block, including swimming pool, water feature, barbeque area, tennis court, carpark entrance and rubbish collection area.
 
 
Tip #4: Spend time on the floor plans, not the showflat units.
 
Wonder why a bare unit or your new unit is always smaller than what you see in the showflat and from the floor plan?
Learn how developers calculate floor areas. Know the differences of strata area versus GFA (Gross Floor Area), construction floor area versus sellable floor area, and built-in area versus open-air area.
Understand the pros and cons of different development, including walk-up apartment, mansionette, shoebox units, penthouse, cluster housing or townhouse.
Learn how to draw a rectangular block of a unit and locate the centre which is the heart of the property. Identify all the layout problems in the living room, dining area, kitchen, toilets and bedrooms.
They missed the most important point. Low ball the seller or developer. Give them a counter of $500 a foot if you're offered $1500 a foot. Be ready to walk away if they tell you you're delusional but most important of all, low ball them when you have a signed check or a briefcase full of cash and tell them I can full cash settle this transaction! Muayhahahaha 😂

I see. So the developer bought the plot for 800+ psf and we can get them to build for us, don't charge any costs, and sell at less than 50% of cost?
 
Really must learn this skill from you. I am trying to use that strategy to buy a good watch. 
 
Can teach me please?

At $500 a foot, for $1500, I should be getting 3 feet?

3 square feet is only enough to stand and sleep.
 
In Korea, there are feasible coffin rooms for stay at 3 square meter, at least can lie down and sleep. Maybe can use laptop. That is 32 sq feet, which costs $16,000 for Porker prices and $48,000 for developer prices.

Mercs, you just identified MCFers to property agents with your very well done piece of advice.
I do that all the time. You forget to mention to bring some person along to entertain the sales rep. Such as showing great interest in the presentation, the distraction. Nowadays I do note the sales person tend to double team the buyers.
Some questions such as where are the water tanks located, ergo water pressure. How high is the ceiling?  What brand is the elevator? 
 
Dun fixate on floor space only, the depth of the unit is important, unless you plan to be on your back most of the time.
 
Location by T2 is important, not the way he worded it.
Exclusivity does not mean pride, more that the search for uniformity -- comfort.
 
Similar ability groups, similar tastes, similar behaviors.
 
Like that recent corner terrace detach to bungalow...location. 
The public housing versus the pvt housing disparity is huge. You couldn't pay me enough to go live there with people who think that I am a rich atas prick. I am not, I just see and think differently.  Very different. 
 
I am sure there are some atas who came out of 3 rm HDB flats here. Yep, GCB owners. 
 
Say the estate redwood avenue is in,
Got fellali, wah can hear the saxxy growl. People are in similar ability brackets and achievements.
 
But, this offering of pvt next to HDB has its advantages, for government -- slum prevention. There will be owners who live between the two. Rental and self stay. Which would bring extra income and expenditure to a elderly estate....money money come.
 
Wonder what will happen ten years down the road? Better keep the money under the mattress.....

5 External Factors Affecting The Value Of Your Property
 
Grace Cheng
updated October 20, 2015
 
At GET.com we maintain complete editorial integrity on our content & provide transparent & unbiased information. Companies don't pay us to include their products although we receive a compensation when you successfully apply to products from our partners.
 
The truth is that the price you pay for a property in Singapore (and elsewhere) is not necessarily its value.
 
There are many other factors that can affect property value – these can be related to its environment or to the property itself.
 
When buying a new home, what external factors should you look out for to ensure your property value appreciates over the years?
 
We at GET.com show you the 5 main external factors that affect property value:
 
1. Location
 
This is one key factor in driving up property value. Most people pay for a centralised location near town or the Central Business District.
 
For instance, a 4-room HDB flat in Tanjong Pagar is very likely to fetch a higher price than a 5-room flat in SengKang.
 
2. Access To Transportation
 
We all know that it is extremely expensive to own a car here, so public transport is the main type of transportation that people use to commute on a daily basis.
 
If you home is near an MRT or has many direct buses to town, you can expect it to have a better value compared to one further away from accessible public transport.
 
This is also known as the "MRT Effect", where properties nearer to the MRT command a premium.
This is also a reason why homes which have had the good fortune of enjoying the new lines of MRT (circle and downtown) seem to have a new lease of life and saw their value rise.
 
However, there is a downside to being near the MRT as well. There are other considerations such as the noise level created by being near a main road or the MRT track, which could subsequently reduce the quality of living for the owner, as well as the property value.
 
3. Value Of Neighbourhood Property
 
Transaction prices of nearby properties have been known as a well-used indicator for a property's value.
 
If a similar unit nearby fetched a good value, you can expect to use that as a justification to ask for a higher valuation of your own property.
 
4. Layout/Direction
 
This could be the direction your flat is facing or how your apartment is shaped (square or L-shaped).
 
The direction your unit is facing can be a concern because most people try to avoid a place where the living rooms are directly facing the morning or evening sun, which can warm up the apartment and make it uncomfortable for the owners.
 
5. Nearby Amenities
 
Everyone loves convenience, and if you are already staying slightly away from town, you would want to be able to buy your daily necessities near your home.
 
Thus, many people look for supermarts, the availability of food courts as well as sporting facilities near their place. The presence of quality educational institutions can be a criteria for parents as well.
 
In recent years, more and more potential property buyers look at the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Master Plan as a guide to forecasting the value of properties.
 
The building of a new mega-mall, bus terminal or MRT station will likely inflate the value of nearby properties.
 
Similarly, the building of a crematorium will adversely affect nearby home values as well, so it is worthwhile to take your time to do some research.

Strong turnout at Principal Garden preview
Oct 22, 2015
 
 
UOL Group Limited (UOL) and Kheng Leong Company’s (Kheng Leong) latest residential development – Principal Garden – attracted close to 3,000 buyers at its public viewing last weekend despite the current soft property market.
 
It was crowds galore at Principal Garden’s showflat when close to 3,000 potential home buyers thronged the showflat at Prince Charles Crescent when it opened to the public on the weekend of 17 to 18 October. Industry watchers expect the newly launched project located off Alexandra Road to boost transaction volume in the Rest of Central Region (RCR) when sales commence at the end of the month.
 
“In the city fringe areas, we are expecting a few more new projects to be launched before the end of the year, such as Principal Garden at Prince Charles Crescent. These projects are expected to boost transaction volume in the RCR, and moving forward, we should see prices holding steady for the rest of the year, while transaction volumes remain robust,” Eugene Lim, Key Executive Officer and Head of Research at ERA Singapore was quoted as saying in a recent interview with PropertyGuru.
 
Strong attributes and attractive pricing
 
Despite the current soft property market, developments that have strong attributes such as low quantum, proximity to amenities and MRT stations will still draw buyers as seen during the Principal Garden preview.
 
“The turnout in Principal Garden over the weekend has been encouraging and we saw a good mix of investors and owner occupiers. We are offering buyers a high quality project at a very attractive average price of around $1,600 psf for the initial phase. Last year, we bought the site at a very reasonable price, and hence we are now able to pass on the savings to buyers. We believe buyers are able to see the value and investment potential of Principal Garden,” shared Anthony Wong, General Manager of Marketing at UOL.
 
Thoughtfully designed condominium in a prestigious location
 
Comprising 663 units in total, Principal Garden is nestled in an exclusive neighbourhood on the fringe of Mount Echo, Jervois, and Bishopsgate area. Keen buyers can pick from a good mix of one- to four-bedroom apartment types, as well as penthouse units depending on their requirement and budget. Regardless of which unit they pick, buyers can be assured that the interiors are all meticulously outfitted with top-of-the-line fittings and finishes. In fact, buyers can look forward to engineered timbre flooring, high-end appliances and kitchen cabinets as well as marble for master bath, which are comparable to the specifications at luxury condo Nassim Park Residences (also developed by UOL and Kheng Leong).
 
The development is designed with an 80:20 “garden living” concept – 80 percent vast foreground of lawn, pools, and other amenities, and 20 percent site coverage. The result is a beautiful composition of multi-layered, multi-functional spaces for relaxation, recreation, community and celebration. Facilities include a shared bicycle facility to capitalise on the Alexandra Park Connector, a substantial-sized gym of 2,018 sq ft and the Principal Sky Club on the 24th storey with its own infinity pool.
 
One- and two-bedders set to be a hit
 
While the development has a wide range of units, about 70 percent of the units at Principal Garden are one- and two-bedroom units with sizes ranging from 484 sq ft to 807 sq ft – perfect for singles, young couples, and investors seeking an affordable property that is situated close to town. The one-bedroom units will be priced from $770,000, while the two-bedroom units from $1.18 million. According to online reports, most of the projects in the Alexandra area have already sold their one- and two-bedroom units.
 
Last night at the South East Asia Property Awards 2015, UOL clinched the Best Mid-Range Condo Development (Singapore) for Riverbank@Fernvale and Special Recognition in Corporate Social Responsibility.

Thomson Impressions to be launched at S$1,400 psf on average (Amended)
Public preview to start on Saturday; this will be China-based Nanshan Group's maiden private condominium project in Singapore, developed with Vico Construction

CHINA-based Nanshan Group is set to launch its maiden private condominium project in Singapore at an average price of S$1,400 per square foot (psf) when it starts selling on Oct 31.
 
The public preview for the 288-unit Thomson Impressions at Lorong Puntong will commence this Saturday.
 
Nanshan Group has lately formed a joint venture with Vico Construction Pte Ltd to develop the project, which sits on a 99-year leasehold land parcel acquired for S$173.57 million or S$731.10 psf per plot ratio in October 2014.
 
 
Vico Construction is owned by Zuo Haibin - who was executive director of Qingjian International (South Pacific) Group until February - and his wife Li Ming Hua.
 
Mr Zuo, who has been appointed director of the JV's special purpose vehicle NS Property (Thomson) Pte Ltd and the spokesman for Thomson Impressions, said the project is one that goes "back to basics", targeting occupiers amid a deluge of shoebox units in the market.
 
With the target group in mind, the units are designed such that the master bedrooms can accommodate a king-sized bed and the junior bedrooms can accommodate a queen-sized bed, Mr Zuo pointed out.
 
The project is some 600 metres by walking distance to the upcoming Bright Hill MRT station along the Thomson MRT line. ERA Realty and Huttons are the marketing agents for the project.
 
Citing the project's strong locational attributes, small scale, pricing and the limited availability of resale units in the vicinity, Mr Zuo said he is confident of the sales take-up.
 
"We view the Thomson location favourably, an exclusive location that presents many possibilities; it is near an upcoming MRT and the Ai Tong school, and the Singapore Island Country Club," said Mr Zuo, a Singaporean permanent resident whose wife and son are Singaporeans. Song Jianbo, eldest son of China-based Nanshan Group founder Song Zuowen, has also lately become a Singaporean..
 
"We are here to stay in the long haul. We do not just do one project and walk away," Mr Zuo said. He came to Singapore in 1999 when Qingjian first started out in Singapore as a construction company before it branched into development business in 2008.
 
Vico Construction is now eyeing other opportunities to work with Nanshan Group, particularly in mass-market residential projects in good locations. Mr Zuo said he believes fundamental demand in Singapore for residential remains strong given its large potential pool of upgraders.
 
"If the Singapore economy continues to remain stable, the property market should be on a steady long-term uptrend," he said. Meanwhile, he is keeping his fingers crossed on any possibility of policy tweaking by the government.
 
Nanshan Group's business in China spans across multiple industries ranging from finance, aviation, real estate, education, tourism to garments. It has lately engaged Vico Construction to re-develop Irving Industrial Building, a 65,309 sq ft freehold site in Singapore that was bought through a collective sale for S$160 million. The re-development is still in planning stage.
 
According to Mr Zuo, Vico Construction was a dormant company when it was founded in 2008 by his wife Ms Li and a friend until he took over the stake from the friend and became its managing director after he quit Qingjian.
 
LSZ International Pte Ltd, a newly formed consultancy firm majority owned by Lee Chun Wye, is providing project management and development consultancy for Nanshan Group's Thomson Impressions and the Irving Industrial Building project. Prior to this, Mr Lee was executive director at ZACD Investments, deputy general manager at Soilbuild Group and manager at JTC Corporation.
 
Some 100 units in Thomson Impressions are one-bedroom units of 463 sq ft with prices starting from over S$600,000, while 72 units are two-bedders of 732-764 sq ft. There are 72 three-bedders of 1,055 sq ft and 34 three-bedroom premium units of 1,195 sq ft.
 
There are five penthouses and five strata-landed homes consisting of two pairs of semi-detached houses and one bungalow. Foreigners need to seek approval from Land Dealings Approval Unit of the Singapore Land Authority to purchase the strata-landed homes.
 
Amendment: In the earlier version, we mentioned that Nanshan Group founder Song Zuowen has become a Singaporean. This is incorrect. It is actually his eldest son Song Jianbo. We also corrected the purchase date for the land site at Lorong Puntong and a typo error on the name of majority shareholder of LSZ, Lee Chun Wye.

I think demand should be low given soft market condition.
 
Look at stock market it will tell you the current sentiment. As that is the leading indicator.

There are five penthouses and five strata-landed homes consisting of two pairs of semi-detached houses and one bungalow. Foreigners need to seek approval from Land Dealings Approval Unit of the Singapore Land Authority to purchase the strata-landed homes.
 
Amendment: In the earlier version, we mentioned that Nanshan Group founder Song Zuowen has become a Singaporean. This is incorrect. It is actually his eldest son Song Jianbo. We also corrected the purchase date for the land site at Lorong Puntong and a typo error on the name of majority shareholder of LSZ, Lee Chun Wye.

What ?!?! 1195sqft is premium? Best of the best ?
 
*facepalm*
 
No wonder those suakoo who buy a "premium" condo in such development think that they are so great and hv made it.  Nose high high.

If really must buy now, this comment from a recent article I read is useful:
 
For these potential purchasers, we suggest they look for areas where prices have fared relatively better in a down cycle, where there are relatively fewer units under construction and where there are structural changes in the infrastructure or government initiatives that could make the location more attractive for households to stay in. Look out for other research reports from us that will highlight some of these locations.

Why not deposit 80k from your safe into uob? They are having a promo now, can get a 1935 commemorative gold foil dollar. It isnt worth much but its all for nothing.

URA launches residential site in Clementi for sale
By Tay Hock Meng / The Edge Property, URA | October 23, 2015 7:06 PM MYT
 
 
 
URA has launched a 140,339 sq ft residential site at Clementi Avenue 1 for tender under the Confirmed List of the 2H2015 Government Land Sales (GLS) programme. The 99-year leasehold site has a maximum permissible gross floor area (GFA) of 491,189 sq ft, and can hold up to 460 residential units when fully completed.
 
Consultants like Nicholas Mak of SLP International says this site could attract developers’ interest due to its location, accessibility to Clementi Town and most importantly the absence of competition from new launches in the neighbourhood.
 
According to SLP’s Mak, there are three private condos nearby, one of which is the 956-year leasehold The Parc, where all 659 units are fully sold. The Parc was completed in 2010. Two other neighbouring projects, namely the 210-unit Waterfront @ Faber and the 755-unit Trilinq are both 99-year leasehold GLS sites purchased in 2013. Waterfront @ Faber has 57 unsold units as at end September with the latest median price achieved at $1,233 psf. Meanwhile, The Trilinq has 555 unsold units as at end September, with latest median price of $1,328 psf.
 
With just four condominium development sites launched in 2H2015 compared to five in 1H2015, Mak reckons the site could attract 10 to 16 bids, with top bids in the range of $314 million to $340 million ($639 to $692 psf per plot ratio).
 
The tender for the site at Clementi will close on December 9.

Just my personal opinion :)
If one is working in the west or wanna staying near parents in the western side, then maybe can consider buying...  
whether primarily for own staying or renting out later... just decide later...
 
However if one is working in the city or have no other business in the west.. then maybe can consider buying somewhere else...
traffic at AYE and PIE... during office hours is really a nightmare .... and if wanna board MRT, gonna be like jam since most crowd would have got up at Jurong East...
And if talking abt air quality, haze in the west is always bad .... as compared to other areas ...and didn't the everyday haze level confirm abt this? ...
 
Oh ya, I have been staying in the west for 30 years till after I got married... oops... just my personal opinions with no offence :)

Singapore's 10 swankiest condos of all time
 
One of them costs a whopping $42m.
 
While it's true that a host of government cooling measures have dampened the residential property market in Singapore, with many discouraged by a sales tax of 18% for most foreigners, it still remains amongst top international markets for real estate.
 
A recent survey by YouGov for instance ranked Singapore as the 3rd most preferred country for overseas foreign property buyers, next to Australia and Malaysia. After all, apart from being a popular destination for expats as a key demand factor, Singapore is also known for some iconic high-end projects that redefine luxury living.
 
Singapore Business Review spoke with several property experts to list down some of what they think are the stylishly luxurious condos of all time.

If u get a unit nearer the avenue 1 side, it'll be a pretty quiet neighbourhood. Avenue 1 doesn't have much traffic going through it.
And it's a short walk to Clementi central, though the MRT station is at the furthest part of the central from here.

Bumper sales likely at launch of Thomson condo
 
PUBLISHED OCT 31, 2015, 5:00 AM SGT
 
More than half of its 288 units are priced under $1.2 million
Joyce Lim
 
Experts tip bumper sales at the launch of Thomson Impressions condominium today, given that more than half of its 288 units are priced under $1.2 million.
 
Ms Avis Wong, associate marketing director of PropNex Realty, noted yesterday: "Anything under a million is a sweet spot. Above a million, it could be a psychological barrier for some."
 
She noted that since cooling measures such as the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) came in to restrict lending, property has been less about price per square foot (psf) and more about affordability.
 
 
"In a quieter market, projects that are priced to sell tend to see great response regardless of location, such as High Park Residences where one-bedroom units were going for under $400,000," Ms Wong added.
 
The 99-year leasehold Thomson Impressions has an average price of $1,400 psf, which values the smallest one-bedder of 43 sq m at $670,000.
 
The 19-storey condo in Lorong Puntong, which is expected to be completed in late 2019, is near the upcoming Bright Hill MRT station and Ai Tong Primary School. It is also close to the Singapore Island Country Club.
 
The condo is being developed by NS Property (Thomson), a joint venture between China-based Nanshan Group and Vico Construction.
 
The estate will have 100 one-bedders priced between $670,000 and $780,000; 72 two-bedroom units of 68 to 71 sq m for between $980,000 and $1.15 million; and 106 three-bedders of 98 to 111 sq m. These are going from $1.35 million to $1.55 million. There are also five penthouses and five strata-landed homes priced from $2.75 million to $2.85 million.
 
Chestertons managing director Donald Han said the price, in addition to its location, is a lure for buyers. And with just 288 units, Thomson Impressions has an advantage over bigger mass market projects, he added. "It's a fairly small cluster of units so buyers won't have too many competitors if they are buying for investment. There is also less competition for tenants and resale.
 
"HDB upgraders are always looking for projects that are $1.2 million and below. The price of Thomson Impression mirrors the price of Thomson Three, which is also around $1,400 psf, and it sold fairly well with only eight units left."

Two condo launches over the weekend receive good buyers’ responses

Bumper sales likely at launch of Thomson condo
 
PUBLISHED OCT 31, 2015, 5:00 AM SGT
 
 
"In a quieter market, projects that are priced to sell tend to see great response regardless of location, such as High Park Residences where one-bedroom units were going for under $400,000," Ms Wong added.
 
The 99-year leasehold Thomson Impressions has an average price of $1,400 psf, which values the smallest one-bedder of 43 sq m at $670,000.
 
The 19-storey condo in Lorong Puntong, which is expected to be completed in late 2019, is near the upcoming Bright Hill MRT station and Ai Tong Primary School. It is also close to the Singapore Island Country Club.
 

 
The irony is, if the buyer can only afford the typical units here, he/she won't be able to afford Island membership, and the units won't be liveable for a family with school going kids wanting to enter Ai Tong....

Sorry maybe it is just only me.

Wahahahahaha, hitting the nail on the head.
 
Why does anyone want a mickey mouse unit near ai tong or SICC?
 
Wait wait, let me think.....
 
I know i know, the developer is hoping that many many rich people can just throw money to buy a unit so that their children can register and get into ai tong?  Or rent out to people who want to get their children into aitong?  Basically bank everything on an aitong? 
 
Or maybe they think very rich golfing retirees would sell their detached houses nearby and buy a small unit there so that they can continue to go SICC to play golf?
 
Oh wonderful development isnt it!  Huat ah !

Can see that they are selling on quantum of price which fits into people loan profile to get sales...... Which the corresponding size is not practical for normal family housing demand. This translate to speculative play profile demand and we know that this layer is thinning out as well, held back to a large extend by the tdsr. That's the reason the developer are crying out loud to get gov to remove the cooling measure.

2BR: 68 to 71 sqm - factoring in balcony space, quite close to 3rm HDB?
 
3BR: 98 to 110 sqm - factoring in balcony space, around 4rm HDB?
 
Not luxurious on space but decent and practical?

Agree, especially after factoring aircon ledges, balcony and yard. Some balconies are already about the size of living room. Hdb flats generally have bigger rooms, esp when comparing to recent condo sizes.

private condo developer, their discounted useable space is "unbelievable" ... "speechless"
minus here minus there minus everywhere ... nothing much left for room
a normal guest room can't even fit a queen size bed
even you can squeeze a queen size bed ... you need to walk sideway like a crab ... LOL
don't even get me started with the simi open kitchen concept which means actually there is no space for kitchen
kitchen is integrated to the living room like 2-in-1

If 85 sqm the DBSS flat we discussed before I would agree on the crabbiness after taking out the balconies and ledges.
 
But nowadays in the sales purchase document, the developer has to specify each "room" or area how much space is allocated. And these spaces can be really measured upon completion. So must really look into it.
 
In this case, size wise, can't say if it is really comparable to existing HDBs. Must look into the space allocation specifically. Anyone has the floorplan to share?

Instead of looking at new ones , there are plenty of older ones which has being released for sometime and yet to be sold .
 
Those are consider "new" . Better than the rubbish ones recently.

Ok lah I fished online for a few floor plans. 
 
At max these spaces are just 10% of the unit area. Still have a good 85 to 90 sqm of space for 3 bedder, much like 4rm flat and 60 sqm for 2 bedder, much like 3rm flat.
 
It's a pity for those buyers who have committed to buy before the regulation to put on contract the internal layout spaces.

5 things a property investor should remember
By Ryan Khoo / Alpha Marketing, The Edge Property | November 3, 2015 9:32 AM MYT
 
 
The property market has cooled down a fair bit. Singapore has seen two consecutive years of price declines. Malaysia, meanwhile, has seen transaction volumes drop significantly and prices stagnate. Popular overseas investment destinations such as Melbourne, Sydney and London appear to be near their peak, with large incoming supply. The gap between buyers’ and sellers’ expectations is still too big and there does not seem to be much good news on the horizon for either party.
 
On the ground, we are seeing smaller crowds at show flats and property shows. Property agents are getting fewer enquiries and are seeing lower returns on their marketing dollar. A net total of 1,492 agents left the industry in the Council for Estate Agencies’ registration period ended March 2015.The figure is expected to rise in the next renewal exercise, which ends Oct 31.
 
In these times of despair and low morale, itis important to remember a few rules on property investing so that your decision- making remains solid.
 
 
 
Property markets work in cycles
 
What goes up, must come down. So say the critics of the property market who believe that prices must drop further in order to stimulate buying. But the lows of the current cycle are rarely lower than the lows of the previous cycle. Singapore property prices during the downturn of 2009 were higher than those in the stagnation years of 2001 to 2006.
 
Property prices in Singapore will drop further, but it is likely to be a very gradual drop and unlikely to return to 2009 levels. With more than 80% of citizens owning homes in the city state, the government will intervene to prevent a sharp price fall.
 
On the other hand, if you look at the glass as half full, having a property cycle also means that at some point in the future, prices will have to inch back up. And one factor driving prices back up is inflation.
 
 
 
Inflation is a property investor’s best friend
 
A lot of recent discussion about the property market is on supply versus demand. Less has been said about the impact of inflation on prices. A bowl of noodles today costs $4 versus $1 some 30 years ago. People complain about the cost of living and how it only goes up. Similarly, the same can be said about construction and land costs. At some point, the replacement cost to construct a new property will be as high as, or higher than, the price of existing properties. This will push property prices upwards.
 
Singapore has a historical inflation rate of between 2% and 3%; Malaysia’s is in the 3%to 4% range. Property is a hedge against inflation, so the average annual price appreciation of a property over the long term should at least match inflation. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of private property prices in Singapore since 1993 is about 4%per annum, so it has actually outpaced inflation. In Kuala Lumpur, the CAGR since 2000is 6.5% per annum and in Johor, it is 3.2% per annum (although in 2011 to 2013, Johor grew faster than KL and Singapore). This is how the old adage “buy properties and wait” came to be.
 
If you can hold the property for five to 10 years, your price appreciation would be substantial even if you bought an average property at an average location. Too many investors get cold feet during the down cycle and exit too early, which brings me to my next point.
 
 
 
Stop micromanaging your investments
 
If your rents have dropped or you have trouble finding tenants, doing a quick sale to exit the investment is often not the best option.
 
Transaction costs for real estate are high and the property market is an extremely illiquid market, especially during a down cycle. This means you will take a longer time to find buyers and to transact. If you hold the property for a short time frame, you will not enjoy significant capital appreciation, and after taking away your transaction and holding costs, you will not make any money. This applies to Malaysian property investments as well. Singapore-based investors who buy into overseas markets such as Malaysia tend lose confidence easily as they have poorer visibility compared with locals.
 
This is the property market, not the share market! Do not get infected by “short-termism” and start dumping your investments during a down cycle. It is better to stay invested throughout the bad times and reap the rewards when the upcycle returns. If you have to lower your rent further to attract a tenant, it is still preferable to collecting nothing. An occupied property is better than one that is left empty.
 
Unless they are financially distressed with no job and income, I recommend property owners hold on and grab any qualified tenant they can get. If too many owners panic and sell, they will create a self-reinforcing downward pressure on their property price, which won’t end well.
 
 
 
The world environment is fragile. Guess what, bad news is not new.
 
One of the most important insights for an investor to understand is that no matter how intelligent he is, he will not be able to predict all the events of the next five years.
 
Today, China is slowing down, Europe is still weak and the US recovery is patchy. There is war in the Middle East and commodity economies such as Russia and Brazil are struggling. Singapore has just narrowly avoided a technical recession. Malaysia and Thailand are experiencing political issues and with Indonesia, it is always about the haze. It is hard to predict what other disasters or major events can happen.
 
Yet, life goes on. The civilised world has gone through numerous tumultuous events, many of which were worse than the ones we are experiencing now. We will survive and society will move forward. We just have to be in the position to reap when the harvest is ready.
 
 
 
Try being greedy instead of being fearful
 
Most investors I speak to today are fearful, and they have many valid concerns. There is a flip side to this situation. In this down market, the deals on offer are getting better. If we predict that this down cycle will stretch for another year or two, there is a lot of time for these deals to become fantastic. But you will only be aware of such deals if you are actively seeking them.
 
Unfortunately, too many people out there are still being influenced by bad news and are sitting out the market at a time when they should be paying it full attention. Try to look at the market greedily, rather than fearfully. A good investor buys low during the down cycle and sells high. A bad investor buys high in an up cycle, and tries to sell higher.
 
If you can remember the five points above, I think you will sleep better at night and perhaps look at the property market tomorrow in a different light. Property investing is fun, exciting and full of opportunities — but only if you choose to make it so.

Oh please tell us something we dont already know.
 
By the way, this goon is contradictory as all this may makes sense only if 1) one can buy/sell properties as easily as one can buy/sell marketable securities like stocks bonds etc. and 2) one is a tycoon with capacity to make mistakes and turn around...  Also thinking that this is now the low of a down cycle is complete naivety.  
 
I would like to know how many properties this goon (again from the Edge) has or is looking to buy immediately.  
 
So after so much , he is saying dont sell , just rent out first (who doesnt know)
Property is long term (who doesnt know, especially now that the CMs have prevented speculation, want to be short term also cannot lah, hah)
Hold 5 to 10yrs , profits surely substantial? (hhmmmm some people hold 20yrs and didnt make a cent in real dollar values) 
Unless no job or income then sell? (By that time, you wont be the only one without a job and income and selling)  
 
Anyway, mai spread fear , buy ah, chiong ah.

Don't be surprised if there are those (Gen Y and later especially) who prefer to pay 20-30% more per new square foot than to "settle" for more affordable (and more) old square foot. I have heard this several times from a few, although not sure if they really mean it or that's what they can afford.
 
I prefer more living space if given a choice, but I dread the more maintenance problems (and corresponding costs) that come with older developments. Maybe when closer to retirement have more time to deal with them then it will be more suitable.
 
When both spouses are in the midst of their careers, such issues are better to be avoided if possible in my opinion.

Bro, sorry to disturb your thoughts,  but just to be factual according to reports:
 
"The developers say most of the units sold were made up of two-, and three-bedroom units."
 
This hints at the profile and intention of the buyers.

Because Singaporeans are cheapskate. 
They buy becos of lower quantum and the developers know that.   
As long as it allows them to say that they own a piece of private property.
But still, units aplenty, more than enough to go around.
 
Other people stupid doesnt mean we have to be stupid too.

Thats excellent.
I love it when people screw themselves.
By the way, a good development will have no issues either than the occasional blown bulb which can be fixed within minutes.
 
Not sure what kind of maintenance you talking about unless you mean abused 20 yr old development.

Basically it does not escape the fact that some (I would even argue most) modern people are able to live in  these pretty well. These are not the 1 bedders you claimed. So if they buy to stay and be in proximity to the children's school, why should we call them names like twits or cheapskates? Like you said, buying for genuine occupation reasons you also agreed there is no best time.
 
My response was to larger 130sqm freehold units along Sims Ave posted by @Derricklah. Those I am aware of with affordable psf should be over 30 years old.

I asked him why not HDB. He said just married want new unit. Resales HDB was also too highly priced and new BTOs were not in his preferred locations.

I asked him why not HDB. He said just married want new unit. Resales HDB was also too highly priced and new BTOs were not in his preferred locations.

Don't be surprised if there are those (Gen Y and later especially) who prefer to pay 20-30% more per new square foot than to "settle" for more affordable (and more) old square foot. I have heard this several times from a few, although not sure if they really mean it or that's what they can afford.
 
I prefer more living space if given a choice, but I dread the more maintenance problems (and corresponding costs) that come with older developments. Maybe when closer to retirement have more time to deal with them then it will be more suitable.
 
When both spouses are in the midst of their careers, such issues are better to be avoided if possible in my opinion.

 
I'm usually worried about pipe chokes flooding the kitchen.
A lot of HDBs that are past 15-20 years have them even though i think HDB maintenance of these issues are already very good.
 
A lot of people flush all kinds of stuff down their drainage pipes. Oil and grease in particular.

Basically it does not escape the fact that some (I would even argue most) modern people are able to live in  these pretty well. These are not the 1 bedders you claimed. So if they buy to stay and be in proximity to the children's school, why should we call them names like twits or cheapskates? Like you said, buying for genuine occupation reasons you also agreed there is no best time.
 
My response was to larger 130sqm freehold units along Sims Ave posted by @Derricklah. Those I am aware of with affordable psf should be over 30 years old.

So sorry i replied you.  Bye

Reserve site in Upper Serangoon triggered for tender
PUBLISHED OCT 2, 2015, 5:00 AM SGT
 
99-year condo plot near mall and MRT station likely to draw keen interest
Jacqueline Woo
 
A condominium site in Lorong Lew Lian in Upper Serangoon has been launched for sale by public tender.
 
The sale was triggered for the reserve list plot after a developer committed to a minimum bid price of $250 million last month.
 
Mr Nicholas Mak, executive director of SLP International, said the land parcel could draw more than 10 bids, with the top ranging from $630 to $700 per sq ft per plot ratio (psf ppr).

11 bids for residential site close to Serangoon MRT
5 Nov, 2015
 
 
The tender for a 99-year leasehold residential site at Lorong Lew Lian (pictured) along Upper Serangoon Road closed today after attracting 11 bids, said the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).
 
Launched for sale on 1 October 2015, the 150,711 sq ft site has a maximum permissible gross floor area of about 452,138 sq ft.
 
The top bid of $321 million was submitted through a partnership between Verwood Holdings, a wholly-owned subsidiary of City Developments Limited (CDL), Intrepid Investments, a unit of Hong Leong Holdings, and TID Residential. This works out to around $710 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr).
 
The lowest bid of $265.9 million ($588 psf ppr) was jointly submitted by Tuan Sing-owned Episcia Land, and KBD Ventures, a unit of Koh Brothers.
 
A spokesperson for CDL said its bid for the triggered reserve site topped the tightly contested tenders by a 2.6 percent margin over 10 other bidders.
 
Located within an established housing estate, the land parcel is close to Serangoon MRT station, NEX Shopping Mall and several schools.
 
“In the event that we are awarded the site, CDL will explore a condominium development of between 12 to 13 storeys with over 500 units. Apartments on the higher floors will enjoy good views across the landed housing enclave.
 
“CDL is familiar with the precinct and has confidence in the potential of the site, having jointly-developed the fully-sold 702-unit Bartley Residences, and the 99 percent sold 868-unit Bartley Ridge,” added the spokesperson.
 
A decision on the award of the tender will be made after the bids have been evaluated.

Agree, especially after factoring aircon ledges, balcony and yard. Some balconies are already about the size of living room. Hdb flats generally have bigger rooms, esp when comparing to recent condo sizes.
 
Exactly, for some new condo the big balcony size giving ppl viewing from outside the wrong thinking that units are very big but actual fact buyers need to put their dinning tables at the balcony.
 
Kitchen too small? No worries, developer came up with a nice term "dry kitchen" but actually eat into the living room area.

MRT boon for 3 sleepy parts of S'pore
 
Redevelopment potential around Keppel, Cantonment and Prince Edward stations
Rennie Whang
 
The areas around three new MRT stations announced last week may be sleepy now, but expect this to change down the track.
 
Redevelopment potential is ripe near the sites of Keppel, Cantonment and Prince Edward stations, experts say. The trio will be part of the sixth stage of the Circle Line, to be completed in 2025.
 
Keppel Station is to be in Keppel Road, near Keppel Distripark and Keppel Terminal; while Cantonment will be integrated with the old Tanjong Pagar Railway Station. Prince Edward will be at one end of Shenton Way, near Palmer Road.
 
Other than Cantonment's site, zoned commercial, the other two are zoned as reserve sites under the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) Masterplan 2014.
 
This means the URA has much flexibility near the stations, said Ms Christine Li, director of Singapore research at Cushman & Wakefield.
 
As Cantonment will be an extension of the old railway station, ideas could include an integrated railway mall with a focus on food and beverage. It could also be a venue for cultural and lifestyle events to make use of the historic site, she said.
 
And, of course, it makes sense to have MRT users living nearby.
 
This is especially true for the thinly populated Keppel Station area. It is poised to be the gateway to the Southern Waterfront City and so it should see more residential and integrated residential and commercial developments, said Ms Li.
 
Few commercial projects are in the area, as it is in a comprehensive redevelopment zone - all to be under the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme when Keppel docklands move out, said Mr Alan Cheong, Savills Singapore research head.
 
So far, no GLS sites on the confirmed or reserve list are near the stations, but some mixed-development sites could be added in GLS programmes, he said.
 
But given the large supply of office space due from next year to 2018, it will be tough to get bidders excited about large office blocks.
 
Apart from undeveloped land in the three areas, the Government could slowly release the Marina Bay reclamation sites for development, Ms Li noted.
 
The new stations also bode well, longer term, for nearby properties.
 
On the residential side, these include Spottiswoode 18, Spottiswoode Residences, The Beacon and HDB estate Spottiswoode Park near Cantonment Station. 76 Shenton, completed last year, and Lumiere are near Prince Edward Station, noted R'ST Research director Ong Kah Seng.
 
The closest condos to Keppel Station are The Pearl@Mount Faber and Mount Faber Lodge.
 
"Sales activity has been quite sluggish in the three areas from last year due to the total debt servicing ratio... The areas are also not typical public housing estates... where there are many upgraders from nearby HDB estates," Mr Ong said.
 
Spottiswoode condo prices fell about 5 per cent last year and 3 per cent in the first nine months of this year. Lumiere prices fell 8 per cent last year and about 5 per cent in the first nine months, he estimated.
 
In the Mount Faber area, prices fell about 7 per cent last year and 5 per cent in the first nine months.
 
But prices should rise as completion of the stations nears, he noted.
 
In the Cantonment area, office buildings like Southpoint will be served by two MRT stations - Cantonment and Tanjong Pagar MRT stations. Klapsons The Boutique Hotel will also gain, said Mr Cheong.

Why did sales flop at Wing Tai's The Crest?
 
Only 18% of units have been sold.
 
Deep in Singapore's Core Central Region (CCR) stands The Crest, a luxury residential development by homegrown developer Wing Tai. First launched late in 2013, The Crest has haunted by extremely poor sales, with only 18% of total units sold after several years in the market.
 
A report by RHB Research delved on the reasons behind The Crest's poor sales performance. The Crest's sales are particularly dismal when compared to sales of rival developments Alex Residences and Mon Jervois, which have sold 58% and 40% of units, respectively.
 
Although it is easy to blame poor market sentiment for The Crest's misfortune, RHB Research noted that units in the development are simply too big and too expensive for average buyers.
 
"More than half of the units were over 1,000 sq ft which could mean that they were too large and too expensive for home buyers. Thanks to the weak property market, homebuyers are becoming increasingly price-sensitive. In terms of price quantum, a 1,000 sq ft unit at The Crest would cost approximately SGD1.7m. In comparison, if most of the units were built at half the size, it would be more affordable for homebuyer," said the report.
 
But all of The Crest's woes might boils down to just one reason: Wing Tai overpaid for the land that the development sits on.
 
"The root of the problem may lie in the hefty price Wing Tai paid for the land. The developer may not have been able to set lower prices for The Crest units, as it may have paid too much for the land back in Sep 2012," the report noted.
 
Wing Tai paid $960 psf/ppr for The Crest's land plot, which is significantly higher than land acquisition prices for neighboring developments.
 
"It would be easy to place the blame for The Crest’s weak performance on the weak sentiment in the market, although this was not entirely true. Both Alex Residence and Mon Jervois were launched at around the same period as The Crest, but sold more units than the latter,” the report said.

Testing the resilience of city fringe at Alexandra-Prince Charles
By Cecilia Chow / The Edge Property | November 11, 2015 10:00 AM MYT
 
UOL and Kheng Leong set to roll out Principal Garden at an average price of $1,600 psf. It will test the resilience of the city-fringe location at Alexandra-Prince Charles.
 
Leading an entourage of staff, property agents and reporters around the show flats of Principal Garden, Liam Wee Sin, deputy group CEO of UOL Group, points out the merits of the latest condominium that will spring up on Prince Charles Crescent, just off Alexandra Road. 
 
The oak flooring, high-end kitchen cabinets and appliances as well as full marble bathrooms are equivalent to the specifications at luxury condo Nassim Park Residences. The fully sold 100-unit Nassim Park Residences which was completed in 2011 is a joint-venture (JV) project between the listed UOL Group and privately held sister company Kheng Leong Co, controlled by the family of UOB chairman emeritus Wee Cho Yaw, along with Orix Capital. Another collaboration between UOL and Kheng Leong together with construction company Low Keng Huat was the 405-unit One-North Residences.
 
Principal Garden is a 70:30 JV between UOL and Kheng Leong. Located on a 269,000 sq ft linear site, the project contains four identical 24-storey blocks. The blocks are oriented such that most units will have an unblocked view of the Alexandra Canal and park connector or the Good Class Bungalow (GCB) neighbourhood of Jervois and Mount Echo Park. “The scheme by Architects 61 is refreshing in its simplicity as it allows every unit to have a unique view,” says Liam.
 
With the towers raised 15m above street level, units on the second level are equivalent to being on the sixth storey of a typical apartment block in the neighbourhood. Therefore, even the low-floor units will have unblocked views. The towers occupy just 20% of the site area, freeing up the remaining land area for landscaped gardens, swimming pools and other amenities, including a 1,516 sq ft gym, a wine cellar and lounge as well as clubhouse. There’s also a sky club on the 24th floor of one of the towers.
 
 
Price play
Set to debut on Oct 16 with sales to commence at the end of the month, Principal Garden contains 663 units, making it the largest condo — in terms of number of units — to be launched in the Alexandra area in a decade. Given that projects launched in the area over the past two years are still sitting on unsold units, competition is going to be “tough”, concedes Liam. “But we love it.”
 
Even though it’s considered to be part of the city fringe or Rest of Central Region (RCR), Principal Garden’s “unique vantage point” is that it’s at the border of an exclusive GCB neighbouhood, adds Liam. “On a micro-level, most of the projects in the area have already [substantially] sold their one- and two-bedroom units,” he continues. “So there is no real direct competition.”
 
About 73% of the units at Principal Garden are one- and two-bedroom units with sizes ranging from 484 to 807 sq ft. The one-bedroom units will be priced from $770,000 and two-bedroom units from $1.18 million. The remaining units include a mix of dual-key units, three-bedroom, three- and four-bedroom deluxe units, and five-bedroom penthouses. The average price for the initial 250 units to be released is expected to be around $1,600 psf.
 
“The price point [at Principal Garden] is lower than that for the surrounding projects, which have prices of $1,700 psf or higher, which therefore makes it a compelling buy,” says Mohamed Ismail Gafoor, CEO of PropNex Realty, the joint marketing agents of Principal Garden with CBRE and Huttons Asia.
 
UOL and Kheng Leong are able to offer a lower average selling price because they had purchased the site “at a reasonable price”, says Liam. The JV partners had won the 99-year leasehold site in a government tender with a top bid of $463.1 million or $821 psf per plot ratio (psf ppr) in April last year. The price is 14.5% lower than the $960 psf ppr paid for the 99-year leasehold site next door by a consortium made up of Wing Tai Holdings, Metro Holdings and UE E&C in September 2012.
 
 
 
Neighbourhood transformed
The Wing Tai-led consortium launched its project last year as the 469-unit The Crest, com prising three 23-storey towers and four five- storey blocks on a 256,000 sq ft site. A total of 90 units have been sold. Last month saw six units sold at a median price of $1,708 psf, according to URA data. Wing Tai and its consortium partners are unlikely to lower their selling prices to match Principal Garden’s.
 
“The Crest is targeted at a different market segment,” says an industry observer. “One- and two-bedroom units only make up about 30% of the total units. The units are also larger, with one-bedroom units starting at 614 sq ft, so the quantum price is also higher.”
 
Located behind Principal Garden is the 109-unit Mon Jervois, a five-storey project on Jervois Road by Singapore Land, which was delisted in August last year. Singapore Land is, in turn, a subsidiary of listed United Industrial Corp, an associate company of UOL which owns 44% of its shares. About 40% of the units at the 99-year leasehold Mon Jervois have been sold to date, at an average price of $1,941 psf based on caveats lodged with URA Realis.
 
Mon Jervois may be just behind Principal Garden, but it has a Jervois Road address which puts it in prime District 10.
 
Meanwhile, projects such as Principal Garden at Prince Charles Crescent and those located at Alexandra Road/Alexandra View, which are developments sitting on 99-year leasehold parcels purchased from government land sales in recent years, are considered to be in District 3 in the RCR or city-fringe neighbourhood.
 
For example, on Alexandra View and within a short walk of the Redhill MRT station is Alex Residences, a 99-year leasehold condo by Singapore Land. The project has 429 units in a single 40-storey tower. Launched at end-2013, 252 units (59%) have been sold to date. Two units were sold in September at a median price of $1,719 psf, according to URA data. As most of the lower floor units were sold at prices closer to $1,600 psf, the overall average price achieved to date is $1,676 psf (see table).
 
Next door to Alex Residences is Echelon, a 508-unit project by listed property giant City Developments Ltd. The 99-year leasehold condo previewed at end-December 2012. It was just a month before the before the seventh round of property cooling measures was introduced in January 2013, which included a hike in additional buyer’s stamp duty (ABSD). All except three units have been sold at an average price of $1,734 psf. The 43-storey twin tower project is expected to be completed towards end-2016.
 
Adjacent to Echelon is the 373-unit Ascentia Sky by Wing Tai, which was completed in 2013 and is fully sold to date. Ascentia Sky was launched in 2009 at an average price of $1,300 psf. The launch coincided with the completion of the 383-unit The Metropolitan by CapitaLand and Lippo Group, located close to the Red Hill MRT station. The 99-year leasehold The Metropolitan with twin 45-storey towers was launched in November 2006. At that time, the average price was about $780 psf.
 
“I remember when The Metropolitan first launched, people thought it was expensive for a city fringe location,” recounts Nicholas Mak, executive director of research & consultancy at SLP International. “And when Ascentia Sky was launched in 2009 at $1,300 psf, people again said it was expensive. But recent new launches in the area have been even higher, at $1,700 psf. So it seems like the Alexandra area is constantly testing new highs.”
 
However, with Principal Garden being launched at $1,600 psf, it’s evident the developer is pricing the project “very competitively”, adds Mak.
 
 
 
 
Prices double in less than a decade
A Singaporean property investor, Mr Lim, owns two units at The Metropolitan. They are both two-bedroom units. One was purchased for his own use, while the other is an investment property for rent. “The rentals there are very good,” says Lim. “A two-bedroom unit can still command $4,500 a month. But with more competition coming onstream in the future, rents may come off.” He had purchased both units when The Metropolitan first launched nine years ago, and rode the property wave.
 
There were two resale transactions at The Metropolitan in September. A 786 sq ft two-bedroom unit on the 31st floor changed hands for $1.13 million ($1,438 psf), while a 1,744 sq ft unit on the 40th floor of the other tower was sold for $2.35 million ($1,348 psf), according to caveats lodged with URA Realis. This shows that prices at The Metropolitan have doubled in nine years. “That’s why I welcome new developments,” says investor Lim. “They tend to drive up prices.”
 
Even older projects in the Prince Charles Crescent area have enjoyed a price uplift owing to the renewal brought on by the recent launches. Located on Prince Charles Crescent, off Alexandra Road, is the 384-unit Tanglin View. Developed by Far East Organization, the 99-year leasehold condo was completed in 2001. A recent transaction saw a 1,249 sq ft ninth-floor unit change hands for $1.438 million ($1,152 psf). The owner had paid $1 million ($801 psf) for the unit in 2001. The project was launched in 1998 and at that time, prices were hovering in the $800 psf range.
 
The government made available one more new site located adjacent to the Redhill MRT station on Sept 30. The 99-year leasehold site at Alexandra View is also next to The Metropolitan. It can be developed into a project with about 400 residential units, with commercial units on the first level.
 
“It will be a hotly contested site, given the location,” remarks a listed property developer who declined to be named. “All the established developers in that area will want to submit a bid for it. It’s one of the few remaining sites that’s located next to an MRT station and in a city fringe location. Alexandra remains an attractive location even though there are a lot of new projects there.” There is one more government parcel next to Alex Residences, but it has not been put up for sale yet.
 
The density at the Prince Charles neighbourhood is generally much lower than at Alexandra View, points out Daniel Lim, associate senior group director of Huttons. Therein lies the attraction of Principal Garden, he adds.
 
 
 
Future capital upside?
However, future capital upside will depend very much on market sentiments going forward, says a property consultant. With greater uncertainty in the global economy, home buyers are likely to be more cautious before committing to a purchase.
 
Capital upside will also depend on whether a project stands out in its neighbourhood. “Principal Garden’s linear orientation gives every unit a 180° view. The lower-floor units will be above the rooftop level of the GCBs as well as the condos in the Jervois area that are low-rise four- to five-storey blocks,” says Joseph Tan, executive director of CBRE residential services. “The project is therefore likely to see strong demand.”
 
Principal Garden’s amenities are another plus point, adds Tan. “Buyers are also becoming more discerning, and beyond price, they are also looking at projects by established developers who provide good layout and quality finishes.”
 
While there have been many launches, not all have done well, notes PropNex’s Ismail. Given that Principal Garden is a 10-minute drive to Orchard Road and the CBD, and a 10-minute MRT ride from the Redhill station to Raffles Place, the project will appeal to both investors and owner occupiers, adds Ismail.
 
According to SLP Research, over the past eight months, the median take-up rate based on the sales-to-launch ratio for RCR was 115.7% compared with the suburban neighbourhoods of OCR (Outside Central Region), which stood at 104.1%. A take-up rate of more than 100% would imply a reduction of developers’ inventory of unsold units, says SLP’s Mak. The figures, therefore, indicate a higher median take-up rate for RCR, which implies faster absorption of unsold stock relative to those in the OCR, he adds.
 
“Therefore, while the overall residential market may be sluggish, the RCR has remained the most resilient segment,” says Liam. “That’s why Thomson Three and Botanique at Bartley have done well, and why this project [Principal Garden] should do well too as they are all located within the RCR.”

I feel Crest is a better project than UOL's Principal Garden (PG) for own stay. More spacious, lower density, nicer design. UOL's eagerness to off load to investors is reflected in PG's large number of small units that border on shoebox sizes.

Maybe distance to MRT and also too many atas development to choose. Latecomers also paid the land price at the peak, so these are the market price supporters.

Redhill site draws 10 bids
Nov 13, 2015
 
 
The tender for a 0.84-hectare residential site with first storey commercial site at Alexandra View (pictured) in Redhill closed on Thursday after attracting 10 bids, said the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).
 
Launched for sale on 30 September 2015 under the confirmed list, the highest bid of $376.9 million was submitted by Tang Skyline, a subsidiary of Far East Consortium International, which translates to $9,158 per square metre on the gross floor area (psm/GFA). The lowest bidder was IOI Consolidated (Singapore) with a $250 million offer, or $6,075 psm/GFA.
 
The 99-year leasehold site is located next to Redhill MRT station and could yield around 400 housing units.
 
The future development is close to Tiong Bahru Plaza, Queensway Shopping Centre and IKEA Alexandra, as well as established schools.
 
The URA said a decision on the award of the tender will be made after the bids have been evaluated.

How to tell if a property has good potential for capital appreciation
Nov 13, 2015
 
 
Almost every real estate agent in a showflat will tell you the project has great potential for capital appreciation. This means you could make a good deal of money in the future after holding the property for a number of years. However, like former American president Richard Nixon said, “Trust, but verify.” Here are three tips for investigating a property’s potential.
 
1. Check the Masterplan
 
Our government is quite transparent with planning information, and most of it is publicly accessible. The latest revision to the URA Masterplan was in 2014, and details the changes planned for decentralized CBDs around Singapore, including Paya Lebar, Woodlands and Jurong. These changes suggest an influx of infrastructure, amenities and facilities that would definitely increase property prices in the area.
 
2. En-bloc potential
 
Those looking for properties that could potentially be en-bloc should look out for changes in plot-ratio in the Masterplan. This means that developers will be able to build more units on that piece of land than they previously could. Developers could make more money re-developing the land, and would therefore be interested to collectively buy over the units. Don’t restrict yourself to residential property for this — a lot of plot ratio changes are for both residential and commercial properties.
 
3. New transport links.
 
Our rail system has changed dramatically since the late ‘80s, with the first MRT trains. By 2030, the system is set to transform even further, with the planned Thomson-East Coast Line, Cross-Island Line, and the completion of construction for the Circle and Downtown lines. The convenience of train links will cause property prices to rise, so keep an eye on news of where upcoming stations will be located.

Upcoming launches in prized locations
By Feily Sofian, Esther Hoon | November 13, 2015 1:10 PM MYT
 
 
 
At least 25,000 units of private residential and executive condominiums will be looking for buyers over the next two years, on top of the existing launched but unsold stock in the market. Among them, several projects might pique prospective buyers looking for defensive assets.
 
We lined up upcoming projects located in the city fringe or near regional centres and close to an MRT station, which could hit the market in 4Q2015 and 2016. Notably, there are just a handful of them, amid the sea of projects expected to come onstream over the next two years. Prices are also likely to hold firm, based on the highest bids received for the land parcels.
 
 
 
Potong Pasir MRT station
 
MCC Land is expected to hold the preview for The Poiz Residences in mid-November. It is one of most anticipated projects, given its mixed-use development status and location right above the Potong Pasir MRT station on the city fringe. The project will offer 731 residential units and 84 retail units, named The Poiz Centre.
 
Tenders for the site attracted no less than 15 bids. MCC Land’s winning bid of $775 psf per plot ratio (ppr) could potentially translate into a competitive selling price for the project, which includes a retail component.
 
In June this year, a site for pure residential use near Braddell MRT station was sold to Evia Real Estate and its consortium for $755 psf ppr. Recently, a residential site on Lorong Lew Lian, some 400m from the Serangoon MRT station, drew a top bid of $710 psf ppr.
 
Based on all their new sale caveats, nearby projects such as Sant Ritz, Sennett Residence and The Venue Residences were transacted at an average price of $1,449 psf. Smaller units of between 500 and 700 sq ft changed hands at an average price of $1,539 psf, while those between 700 and 900 sq ft went for $1,458 psf on average.
 
On the rental front, nearby Nin Residence, which was completed in 2014, commanded an average monthly rent of $3.39 psf in 3Q2015. The project clocked 18 rental transactions during the period. Based on $3.39 psf rent and an expected selling price of $1,400 to $1,500 psf, the rental yield for new projects near Potong Pasir MRT station would range from 2.7% to 2.9%. While projects that are far from MRT stations may command higher rental yields owing to their smaller price tag, they are likely to take a longer time to rent out, while a higher yield is synonymous with higher risks.
 
 
 
Kovan MRT station
 
Asset Legend Ltd was awarded the site on Upper Serangoon Road in November 2014, beating 10 other developers. Located less than 300m from the Kovan MRT station, the site is zoned for residential use, with commercial units on the first storey. It will also offer 390 apartment units and five terrace houses. Given the tender award date, the project could potentially be launched in the first half of 2016.
 
Prices are also likely to be in the region of $1,400 to $1,500 psf. The average price for units at nearby projects — The Tembusu and Trilive — was $1,542 psf. Smaller units ranging from 500 to 700 sq ft were transacted at $1,569 psf on average, while bigger units of between 900 and 1,100 sq ft changed hands at $1,513 psf. However, both developments are freehold, which tend to command a premium of $50 to $100 psf over 99- year leasehold comparable projects.
 
Asset Legend paid $849 psf ppr for the site, which was the first to be affected by the new construction requirements, including a certain level of prefabricated components.
 
 
 
Lakeside MRT station
 
A stone’s throw from the Lakeside MRT station, Parcel B at Jurong West Street 41 was contested by nine bidders. MCL Land was awarded the site in March this year with its top bid of $630 psf ppr. Based on the tender award date, MCL Land might launch the project in 1H2016.
 
The breakeven price for the site is likely to be in the region of $1,050 to $1,100 psf, which potentially translates into a selling price of $1,200 to $1,300 psf. The site can yield an estimated 575 units, according to the URA, although MCL Land is reportedly planning to build close to 600 units, with one- and two- bedroom units accounting for about 60% of the project.
 
The makeover of the Jurong Lake Garden which fronts the project will add to its appeal. Construction of the west side of the garden is scheduled to start next year and complete in 2018. Ideas gathered during public consultation include cycling tracks and F&B outlets.
 
 
 
Braddell MRT station
 
The site at the junction of Lorong 6 and Lorong 4 Toa Payoh is about 500m from the Braddell MRT station. A consortium comprising Evia Real Estate, Greatearth and Gamuda Bhd was awarded the site in June this year, and this potentially leads to a launch date in the second half of 2016.
 
The consortium beat 13 other bidders for the site with its top bid of $755 psf ppr. The breakeven price for the project is expected to hover around $1,200 psf, which potentially translates into a selling price of between $1,400 and $1,500 psf. The project is expected to benefit from the dearth of new launches in the vicinity.
 
 
 
Queenstown MRT station
 
Another site on Dundee Road, next to the Queenstown MRT station, was awarded in June this year to HY Realty, whose shareholders own Hao Yuan Investment. HY Realty is reportedly planning to build a 700- unit condo and launch the project in the first half of 2016.
 
The site drew a total of nine bids, with a top bid of $871 psf ppr. The breakeven price of the project is estimated to be $1,300 psf, which translates into a potential selling price of between $1,500 and $1,600 psf.

Four Seasons Park at $2,748 psf
By Tay Hock Meng / The Edge Property | November 13, 2015 10:00 AM MYT
 
 
Four Seasons Park condo may be 21 years old, yet it is able to achieve the same price levels as newly completed luxury condos in the vicinity of Cuscaden Walk, Angullia Park and Tomlinson Road, located just off Orchard Boulevard. Last month, a 3,821 sq ft, six-bedroom unit on the 24th level of one of the three blocks was sold for $10.5million ($2,748 psf). That same unit fetched $6.8 million ($1,780 psf) in a sub-sale in 1995.
 
 
 
Two six-bedroom units on the 24th floor of two adjacent towers at Four Seasons Park sold four months
apart fetched identical prices of $10.5 million
 
 
 
In May, another six-bedroom unit of identical size with the same floor and unit number in a neighbouring block had also changed hands for $10.5 million, according to a caveat lodged then. Chandran VR, managing director of boutique real estate agency Cosmopolitan Real Estate, who was managing its tenancy on behalf of the previous owner, says the unit has a “premium view” of Orchard Road, the city skyline and, on a clear day, all the way to the Johor Straits.
 
As the previous owner had spent more than $1 million renovating and upgrading the unit three years ago, the original asking price was $13 million, adds Chandran. Nonetheless, at $10.5 million, the sale translated into a 69.4% capital upside for the previous owner, who had bought the unit for $6.2 million ($1,623 psf) 10 years ago. The seller is believed to be a foreigner.
 
Four Seasons Park contains 202 units in three 26-storey blocks sitting on a land area of 299,775 sq ft. Before Ardmore Park Condo was launched in 1996, Four Seasons Park was the standard-bearer for luxury condos. The project was developed by listed property group Hotel Properties Ltd, controlled by Singaporean tycoon Ong Beng Seng. It was launched in the early 1990s and completed in 1994. Even in 1995, units were sold at prices in the range of $1,600 to $1,700 psf.
 
Four Seasons Park is located across the road from Four Seasons Hotel, which is also owned by HPL. In fact, Four Seasons Park was the first hotel-branded residence in Singapore when it was launched. This was prior to the entry of a new generation of hotel-branded residences such as the 173-unit St Regis Residences (completed in 2008) and the 58-unit Ritz-Carlton Residences on Cairnhill Road (completed in 2013).
 
The appeal of Four Seasons Park lies in the size of its units, with the smallest being three-bedroom units starting from 2,260 sq ft. The four-bedroom ones range from 2,357 to 2,874 sq ft. There are none with five bedrooms, but the six-bedroom units are 3,821 sq ft and the penthouses are 6,017 sq ft.
 
However, like other luxury condos in Singapore, even Four Seasons has seen rentals erode owing to reduced expatriate budgets and increased competition from newer condos. Three years ago, its six-bedroom units could fetch a monthly rental of $25,000. Today, rents are in the range of $17,500 to $18,000, says Chandran.
 
Despite competition from newer luxury condos, Four Seasons Park is still sought after because of its location (it is a short walk to Orchard Road), spacious units and unblocked views, as well as extensive grounds of close to 300,000 sq ft. “It even has a winter garden— an air-conditioned glass conservatory within the grounds,” says Samuel Eyo, managing director of Singapore Christie’s Homes.
 
The only drawback is that because Four Seasons Park was built in the 1990s, it does not have private lift access to each unit, unlike most of the newer luxury condos. And owners will need to renovate the units. “If you renovate the unit well, you can command a good price, as seen in the recent transactions,”Eyo adds.
 
Next door to Four Seasons Park and fronting Tomlinson Road is the 70-unit Tomlinson Heights by HPL, completed in August last year. The luxury condo tower sits on a prime freehold site of 76,888 sq ft and contains a mix of spacious three-bedroom units sized from 2,540 sq ft, five-bedroom units from 4,004 sq ft and five-bedroom penthouses from 4,941 sq ft.
 
According to property agents, the developer has adjusted its selling price since the start of the year, and “the project is selling well”. Prices of units sold at Tomlinson Heights between May and July ranged from $2,680 to $2,915 psf, according to caveats lodged. However, owing to the unit sizes, the absolute prices have been high, with a 4,047 sq ft, five-bedroom unit on the fourth floor sold recently for $11 million ($2,718 psf), while a 2,745 sq ft, three-bedroom unit on the 23rd floor fetched $8 million ($2,915 psf), based on recent caveats.
 
This means the price levels at Tomlinson Heights are almost on a par with that of the two units sold at Four Seasons Park. “Some people may [choose] to buy a unit in a new luxury condo tower while others prefer the huge grounds of an older condo,” says Eyo. “It’s all a matter of personal choice, and buyers have quite a lot of choices today.”

​Wee Ee Chao’s daughter buys unit at Principal Garden
By Tay Hock Meng / The Edge Property, UOL Group Ltd | November 13, 2015 8:01 PM MYT
 
 
 
Wee Jun Ning, the daughter of Kheng Leong Co. CEO and board director Wee Ee Chao, purchased a 797 sq ft two-bedroom unit on the fifth floor of a premium block at Principal Garden for $1.295 million ($1,625 psf), according to an announcement by UOL Group on SGX. The purchase price was “on the basis of the same pricing offered to the public and no discount or preferential terms were accorded” to Wee’s daughter in her purchase.
 
Kheng Leong is UOL’s joint venture partner in the Principal Garden condominium at Prince Charles Crescent. While Kheng Leong holds a 30% stake, UOL owns the balance 70%.  The 663-unit Principal Garden was launched at the end of October, and sold 60% of 200 units at an average price of just above $1,600 psf.
 
Wee Ee Chao is also a director of UOL, and the son of Wee Cho Yaw, chairman and controlling shareholder of UOL, while brother Wee Ee Lim is deputy chairman.

DEAL WATCH: Reflections at Keppel Bay unit selling below 2015 low
By Tan Chee Yuen / The Edge Property | November 14, 2015 9:00 AM MYT
 
 
Prospective buyers aspiring to stay in an iconic waterfront development might consider this property. A 1,227 sq ft mid-floor unit at Reflections at Keppel Bay is listed on TheEdgeProperty.com for $1,850,000 or $1,508 psf. The Edge Fair Value, a valuation tool on TheEdgeProperty.com, puts the value of the property at slightly over $1,600 psf.
 
Reflections at Keppel Bay is a 99-year leasehold landmark condominium designed by Daniel Libeskind. Developed by Keppel Land, the project is located around 500m from Telok Blangah MRT station of the Circle Line. Some of the units in the project face Sentosa Island.
 
 
A 1,227 sq ft mid-floor unit at Reflections at Keppel Bay listed on
 
TheEdgeProperty.com for $1,850,000, or $1,508 psf
 
 
A total of nine units changed hands in the project this year. The lowest transacted price on per square foot basis this year was for a 1,313 sq ft unit on the ninth floor which was sold for $1,552 psf. The closest comparable transacted recently was a 1,248 sq ft unit on the 13th floor which found buyer at $1,618 psf in June 2014.
 
Average monthly rent of similar-sized two-bedroom units in the development stood at $6,022 or $4.82 psf. Based on the listing price of $1,508 psf, the $4.82 psf average rent translates to a potential gross rental yield of 3.8%.

Indeed, the top bid reflects confidence that prices during the launch will not be far from current levels, with the average selling price likely to be about $1,300 psf, said JLL national research director Ong Teck Hui.

Redhill site draws 10 bids

The tender for a 0.84-hectare residential site with first storey commercial site at Alexandra View (pictured) in Redhill closed on Thursday after attracting 10 bids, said the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).

http://sbr.com.sg/residential-property/news/why-did-sales-flop-wing-tais-crest
 
Why did sales flop at Wing Tai's The Crest?
 
Only 18% of units have been sold.
 
Deep in Singapore's Core Central Region (CCR) stands The Crest, a luxury residential development by homegrown developer Wing Tai. First launched late in 2013, The Crest has haunted by extremely poor sales, with only 18% of total units sold after several years in the market.
 
A report by RHB Research delved on the reasons behind The Crest's poor sales performance. The Crest's sales are particularly dismal when compared to sales of rival developments Alex Residences and Mon Jervois, which have sold 58% and 40% of units, respectively.
 
Although it is easy to blame poor market sentiment for The Crest's misfortune, RHB Research noted that units in the development are simply too big and too expensive for average buyers.
 
"More than half of the units were over 1,000 sq ft which could mean that they were too large and too expensive for home buyers. Thanks to the weak property market, homebuyers are becoming increasingly price-sensitive. In terms of price quantum, a 1,000 sq ft unit at The Crest would cost approximately SGD1.7m. In comparison, if most of the units were built at half the size, it would be more affordable for homebuyer," said the report.
 

 
I completely disagree with RHB
 
I don't think its too big, I think its just too expensive.
 
I have never heard anyone complain a 1000 sq feet apartment is too big.
 
To prove if I am right or wrong, if they halved the price I am sure they
 
will sell every unit. Its not size and price that is wrong, its just price that is wrong.

http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/property-management-news/2015/11/111612/mcc-land-opens-potong-pasir-condo-for-preview
 
MCC Land has opened The Poiz Residences for public preview, with sales set to begin on 28 November, reported The Straits Times.
 
Located beside Potong Pasir MRT station, the project had previously seen some unwelcome publicity, after several St Andrew’s alumni protested against its original name, The Andrew Residences, for being too similar to the name of the educational institution. MCC Land subsequently changed the name of the property.
 
Defying predictions of a further slowdown in the property market, the property developer is releasing about 50 percent of the total number of units in its first launch. The 731-unit condominium, situated in Meyappa Chettiar Road, forms part of a mixed-use development that also includes a retail and lifestyle mall, The Poiz Centre.
 
Over half its units are one- and two-bedders, measuring 420 sq ft and above and priced at around S$1,380 psf on average. The project will also feature 202 three-bedders, 52 four-bedders, and four penthouses. Both the mall and condominium are set to be completed in 2019.
 
“In spite of Potong Pasir’s rapid development over the years, it seems to lack an iconic central destination that combines major transport infrastructure with retail and recreational amenities, as found in most other residential estates,” said MCC Land managing director Tan Zhiyong. He noted that the commercial project is intended to be Potong Pasir’s definitive landmark.

DEAL WATCH: Apartment across from East Coast Park selling for $1,204 psf
By Tan Chee YUen / The Edge Property | November 21, 2015 10:00 AM MYT
 
 
East Coast Residences is a freehold apartment located on Upper East Coast Road, 500m across East Coast Park. An 872 sq ft unit in the project is listed on TheEdgeProperty.com for $1,050,000 or $1,204 psf. The Edge Fair Value, a valuation tool on TheEdgeProperty.com, puts the indicative value of the property at slightly below $1,300 psf.
 
East Coast Residences is a low density development comprising just 59 units. The project was developed by Crescendas Group and completed in 2011. Schools in the vicinity include Temasek Primary School and Temasek Junior College.
 
An 872 sq ft unit in the project is listed on TheEdgeProperty.com for $1.05 million, or $1,204 psf
 
The asking price of $1,050,000 or $1,204 psf is exactly the same as the last transaction involving another 872 sq ft unit in May 2012. In 3Q2015, the URA price index for private non-landed homes in Outside Central Region was still 5% higher than in 2Q2012.
 
In September 2011, another 872 sq ft unit found buyer at $1,246 psf. There was no transaction concluded in the project this year.  
 
Average monthly rent of similar-sized two-bedroom units in the development stood at $2,667 or $3,13 psf. Based on the listing price of $1,204 psf, the average rent translates to a potential gross rental yield of 3.1%.

MCC Land has opened The Poiz Residences for public preview, with sales set to begin on 28 November, reported The Straits Times.
 
Located beside Potong Pasir MRT station, the project had previously seen some unwelcome publicity, after several St Andrew’s alumni protested against its original name, The Andrew Residences, for being too similar to the name of the educational institution. MCC Land subsequently changed the name of the property.
 
Defying predictions of a further slowdown in the property market, the property developer is releasing about 50 percent of the total number of units in its first launch. The 731-unit condominium, situated in Meyappa Chettiar Road, forms part of a mixed-use development that also includes a retail and lifestyle mall, The Poiz Centre.
 
Over half its units are one- and two-bedders, measuring 420 sq ft and above and priced at around S$1,380 psf on average. The project will also feature 202 three-bedders, 52 four-bedders, and four penthouses. Both the mall and condominium are set to be completed in 2019.
 
“In spite of Potong Pasir’s rapid development over the years, it seems to lack an iconic central destination that combines major transport infrastructure with retail and recreational amenities, as found in most other residential estates,” said MCC Land managing director Tan Zhiyong. He noted that the commercial project is intended to be Potong Pasir’s definitive landmark.

In my experience, studio units should at least be 600sft in size for decent living.
I used to own the first loft unit in Singapore back in 2004/05. It was 638sft loft with 6m ceiling. 
 
Its great for bachelor , tight for a couple, ridiculous for a family with kid.

Should I buy or rent?
 
NOVEMBER 24, 2015 
 
A friend recently moved from one rented home to another. The family of four is still staying in a condominium in the east side of Singapore, but this time a better one – it is newer, bigger, and asking for lower rent too.
According to the latest SRX Rental Market Flash Report, rents for non-landed private rentals in October 2015 has fallen 5.7 percent from a year ago. Overall, rents are down 13.7 percent compared to its peak in January 2013.
 
 
How to consider buying or renting?
It is a never-ending debate whether one should buy or rent. It is very much an individual choice.
As I have mentioned in my book No B.S. Guide to Property Investment, the rent or buy decision is often influenced by four factors: age, lifestyle, finances and the property cycle.
 
 
Where is the buy-rent breakeven point?
If you are a foreigner in Singapore, your rent or buy decision can be based on a comparison on the total costs of the two options.
The buying option involves fixed and variable costs. The fixed costs of buying a home include initial downpayment, buyer stamp duties, legal fee, renovation, etc. Variable costs are housing mortgage, management fee, property tax, etc.
On the other hand, renting a place implies only the monthly rental.
In Zillow Talk: The Rules of Real Estate, the authors Spencer Rascoff and Stan Humphries introduced a concept called the “buy-rent breakeven horizon” – the number of years it would take to make buying economically preferable to renting the same home.
The breakeven point will depend on where you choose to stay and how long you are planning to stay there.
Let’s look at a real-life scenario. You are renting a 958 sq ft 2-bedroom unit at Amaryllis Ville at $4,200 per month. The market price of the unit is now $1,470,000. This is your first purchase and you can borrow 80 percent (or $1,176,000) from the bank.
Assuming that both management fee and rent increase at an annual rate of 1.8 percent (the average inflation rate in Singapore for the last 25 years). Interest rates and property taxes fluctuate depending on the market situation. So let’s use the current ones for the ease of calculations.
 
As you can see from the table, even if we are comparing only the total variable costs with the total rent, the buy-rent breakeven horizon falls between the 23rd and 24th year. In other words, it will take 24 years to make buying more economical compared with renting the same place.
Even after 30 years, the total fixed and variable costs of owning the 2-bedroom unit ($2.3 million for a Singaporean) is still higher than renting it for 30 years ($1.98 million).
Of course, compared with renting, you own the place after you pay back the bank. But there is also opportunity cost of the huge initial investment you put in to buy your home. Not to mention paying $482,067 in total interest to the bank over 30 years.
Property prices and rents can go up and down over the years. Perhaps the question should be when you can buy and when you should rent. Afterall, the key to win the property game is to buy at the right time with the right price. 
 
 
Why home purchase can’t be a rational decision?
For things that appeal to you emotionally, say, relationship or marriage, you don’t go for cost-benefit or breakeven analyses. You listen to your heart and make decisions based on what feels right. The same applies to buying a home.
It is the Asian culture to associate getting married with settling down and buying your own place. You need the abstract feeling of home or some call it the sense of belonging. Nothing beats coming back to the same place that is renovated to your own taste. One day when you retire, you can go back to a place that is fully paid for.
Singapore is a property-obsessed nation. The Singapore dream is to upgrade and stay in a condominium. As Rascoff and Humphries pointed out in the book,
“The upshot is that our homes are now much more than the places where we lay our heads at night. And they aren’t just where the heart is anymore, either. Homes are the object of our heart’s desire.”
You may be very sure that you won’t be wasting money to rent no matter what. But wait. There is one last thing that Rascoff and Humphries highlighted in their book that might change your mind: A US survey showed that tenants have higher weekly sexual activity compared with owners across all age groups until they reach the age of 60. No?

http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/property-management-news/2015/11/111612/mcc-land-opens-potong-pasir-condo-for-preview
 
 

http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/real-estate/poiz-residences-in-potong-pasir-may-be-launched-at-s1380-psf 
MCC Land (Singapore) managing director Tan Zhiyong said The Poiz Residences is priced attractively in reference to recent project launches and its breakeven price of around S$1,200 psf. The group has engaged ERA Realty and PropNex as the marketing agents of the residential project and CBRE for the retail component.
 
"We are hopeful of selling more than 40 per cent of the units we release during the launch weekend," he told The Business Times. Despite market concerns of a potential oversupply in the housing market and rising vacancies, Mr Tan said some buyers are just adopting a wait-and-see approach. "But the government has moderated the pace of land sales since 2013, while private housing demand has remained high."
 
To cater to the needs of both owner-occupiers and investors, The Poiz Residences has three distinct zones - hotel-like "Suites" suitable for renting out, "Urban" units for price-sensitive young professionals and "Habitat" units for families looking for bigger spaces. Some 65 per cent of the residential units are one and two-bedroom units ranging in area from 420 sq ft to 1,259 sq ft.
 
R'ST Research director Ong Kah Seng noted that more affluent HDB upgraders will consider Potong Pasir given its proximity to the city area while new retail amenities could re-energise the area.
 
"In the longer term, HDB flat owners who own a flat in Bidadari will also wish to upgrade within the vicinity, further supporting the future resale demand for private homes in Potong Pasir," he added. "Investors will find the rentability of homes here higher than those in north-eastern areas."
 
SLP International executive director Nicholas Mak noted that when the land parcel was launched in the first half of 2014, the government estimated some 685 residential units to be built on this site, which means each unit would be 809.6 sq ft of GFA on average. The developer has managed to generate 731 units from the allowable GFA, translating to an average 758.7 sq ft of GFA per unit.
 
He reckoned that leasing prospects for the project are positive given its retail amenities and proximity to Potong Pasir MRT and the new Bidadari housing estate. But he also said that there could be competition in the vicinity - 59 per cent of units in developments within 300 metres of the Potong Pasir MRT station are less than 90 sq m in area.
 
"In the near future, there would be at least two mixed residential-commercial developments near the Woodleigh MRT Station," Mr Mak said.

What an idiot.
The prediction of crash came in 2007 expecting 2008/2009 for most not so stupid investors.
When the crash came in 2009, the same not so stupid investors hv mostly moved in to buy one by Q1 2010.   
 
The same not so stupid investors hv taken some profit starting mid 2013 all the way into early 2014.
 
I think your buyer belongs to the really stupid group of investors, probably.

At least this one is a lot nearer to town and at almost same price as North Park Residence.  But North Park sold 313 units at launch and this one at a non ulu location sold just 260, it appears the market has weakened further since early 2015 or the bad press surrounding MCC is putting off some buyers.  
Heard One Canberra (unverified) which TOP recently also has lots of defects but I guess that is the norm these days.

http://themiddleground.sg/2015/12/06/independent-contractor-clause-thats-helping-property-developers-screw/
 
 
by Ryan Ong
 
PROPERTY developers have one job. This should mean that, if the house sucks, it’s pretty clear whose fault it is. In reality though, property developers can resort to something called the “independent contractor” clause. This deflects blame to one of the (possibly hundreds) of people who worked on your property. For comparison, that’s like your surgeon removing the wrong organ, and then telling you to sue the nurse because her bad handwriting caused it.
 
The Seaview case and your property
 
The hearing for The Seaview condominium case, which appeared in ST in July, has again been shifted to sometime in mid-2016. That means residents have been living with $32 million worth of defects for over five years. I imagine their developer meetings now begin with the careful removal of sharp objects.
 
The critical issue here is the “independent contractor” defence, which is being raised by Wheelock Properties:
 
“Developer Mer Vue Developments, a subsidiary of Wheelock Properties; main contractor Tiong Aik Construction; and RSP Architects Planners & Engineers are arguing that they had taken care to engage competent independent contractors to carry out the works, and so are not responsible for any faults.”
 
Claims that the developer is “not responsible”, so long as they engage independent contractors, should make your hair stand. If your property ends up being more Warcraft dungeon than luxury retreat, the developer can shrug and say it’s not their fault. The contractor did it.
 
Sadly, past cases have always accepted this defence. The Seaview trial is the first time the independent contractor defence is being challenged – and its outcome can significantly shift power back into the hands of property buyers.
 
How much can a developer get away with?

Got to "brand" them jialat jialat. 1600psf is very high even during the peak.
 
Their current project is Panorama. Hope they don't cut corners when they cut prices.
 
I think more protection for buyers is in place, like withhold the last 15% payment until the place is certified safe (for 5 years) by an independent reviewer. Wear and tear unavoidable but chips that cut or falling roof pieces are not.

Great observation.
 
One other odd thing is how those living in it could tolerate this kind of safety compromise. They take their stand by the legal channel rather than to sell their place. 
 
Maybe the year it was written? Note the project was completed in 2008. Maybe the writer meant that as of the moment, only units offered for sale at 1KPSF would garner interests?
 

Hmm, how come the article says that the owners bought at 1600 psf and are struggling to get 1000 psf now?
 
I checked URA and latest transactions are all around or above 1.6k psf.....

http://themiddleground.sg/2015/12/06/independent-contractor-clause-thats-helping-property-developers-screw/
 
 
by Ryan Ong
 
PROPERTY developers have one job. This should mean that, if the house sucks, it’s pretty clear whose fault it is. In reality though, property developers can resort to something called the “independent contractor” clause. This deflects blame to one of the (possibly hundreds) of people who worked on your property. For comparison, that’s like your surgeon removing the wrong organ, and then telling you to sue the nurse because her bad handwriting caused it.
 
The Seaview case and your property
 
The hearing for The Seaview condominium case, which appeared in ST in July, has again been shifted to sometime in mid-2016. That means residents have been living with $32 million worth of defects for over five years. I imagine their developer meetings now begin with the careful removal of sharp objects.
 
The critical issue here is the “independent contractor” defence, which is being raised by Wheelock Properties:
 
“Developer Mer Vue Developments, a subsidiary of Wheelock Properties; main contractor Tiong Aik Construction; and RSP Architects Planners & Engineers are arguing that they had taken care to engage competent independent contractors to carry out the works, and so are not responsible for any faults.”
 
Claims that the developer is “not responsible”, so long as they engage independent contractors, should make your hair stand. If your property ends up being more Warcraft dungeon than luxury retreat, the developer can shrug and say it’s not their fault. The contractor did it.
 
Sadly, past cases have always accepted this defence. The Seaview trial is the first time the independent contractor defence is being challenged – and its outcome can significantly shift power back into the hands of property buyers.
 
How much can a developer get away with?
 
......

 
The purchasers should be able to sue and claim recourse from the developer since they are both bound by contract. The developer shouldn't be able to deny responsibility.

The developer shouldn't be able to deny responsibility.They probably made tons of money selling at 1600 psf, wonder why they never go after main con but try to shift the blame to "independent contractor"? 
1600 psf get prime area now.  Paid so much, suffered for years and yet can't get out, sibei suay.

URA launches residential site in Clementi for sale
By Tay Hock Meng / The Edge Property, URA | October 23, 2015 7:06 PM MYT
 
 
 
URA has launched a 140,339 sq ft residential site at Clementi Avenue 1 for tender under the Confirmed List of the 2H2015 Government Land Sales (GLS) programme. The 99-year leasehold site has a maximum permissible gross floor area (GFA) of 491,189 sq ft, and can hold up to 460 residential units when fully completed.
 
Consultants like Nicholas Mak of SLP International says this site could attract developersâ interest due to its location, accessibility to Clementi Town and most importantly the absence of competition from new launches in the neighbourhood.
 
According to SLPâs Mak, there are three private condos nearby, one of which is the 956-year leasehold The Parc, where all 659 units are fully sold. The Parc was completed in 2010. Two other neighbouring projects, namely the 210-unit Waterfront @ Faber and the 755-unit Trilinq are both 99-year leasehold GLS sites purchased in 2013. Waterfront @ Faber has 57 unsold units as at end September with the latest median price achieved at $1,233 psf. Meanwhile, The Trilinq has 555 unsold units as at end September, with latest median price of $1,328 psf.
 
With just four condominium development sites launched in 2H2015 compared to five in 1H2015, Mak reckons the site could attract 10 to 16 bids, with top bids in the range of $314 million to $340 million ($639 to $692 psf per plot ratio).
 
The tender for the site at Clementi will close on December 9.
I guessed 500+ PSF, experts guessed 700+PSF. Highest bid is 615 PSF and next is just under 600PSF. I guessed 500+ PSF, experts guessed 700+PSF. Highest bid is 615 PSF and next is just under 600PSF.

I different. I real one. Put money where mouth is type.
Those are paper experts or with deep vested interest type.
When i do see a real turnaround or worthy reason to buy, i will.
And i will also share my views after putting my money where my mouth is.
 
Ultimately, whats most meaningful and respectable to me is not about giving floating opinions not backed by any actions. 
 
Those people who say market is going up, why are they still not buying and choosing to wait, wait wait?
If got no money, then sorry lah, dont stand by the baccarat table encouraging the gambler to bet.
The only people who do that are the croupiers, or in this case, property agents and related.
 
Drum drum drum, saying market up, bottomed out.
Our economy is currently on a downhill, are they blind?
We will be popping champagne if we dont see a recession in 2016, this i tell you.

JUST SOLD: Luxury condo unit in district 10 sold at $3,400 psf
By Tan Chee Yuen / The Edge Property | December 10, 2015 5:49 PM MYT
 
A 2,917 sq ft unit at Bishopsgate Residences was sold in November for $9.92 million, which worked out to be $3,400 psf. Earlier this year, another 6,082 sq ft unit changed hands for $21.08 million, or $3,465 psf in August.
 
Since 2013, home prices at Bishopsgate Residences have never fallen below $3,400 psf. According to URA, prices of high-end, non-landed homes have fallen 9% since the peak in 1Q2013 and have returned to 2010 levels.
 
A location scan of properties within 500m of Bishopsgate Residences shows that the project has set the ceiling for average home prices in the vicinity which started at $1,079.
 
Bishopsgate Residences is luxury condominium development in prime district 10. Completed in 2012, the freehold property is located within 500m from the upcoming Orchard Boulevard MRT station of Thomson East Coast Line.

Edge is the best, failed to disclose the peak price of $3,899 for a much larger unit.  ST toeing the govt line these days, so probably a lot more balanced.

I think the developer Singland and UOL really putting their money where their mouth is as well.
 
Even with the projected dip in costs for the next few years, the breakeven for this bid will come up minimally to about 1KPSF.
 
We will be looking at 460 units of average about 1067sf units.
 
Ultimate selling price per average sized unit will be starting about 1.2mil onwards unless they have a mix of smaller units and some huge ones... They really have confidence in this area / project.

MCC Land has opened The Poiz Residences for public preview, with sales set to begin on 28 November, reported The Straits Times.

Small town, big potential
Dec 11, 2015
 
 
Potong Pasir is among the smallest housing estates in Singapore, but it is not without its charm or potential. In recent years, a good number of condos have sprung up around the area, with the latest being right beside its MRT station. What can we expect from this little town?
 
Cheryl Marie Tay
 
Considered a mature estate in northeast Singapore under the Toa Payoh planning area, Potong Pasir is perhaps best known for being home to the St Andrew’s family of schools: St Andrew’s Junior School, St Andrew’s Secondary School and St Andrew’s Junior College.
 
It is also a stone’s throw from the now hotly contested Bidadari estate, which has been in the news of late thanks to its recent Build-to-Order (BTO) launches.
 
Furthermore, Potong Pasir’s relatively central location and well developed transport infrastructure allow quick and easy commute to the CBD and Orchard Road, with the PIE and CTE just a short drive away.
 
 
Over the years
 
Populated by numerous sand quarries and ponds between 1910 and 1937, Potong Pasir later became one of Singapore’s most prominent and successful vegetable-producing areas in the 1950s.
 
Still, it was a rural area with government-leased farmland, as well as low-quality roads; flooding was also a regular occurrence. But thanks to rapid development in the decades following the 1950s, it improved tremendously.
 
From bridges across the ponds and a village community centre where children could be educated in the 1950s to electricity and piped water in the 1960s, Potong Pasir underwent a massive transformation.
 
In the 1970s, government took over the land for redevelopment purposes, necessitating the relocation of the villagers. This eventually led to the public housing estate of Potong Pasir to be formed in the 1980s, resulting in the now iconic sloping rooftops of several of the HDB blocks there.
 
Despite all this development, however, Potong Pasir has managed to maintain the quaint, peaceful charm of a small neighbourhood, whose shops are mostly locally owned businesses that meet the needs of its residents.
 
 
A homely affair
 
More recently, after some controversy, The Poiz Residences and The Poiz Centre were finally launched. Initially named The Andrew Residences and The Andrew Village, complaints from some of the St Andrew’s alumni that the original names would detract from the schools’ rich history led the developer, MCC Land, to rename both the condominium project and its commercial building.
 
Though Potong Pasir consists mainly of HDB flats, there are a variety of private residential and mixed-use developments in and around the area. One of them is The Venue, a 99-year leasehold residential and commercial project at Tai Thong Crescent.
 
Wong Xian Yang, Senior Manager of Research & Consultancy at OrangeTee.com, says one of the selling points of The Venue is that it is “surrounded by good schools such as Cedar Primary (School), the St Andrew clusters and Maris Stella High School, which is a draw for parents with (school-going) kids”.
 
He adds: “Essentially, the most attractive selling point for mixed developments such as The Poiz Residences and The Venue is the convenience it brings. Their city fringe location and close proximity to transport infrastructures such as Potong Pasir MRT station and the PIE allow commuters to reach the CBD and Orchard Road without much hassle. This is particularly true for The Poiz Residences, as it is connected to the MRT station.”
 
The Poiz Residences is recently launched 99-year leasehold mixed-use development connected to Potong Pasir MRT station, and features 731 residential units and 84 commercial units in The Poiz Centre.
 
Wong says, “For now, MCC Land has not decided to sell the strata retail units of The Poiz Centre, and is choosing instead to lease out the units themselves. This arrangement would lead to better control over the tenant mix, and should create more value for the residents.”
 
 
 
Prospects and potential
 
Now that The Poiz Residences has been launched to enthusiastic response, with nearly 75 percent of its released units having been sold during its first weekend of sales alone, Potong Pasir will no doubt be more densely populated.
 
Some long-time residents may not welcome this change, but there is no denying that this bodes well for the property market in the estate, which has been doing rather well so far. Wong predicts: “Going forward, the population in the vicinity is set to increase with the completion of The Poiz Residences, The Venue, and the BTO projects in Bidadari estate, breathing more life into the currently quiet estate.
 
“The retail components in some of the aforementioned developments, together with the upcoming market square in Bidadari, will provide more variety in amenities for residents. Given its city fringe location, value is expected to hold up as the developments in the area can continue to command a premium price for the convenience and host of nearby amenities.
 
“In the long run, the build-up of the Bidadari estate may eventually increase the demand for private residential units nearby, as upgraders often prefer moving within the estate.”

They probably made tons of money selling at 1600 psf, wonder why they never go after main con but try to shift the blame to "independent contractor"?
 
1600 psf get prime area now. Paid so much, suffered for years and yet can't get out, sibei suay.

I don't think the Sea View was sold at 1600psf by the developer...
 
I recall being offered a unit way after their initial launch at their showflat for slightly $750+psf in 2006.

I also hate this change.
Potong pasir is a nice sleepy estate on its own.
Low density and not crowded.
Very comfy place.
Last time we play rugby there, still got so much greenery.
(Oops did i just reveal the school i was from?)
 
Now all these developments bringing in thousands of people to mess the open skies and block the views, jam the traffic, sibei tulan man.  Esoecially my friends in the landed estate nearby. Suddenly get towered by these condos staring at them.  Lost its quaintness and privacy....
 
Most suay is the traffic. After years of digging twisting turning, they completed the tonnel and the connecting roads making traffic smooth again.  Knn, now with bindadari, and all the freaking condos, its gonna bring the traffic down again.

From homes to hotels
Dec 11, 2015
 
With tenants harder to come by, landlords are turning to tourists for investment income. How do the numbers work out? We give you the Guru View.
 
By Chang Hui Chew
 
Short term rentals, defined as leases below six months in length, are technically illegal. While the Urban Redevelopment Authority is currently re-examining its short term lease policy, many homeowners have already started renting out their properties to tourists using services like Airbnb and Tujia. More often than not, residential homes have taken over the roles of hotels, and are providing tourists a place of lodging during their travels.
 
There are a number of push and pull factors that have led homeowners to adopt this model, rather than staying with traditional one- or two-year leases to longer term tenants. For the purpose of analysis, we will only be looking at private non-landed residential homes, which a quick survey of Airbnb and Tujia reveal, is the majority of the short term properties available for lease here.
 
Tenants Versus Tourists
 
Sentiment in the real estate market is in the doldrums currently, with the private non-residential rental segment taking a hit as well. Figure 1 shows the movement of rental volumes over the past 12 quarters in a general upward direction. This is deceptively positive. While this does indicates tenant demand, the situation is a little more complex.
 
gtgv3
 
Even as rental volumes have increased, so too has the vacancy rate (Figure 1, right-hand side axis). In Q2 2015, the vacancy rate for non-landed private residential homes reached a record 9.2 percent, before dipping slightly to 9.1 percent in the last quarter. What these two data points suggest is that existing demand, while at a relatively high level, is unable to absorb the supply coming on stream.
 
On the ground, we are also hearing that a number of condominium units that sold exceeding well due to their investment potential three or four years ago are now facing stiff competition for tenants, with landlords in a race to the bottom dollar to secure agreements. The supply side situation is likely to exacerbate further in 2016, with over 20,000 more private non-landed residential units set to complete construction.
 
Furthermore, the prognosis for the rental market is far from rosy. A slowing global economy does not bode well for trade in exports reliant Singapore, and it is unlikely we will see an increase in companies setting up their regional headquarters here. This would also imply a slowdown in the arrival of expatriates and their families, which would lead to a weakening of demand for rental units.
 
Given this, savvy landlords began to turn to another population other than tenants to occupy their empty units, with tourists stepping in to fill the gaps. We compiled Singapore Tourism Board’s (STB) international tourist arrivals in Singapore over the past 18 quarters. Figures have remained consistently above the 3 million level each quarter, and just crossed 4 million in the third quarter of this year (Figure 2), the quarter we traditionally see arrival peaks each year.

The consistency of tourist arrivals, enabled by disruptive Internet services, provides landlords a solution to monetize the excess capacity available, without the high operational costs and risks a hotel operator would face. Using these services, landlords are able to charge less per night than a regular hotel, undercutting them in price, while promising a more authentic experience.
 
Furthermore, switching to this model also cuts out the real estate agent, which saves on commission charges for landlords. However, there are other costs involved with this model as well, with both Airbnb and Tujia charging a service fees. Landlords would probably need to pay more in maintenance with more wear and tear, and cleaning costs associated with shorter-term rentals.
 
Yielding More
 
One of the attractions of switching to this model, even if landlords were able to find long-term tenants easily, is the promise of higher rental yields. Let’s run some numbers and see if this bears out.
 
Let’s take a hypothetical 800-sq ft, two-bedroom residential apartment bought at $1M. If the homeowner were to fully qualify for the maximum loan-to-value ratio (LTV) and loan tenure, the loan amount would be $800,000 over a 30-year mortgage. We will assume an interest rate of 1.2 percent. According to PropertyGuru’s mortgage repayment calculator, this will work out to be a monthly payment of $2,647 a month.  We will also assume a monthly maintenance of about $453 on the condo unit as well, which brings the total expected monthly outlay to $3,100.
 
Regular one-year lease
 
At the current median rental price of $3.45 per square foot per month, the homeowner can ask for a market rate of about $2,760 per month. While on paper, gross rental yields would work out to be about 3.3 percent per annum, in real terms, the homeowner would be paying $4,080 each year out of pocket. On top of this, the homeowner would also have paid his / her real estate agent a standard one month’s commission of $2,760 as well, bringing the total annual outlay to $6,840 per year.
 
If the homeowner wants to avoid having negative cash flow each month, and asks for $3,100 in rents, the tenant would be paying $3.88 per square foot per month, 12 percent above the current median. This is not necessarily unattainable, especially if the unit is newer, and in a good location. This rate will not cover the agent’s commission either, which the homeowner will continue to pay out of pocket.
 
Short term rentals
 
Airbnb estimates that homeowners in Singapore can earn about $1,882 per week if they were to rent out their entire apartment to a maximum of four guests, or about $268 per night. If we assume that the apartment was only occupied for half the month, or 15 days out of 30, the rental income after Airbnb’s three percent service fee is about $3,912. The gross annual yield hence would be about 4.7 percent, and the homeowner would receive a passive income of $812 per month. Even if the homeowner were to incur an extra $100 per week for cleaning and maintenance charges, there would still be a positive cash flow of $412.
 
Beyond the Numbers
 
Just looking at the numbers, short term rentals can provide better yields than regular long term leases. However, the homeowner will also take on more risk by choosing this particular model for investment income. While Airbnb does provide a $1.2M guarantee for loss and damages to homeowners, it will not cover wear and tear, which is likely to be higher with a short-term rental model. Furthermore, tourism arrivals are seasonal, and there is no guarantee of a consistent occupancy rate of even 50 percent throughout the year. Homeowners might, therefore, need a certain degree of reserves to tide them through the lull months instead of counting on rental income.
 
Not every particular private property can use the short term rental model successfully as well. While tourists might arrive in Singapore by the millions per quarter, they are unlikely to want to stay in further flung suburban areas with longer commutes to tourist attractions and shopping destinations. Most of the properties available on Airbnb currently are either within the city core, or interesting city fringe areas, like Marine Parade, Geylang and Tiong Bahru.
 
While the shortterm rental model could be a viable alternative for homeowners to earn some investment income in a weak rental market, it is very clear that what makes a home attractive to long term tenants, i.e., proximity to transportation, amenities, and the city center, are the same factors that would make them successful long term rentals. However, homeowners and landlords do need to keep in mind that this is still technically illegal, and they could face legal consequences if caught.

I don't think the Sea View was sold at 1600psf by the developer...
 
I recall being offered a unit way after their initial launch at their showflat for slightly $750+psf in 2006.

You are right, $1600 psf can't be right given the project TOP 5 years ago.
 
Did you take up the offer?

I did not.
 
With hindsight, bangballs.
 
But at that time, my thinking was don't assume my salary will keep rising and don't wear too big a hat. (Keep in mind that The Sail was launched a little later at 900+psf and people were saying it's too high and Kwek wife bought a unit herself).
 
Then again, I might be cursing and swearing now. Buying into such a unit for self stay is not the same as for rental income.

Alexis ‘shoebox’ appeal sustained
By Tay Hock Meng / The Edge Property | December 11, 2015 10:00 AM MYT
 
Alexis — one of the first and biggest shoebox developments, with 293 residential units sitting on top of 21 strata shops — was completed in 2012. When it was launched in 2009, all the units were snapped up within the first weekend of preview. The project was developed jointly by Yi Kai Group and Fission Group and its successful launch was the catalyst that sparked a wave of shoebox units in mixed-use developments.
 
A freehold development, Alexis contains a mix of one- and two-bedroom units. The one-bedroom units measure 366 to 527 sq ft; one-bedroom-plus-study units measure 474 to 764 sq ft. Meanwhile, two-bedroom units are from 527 to 1,033 sq ft while two-bedroom-plus-study units are from 657 to 1,055 sq ft. There are also penthouses which are sized from 764 to 1,518 sq ft. Prices back then averaged $1,046 psf.
 
 
All 21 shops at Alexis are leased now, and the one-bedroom units continue to draw
investors with its still-attractive gross yield of about 4%
 
 
From January to October this year, seven apartments at Alexis have changed hands, compared with just five last year and 10 in 2013, based on caveats lodged. Those who bought their apartments when the development was launched six years ago and sold them at today’s prices can still see a significant upside.
 
This was evident in the most recent transaction: A 398 sq ft, one-bedroom unit on the fifth floor changed hands for $700,000 ($1,758 psf), according to a caveat lodged with URA Realis on Oct 26. The sale price was 53% higher than the original purchase price of $458,000 ($1,150 psf), which the seller paid in 2009.
 
One-bedroom units at Alexis can still command monthly rental rates of $2,500, says Spencer Ng, senior marketing director at ERA Realty Network. “The small units at Alexis remain attractive because the rents are more than enough to cover the investors’ monthly loan repayments even at today’s prices,” he explains.
 
Based on a monthly rental rate of $2,500, the buyer of the one-bedroom unit for $700,000 will have a gross rental yield of 4.2%. Assuming the buyer is an investor and it is his second property, the borrowing limit is 50%, or $350,000. Based on an interest rate of 1.5% and a 30-year loan period, Ng estimates that the monthly mortgage payment translates into $1,208.Thus, the monthly rental rate of $2,500 is enough to cover the mortgage and other expenses as well as earn an income for the investor, he adds.
 
Ng brokered the two recent transactions at Alexis in August and September as well. Both were also one-bedroom units. The unit sold in September was a 388 sq ft, third-floor unit and it fetched $740,000 ($1,910 psf). The previous owner had purchased it in a sub-sale for $605,000 ($1,561 psf),thus seeing a 22.3% capital appreciation. The one sold in August was a 420 sq ft unit that went for $700,000 ($1,667 psf). The previous owner paid $643,000 ($1,532 psf) for the unit in a sub-sale, thus his gain was 8.9%.
 
While the residential units have been able to attract tenants, the 21 shop units on the first floor have had a harder time filling up. After a slow start, all the shop units have now been leased, with rental rates ranging from $8 to $9 psf per month, according to marketing agents.
 
There have also been fewer shop units changing hands at Alexis. The most recent transaction was that of a 258 sq ft unit, which was sold for $1.15 million ($4,452 psf) in August. The seller suffered a 10.9% loss, as he had paid $1.3 million ($4,794 psf) for the unit in a sub-sale in 2012.
 
“Investors of the residential units at Alexis are able to realise their returns immediately,” says Donald Han, managing director of Chestertons Singapore. “The units at Alexis are also freehold, compared with the new launches in the Alexandra area, which are 99-year leasehold, such as Alex Residences, Commonwealth Tower and Principal Garden.”

Who doesnt know that any stupid Developments launched in 2009 were fully sold and will still hv a profit today.
 
Read the report further and you will find that units bought in 2012 and later had the profits greatly thinned out, even suffering losses.
 
Good luck to the buyer today.....muayhahahahah
 
 
Anyone can show me a condo bought in 2014 making a profit today, i can probably name you 10 others that are not

The impact of MRT on property prices
By Feily Sofian, Esther Hoon | December 11, 2015 11:25 AM MYT
 
 
Bukit Panjang residents will soon enjoy a shorter commuting time to town when Singapore’s latest MRT line, the Downtown Line 2 (DTL2), commences operations on Dec 27. Most people take for granted that a property with good accessibility would command a higher value. The idea originated from Johann Heinrich von Thünen, a 19th century economist, who theorised that a farmer’s profit from his farmland would partially depend on his transportation costs to the market, where buyers and sellers exchange goods.
 
Inspired by von Thünen, city planner and economist William Alonso proposed in the 1960s that land near the city centre, where jobs and entertainment are located, would command higher rents. His reasoning was simple — residents living close to the city centre can save on transportation costs, including the opportunity costs of commuting such as a loss in leisure and money-making opportunities. While technology has significantly lowered transportation expenses for firms and individuals, the opportunity costs of commuting are still very relevant today.
 
By virtue of this, the opening of the DTL2 stations would boost the prices of nearby properties. However, some speculated that the upside in property prices would kick in when the government first unveiled the station locations and no further upside is expected when the new MRT line is completed. Others suggested that another round of price upside would ensue shortly before the new MRT line commenced operations.
 
 
 
Smaller HDB flats reaped the most benefits
 
A study by The Edge Property shows a widening price gap over the years between HDB flats located within 500m of Bukit Panjang MRT station and those located more than 500m from the station. The price gap became glaring in 2014 and 2015 as the opening of the DTL2 stations drew closer, with four- and five-room HDB flats within walking distance of Bukit Panjang station commanding more than a 20% price premium over those that were not.
 
The study also suggests that smaller HDB flats benefited the most from the proximity to the stations. Four-room flats near Bukit Panjang station commanded an estimated price premium of 15% in 2010 and 2011 and 17% in 2012 and 2013. The price premium spiked to 24% in 2014 and 2015 (see Chart 1 on next page). In the meantime, the price gap for five-room flats widened from around 14% between 2010 and 2013 to 22% in 2014 and 2015 (see Chart 2).
 
Quantum-wise, four- and five-room flats within 500m of Bukit Panjang station fetched an average price of $461,000 and $577,000 respectively in 2015. Those located more than 500m from the station changed hands at an average price of $372,000 and $475,000 respectively.
 
HDB flats located near Bukit Panjang station were not spared the bearish market sentiment but prices have generally been more resilient than those further from the station. For example, prices of four-room flats located within 500m of Bukit Panjang station fell 10% from an average of $511,000 in 2013, to $461,000 in 2015 while those of five-room flats fell 5% from $607,000 to $577,000. On the other hand, HDB blocks located more than 500m from Bukit Panjang station witnessed a steeper price decline over the same period, averaging 15% to $372,000 for four-room flats and 12% to $475,000 for five-room flats.
 
There is some evidence of an increasing price premium for executive HDB flats located near Bukit Panjang station, but it is less pronounced than four- and five-room flats. Residents living in smaller flats are likely to be more dependent on public transportation, which explains the jump in price premium towards the opening of the station. Based on historical resale statistics, there is no three-room flat within 500m of Bukit Panjang station.
 
 
 
Mixed impact on private homes
 
The impact of the DTL2 stations on private home prices is harder to quantify due to the limited number of transactions and the heterogeneity of the projects in terms of tenure, age, unit size and facilities. Notwithstanding that, anecdotal evidence shows similarly resilient prices for new projects located near MRT stations.
 
For example, a 1,206 sq ft low-floor unit at Espa, a 999-year leasehold condominium located next to Cashew station, fetched $1,101 psf in May this year. The price reflects a 35% gain for the owner, who purchased the unit at $813 psf in May 2012, and bucks the trend of falling property prices. Espa was completed in 2009.
 
At The Tennery, a 99-year leasehold apartment located just 252m from Bukit Panjang station, a 614 sq ft unit on the sixth floor was sold at $1,252 psf this year. In 2013, three similar-sized units on the seventh and eighth floors were transacted at an average price of $1,280 psf. The 2015 transaction reflects a modest price decline of 2% from 2013. In comparison, the overall mass-market non-landed home prices have declined by 7% since 3Q2013’s peak. The Tennery was completed in 2014.
 
Older condominiums, however, did not perform as well despite their proximity to the DTL2 stations. However, their price decline was comparable to new projects located further from the stations. Proximity to MRT stations seems to compensate for the age of the projects. For analysis, we compare prices in 2015 and 2013 when the market was at its peak. At Glendale Park, a freehold condominium located 244m from Hillview station, three 1,206 sq ft units on the ninth floor changed hands at an average price of $1,004 psf this year. The price represents a decline of about 14% from 2013, when a 1,033 sq ft unit on the eighth floor was sold for $1,161 psf. Glendale Park was completed in 2000.
 
Comparable-size units at Hillvista, a newer freehold condominium completed in 2010 and located 522m from Hillview station, witnessed a similar drop. A 1,292 sq ft unit on a low floor was sold at $1,188 psf this year. In 2013, a 1,152 sq ft unit, also on a low floor, went for $1,389 psf. Historically, 1,152 sq ft and 1,292 sq ft units in the development fetched similar per square foot prices.
 
In another example, an 807 sq ft unit on the 16th floor of Maysprings, a 99-year leasehold apartment located 401m from Bukit Panjang station, was transacted at $929 psf this year. The price reflects a 7% decline from 2013 when two similar-sized units on the 13th and 14th floor found buyers at an average price of $997 psf. Maysprings was completed in 1998.
 
Some 2km from Bukit Panjang station, a 667 sq ft unit on the 16th floor of Foresque Residences changed hands at $1,259 psf this year. In 2013, a 732 sq ft unit on the 18th floor was sold for $1,354 psf. The 2015 transaction reflects a 7% price decline, similar to the Maysprings transaction. Maysprings is about 16 years older than Foresque Residences.
 
 
 
A unit at Espa, a condominium next to Cashew station, was sold at $1,101 psf this year, reflecting a 35% price gain since 2012

Before anyone goes about talking about 30% profit, 40% profit or whatever profit simply taking psf now and then, please take note that the stamp duties may wipe out a fair bit of the profit.
 
Of course there are also rent and interest considerations to P/L but thats very case to case so its acceptable that we dont bring that into the equation
 
Therefore if a foreigner had bought at $1000psf and sold within a year at $1300psf, he would effectively have lost money and not made 30% gain.
 
Be aware how people present their reports to swing information one way.

Red House project sells majority of units
Dec 11, 2015
 
 
The Red House project in the Katong area has seen over two-thirds of its units sold amid a slowdown in the private property market, reported Channel NewsAsia.
 
Considered an iconic landmark, the Red House was once a famous bakery, but is now being developed into a residential-retail lifestyle development by Warees Investments, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore’s (MUIS) property arm.
 
Launched in 2013, the project is on track for completion by Q2 2016, said Warees Investments.
 
It will have 42 residential units that are categorised into three classes – Residences (28 units), Suites (10 units) and Lofts (four units) – with unit sizes ranging from 441 sq ft to 1,206 sq ft.
 
“Construction for the development which includes the iconic Red House in Katong is currently at 90 percent completion,” the developer noted.
 
Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim was briefed on the progress of the project during his visit to the development site on Thursday.
 
Commenting on how the development will enhance the heritage of Joo Chiat and Katong, Dr Yaacob said: “This is a conserved building. We are able to maintain the facade and as the architect explained, they work painstakingly to restore the frontage of the building which I think is very important.
 
“The Red House of course is another icon, so I think we have done our part to make sure that the heritage of Joo Chiat and Katong is maintained.”
 
Notably, five adjacent shophouses at 63, 65, 67, 69 and 71 East Coast Road, as well as the Red House at 75 East Coast Road were declared as Wakaf (Islamic endowment) assets in 1957.
 
To “relive the good days of Katong and preserve the character and heritage of the district”, a bakery will reopen at the Red House building, added Warees Investments.
 
Aside from selling bread, the bakery will also feature a gallery as a tribute to the building’s heritage. The developer is currently looking at ways on how it can allow the public to access the gallery round-the-clock.

Looking for more resilient residential properties
By Tan Kok Keong / REMS Advisors, The Edge Property | December 14, 2015 10:00 AM MYT
 
The latest indicators of Singapore’s private residential property market do not make happy reading for owners of existing properties. The non-landed Private Residential Property Price Index (PRPPI) has registered a decline for eight consecutive quarters since 3Q2013 (see Chart 1). Since 1995, the Singapore private residential property market has undergone three down cycles: from the 2Q1996 to 4Q1998, from 2Q2000to 2Q2004, and from 2Q2008 to 2Q2009 (see Chart 1). Our view is that the market is some distance away from reaching a bottom, with weak market sentiment and rising unsold inventory being a drag on property transactions being realised.
 
Identifying resilient planning areas
 
As evidenced in the past few months, however, there is still enough interest and liquidity in the market to suggest that potential buyers are still on the hunt for “investible” properties for medium- to long-term hold. In the current cycle, we believe purchasers might want to focus on identifying properties that are more resilient to protect their capital investment. In this article, we share a concise version of our analysis of the resale prices of non-landed private residential properties for each of the down-cycles to identify planning areas in which prices were more resilient.
 
 
 
Top 10 most resilient planning areas in Singapore
 
Extracting data from the REALIS database provided by URA, we analysed the magnitude of the decline in median resale prices of the non-landed private residential properties for each planning areas from the peak to the trough for each of the past down-cycles. Next, we ranked the planning area with the least price decline to the most; the planning area with the least decline can be deemed to be the most resilient. This way of analysing the market trend can provide investors with a reference point from which to start to look for properties in the current climate.
 
Based on this analysis, we identified the 10 best-performing planning areas in each property cycle in the past 20 years (see Chart 2). Out of 55 planning areas in Singapore, several planning areas have clearly and consistently performed better than others. They are Geylang, Toa Payoh, Ang Mo Kio, Clementi, Hougang, Jurong West, Kallang, Orchard, Rochor and Yishun, which appeared at least twice in the top 10 lists in each property down-cycle (see Chart 3).
 
Sustainable rental yield of properties within the city fringe area
 
Among these 10 planning areas, property prices in Geylang and Toa Payoh have shown the most resilience, appearing three times in the top 10 lists for the past four cycles (including the current one). The value resilience in these two planning areas could be partly due to their relatively well established residential enclaves, with excellent connectivity to the city centre and an abundance of amenities, while the growth of rental and prices largely remained in sync with fundamentals.
 
In fact, if we analysed the gross rental yield of non-landed private residential properties within Rest of Central Region (RCR), or the city fringe area, Geylang Planning Area has demonstrated sustainable rental yield throughout the last three peak-to-trough cycles (see Chart 4). The resilience in rental yield of Geylang residential properties was most apparent since 2008, where it consistently ranks second. Other RCR areas that exhibited similar resilience was the Queenstown Planning Area and Bukit Merah Planning Area.
 
While there are numerous other factors that should be taken into account in your property investment, what we propose here is a high-level method of filtering investment opportunities. You can and should consider other attributes of the planning area and determine whether you agree with what the data shows.
 
 
 
Catalysts for change in values
 
In addition to looking for resilience in prices, potential buyers of non-landed private residential properties might want to consider the catalysts in locations that could spur the growth of prices of properties beyond the market norm. A good way to gauge this is to study the government’s development plans. Over the past years, successive efforts by the government to decentralise has resulted in a boost in property prices in Tampines Regional Centre, Jurong Lake District and Novena Fringe Centre. The government is looking to boost the development of the Woodlands Regional Centre, Jurong Lake District, North Coast Innovation Corridor, Paya Lebar Central, among others, in coming years. Typically, such localities will see the government’s efforts to improve the connectivity of public transports and expressways, and the injection of commercial spaces to create employment and retail spaces, which tend to lift up private residential property prices in these areas once it matures.
 
 
 
Look for value resilience and catalysts for change
 
In conclusion, our hypothesis is that investors looking for property purchases at this point of the cycle should look for localities in which property prices have demonstrated more resilience over the past cycles and with bigger upside potential from government initiatives to enhance the live-work-play element of the location.

The rise in new home sales last month shows the market's resilience, but buyers still need to be lured by well-located developments at attractive prices, said analysts.

No matter what, supply is very high and sellers are stuck with huge "inventory"
Simple economics will tell you where the market is headed.
No need for any bullcrap one sided analysts and their reports.
 
Bottomline, price not reduced, units cant sell.  
Price reduced, units start to move naturally.
 
*yawn* 
 
Wake me up when there is a real change in fundamentals.

City fringe condos dominate November home sales
 
RCR homes accounted for over 60% of deals.
 
Residential developments in the Rest of Central region witnessed extremely brisk sales in November, driven by the launch The Poiz Residences in Potong Pasir.
 
The Poiz Residences accounted for 36% of sales last month, after selling 277 units at an average price of $1,440 psf.
 
According to OrangeTee Research, the majority or 84.6% of the units launched in November were located in the RCR. A total of 504 projects were sold in the region.
 
The five top-selling projects were all located in the RCR, namely The Poiz Residences, Sky Vue, Principal Garden, Sims Urban Oasis, and Thomson Impressions.
 
“The encouraging sales performance of The Poiz Residence is evidence that smallish affordable units continue to remain in favour with buyers’ demand. With the market heading into uncertain waters coupled with the large volumes of impending completions, mixed developments near a transport infrastructure and/or better located projects, have seen better demand due to their higher ‘rentability’. Other projects which do not have such favourable attributes may have to create a niche to level the playing field,” OrangeTee said.

Looking at past records and fundamentals in the last two years, projects which come out strong sell about 3qtrs of the units they launch at first try.  
On second try thereafter, they all sell drips and draps.
So POIZ has had its best shot.  Lets see how many more they sell hereon.
Heee hee hee
