Grey color is 3 way junction with big pipe in, 2 small pipes out.

Red is 2 way junction with small pipe in and small pipe out.
 

Brown is 3 way junction with big pipe in, 1 big pipe and 1 small pipe out.

Green is 2 way junction with big pipe in and small pipe out.
 
 


 

The question is at the thick pipe on the left.
 

Both A and B are shower heads.
 

I need to know if both shower at the same time, which layout is better? As in the water won't be so little.
 

Thanks for the help.

if you want pressure put small hole dia washer inside shower head for strong spray effect.

i think that the 1st layout will be better, pressure from bigger to smaller piper will be higher but the volume of water not necessary higher. But better jetting effects.
 

the 2nd layout will result in lower pressure somethings just like flowing down instead of gushing .

But also note that the distance of the pipe from source also plays a part.
 

think that this theory is the same as those in the high pressure water jet machines.

2nd option.More run length of  bigger diameter pipes.plan for less bends

If incoming pressure and flow are weak, that will be a bigger problem.

Use software like pipe flow wizard to help you calculate the head loss lah. Your design goal is to minimise head loss and minimise material cost.

Option 2 is better. This also serve a bigger manifold for your water flow before smaller outlet.

If you're staying in HDB, one inch pipe is good enough. 

Else, 2-3 inch pipe for landed property since the pipe run is long.

For shower head, currently all come with orifice to produce strong spray effect but uses less water.

Just the same as water jet for washing car and floor. It uses very little water. This is "science"

Option 2 will give a bigger vol of water = bigger mass = higher P

Hmm..if im experiencing quite weak water pressure currently how do I increase the water pressure?
 

House juz undergone 100% reno like 2 years ago....unhappy with the pressure on shower head in the bath room, currently using storage heater.

pressure low, try inlet & outlet with narrow washer and change shower head with needle holes.

Are you using the storage heater? if yes this problem also quite normal. i am also having this problem.

if 2 bathing at the same time surely there will be pressure drop, even if you change to small holes shower head the volume of water coming out also little.

unless you just want the jetting effect.

my family also take turns, but if one side does not want hot water the pressure will be better.

The volume of water is determined by the flow rate ie controlled by the main tap. Changing the size of the pipe changes the pressure nia

I think option 1 is better.

Pressure reduces when velocity increase.

After reading all the replies, I have decided to go for option 1.
 

The big pipe coming from the common toilet  to the masterbedrm toilet will end at the basin level, after that will use small pipe. 
 

A + B <or= Input (which another bro in another forum said). I think this is better for both shower points as the water volume will be shared from the big pipe, rather than sharing from 1 small pipe.
 

Also big pipe running along the floor will be quite unsightly.
 

Any improvement for my layout?
 

Thanks.

Neutrino is correct. oI'd go with option 2. 
 

Reason being that HDB/Condos uses gravity feed with tanks on roof. Reducing the pipe size along the line does not increase the pressure significantly contrary to popular belief. Pressure along whole pipeline stays the same and the outlet size determines the pressure drop along the existing line. Water volume increases and pressure can be adjusted by your outlet size(venture effect).
 

For maximum effect, try to get as short lengths(friction loss) of pipe with as little bends(hammering + pressure pool) as possible.

With regards to low water pressure.. anyone here consider installing such a device?
 

http://www.svb24.com/jabsco+steel+accumula...ank.html?lang=1
 

is commonly found in boats.. to maintain pressure in times of high usage.

During lull period, the pump will fill the tank to preset pressure. During high usage, the compressed nitrogen will ensure a consistent pressure downstream.
 

Have seen those huge blue tanks on top of buildings, but those are meant for reducing water hammer.
 

Got house version of such a device?

Plumber will have certain guidelines/ codes of practice to follow. Otherwise neighbors with smaller pipes would be disadvantaged by home owners with bigger pipes.

I wud prefer e option on e right.
 

Larger dia pipe means more water can flow so e 2nd shower sud get good pressure too.
 

Small dia pipe restricts flowrate n end up lower pressure.

In fact to get equal flowrate to both showers if both on at same time...a small dia pipe or a restrictive washer wh hole cud b placed fr e 1st shower to slightly restrict flowrate to it so 2nd shower wil get beter flowrate to compensate fr longer distance water needs to travel to 2nd shower.
 

Longer distance increases e restriction n reduces flowrate.

If yrs is landed then u can consider install a booster pump to maintain a set psi when more taps r open.
 

Or install a overhead storage tank to increase pressure n act as a resevoir when more taps r on.

This wil not increase flowrate. In fact it wil decrease flowrate. 
 

It only gives a stronger jet of water out of showerhead n only give impression of better jetting.

One point worth considering is that HDB do put a flow/pressure reducing thingme into the shower outlets.
 

Easy to unscrew and remove and certainly improves water flow. 
 

It may be illegal to do that though????
 

Our ID told us about it.



 
 

My blk a couple of yrs back ty send letter ask if we wan to put thimble to reduce water pressure.
 

I say dun wan but those koteks still put n my water pressure drop. :angry: 
 

Thimble put at water meter so i cannot diy remove.  :angry:

agreed it dont increase pressure, at least a pulsating feeling is good to wash down your soap effectlively rather than having weak output flow.

Consider using rain shower head [installed overhead near to ceiling], because the water will drop down vertically. The feeling is different.

* btw, I saw some promoters selling so called "rain shower" which attach to wall with suction cup. I don't think these are really rain shower.

this dont works on instant heater.rain shower really needs powerful pressure

Rain shower u need a good flowrate otherwise water just trickle wil b rain drizzle only. Take very long to shower.

my experience with this "rain shower" is not much different from normal showers. And the suction cup will come off after a month. Had to resort to screwing the thing on.

Exactly why I would not recommend buying this type of "rain shower", unless the intention is to buy a normal hand shower.

Our rain shower is just using standard 1/2" piping, as provided by renovation contractor. 

Take longer to shower is because want to rub everywhere  

It is not the rain shower fault, it is the human fault having too many places to rub.

Our thimbles were at the shower outlet.
 

There may however be an additional thimble at the water meter which we don't bother with because we believe we've done all necessary by removing the thimbles at the shower taps.



 
 

We got letter fm hdb asking us to help save water n ty do a one time installation of a thimble at e meter.
 

I reply dun wan also ty put. Damm. Now my master bedroom shower n basin tap not powerful. :angry:
