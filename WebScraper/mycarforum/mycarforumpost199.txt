High level condo may face crawlies problem unless u install a watertight refuse chute that cost $500 in the first place.. landed sure have unless u pour sulphur + pesticides around house perimeters every now and then and seal the drainage that connects to outside.

Pest.....u refering to human beings as well?   

Pesky neighbours peering over my walls, don't knw for what,

And other pple's maids as well, most probably to check for any new addition to my household.
 

I have cats from neighbours that like to poo on my lawn, despite my having big dogs around.

I am staying on a 14th floor flat for 5 years, the no of cockroach sigthing inside my flat is not more than 5 i think, even though there are many cockroaches on my void deck. I hate to play the pest buster man role (fact is I am a bit scared of cockroaches too). If this is a frequent problem in landed, then it may be one factor to consider hehee...

Depends on ur luck. Have 2 friends.....condo in Upp Bukit Timah (not ground flr ), discovered Termites

in door frames, skirtings, shoe cabinets...etc...

It seemed that the ants went up via concealed trunkings from the ground up.
 

Cockroaches can find their way into the apt when there's dampness in cabinets, esp under the sinks in kitchen & bathrooms.

Also when there's pesticide fogging of the garbage chutes. Oh, also creepy crawlies like spiders and other insects too when 

the gardener mows the grass. Learnt this when I rented an apt on 2nd level of a condo while waiting out A&A to my hse.

Really freaked me out!

generally, insects and mosquitoes will be less and less from 7th floor onwards. not even houseflies. 
 

if you believe in TCM and other related stuff, it is better to stay nearer to the surface of earth, ie: ground floor.

Pardon me but it seems like a silly reason to buy the condo over the landed.
 

The landed is a better long term investment in land-scarce singapore. You are going to be so thankful for amount of space you are getting, especially when singapore is gonna get super crowded in the next 20 years.
 

To live in, buy landed.
 

To invest (rental yield, capital appreciation, etc), buy resale HDB or Condo.
 

May I add that if pests are your problem, you are gonna get so many pests in the human form at condos.

Aiyoh please don't do that leh..... House with nice garden become house with outdoor tiled flooring.... Like those red light houses in geylang... Singapore already so built up with tiles and concrete everywhere.... It is nice to have a big piece of greenery in your own home.

Actually i feel it depends on individual and on locations for both condos and landed. 
 

Sometimes, a nice condo/penthouse might offer nicer living environment than some small landed terrace house. 

For those living in high floors, it is always quite windy and cool.
 

Of course not talking about those 25,000 sq ft GCB , but those normal terrace or semi-d tend to be rather warm and stuffy.

Also, parking is almost always a contentious issue with landed properties. 

Really feel it when visiting during CNY, no place to park, got to park like 3 streets away in front of other people house. 

Then those people unhappy, glare at you when you leave. 
 

Somemore, many of those landed are in small cul-de-sacs, both sides parked with cars, want to get out need 4 or 5 point turn. 

In fact, really dread to visit a relative in the Telok Kurau area for CNY, basically only 1 way in or out. 

Both sides got cars. Drive 5m got to try to slot one side, cos got car in front driving towards u. 

I ever got stuck behind a car who was having a face-off with with the other car also dun want to give way. 

One of the cars in front rang the door bell of one of the cars owners parked along side the road to drive his car inside, so can end the face-off. 

The house owner also one kind, can park at least 2 cars inside his house, insist on leaving his car outside to 'chope' the space. 

Landed is of course large and comfy in land scarce Singapore, but i think there are also externalities to live with. 
 

Of course condo got its own issues, but if you get a penthouse, maybe with a private lift lobby, or maybe even designated parking lot, many of the contentious issues are resolved.

Like some here have said, it depends on the condo also.  

My simplistic view on this..

When live in landed, insects are considered small time pests :))
 

My in-laws live in landed. When i sleepover and walk down to kitchen at early hours and see movements from corner of my  eye,must investigate. Cannot afford to dismiss as imagination, unlike in flat.
 

Intruders so far: monkey, frogs, a bat, rat, snake (probably going after the same rat  ), centipede...  There are more

You all talk like never talk.
 

Condo maintenance how much a month? A year?
 

If you spend that amount, can more than maintain pest busters contract for a year.  Confirm no pests. The leftover can maintain your swimming pool (quarterly or bi) and small elevator for a year also if no big issues.

that is why must choose your place wisely, not all landed has parking issues. My place is near the end of the road but it does not terminate in a cul-de-sac. Rather there is a perpendicular road WITH NO HOUSES on both sides joining to the next parallel road so parking is almost never an issue even on peak period like CNY. You don't see that nowadays as the land used for that road can probably built a few more units of terrace houses. 
 

Also you don't have to do 3 point turns to reverse out. The road is also wide enough to park on both sides and still let traffic through.

This also depends on where your landed is. If your landed borders a nature reserve than you have plenty of such things.
 

I have stayed in my place for 3+ years and the biggest thing I have seen is lizard. I don't think you will see much "wildlife" as long as your landed don't border a forest.
 

I think the age of the landed is also impt. If the place is "newly" built, I think the first few years might have things like snakes. But all these wildlife will die off after some years.

As I said, it all depends on where the landed is located.
 

Common sense right? If your landed is beside a forest, you don't expect to be bug free right?
 

But if your landed is in the middle of an estate, there isn't really much bugs.

Like I mentioned, regular pest-proofing your house is a must.
 

Cost will not be anything near the maintenance fees you pay in a condo.  You mentioned well-located high end condo. The maintenance fees for these range from $700 to $1000 a month or more, with sinking fund included.  You ask the rentokil man come once a month cost you how much only?
 

Condos also do regular pesticide spraying mah, that's why you don't have bugs in condo.
 

Ok so with this issue mitigated, ready to buy a landed?

Landed property will tend to have pest problems.
 

My experience is not with things like ants and cockroaches.
 

My last house, a snake was found sleeping on my massage chair.
 

Current place, a snake was seen eating a 4 legged iguana in the tree in front, and a family of monkeys keep coming into my property and sometimes even drink from my lap pool.

Run out and run away to die mah. After few times regular spraying will have fewer liao.
 

You think condo magically got no pests just because it is a condo?  Lots of people don't appreciate all the background work that is done to maintain the condo grounds.  The same kind of work you could pay someone to do in your landed grounds.

My friend lives in The Raintree, a condo and gets monkeys all the time.
 

My uncle lives in a landed deep deep into Jalan Kampong Chantek / Swiss Club area, a landed area close to forested area, and gets only few pests. At most a tiny harmless garden snake.

Safer buy condo lah. 'Cos with 6.9m target, very soon they will start to do land acquisition for low density areas. 
 

Or buy HDB ground floor. Pay $66 monthly and everything solved.

i have been through it all 

let me share my insights 
 

i just moved from a D13 semi d to D9 condo 

why ? 
 

Semi D 

- nice garden 

- personal porch, got space to sun my shoes, mattress, car, carpets ... almost any Fxk thing can sun 

- many bedrooms

- can configure the design of the house to any way i want... Jap theme, Euro theme, Greek theme, more Zen theme 

- neighbors, jostling for parking with those low class can be quite a nightmare ... esp if you have those old fogeys that refuse to die and their multiple useless brats (and their brats) that continue to live with the parents, to sponge off the old fcukers 

i speak for myself bcos my old neighbor was 80 yrs old but still didnt die, had 12 people, 4 dogs and 8 cars living there 

That does not include my other neighbor with 3 persons,4 cars

- i used to have a pest problem including rats and flies bcos one house nearby was rented to a construction company to house their bangala workers... things got better after they got caught 
 
 

Condo 

- near orchard.. shiok shiok 

- no maintenance required ... now my maid free like fcuk. I am going to fire her soon 

- but no place to wash car, sun carpets, sun clothes and shoes 

- clothes dont dry so fast ... very stinky 

- parking no problem bcos everyone gets a lot. 

- No one will harass you bcos everyone has a expensive car... if not 2 expensive cars. 

i use to have some more high end cars in the whole street... now i am the poorest f--ker with the cheapest cars in the whole car park 
 

what works for you ? entirely up to you to decide

Have a chance to live in Landed, dealbreaker is whether pest is a problem!
 

Uniquely Singapore. 
 
 

Anyway, on top of pest problem, you will get a lot of mostique bites as well. If you live near a main road,  alot of dust as well.

Currently staying landed. Other than the usual lizards, have kenna 
 

1) rats once (lucky only once) in my shoe rack which is outside at the car porch. I keep my dry dog food there.
 

2) Centipedes/millipedes/earthworms once every 2-3 months.
 

Surprisingly, no cockroaches YET.
 

But everyday, got butterflies, dragonfiles, bees and occasionally, hummingbirds will pop by for a visit at my little garden.

+ If stay so called landed, you can BBQ anytime!  
 

+ You can organise a lot of events in without issue, as long as not too loud. 
 

+ You can watch your kids play while sit at one corner drink kopi, & read Manchester Times.
 

+ You can have a garage to play with your cars, or wash your car without worry weather too hot or cold, or during precipication. but I notice very seldom do people have garage in Singapore. 
 

+ Depending, you may have the chance to style your home (within restriction & limit). 
 

- Of course for the lazy, you need more maintences, but no biggy if you have maids I guess.

- Parkings for your visiters is always a problem.

uncle, the Raintree what? you call yourself the Raintree and dun expect monkeys to come???
 

Beside the Raintree condo according the map is actually right beside a forest.
 

Is you Uncle unit bordering the forest or is there another unit shielding him? That area looks quite expensive so maybe if there is another unit shielding him, that unit does excellent pest control and repel everything :)

Deciding between high level condo or landed property. Wife n kids r terrified of cockroaches n other crawlies. Will this problem be prevalent in landed. Undetstand lizards r unavoidable though.



 

No issues with any pests.
 

A few lizards but they remain mostly outside.

Once in a while put lizard trap and they disappear for a few weeks, then slowly come back.

In any case it's just a few lizards at the most.

No roaches nor other crawlies.

No rodents either.

Occasionally a dragonfly or two but harmless

Also some grasshoppers which are quite entertaining

Ants are pretty common but they are easily eliminated.

A few small spiders here and there in store rooms etc...

But no real issues whatsoever.
 

It is important that the landed house is not near eateries, otherwise you will get a lot of pest problems.

Thats why when i buy landed property, i stay away from properties near eateries no matter what.

You should see how much those semi detached houses along main road Sixth ave are asking for today.
 

5 years ago nobody even wanted to look at them.  There were much better located properties inside the estates off Sixth Avenue.
 

Today these main road houses are asking ridiculous prices, just because landed properties are booming and they happen to be in district 10.  And many idiots are biting!
 

Sixth Ave is slated for road-widening and will probably eat into the properties along the main road. Many agents will not tell you that.  Couple of years ago, I have seen one main road Sixth Ave house with its setback pushed so far in that the car porch can only hold half a car! Which means that you can never close your gate when a car is parked inside. That's just so pathetic!!

Its an opinion, but a penthouse is still an apartment on an apartment block. Just that it is usually the highest, & have option of personal view & maybe a small garden. 
 

You still have the restriction of the apartments, like you cannot make the penthouse to your specification (at least not the exterior). You cannot hold big party or do something that may disturb the people in the condo. Its still not your own house, & you still have to use a share parking, though maybe your own carplace, but for sure not a garage, use the lift like evryone else.

Deciding between high level condo or landed property. Wife n kids r terrified of cockroaches n other crawlies. Will this problem be prevalent in landed. Undetstand lizards r unavoidable though.



 

I think if you diligently clear your rubbish bins, you wouldn't get cockroaches that often. Regardless of high-rise condos or landed.

My home everyday also can see lizards, but that's because got a lot of ants. Yes, I think landed property's most common pest is the ant. So, with ants, you get lizards, cos never ending flow of food source.
 

Nowadays, I keep getting birds, not the common birds, but the exotic ones like this:


 

Past 2 years, I have birds building nests on my plants as well. So it was fun.
 

But the worst thing about landed? Buy newspaper also must drive. Very expensive newspaper.
