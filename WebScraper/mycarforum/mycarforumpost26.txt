Hi 
Â 

Please advise if you have engaged the above service provider and are pleased with their performance.
Â 

I'm contemplating to engage them for my 5-room flat, maybe on a twice-weekly basis. 
Â 

A check on the internet showed there are many of them. The inevitable question is, which one is good?
Â 

Thanks

I had done my spring cleaning by Home Cleaning Services Singapre.

I find that the service is quite good and the price is reasonable.

Maybe u can try my recommendation.
