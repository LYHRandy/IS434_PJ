Maybe left the unit at 2nd floor, facing the compactor.
 
May not be bad, sometimes there are units left untouched.
a unit 2 floor below me is still unoccupied after 3 years

check the online site for the available flats left before going down.
 
if theres nothing that you like or you think u can live with, then bo bian and give up this chance.
 
iirc. my first bto Q was 900+ even with the increased chance cos i was balloting for new flat near my parents place. bao jiak nothing good left so i didnt bother turning up at all.
 
2nd bto got 70+. thought it was damn good but still not good enough >< the blocks with the better river/reservoir views were all taken. in the end managed to get a high unit facing courtyard.
 
its all about luck!! good luck to you bro!

no low floor.. < 5
 
good times , bad times.. they are hard to sell off..
 
and noisy.
1) from the void deck
2) from the rubbish
3) pipes.. imagine.. the whole night wish-washy coming from the toilet.
 
and dirty
1) ash / paper from the higher flr
2) pest invasion will be earlier than other flrs.

Just go there and see see...
you never know those infront of you may have opt out and may not choose some units...
 
I am sure there will be units left for you to choose, though they may not be of optimum units... but, no harm just see see.
 
Anyway, a house is a lifetime commitment, or at least MOP of 5 years commitment, so good to consider thoroughly, before making a decision.
 
Good Luck, Bro :)

Don't give up yet until the last 3 days of your selection date, you go into HDB website and view which units are left. At that time you can clearly know "what would be left for YOU to choose" !!

Guess confirmed you will be able to select a flat cause confirmed there are people give up. But if you want nice nice facing or high floor, then maybe difficult. But still depends on your luck, maybe there are many people give up on their selection of flat, then you will have more choice on your appointment day.

I did mine in 2008 my queue number is 868 with 686 units. I still get something on the 7th floor. It is still possible to get higher floors but location is also another thing for one to ponder. Anyway with that queue number I think you still can get decent units.

Your queue number exceeded 182 on flat offered and yet still able to get a unit on 7th floor? Looks like back then that BTO project of yours many people gave up on their appointment day, or applied for the sake of apply, that's why still can get a flat.
 
Usually if your queue number exceeded above 120 on flat offered, chances very low. Cause i have one friend queue number exceeded 125, in the end no unit available on the appointment day, even 2nd floor also don't have.

my present 4 rooms is a resales flat i bought at the price of SUPER PEAK just b4 Suharto collapsed.
 
i can sell my unit at $480k, less outstanding of $100k, i think i could 100% pay-off my new unit @ pungol. (if my calculation is correct)

Think not only punggol when people hear will run away. Every brand new hdb town, when people hear also will run away. Like donkey years ago, when people heard yishun, jurong west and tampiness etc, people run far far away. But now these places have become so popular!

Many say Tampines is a good location. moving from Tampines to Pungol is downgrading.
 
well, my neighborhood is 15 mins walk to Tampines Mall and 15 mins walk to Simei MRT. 5 mins drive to PIE, 10 mins to TPE, 15 mins can hit ECP, 20 mins can hit Changi AP.  
 
not a bad location, that's why am moving IF only i get a good choice of unit.

15 mins walk to mrt and mall consider not near le. How come tampines to airport needs to take 20 mins? Even from west to airport can reach around 30 mins if no jam.

units from WIS are those that were from earlier BTOs which had been selected by flat applicants but sales was cancelled due to unsuccessful in loan application and unfulfilled conditions.

Sometimes its just weird. Travelling in expressway from east to west may take less than 20 min. So people live in east but far from xpressway vs people live in west near expressway, not much diff

bro, there are many differences la.
 
1. from west to east needs 20km = 2 litre of fuel + wear and tear of vehicle
2. ERP gantry (depending timing)
3. 20KM of journey to meet traffic jam.
 
sometimes 20 mins can become 60 mins or even longer.

You need to return the interest to CPF right? $480K will be lesser to pay for the next flat.

I'm not sure why but usually there must be something "not good" in that whole block which makes it vacant even at the top floors...... Eg. face west, furthest from the nearest bus stop, in front of a rubbish chute, no view, etc. I notice such situation when I did my BTO selection a few years back.
 
If it is not, then you got good luck bro!

Face carpark put curtain, rubbish chute put auto air freshener and bukit merah got power station is it? Think whole tower being affected already no need low or high floor
 
 
 
Moreover low floor is good, no need wait for lift when in rush, just take staircase and in case of fire u r the first one to come out of building

I Was think the same also but from the way it look, there is nothing wrong with the unit, the Number is also not some unlucky number in most language. Probably because there will be education center at our blk or becasue our blk will be the last one to be develop and ppl cannot wait, other then that, I cannot think of a reason why, =(

it was not as bad then before the HDB announced that they will be cutting down BTO in the coming years.
 
cutting down BTO would means slow down or no development in those under developed area.

it also mean you will have lesser BTO to chose from.
 
so you don't need a new house then.

Not so bad la, got nice serenity around punggol area. Very nice park connector if you cycle or run/jog regularly, just that alot of drifting spider webs even in an open area.

Wow, from the letter it stated selection will start from mid Sept. Your appointment to select a flat is Dec. Needs 3 months for ppl to select flat. That's quite a long wait.

In few years time, Punggol and SengKang will be developed towns.. just like AMK, TP ...
 
The next phase of public housing development will be in north west areas like Lim Chu Kang areas and Tengah areas....
These areas will soon be cleared for housing needs...

You do not intend to select flat due to location deserted but you applied for BTO in punggol in the first place?

Maybe no need 10-15 years. I lived in Tampines when there was no bus interchange, no MRT station, from the early days until Tampines has 3 malls. Took more than 10 years to reach that stage.
 
Punggol probably just needs another 5 to 10 years to develop further. Only question is whether it will develop to the level of Tampines.

Hi Yeobt, when you applied for your BTO did HDB mentioned that you as 2nd time application? Cos 2nd time application chances are very low to get a flat. Also 2nd time application must pay a $45000 levy to HDB.

So you applied as a 2nd timer and still got a slot in the ballot. But you give it up due to location not good.

Yup. Small percentage is allocated to 2nd timer. HDB changed their estate planning. So I changed my mind lor. I don't think I'm the only one opt out. This is norm, that's why HDB has a penalty scheme in place to minimise opt out rate.

What's the penalty for opting out?
