This one picha lobang on TV lah.
 

If you watched the news last night, you'll understand.
 

ERA is the exclusive and many in the queue were students.
 

When interviewed, the students were asked how much they were paid. It was between $8-10/hour.
 

When asked, who will they collect the payment from. One replied,"From the housing agent."  
 

When the tried to interview representative from ERA, none was available for interview.

Anyway, I can guess the script when they interview ERA later, housing agents pay students on behalf of their overseas clients (Mainland Chinese who can't be in SG) ;)  
 

I can't understand why people will pay up to $1.3k psf for 99 year lease.

told to u by agent izit? maybe that's what alot of other buyers oso tink. very dangerous. 
 

$$ outlay would consist up to 40% d/p, 3% stamp duty, lawyer fee, monthly instalment and 4-16% stamp duty if sell within the first 4 yrs. that is assuming the mkt doesn't dip and bank exercises margin call. 
 

moral of story: no holding power, dun dabble in property.

Not surprising. It could be the agents themselves creating a hype or pend-up demand and call the news reporters. They always do funny things when the market is downing  What is happening behind, we didn't know. I better stay aside and watch the muiscal chair play for now. To me, it looks like a better fools game. 
 

P/S : China have many empty mid to high-end properties now and having problems to sell. And PRC gov is tightening loans. Hence they come to SG and buy for investment or flip. Will Singapore be the next? Who knows.

You are right on this. Many ppl do that. But... if you are caught off guard in sudden panic sell off. You start to see more non performing loans from the banks. This will in-turn trigger banks to start suing ppl and ppl will go throuh a painful period of repayments or even loss their shirts.

Currently, buyers still holding on. Once the first sign of panic sell off, this will trigger massy situations

Everyone wants to make a tidy profit.

Monkey see Monkey do.

But this will not be sustainable.
 

Lets see when recession hits again.

Hopefully it hits in a BIG way.

i know of ppl who onli barely managed to break even on their property which they bought in 1Q 1996 juz b4 the crash. this is despite the last few years of boom. when i asked them how come they were so brave to buy then when things were realli heated then, it was the same reason: since everyone was buying, it can't be wrong. 
 

buyers have short memories. and because of this, history always repeats itself.

I think those who maxed up, are getting in to trouble soon. I have heard banks' non performing loans(NPLs) started to unfold. But they did not show where these "NPLs" comes from. The news link shall explains it all.

Look at this!! This is what I meant by, a disconnected between the real economy and the property prices. Is not sustainable. I guess, this time round the big fish and those agents who scoup up properties may get into trouble.
