Hi to all fengshui experts. Any special ritual to conduct when entering your house for the first time? Like scattering rice grains/green peas etc. Any steps to follow or website to refer to? I tried to search but to no avail.
 

Is there a difference between moving house and entering house for first time?
 

Or such rituals need to be conducted only when moving house? When go and check for defects no need?
 

Thanks alot for any help!

Don't be fooled.

The contractors and bangla workers will con you to put red packets in every corner of the house, and let the workers take the money and bad luck away from the house.

completely new house has lots of smell of industrial solvents like paint, thinner etc which is not very good for health.  need to get rid of those smell.
 

some will say need to rid the spirits residing in the house although a completely new one may not have spiritual beings residing there.
 

these 2 steps are pre-moving in
 

on the day of moving in, some people will do some 入伙仪式 for good luck.  the steps may vary a bit.

And should it be done only when I want to move in? Initial defects checking etc can don't do it. Thanks!

1. Strip naked  at your doorstep.(This will prevent you bringing in contamination & bad luck into the house)

2. After your first step into the house do 10 squats with hands pulling your ears. (something to do with customs and up north).

3. Follow by duck-walk clockwise around the living room 5 rounds, counter-clockwise another 5 rounds.(again something to do with customs and up north).

4. 20 push ups and 20 sit-ups in each room.

5. lastly 20 counts of 4 jumping jets in the kitchen facing the kitchen windows.
 

4 & 5 will get you warmed up for the house cleaning you are about to do.

My experience.
 

Get a powerful LED torchlight. It will reveal uneven walls, floors, tiles, when you shine at it from a straight angle( placing the torchlight flat on the floor and wall)
 

Get a UV flashlight, it will reveal all the patching work done on the door frames, wood skirtings, stains marking on painted walled, etc.

Some say the UV light will also reveal any dirty things in the corners or ceilings of the TOP house.
 

Enjoy your new house!!

unfortunately there is no tried and tested method.
 

some, especially the hokkien inspired ones, will roll in the pineapple because it sounds lke come prosperity 旺来
 

some, believe must boil water becaue wind blows, water rises 风生水起
 

some believe in order to have healthy people living there must carry a stove with fire to the door and cross it.
 

i personally believe choosing an auspicious date is most important, the rest of activity is just symbolic to reinforce the auspicious date.

the fengshui master scan the surronding, is to guage the qi in your area, and what are the good and bad things, so they can then draft a formation, ideally for your home..... then every year they give u a free seminal, to tell you where to change the 8 gods items. pricing is inclusive of the items, so maybe mine is so exp lol. to me fengshui very important la, and i am superstitious type. take note, the scannign of surrounding will take 1 week, and then the following week he will then go your new home, to see your home fengshui. he is reputable, as always got those bosses open factory like to find him 1

Actually instead of worrying all these "ritual", you should be spending time in selecting a house (and it's layout) that is suitable for your Kua number and most importantly, the flying stars natal chart of your house.
 

If you can get the basic feng shui correct for your house, all these ritual is not neccessary. Infact, even enhancements are not needed. At most is minor adjustment from year to year if you are very supertitious because the annual flying star chart changes from year to year. But most important is the flying star natal chart in agreement for your house.
 

Now assuming you have not done that, then you better get a feng shui master to do the neccessary flying star check instead of ritual. Prepare your floorplan for him. He will need that. The rest he will do it himself, like taking facing.
 

If your house has missing corners, pray that star #5 falls in that corner. That's the best!

Buy 8 pinapples and roll into the house and shout "Ong Lai Ong Lai'.

Change $1888 1 dollar gold coin and throw it all over the house. Leave them there for 7-7 49 hours.After that collect them all into a box and place it under your bed.

Do a google - there are many things you can do to bring good luck to the house. 
 

Remember to carry wifey across threshold for the first time (new house should do - she will think very romantic one_) 
 

Remember that you must "christen" every room before anyone else does (andd hope the banglas never christen before you) - preferable to do this in the first week, and then repeat annually. 
 

Make it a point to say hello to your neighbours also.

Sounds more like a QA inspection rather than for 4 dimensional beings.
 
 

Activating fireplace and boiling kettle of water or simple meal is very important.

Just like putting tissue papers at foodcourt table.
 
 

Some will get holy water from temple to cleanse the house or get a monk to perform simple prayers.
 

If you have access to lion dance that can be employed to chase away any spirits away, and bring in positive Chi
 
 
 

Overall- If you and family members feel good and comfortable while in the house, that is most important. Babies and kids are more sensitive to these things- if they are happy so no problem lah.

after i collect my keys to my 3rm resale flat, the first official day i went to my OWN flat, my mom bought 7 types of beans mixed together and then threw the beans all over the floor of every room of the flat. I dunno what's the meaning though.
 

then we proceeded to clean up the flat - sweep and wash and mop.
 

then after a week or so, invited a number of relatives to my flat to make it "lively".
 

that's about it.

Personally I've moved into re-sale units twice. No issue although did not conduct any special ritual. First unit, absolutely no ritual... I moved in to stay alone first, also no weird happenings. Second unit, other than my in-laws moving in prayer altar from their house, and that was about it - no special feng shui stuff either.
 

I don't totally disbelieve this spiritual thing - but a good guide is to look at the previous owner/family staying in the house. If they appear to be a happy well-balanced family and the home is cheery and bright - likely there will be no spiritual troubles expected. Observation is important when buying a new home.

Haha..perhaps a way to gauge the previous family is how much COV did they earn from you?
 

If they manage to earn a lot, then they should be cheerful family.  
 

If they willing to accept little COV from you, then maybe they are in trouble....better don't buy?

i bought directly from JTC ... only paid $4k COV ... i consider it more like a "admin fee" to them.
 

coincidentally, the next day there was a unit right beside the unit i was buying ... i thot got chance to nego ... but end up the private seller was asking for $30k COV !!! I just told them i "wud think about it" before walking out.

Err...JTC got sell HDB units? How does it work?
 

Does JTC sell 3 rms?
 

BTW, 30k COV thesedays is cheap.
 

Some of my friends looking for HDB told me that all the units he went to are asking for minimum 60k COV. One even ask for 100k even though the unit is already 30 years old.

that was 6 years ago already ... from what the agent said, JTC bought some units to house their employees ... so when the contract  was up, they decided to dispose of their assets and sold off the units on the resale market.
 

I visited 2 of these JTC units - both also $4k cov, but decided on my current unit instead.
 

when i went flat searching that time, highest asking cov was $40k from an old couple's 3rm flat just opposite Century Sq.

When move to new house, one important ritual is to invite the 18 Tiko Rangers to grace your place. Don't forget the Martell CB and JW BL(can be substituted by Chivas RS) , the roast meats and sharks fins soup to be placed with 18 cutlery sets and rock glasses, no candles and joss sticks are required. The 18 Tiko Rangers will take care of the rest and fill your house with merriment.

I am actually not looking at some kind of ritual (pardon my using of ritual in my thread) but rather some kind of traditional customs which people usually adopt for good luck, safe safe smooth smooth etc. In fact, I'm not even sure if bai bai is allowed outside, needa go check it out.
 

Bro Minikong, as I am moving to a new flat just TOP, is there a need to get a fengshui master to scan the surrounding? My understanding of scanning the surrounding is to detect "dirty" things? or its actually to find out the different good luck positions etc etc.
 

Thanks!



 

Based on your inquiry, juz seek your FS master by providing both you and spouse your DOB/timing, he will know how to calculate for the auspicious timing to enter new homes.
 

If you are not so 'pantang', juz buy 5 types of fruits (oranges, apples,pear, grapes & banana ) plus Huat Kuay & j/sticks t offer for safety-stay. MOst importance is the interior of the house, not the exterior, it does play a part though, but not so.
 

Take cae of your master room and kitchen area, ( as you sent time in preparing foods ) & living room, find out the orientation and the Yin energy 

'chi' comes from?
 

To save money, juz go buy/borrow books for library on how to cleanse your house on day 1 etc, ( Written by English lady is reliable too), For Sp and  My, read up Lilian Too WOFS. helps

when i got my flat, i also posted question about the "entrance ritual" and also asked about fengshui(FS).
 

but i got a reply from someone who said FS is going to cost you alot of $$$.
 

but if you want to do it, then must be prepared to go ALL the way.
 

if you want to be selective about the geomancer's recommendation$$, then better don't do anything at all.
 

think about it .... there is no "lite" version here.

All the way is touted by fs 'masters' who are just out to squeeze u of every cent possible. Watch out for those 'fs masters' who say u have to buy many things from them such as expensive crystals n what nots to ward off bad luck. These belong to the 'new age' fs that normally exploits your belief n fears.
 

The real fs does not require extensive expenditure on such stuff. But more of placement of furniture ensure a good flow of good chi. The very most is placing a symbol of wealth n health like a pixiu in the wealth portion of your place.

The real fs does not require extensive expenditure on such stuff. But more of placement of furniture ensure a good flow of good chi. The very most is placing a symbol of wealth n health like a pixiu in the wealth portion of your place.



 

Yup, I also heard that actually for good FS, sometimes only one or two simple things need to be done.
 

But then, how does the FS master justify his fee?? Therefore, he or she comes up with a whole list of things for you to do... but actually only one or two items in there are the really critical ones.

actually everyone can do some basic FS themselves.....these basic would have cover 80% of what is neccessary. For most people this is good enough.
 

For the rest of the 20%, if you are particular, you need to pay a lot of $$$ for a FS master....and that's provided he is honest. Most I think, charge a lot for that basic 80% which anyone in this forum can read up and do himself.
 

For reading up, I suggest Joey Yap's material instead of Lilian Too. Joey's material does not ask you to buy a lot of enhancing charms, unlike Lilian Too's one. Of course, the latter master has many FS shops...so the motivation for her to promote her goods.

Pixiu actually represents a pair, the Tianlu and the Bixie. 
 

Some believe that the tianlu is male and bixie is female, i'm not so sure, but sounds plausible. 
 

But generally, you get the main idea, tianlu is used to represent collection of wealth and good health while bixie represents protection, warding off evil spirits and bad luck.
 

The one that is usually selling madly is the Tianlu portion of pixiu, which is by legend, the 9th dragon prince, and brings in the wealth without letting it out. 
 
 

Others are dragonhead tortoise, golden qilin, wealth toad, and stone lions, if i'm not wrong.
 
 

But of course, different people different beliefs.

Hi to all fengshui experts. Any special ritual to conduct when entering your house for the first time? Like scattering rice grains/green peas etc. Any steps to follow or website to refer to? I tried to search but to no avail.
 

Is there a difference between moving house and entering house for first time?
 

Or such rituals need to be conducted only when moving house? When go and check for defects no need?
 

Thanks alot for any help!




Prevention better than cures (if can be cured)
 

Precaution: 

Many/more houses within twilight zones than we are aware. More twilight zones in each house than we are aware. I believe you must be aware of reports like burglary/suicide/mental illness/eath/fire sale/bank sale... Better consult a Feng Shui practicioner like Grandmaster Vincent Koh before/after purchase, if you too busy to attend such training.
 

So lucky, although I dwell within the twilight zone
