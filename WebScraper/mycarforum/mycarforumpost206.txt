 Sounds exactly like a property agent. To them no place is too ulu and every property is a bargain.
 

Why not say it's near to Bedok? I dun think it's near to any of the places you had mentioned.
 

Wait and see how many will back out from the deal later.

Housing site near Tanah Merah MRT gets S$434.6m top bid

04:45 AM Oct 17, 2012
 

SINGAPORE - The tender for a housing site in New Upper Changi Road attracted 11 bids by the close yesterday, with Keppel Land unit Sherwood Developments submitting the top bid of S$434.6 million, the Urban Redevelopment Authority said.
 

Located within an established private housing estate and close to Tanah Merah MRT Station, the 99-year leasehold site has an area of 343,171 sq ft and a maximum gross floor area of 549,078 sq ft. 
 

"When awarded the site ... Keppel Land plans to develop about 700 homes ranging from 500 to 1,400 sq ft in one- to four-bedroom configurations," said the developer, whose bid translates to S$791 per sq ft per plot ratio. 
 

Mr Lee Sze Teck, Senior Manager of Training, Research and Consultancy at DWG, noted that Sherwood's bid was 7.1 per cent higher than the second best bid from Bayfront Land, a joint venture between Fragrance Group and World Class Land.
 

The latter two won a tender for a housing site in nearby Tanah Merah Kechil in August at S$676 psfppr, and the higher prices bid for the New Upper Changi Road site underlined the confidence of developers in the property market, he said.
 

The estimated breakeven is between S$1,150 and S$1,200 psf, while the selling price could be in the range of S$1,400 to S$1,450 psf, higher than the average selling price of S$1,300 to S$1,400 psf at eCO at Bedok South, he added.

every property agent will said it's great location. Only dumb asses will believe in that. 
 

I went to Miltionia condo which is located in bloody orchid country club is so deep inside yishun and yet the agent can said this is a fanastic location and it's just a few mins drive to city... WTF.

What's wrong with ulu? 
 

After living in newton and river valley for the past few years, I really yearn for a move back to an ulu place, deep inside some quiet landed estate with few neighbors and lots of trees, where drive ways are big enough so that nobody has to park along the road...... To me that's good enough.... I don't need the convenience....  I just need a sanctuary away from the 5.3 million people packed into this little red dot... Soon to be 6 million...
 

Maybe I am getting old.

Well i believe a lot of people are going to suffer when the bubble really burst. Now there are so many restrictions and yet people rush in to buy at ridiculous. Name me another investment (gold, stock, unit trust, currencies, oil or whatever) that you buy already cannot sell within 4 years else get taxed heavily. 
 

This is a vicious cycle. More people buy then more people will be scared of being left out and would question themselves and in the end cannot wait anymore and rush in to buy. Now everyone is not just buying for themselves but buying for their children, scare their children cannot afford to buy one in future.

Yup. The boom may takes much longer than we anticipate. Let's see who swimming nude when the tied is down.   I rather invest other than physical property, that can be sold without capital gain taxes and restriction period.

I bought a bungalow of almost 3k Sq feet  few years ago in Malaysia for merely S$325k. And now yielding 14%. In addition, the property itself have also appreciated minimum twice   Besides, only left about 5+ years loan.   What more you can play in Singapore?

by the same reasoning, i can also say that Tuas/Boon Lay also very convienent as well....1 stop to jurong point, short drive to tuas causeway, furthermore there are great schools such as river valley sec school....best of all, it's near to premier institution like NTU. All roads lead to NTU hor....top MBA course. 
 

Best place for families with teenagers cos they will be entering army soon, sekali got admited to OCS....5 mins drive to OCS.

I went to Miltionia condo which is located in bloody orchid country club is so deep inside yishun and yet the agent can said this is a fanastic location and it's just a few mins drive to city... WTF.


Whats makes you think I have not been there and know what I am talking about? 

A ulu place is somewhere really far from anything and with limited access to any transport out. You call Tanah Merah ulu, what nonsense!
 

How you define good location?
 

To someone it may be right smack in town with all the convenience, to someone else it may be a serene and quiet location away from the action.
 

Only thing I agree is that to a property agent, anywhere they will say it's fantastic location.

$1500 psf for the not that ulu area is quite eye watering. 
 

definitely in bubble territory. a 3 bedder 1250 sf will cost 1.875 million.

Yup because the conditions such as lower interest rates than few years ago also added to the boom. Now those buying are still hoping for capital gains when the property is being completed. Reality will only hit them when the project TOP and they realise cannot flip for profit. Rental demand not there due to the huge supply. Then locked into a purchase at record price

La Casa sold in 2005 cost about 300+ psf.......3 times huat.

Even Woodlands is not ulu now, 2 new EC coming up besides La Casa near Ave 12.  
 

First time I see 3 EC together and 2 new ones will pop up beside it but price should be 1,000 psf cos of Thomson line MRT coming up near it.
 

La Casa sold in 2005 cost about 300+ psf.......3 times huat.

by the same reasoning, i can also say that Tuas/Boon Lay also very convienent as well....1 stop to jurong point, short drive to tuas causeway, furthermore there are great schools such as river valley sec school....best of all, it's near to premier institution like NTU. All roads lead to NTU hor....top MBA course. 
 

Best place for families with teenagers cos they will be entering army soon, sekali got admited to OCS....5 mins drive to OCS.



 

when u sell melons, of cos u will say your melons sweet lah   [laugh]

on a side note, why would anyone wnat to buy a mass market condo with hundreds or even close to a thousand units...isnt this the same as staying in hdb flat? Granted, the maintenance fees may be low...

1300psf region can opt for kovan, balestier, novena, jurong east hub, amk hub, and bedok central. 
 

Punggol only Watertown cost 1300psf the other averaged at 1000psf dun think got 1500psf there.



 

punggol watertown 1300psf is alr way over priced. most other punggol condos after TOP is just 1000psf. the slightly older ones can be bought at just 900psf. anyone who buy punggol watertown at 1300psf is sure going to bleed later.

Hill view is another over price estate.
 

'Foresque, when it was launched, it was about $1,200psf and that set the new benchmark. When The Hillier came in, it is now on average transacting between $1,500psf and $1,600psf.'

Ulu or not ulu largely depends on the individual. I used to stay HDB at Bedok, then move to Tanah Merah area up to the 90s area in my childhood to teen days. Thought that place was wonderful as all my friends were there. Cycled to East Coast every weekend. Had Tae Kwon Do lessons at Tanah Merah CC. 
 

Fast forward to present. I'm not staying with my parents as I've a place of my own much further away now. Miss the place? Yup. ...Move back there? Probably not as my life now revolves in the area where I'm staying now. 
 

But one things for sure. Property prices are damn high now so if need to buy, can settle for a reasonably good environment with what u can afford is already a luxury now.
