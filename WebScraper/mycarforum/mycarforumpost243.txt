I am currently overseas, not earning any income in S'pore. I am self employed. Thinking of buying a resale flat in S'pore with my wife. Plan to pay enough cash upfront such that the remaining loan amount (say about 200-250k) can be covered with what we currently have combined in our cpf accounts, even if there is no further contribution into our cpf accounts in future. Can we get a loan from HDB or a bank in our case, even when we have no income in S'pore? It's our 2nd purchase of a HDB flat.  Or would HDB allow us to use up all of our combined CPF + cash outlay to pay for the flat all at once? Appreciate any advice, thanks!

I am not buying for investment. Planning to move back to s'pore sometime in the next yr or so, just planning to come back first then look for a job, but want to have a place to stay first while looking, that's why looking to complete the buying process before we come back. Please don't assume everyone is caught up in the property craze and trying to earn a quick buck.

I think its just better for u to call/write email to HDB and ask. 
 

Only come forum for alternative answers.

- as long as you are singaporean, you are entitled to buy.
 

but as for the loan part, if you cannot guarantee that you can pay back, then its going to be difficult.

Unfortunately Sg is not like USA where
 

they let you buy property with no income
 

and then they wonder why the banks fail.

according to TS, he and his wife both got CPF presently .... so still can use it to slowly pay back until they come back to SG and start contributing again.
 

they only dun have income in SG but they have income elsewhere right ? if he want he can contribute CPF voluntarily every month even if he is overseas - just to make the CPF payback sum.

As long as you can prove you have income then should be OK. Maybe loan quantum lower.
 

Problem is if you have a property overseas now, they may want proof that you sold it off with 6 months as required by the new ruling.
 

Calling or emailing hdb is the best bet for an answer. Email Is best as you have black and white

KNN, we also got others here what, people like GS also very knowledgable, anyway, TS got money and got cpf, basically he is asking can he use cpf for his 2nd hdb flat, I am assuming he sold off his 1st already, so the answer is yes, you can use both cash and cpf to buy a hdb flat without taking any loan. The other part of his question is can he take loan, since as he said he doesn't mean a big loan, for 60% loan he can own overseas properties for all mas 626 cares, and for a 60% loan, we can do ABL as in Asset Base and foreign income can be recognize for such loan quantums.....
 

so am I a pro agent or what....or like those half past six ones like you know who

Thanks for all the replies and contributions above guys, and seems like Sabbie can really contribute meaningfully without talking c**k! Haha. Just realised I asked a stupid question coz if I have enough cpf to cover the loan amt, why do I need a loan anyway, since Sabbie already confirmed that can pay up one shot using cash + cpf, might as well pay one shot and be debt free. Will check with HDB to confirm this though. Thanks once again.

You can use cpf to pay for your property up to roughly 120% of the valuation if I am not wrong but anyway doesn't apply for TS's case, if his cpf is enough he just needs to pay the COV in cash, the 5% in cash, and the balance in cpf if sufficient. Trust me la, when it comes to serious questions I do not talk c--k, but if people wana to screw with me I just screw with them lor.....

and oh, I also think there is a difference between good debt and bad debt, since interest rates are hovering around 1 to 1.5% now, if may be worth it to keep cash to invest selectively if market drops further

if your cash and CPF is enough to cover the purchase, u do not even need a loan. but bear in mind, in order to purchase a resale hdb, u cant own any private property in sg or overseas. If not u are given 6 months to sell off. PM me if u need more details.

U will need to sell off the overseas or local private property if u plan to buy a hdb flat. 60% is for people buying a 2nd house with outstanding housing loan.

Can I know what is the mkt rate for commission for buying and selling a hdb flat now? Five yrs ago when I sold my hdb it was 1.5%, not sure if it has changed now. One of my relatives has a 4 rm unit near to NEL, they might want to start looking for prospective buyers after CNY.

Most of my clients pay me 2% for selling, 1% for buying. however if u let me handle both your buying and selling, then we can sit down and discuss.

Every agent worth his/her salt is doing this, get another "friendly" agent to front for him/her and split commission 2 ways.  Big time conflict of interest.  
 

Anyway, I remember during last property bull run (1996), young people were applying HDB flats before they start work as the wait for a new flat can be up to 3 to 5 years, how did it work then? Based on expected future income?

I remember people were so worried about rising prices they registered for a HDB flat while in school, maybe you just have to show proof of income when it is your turn to select the flat as putting your name in the queue does not cost money nor require detailed documentation on income.

i guess u read my comment wrongly. i charge my client (sellers) 2%. I do serve buyer to buy house too. (1%) 

I do alot of back to back deal too, meaning helping my client to sell their current house and helping them buy another. Nothing wrong with this as both are different property.

Ic, yup, that's why I was clarifying with you, your 2% selling is for hdb? I usually pay my agents 1 to 1.75% for selling my condos only depending if they can hit the price I want

Not sure what is hdb's loan criteria then, for banks, perhaps they waited till a few months before TOP to apply for loan when they are working.

i remember a neighbour then were post-grad students from nus, they had to pay 80% of the flat in cash. But then again, it's probably just 150k cash for a 5 room flat or 80k for a 3rm. No big deal compared to now.
 

as to TS question, i understand that bank could extend a loan if you put a fixed dep with them. E.g. 300k will give you ard 1mil loan, without ant income required. But that's for pte, hdb i am not sure if they can do the same. Cash hor.. not CPF..

I am currently overseas, not earning any income in S'pore. I am self employed. Thinking of buying a resale flat in S'pore with my wife. Plan to pay enough cash upfront such that the remaining loan amount (say about 200-250k) can be covered with what we currently have combined in our cpf accounts, even if there is no further contribution into our cpf accounts in future. Can we get a loan from HDB or a bank in our case, even when we have no income in S'pore? It's our 2nd purchase of a HDB flat.  Or would HDB allow us to use up all of our combined CPF + cash outlay to pay for the flat all at once? Appreciate any advice, thanks!



 

Good time to buy, COV are now a lot more reasonable.  If you qualify for BTO and can wait, you should go for it, can save 200k and more.

i dunno about the "making a quick buck" thingy ... but alternatively, one can look at it as saving money instead.
 

buy now $300k .... buy 3 years later, $350k.
 

so if buy now, can save $50k when TS finally moves back to SG to stay.
