I feel this one is over priced, and right next to Parkway Parade which has very heavy traffic flow. 
 

willing buyer, willing seller ... I suppose.

Should be willing buy, happy seller.
 

Everybody is looking to bounce on chances to buy condo no matter at wad price.

Perhaps is the trend that buying condo which its TOP is 2-3 yrs later hoping to sell at high price. Since bank interest drop why not invest their surplus else where + nothing else is making money except property in SG.

C'mon, the only selling point is the so-called seaview (last remaining development to have that). But if you realize, that only applies to the 3/4/penthouse units, and those minimum got to fork out $2million!! Is it really worth to pay that amount for seaview? I would think the Parc Seabreeze down the road would be a better investment, considering it's freehold and nearer to the upcoming MRT @ Parkway Parade.
 

Anyway, when I was at the showroom on Saturday, I have already seen some "SOLD" stickers pasted on about 30% of the units launched. Maybe these buyers have a differing view lor. Like what someone mention, willing buyer happy seller.

Bloody pathetic space in that development. The largest penthouse is only 1,400 sqft. The only people who will rent out those units will be those parents who want to locate within 1km of the branded schools around that area.
 

With studio units at The Sail going for $3000 a month, you would realistically be looking at renting out a unit at the Edge for 2-2.5k.

Heard that 1000+ visitors throng the Silversea showflat & they managed to sell 10+ units.. Full page adverts & sell only 10+ units goes to show how overpriced the product is... 99 years on previous HUDC site wants to sell at Freehold Meyer rd price.... Likely,the 10+ buyers must have been overwhelm by the nice showflat.

Silver Sea is a good project. However, too bad it is not freehold and the price is kinda steep. But then again, those who buy are those who wants the full view of the sea and willing to pay that kinda price. Yes, other developments in that area can also have sea view. But they are only pockets of the sea which they can see. My client recently bought a high high floor unit there at under $2.75mil, but the view will be spectacular.

Hate to sound like a wet blanket but all I have to say is that some developers got a very powerful marketing arm that is not only able to make their buyers stomach cut-throat pricing, play them like a fiddle by witholding units and relasing them bit by bit by bit whilst eating into the property tenure and yet still walk away smelling like roses.
 

If u do your research, you will notice a perculiar sales pattern to these developments and it is usually to the detriment of those unsuspecting first wave buyers....

Parc Seabreeze is a more exclusive buy. Definitely more value for $$$ compared to Silversea.

Both are just as crap.
 

PS is riddled with balconies and the non master bedrooms are so small (with one single bed in it, you can hardly walk, yes there is a freaking balcony in the room as well).
 

And there are 3 bloody pools in a development with 94 units. (This is the best pool to unit ratio condo I have ever seen)
 

99yr-&-counting Silversea priced at 1300-1600 when all the freehold in the area are priced lower. The only thing FEO managed to do is to help some One Amber flippers get out at 1000psf.
 

If you are buying into new development with much higher valuation than other surrounding similar lease-type of development, pls be careful. It is in the interest of the developer's bank to "assist" with the developer's own pricing (valuation) even if it is significantly higher than the surrounding condos. 
 

If the developer cannot sell, the bank will also "tng kor" together with the developer. But if the condo sells out, then the risk (loan) is now shared among the owners of the spanking new owner.
 

So, not every glossy new project is as desirable as you think.

Neither. i rather take sea view (if you are ok with 500+ unit development).
 

Location of PS is good but i think they never really put much thought into the project. Feels like a very rush to plan/submit/get approval/launch kind of project to me.
 

A lot space went into balconies (at least 3 in each unit). 2 pools on ground level and one in the middle floor. WTF??? Why'd I want to pay for so many pools? For a 94 unit development, u need 3 pools?
 

SS (@1600psf for seaview) is too ex for 99yr leasehold, if u really like seaview, Meyer (freehold) area has better choices.

Really depends on how the finacing deal is being structured.... Typically the bank would have it in their covenant that X% of the total units must be sold at a price not below $Ypsf when the project is Z% completed and the sales proceed at this stage would have covered their construction cost which in terms would have covered the bank financing amount (assuming the developer is getting a construction loan). Hence there usually is no need for a project to be fully sold out for the bank to be covered.

there is a couple of other small projects around that area.. those with only 20 to 30 units, small swimming pool and a small bbq pit on top.. what do you think of these project.
 

its somethng that suits me as i don't like living with a lot of pple under a fenced area and the pricing is quite attractive to me personally... 800 plus psf for freehold...

There are tons of these small developments in the Telok Kurau area... One thing you got to bear in mind is that with fewer units, you many potentially have to "tng khor" when something goes wrong and the bill is shared among less # of residents....

thats 1 concern too.. but with the low number of pple living there, the chances of it happening will be lower too .. this is my thought as i have never bought a private apartment before. 

and for the potential growth, what do you think? my plan is to achieve long term stay plus investment growth. possible?
 

i was told by my colleague that never go for small scale projects, always go for those projects by BIG companies like Far east .. is this true?

but i notice these BIG companies project comes with BIG pricing too..

Nowadays, the price very high.

if you look at Upper Serangoon area, there is also a lot of projects there like this.
 

One project that i am particually interested in is the Sandiland.. its located at 3 sandiland road, a 20-25 unit private apartment, no security guard, gate open using remote, door using card scan (the tech quite impressive).. quite like the apartment especially when its at the top of a slope where you really get clear view ... 
 

downside is ... its in the mid of those private estates and its quite far to walk to the train station with all the up slopes and down slopes...

Wife's colleague bought something like this a couple of years ago. Maybe 70 units or so. Still got mid sized pool. No guard. Each unit one parking lot. The main gate operated by remote. The house door operated by code. Somehow I don't feel safe with that kind of door. Me old fashion.  
 

I am looking at more of the East Coast area. Saw a few developments. Don't like the balconies and the price also out of my reach.

One project that i am particually interested in is the Sandiland.. its located at 3 sandiland road, a 20-25 unit private apartment, no security guard, gate open using remote, door using card scan (the tech quite impressive).. quite like the apartment especially when its at the top of a slope where you really get clear view ... 
 

downside is ... its in the mid of those private estates and its quite far to walk to the train station with all the up slopes and down slopes...



 

I'm staying nearby in one of those small development. It is really cosy and nice area. Location is not much of a hassle if you drive. And the best thing is , at night you can sit at your balcony looking over the whole peaceful estate with no noisy traffic, kids playing downstair etc.

Really depends on how the finacing deal is being structured.... Typically the bank would have it in their covenant that X% of the total units must be sold at a price not below $Ypsf when the project is Z% completed and the sales proceed at this stage would have covered their construction cost which in terms would have covered the bank financing amount (assuming the developer is getting a construction loan). Hence there usually is no need for a project to be fully sold out for the bank to be covered.



 

Not everyone is savvy mah...so simplify example easier for general TCSS reading.

If x & y and then z plus covenant (some will think of WoW or Halo), some catch no ball.
 

But a gd explanation for those who like their XYZs

there is a couple of other small projects around that area.. those with only 20 to 30 units, small swimming pool and a small bbq pit on top.. what do you think of these project.
 

its somethng that suits me as i don't like living with a lot of pple under a fenced area and the pricing is quite attractive to me personally... 800 plus psf for freehold...



 

First off, I am not ppty expert. I happen to hv a keen interest bec my parents dabble in ppty and I get dragged to ppty viewing as a kid. I am also looking ard.
 

My comments reflect how I interpret what I see.
 

If you want to buy a ppty, it has to be something you like but for those stepping into pte ppty from the relative comfort (financing wise) of your hdb flat shd consider their point of entry carefully. 
 

The spanking new condo usually means a substantial loan at a premium to valuation in the same locality, esp when the mkt is bullish.
 

If you are not in a hurry or pressing need, it may not hurt to look ard. 2010+2011 will be the litmus test with the supply coming in and the IR effect is overplayed. The IR only benefits the ppty in the Marina/ Shenton area directly. 
 

Most of the service pple working in the IR are likely to be lower paid FTs in service line (sg talents cannot serve pple even if their lives depended on it) so are we expecting these FTs to afford condo rental? (Possible if you convert your unit ala Grangeford Hostels and expect authorities to come knocking as well)
 

The only driver is if the PR application approved is increased (by a lot) to allow more middle class type of FTs into Singapore, this will allow prices to be supported but the downside is more competition for the middle class jobs. (kind of inevitable in the near future, if u ask me) There are a lot of talented middle class folks in Asia who would jump at the chance to make Singapore their home.
 

Personally, I prefer 200-300 unit development (if I can afford one). Not too crowded and not so small that replacement costs for facilities are going to make you lose your pants.

thats 1 concern too.. but with the low number of pple living there, the chances of it happening will be lower too .. this is my thought as i have never bought a private apartment before. 

and for the potential growth, what do you think? my plan is to achieve long term stay plus investment growth. possible?
 

i was told by my colleague that never go for small scale projects, always go for those projects by BIG companies like Far east .. is this true?

but i notice these BIG companies project comes with BIG pricing too..



 

Sometimes, it makes more sense to look at older developments in the vicinity that are asking for a more reasonable psf. 
 

The ridiculous amount of bay window and sometimes, balconies means your liveable area is not the what the glossy brochure says.
 

The authorities did everyone a disservice when they decided they wanted a cut of the ppty developer's margin when they made bay windows/ planter area parf of the GFA. 
 

They shd have just disallowed the inclusion of such areas from being used and enforced them in the sales literature as well.
 

Now every mxxfxxking project features so much useless space and the bedroom size is probably comfortable only for Frodo and Sam to have a good romp in. Gandalf would have to wait outside.

for older developments, it will be good to know the sinking fund as well the share ratio of the unit.
 

Also i think the litmus test will only be in 2010 and not 2011 because, last heard there is no new projects for next year except for 1 project in serangoon.

just a quick read through to know more why there are soo many bay windows, planter space in all new dev
 

Developers appeal to Govt over bay window ruling
 

By Jessica Cheam
 

They might look innocuous, but bay windows and planter boxes have become a hot topic of discussion between property developers and the Government.
 

The talks centre on a controversial decision by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) to include the area of such design features in gross floor area (GFA) calculations.
 

Bay window and planter boxes, which often make up about 5 per cent of a condo's saleable area, used to be exempt from GFA calculations. But buyers paid developers for this area as it was provided with the unit.
 

The URA caught the industry by surprise on July 7 when it stated that the revised guidelines would take effect from Oct 7. It was reported at the time that the move would close a 'loophole' that developers had been exploiting.
 

Planter boxes were originally introduced to provide greenery and visual relief to high-rise condos.
 

However, the URA said feedback and its own investigations found extensive unauthorised conversions of planter boxes into balcony space or extensions of the living room - which defeated the original purpose.
 

This also led to the buildings being less energy efficient, said the URA.
 

But developers said yesterday it was a 'misconception' that they were profiting from it.
 

UOL Group chief operating officer Liam Wee Sin told The Straits Times that contrary to general perception, developers did not 'have it free'.
 

'There's a reason why it's there in the first place,' he said. 'It costs money to construct these features, and it is not given to us free.'
 

It is part of the 'residual land value' and developers factor this when bidding for a site, he said.
 

A Lianhe Zaobao report quoted market sources who suggested the change might lead developers to pay less for land.
 

It cited the sale of a site next to Tanah Merah MRT station that was awarded recently at $282 per sq ft per plot ratio (psf ppr). This was 11 per cent less than the $318.50 psf ppr attained by a neighbouring site before the GFA change was announced.
 

The president of the Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore (Redas), Mr Simon Cheong, said he could not comment further because talks were 'in process'.
 

Mr Cheong, who was speaking at Redas' annual Mid-Autumn Festival celebration, said that developers were cautious in their short-term outlook due to high construction costs.
 

'Hopefully in 12 months' time, we'll be in a better state than now,' he said.
 

He cited Singapore's low interest rates and upcoming events such as the Formula One race and Youth Olympics for his bullish outlook.
 

On the price of real estate, he said that 'if it drops, it will not be much more'.
 

The replacement cost of apartments, including cost of construction, is very close to selling prices already, he added.
 

Mass market home prices are dependent on local demand and 'this is subjective to how the economy is'.

thanks for all long essay. really appreciate that.
 

i am not going to commit myself in the next 1-2 yrs as my mind is telling me that the price will drop further downwards, with the economy now looking really weird nowadays. will be selling off my HDB this coming month and move back to stay with my parent.

What do you guys think about buying a unit with tenancy? Is it a selling point if the rental can achieve 5% or more yield?



 
 

5% is a average rental yield, nothing bad, nothing fantastic.
 

Also must take into consideration is the property itself, and when is the tenancy contracted. 
 

E.g june 09 and june 08 pricing theres a big difference.
 

if it was a old tenant e.g 08 june pricing which was the peak means the potential for that place isnt too great.
 

if 09 june which is considered inside the recession, that would be the lowest you can get.
 

also have to consider if theres any potential in the area, MRT/ Schools and stuff that would get people excited.
 

Overall consider the whole picture, rental yield is just one of the many things to be taken into consideration.
 

Hope that helped:)

The developers only provide visible pipeline till end 2010. The 2011 picture will be clearer when we get to 2010. 
 

After all, if they really do not launch more projects in 2011, it could mean 2010 was a really bad year where the oversupply backlog will be carried over to 2011.

It is not so much of small or big developers but more of track record... If it is a first time developer, then maybe need to be very cautious but those with a proven track record though small should be pretty ok.... 
 

Unfortunately for big projects, due to its sheer size & volume are mainly undertaken by so-called BIG developers (or even JV between a few big players) because the banks financing these deals also want to make sure they are lending to people that supposedly know what they are doing...

Just trying to make myself sound a lot more intellectual than what I really am..... 
 

Actually even before launching the project, the developer would have gotten the commitment from their investors to commit to a certain number of units at a pre-determined price. So these investors will issue an option to the developer in which the developer can call upon in case if they cannot sell enough units to meet their banker's requirements.

Hi SoFarSoGood,
 

Like Jlyb86 said, a rental yield of 5% is relatively good as average rental yield is usually 3-4% :)
 

I'm in the property line and I have some projects on hand with rental yield as high as 4.9% but prices keep fluctuating and trend is going up, if you were to delay the purchase from now, rental yield may not be as high as expected.
 

Btw you will also have to look into items such as capital appreciation, as this is one key component to consider when you purchase your property. Hope this helps :)
 

If you would like to find out more, give me a pm or sms, I'll see how I can help you out.

if the rental yield of 5% was obtained in the last 12 months, sound like a good deal to me.
 

solely from a yield perspective, I would hazard a guess that the location of the unit is quite good.

Like Jlyb86 said, a rental yield of 5% is relatively good as average rental yield is usually 3-4% :)



 

Actually, Jlyb86 said 5% yield was average! 
 

The current market situation is such that, I find it hard to swallow any of the prices being touted.
 

The current thinking is that Singapore will soon be invaded by the Japanese again as there is a plethora of pathetically small "apartments" being built and sold! The reason is due mainly to the perceived low price.
 

The Sail, for example, 600 sqft units are being rented out at $3000 per month, yet they are being sold at $1.1mln.
 

This equates to a rental yield of 3.3%, and that's IF they can rent it out at that price, I have three friends staying in those units, one is renting at 2.4k, another at 2.5 and the loser is renting at 2.8k. So that brings the yield down further.
 

Although prices are not at their stupid highs of 2007, they are still at unrealistic highs, I've shortlisted a few places I would like to buy, but I will wait for the prices to meet my expectations first.

Yup Bro Blueray rental yield of 5% is indeed good and I have calculated that Ascentia Sky as some of the bros here are looking at is able to achieve close to that yield at 4.9%
 

Actually bro SoFarSoGood I would advise that when buying a property, do a comparison of developments in the same locality as a yardstick as some bros here have mentioned, this will help determine your capital appreciation :)
 

Now would be an ideal time to buy, as we've already missed the boat to rock bottom prices during the 1st half of the yr. Prices are going up trend with developers rapidly raising the prices with the strength of buyer's sentiments for the past few months. Also you can capitalize on the low interest rates as it can help you save hundreds of thousands. Having a relatively high rental yield can also ensure a good stream of recurring income annually and will help you mitigate your investment risks as well.
 

Hope this will help some buyers here to facilitate their decision making process :) cheers!

if it is purely base on rental yield.
 

consider COMMERCIAL property.
 

i dealt a couple of conservative shophouses, office and trust me when i say that 5% is only the average :)
 

The only thing is the mindset because given a choice we would wanna tell people we know we invest in <insert high end prestigious condo name here>
 

Rather than i own a warehouse in gul circle :)

I've always been interested whether agents can sign these kind of statements in black and white.
 

Let's take this unit for example at the yet to be built Ascentia Sky :
 

2 bedroom @ SGD$1,200,000
 

So at 1.2mln, to achieve 4.9% yield, a quick calculation would result in a monthly rental of $4900, and this does not include deductions for monthly maintenance fees (which is usually borne by the landlord).
 

Doesn't sound too bad? Well, there are similarly sized 3 bedroom units at The Sail going for $5000 a month (and you can probably drive those rates down).
 

So back to you Celeste, how do you justify a 4.9% yield, I'm just curious.

Doubt agents will sign as this is projected yield, same thing as bank investment stuff rates. Contract will just add in those small liners that no one really wants to read. 
 

Alot of stuff are really based on marketing and perceptions. And to be honest the IR is a overused sales pitch.
 

A high priced development dont really guarantee high rental yield, it just makes it easier to sell.
 

A condo brought for 700k in geylang renting at 3k/mth generates 5.1% 
 

It is easier to get a better yield by buying low (no brainer)

Btw Carndablues, buying an investment is not just abt the rental yield many other factors come into play as well. 
 

Most ppl would like to look at capital appreciation which I gathered The Sail at Marina Bay could bring high returns, buy low sell high.
 

Like Jlyb86 mentioned, its a no brainer.
 

For your rental rate of 2.3-2.8k you mentioned, I'm not too sure how long ago was that as rental prices changes with the mkt, right now The Sail 2+1 asking for $6K, and 1room which I presume your friends are renting out right now is asking for 3600, which is quite a vast difference from the figures you mentioned.
 

perhaps 2.3k could set you back on a utilities room currently?

All rented in Feb - April this year, and you should really try marketing a place at The Sail at current prices, I can tell you, no one is interested.
 

A lot of the studio apartments the Sail was built for was meant for the "lower class" workers of the Finance sector, the IT/Accounting/HR support functions, not the high-paying frontline roles.
 

These functions have either moved out of Singapore all together or they have relocated to cheaper parts of Singapore, Chai Chee and Harbourfront are two that spring to mind.
 

Each time I visit them, I can't help but to think how empty the whole development is, it's difficult to find another resident!
 

So by all means, if you are so confident that the rental at The Sail is on the up, up, up (which they are) and that the renters are on the in, in, in, why don't you just set up camp there and the money will surely roll in, surely!
 

Moron agent!

And I do not know if your speculations on the reallocation on the different support functions and empty units is based on statistics or personal beliefs but I do know this is the current mkt rental rates.
 

Pls do not get so worked up as we are all sharing information over a common forum so I can only share what I have collected being an agent all these time and hope you can refrain from such derogatory comments thanks.

5% is really higher in today terms. Most million dollar property can only fetch about 4k/mth. and after deducting all the oo eh boh eh like maintenance & tax, maybe 3.5k only giving about 4% returns.
 

If you take a bank loan, lagi jialat. The aim is to only cover the interest bit and hope for capital apprecaition

You're not a moron, that was wrong, just a liar, quickly changing your tune from 4.9% to 3.9% when I referenced some facts, for example. What else could you be lying about, sorry, "miscalculating"?

Frankly if he is really an agent that he claims to be, then he should be    for sharing his so-called "info"...
 

Not entirely sure of his exact intent but then again, he might know some "info" that we mere mortals do not know.... so maybe we should really kow-tow to him instead for enlightening all of us...

I'm trying to paint realism into your otherwise over-optimistic picture. 
 

You're not a moron, that was wrong, just a liar, quickly changing your tune from 4.9% to 3.9% when I referenced some facts, for example. What else could you be lying about, sorry, "miscalculating"?



 

People already say "Typo"... so we must learn to be more forgiving mah....

I love to hear your rants against over bullish postings...  



 

Actually, I really think the current cycle will mirror the '96-'01 but not as steep. 
 

So there may still be some slight upside but any significant appreciation, buyers will sit out and this time, there may not be so many "pent-up" demand if prices do drop back to today's levels.

Hi Carndablues typo should be 3.9% 
 

Rental Yield
 

Btw 3-4% is considered average



 

As I already said many times, but ppl just don't seem to get it...getting any thing less than 10% or more from your investments...you better put your money under your pillow! ( some had earlier suggested a Milo tin..)

Talking abt rental yield..
 

Assumming you take a 800k loan , yearly interest is ave 40k which is ard 3.3k mthly interest alone.

If you cannot rent out your property for < 4k, there is no rental yield to talk abt in the first place. Cos' you just simply paying for ppl to live in your house, considering the depreciation that goes with it and the monthly maintenace.
 

and now the rental market is really really bad.. You can get a new condo unit with 2k .. if you dun mind the location.

Mine is rough est. lah.. assume interest is average at 5% .. interest to a 800k loan is ~40k ? 

No lah.. if you take a 800k loan for 30 yrs, only ard ~5k per mth... 3+k goes to interest. 2k to principle.

just went to this project launch over the weekend ... packed full of pple..
 

just quite puzzled... project is on 99 yrs lease but its selling somewhere at 1300 psf... but another project, which is a apartment (not with fully condo fac) down the street with freehold, going for 800 plus psf... how come this project is priced so much higher?



 

Buy condo in Sg number 1 rule: Never buy from developer Near West :-) Who else advertises on TV, and who eventually pays for the ads???

Property market crazy now. Just came back from Meadows@Pierce Reservoir. Already asking close to 1000psf for that kinda location. Furthermore, no MRT, amenities nearby, good schools. Selling point is probably lots of greenery. Kinda reminds me of FIBUA. haha

Sinkie Land is a bandwagon FULL of shxt...when the driver who is holding all the peasant's money make it look like the wagon is stable and is still pulling up the hill...the Sinkies will jump onto it! 
 

What would happen if more and more Sinkie and FTs jump onto the wagon ( which had leak/lost almost half of the fuel away) and the wagon is goping up hill?
 

YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD AS MINE!
