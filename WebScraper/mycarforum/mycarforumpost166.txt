these apartments are closed to MRT- Buangkok mrt (aka White elephant mrt if you remember the case). It is just right at the door step (less than 200m). Facilities wise, ok only as they have coffee shop, 24 hours NTUC, childcare centres etc. This is just opposite the current "Jewel" condo.
 

they have basement caparks (but insufficient carpark space) and are considered premium flats (all electrical wiring conceal nicely just like condo). dunno if it is worth that price but the stats shows that people are willing to pay.

i can tell u. very few people want to stay in woodlands. even among hdb dwellers. 

This is among aunty/uncle and quite pervasive.

even if they stay in sembawang or yewtee or what, they will not stay in woodlands.

you are against them living in studio or against them locked door???
 

anyway if you are refering to HDB Dual key. not possible too as studio apartment is still under parents name. so they only pay their portion. unless parents use the extra cash to pay for son unit.

because the additional $100k and 25-30 years loan interest is bei tahan !!!
 

similarly, those can afford $700k, why not push to $800k for better unit if there is
 

similarly, buying 99LH condo ... the larger the unit the lower the $psf but the absolute amount is siao ie: additional 1 room = add $100k

smaller flats were in demand more than big units

in fact, hdb was still clearing EAs in woodlands and sembawang around 2003 / 2004

4 room still has 3 bed rooms. just a small living room only.

I can see why it's attractive to most couples.
 

But nowadays the 4rms are bit small.

I personally think 5rms make the most sense.

Maybe nowadays most are small family which 4 room is enough. Esp if you buy resale 4 room, the size quite big. buying bigger flat like 5 room or more, later more difficult to sell off.

All the while 5 room only have 3 bedroom, right? But last time 5 room flat floor area bigger, the bedrooms, living room, dining room are big, and also comes with a balcony. Only if you buy EA than comes with 4 bedroom. But there was one time they built 5 rooms with 3 bedroom plus one study room and one balcony.

Khaw is right. Under-table payment will be rampant. To really counter this ever climbing asset enhancement is really the land cost. However, the hole has been dug so deep liao, how to unravel? Cannot imagine how many will become the non-flyable superman. His only solution i think is to hold the price stagnant for as long as possible. 
 

Of course the question will be who causes all these shits to happen? Well its everyone's answer.

expensive = good. 
 

Buy 800K condo = no face
 

Buy 1.3m condo (same one or better still, smaller one) = got face

sometimes depends on number of transactions in that cluster.
 

like my place, transaction price is much lower than the surrounding clusters even though location is better with good ammenties.
 

but once someone is able to secure a high selling price, subsequent evaluations will take that as a benchmark and just go higher.

huh? beisde MRT station ? these are not Aspella /Atrina  but Coris .. which is still some distance away 
 

see map below of one of the top prize 
 

https://maps.google.com/maps?q=273D+Compass...mp;t=m&z=16
 
 
 

 true but HDB cannot sell one .. once lifetime only can get 2x brand new ...and during these lifetime if breach the ceiling totally cannot get new so must die die also keep 
 
 
 

not oppposte MRT still some quite some distance away ...those near MRT or on top of MRT still haben reach their MOP 
 
 
 

i saw on paper advertisement ... not more than 800K leh



 

275 is practically on top of the MRT. The rest are about 3mins walk away. Not a bad neighbourhood to stay as long as your units aren't facing the other blocks but the area in-between.
 

The 2 bedders you saw are shoebox ones. They're tiny. Don't look at the quantum price. The psf price is more important.

Buy 1.3m condo (same one or better still, smaller one) = got face

Punggol EC Ecopolitian going for selection today and on average price is 800psf.

A std 3 bedded mid floor can cost about to 900k, the location is abt 600m to MRT.

Heard the finishing is so-so, cost cutting very obvious.

Rmb Flo residence n River isle on average pricing was 830psf with better finishing, that's make this new EC looks very ex.

With the current MAS control, dunno these first timer EC buyers can receive how much of approved bank loan amount?

$900K EC target at $12K household income ... simi logic???
 

aren't the govt ask the people to be prudence and buy within their means

then build $900K a unit for a household with $12K income
 

some will argue their income will rise 

cost of living will also rise ... have not factor in interest yet which is smelly smelly $400k for 25 years loan, cost to raise children, maid, look after aging parent, etc etc

New MAS regulations shouldn't affect first time EC buyers much because they will have no existing loan. Only those with multiple loans are going to be affected.

12k income can easily pay for a 900k EC with just their CPF OA and maybe a very slight top up. The danger is only loss of income or loss of work.
 

Even if interest rates rise substantially, they should still be able to fork up the cash top up. But yes, it might be painful.

young that time said $900k ec sibei affordable using cpf oa + slight top up nia ... sup sup water

any home (roof over own head, not investment) should be fully paid in less than 10 years ... international affordability standard is 5 years. 

else cpf is KOSONG at retiring age .... sibei kopi-o kosong ... bitter to the max

the "noble" cause for EC is to provide a upgrade path for sporean to upgrade from hdb to ec ... since many kaypoh kaypoh say PC is expensive and cannot afford
 

1. EC is for uprader ... ie: sell hdb at 450K ... buy ec at $900k ... balance is only $450k ... somemore the hdb must be fully paid hor

2. EC is for people with $$$ in the bank who is capable to redeem the EC in less than 10 years ... ie: at the age 25-30 is manager, at the age of 35-40 is director/regional level liao 
 

those who can only afford 20% downpayment and take $720K loan (+ another $350k interest) and expect to fully paid in 25-30 years loan period can kiss goodbye to their cpf retirement.

and the govt answer to that is either downgrade (sell, cash out and must move to cheaper housing) or rent out rooms to sustain your retirement

fail to do so ... then cry papa cry mama ... old liao ... cpf no money ... must q for hours in polyclinic to treat fever and flu

so ... we must have "new buyer" to come in to buy the old $900K ec ... else who is going to buy if every sporean got their EC when 25-30 and thinking to sell at 55-60 to cash out?

if there were no PR to buy the $450-$500k hdb ... how hdb upgrader buy ec?
 

when a family start to mature ie: got married > children > maid > car > expensive holiday > etc ... expenses rise 50% but income do not rise in the same speed
 




Housing loan fully paid in 10 years !!!! Wait a min ..HDB flat possible but not EC or condo ... 

900k condo before interest ...down payment 20% balance 720k that is 6k per month before interest ... CPF assuming Max cpf $2k ...dun add the employer portion ...  Still need cash $4k... For $12k couple after CPF .. $10k less $4k hmm sound doable leh ... Where did the sum go wrong hmm

cant be woh ... where can one find EA at less than $300K 10 years ago



 

you must have bought your EA during the walk in selection
 

when there was oversupply in the estate 7-10 years back
 

HDB even did an actual showflat in one of the blocks
 

must thank MBT who overbuilt that time

the "noble" cause for EC is to provide a upgrade path for sporean to upgrade from hdb to ec ... since many kaypoh kaypoh say PC is expensive and cannot afford
 

1. EC is for uprader ... ie: sell hdb at 450K ... buy ec at $900k ... balance is only $450k ... somemore the hdb must be fully paid hor

2. EC is for people with $$$ in the bank who is capable to redeem the EC in less than 10 years ... ie: at the age 25-30 is manager, at the age of 35-40 is director/regional level liao 
 

those who can only afford 20% downpayment and take $720K loan (+ another $350k interest) and expect to fully paid in 25-30 years loan period can kiss goodbye to their cpf retirement.

and the govt answer to that is either downgrade (sell, cash out and must move to cheaper housing) or rent out rooms to sustain your retirement

fail to do so ... then cry papa cry mama ... old liao ... cpf no money ... must q for hours in polyclinic to treat fever and flu

so ... we must have "new buyer" to come in to buy the old $900K ec ... else who is going to buy if every sporean got their EC when 25-30 and thinking to sell at 55-60 to cash out?

if there were no PR to buy the $450-$500k hdb ... how hdb upgrader buy ec?
 

when a family start to mature ie: got married > children > maid > car > expensive holiday > etc ... expenses rise 50% but income do not rise in the same speed



 

If everyone can think like you, there won't be a craze over "upgrading".

thats a bad card not trump card. We r already 5.6M, 6.9M will be reached within 10yrs, so after that wat happens? Lots of pple complain abt 6.9M too many pple, but yet want their prop price to go up alot forever. Delusional.

Yes, delusional. They want population to stop at 5.6M, want property prices to come down so that they collect their 2nd or 3rd one cheaply, but expect high rental to remain, value continue to appreciate...

Yah, at 5.6M we are already struggling with pathetic 2-3% GDP. When we reach 6.9M, we may be struggling with 1-2% GDP, who knows. Then they will push the limit higher, 8.5M and so on...

buy at age 25-30, take 25-30 years loan

by age 55-60 then kaypoh cpf no money ... blame sky blame earth blame govt

young that time said $900k ec sibei affordable using cpf oa + slight top up nia ... sup sup water

any home (roof over own head, not investment) should be fully paid in less than 10 years ... international affordability standard is 5 years. 

else cpf is KOSONG at retiring age .... sibei kopi-o kosong ... bitter to the max



 

i do reverse,buy cheap cheap by 37 can finish liao..
 

no work now cpf also can last 10years to service the loan if choose not to clear

yap. this is the way to go. my calculation is if no increment, my housing also must be able to finish within 10 years. with normal annual 3% increment will take around 7 years. 
 

now i am glad that its going to be shorter 
 

planning within the mean is always good. 
 

dont have to care if you living in Jurong or Tampaness or seng kang or Punggol just live within your mean.
 

but i also wonder why punggol and seng kang which their pricing doesnt show that its a new town.

as a nation matures, population gets more educated, it is only normal for a multi party govt to take over as a single party w a single direction is no longer needed becos pple are smarter and can think better for one self, hv more differing views. tats replying ur MIW statement.
 

ya i agree w ur new mindset. yes the world is much bigger than sg, as we travel more, we see more and can talk more objectively about sg. for me, except GDP numbers, this country has stalled - like in the 80s, we boast the highest quality of life w new and modern HDB, when ah goh say swiss std of living, we believe but now, the others hv caught up and the diff bet tampines and KL or even china 2nd level cities r minimal.

Tokyo possible to live in yokohama & cont to work or take one train and can reconnect w nature, greenery again. if cut cost, hv option to move further suburbs.  
 

to b frank, a lifestyle is only balanced if there is mixture of city, nature n space. by the time 6.9m here, tat balance is going to be challenged again and yes, def more true blue sg wil go.

Newspaper also say cab driver can earn $7k. They say and you believe...




A taxi driver friend told me it is possible, but must be smart in planning the routes and good time management.

Of course can't tahan long lah. 
 

I was just saying the $7K figure is obtainable. But whether each and every individual taxi driver want to achieve it every month is up to them.

Tokyo possible to live in yokohama & cont to work or take one train and can reconnect w nature, greenery again. if cut cost, hv option to move further suburbs.  
 

to b frank, a lifestyle is only balanced if there is mixture of city, nature n space. by the time 6.9m here, tat balance is going to be challenged again and yes, def more true blue sg wil go.



 

I think HDB/URA is doing a pretty good job of estate planning.

Just that overall numbers are challenging ...

when my hubby and i getting new flat ...his projection is 

4room pay off within 1.5 years 

5rm pay off within 3 years 

EA pay off within 5 years 
 

i say he siao  but he has proven that his projection is realistic and correct 



 

I have a different strategy. Since HDB loan is pegged at CPF OA interest rate +0.1%, I keep all the money in OA and wait for suitable time to pick up some shares. The opportunity cost is 0.1% only. Depending on your loan size, it is ~$100-400 per year.

there are 2 way to see it 
 

1) if one is confident investment with return more than enuff to cover interest then no issue 

else 

2) better pay off whatever ... to incur less interest lor 
 

for lousy investors like us ... buy what blue chip and price will go down and nearly heartache ...think better to clear the loan

but if u use it to buy shares, your opp cost is no longer 0.1% as the amount is out of your CPF and not earning the OA interest.

CPF is meant mainly for retirement, but somehow along the way, people minds get muddled and start exploring ways to utilise it and justify the sky high prices of subsidised housing.

Am I missing something? 
 

Assuming one couple start working at 25, CPF starts from zero. 
 

Assuming max CPF contribution from day 1, the max CPF contribution to OA is $2K/mth. 
 

To pay off 300K loan without using cash, the couple have to work 150 months, or equal to 12.5 yrs.

You forgot bonus. Bonus also have CPF contribution.
 

Assuming contribution from bonus is 3k/pax on average, every year will have $30000 in OA account.
 

So should need only 10 years only.

that is the thing...why start work at 25 ? not everyone get to go Uni and can start to get into workforce early and start the cpf accumulation early ...and dun forget got bonus and employer portion to up the amount also like mentioned earlier need to top up cash too

My assumptions are based on max CPF contribution from day 1 of work life. That is $5K salary per mth. Again, those who didn't study Uni may have early head start, but how many can hit this salary right from day 1? 
 

As for bonus? Maybe this will play a bit of difference, but not much lah. How many companies are paying >6 mths bonus these days? 
 

So i'm still very surprise to hear ppl paying 300K loan is like chicken feet. Am I missing something?

I was in similar situation like u, thought it was jia liat and have to take 30ys to clear my loan. But I manage to clear it before that thru lump sum payment. But to clear a 300K loan in 5 yrs? No way lah. Unless i got external help or use cash in.

I made a calculation before base on household income, if you are above 6K. you should have no problem paying 300K loan in 15~20 years just using CPF alone. 
 

but that does not mean it is affordable as not many people have combine income of 6K.

still have time to accumulate $$ in OA after loan, 
 

not forgetting SA is always accumulating without any outflow
 

but the trouble is nowadays, new flats are 400K -600K?

300k loan financed by CPF OA in 10-15 years is ok.  
 

still have time to accumulate $$ in OA after loan, 
 

not forgetting SA is always accumulating without any outflow
 

but the trouble is nowadays, new flats are 400K -600K?
 

btw i don't believe in using cash for HDB.  I have better uses for cash
 





 

Diff pple has diff way of managing finance ... Whichever works for you by all means 
 

Yah damn exp now ... Even for public housing .. Thanks goodness we bought ours early haha

can save on insurance and interest payments
 

owe your own CPF account better than pay extra interest on the HDB 
 

every cent counts you know

insurance also pay by CPF.
 

if say touch wood, you pass away then wife and kids get the house for free. 
 

do note that if you pay off all. in 10 years after you pay the CPF. you own CPF 30% of your loan amount meaning your house if you sell better be 30% more expensive then when you take the loan

i am ah huat remember. 
 

my english is really lousy one. 
 

actually simply lah.
 

say we have to pay CPF for every dollar we take out.
 

say you take 100K full cpf to buy a flat in full. (figure is subjective.) 
 

guess what is the amount of money money you own them after 10 years??
 

for easy calculation we take it as 2.5% every year off 100K. and we dont count interested upon interested. will at least be around 125K liao. minimum.
 

so your flat when you sell.. make sure its more than 125K. if not after selling say for 110K. you still own CPF 15K although you make a earning of 10K.
 

now imagine you sell your house after 20 years?? the income you owned is at least 150K (actual figure should be nearer to 200K).
 

look small right? but out flat are around 300K to 450K. meaing you could be owning the CPF easily more than that.

i think you are refering to the HDB loan interest rate.
 

i made a spreadsheet before but loss it when i quit my job.
 

when you do the comparision. surprisingly, you actually loss less by spending your time to pay off the loan in less than certain amount of years. cannot remember its 15 years or 20 years liao. 
 

but on the long run, for a 150K loan. the different is less than 20K. this is if we are taking HDB loan instead of bank loan.

yes, the interest goes back to the cpf, and watever u sell for, is profit, etc..
 

tt why, i fully paid my hdeebee tt time in 10 yrs.  took 25 yrs first, then every yr, reduce reduce, and song man when clear last payment....
 

every reduction is 5 yrs, they recalculate for you and use any balance to straight away offset, then reloan.

For those taking HDB loan, it is better to stretch your loan to the full tenure. Pay as slowly as you can and DO NOT lump sum your money. Why? 
 

1)HDB loan rate and CPF ordinary rate differ by just 0.1% as mention.
 

2)with excess inside the ordinary account,it can help you tide over difficult period without coughing out cash for monthly instalment (when you get retrenched).
 

3)with excess money in ordinary account, you can use it to upgrade to a better home as money left over can be use as part of the down payment.
 

4)first 60k in the CPF earns you 1% more interest at the moment, so it is actually better to have up to 20k inside your ordinary account.

Yeah. But that is why he is freestyle I am j22. Different style

Anyway. To add on. The 2.6% is ever decreasing while the 2.5% is always increasing so the margine over 30 years is lesser than 0.1% but only slightly.

if you loan from CPF to buy shares, i though we only need to return the number plus interest incur. which is current 2.4% (or was it 2.5%)???



 

buy shares no need to return the interest. only use to buy ppty, then need to return the 2.5% interest when sell. 

if goalpost change again pls feel free to correct.

Am I missing something? 
 

Assuming one couple start working at 25, CPF starts from zero. 
 

Assuming max CPF contribution from day 1, the max CPF contribution to OA is $2K/mth. 
 

To pay off 300K loan without using cash, the couple have to work 150 months, or equal to 12.5 yrs.



 
 

hello
 

like what others pointed out....
 

not every one so gd life... can live off parents until 25.... 

yes bonus is one thing....
 

furthermore... there are grants.... that can offset some of the payments...
 

and there is always cash..... 
 
 

i know of someone who bought a flat ard 150k... paid full using CPF and grants...
 

now that couple has a sizeable amount in CPF after 5 yrs... if the house was 300k... will be paid off liao...

For those taking HDB loan, it is better to stretch your loan to the full tenure. Pay as slowly as you can and DO NOT lump sum your money. Why? 
 

1)HDB loan rate and CPF ordinary rate differ by just 0.1% as mention.
 

2)with excess inside the ordinary account,it can help you tide over difficult period without coughing out cash for monthly instalment (when you get retrenched).
 

3)with excess money in ordinary account, you can use it to upgrade to a better home as money left over can be use as part of the down payment.
 

4)first 60k in the CPF earns you 1% more interest at the moment, so it is actually better to have up to 20k inside your ordinary account.



 

yup

Not forgetting the compulsory insurance if you use CPF. If kaput, the insurance will cover all the balance payment.

No need female to provide to talk Liao Lolz 
 

I notice a typical trend here ... All Saving for 2nd property Before clearing existing loan with CPF Lolz



 

If i want to take a 2nd loan for property. Assuming PC as 2nd loan. HDB BTO as 1st loan.

What i will do is pay in cash to CPF to clear the loan + outstanding interest. 

Then i can use 100% of my OA to pay for my 2nd property downpayment. Instead of having the very restrictive 2nd loan minimum sum requirement limits.

dun get it... so for a $1m property... you going to use your cash of $200k to pay off CPF then use OA to pay the downpayment... and you can bypass the restrictive 2nd loan min sum requirement ... izzt ...1st time heard this method... my impression is regardless whether pay off or no pay off...as long as it is 2nd property... need to meet min sum already but of course got loopholes too

It's not 2nd property. Once u pay off CPF entirely for every single cent of ur 1st loan ie equivalent to using 100% cash for ur 1st loan. Then u maximise ur OA and use it for your 2nd loan...
 

It only makes sense if u have a small 1st loan with CPF. and going to take a much larger loan for ur 2nd property. And also if u did not fully utilise your OA for your 1st BTO.
 

Cos the 2nd loan restriction on a couple's OA was cant touch 2 x 60k (now i think its more like 70+k already and the amount is still increasing...). So it's more than 140k sitting that u cant even touch (of course provided ur OA has that much $).

Yes, you may use your CPF to purchase more than one property. 

However, if you already own a property (HDB flat or private property) bought with your CPF savings and wish to buy another property with CPF savings after 1 July 2006, you must set aside half of the prevailing Minimum Sum before you can use the excess savings in your Ordinary Account for the second/subsequent property.  Savings in the Special Account (including the amount used for investments) and Ordinary Account can be used to meet this required amount.
 

Please note that as the Minimum Sum will be raised in July each year, the amount you need to set aside will be adjusted accordingly.  Please click here for more details.
 

If you currently own more than one property bought with CPF savings before 1 July 2006, you need not set aside half of the prevailing Minimum Sum unless you subsequently buy another property using your CPF savings on or after 1 July 2006.
 

Please note that this is not applicable if you are applying to use your CPF to purchase a second or subsequent property with non-related singles.  Non-related singles can only jointly use their CPF to purchase one property (HDB flat or private property).

yes, use SA to meet half the min sum.  
 

Anyway it cannot be touched and earns good interest of 4%.

agreed totally, Jepun is a big country where worker commune via subway train daily, we do not have terrain and landscape like them, a mixture, given time URA architecture will come out similar outfit copycat.
 

I can't wait _ i like a mixture if Korea and Jepun , an integrated SingKoreaJepun nation. 



 

URA wont do it la...to gahmen, LAND is to be sold for money. Like when they opened Gardens by the bay and compared it to Central Park, Hyde Park, I was like  

I think bedok reservoir serves the need for nature better for us locals.

There are reasons why the transactions for 4 room there are high. Even the 5 room at 268x to 269x are high too. Firstly it is near MRT and amenities. The flats there are all premium flats offering basement car parks except 270/271x. Exterior design looks like condo. KPE is just mins away. And of course it's just 5 years old. 
 

But with plus points there are minus points. Firstly there isn't enough bus services. Only bus number 27 and 43. This maybe inconvenient for others. 2ndly the shops there are controlled and run by kopitiam, which means chances of having McDonald's and KFC are slim. And then the 4 room is only 90 sqm and good enough for a family of 4. Anything more will be a bit of a squeeze.

Cov drop, good luck to ec upgraders

SINGAPORE: The overall cash premium, or Cash-Over-Valuation (COV), that buyers pay for HDB resale flats has dropped to its lowest in about two and a half years. 

This is according to data from major property agencies compiled by the Singapore Real Estate Exchange (SRX)
 

Overall HDB COV dropped S$4,000 in July from June to reach S$20,000 -- the lowest since January 2011.
 

This is compared to the peak of S$35,000 recorded in January this year.
 

SRX said overall  COV has dropped by 43 per cent  year-to-date.
 

This comes on the back of a 0.5-per-cent dip on overall HDB resale prices, marking the third consecutive monthly drop in HDB resale prices.
 

Christine Li, head of research & consultancy at property consultancy firm OrangeTee, said: "The drop in COV is expected. After the government imposed the mortgage servicing ratio on HDB loans, we do see some buyers staying away from the bigger HDB flats because their loan quantum is affected. As a result, that will affect their ability to pay for high COVs."
 

SRX said HDB resale volume remained relatively flat in July compared to June, with about 1,270 resale transactions recorded.
 

Year-on-year, July's resale volume represented a 36-per-cent drop from the same period in 2012.
 

An estimated 1,760 HDB flats were rented in July, up by 13 per cent compared to June. This number also exceeded the 1,632 HDB rental transactions in July last year.
 

Meanwhile, resale prices of non-landed private homes rose marginally by 0.1 per cent in July, compared to the 0.8-per-cent increase in June.
 

This was led by the 1.2-per-cent price gain seen in the city fringes.
 

Resale prices of non-landed private homes in the city region fell 0.5 per cent while those in the suburban areas slipped 0.4 per cent.
 

An estimated 670 non-landed private homes were transacted in July, compared to 640 units in June.
 

Overall rental prices for non-landed private residential in July inched upwards by 0.2 per cent from June, reversing the drop in the past three months.
 

On a regional basis, rental prices in the city region gained 1.4 per cent. Rentals in the city fringes fell 0.9 per cent while suburban rentals declined 0.4 per cent.

Changing to 4 bedroom EC. Luckily I can afford a bit of space for them. Actually even if cant afford then just stay put lor. A house is just a shelter against the elements, it's the ppl inside that makes a home. Ppl can grow up in bungalow n be estranged from each other, or grow up in a 1 room squeezy flat n be close n loving. I think as a ppl we SGeans r just too focused on the material things like a house n neglecting intangible things like the home.

 Yah, HDb gotta be half the price of what it is now yet, people continue to buy at high prices, fail to heed signals and write themselves to debt.  All becos the agent "help" the seller to push price up and later also "help" advise the buyer to quickly buy before the price go higher.

Its the other way round lah.....HDb is low low down the chain, of course impact overlaps but it is not the leading factor its a resulting one.
 

To me,

HDB must be cheap.

It must not be used for profiteering

It must not be used for renting out

It must be the right of every Singapore to buy one.

hey bro ... unfortunately, the current message is the reverse
 

HDB must be valuable (aka not cheap) - this is part of the so called "rooting" process so that people feel rich to own a property

It's value appreciates over time as part of asset enhancement

It's part of retirement tool ... old already rent out rooms for passive income

If don't allow PR to buy ... who is going to pay a premium for the resale flat ... then how Sporean can upgrade to EC or PC

It's like " oh it's great news that property prise rise again, but average singaporeans wages still stagnant " . Yes it's good news, but paper value only. For now it's good as sell off will make profit, but don't forget sell high, buy also high. So end up those keep pushing up property price will really put a lot of pressure in average singaporeans which many had already feel it. What happen next?? In future still keep rising which average singaporeans salaries can't keep pace with it ?? By then when price too costly and there is no demand, good luck to those taking huge loan on property lor.

I think u r too harsh with ordinary ppl...u r blessed with ability to make gd money n blessed with foresight to make wise economic decisions with your money...but primarily it's even possible because of your earning power.
 

If I can, I also wish to buy car in cash, buy houses that I only pay with 10% of my income n still be able to save 50% of my income every month. But it's clearly not possible because I, like many others, lack money-making ability. If want to blame, blame my forefathers for lousy genes, blame myself for laziness n blame God why didn't make me like Warren Buffet :p lol

Its the other way round lah.....HDb is low low down the chain, of course impact overlaps but it is not the leading factor its a resulting one.
 

To me,

HDB must be cheap.

It must not be used for profiteering

It must not be used for renting out

It must be the right of every Singapore to buy one.



 

but our government are run like mnc woah...need to make profit aka deficit in every finance year

just a quick question for those who have rented out their properties, say if your agent found a tenant for you and you paid commission then, upon renewal do you still need the agent to continue with the rental?, do you need to pay full commission for the two years rental? thanks

hey bro ... unfortunately, the current message is the reverse
 

HDB must be valuable (aka not cheap) - this is part of the so called "rooting" process so that people feel rich to own a property

It's value appreciates over time as part of asset enhancement

It's part of retirement tool ... old already rent out rooms for passive income

If don't allow PR to buy ... who is going to pay a premium for the resale flat ... then how Sporean can upgrade to EC or PC



 

Aiyah, thats becos our values have all become topsy turvy already lah.....

Answer is no.
 

I always make sure that in the tenancy agreement , renewal of tenancy is between tenant and landlord, got nothing to do with agent anymore.  
 

Just sign a new tenancy agreement after you nego with tenant on the new rental.

Get it stamped and carry on.

NDP message
 


My fellow Singaporeans,
I am speaking to you from the new SAFRA clubhouse in Toa Payoh. This is where SAFRA built its very first clubhouse in 1975. We have just rebuilt it with better facilities for NSmen and your families. It is a small gesture to thank you for your many contributions and sacrifices. It is also an example of how we are upgrading our amenities and environment as Singapore develops, year by year.

We have made steady progress this past year. We have cleared the queue for HDB flats, stabilised BTO prices and tightened up on property speculation and excessive borrowing. We have added more buses and increased the number of bus routes. We are trying out free early morning MRT rides into the city. We will add more trains to the existing lines. Phase One of the Downtown Line will open in December, and more MRT lines after that. We also celebrated several successes in the arts and sports, including our LionsXII team winning the Malaysian Super League.

We are tackling longer term issues too, especially marriage and parenthood, as well as population. The White Paper on Population in January provoked strong reactions, but the debate helped us to understand the issues better. We face difficult choices: We need foreign workers to serve our economy and Singaporeans’ needs, and immigrants to make up for our shortfall of babies. But we also worry about crowding and congestion, and maintaining our Singaporean identity. So we are feeling our way forward carefully, conscious both of our needs and our limits, and seeking the best outcome for Singaporeans.

Our economy is holding steady amidst global uncertainties. We are attracting more quality investments. Unemployment remains low. We grew by 2.0 per cent in the first half of 2013, and expect to grow by 2.5 to 3.5 per cent this year, higher than previously expected. Even as we tighten up on foreign workers and immigration, we must maintain investor confidence and keep Singapore open for business.

The world is changing rapidly and unpredictably. Technology is transforming our lives. Societies everywhere feel under pressure: Jobs have become less secure, wages are rising more slowly or even stagnating, families are working harder, and parents worry whether their children will do better than themselves.

Singapore is changing too. The economy is maturing and our population is ageing. Different groups in society now have more diverse and even conflicting interests. Older Singaporeans worry about healthcare and costs of living. Younger ones aspire to wider education opportunities and more affordable homes.

Our road ahead will be different from the road we have travelled. So we must reassess our position, review our direction, and refresh our strategies to thrive in this new world.

In my Message last year, I said that Singapore should always be our best Home, with Heart and Hope. We launched Our Singapore Conversation to define our shared future together. Many have participated actively and passionately. We heard many valuable suggestions. Thank you for taking part in this effort.

Our Singapore Conversation has helped us crystallise what we aspire to: A Singapore which gives its citizens opportunities to succeed and live fulfilling lives. A nation which defines success in many ways, and offers multiple paths to many peaks. A society with safety nets that give people peace of mind. A community where the disadvantaged get help, and those who have done well in turn do more to help others.

We will set goals and work out plans to realise these aspirations. We must match these aspirations against the world we live in – our competition, our opportunities, and our potential as a people.

Today Singapore stands tall internationally. Many countries admire us. Developed countries and emerging economies want to pick up ideas from us. Every citizen gains from our strong Singapore brand – our workers enjoy a premium in wages, and our people studying and working abroad are welcomed and respected.

At the same time, other countries are rapidly progressing and catching up. We must stay ahead of the competition, and maintain our standing in the world.

To succeed under changed circumstances, we must adapt our basic approach to nation building. We must strike a new balance between the roles of the individual, the community and the State.

We must strengthen our sense of community. We need to give greater mutual support to one another – helping the less fortunate in big ways and small; volunteering for causes that we care about; organising ourselves to work for the common good.

We already do this, especially during crises. When dengue and the haze threatened us, we stood together and took care of one another. That is Singapore – not just separate individuals, but a community with a shared purpose and a sense of collective responsibility, taking the initiative to help one another in good times and bad. We need to strengthen this spirit of togetherness.

The Government will also play a bigger role to build a fair and just society. We will do more to enable every Singaporean to succeed, through education and lifelong learning. We will keep avenues to rise wide open to all. We will help those from families with less get off to a good start in life, beginning from pre-school. We will tackle the cost of living, for example healthcare costs, especially for the elderly. We will foster a more equal society, by helping every family afford their own HDB flat, and giving low income workers a better deal through Workfare. In Singapore, everyone will always have a stake in this country, and ample chances to make good in life.

But remember: Each one of us must still do our best, and be self-reliant and resourceful. Because Singapore can only succeed if each one of us contributes his part.

At the same time, all this is only possible if we are one united people, and not divided by race, social class, or political faction. We must always have able, honest and committed leaders, who can be trusted to serve Singaporeans. We need a good Government that thinks and plans ahead, and more importantly feels for our concerns and hopes. That is the way to build a better Singapore – together.

We have come a long way, but our best years are ahead of us. We have the power to shape our destiny and write a new chapter in the Singapore story. Let us stand together, and dedicate ourselves to building in Singapore a brighter future for all.

Happy National Day!

another income/investment opportunity in HDB
 

Huat ah!
 


 

Reit to deal with HDB demand-supply challenges?
 

Singapore
 

ONE day, your neighbour in your public housing estate may be renting his flat from or co-owning it with a real estate investment trust (Reit).
 

A group of academics from the Singapore Management University (SMU) and a noted property consultant are making the case for a Reit comprising Housing and Development Board (HDB) residential and commercial units.
 

SMU professor David Lee is one of the authors of the paper that moots this idea, among others to deal with excess demand in the housing market.
 

"It's just a starting point of a discussion . . . to stimulate some out-of-the-box thinking," he said yesterday. The other authors of the paper are SMU professors Phang Sock Yong and Phoon Kok Fai, SMU researcher Karol Wee, as well as Alan Cheong, head of research at Savills Singapore.
 

The paper noted that the strong demand for public housing, which already has a low vacancy rate, has pushed up HDB rental yields. This coincides with a rising population and an increasing proportion of foreigners who tend to be tenants.
 

Building more is the answer, but this has to be balanced against creating too much supply which may crash the market. A marginal oversupply is optimal, the authors believe, and having an HDB-focused Reit can tackle some of these challenges simultaneously.
 

Here's how the scenario may play out. First, a number of units to be built by HDB will be sold to the Reit, which will put them up for rental. This can help to create a bigger pool of rental units, reducing pressure in that market.
 

"A very simple example, everytime you build a new block, 10 per cent is for rental, so instead of building nine blocks, now you build 10 blocks," Prof Lee said.
 

There can also be an option for the Reit to be a co-owner in the units, which makes home ownership cheaper as well.
 

Being able to tap capital markets means that HDB bears a smaller financial burden than if it were to supply the extra flats on its own, making public financing issues less of a worry.
 

The homes injected into the Reit can be sold to Singaporean CPF members, with HDB or banks as financiers and a subsidiary of HDB as the Reit's manager. The tax-exempt rental income earned by the Reit is returned to investors in the form of distributions.
 

There are no residential Reits in Singapore at the moment because yields for private homes have been low, the authors said.
 

Having this Reit can provide investment alternatives for Singaporeans. Prof Lee said that investors enjoy the upside of the property market without having to buy a physical home which can be illiquid.
 

Examples of beneficiaries are buyers constrained by funds who will not need to settle for shoebox units and CPF members who can draw down on their savings for investments beyond real estate.
 

The Reit can also provide higher yields than rental income due to the tax-free dividends, which can help to cool interest in property as a hedge against inflation.
 

Rental increases at the Reit's properties can be managed through regulation and not fully subject to market forces, the authors suggested, to ensure that social objectives are not at the expense of bottom lines.
 

Prof Lee acknowledged that the "devil is in the details" at this stage, and the team plans further studies to shed more light on the implementation of such a housing Reit.
 

But there is no such thing as a free lunch, and he urged caution should the idea come to pass eventually.
 

"It is not totally risk free," he said.
 

It may sound radical, but the concept of using Reits to provide affordable housing has been adopted in other countries. The first social housing Reit was set up in Britain last year, while the US's second such Reit was formed in April.

My point isn't that u didn't struggle, work hard to earn your money, my point is, your unique situation allows you to make decisions others cannot make.
 

You work hard, I work hard, toilet cleaner also work hard. You can choose not to play stupid money games like taking loans that cripple, make wise investment decisions n eventually lead a good life. I have no choice but to play some of the stupid money games but hopefully everything will turn out well and my life might not be so bad afterall. The toilet cleaner from Day 1 has to contend with being born with probably not too smart genes, have to support disabled/alcoholic/gambler parents or other burdens we do not face. Ironically he, same as you, do not have to play stupid money games (haha) but his life probably sucks to the core.
 

I just think that people do make unwise financial decisions but many of the times (not all I agree) they have no choice not to play the game, just like so many things in life where we have no choice. If people really have absolute Free Will, many would have chosen not to be born :(

I've been spending so much time away from my children building my business, my eldest daughter asked me why am I always at the shop working?
 

I told her so I can make a lot of money, buy her a lot of toys and buy her a big house.
 

She told me not to go to work, picked up an old broken toy and said "I still got many toys". And the she laid down on the floor and flailed her arms, "look daddy our house is so big already, I can lie down!!!"
 

After that I wept bitterly.

But I definitely do agree with your fav phrase, 不要打肿脸充胖子 and buy a property one cannot afford just to look good and show off. In the first place I don't see what's there to show off....a 1 room flat or a mansion, both are made from stones. Ferrari or Chery QQ, both made from metal.
 

Things worth showing off are Courage, Integrity , Compassion, etc...

That's because children are viewed as a liability, a burden, not an asset. When we see people with bungalows, luxury cars and expensive watches, we view them as "rich" because these things give them joy in life. Actually, the joy that children give is much much more than all these, but do we think the same when we see a family with 4 or 5 kids?
 

Don't talk about feeding n educating the children, because bungalow also need maintenance works, luxury car and watch also need servicing lol

I think one entire generation has been lost in pursuit of gdp growth. This group is d current 25-40yr old. No amt of money or incentive can make them decide to have more children. I I don't want to dwell on d past but hope policy makers see this as their main priority



 

that is the problem ...i remember clearly during school day... parent ..media ...school always tell me...to be successful must be Uni ... then can drive car then got big house then can go holiday ...and find successful hubby... no way children come into picture    of course i go against all these teaching

My point isn't that u didn't struggle, work hard to earn your money, my point is, your unique situation allows you to make decisions others cannot make.
 

You work hard, I work hard, toilet cleaner also work hard. You can choose not to play stupid money games like taking loans that cripple, make wise investment decisions n eventually lead a good life. I have no choice but to play some of the stupid money games but hopefully everything will turn out well and my life might not be so bad afterall. The toilet cleaner from Day 1 has to contend with being born with probably not too smart genes, have to support disabled/alcoholic/gambler parents or other burdens we do not face. Ironically he, same as you, do not have to play stupid money games (haha) but his life probably sucks to the core.
 

I just think that people do make unwise financial decisions but many of the times (not all I agree) they have no choice not to play the game, just like so many things in life where we have no choice. If people really have absolute Free Will, many would have chosen not to be born :(



 

There is a choice for you lah.
 

There is no need to play "stupid" money games.  

Becos stupid money games are played by people who have millions, people who are supposedly brilliant, even people who are born with a silver spoon.  Thats how people end up losing more than their pants.
 

This is not saying that you are wrong and i am right.

This is saying that, if the choice is to play, then dont say no choice.

At least not for most of the folks here.

Problem is we all suffer from the "Enough is never enough" syndrome.
 

There are really people out there who have no choice and we are not them.

Not me, and not you definitely.
 

You seem to have departed somewhat from your old self, mate.

Something must have brought about that change.

As i said not about right or wrong.

Its about your own priniciples and putting the money where your mouth is.
 

Best.

Just the difficulties in my struggling business has made me less critical of human weakness. Yes I've a choice to move or not to move. But some ppl really got no "choice"....wife that looks down on the husband for not being able to afford pte ppty, relatives n friends that damage his self esteem everyday....just for example. Personally I know of 1 such guy already I think there might be more out there, who knows.
 

Or they themselves are slaves to their own desires of "moving up"....they're not less enslaved than the rest.

I think it is a common fallacy that success is all dependent on yourself and if someone fails it is because of one fault.
 

I think "LUCK" meaning the outside conditions that are beyond our control is probably the dominant factor.
 

Thus if one has succeeded, one should not be too proud thinking those who did not are "stupid", "lazy" or made the wrong decisions. Most of the time it is just plain luck.
 

I used to work for a 6 billion dollar chip company. It was started by an Indonesian. I had the chance to have lunch with the CEO/Founder some years back and asked him how the company succeeded. He told us it was pure luck. The first design win was always the hardest and they had that design win not because they are good but rather the competitor screwed up big time (luck). 
 

Of course, when the opportunity presents itself, one must be ready (this part is talent and hard work).

I wont pity this person as he had obviously pick a wrong person as a wife.
 

and the wife?? she had only herself to blame for not picking a more able hubby.
 

my wife due to her choice of industries and us deciding that she will do her degree before me is earning nearly 2 times more then what I am earning. however, there is at no time did she look down on me and giving me the proper a husband deserve whether in private or in public.
 

and yes they still have a choice. Choice of making the best of what they have or moaning and complaining all day long.
 

do note, we are living for only a few decades in the world, life is never fair, government decision will never be equal unless the ideal of communism can be practise to its maximum best. given all these situation, how are we suppose to live happily?? the best way to live a better and happier life is to stop complaining about it, living what you have to the best that you can and then try to see anyway we can Improve it.
 

I know earlier you have a example of a cleaner that doesn't have a choice, but truth of matter is, he had. but does he/she dare to step out of his comfort zone into another area? I had seen many that due to their own fear, do not dare to take the first step to make changes. but when they do, they realise that they should had done so earlier.

There is no common fallacy lah
 

Allow me to reiterate.  I've said it once, i say it again.
 

Financial SUCCESS is NEVER all dependant on oneself.

Luck does play a meaningful part. Some more so than others
 

However sustaining the success, thats the tough part.
 

To everyone who has ever met me or spoken to me before.

I always tell them to be prepared. Be prepared for what?

For I believe , at least twice in our lifetime, lady luck will shine on us.

Whether we are prepared and sharp enough to "receive" this luck is largely up to us.
 

As the saying goes," a fool and his money are soon parted."

This also implies that a fool can still have money.

The supply of condo is clearly quite high.

Many units either purposely go empty or may go empty.

Whatever it is , dont rely on a fat rent to cover ones instalments.

Be prepared to go with no rent for a long time.

That ensures your ability to survive in a real downturn.
 

Place the wrong bet and you will go hone with nothing.
 

And to prove that i believe luck does matter.
 

I wish all GOOD LUCK......

no sweat as long as interest rate is low even rental is soften

as far as my observation ... after TOP ... many rent out their units

they bought with their eyes wide open with SSD if they sell in the 1st 4 years which means they can hold

ie. 1st property is fully paid, 2nd/3rd property can be supported thru cpf + cash + rental and interest rate is low with 25 years repayment period
 

the percentage of over-stretch investor is minority ... should be no problem unless economy crashed and they lost their job ... 

economy crashed likelihood is very very low ... based on current event ... tapering off yes ... crash ... nah

But some men are not as lucky as you are. I know of some who keep comparing husbands of their friends to their own husband, etc.

Complaining & comparing are a Singaporean culture, (like British like to talk about weather, & German like to drink beer, & American love for fattening stuff) since the day we are born, we are being compared, from which school we enroll, what position in our classes, why we score for our exam, what job we have, how much money we earn, & what title we hold, how big our house...

lucky?? I don't think so. 

prior to getting married, in fact before we talk about getting married. we had already talk about all this thing.

and I had also assess what type of person she is and her values. (she do that on me too, of course)
 

courting is not just a process of getting the girl to love you and married you (or some to get into bed) its suppose to be the time you get to know your gf and to see if the person is suitable for you or if you can accept his/her character. many time ppl during court ship is only thinking of maintaining the relationship without thinking of finding out who their potential spouse really are.

if any that is posted is not true or exaggerated, please say so, otherwise please do stop making these trolling comments, for most of us, we don't really appreciate the meaning of life, since birth with each passing day, we are all waiting for death and one day closer, but most of us take it for granted and live life like we can live forever; unfortunately for a person who had the misfortune of suffering from a chronic or incurable disease, their mortality becomes a reality; in the case of end-stage kidney disease, there is no cure except for a kidney transplant and when will that be, in the meantime undergoing dialysis isn't a walk in the park and with each dialysis one is being "poisoned" slowly by the dialysis process; so in short, it is rational to think that someone of the latter would know what is the meaning of life, how to treasure life, what is most important in one's life, if you think I have posted earlier without any basis then you have the right to call me that, otherwise please do not make small of the encouragement that we are trying to give to skunk; I cant use myself as an example or credentials, what have gone through in life that is so devastating that I can say, that I truly understand the value of life and what is most important in our lives, thank you

complain and compare is one of spore long rooted identity since govt like to speak of spore identity

it's a chinese thingy ... look at hong kong and china ... but taiwan is less prominent in this culture though

then look at japan and south korea where their economy is more advanced and population in the city is more density ... but less complain and compare culture surface in their daily life

let's put it this way, how one reads it can be with a clouded veil or one that sees it as the truth, in case u missed my medishield thread.  Nevertheless, impartiality remains as is, with no forbearance on any judgement i may make.  Djim saw it in the light i posted as Radx, the member, not the moderator.  Djim has also shared his sides which breached the threshold and he is cognizant of that, but all is good.
 

Like if you troll, and i have warned you before, and i do remember, then you get your just desserts.  Nothing agst you , but just the kind of manner in which you present the issues.  However for you, be it your age or what, you tend to forget and test the threshold again and again, WHENEVER YOU ARE ONLINE, and can be disturbing.

anyway to get this thread back on track, Bt Batok, prices are softening too.   Used to be in 5xxk, now down to 4xxk for 4 rm..



 

confirm softening. COV is REALLY dropping, now you hear more of "At value can try", "asking 10K COV" etc etc. Rental Mkt is down too, Friends are taking longer to find tenant .... And best part is --> the bumper crop of TOP-ed developments still yet to hit full force

No govt is more powerful than market force. 

Govt can influence but cannot control.

Otherwise Singapore will be 100% shun shun li li happily ever after.

if your friend doesn't qualify/cant wait for BTO (waiting time is 3-4 yrs currently) and is planning to get married and settled down.

I'm assuming they earn somewhere between 10-15k/mth. so they can have the option of both... (lowish income straight forward is HDB, higher than 20k should be PC)
 

Would you recommend them to go for resale HDB or PC at this juncture?

Condo is just an expensive HDB with a swimming pool n security guards. Do they go swimming very very often? :p

hawker cant tell whether you are rich or not and prices will be charged the same for all ... and easily affordable by all 

 ...however housing diff woh they can only build that much ...and if all the rich pple go buy public housing that will deprive the commoner chances of owning a unit of the public housing woh 
 

ok lah..there is always 2 side of coin and pple with different views... best is no private housing ...all go public swee bo lolz ...every one equal 

else all go private no public ... very hard to co-exist for both cos everyone has their own opinion who to own what  :D

i think during the singapore conversation, there was a feedback to remove the income ceiling cap

ie: if both parent are working and exceed $10k but they want to live thrifty and wish to stay in bto hdb, why not? especially they need more $$$ to raise a family and do not want to buy $600k sengkang resale flat
 

1. exceed income ceiling = no $30k subsidy

2. exceed income ceiling = buy 4 rooms hdb and above
 

why not? why income $10k must buy resale flat that the 1st owner buy $300k sell $600k? i guess this is the main reason why everyone want to buy BTO ... just hantam ... kena BTO = kena TOTO

MOP should be extended to 8 years (at least) so that people not anyhow want to flip the property

want to speculate and flip, money roll money, go play private property

public housing is a roof over head for family ...

Resale HDB are hit hard by latest cooling measures that came in end Jan 2013. My friend has been trying to sell off his place at jurong west since march and until now less than 6 viewings. Actually it's location lah. Since last year, jurong west area less than 10 year 5 room flat that needs to take bus to MRT cost 400+k, eunos area 30 year old 5 room flat, while older, is bigger, that is within walking distance to MRT cost 400+k to 500k. 
 

If any PR were to pay 5% for ABSD, or any Singaporean that have to put in significant savings, they would be more selective since there are plenty of laggard price resale HDB around that is nearer to town and pricing wise almost same same.

if you see it another way.. when it is cheap means economy is not good... cash is power...so keep them better than buying 

when price are up...it can be a sign that economy is good...pple with ample cash start buy...demand is there and supply limited so price will just go up and up

how much cash can a middle (read: non-elite definition) income household really keep for such purposes?
 

I reckon maybe 300k to 400K (sabbie level) max.   the rest are probably invested and unable to liquidate.
 

how big can one hoot with this amount?
 

and when the time comes, have guts to hoot or not also another issue

when d time comes, its abt maximizing return, not necessary to have big cash. Say a 1M prop, then downpay 20% = 200K. If timing is right easily 100% return on 200K quickly.
 

Other assets such as stocks or even fire sale companies can give 100% returns, in some cases 1000+% returns if u bought them at cycle lows.
 

For someone w say 200k, u need a gameplan to take advantage of every recession. It will take abt 2-4 economic cycles to accumulate alot of wealth.
 

Also u need time to plan it. If no time to plan coz working nonstop, then likely will miss alot of opportunities

钱不是万能的，但是 没有钱是万万不能.. Just like a country must have president or king Lolz

I dun think there is a real definition of high or low income .. 

Last time when my monthly income is $800 I see those earn $1.2k

High income ..when I reached $1.2k those 1.8k is high income... It kept changing so

How to definite high income cos It changes according to time

yup there was such a suggestions. Frankly the common argument against such a measure is that those "rich" people should not fight with those who REALLY need public housing.
 

That above is not really a good reason especially if you believe what HDB says... 80% of the households fall within the income ceiling. Is adding an additional 20% really going to affect the rest of the 80%??? One must remember that HDB BTO is not a bidding system unlike COE. The rich 20% also must ballot... so to the rest of the 80%, it is like their chances of getting a BTO drop by 20%.

just out of curiosity ... if you own a HDB and a condo... which one would like stay and which one will you rent out ?
 

 
 
I Very suay, never owned a HDB in my life before.  
Got no chance to make easy money.
 
But i have mentioned many times, i will stay in the better place.
It depends on whether the HDB or the Condo is the better place .

funny how people always say cash is king
 
when economy tanks, hoot big big
 
how much cash can a middle (read: non-elite definition) income household really keep for such purposes?
 
I reckon maybe 300k to 400K (sabbie level) max.   the rest are probably invested and unable to liquidate.
 
how big can one hoot with this amount?
 
and when the time comes, have guts to hoot or not also another issue
 
 
 

 
It simply means that when times are bad, you must hv sufficient liquidity to do the things that you are suitable/capable of doing.
 
For some people a couple of hundred grand is it.
For others a couple of million.
For the real elites, its in the tens of millions at least.
 
Its more of the concept, and not so much the actual amount.

Location is a wonderful reason to buy a property. But strangely some ppl see a condo in a poor location as an "upgrade" compared to a HDB in a good location. Or a tiny condo over a large HDB.

My point isn't that u didn't struggle, work hard to earn your money, my point is, your unique situation allows you to make decisions others cannot make.
 

You work hard, I work hard, toilet cleaner also work hard. You can choose not to play stupid money games like taking loans that cripple, make wise investment decisions n eventually lead a good life. I have no choice but to play some of the stupid money games but hopefully everything will turn out well and my life might not be so bad afterall. The toilet cleaner from Day 1 has to contend with being born with probably not too smart genes, have to support disabled/alcoholic/gambler parents or other burdens we do not face. Ironically he, same as you, do not have to play stupid money games (haha) but his life probably sucks to the core.
 

I just think that people do make unwise financial decisions but many of the times (not all I agree) they have no choice not to play the game, just like so many things in life where we have no choice. If people really have absolute Free Will, many would have chosen not to be born :(

You lie down and wait slowly.  
 

They will by all means prop up the prices. Main thing is to force people to take long term and high loans and work day and night to service it. Same thing with taxi - no more private individual owner operator. They are forced to rent at sky high rentals and have to drive long hours. You know, when people are too free, they tend to "zhao fan".  Main idea is to make people very busy rats.

My HDB fetching $2600 per month rental. My condo $3000.
 

I am staying in the condo and renting out HDB. Reasons are obvious:

a. Relative return, HDB is better.

b. Condo I park 2 cars free. HDB, I pay 1 open lot, 1 multi-storey CP ($60+$90 = $150 a mth)

c. environment.

when d time comes, its abt maximizing return, not necessary to have big cash. Say a 1M prop, then downpay 20% = 200K. If timing is right easily 100% return on 200K quickly.
 

Other assets such as stocks or even fire sale companies can give 100% returns, in some cases 1000+% returns if u bought them at cycle lows.
 

For someone w say 200k, u need a gameplan to take advantage of every recession. It will take abt 2-4 economic cycles to accumulate alot of wealth.
 

Also u need time to plan it. If no time to plan coz working nonstop, then likely will miss alot of opportunities



 

formula is simple but difficult to execute
 

if not many people would be rich and there would be no poor people in the world
 

so how many folds you gained in the last crisis?

controlling the ownership of property in Singapore is not wrong, but controlling of ownership of foreign property is not proper lah. Leave it to that country's law to handle. It's politically suicidal also considering many Singaporeans are buying into retirement homes nearby.

anyway, i think is a far fetch la

whatever the policy changes may be ... it's a huge move ... must handle with care
 

a. hdb = asset ... this one had been sunk in deeply liao

b. hdb = a basic need for housing for everyone
 

asset = buy low sell high

asset = appreciate over time

asset = passive income
 

basic need = stay and live ... that's all ...
 

however, to make a u-turn on hdb = asset now is a huge task as 99% of sporean think their hdb is an asset even they live in it because buy $300k and sell $600k ... who don't want?

however, to make a u-turn on hdb = asset now is a huge task as 99% of sporean think their hdb is an asset even they live in it because buy $300k and sell $600k ... who don't want?



 

yup HDB flats is d ultimate too big to fail. that means they will "always have to" bail it out, but bailout cld also mean eroding d sovereign value of SG's balance sheet, either by using cash reserve or printing $. I wont b surprised if we lose our AAA rating if bailouts do occur.

based on this report, there are 40,000 HDB wholly sublet.

if there is a policy change, these 40,000 HDB will either go into resale market or owner move back to HDB and rent out their private property
 

40,000 is the official figure in hdb database excluding the infamous lock-one-room trick
 

if you check out property forum, the biggest bashing is why allow hdb owner to live in private property and rent out their hdb ... aka hogging the hdb, deprive other whom can only afford to live in hdb
 

i don't blame these 40,000 owners, if i could i would do the same too ... who don't want? it's not a crime

if want to blame, blame the policy ...

Khaw shares ideas to lower prices of HDB flats

One suggestion for debate: insist that owners must sell homes back to HDB
 

By Poon Chian Hui
 

TWO days after signalling a critical rethink of the role and nature of public housing, Minister for National Development Khaw Boon Wan yesterday threw up a few suggestions as to how exactly policy may change.
 

Shortening leases, extending the minimum occupation period or even reinstating a pre-1971 rule that owners can sell HDB flats only back to the Housing Board are all solutions up for discussion, which may help to lower the prices of new flats.
 

The minimum occupation period, introduced to reduce speculation, is the shortest period before the whole flat can be rented out or sold. It now stands at five years.
 

The last suggestion would mean an HDB flat owner could sell his flat not on the market, but only to the HDB, at the price he bought it at, with perhaps some interest, said Mr Khaw.
 

These are "reasonable suggestions" raised by MPs and the public which he will discuss with various groups, including the public.
 

He said this yesterday in relation to his Parliament pledge last Friday of making new flats cheaper by some 30 per cent, with those in non-mature estates to cost about four years of one's salary, down from 5.5 years now.
 

In Parliament, he also said it would be good to re-examine some old assumptions, including that of HDB flats being treated as appreciating assets.
 

At the heart of this transition is the impact of trade-offs between distinct groups, like home owners and home buyers, who may have differing views and needs.
 

"How do we make sensible trade-offs which are sustainable?" Mr Khaw asked yesterday.
 

"Most people actually do not have a housing problem. But a minority do, and they are serious housing problems," he said.
 

"So we need to tackle them, but in a way that is not at the expense of home owners."
 

A group that will feel the sting of dipping prices are those relying on rental income. Their tenants usually comprise people who cannot afford a new flat.
 

This is why the Government cannot keep building new flats, Mr Khaw said. "If I keep on meeting new demand, I am actually hurting the many home owners who now rent out their own properties. And there are many."
 

Some 40,000 entire HDB flats are being sublet; up to another 40,000 owners rent out rooms.
 

Rather, what he hopes to do is to engineer a "soft landing".
 

Mr Chris Koh, director of property agency Chris International, said an extension of the minimum occupation period may help reduce property speculation as it discourages those who are more interested in making money from flat sales and rental income. Instead, people who intend to stay for the long haul are more likely to buy the flats.
 

Chesterton Suntec International director of research and consultancy Colin Tan felt shorter leases are unlikely to work. In theory, shortening the leases from 99 years for most flats means they can be sold more cheaply. "There is likely to be only a one-time lowering of prices," he said. "The problem can come back as supply is not keeping up with demand."

This includes husband and wife. 

No ownership of any other property local or elsewhere.

Any foul play results in immediate confiscation and fine equivalent to 2x price of that HdB.
 

I am all for it!

are you saying forgo condo and get a hdb, which generate a better return in rental?
 




My HDB fetching $2600 per month rental. My condo $3000.
 

I am staying in the condo and renting out HDB. Reasons are obvious:

a. Relative return, HDB is better.

b. Condo I park 2 cars free. HDB, I pay 1 open lot, 1 multi-storey CP ($60+$90 = $150 a mth)

c. environment.
 

No need rocket scientist to tell me which is my choice.

it isnt simple. i didnt mention how stressful it was to find a prop which cld get 80% finance at bottom of mkt as most sellers were asking above valuation as banks pushed down valuations alot. i wasnt willing to pay more than 20% down so it took a couple of mths before finding d right place.
 

anyway just sharing some of my experience. plenty of others out there who disagree w my views.



 

like i said, the devil is in the execution
 

unless the 20% down is an inconsequential amount of money to you

this is bad news... now the government will tackle this issue haiz ...
 

By Charissa Yong

MORE Housing Board flat owners have been renting out their units in recent months - a phenomenon attributed to upgraders who want to keep their flats even as they move on to private property.
 

HDB figures last month showed a 6 per cent rise in subletting transactions between the first and second quarters of this year, from 7,410 cases to 7,891.
 

The number of transactions in the second quarter was also about 15 per cent higher than the 6,900 cases in the same period last year.
 

More flats were also rented out last month - 1,760 according to Singapore Real Estate Exchange (SRX) estimates, up 27 per cent from 10 months ago.
 

Industry watchers said this is because there are more upgraders who own private property and want to rent out their HDB units for additional income.
 

Mr Chris Koh, director of property firm Chris International, traces this to a rule introduced three years ago, which mandates that private property owners must sell their existing property if they buy an HDB resale flat.
 

That is why some HDB owners with private property prefer not to sell their flats, he said. They cannot buy a resale flat once their HDB unit is sold while still holding on to private property.
 

HDB owners who have lived in their flat for the minimum occupation period are allowed to purchase private property and hold on to both at the same time.
 

The move towards renting out HDB flats is also fuelled by the large number of private units that are being completed this year - especially shoebox units, said R'ST Research director Ong Kah Seng.
 

"Many singles who have been staying with their parents in HDB flats have moved into the shoebox apartment they bought," he said. "The room they vacated can be rented out."
 

Entire flats are also freed up when aged parents move into a married child's home, he added.
 

One such person is semi- retired cashier Ang Ling Buang, 73, who began renting out his five-room flat in Hougang to an Indonesian family in March.
 

Mr Ang now lives with his wife in his son's Punggol flat, where he helps to take care of his grandson. He gets $2,600 in rent monthly.
 

For now, the increased supply has not had an impact on monthly median rent prices, which have stayed at $2,400 over the past year, SRX data showed.
 

Demand for HDB rentals is still robust because public flats are cheaper to rent than private ones of similar sizes.
 

This is especially appealing to foreigners, said ERA Realty key executive officer Eugene Lim, as their rental budgets are often part of their salary packages.
 

"So to save money, more foreign employees are renting from the HDB market," he said.
 

Moreover, tenants sharing a room can save even more. "The rooms in many old HDB flats are very spacious, suitable for tenants to share," said Mr Ong.
 

But even with the increased supply of flats for rent, some landlords are still picky about tenants.
 

Mr Koh said most Singaporean flat owners prefer renting out to "good profile tenants" like couples with children. But those looking to rent in areas like Woodlands, Sembawang and Marsiling are mainly workers who want to share a flat or room.
 

"I've heard from agents on the ground that it now takes two months to rent out HDB flats that would have previously been rented out in two weeks," he said.

another factor why its a big concern: if the rents for the HDB flats drop, owners will have less cash to cover private prop mortgage. Then if a big recession occurs n owners loses his job, he may b forced to sell one of his properties. Even without recession, a drop in HDB rent will make d owner have less cash to spend

Going by what they've been doing so far, it will be a populist policy change. So ppl renting hdbees out will lppl. 
 

But again, going by what they've been doing so far, it will be a policy which will "seem" like helping the low income but actually benefit the rich and at the same time, screw the middle income.

all is well in a short recession as seen in 2008-2009 all thanks to helicopter ben. IF we get another extended crash likw 2000-2004, garmen will have no other way buy to go into reserves to fund spending.  The more this "raiding of reserves", the less stable our credit rating. Im abit long term macro for most but i can see this happening already thats y GCT already voicing concerns. Our population demographic is unfavourable thats y d truth is we have to keep importing young FTs coz we simply dont have enough babies to take care of d baby boomers going forward

Over-stretched borrowers unlikely to default

By Yasmine Yahya

Singapolitics | Mon, Aug 12, 2013

SINGAPORE - Singaporean households are overall in good financial shape and even those who may have over-stretched themselves are unlikely to default on their loans even when interest rates rise.
 

Mr Lawrence Wong, a director on the board of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, reiterated in Parliament on Monday that only 5 to 10 per cent of property loan borrowers here are servicing debts amounting to over 60 per cent of their monthly incomes.
 

Housing loans constitute the bulk of their debt, he said.
 

"But it doesn't mean they will automatically default on their loans. Most of these borrowers have above-average income levels. The majority took up private housing loans and are only servicing one housing loan, so they are likely to have a larger absolute buffer in income and assets."
 

Mr Wong was speaking on behalf of MAS chairman and Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, in response to a question raised by Nominated MP Laurence Lien.
 

Mr Wong added that household balance sheets are on the whole in good shape, with the household debt to income ratio falling in the second half of the last decade.
 

The debt-to-income ratio of 2.1 times last year was still "significantly lower" than the 2.6 times seen in the middle of the last decade, he added, which means that Singaporean households "are not more leveraged than they have been in the last decade".

So many mixed signals on this. Seems like every other week they're contradicting themselves. First they contradict Moody's, then they come out with total debt servicing ratio restrictions, then now say those overleveraged ones got "above average incomes" and buffers.

Over leveraged means over leveraged. Whether income is above average or super high doesnt matter.

If one is not over leveraged, even if income low also ooon oon

Obviously that fella doesnt know the meaning of over leveraged.

The word "over" already say it all.

That would be a paper loss. So can't even sell, die die must hold on and continue servicing the loan, in whatever way....

Yes, correct. Must top-up the loss in value! 

But then people nowadays just do not believe such negative market situations will happen. Hence just keep on going....think positively, and positively.

That's what happened in 1997, triggered by thr local banks to call for equity top up. 
 

However in 2007/2008, it seems the banks have held back asking for equity top up on loans. The only property related loans that I heard that got margin calls are OD pledge using property. 
 

MAS is much prepared in 2008 with the experrience in 1997. That's why not much bloodshed on the property market.

Yes, but

When push comes to shove, you think they care?

Valuations down, overleveraged heads will roll if no cash.

Simple as that.

Banks do what is in their interest, not your interest leh.

i do not see any catapult that will trigger a crash, equity top up or default
 

1. interest remain low even with 0.5-1% increase gradually (if rates does goes up). usa and europe cannot survive without low interest rate
 

2. spore low unemployment rate. with further tightening of FT ... jobs should be secured
 

3. local bank balance sheet is sibei strong
 

4. the financial market is healthy and growing, at least for the asia market.
 

5. the best time of asia still intact with usa and europe region in dire strait. protests and strikes still on going from time to time. 
 

6. investments and hot money still remain in asia.
 

properties will sustain and continue to go up ... just much slower compare to last year. 2011-2012  was crazy ... property price skyrocketed. skyhabitat $2000psf for suburban 99LH condo?

its not so much MAS was prepared, they created a "lifeboat" fund but didnt use it much...its becoz of helicopter ben.
 

talking 2 my private banker frens, they all knew that if d recession didnt bottom in march 2009, another few mths there wld have been massive margin calls, equity top ups etc for their leveraged clients.
 

Thats y i say 2008-2009 was like a blip, recovered so fast compared to 2000-2004. 
 

I dont dare to predict anything so i dont know if we will have another asian crisis or not. I just have a balanced portfolio thats all. If the smartest fund mgrs have no idea wat will happen next, who are we to predict wat will happen next. just stay prepared up n downside.

But when it was staring at our faces back in 2007, who saw it coming?
 

No near term upside is my view.  

Buy if need to stay.  For investment, must wait long long before can sell.

I saw it but like most, wasnt quite convinced to act on it.

Yes i did sell my property in 2nd half 2007 which was seen as the peak then.

But for other assets i didnt let go and suffered 6figure losses.
 
 

Its not only about seeing it coming, but really gathering all your faith and conviction to act on it.

For own stay means that it is to allow your life to move on to next stage.

It is more than simply dollars and cents.
 

Thats why we work hard for to begin with.
 

Imagine you already planned for everything and ready to commit and move into your next stage of life.

But becos of the possibility of saving some money, you delay and step into the uncertain.

I think its not necessary lah.  But thats me.  Different people got duff formula

by the time want to act on it, it is usually too late.  so just keep.

Both also crashed but more than recovered, thats why cash is king is during d crash u may have lost your job etc n u dont want to b forced to liquidate assets for cash. Also like i said 08-09 was a blip, anymore protracted there wld have been serious blood on d streets.

agreed if it is for own stay it more than dollars and cents ... the objective is move to next stage and not how much return i get if i sell...so it doesnt matter how others see but as long as one can pay for it why not ...  if you dun dare to step in now... what makes you think you dare to step in when the so called downfall period has arrived ...

Yes, I sold down much later and then bought back cheaper recovering all my losses and making a bit.  
 

But the point was, that i "saw" it yet i just couldnt act on it becos not convicted enough.  Such things not easy to decide.  
 

Like right now all the signal points to a weaker property market.

We can see it but most will refuse to act becos we still hope it can go up becos we hv vested interest.

The moves by the govt is so "in your face" already.  

But we prefer to listen to property agents who act like they know the market so well.

Yes, I sold down much later and then bought back cheaper recovering all my losses and making a bit.  
 

But the point was, that i "saw" it yet i just couldnt act on it becos not convicted enough.  Such things not easy to decide.  
 

Like right now all the signal points to a weaker property market.

1. lelong sale from owner if they cannot tahan due to whatever reason such as giving up due to financial strain, no rental, whatever
 

2. buy unsold top units from developer directly. i got a chance to buy a top units several years back with everything thrown in by developer such as reno, furniture, vouchers, whatever. it is a very nicely done up units. just bring luggage can stay liao.
 

3. if tens of thousands of new units go into the market, rental become softer ... ie: abundance of units ... new launch would be cheaper. else buy new launch. but as throttle said ... got to wait again for it to be developed
 

end of the day, it depends on individual plan and how deep is the pocket. my pocket is definitely not deep enough for current premium no $1100psf no talk for 99LH condo
 




What would happen then?

in abt 10yrs, we will reach 6.9M. Some pple say will keep increasing after that, but looking at the huge negative feedback when 6.9M was first announced, im not sure why theyre so optimistic.
 

garmen is adapting to masses request, not wat a small grp of pple are thinking of. We just have to understand that.

Living on the credit line

By Jennifer Dhanaraj

The New Paper | Tue, Aug 13, 2013

Singaporeans are borrowing more now and many may be in deep trouble, even if they don't immediately realise this.
 

Plus, with many committed on real estate, if mortgage rates go up by 3 percentage points - which experts predict will happen - 1 in 10 borrowers here could find themselves struggling indeed, Mr Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), warned at a press briefing last month.
 

It is enough of a worry that Nominated MP Laurence Lien and Non-Constituency MP Yee Jenn Jong have tabled their questions on the debt level in Singapore for tomorrow's Parliament sitting.
 

The debt picture in Singapore is not rosy.
 

According to a Credit Bureau Singapore (CBS) report, the average amount of debt per borrower is up 27 per cent, from five years ago.
 

As of May this year, the average principal sum that consumers owe for property, motor vehicle and personal loans is $156,980.
 

CIMB economist Song Seng Wun explains the consequences of higher debt. He tells The New Paper on Sunday that the rock-bottom interest rates and easy money available over the last five years have contributed to the situation.
 

"The rising cost of big ticket items like homes and cars have pushed people to borrow more. The problem is these people expect cost of borrowing to remain low, which is not going to be the case."
 

A likely segment to be stretched? CBS says there are 48,782 borrowers who have at least two mortgages in addition to other types of loans now. This is up 78 per cent from 27,343 borrowers in 2008.
 

MAS says that 5 to 10 per cent of borrowers here have probably overstretched themselves on their property purchases.
 

That is, their total debt servicing payments, including those for their home, car and other loans, amount to more than 60 per cent of their income.
 

Mr Song also cautions that borrowers should be more prudent when it comes to property purchases here or overseas.
 

"Borrowers think it's cheap money and expect good returns, but this is not guaranteed. When cost of borrowing does eventually go up and they will find themselves severely stretched."
 

And in the worst case scenario, the debts can mean bankruptcies. And there has already been an increase.
 

From January to June this year, 1,061 bankruptcy orders have been made while only 862 were made in the same period last year. In 2012, there were a total of 1,758 bankruptcy orders made.
 

Data from CBS also shows that consumers now have higher unsecured loans and higher credit card balances as compared with 2008.
 

The average principal sum they owe has gone up from $8,887 in May 2008 to $12,678 as of May this year, which is a rise of 43 per cent. Unsecured loans include credit cards, education and renovation loans.
 

The monthly credit card balance has also risen, from $4,591 in 2008 to $5,488 today - a 19 per cent increase.
 

Mr Song says that there has been a greater dependence on credit because of preferences to lead a certain kind of lifestyle.
 

But he adds that it the increase in credit card balances is not an issue, as long as the consumers have the means.
 

"While, the growth of the economy here is not as much as expected, there are still sufficient job opportunities and this inspires confidence in consumers, who then spend," he says.
 

But banks should be more prudent, for example, by not giving out new credit cards until the consumer has paid his debt.

ure assuming sibor always has to follow fed fund rate... ive got a feeling "they" will make it track US treasuries closer to reflect global financial situations.

Yes it's scary and its possible. That's why taking fixed rate now can be considered if one intends to keep the property for a longer period and not intending to sell off in a year or 2.
 

Those who still have a rather sizable loan to really consider the fixed rate loan lock in if intend to keep the property long term and do not have capacity to fully pay up the loan in the short term.

exclusive HDB unit like some jumbo and EM people just buy with 100K COV without battling an eyelid. Many people have the cash. So translating to car buying, 60-70K downpayment is not that difficult. It just whether they want to or not.

so what?? I also bought already last year.
 

sell high, buy higher. you need to pay more loan and interest. worse, you might not be able to get a loan because house price too high but income too low.

Assuming a low-income couple gets married at age 30 and works until 65, that's 35 working years. Every month $1K set aside for housing installment.
 

35 years x 12 months x $1000 = $420 000
 

That's for low income couple each coming out only $500 per month. We have not factored in profit from capital appreciation from changing house as very few ppl stay in one house for 35 years straight.
 

What more for those who can cough out more than $500 each per month? $1.5m, in my opinion, is just about affordable for many higher income couples.

You cannot disregard what has happened in the last few years.

In other words , when looking at the current market , we must factor in the highly possible parent support, and the highly possible profit from 1st property and also the higher income of heartlanders nowadays.
 

I also heartlander at heart.

In other words , when looking at the current market , we must factor in the highly possible parent support, and the highly possible profit from 1st property and also the higher income of heartlanders nowadays.
 

I also heartlander at heart.



 

so anything also highly possible these day  




i don't want to be labelled
 

i thought i was
 

until you said heartlander buy 1.5m property is sub sub (not rolex har) suay

how high is considered high ? 
 

i would reckon high income pple also high expensive leh so still got balance for 1.5m apt meh



 

Different people got different benchmarks. Personally, I'll never take a vehicle loan of more than a year's income and a housing loan of more than 10 years income.
 

So that means a $100K annual income guy maximum should only buy a $100K car...that's at max, less is better of course.

a house should be fully paid up in less than 10 years if one think about "retirement" plan seriously
 

10 years x 12 months x $1000 = $120,000
 




Assuming a low-income couple gets married at age 30 and works until 65, that's 35 working years. Every month $1K set aside for housing installment.
 

35 years x 12 months x $1000 = $420 000
 

That's for low income couple each coming out only $500 per month. We have not factored in profit from capital appreciation from changing house as very few ppl stay in one house for 35 years straight.
 

What more for those who can cough out more than $500 each per month? $1.5m, in my opinion, is just about affordable for many higher income couples.

10years salary for house is quite high if combined income



 

for a 1.5m house... 10 years = 150,000 per month excluding interest for the time being 

that is a $12.5K instalment payment ... based on govt standard loan payment cnanot be more than 30% of monthly income ...so monthly combined income should be 42K woah

Your calculation didnt factor in DP.
 

Anyway, the fact remains that you cant afford but a lot others can.  

Be it with parents support or other profits.
 

Perhaps you should spend more effort to improve your situation?

yes, to afford a $1.5M property, income must be at least $12.5K

hence, $1.5M property is sup sup water in today context because there are many earning > $12.5K

yeah, have not factor in 20% ($300k) downpayment as minimum ... which mean can push to $1.8M-$1.9M property

Then sell the house and "downgrade" lor. Many SGeans have very unrealistic expectations of Life. Life has its ups and downs, sometimes people get richer materially, sometimes they get poorer, it's part n parcel of Life. Like many people think it's very "demeaning" for elderly SGeans to take on cleaning jobs or to sell their flats n move to smaller ones when children have grown up n move out, or it's "demeaning" to take a reverse mortgage, those meant for retirees.
 

Whenever those seniors come to clean my table I always thank them profusely, what a noble job keeping the environment clean n serving fellow men. Who knows, maybe when I'm old I'll be a cleaner too.

1.5m divided by 10 years = 150k

And current cm is cannot be more than 40% of monthly income but I used 30% work backward is 42k what ..

You 2 misunderstood each other. What Skunk meant is that loan of house should not be more than 10 years of current salary. Nothing to do with repayment and installment.

now is no $1.5M no talk
 

$1.5M is the new level of cheap condo for singapore
 


Wednesday, Aug 14, 2013

The Straits Times
 

SINGAPORE - Most upcoming suburban condominium launches are likely to breach the $1,200 per sq ft (psf) price threshold, based on an analysis of recently sold government land sites.
 

Land prices have shot up sharply in recent months as developers remain bullish on the property market despite several rounds of cooling measures.
 

Out of the 10 99-year leasehold suburban residential sites that have been sold under the Government Land Sales programme since the start of last year but have not been officially launched yet, six are expected to go on the market at above $1,200 psf, according to data compiled by consultancy CBRE.
 

Two have already started marketing activities over the National Day weekend - Thomson Three in Bright Hill Drive and Skywoods in Dairy Farm Road - with some units going for above $1,200 psf, according to property agents.
 

Of the rest, only one site, at Sengkang West Way, is expected to launch close to $1,000 psf.
 

On the other end of the spectrum, the most expensive suburban launches are expected to be at New Upper Changi Road, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 2 and Yishun Ring Road, all of which are likely to launch at above $1,400 psf.
 

This follows a trend of recent suburban launches at above $1,200 psf on average, including J Gateway in Jurong that launched at a median price of $1,486 psf in late June and Urban Vista in Tanah Merah, which launched at a median $1,503 psf in March.
 

Office professional Jamie Tay, 48, said the $1,200 psf level was already "a bit expensive" for suburban condos, given their distance from the city centre.
 

However, analysts said the market is likely to be able to stomach launch prices of up to $1,500 psf before it baulks, as long as total prices stay relatively affordable.
 

"Tightening credit may put a dent on sales volumes in the medium-term. However, suburban condominium prices should remain at an affordable price of up to $1.5 million," said CBRE executive director of residential Joseph Tan.
 

OrangeTee research head Christine Li also pointed out that developers have been building ever smaller units with higher psf prices, which keeps total prices from shooting up significantly.
 

Ms Li noted that most demand for suburban condos comes from buyers upgrading from Housing Board flats, some of whom have made a pretty penny from reselling their HDB flat.
 

She said the next psychologically significant level would be around the $1,500 psf mark for suburban condos, at which point buyer demand could drop.
 

The rise in suburban condo prices has helped to boost the popularity of executive condos (ECs), which remain significantly cheaper than suburban condos, market watchers said. But even EC prices are set to go above $800 psf soon.

Old 2-room flat bro, I sammich-class single not qualified to buy new hdb. Process was very smooth, but agent is old friend of my father so he made sure all smooth. Only issue encountered was sourcing for loan because local banks not willing to provide loan for 2-room units. Only complaint is waiting time for hdb appointments could be shorter, but that's something everyone has to deal with.
 

Some might call me crazy for paying just over 300k for a 37 year old, 45 sqm 2-room flat. But location location location and there is strong rental demand because of vivo/habourfront/sentosa/mapletree business city/NOL building nearby and mrt just downstairs, so in the future if I ever want to rent it out there is demand (rental for 2-room units there are +- 2k). But those are just the logical reasons. I really like the neighbourhood (quiet with greenery) and my office is less than 2km away. So yeah I think the price is reasonable.

It is a rare occasion when a billionaire property developer talks the market down. Kwek Leng Beng, Chairman of City Developments Limited (CDL), a leading real estate developer in Singapore, did just that recently when he called buying land in Singapore at today’s prices “suicidal” and predicated an up to 5 percent fall in property prices.



 

He got no guts to really talk it down 

Thats why he can only say 5% fall

Imagine if he said 20% fall, he is breaking his own ricebowl.
 

Think about it now.  Between suicidal and normal , only 5% difference?

Come on.......
 

Pwui.
 

Anyway, i put me money where my mouth is, you all dont sell, i sell.

Sold mine at a price which is suicidal for the buyer a month ago. Completing in about another months time.

Muayhahaha

Harry, who set up ERA Singapore, selling, Indonesian buy buy....   who is right?  
 

ERA Realty sold for over $100m

Buyer is Indonesian private equity player Northstar

The Business Times - August 5, 2013 

By: Felda Chay
 

[sINGAPORE] The Republic's biggest real estate agency ERA Realty Network has been sold for over $100 million to Indonesian private equity firm Northstar Group, months after owner Harry Chua put it on the market.
 

The price is shy of the $150 million that Mr Harry Chua's Hersing Corporation is said to have asked when it put up for sale the master franchise rights to the ERA name in Asia-Pacific.

Notice how "market players" aka property agents like to twist around so that they can say that property market wont drop, will always rise. 
 
 

KNN, supply avalanche, tons of cooling measures and restrictions on credit , plus the chance of rates climbing, yet simply refuse to face reality.  Still believe prices will always rise.  


 

Listen to me, 

No near term upside whatsoever.

5% drop is a definite.

10% drop is most ikely.

Depending on situation 15% to 20% drop is probable too.

2.  close to jb.  worthwhile pumping petrol across causeway
 

3.  scenic, esp the water areas, like admiralty park, the new reservoir.  Further down the yacht club
 

4.  more laid back if u ask me, n not too crowded.  More malaysians there than FTs
 

5.  most impt...no bloody ERP...well, not yet

Notice how "market players" aka property agents like to twist around so that they can say that property market wont drop, will always rise. 
 
 

KNN, supply avalanche, tons of cooling measures and restrictions on credit , plus the chance of rates climbing, yet simply refuse to face reality.  Still believe prices will always rise.  


 

Listen to me, 

No near term upside whatsoever.

5% drop is a definite.

10% drop is most ikely.

Depending on situation 15% to 20% drop is probable too.



 

U mean there are actually people who believe there will be a near term upside meh lol
 

Even a simpleton like me who doesn't know much about property n investments can see that it is going down n will go down for a long while.

He got no guts to really talk it down 

Thats why he can only say 5% fall

Imagine if he said 20% fall, he is breaking his own ricebowl.
 

Think about it now.  Between suicidal and normal , only 5% difference?

Come on.......
 

Pwui.
 

Anyway, i put me money where my mouth is, you all dont sell, i sell.

Sold mine at a price which is suicidal for the buyer a month ago. Completing in about another months time.

Muayhahaha

those people are called contrarian, they may have the last laugh
 

remember a few years ago, when everybody (tom, dick harry including mary, jane etc) were saying that the property market is going to crash and those who sold and don't have a property were basically screwed, today, the financial world is different, predictability is difficult, market manipulation very high, if you ask yourself EU was able to manipulate (including Greece) until some sense of financial stability is in some order
 

what makes us simpleton believe that ASEAN cannot do the same
 

I have come to distrust the likes of Soros including the big mouth Jim Rogers, on many occasions, Jim Rogers, tell people to dump US$ but he has been buying them and selling them when suckers bid for the US$ high, in addition, wasn't too long ago, Jim was telling people to buy commodities, look at what commodities is doing now, counters including WIlmar and Noble have been hit quite hard

I am not upset but just similarly responding that people in general do not take strong unilateral opinions lightly; you sure in your life you never use other people as example and only yourself as example; the minute you talk about others who don't walk their talk you already are comparing with other people; spring water - some do reach the water table and at some point some do go into the river water, on some location, river sometimes end only to exit as spring water
 

it is wonderful that you are a self made man but seriously, I believe 99% already know that you like to walk the talk which you claim and there is no need to bring it up every other thread. Have you for a moment, stop and think, that what you post may even be discouraging for some forummers here, hard-luck for them, but isn't a forum about sharing and accepting other people's opinion even if they don't match ours.

Private home sales fall to 3 1/2 year low 

0 0 0 20130816-private-homes-ST.jpg 

My Paper

Friday, Aug 16, 2013

SINGAPORE - Singapore's new private-home sales last month slid to the lowest since December 2009 as investors baulked at new curbs on property loans and developers marketed fewer projects.
 

Sales of new private homes fell to 481 units last month, 73 per cent lower than June, according to data released yesterday by the Urban Redevelopment Authority. Sales rose to a record 2,793 units in March.
 

Analysts said that new rules governing how financial institutions grant property loans to individuals, unveiled in June, may have dented sales. Another factor to consider was aversion to buying a home during the Chinese Hungry Ghost Festival.
 

"Prospective home buyers are exercising caution...before they make a property purchase," Ms Alice Tan, head of consultancy and research at Knight Frank, said. "New sales volume is likely to stay low in August at around 500 to 700 units."
 

The new framework stipulates that a borrower's debt-servicing ratio must not exceed 60 per cent.
 

But the low sales volume could be just a hiatus, said Ms Christine Li, head of research and consultancy at OrangeTee.
 

"We do expect transaction volume to rebound strongly in September and October, when new launches are back in full force," she said. Despite the fall in volumes, prices seem to be resilient, she added.
 

The private-residential-property price index rose 1 per cent to 215.4 points in the three months ended June 30.

what they don't highlight to you
 


SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes in Singapore plunged in July. 

Figures from the Urban Redevelopment Authority show that just 481 units of new homes were sold last month, down 73 percent from June. 1,806 units were sold in June.
 

This is the lowest sales volume since December 2009.
 

New private home sales in July came in below market expectation as the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework implemented in June has hit a lot harder that expected.
 

Ong Teck Hui, national director of research and consultancy at Jones Lang LaSalle, said: "The TDSR makes loan assessment more difficult, so you can't close the deals as fast as before. It has also impacted several groups of buyers, especially those that are already highly leveraged, those who are dependent on proxy borrowers and guarantors arrangements, and also those with variable income."
 

In fact, analysts said TDSR has been more "devastating" on sales volume compared to the cooling measures introduced in January.
 

The five new projects launched in July had a take-up rate of just 23 per cent, while the take up rate of new launches was 57 per cent in February, following the slew of cooling measures.
 

The top-selling project during the month was Vue 8 Residence in Pasir Ris, which moved 63 units, followed by Bartley Ridge at Mount Vernon Road with 25 units sold.
 

Including executive condominiums (ECs), 593 new homes were sold in July, down from 2,119 units transacted in the previous month.
 

The best-selling EC project was Forestville at Woodlands, which sold 78 new units.
 

Developers launched a total of 557 new units last month, compared to 2,421 units placed for sale in June. 
 

Alice Tan, associate director and head of consultancy and research at Knight Frank, said: "It actually demonstrates that the market is exercising caution from developers and the home buyers side. The price quantum becomes a very important consideration right now.
 

"Going forward, as caution continues to prevail in the market, if sales volume continues to remain slow, there could be some downward pressure in terms of prices for the private residential market in in the next few quarters ahead."
 

Market watchers project that home prices could fall by some three to five per cent on average if buying sentiment remains poor.
 

Some analysts expect sales to pick up slightly in August, at 500 to 700 units. That is likely to be driven by strong demand for the 337-unit development, The Tembusu, located near Kovan MRT station.
 

Looking ahead, OrangeTee said transaction volume is likely to rebound in September and October, when more new projects will be launched.

SINGAPORE: Sales of new private homes in Singapore plunged in July.
 

Figures from the Urban Redevelopment Authority show that just 481 units of new homes were sold last month, down 73 percent from June. 1,806 units were sold in June.
 

This is the lowest sales volume since December 2009.
 

New private home sales in July came in below market expectation as the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework implemented in June has hit a lot harder that expected.
 

Ong Teck Hui, national director of research and consultancy at Jones Lang LaSalle, said: "The TDSR makes kj highly leveraged, those who are dependent on proxy borrowers and guarantors arrangements, and also those with variable income."
 

In fact, analysts said TDSR has been more "devastating" on sales volume compared to the cooling measures introduced in January.
 

The five new projects launched in July had a take-up rate of just 23 per cent, while the take up rate of new launches was 57 per cent in February, following the slew of cooling measures.
 

The top-selling project during the month was Vue 8 Residence in Pasir Ris, which moved 63 units, followed by Bartley Ridge at Mount Vernon Road with 25 units sold.
 

Including executive condominiums (ECs), 593 new homes were sold in July, down from 2,119 units transacted in the previous month.
 

The best-selling EC project was Forestville at Woodlands, which sold 78 new units.
 

Developers launched a total of 557 new units last month, compared to 2,421 units placed for sale in June. 
 

Alice Tan, associate director and head of consultancy and research at Knight Frank, said: "It actually demonstrates that the market is exercising caution from developers and the home buyers side. The price quantum becomes a very important consideration right now.
 

"Going forward, as caution continues to prevail in the market, if sales volume continues to remain slow, there could be some downward pressure in terms of prices for the private residential market in in the next few quarters ahead."
 

Market watchers project that home prices could fall by some three to five per cent on average if buying sentiment remains poor.
 

Some analysts expect sales to pick up slightly in August, at 500 to 700 units. That is likely to be driven by strong demand for the 337-unit development, The Tembusu, located near Kovan MRT station.
 

Looking ahead, OrangeTee said transaction volume is likely to rebound in September and October, when more new projects will be launched.

No leh, nobody highlight anything to me.

Most of the news, i read myself or overheard at lau pa sat while wiping tables......
 

But the Head of research and consultancy says its only temporary, the market will still roar.

The other gurus , say this say that but short of saying that prices WILL come off.....

All vested interest lah, worthless words.

Launch less, sell less. So they actually anticipated this. I suppose August number to be low as well since it is 7th month.

Developers are not stupid too.

Why do you think they launch so few units?

Becos they expect low take up.
 

We know that by now the speculative force has basically been wiped off the market.

Easy credit no longer available and the moment you buy you lose 20%+++ in value if you sell in the first year at the price you bought.

None of my friends is buying, a couple have sold (myself inclusive) and a few more looking to sell.
 

So what fuels the buying now?

The slightly pent up real demand of the low end private housing segment.

These are mostly upgraders who are selling their HDBs / ECs and the likes.
 

The next question is how many can they buy? And at what prices?

Psf is so high but quantum below $1.5mil. That means smallish units mostly.

Some are signing themselves to a sea of debt which could destroy them if any uncertainty happens.

But not that i care , really.
 

Next , we know that rental yields are coming off and the number of units available in the next few years is simply going to blow up.   
 

Good luck fellas

On the other side, developers are still bidding high price for GLS. Recently sales of GLS indicated that psf at least will be 1.2K and above. Some say bcos developers are shortage of land bank so they are still aggressively shoring up land. Developers are usually ahead of curve but why are they still bullish? Are we missing something?

That's because as developers, their job is to develop properties. They cannot sit and do nothing and choose to time the market. What they can do is to bid the land and hope turnaround fast. buy high land and can sell high before the crash come. As a developer, the risk is only a short term one when they launch the project. If sentiment is good, they sell all. They don't have to care there will be oversupply 3 years down the road or low rental as they have gotten of the risk. They are a short term player whereas those individual are long term buyers(at least 4 years).

Okay, you got a point. Developers are short term, their risk window is short. Once they pass the ball to buyer, their backside is as clean as before. Market crash also not their problem.

Yes but they are not bullish

These re the ones who got not much choice.
 

When you run a business of selling properties you need inventory so if you dont buy you cant sell.  

And if you had bought earlier and continuously buy, you average out you psf cost.

As long as you manage to keep your cash flow going and not make losses consecutuvely too many times, you'll still survive.
 

Similarly, look at what happened to mnay coal mining companies.

Are they "ahead" of the curve?  they have no choice.

A tonne of coal sells for about $80 and production /transport cost is currently higher than that for the smaller companies.  Shut down or produce?  If shut down, for how long.  If produce, may have to lose money for how long?
 

Developers are supply side elements.

We already know that the supply is high due to last few years of non stop churning.
 

No, i dont think we are missing anything.

Those units were dirt cheap land price and building cost so it's ok.
 

With todays prices, NO ONE will want to let units go empty.
 

Imagine, a car dealer who bought cars at high cost, he cannot hoard the inventory for too long.

If bought cheap and market price is now high and climbing , of course no problem
 

Otherwise

FE can hoard units without incurring penalties because they are not listed company but privately owned. So they are not affected by this rule.

hmmm...u hv a point der.  Perhaps they did qualify for EC, but at that time to save face, EC and PC like no diff in terms os payments, etc.  Now that the rules have changed, perhaps they realised that they shd stick to within their expectations?   jus guessing.

Let me explain, we know the pool of people who can buy PC is very big.

But even within this pool it can be segmented to several cats.

For simplicity sake, we split to two groups, can definitely make it (cdmi) and just managed to make it(jmmi)

Becos of measures and credit regulations, fear of falling prices etc etc.... Now the Cdmi become jmmi and the jmmi have to look at getting ECs instead.
 

Smilarly, last time i can buy detached, now i can only eat sh1t.....

So what do i do, i look to buy semi detached loh.

Those who last time can buy semi d, now go squeeze the terrace house segment loh.

Those who last time can buy terrace house, now lan lan have to wait lor.
 

So i say, people down the food chain kena squeeze.
 

Better beware, when all this happens, its a strong signal......

In simple words , can I say, down sizing to their means ??
 




Let me explain, we know the pool of people who can buy PC is very big.

But even within this pool it can be segmented to several cats.

For simplicity sake, we split to two groups, can definitely make it (cdmi) and just managed to make it(jmmi)

Becos of measures and credit regulations, fear of falling prices etc etc.... Now the Cdmi become jmmi and the jmmi have to look at getting ECs instead.
 

Smilarly, last time i can buy detached, now i can only eat sh1t.....

So what do i do, i look to buy semi detached loh.

Those who last time can buy semi d, now go squeeze the terrace house segment loh.

Those who last time can buy terrace house, now lan lan have to wait lor.
 

So i say, people down the food chain kena squeeze.
 

Better beware, when all this happens, its a strong signal......

Actually, i wish people quickly cheong to buy. 

Load themselves with debt. Stretchthemselves bad.

Clean house. 

Note that once the market runs out of bullets, it cannot produce enough bullets that easily.

U seem very happy to see people fall. Maybe that cements your place in society, as the capable, the elite? So the roads will no longer have any Altis to block your galloping 911, all the suburban condos will be vacated, people live in bus stop as they salivate at your landed property :p

A sweeping statement of me being happy to see people in general fall is incorrect at the very least.
 

But I am no saint surely.

If they should fall becos of their own silly doing, thats their silly doing.

I do not step on them nor will i pity them.  

I do not expect people to step on me nor pity me either.
 

Society? I do my part and my conscience is clearer that spring water, thats all there is to it.

In terms of my place in society, thats probably middle class likely, forever, unless something really crazy happens in the next 10 yrs.
 

I certainly have no problem with Altises and Sunnies blocking me as long as they pay their fair share of what is due legally and rightfully.

It happens every morning anyway.
 

I however do despise the one who slaps his face swollen to look fat, and drops names to look important.

The one who acts as if he knows everything when his knowledge is merely hearsay.
 

You seem to have suffered some setback and lately your whole philosoply in life and towards living has turned around.

That I definitely noticed.  Its showing through your posts

Perhaps reality of this money driven society finally hit you, hard.
 

As for my behaviour here, its as consistent as an electronic calculator flashing the numbers.

I may not be a saviour as mentioned, but I am certainly no snake, that i can tell you

funny how people always say cash is king
 

when economy tanks, hoot big big
 

how much cash can a middle (read: non-elite definition) income household really keep for such purposes?
 

I reckon maybe 300k to 400K (sabbie level) max.   the rest are probably invested and unable to liquidate.
 

how big can one hoot with this amount?
 

and when the time comes, have guts to hoot or not also another issue

I do not despise anyone, not even mass murderers, whom I consider ill people, much less people who overstretch themselves to buy luxury cars n homes just to show off or people with an inflated ego. These people are just insecure n crave recognition by fellow men.

Sounds like a reluctant upgrader.  Well, it happens to many, my colleague also kanna complained/nagged at by wifey for refusing to upgrade as even his report is staying in a landed while he insisted on staying put in this humble 25 years old HDB EA.  Wife wanted to keep up with the Jones while he is happy where he is, debt free with close to a million in blue chips and 3 overseas holidays a year.  You get the drift.... 
 

Sorry if above is not your case (I may just have made an ass out of you and me by assuming too much). But I have heard so many such stories recently.  The 5 years bull run in property prices is making us ever more wealth conscious and material minded, you stay in a HDB, you are a freaking failure (every conversation is about property, a friend who recently came back from States for a short holiday lamented).  Such is life in Singapore.  
 

MBT's failure and it affects thousands (my friend is the minority, I think) and even a little of the social fabric of Singapore.

Good for you, got a wife who can help in that dept.

Lucky for me as I had secured a 4rm SK bto(92sqm)  in end 2011.....will be ready ard 3rd quarter of 2015. Hope my current Woodlands 5rm hdb will exceed 600k ( now ard 510-540).... I bought my current 5 rm hdb (122sqm with balcony) in 1999......and if can sell at 600k then I profit ard 200k only (after deduct all CPF and Outstanding loans)
 

Luckily I will have my SK 4rm ready in 2 yr times and the price I pay was less than 300K(even thought i had to pay 45k levy) but now the area ard there can fetch more than 550k n I think its worth it............b4 I move in I had already had good profit. Hope my Woodlands unit got FT offering super good price( let me know if got rich FT)....the higher the better! Then I will huat ah!

Profit =Selling price - ( CPF a + incurred interest) - (CPF b + incurred interest)- (HDB outstanding loans) 
 

Lets qoute an example......
 

Profit = 600000-( 150000+130000+130000)

           = 600000-410000

           = 190000 
 

Somemore must pay agent 1.5%.....190000-9000=181000......
 

So for sellers .....pls bear in mind that formula.  Not the selling deduct the purchase price! Anyway, im not property agent.

cpf accrued interest is also your money ... it's just went back to cpf a/c

it's still profit made ... just not for cash out

money return to cpf a/c can be used for subsequent property ... re-invest

I'm also in the same situation as u, will be selling my flat in around 3 years' time. Yes we will still profit from capital appreciation but u better don't hope for prices to go up, because it won't, it will only go down. I think by then u should only be able to sell for around $480K, or maybe even $450K.

Won't happen in the short term, maybe more taxes on HDB rental income and govt to build more rental flats, our scholars are expert on such measures.  I think it is unfair why private property owners cannot buy HDB while HDB owners can buy private.  I hope they can allow me to buy resale. I also want to laze around and collect rent (5% yield or more) for a living...

If hdb cannot be rented out then those with private properties huat... But I serious doubt so. 
 

Although I don't own a hdb but I think those who gloat at those that couldn't rent out their hdb as narrow minded. There are people with private properties that are renting out the flats for additional income, and they are also people who only have a flat and are renting out the flatand staying with parents at another flat bec needs that aadditional income to get pass bec of high cost of living.. seriously who would wanna rent out the only matrimonial home and forgo the privacy if they have an option?

U sound like u had challenges.. everyone had challenges before. I had lost 7 years of savings in 2006 and had to restart my life.. nearly went bankrupt and thankfully I had financial help from my mom and wife who is more prudent, and thankfully I had a hdb and rented out with income to sustain for a while. Thank god I am blessed and managed to get a job and did well in it, managed to save a sum of $ and also managed to sell the flat out for a tiny profit and get another 2 with my wife's insistence on riding the up turn market and sold one off with a quite a handsome profit in less than 2 years.
 

Some friends said I am very lucky, some said I am blessed. I just know that I am very very positive in my thinking even at the darkest time, and that had a positive impact on my work results. 
 

There's a saying that rich people gets richer... My interpretation is positive people attracts positive things and results simply bec every s--t things that are thrown in my face I also view as it could be worse and I am thankful that it's not that bad.. and when the not so bad things came along, it just gets better and better. 
 

I hope that u can start to see things positively.. and how one see things positively is talk positive, act positive and naturally will think positive. If u r in business, having the positive vibes is the more very very important. 
 

All the best Skunk.

I think a 4 room flat is around 450k to 600k for more matured estate. And its dependant on the age of the flat, and it's resale flat not BTO.

Was hoping that they lift rules so that unlimited HdBs can be purchased by private property owners.

At the point of my hdb purchase, I have considered the restrictions. But becos of me running a business, I have to get a hdb in case I get into trouble and  have my private prop repossessed. 

Your last sentence is precisely my key consideration back then.

clementi, ang mo kio, toa payoh, bishan, redhill = no $1M no sell

suburb 99LH condo = no $1.5M no sell ... experts say one
 

there is hardly poor people in singapore.

you sell hdb, minus outstanding loans, minus this and that ... you should have $200K+-

but .... it's inside cpf ... can see cannot touch 

you will feel rich (not poor) when you see your cpf statement

Not suan siao lah

Was thinking if restrictions are lifted, i immediately swoop in and buy 4 or 5 HDB units since each one only about $300k , then I  rent out for my retirement mah....... 

I also Singaporean leh.

I also do NS one leh

i pay significant income tax leh....
 

Must allow me to earn back , right?
 

有来有去 mah.....
 
 

I hope they lift restrictions for Singaporeans to buy as many HdB as they want as long as in full cash....



 

i also want, please leave some for me hor   [laugh]

PM Lee's example of the BTO flat in SK that costs less than $200k are standard 2 room and 3 room flats. If you talk about those higher class BTO flats like those at punggol waterway, I highly doubt those units sell for less that $200k. In fact, one of my relatives recently booked a BTO 4 room at punggol waterway for $340k.
 

As usual, politicians like to use relatively 'cheaper' flats to define what they mean by affordability. Of course, if someone belongs to the lower income groups, then these are the type of flats you should buy, not some brand new BTO in mature housing estates which will cost at least $300k.

If there is no incentives SC given to purchasing of BTO, single able to to buy BTO. 

High cost for PRs to buy resale ( because of the levy) .

Demand of resale flats will be dampen. 
 

Why will resale cheong ?
 

If new flats in punggol going for 340k (99yr lease)... it does not make senses to purchase similar resale for 600-800k with a shorter lease. The only problem was the waiting time, but government will provide rental units during the wait.
 

I think punggol and SK units will drop 10-20%.

you forgot one LETHAL weapon to hold HDB resale price

that is called valuation ... resale flat smelly smelly $400k-$500k

else how to justify new BTO at $300k-$350k benchmarking resale flat?
 

hdb bto and resale price must stay ... 

the ingenious way is "subsidy" and subsidy is not out of pocket money ... just a debit/credit column in the book
 

BTO = X = Y * 0.7

Resale HDB = Y

EC = Z = Y * 1.3

Private Condo = Z * 1.3

i dare say ... that is how it works
 

BTO = X = Y * 0.7

Resale HDB = Y

EC = Z = Y * 1.3

Private Condo = Z * 1.3



 

Valuation is based on last transaction. it's a moving gauge. 

Under the new environment, i dont see how valuation will stay at $400k-500k with bto is 300-350k and no strong demand

Willing seller and willing buyer.. bro.. there is no hard benchmark.

2. oh yeah, i saw some ads like firesale and sell below valuation ... that's because the valuation is sibei obscene high ... sell below valuation still laughing to the bank

Bro.. you forgot EC buyers.. they are force to sell.
 

Once some units are selling below valuation.. the overall valuation will drop eventually..

bro ... you forgot 6.9M population ... the demand is sibei strong

btw, i still see sticker on my hdb lift lobby ... simi genuine buyer willing to pay $30k-$50k cov and the best sticker is ... just obtain new citizen and want to get grant ... sure buy
 

and there is a reaffirmation that there is no reduction in FT/PR/EP intake ... just slowing down the growth rate
 

based on the ND Rally ... my take home message is
 

1. BTO will remain affordable for low income group = yes = subsidy
 

2. HDB price will sustain and continue to rise = yes = increased population
 

1&2 are the no 1 feedbacks in OSC ... one group want cheap and another group want price to go higher and higher

its good that nobody is expecting a global crash/slowdown, as that goes to show history will prob repeat again in future n catch everyone offguard. so far it has been almost 5yrs since 2009 bottom n most investors r getting complacent. lets see how long mr market sucks more pple in again before eating pple up again.
 

rem its not abt short term gain, its long term capital protection n growth.

You haven't read that 10-year US treasury notes has risen from 1.6% pa to above 3% pa in the last few months?   If it crossed 4%pa and it is supposed to be a risk free rate,  monies will start to flow out and liquidity will dry up a little and that may push banks to curtail their lending and up their pricing.  In fact  I think monies is already flowing out.   So you are a little behind the curve.

if the stock mkt is all u r looking for, then i better watch out. Look at our n global GDP growth rates since 2009, look at recent asian short term credit rates, basically the tapering fear has made the asian rates mkt haywire. A good fear indicator is the REITs, look at how yields have expanded n pricing in rising short US$ rates. Fear alone, not reality can kill mkts. 
 

To me even if tapering is delayed to December, which is my guess, US FEd cannot stop the world from slowing down into global recession.
 

10 Year Bond Yields
 

May vs August
 

Brazil 2.6% v 4.6%

Indonesia 5.4% v 8.4%

India 7.1% v 9.2%

Russia 6.4% v 7.6%

S Korea 2.7% v 3.7%
 

GDP Growth 2013 vs 2007
 

China 7.5% vs 14%

India 5.5% vs 10%

Singapore 2.6% vs 8.2%

Hong Kong 3% vs 6.9%

Malaysia 5% vs 7%

Taiwan 3% vs 6.5%

sorry dont understand. tapering means usa economy doing well, and would buy and import, boosting global economy and manufacturing, altho pull money out of asia and bric. so how come recession when rationally, usa getting better and out of recession?

if US can pull whole world, then how u explain BRICs n emerging mkts every yr falling GDP growth rates since 2009? 
 

to me US QE created a massive asset bubble outside of the US, so when US finally stops printing so much, the outside bubble deflation can feel like or even be a global recession. 
 

FYI 90% of my stocks r US based/US$ denominated, but now buying asian growth stocks liao. Look at vietnam philipines indonesia, all their stock mkts recently crashed like xiao,

at the end of the day, still have to wait for the lifting of ABSD to make any purchases worthwhile. no need to speculate when to enter market really cos only when govt relaxes ABSD, then that's a sure sign that (market is bad) and it's time to buy. only thing to prepare is ensure ready liquidity.

If want to be fair, dont allow HDBs to be rented out at all.
 

Imagine this, i buy HDB with grants and then after staying some years i use the HDB as profit churning tool by renting it out while i buy a private property to stay in.
 

Totally against all principles of HDB.  Knn can use public grants to buy and yet can make money.

Fair my dick.

HDB = Too Big to Fail.
 

Biggest HDB debt issuer = garmen.
 

Biggest consumer debt = HDB debt.
 

Vicious circle OK? Fuahahaha
 
 

Frankly i wld like to see wat garmen does if we go thru another asian crisis. Back then HDB resale prices fell alot together private prop. 
 

If HDB rental yields compress to say 3%, will they artificially prop up prices to increase political popularity? If so, who wld want to buy HDB resale flats if private is also 3%? Too Big to Fail yahahahah

I'm not talking about current situation.
 

I am saying if they had been steady and firm, 

bot from open market also cannot be allowed becos subsidies are already in built into the cost of construction etc...

basically as long as HDB it cannot be allowed to be a money making tool, otherwise really  

mei dao li..... 
 

only for own stay, period.
 

If that had been the case, I can guarantee that the open market price that you have paid would be a lot less, dont you think?

Errr, I cannot agree with those highlighted leh. Anyway, this is moot because we will never know what is the real cost in building an unit of flat.

I am ok with the market price I paid, and in my calculation, is "fair" based on prevailing market conditions. If the price tanked, I blame myself. 
 

As for money making, I supposed it is a yes or no answer. Some of us are merely planning towards financial freedom, and doing it in accordance with prevailing rulings. Isn't that what our government has been advocating - financial planning and responsibility?

Whatever it is, I believe it is quite impossible for the governent to do anything now. If the goverment is to do a major policy changes, i guess yr 2016 will be an interesting year.
 

I do agree with what Throttle2 had said in some points but there are 2 sides of the story. I believe it should be case by case basic. for those who are seriously in finanical situations, renting out of the spare rooms or flats will be a good income for them. Not everyone have food on the table in a society like SG. Only the rich gets richer, the poor... wait a min.. do we still care abt them?

think wider and deeper .... the entire property market is a huge "food chain"
 

if people cannot monetise from hdb sale ... how to upgrade to ec/pc > how to fulfill the aspiration of 5C
 

if people cannot monetise from hdb rental ... where to find extra money to invest extra property > land sales will crash
 

if hdb is cheap and good ... what is the price level for ec and pc to be no $1M no talk for ulu ulu place and $1500psf coming soon > gdp down
 

if PR cannot buy hdb ... who is going to foot the bill > how to raise sporean net asset value to smelly smelly $250K or $500k
 

now ... the one and only method is grant and extended grant to "targeted" buyer only. hence it does not affect the entire food chain at all ...

Yes... I dont get any subsidies when I got my own flat after going through a rough stage of my life... but i do see my neighbours are mostly PR INDIANS proudly owning HDB and selling them when they want go back for good. Allowing PRs to buy HDB is a bad decision made by MIW when those PRs are not thinkiing of staying for long...
 

Beside... Cash is king.... SG pple only asset rich but not cash rich except for pple in MCF... So many rich pple over in this forum...

if people cannot monetise from hdb sale ... how to upgrade to ec/pc > how to fulfill the aspiration of 5C
 

if people cannot monetise from hdb rental ... where to find extra money to invest extra property > land sales will crash
 

if hdb is cheap and good ... what is the price level for ec and pc to be no $1M no talk for ulu ulu place and $1500psf coming soon > gdp down
 

if PR cannot buy hdb ... who is going to foot the bill > how to raise sporean net asset value to smelly smelly $250K or $500k
 

now ... the one and only method is grant and extended grant to "targeted" buyer only. hence it does not affect the entire food chain at all ...



 
 

So are we better today? Or before?

Valuation up, but inflation lagi up. 

And salary cant catch up.

Either hold on to your property for dear life

Or sell and leave.

Some worse, need to take big debt to buy.....

the PRs make the sporean who own the flat previously become millionaires or rich ... buy $300k sell $600k or close to $1M for matured estate

we detest the PRs selling the HDB and return home but what about the sporean whom had profited from the deal?
 




Yes... I dont get any subsidies when I got my own flat after going through a rough stage of my life... but i do see my neighbours are mostly PR INDIANS proudly owning HDB and selling them when they want go back for good. Allowing PRs to buy HDB is a bad decision made by MIW when those PRs are not thinkiing of staying for long...

coin has 2 faces ... not everything is perfect

i got relatives and friends bought bungalows in iskandar too ... got personal swimming pool and garden and koi pond ... beginning sibei shiok ... 

then lesser and lesser spent time in iskandar and looking for every opportunity to sell whenever possible
 

to have big & luxury & affordable and SAFE home .... look at your neighbour ... indonesia, philipines, thailand, malaysia ... possible?

Bro ask you a point... If you have a Sporean making a profit and yet contributing to the Singapore society, a true blood Sporean paying his dues to the nation, serve NS, eat the same food as we normal folks do.. and still concerns abt SG.. I have no issues on it.. face it bro.. everywhere.. there will have people who are richer and also pple who are poor.
 

But if u look at another view, you have A PR who enjoys the same f--king benefits, dont need go NS, get the same f--king pay as us and yet tries to push their way around at times... dont care abt SG, PACK AND GO WHEN SG IS IN DEEP s--t... yet enjoys the profits of selling or renting HDB... ask you.. who u side with.. true blood SG or PR who leave n go...
 

Lastly, the surge in HDB pricing is partly caused by MIW Who sold the land at a high prices and also PRs who are cash rich.. pushes up the demands...

Are those who wants to sell mostly investors drawn by the marketing strategies of the developers, bought those units and now waiting to sell for a profit..?
 

Those who bought the units for residential purposes... they are enjoying life.. of course, there will be times where securities are compromises.. If your main pt is abt security, SG is a good place to stay PROVIDED you are cash rich... else it is a miserable place to stay..
 

IMO, I rather stay in a place ..quiet, simple and big house that I dont need to wory abt paying when I GROW OLD as the houses are cheap than staying in HDB or CONDO.. huge debts and worry abt losing a job and whether the bank will come after me if I failed to make payment... lastly... hahah... having my true blood government asking his own citizens to consider staying in JB for retirement..
 

Dont u think it is a sad case to hear that? hahaha

Sure.. leave door wide open and still safe? My only thoughts are that.. you should travel around more.. The news that you saw on the TV... it is reported big times by our controlled media to emphansis how safe is SG..
 

SG is a small place.. it is easy to control and we paid millions to the government for their SALARY.. if u have a place like china, indonesia, thailand.. news like this are normal..
 

My Main pt is when you are living in SG, you properly think that elsewhere... crimes are happening everyday and everywhere and all the times to every poor souls living in those countries except SG.. bro .. you are wrong..
 

Been to mainly countris, yes.. it is not as orderly as in SG,, but hey... I dont get so much stress when I work there... I see pple more on the friendly side. I see my neighoburs having family gatherings... and enjoying their pace of life at that place... U are wrong to think that just because of some negative news... SG is a good place to stay if u are rich.. else it is a bad place for the old and the poor... maybe it will not affect you cause u are rich... i only work as a floor sweeper.. cannot compare.

apvman,
 

i agree with your points. hence, my philosophy is simple. nothing is free ... all good things have to be paid for
 

one point that i don't agree is PR taking the advantage. it needs 2 hands to clap.

sell hdb want $50k-$100k cov ... no $1M no talk ... that time open arm wide wide to welcome PR

after that detest PR for not sunking root in spore and return homeland ... that's what PR means ... they are not citizen ... they have rights to return homeland
 

blame the policy and don't detest PR who sell their HDB ...

seriously, if policy ban PR to buy HDB ... do you think you will hear more kaypoh from sporean or PR?

there are still plenty of sporean waiting to cash out their hdb especially the mature estate like clementi, ang mo kio, toa payoh, bishan, etc all feel like sitting on a goldmine ... no $1M no talk

Whatever it is, I believe it is quite impossible for the governent to do anything now. If the goverment is to do a major policy changes, i guess yr 2016 will be an interesting year.
 

I do agree with what Throttle2 had said in some points but there are 2 sides of the story. I believe it should be case by case basic. for those who are seriously in finanical situations, renting out of the spare rooms or flats will be a good income for them. Not everyone have food on the table in a society like SG. Only the rich gets richer, the poor... wait a min.. do we still care abt them?



 

That's the govt's way of social assistance. Helping pple buy hdb. no $, then rent out a room. 

if 2 room flat then LL

yes. slower pace of live means "lower competition"
 

lower competition on coe

lower competition on property

lower competition on P1 registration / childcare

lower competition on MRT

lower competition on goods and services
 

since lower competition no need higher pay ... because cost of living rise 2x faster than pay

even higher pay ... can we catch up with current coe, property, daily cost of living, etc ?
 

home, car and daily cost of living take out majority of the pay liao ... earn $5K spent $4.5K

c. Pinoy - Good thing abt them is that they are caring if u have a phinoy gf and they love suck cocks. Other than that.. Nothing worth to mention abt them

Huh? But during my dad's time, money in, money out, not much saving at all. Pace is very slow then. Now people want this, want that, how not to be competitive. I still think it depend on individual, how much you want reflect on how competitive you are.
 

Want slower pace of live, live 3 room flat, don't drive car. It is actually not that difficult and it is just a mindset of people.

even one don't want to spend lavishly ... society progress by itself

just like you can't buy a no frill phones or you walk in to courts or best denki ... the tv available is 3D LED LCD

even HDB progress with time ... can't give you back the no frill brick and mortar only ... new design new fittings new concept with landscape bla bla bla ... all comes at a cost

last time i go to school ... $1 pocket money like sibei huat liao ... now what $1 can do? can a kid go to school with $1?

please don't say last time
 
 

just ask yourself can you live like last time ... aka your dad's time
 

a. no mobile phone

b. no tv subscription

c. no washing machine - handwash dirty clothes

d. baby use re-cycle diaper that clean/wash and reuse instead of disposable

e. etc etc

more like "we" have gotten too complacent n over reliant frm property as d 1 n only way of creating wealth. Instead of spending time starting a biz or engineering something innovative, "we" spend all our time surfing property sties comparing rental rates n transacted prices n yields. Totally unproductive n basically created a bubble in property itself.
 

IMO property is commodity which has cyclical bulls n bears, just dont get caught at d wrong end of d wrong cycle.

Hi pal,

I agree and disagree with your saying 有饭吃饭，胡粥喝粥.
 

How many of us here are willing to eat porridge once we have tasted rice?
 

It's always easier said than done! Try using a Nokia 388 or Motorola StarTac...

Can call, can Msg also... But how many here are willing to drink this "porridge"?
 

My upmost respect to those who can after driving for years liao, then can

have no alms about giving up their ride and take public transport juz for family sake.

chipping in my 2 cents worth.

All the subsidies worked into the construction are off set by the high HDB price now. A normal hdb flat cement mortar only need $100k to build. HDB profited 300% to 400%. 

Anyway Singapore allow foreigners to park their money here, how singaporeans going to fight? 

Regarding rental, the govt really need to change this policy or else how to keep public housing at bay? in other countries, public housing are only for the very poor and it make up less then 5% of the pop. Singapore 80% are public housing but make it looks like private housing, what a joke.

more like "we" have gotten too complacent n over reliant frm property as d 1 n only way of creating wealth. Instead of spending time starting a biz or engineering something innovative, "we" spend all our time surfing property sties comparing rental rates n transacted prices n yields. Totally unproductive n basically created a bubble in property itself.
 

IMO property is commodity which has cyclical bulls n bears, just dont get caught at d wrong end of d wrong cycle.



 

haha stock market also what.

Yeah some of the wealth gets redistributed to real companies. But ultimately a very unproductive outcome in terms of real productivity.

i think in general, the people cannot accept it. In a sense, HDB provided the bare basic level so many years ago. Now everyone is asking for more than that. just a fact of life.

So many youngsters now don't even know what a HDB looks like. Lol ask why ceiling so low...

Owning a car is like taking drugs. U become addicted and keep wanting to have it. I seldom see ppl sell car and taking public transport, and even if they do, they will fall back into car ownership after few years. So tell me, is car ownership is good milking machine for the govt? They know very well that no matter how much petrol cost, ERP, COE, ppl will still find ways to own a car here.

singapore personal direct tax is one of the lowest for a developed country. 

that's how we can attract multi-millionaires like jim roger and facebook co-founder savarin move to singapore.
 

yeah direct tax is low but indirect tax make up for it. 

the richer you are the more indirect tax you kena unless you stay humbly in a resale HDB and don't buy car don't buy luxury goods lor ... LOL

agreed. hence, there is a premium social cost to be paid for such "quality" life

i read an article that many see property, car, food, etc cost as how much in dollars and cents

but there is a premium social cost attached to it

why people don't move to thailand, vietnam, indonesia, philipines, where things are cheaper ... there is nothing you cannot get there ... 

you can buy a 10,000 sqft bungalow, the latest 3D largest TV, the latest smartphones, lamboghini/ferrari, etc

it's cheap ... but the country is not stable, security is bad, environment is not good, pollution, the community, etc

Todays news says more hdb homes being sold with 0 COV...looks like Khaw and team has done it
 
 

More HDB resale flats being sold with zero COV


 

SINGAPORE: More people are selling their Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats in the resale market without a cash premium.
 

The Singapore Real Estate Exchange (SRX) said transactions involving zero Cash-Over-Valuation (COV) have more than tripled, from 14 in January to 49 in July.
 

The overall median COV dipped to a low of S$20,000 in July, the lowest since 2011.
 

SRX now said it is seeing more people selling their flats even below that level - without any cash premium.
 

Zero-COV transactions made up 1 per cent of all HDB resale transactions in January.
 

This went up to 3.9 per cent in July, and 5.7 per cent in August so far.
 

There have been 32 zero-COV transactions recorded by SRX in August so far.
 

On a yearly basis, zero-COV transactions made up 1.7 per cent of all HDB resale transactions in 2011, compared to 1.9 per cent in 2012.
 

From January till now, zero-COV transactions made up 2.1 per cent of all HDB transactions.
 

Christine Li, head of research and consultancy at OrangeTee, said: "Previously, I think it took about four to six weeks to close the deal. But now, it is taking longer. Some can be as long as four months.
 

"A lot of sellers are still asking for high COVs, but the buyer pool is shrinking because of the January cooling measures as well as the ramp up in BTO (Build-to-Order) supply.
 

"The seller actually has to compete with the BTOs to offer buyers the same kind of deals they can look for in the market."
 

According to SRX data, from the beginning of the year till July, 164 zero-COV transactions were recorded
 

The top five towns that have seen the most zero-COV transactions are Jurong West, Hougang, Woodlands, Punggol and Sengkang.
 

These are places where new BTO projects were launched by the HDB in the past year.
 

Property analysts have said that even though HDB resale flats are being sold with zero cash premium at valuation level, property sellers are still likely to make a profit from their transaction.
 

Nicholas Mak, executive director for research and consultancy at SLP International Property Consultants, said: "If they were to have bought their flats brand new from the government, they would have bought it at a price that is below the current market price. Or even if they were to buy it as resale flats five years ago, during the financial crisis, chances are they would have bought it at a price that is cheaper than today."
 

With more residential units being completed this year, analysts said more sellers can be expected in the HDB resale market.
 

So more zero-COV transactions can be expected, and even some negative-COV transactions as well.

Transactions without COV is up... However, how about the valuation itself?.. if last year a flat at example blk 123 of location has a valuation of 500k.. and with a 20k cov.. the transact price is 520k. Maybe one year later, another unit at blk 123 has a valuation of 550k, and transact without COV, that would mean the transaction price is 550k. 
 

Therefore must take into account what's real price increase of decrease. 
 

In 2008/09, I sold my flat for a cov of 20k... Now the same flat may transact at zero or a loss, but valuation would have creep up to much more that even if new buyer come, they may feel shiok abt not needing to pay cov, but in reality they may pay the same or more than last year.

You are spot on!

Cov has to go down or 0!
 

But valuation will go up

It's a gimmick Ty trying to act to control the cov situation

valuation may be up with 0 COV but many do not mind
 

because COV cannot take loan 
 

but higher valuation means can take higher loan and pay using CPF

Valuation followed the past transaction price of similar properties.

Thus, COV represents the difference between previous price and present price. 
 

lower COV= slower appreciation of house price

0 COV= stagnation in house price

-ve COV=declining house price

yeah, in the bad days, all the EAs & EMs all selling below valuation 40-60K, then slowly bring the price down.

better grab any offer that has +cov.. before the valuation goes down..
 

another thing hor.. my young relatives who initially wanted to get resale.. now considering to get bto and rent from government instead.. because of the new grant.
 

Now in the resale mkt only left singles and condo downgraders..

Change hdb for hdb very few because of the big cash outlay ( due to the levy) 

HDB upgraders also fewer... 

PR not buying also.. all aiming to get SC then buy. 
 

SK / Punggol area will be quite badly hit because BTO/EC all there.

Summary
 

The government has introduced more measures to stabilise the HDB resale market, among them the maximum tenure for HDB housing loans will be cut from 30 years to 25 years and the Mortgage Servicing Ratio will also be reduced from 35% to 30% of a borrower's gross monthly income. 
 

SINGAPORE: The government has introduced further measures to stabilise the HDB resale market.
 

The maximum tenure for HDB housing loans will be reduced from 30 years to 25 years.
 

It's aimed at ensuring financial prudence in the purchase of public housing and discourage over-consumption.
 
 

The Mortgage Servicing Ratio will also be reduced from 35 per cent to 30 per cent of the borrower's gross monthly income.
 
 

In tandem, the Monetary Authority of Singapore will also make similar arrangements for the tenure of new housing loans and re-financing facilities granted by financial institutions for the purchase of HDB flats.
 
 

Separately, Singapore permanent resident households with no citizen owner will have to wait three years from the date of obtaining PR status before they can buy a resale HDB flat.
 
 

Previously, they can buy a resale flat immediately after obtaining their PR status.
 
 

This will apply to resale applicants received from 5.30pm Tuesday.

3yrs got effects meh , might as well ban PRs from buying HDB . Why applying to convert to SC need to think for donkee years  , but come to buy HDB no need second thought ?

imho,

HDB resale will go down because of the skew policies which (A) limit buyer and (B) increase supply. 
 

(A) limit buyer 

1. PR now cannot by until 3rd yr.  But PR may turn to the lower-end apartments because of their CPF contribution. It make no sense for them to continue renting with cash, when they can pay a loan using cpf. Those that has $$ for initial down payment will turn to pte resale. 

2. Younger generation turning to BTO because of the increase grant

3. Single turning to BTO because they are eligible now.

4. HDB change HDB (upgraders or downgraders ), larger cash outlay because of the buyer stamp duty which they , of course, can claim back after a few mths. 
 

(B) increase supply

TOP EC , hdb upgrader force to sell.

TOP BTO , hdb upgrader/downgrader force to sell.
 

As for pte resale, it may continue to be stable because 

1) owner wont sell if their expected price is not there.. and not forced to sell

2) those that bought 4 yrs ago still can get decent rental return. 

3) owner wont sell because replacement cost is high. They need to pay  buyer stamp duty if they are selling their >=2nd unit.

4) there are hdb owners who has fully paid their hdb, looking for a good buy. 
 

Actually I wont be surprise that lower-end apartments will go up. 
 

One thing we cannot forget , so many pigeons go into so many holes.. as long as there is no change to 6.9 mil policies. It's like buying cars .. government can put in the policies to prevent ppl from over-leveraging causing the resale mkt to "crash"  but new  car still so expensive.. cos' there are still ppl that pay their new car in full.

For the first time since 2003, buyers with HDB addresses accounted for the bulk of demand (53 percent) in the new private homes market last year, according to a DTZ report.  

“In the primary market, the number of private homes bought by HDB addressees rose 34 percent in 2012 to 9,380 units while the number of private homes purchased by private addressees rose a smaller four percent to 8,239 units.”
 

On the other hand, the resale market saw purchases by flat owners slip by two percent to 5,224 units, compared to those with private addresses which dropped nine percent to 10,331 units.
 

“The stronger demand from purchasers with HDB addresses could be due to rising HDB resale prices which make private housing more affordable for HDB upgraders. Some of these buyers with HDB addresses could also have kept their HDB flat for rental, which would help to support the mortgage payments for the private home in the current low interest rate environment,” the report noted.

There are two types of PRs. Just like there are two types of SC

The ones who buy resale HdB and the ones who buy condos.
 

These in your example above do not buy resale HdBs
 

Dont mix them up leh.....

You cannot get shxt at all!
 

The moment you own more than one properties, no matter what HDB flat you stay, you get a big FAT ZERO as far as benefits are concerned.
