in all honestly, the picture is actually very true! All Tampines people are in debted to MBT. In 1995, my dad shifted to tampines. i was a ns boy then. tampines was a dead town. In a period of 10 years, MBT developed Tampines by bringing in tampines financial centre and also the changi business hub. tampines prospered. So indeed MBT is Tampines' gof of fortune.

She added: "This is a great contradiction to HDB's role which is to offer affordable housing to the masses," however she was quick to add that homes in Singapore are more affordable than Hong Kong which earned a rating of 12.6.
 

The HDB was contacted for an official statement but were unable to issue any comment prior to publication.



 

making money is top government priority....not the welfare of the people.....

Never ever listen to all those agents. Their answers are always : there is never a wrong time to buy, got lots of capital appreciation (even though) prices are at the peak), rental yield is good etc.... They only hv one objective, that is to sell u the unit.

TCSS only! I wouldnt be bothered to read such a lengthy piece of sh*t. Where are the housing policies which are going to be fairly adjusted for the singles who dont intend to get married or those singled again from their divorce?
 

Family nuclei is inevitably an important for social conhesiveness and social stability, but will that mean that singles are not important to the society. Does that mean singles are not contributing to the society? Dont they need a roof as a form of basic need? Isn't that one of those super basic needs ?(Quoting from The Heirachy of Needs of simple human kinds on earth. I mean alive, breathing, working ?)

Assumming, there is no problem with loan and cpf amt, 

if i buy a EM@625+40k, cov 40k, cash payment is 625x0.5 +40 =  71.25k.

If i buy a condo@1mil, cash payment is only 50k.

I understand why there is COV.. an its a necessary evil. It's just that just by looking can cash upfront. Pte is more "affordable". Assuming that loan repayment is not a problem. 

In today's condition, even if you have cash to pay off the whole house. It's still better to loan to max as interest rate is at low 1-2%.. Typical investment will give you a decent 4%, even cpf also give you more at 2.5%. So the less cash is better no matter how you see. 
 

Pte value and hdb value is different.. like buying watermelon from jap and buying watermelon from malaysia.

Lord Turner: FSA to cap mortgage borrowing

Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, will also declare a ban on 100 per cent mortgages Photo: JULIAN SIMMONDS
 

As part of a wide-ranging package of announcements for banking regulation following the near-collapse of the financial system, Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, will also declare a ban on 100 per cent mortgages.
 

In all but the most exceptional circumstances, it will become "normal practice" again for loans to limited to a maximum of three times the borrower's salary.

As you just said 2nd timer, that means they have sold their first HDB. They also collect COV from their sales right? So fair fair mah.
 

I think the taxing ones are those first timer who want to buy resale flat at their choice location.

this is crappy governance.
 

singles don't contribute to country?  for many singles, being single may not be by choice.  would they rather singles force themselves to get married only to regret later and have dysfunctional family latter who will place more stress on the society?  therein lies the incongruity that divorcee may also contribute kids that are currently in shortage of in singapore.
 

actually if the tweak the rules to singles buying hdb flat, they will cater for divorcees as well.  the younger divorcees not qualified to buy hdb flat  are typically age around 30.  the older divorcees would not have a problem buying flat given their age.

Singles can buy HDB flat when they reach 35 years old. althought not BTO (not sure if this rules had change.) They can also buy a BTO flat with one of their parents if they want to get BTO flat or but earlier than 35 years old.
 

speaking of contribution heard from some finance ppl, family does bring more contribution to the overall economics of a country compare to singles. (not i say one hor.)

i know the rules,  what i am saying is it doesn't make sense.
 

as for the reserarch that family brings mroe contribution to a country, it is true.  but conversely if you force people to get into dynfunctional marriages, it will also cost the economy much more.  hence i always believe that such ways of discouraging singles does have its ramifications.
 

also their policies is also not exactly just encouraging marriage.  they are in fact encouraging people to get married early.  people that get married and set up family past a certain age doesn't get any benefit, instead they have to pay more.

Depend on what angle you are looking at..
 

assuming they allow single to buy flat anytime they want with no age restriction, you will suddenly see that marriage couple with family which already find it very hard to get a BTO will have even lesser chance than now to buy a BTO. And they not only have to fight with PR for resales, they have to fight with singles too. making the whole housing issue even worse.
 

Another concern is ppl who are going better to do might buy flats for themself first before registering for married, effectively mean they own two HDB flats.
 
 

As for forcing themself into unwanted marriaged and end up divorce, its really their mentality of marriage that is causing the divorce. Most treat Marriage as a contract instead of a live time commitment.

the scenario you are citing also happens now even with such rules.  people who want to find loopholes to the rule will always find out how.  such rules only bind the hapless and rule abiding citizen.
 

and of course, the shortage of housing is also partly caused by allowing married PR or even sibling pr to buy.  if they have too little housing to give singaproean singles, shouldn't they jsut stop allowing pr to buy.
 

of course for marriage, the people involve does have the bigger responsibility to whether it works.  but there are definitely couples that go into wrong marriage due to rush to get the roof. i have seen cases before and i am sure there will continue to be such cases.

I am suggesting it could be worse without those rules.
 

Yeah i agree with what you had mention. but human will always find loop hole, this cannot be avoided. However, making no restriction will cause a problem too. ppl will be complaining why single are buying flat leaving the ppl with family having problem in finding a roof?? 
 

Ultimately, Government can only create restriction with their policy, and tweet the policy to cover loop hole when it had been discovered over time. PR is a issue which we all agree they should solve.
 

As for marriage, no one force them to get into a wrong marriage. they make the choice of weighting their decision to get marriage for the roof instead of Love/commitment to the other party, they have to face the consequence of not understand what is marriage all about. its not really fair to say the policy force them to make a wrong choice.
 

anyway, friendly conversation and exchanging of thoughts hor... no win loss here. (sorry i realise MCF ppl very sensitive. exchanging idea can become you win i win one.)

As for marriage, no one force them to get into a wrong marriage. they make the choice of weighting their decision to get marriage for the roof instead of Love/commitment to the other party, they have to face the consequence of not understand what is marriage all about. its not really fair to say the policy force them to make a wrong choice.
 

anyway, friendly conversation and exchanging of thoughts hor... no win loss here. (sorry i realise MCF ppl very sensitive. exchanging idea can become you win i win one.)




haha no hard feelings....
 

but i cannot really agree that all can be sober enough to keep marriage and housing needs seperate and not let consideration for one get into the other.  these 2 are quite closely related in the modern society.  plus a lot of such people are at the age of 20 something whereby they are still not very savvy and matured.

yeah. i agree with you on this. the problem is not help when their parents are pushing them to get a property quick...  dont know they know what is good for their children or not
 
 

i am fortunate, my parents never rush me to buy house. in fact when i want to get a house and get marriage, the first question they ask me, can afford house or not? if cannot dont buy live together first?

I don't think its good idea to stop who from buying..let market forces decide prices is best.

i know the rules,  what i am saying is it doesn't make sense.
 

as for the reserarch that family brings mroe contribution to a country, it is true.  but conversely if you force people to get into dynfunctional marriages, it will also cost the economy much more.  hence i always believe that such ways of discouraging singles does have its ramifications.
 

also their policies is also not exactly just encouraging marriage.  they are in fact encouraging people to get married early.  people that get married and set up family past a certain age doesn't get any benefit, instead they have to pay more.



 

I agreed with what you are saying. In summary, (1) many falling or fallen marriages are hanging on to their HDB. More extramarital affairs are deteriorating the moral values of the society. (2) For single to buy HDB, he/she is servicing an unit as compared to joint couple income so as to say. He/she is like paying double. 
 

And if singles are not contributing to the society, why not remove income tax on the singles and see how?

so, to HDB, only so call new BTO is "affordable" and should be use to gauge the affordability and cannot compare the open market of "resale"... ummm... is there more new BTO transaction than re-sale every year to justify the use of BTO then resale for the data collection??....

10 yrs back got surplus of HDB flats so good.easily less than 180k for a 5RM flat.now all of them looking to upgrade to condo.

from the property boom from post 2007 till now 2012,it seems like every BTO will have min of 4 times more application.where does this people comes from?and it's not that there's a lack of BTOs supply.

the applicants just sprung out from nowhere?if there is so many applicants now then why is there oversupply of flats 10years back?

not sure what makes up the numbers of applicants but there's definitely something fishy.

only sinkies can buy bto?no wonder there's more FTs converting to sinkieship.
