A five-room HDB flat at Centrale 8 in Tampines has been put on the market for a whopping S$880,000 (around $750 psf), the priciest new public flat to be released for sale under the Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) so far.
 

This comes amid efforts by National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan to prevent further increases in the price of public housing by launching up to 25,000 units this year.
 

Measuring between 1,163 sq ft by 1,173 sq ft each, the 178 five-room units at the project cost nearly twice as much as standard flats sold in the recent Build-To-Order (BTO) project in Tampines, where a 1,216 sq ft flat cost up to S$444,000.
 

Mohamed Ismail, chief executive of PropNex, said that though the flats were built by Sim Lian Group under the DBSS, the price tag is still higher than any executive condominium.
 

He admitted that he did a double take when he first heard about the prices.
 

"No doubt it's in Tampines, which is a mature estate with many good things going for it, but it is still extremely high for a public housing flat," he said.
 

Despite the hefty price tag, a report from The Straits Times showed that the developer only paid S$261 psf ppr for the 21,132 sq ft site.
 

"The premium is due to its locale in Tampines Regional Centre with mature amenities such as banks, three shopping malls and the upcoming Integrated Lifestyle Hub," said a spokesman from Sim Lian, explaining the rationale behind the high pricing.
 

PropertyGuru analyst Tejaswi Chunduri said, "According to Sim Lian Group's indicative price range for Centrale 8, the price range for a five-room flat can be anywhere between S$685,000 and S$880,000. The floor area for these flats is in the range of 1163 to 1173 sq ft."
 

She added, "This will likely increase the asking price for newly developed projects as well as for the resale flats in estates island-wide."
 

"It is also within walking distance to the existing Tampines MRT Station and the future downtown line 3 MRT interchange."
 

However, Nicholas Mak, head of research at SLP International, said in an interview with ST that, while the location is good, it does not justify the flats' astronomical price tag.
 

"Another side effect is that it might encourage resale flat sellers in the area to increase their prices, as buyers would not need to wait for their units to be built," he said.
 

Prices of HDB flats have skyrocketed due to limited supply resulting from growing demand fuelled by mass-immigration. However, Khaw noted that "sharp property price increases cannot go on forever."

if you ignore the most expensive unit of $880k, the rest of the units aint cheap either and could be even more expensive by having an assumption that the larger the unit the lower the $psf

Amazing and your household income is capped at $10k, must work entire life for a HDB roof over your head.  The whole scheme should be canned if private developers can price public flats at private housing pricing while obtaining cheap land from the government....  What is the logic? I just hear a big sucking sound.

Rich? Maybe not all.

Some will kill themselves with life-long loan, just thinking they can make a profit out of public housing. 
 

Wait for the bubble to burst and see how many jump off their flats.

Ya darn irresponsible sim lian and in fact others who bid for so high price.. This is hdb not private property. These people are not human at all.. Only think of earning $ without caring for whether the poor suffering etc.. Hope kbw can put this to stop.. 
 

these greedy developer are indirectly causing further rise in resale market which already so expensive.. What happen if in future a lot unable to pay off loan and default payment how? The consequences will be far greater and if bank affected that's it for singapore economy.. Now although the pricing to developer saying that it is still manageable but... Dun forget people will also lose job and also need to save.. No savings and lose job plus need to pay so much for loan how? I do not wish the similar scenario that has happen to usa going to happen on singapore in future. Those people that keep thinking property price will rise forever and even dun have much $ also want take loan to speculate on property and hopping to earn $ from that.. And see what happen to USA in year 2007? Haiz...

AS long as there are buyers at this price than the developer can't be blamed. It's when everybody boycotts this HDB flat then we can see what will happen next. Just don't buy....same as another thread about food that's expensive. You are the buyer/ consumer.....you can just vote with your feet.

sim lian is not irresponsible... they bid high and sell high... ppl can choose to buy or not to buy

If nobody buy then sim lian deserved it

This I agree with u.. That is why I quite piss off when dbss at tampines cost 880k. It,s not so simple as too expensive dun buy but if resale market follow trend to rise price because they think since dbss at tampines can cost 880k and still got people buy. So end up average Singaporeans buying hdb suffer. So only way to stop the trend is stop the developer to be so greed and push up price.. That's my feel.

BTO to design better flats also helps.
 

it dampens demand for DBSS.

but MBT already say he is ramping up BTO by so much. In fact he already said the new HDB launches will be much cheaper than DBSS.
 

I think he should launched a similar BTO in tampinese and priced it much lower just to send a message to everyone. 
 

After all the talk by MBT and you STILL want to buy the DBSS at tampinese.... they is nothing anyone can do.
 

Is the DBSS for sale yet? wonder what is the response like now after MBT has spoken.
 

CNA

Mr Khaw said he is working with the HDB to see how the June and July launches can be combined for a larger launch. 
 

He also pledged to price them wisely, adding that they will certainly not be near the prices suggested in the recent Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) flats.
 

He was referring to a private developer's DBSS launch in Tampines, with the upper end of the 5-room units priced at S$880,000.
 

Noting that it has caused a stir in the social media, he said the negative reaction was not surprising.
 

Mr Khaw also explained the difference between DBSS developments and mainstream public housing projects built by the HDB. 
 

He explained that DBSS is a class of housing type between HDB flats and executive condominiums/private condos.
 

DBSS forms a tiny portion of the total housing options for Singaporeans. 
 

Mr Khaw pointed out that while HDB flats are designed and priced by HDB, DBSS flats are designed and priced by private developers.
 

He said if the private developer prices it too high and there are no takers, there will be no sales.

A five-room HDB flat at Centrale 8 in Tampines has been put on the market for a whopping S$880,000 (around $750 psf), the priciest new public flat to be released for sale under the Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) so far.
 



THIS IS CRAZY!!!



 

Yup, agree that its crazy.  And HDB is what ... 99-yr leasehold only!
 

More than a decade ago, I bought 3 condo units, over a 3-year period:
 

- D.10 2-bedroom (Holland Rd) 999-yr LH at $326/sqft

- D.10 3-bedroom (Jervois Rd) FH, at $372/sqft

- D.10 3-bedroom (Coronation Rd West) FH, at $450/sqft
 

Now this bugger paid $750/sqft for a HDB flat in Tampines (D.16?)
