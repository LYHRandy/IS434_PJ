I am wonder whether the CHIJ primary schools allows children of different religion? I remember the Maha allows non Buddhist children. Are there selection criteria differ from other primary schools? 
 
I don't intend to talk too much about religion, just some research for buying a house for overseas friends.

Must be a dumb or really bad question, judging from the response it gets.

Not sure what kind of response you been getting. Singapore moe primary schools are all national schools so purely based on moe enrollment rules, no discrimination allowed.
 
However Christian school will have prayers, pastoral care, chapel time etc.  some people eyes wide open enrol  Christian school, but then want to write in to opt out of these.  School will allow, but I think it’s not good, and not good for the kid too.

I see. Thank you for the information. 
The response means the lack of response.

You must be coming from a country where multi-religion and multiracialism is not tolerated or has been forgotten. Singapore is not one such country.

Must be a dumb or really bad question, judging from the response it gets.All schools in Singapore take in students of all races, language and religion.  There are the phased entries based on parental affiliation, proximity of residence etc. ... but that cuts across all. 
HOWEVER, if you are talking about foreigners trying their luck to get into our more-prestigious schools, the new rules have changed ... and will continue to be “enhanced” to favor citizens only!

No need.  Priority given to Singaporeans within 1km for Primary school.  Secondary and JCs depend on results. 
My Malay neighbours 2 kids are in CHIJ Primary and my girl (buddhist) is in CHIJ  sec.

Actually kids from migrant families do add something to the school and do pull up the standards of those schools.  I know many parents whose kids ended up in “phase 3” schools end up liking it.   The prestigious popular schools will end up very cloistered.  I see it in my son’s school, much as the national policy for preferring Singaporeans is needed.

Why not good for the kid?

Great opportunity to teach diversity. Why everyone must be the same ?

As a parent, I won't want to send my kid to a school indoctrinated with a different religion from what I practise. I think parents should exercise some common sense when choosing schools and not seek to enforce their wants on the school.

Bro, actually I would beg to differ. Brought up by buddhist parents and attended a catholic primary and secondary, never once had I felt marginalized or pressurized into taking up catholicism. But the bible stories and gospel sharing did rouse my interest in the religion though.

Please don't think too much, just that a house I found interesting only has one CHIJ within 1km. 
If no preference then ok.

Without pointing any fingers here, i would say the catholics in singapore are not as evangelical as the christians of different denominations.
This is after attending alpha courses at catholic church, attending several churches (catholic and christian) with friends in my early 20s.
 
So i would expect attending a catholic school isn't really too uncomfortable for a free thinker/buddhist/taoist/hindu etc.

I agree.   
My daughter studys in a CHIJ school.  Catholic students have to reach school early or stay back for weekly prayers so non catholic students are not affected. 
 
Their mass is not very frequent usually on the first day of every school term during assembly.  My girl usually day dreams during the mass
