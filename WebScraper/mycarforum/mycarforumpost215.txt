I have a balance of $100K in my CPF account and i am thinking to make full payment from my CPF of 100K + cash of 50K, could someone advise me if this make sense? Can i use all the 100K in my CPF ord account for the full payment? Also i was told by UOB to get my own lawyer to settle the full payment, anyone has experience how i could go about and how much will the cost be? Does the lawyer assist in advising me how much in total i need to prepare for full settlement before i engage him/her?

Ya heard from those agents that now bank interest rate are at 1.2% but atflockrate.

So my guess is after 1 to 2 yrs, the rate went up n up to 3-4%?

Can some expert explain to us Pls.

Rates cannot stay low forever, just an advise that when taking loan also need to calculate in rising interest rate.

He probably got the loan approved back in 2007 when the pte bank rates is still about 3.25-3.50%. The thing abt these banks is that when the interest rates goes down, they dun re-adjust downwards for those who got the loan earlier. U will have to make a lot of noise before they would consider re-adjusting it back to existing market rates..

so is that mean taking HDB loan is still the best?

current rate is 2.6% thru out the whole loan period.

at the interest rate you're paying (3.75%), it definitely make sense as your CPF OA interest is much lower at 2.5%. alternatively, you could explore refinancing. bottomline, your idle cash/CPF must generate higher return than your mortgage interest rate.
 

typical lawyer conveyancing fee for HDB should not exceed $2K. you could randomly contact a few law firms from the below for comparison. yes, they should be able to advise you the total cost for full settlement before the official engagement.

I feel take hdb loan will not go wrong as no need to worry about rising interest rate. Now although bank loan interest rate is low but future hard to say.. Maybe up to 5% or more also possible.. Future hard to predict so go for safer option is better which is hdb loan.

That's my feel la. Many people will think hey.. Interest rate will not go so high 1 la.. But look at history.. Interest rate has been low for quite sometime. Once shoot up will be quite high 1.. Yr 2007 crisis interest rate at 3%+- .. Imagine what will happen when next bigger crisis hit? Hmm..

Actually, rates will stay low for at least 5 yrs.. Fed will keep the rate low till 2014. Even if the rate really raising, it will not be alot higher because off the huge sovereignty debts. 
 

Since most if not all bank loan need to be refinance after 3/4/5 yrs. Might as well take the low sor/sibor rates one. When the interest rate raise in , say 5 yrs time, even fixed will be high also.
 
 

If you are having pte , with the current poor investment environment. Seriously , it does not really matter if you pay finish or not because $$ in the bank also dun give alot of interest..Stock related investment are too violate and not for the weak-hearted :| Commodity also tanked liao. FD and double currenty have its risk and low return.. So also no point. 
 

But for hdb , it's different because hdb is a close mortgage. That is to say, you cannot gear-up if you need the extra $ .  while pte, you can.

The total CPF you use shd not be higher then the purchase price of the house in this kind of situation

For eg.  If u bought the house for 200k , paid 100 k, full settle now is 120k (because of interest)

U can only use another 100k from CPF now as the purchase price is 200k - 100k paid= 100 k.

The other 20k need to be cash 

I suggest the bet is to get a agent to help/ advise u.

I paid around $500 for lawyer to do that

Before u decide whether u wanna fully repay the uob loan, why dun u reprice with uob at maybe 1.5% rate with no lock in package? Instantly save $ on higher interest of 3.75%..
 

Negotiate them with the repricing admin fee of $300-500 see if they can waive. But if I'm in yr situation, I'll not take lock in package for a slightly lower rate of 1.2-1.3% at all.. as outstanding loan at $150k is small so interst diff between 1.2% and 1.5% is really negligible.
 

If u r savvy investor, next few months may post good opportunity ro go in market to get some good capital gains if market tank..

Lastly.. why dun need to engage lawyer for hdb case is bec hdb does not involve strata title or title deeds, as hdb is rented flat.. u can get these information from hdb website or visithdb is u willing to do some leg work.

Go the the bank to refinance since your rate now is 3.75% means u have been a loyal customer, they will gladly do it. If not tell them u go to other banks which offer around 1.5% now. All housing loan need lawyer to settle and it will also come with a fee. Usually 1k-2kplus for HDB. And if you got the means to pump in your CPF to the loan why not since you can't do much with it locked up, but I suggest set aside a small balance.

If I were you, dont bother to engage a lawyer. If you pay in full, just ask for the title deeds, though there could still be a caveat on your property. Then write to the lender to remove the caveat since he has been paid in full.

what does hedge against cpf this mean?
 

recently i was advised by a bank rm to take as much pte loan as possible and if the interest rate change to higher then cpf rates then only use bulk of cpf to clear outstanding loan. 
 

Questions on this: 

how to set aside cpf? thought automatically the cpf will wipe out?

cpf allows OA to use to clear bank loan anytime?

taking a bank loan will not wipe out your cpf as the amount of loan and cpf to used is determined by yourself. only take hdb loan will wipe out the cpf. At this current moment, it does make sense to take bank loan as rates are approximately 1.2-1.3% on the average for next 2-3 years. CPF pays you 2.5%. 2.5%-1.3%= 1.2% difference. if you have a 100k in your balance. you would have made additional $1.2k after paying off the bank interest.

dont think the word used should be hedge, hdb loan rates is pegged against CPF interest rates. their rate is +0.1% above what CPF OA is paying you.

there is a strata even for hdb. the thing is for hdb loan, you can request for your strata from them without a fee after you have cleared your loan. however for bank loans, you will need to engage the bank's panel of law firms to discharge the mortgage. normally cost 400-500.

So assuming leftover amount is 300k but i have 300k in CPF. I can leave CPF untouched and take bank loan of 300k to make use of the low interest rate now. but when the rate were to increase significantly higher then 2.5% can I immediately make a full payment using CPF? Would there be any big admin charges?
 

I was actually planning to do the above but would like to know if there would be any misc charges.

Same here, I would avoid using cash to pay off the loan. Use cpf as much as possible, having a fat cpf account no use. I don't know about hdb but I know some banks out there charges a penalty for early full repayment. Does anyone know which banks and if posb home loan? has that clause too?

I agree that if can take HDB loan cuz can use CPF account. No point having 'virtual money' that you can never see. But sometimes hdb doesn't approve your full loan. My fren only got 60% of his principal loan sum approved. Then in the end he had to take his hdb loan from dbs in order to get the 80% financing. So depends on case to case really.
