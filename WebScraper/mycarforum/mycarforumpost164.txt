Not drastic but slowly  
 



New HDB measures target mortgage servicing ratio and maximum loan tenure
The maximum repayment period for HDB housing loans will also be lowered from 30 to 25 years, and from 35 to 30 years for bank loans taken to buy HDB flats, including those under the Design, Build and Sell Scheme.
 

Three-year waiting period for PRs to buy resale flats

Newly-minted Singapore permanent residents will now have to wait three years before buying a resale public flat, instead of straightaway after they become PRs.
 

More middle-income households now eligible for Special Housing Grant

The income limit will now be $6,500, a sharp increase from the previous $2,250. This will give a financial boost of up to $20,000 for those who choose four-room flats in non-mature estates.

If this will bring down the prices of HDB flats, then I'm all for the measures. It is already a joke that our public housing needs cooling measures.

51,000 mean PR+PR or PR+SG? 
 


There were 51,000 Housing Board flats fully owned by permanent residents as of end June, representing 6 per cent of all HDB flats, said Mr Khaw in a written parliamentary reply this month. 

This year, 130 flats were sold by PRs within three years of their purchase, while 320 were sold within four years of purchase, and 490 within five years.

This will not last.... To renew PR, you need to be gainfully employed. There is also a recent restriction which I have forgotten what which disallow PR from further renting out.

I believe fully owned by PR means both husband and wife is PR. The new rule only affects this group (pure PR couple).
 

My question is if husband is 10yr PR but wife is new PR then how? Can buy?

What's interesting is the multi-generation flats - waiting to see how this is implemented, and how the pricing will be.  Also if there are any new rules to go with the bigger flats. 
 

Would love to see it such that they are tightly controlled and priced accordingly - i.e - MUST have three generation in same house now to be allowed to apply, CANNOT rent out a room etc etc - so that only very genuine multi-generation families can live, and you don't see the same farce we saw for EC where the penthouses were so stupidly expensive

no use.

correct me if i am wrong, most PR come here will not have money buy house. Effectively the 3 year waiting period is when they working and saving up money.

if they have money, they would be living a very comfortable life back in their home country and not want to come here. 
 

the reduction of loan period will hurt us.

the trick very simple one

to buy MGF (multi generation flat), the parents must sell off their flat

govt very desperate to push down the resale hdb price because 2016 cumming liao, better hurry up to submit project before deadline  

now how to sell, price going down already  

somemore these MGF is only 115sqm, 5sqm more than 5 room only?!?!?!?

Last time they tried, multi gen not popular (was also Yishun area) for EC - Multi Gen very popular - but that is (IMHO) because the oldies' flat could be rented for extra income, moreso than because people wanted multi-gen per-se. 
 

I remember when we got our flat

Gap from 4 room to 5 room was about $60k for 20 sqm (5 room at 110 sqm) 

Gap from 5 room to exec was about $120k for 20 sqm  (exec at 130 sqm) 
 

If got multi gen should be in the 130-150 sqm range I would think....
 

Extropolating a bit....with new 5 room now going for $400 plus from HDB, (twice what we paid) the jump from 5 room to multi gen would be somewhere in the $250 - $300k range, making a multi gen around $700k?  That's a tough ask for the typical "heartland" multi gen family I would think

Just too bad for them.  Policy changes is something they cannot control.  I believe even if they are to sell at valuation, they will still make a handsome profit as the price of their HDB would have appreciate quite a bit over the past few years.

Yah, too small. My mum's old 5 room has 4 bedrooms (3 + 1 study). The study room is bigger than the bedroom in my current house.  
 

Declared space is 125 sqm iirc; I think the builder under declared also.    Damn big.....
 

Why need 3 toilets? Must well build 2 toilets outside instead of inside bedroom.

After reading so many replies and even from other forum, why nobody is concern about the max 25 years loan?
 

25 years means have to pay more every month. How can this cool the market? Anyone care to enlighten this?
 

Having on average combine income of 7-8K, and a 25 years loan for a 450,000K flat, which the loan amount should be 270,000K-300,000K after 2.6% interest it will be 340K to 378K.
 

Really duu understand how can this cool the market.

Having on average combine income of 7-8K, and a 25 years loan for a 450,000K flat, which the loan amount should be 270,000K-300,000K after 2.6% interest it will be 340K to 378K.
 

Really duu understand how can this cool the market.



 

here the people is bery rich, not thinking of buying hdb, only thinking of buying pte

all thinking how to make use of the situation

3 yrs wait for new PR before they can buy HDB resale.
 

So where are they going to stay for this 3 yrs? That also means rental will be supported, or PC will be continue to rise?



 
 

that will obviously drive them to the rental hdb mkt. then more ppl will illegally sublet. then it creates a new set of problems to solve. 
 

i think that's called 'creating employment'.....

Yah, too small. My mum's old 5 room has 4 bedrooms (3 + 1 study). The study room is bigger than the bedroom in my current house.  
 

Declared space is 125 sqm iirc; I think the builder under declared also.    Damn big.....
 

Why need 3 toilets? Must well build 2 toilets outside instead of inside bedroom.

Blinking game.
 

If more people can't afford to take a higher loan, it means less people can afford the asking price. So the seller can either wait and hope for someone to bite, or lower the asking price. And with more condos reaching TOP at the end of this year and next year, more HDB flats will be put up for sale. This increased supply + the 25 yr HDB loan / 30 yr bank loan requirement will put more downward pressure on the selling price.

51,000 mean PR+PR or PR+SG? 
 

There were 51,000 Housing Board flats fully owned by permanent residents as of end June, representing 6 per cent of all HDB flats, said Mr Khaw in a written parliamentary reply this month.
 

This year, 130 flats were sold by PRs within three years of their purchase, while 320 were sold within four years of purchase, and 490 within five years.



 

yeah I get the same question hovering in my mind when they write this way.
 

how do they classify couple of pr+citizen

So, lessees of existing HDB flats, are you happy now your comprains hv been heard and that your hdb flat price will drop?



 

No point getting sad, I applauded to the change. We are blinded by greed in the beginning, if we think HDB flats are for investments. We know that HDB was founded to make sure everyone has a roof over their heads.
 

We had been misguided with promised that HDB is an asset to us. It is NOT, it is a house for us to stay in. I had never believed in EC and I'm glad I never did. I never believed in buying flats just to sell them after 5 years.
 

It is good that they have done this else it would become a property bubble waiting to burst. Nothing can be sustainable if the price keeps rising, if someone did this just to look good in their KPI then we are paying the price.
 

We have to keep price down for HDB flat to be readily available for the next generation, and generation to come. We cannot be buillding new BTO when some of the flats remains empty because it was used for property speculations to get profits.
 

I'm all hands up for this restrictions. We must set the record right. No complaint

I stayed in those jumbo at Woodlands before. There are 4 bedrooms, the master is huge.  The Kitchen is big too.
 

I think it is a combination of 4 rm flat + 3 rm flat.

Thank you for your clarification. But this will have an impact on those serious buyer (newly wed couple) How they expect young couples age 28-32 to afford? Or are they expecting them to buy 2-3 rooms only. If yes, then how can they expect to boost the population? If you know you have a small house, how many kids do you wanna have? Like last time in 70s where a family of 5-6 squeeze into 1 3 room flat, every night sleep in the living with mattress (ti Lum)?

Then buy smaller units loh. 
 

The ugly truth is, it is politically suicidal for the incumbent to crash the market. More people will be affected than just the prospective buyers. The most they can do is impose some CMs and hope for the mkt to do some correction. Long term goal is for the price to stabilise and for wages to catch up. The damage/effect caused by the runaway prices from the past few years can't be easily removed. People will just have to accept and adapt to it.

Couple 1 room. both kids 1 room. Where are the kids going to study? In the dining room? Nowadays room are so big that u cannot fit in 2 single beds except a double deck. Kids are still ok to share, but once they are in their teenage or Uni, the problem will comes in. Also not forgetting our parents. Parents do drop by and stay a few day from time to time. So ask the parents sleep in the hall. Tell them last time they bought small flat we as their kids have to sleep in the hall, now their turn huh?
 

Not being rude or attacking you. Its just that this is the hard truth. So 3 room is really not suitable for a family of 4 and with parents who will drop by, we share the responsibility in taking care of our parents by inviting them over to stay for a few months and rotate.

so you rather plunge into a heavy debt now, why can't wait till the kids reach 5-6 (plus 2 years without kids) then upgrade to a bigger flat? 
 

it is the hard truth and people have been living this way, they way you put it as if it is a hard life living in a 3 room flat. Parents has their own flat and singapore is not big. Also grandparents and grandchild bunking in a room for a night or two is not that inconvenience but it can be quite cozy for bonding.  Moreover, how old can the parents be if you are young couple with a baby or two.
 




Couple 1 room. both kids 1 room. Where are the kids going to study? In the dining room? Nowadays room are so big that u cannot fit in 2 single beds except a double deck. Kids are still ok to share, but once they are in their teenage or Uni, the problem will comes in. Also not forgetting our parents. Parents do drop by and stay a few day from time to time. So ask the parents sleep in the hall. Tell them last time they bought small flat we as their kids have to sleep in the hall, now their turn huh?
 

Not being rude or attacking you. Its just that this is the hard truth. So 3 room is really not suitable for a family of 4 and with parents who will drop by, we share the responsibility in taking care of our parents by inviting them over to stay for a few months and rotate.

What's interesting is the multi-generation flats - waiting to see how this is implemented, and how the pricing will be.  Also if there are any new rules to go with the bigger flats. 
 

Would love to see it such that they are tightly controlled and priced accordingly - i.e - MUST have three generation in same house now to be allowed to apply, CANNOT rent out a room etc etc - so that only very genuine multi-generation families can live, and you don't see the same farce we saw for EC where the penthouses were so stupidly expensive



 
 

Funny how the multi gen flats are still smaller than my current 5rm executive in Yishun.
 

I already live with 3 old ppl, wife and a maid and its barely enough space.....

Agreed with JM888
 

Buffy. 
 

That's why I mentioned the key is "adaptation". There is nothing much you can do with the prices or regulations. If you got the time, then wait but that is a gamble loh. What if prices continue to go up? 
 

If a 5 room is too ex, go for 4 room. Then choose suburb locations. Don't have to always be mature estate mah. The key is get the biggest flat which you can afford. If you're happy with it, then stay for life. If not, upgrade and sell it  away after MOP.  U don't have to die die make the HDB your first and last home right? 
 

I grew up with my grandma, parents and 2 siblings in a 3 room flat. 
 

Grandma and elder sis sleep in 1 room. Younger bro and my parents in the masterbed room. I sleep in the living room. Then we upgraded to a bigger flat when my dad earned more.

I do understand where you guys are coming from. If we practice what have been suggested here, then how life have been change as compared to during our parents time? Like no difference leh. Seems like it will always be like this where living room is meant to be a "bedroom" after certain timing.
 

Like this we call ourselves 1st world. I mean, we are not really at the extreme low income group, while we are not the highest earner, but we are decent enough to buy a half a mil flat and has got no intention to sell or move. After all it is a roof over our head and this roof is the only place where we spend must of our time in it.
 

Most of us been thru squeezing in 2-3 rooms flats in the early 80s. So r we going to remain like this for generations? Next time our kids dun even know if they can afford their own flat, most prob is staying with us, then the same 3 generation will squeeze again. I never forget how my brother have to study in the kitchen while we sleep in the hall. So to make things better, last time our parents no $$ to install Aircon in the hall. Now we can. So this is consider a better life. Hahahah.

HDB will also introduce a new type of Three-Generation (3Gen) flat to cater to multi-generation families living under one roof. These flats will feature four-bedrooms and three-bathrooms (two en-suites), with an internal floor area of about 115 sqm.
 

WTF ?? 3 generations, 4 bedrooms, 3 toilets --> only 115sqm ?????? 
 

KNN, HDB think Singaporeans are midgets ah ?

This 'correct' way will lead to many casualties, which creates social problems. Engineering it thru politics is another way to adjusting pricing without casualties, imo

Considering that people who earned 3.2k and below belong to the bottom 20% in Spore. A 7-8 k household income belongs to the lower middle class so you should be able only to afford a 3 room flat comfortably, more or less.
 

We must be more realistic with our expectations.

i think can afford bigger flat....
 

based on above, it is quite obvious the difference between parents time and now is priorities has changed... last time is 1 house 1 car or no car... now is 1 house at least 1 car or 2 cars..... see the difference?

The income limit will now be $6,500, a sharp increase from the previous $2,250. This will give a financial boost of up to $20,000 for those who choose four-room flats in non-mature estates.

There were 51,000 Housing Board flats fully owned by permanent residents as of end June, representing 6 per cent of all HDB flats, said Mr Khaw in a written parliamentary reply this month.
 

This year, 130 flats were sold by PRs within three years of their purchase, while 320 were sold within four years of purchase, and 490 within five years.

I do understand where you guys are coming from. If we practice what have been suggested here, then how life have been change as compared to during our parents time? Like no difference leh. Seems like it will always be like this where living room is meant to be a "bedroom" after certain timing.
 

Like this we call ourselves 1st world. I mean, we are not really at the extreme low income group, while we are not the highest earner, but we are decent enough to buy a half a mil flat and has got no intention to sell or move. After all it is a roof over our head and this roof is the only place where we spend must of our time in it.
 

Most of us been thru squeezing in 2-3 rooms flats in the early 80s. So r we going to remain like this for generations? Next time our kids dun even know if they can afford their own flat, most prob is staying with us, then the same 3 generation will squeeze again. I never forget how my brother have to study in the kitchen while we sleep in the hall. So to make things better, last time our parents no $$ to install Aircon in the hall. Now we can. So this is consider a better life. Hahahah.
 

Hai............ a 1st world country, that promised a roof over everybody's head, but yet everyone have to squeeze.
 

Like tat we long long ago already 1st world lor



 
 

To me that's very shallow to say that by having bigger flats mean we are better off than before. Let me share, I stay in a 5-room with father, wife and 2 kids. So my 2 kids stay in the same room, my wife stay in 1 room and father another room. BUT the point is my 2 kids, 6 and 3, rather squeeze with us than to sleep in their own room and they played in their room or the living room.
 

We must really think more than material gains but also moral gains and self satisfaction. I'm happy with what I have, I earn / yearn more to satisfy my greed.

"Changes to existing housing grants will cost the Government S$440 million a year, up from the current S$290 million that is currently given in grants such as the Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) and Special CPF Housing Grant (SHG)."
 

how is this new housing grant a cost when they set the sale prices? isnt this just an accounting treatment???



 

Figures only, so looks scary to us and GOOD EXCUSE to increase GST

why were we came to this debate if you and your wife can afford a bigger flat, a 4 room flat cost $300K is still within the mean right?
 




Nothing wrong with Ti lam. But Y 70s ppl no car now we must have? Y 70s bedroon no aircon now must have. Y 70s no hp now must have.
 

We have to be honest that as a human, we do progress as time goes by, but now it seems like on the surface we are, but once u enter your HBD house door, you are back to 70s-80s. hahaha
 

My concern is a proper study room for my kids. Studying in bedroom is not healthy, not to mentioned studying in the hall or kitchen. Kids study, my parents cannot watch TV. Bedroom will end up like me Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.......
 

I mean just want to provide a better environment for my kids. I don't even think of giving them to have their own room, they have to share room leh but is the room big enough to have a double deckle bed, a wardrobe and a study table? Wardrobe is meant for 2 kids/teenagers/young adult. Want us to buy a flat within our means can, but at least give us the space that we need mah. Correct?

Considering that people who earned 3.2k and below belong to the bottom 20% in Spore. A 7-8 k household income belongs to the lower middle class so you should be able only to afford a 3 room flat comfortably, more or less.
 

We must be more realistic with our expectations.



 
 

you don't know what you are talking. 3.2k is around median income of Singapore resident (SC+PR). So, ~half of the population earn less than that amount.

In the book "Freakonomics", it mentioned a project "Early Childhood Longitudinal Study" where they identified 8 factors that are strongly correlated to test scores.

One of them is "The child has many books in his home".
 

Although there are ebooks, ereaders/tablets providing a multimedia or interactive experience, online reference, quick contextual searches, I do think a physical book collection still the better medium in maintaining focus, building a passion or laying a solid foundation in a quest for knowledge to the academic inclined.

It's the motivational issue with your kids, on whether they wan to study or not.  A friend of mine, family v poor. got no space at home to study.  He study at the HDB staircase landing every single day. That staircase was his study room.  He would sweep the staircase very clean before putting his books there every single day. And he scored As.  Another friend, family also v poor.  She slept and study in the living room until JC.  and she also scored As all the way from Dunman High to Haw Chong JC.

actually jumbo also got problem one

especially the 200sqm one

that one has many pillars here and there and cannot knock down

so you end up with a house with maybe 7 room but each room not so big

not shiok 
 

the 167sqm version better

the hall very big 

less pillars also 

but as a whole smaller 

though you see already is more shiok

actually jumbo also got problem one

especially the 200sqm one

that one has many pillars here and there and cannot knock down

so you end up with a house with maybe 7 room but each room not so big

not shiok 
 

the 167sqm version better

the hall very big 

less pillars also 

but as a whole smaller 

though you see already is more shiok  



 

Yeah been to my friend's jumbo at marsiling near the American school. Big but too segmented because of all the walls that can't be broken down. The living room same size as normal 4-room, just that there's another "wing" of the house with more rooms and wash area etc.
 

My parents stay in the ~1800sqft jumbo/executive at the older side of marsiling, much more spacious because the living/dining area is big. Master bedroom fookin big, can partition into 2 to make sleeping/wardrobe area and sitting/tv/dresser area. Total 3 bedrooms and 1 "study room" but only two toilets (one attached to master bedroom). It looks designed as a large unit vs the 4+3 jumbo which is obviously two units combined into 1.

Ya loh, even my previous flat which was an EA was already at 125 sqm was just nice only. Not very big even though it had 3 rooms + 1 small study room. In fact, we hack away the walls of the study room to make the hall bigger.
 

The new MGF at 115 comes with 3 toilets! Wonder where are they gonna squeeze that in?



 

very good.. HDB must have hired architects of the mickey mouse units we see these days.. 115sqm with 3 toilets and 4 bedrooms

In Singapore ,be careful of what u wished for. Kpkb so now hdb resale prices will drop and hbd dwellers will have lesser cash proceeds when they sell. For those who, wanna upgrade to condo , sorry is gonna be tougher now.
 

For now , Pr will be forced to buy mass market condo (unless they prefer to rent) hence the prices should remain stable or inch upwards. 
 

Middle class screwed again . Haha. 
 

Same for Coe , Kpkb , did car prices drop ? Will it drop ?   Not yet perhaps  or may shoot up. Who knows ? All I know is , every year there are 30k new PRs . 10%of these rich enough to fill up quota for cars liao.

HDB will also introduce a new type of Three-Generation (3Gen) flat to cater to multi-generation families living under one roof. These flats will feature four-bedrooms and three-bathrooms (two en-suites), with an internal floor area of about 115 sqm.
 

WTF ?? 3 generations, 4 bedrooms, 3 toilets --> only 115sqm ?????? 
 

KNN, HDB think Singaporeans are midgets ah ?

HDB policy thread become tiko thread..  
 




hold for 10 years that sell like normal Private condo loh.  bo bian. 



 

I think EC buyers kena pawn liao lah.. 

EC target 2nd timer/ more establish buyer, which is ard 30-40 yrs old. 

When they buy the EC , they need to wait 4 -yrs to build , 5 yrs to sell to locals , 5 yrs to sell as pte.

Good 14 yrs later.. by that time they are already 44 - 54  yrs old liao. 
 

Unlikily for them for sell and ,eventually , upgrade liao because

1) their loan tenure will be less than 15 yrs liao

2) over the period 9 yrs, they are barred from selling their property in sg. Or even rent out their place. 

3) over the period 9 yrs, they are barred from buying their property in sg. Cannot use parent's name liao

....also not sure if they will be able to sell their current flat and the EC in the future at a property upcycle.

basically, they sold their opportunity to ride on pty cycle for that 200-300k gain, which may due to inflation erodes. 

Imagine, if they rent out their hdb.. 1 mth - 2k  for 9 yrs = already 200k over 
 
 

If 2nd timer didn't buy EC, they would be better off keeping their hdb.

1) they could buy a 2nd pte when they accumulate enough cash, esp in a down cycle

2) Rent out their hdb for high rental yield. The stored value in the current flat would  be able to ride them through any down cycle.

EC should be for own stay ... the noble cause of EC is to help people to fulfill their dream to live in gated flat with swimming pool and clubhouse but don't want to pay market price

i reckon up EC MOP up to 10 years ... next CM !
 

Level 1 = HDB = MOP 5 years

Level 2 = EC = MPO 10 years (at least 7-8 years)

No choice, who ask you not to be rich. In sg if you are middle class, you always would be the one who suffer most. Dont think car price will come down much even there are many old cars scrap from 2015, dont think gvot will be so good to repeat their 'mistake' again.

No choice, who ask you not to be rich. In sg if you are middle class, you always would be the one who suffer most. Dont think car price will come down much even there are many old cars scrap from 2015, dont think gvot will be so good to repeat their 'mistake' again.

IMHO..

1) by 2016, the hdb prices may have corrected, say 10%. Sell also cheaper than now.
 

2) by 2016, alot of condo bto TOP already. The demand may not as intensitive as now. Sales of resale flat will remain flat in 2016 as new PR is not a big consumer of re-sale flats and some may have already turn to lower-end pte.
 

3) Just as this CM is introduced out of the blue. by 2016, you cannot gurantee that there will be further restriction on sales/use of hdb. If they siao siao, say buyer of resale flat cannot rent out for 10 yrs starting for 2015.. the demand/price may drop even further than now. 
 

4) Those that bought units top by 2016, are paying a much higher prices than those TOP now. Even though, it may be harder for EC(TOP 2014) to sell now. They enjoys a higher price ==> bigger profit. And already captial appreciation on their EC. 
 

5) Interest rate correction more visible by 2016.
 
 

The way i see, HDB cannot touch which was at the back of my mind in 2011 when i sold my hdb. If have enuff $$ buy pte at a reasonable price. HDB will be subjected to stew policy because gov has to applease SC. And with SC youngster hoping to be spoon-fed.. I believe the CM against HDB will not stop here... Likely, we will see MOP extended etc. 
 

Also not forgetting, those that bought EC(TOP 2016) have given up their chance to rent out their current flat now because they are barred from buying pte. The opportunity cost is way to huge..

But really when i look back, i wish i had bought a HDB flat years ago. It is a good place to stay in for retirement.

One thing for sure, the price of HDB flats will be stable (i.e. will not crash) since reducing the value would mean reducing the net assets of most Singaporeans. 

If they do too much to limit hdb rental, they are also going to affect a huge group of PMETs who do not earn enough to rent private. This will in turn affect business costs and make Singapore a less conducive place to do business. 

Investment wise...I would not have sold away my hdb if I had one. Even if I can't rent out the hdb unit, opportunity cost is lower and there is no management fees monthly. However, for private condos, if it is vacant, i still have to pay for the management fees and the higher property tax.

Cant agree more..

For me, i moved because of my children. And not willing to pay >100k COV for a 20+ yr flat near my targetted school.  If then , the MOP is still 1 yr for HDB, sure will pick up another one near the parents.Cos' if i buy hdb will be locked in for 5 yrs.. by that time.. my children already pass the Pri 1 registeration liao.

HDB looks like it going to drop not only in COV but in prices (when -cov) appears.. Because there is less demand in the mkt. Actually , I fear that the recent news will cause all the EC buyer (TOP 2014 , TOP 2015, TOP 2016) to panick and start to sell now. And rent while waiting for their EC to top. 
 

EC upgraders will be force to sell, the later you sell... the price would have dropped further.. So (TOP 2016 EC upgraders) may not be better off than EC upgrader that is forced to sell in the coming mths. 
 

Btw now to 2016... it's looks gloomy if you are trying to sell hdb lor.. whether or not there will massive sell-off for hdb.. seriously that one i cannot predict lor.
 

the 2015 batch.. will depends on their buying price lor, not sure if there is a great appreciation till date.. ... and how much is their hdb worth by 2015.. i cannot predict also.. but i believe could be lower than now.
 

This is just my opinion.. please read it and evaluate accordingly.

But sell now then got to rent a place to stay for 2-3 years. The rental paid may not be lesser than the COV earned now, then in the end nothing gain/loss...isn't it more not worth it?

depends on how much the price drop.The future i cannot predict so i dun want to take the risk that price drop until more than 50k. 

$$ at hand is better  .. afterall, your buy price for your EC already fixed liao. :)

also if you rent it's a fixed cost for the next 2 yrs ( 2yr contact) . I will feel more "an xin" lor. :)
 

And it not trure that nothing gain... if you sell later.. you may end up not getting any cash back from your sales.
 

Cos' prices is determined by COV trend. No COV does not mean no gain, just not higher than last qtr ave selling price. Those that has been reading abt HDB and intend to buy/sell would know what i mean.

i think these bros are okay lah..

1) they got cash from selling their house because last time they buy very cheap only

2) their EC already appreciate on valuation for at least 10-20% since they bought.

3) they just need to wait 10 yrs before selling at condo price.
 

I think they are winners :) Prive is a nice condo i muz say also. Just maybe could have made more if PM and KBH havent announce such drastic measure that skew the mkt demand.

what talking you.. they sell their current hdb at price much more than their buy price.

They are making $$ and see the cash. But maybe not as much as what you consider huat.

maybe maybe not.. depends how much they earn from their current flat lor and their buy price for their EC. 
 

E.g. they bought their central flat at 200k,fully paid, sell now at 800k ( reference redhill hdb) 

Bought EC at 700k ... upgrade and can see $$ lor :P

Also the same EC bought 4 yrs ago , now appreciate 20% ... so we are looking at the EC worth >840k.  maybe not alot lah. :P

those with no intention to sell now.. it will be good to do a valuation of the house.. just in case a good offer come by. :) Like neighbour's children want to buy over etc.



 

rental is not cheap. a small 3 room flat in ulu place will cost you at least 2K per month. Let say that your EC will be ready in 3 years time. You need to pay 70K as rental. I wonder   that how much can you gain by going thru all these hassles.

U r rite in a way

Different pple diff perspective

All diff scenario

I understand where u coming from

For me same , if got 600, I sell 580 ok Liao

If by 2015, drop 50, I dun mind take it as rental lost

If 100 k drop I oso ok lar

Fig nia

Not real cash on hand see see feel feel

Drop 200, I still smile smile mOve bigger pigeon hole lor

Wat to do  



 

yup.. everyone are in different situation.. And buy and sell their house for different reasons. And hopefully not purely because of profit because you can never tell what will happen next. :P Can never time the mkt. 
 

Like some others, I also hope that gov allow pte owner to buy resale.. if that happens.. then EC upgrader no need to scare no buyers :P

all these are random thoughts lah..
 

maybe , just maybe the government is preparing us for the "wave" of FT ? I mean how long can the current manpower shortage situation continue. The hotel/restaurant/construction are suffering now.. And the quality of the hired is not up to expectation, which in turn is affecting the image of the country.
 

So maybe my "analysis" is all wrong in the first place :P

Cfm now here, alot will shoot me Liao la

Because they are not in the situation

first of all you own a bigger flat in VERY matured area to fetch that kind of price, then you have to settle for a EC of small size that is 30km away.
 

the money made to buy a car which easily cost $120K? and the time spent on travelling?
 
 




maybe maybe not.. depends how much they earn from their current flat lor and their buy price for their EC. 
 

E.g. they bought their central flat at 200k,fully paid, sell now at 800k ( reference redhill hdb) 

Bought EC at 700k ... upgrade and can see $$ lor :P

Also the same EC bought 4 yrs ago , now appreciate 20% ... so we are looking at the EC worth >840k.  maybe not alot lah. :P
 

but i guess this is peanut to some ppl here lor.

do HDB still require minimum 20% cash/cpf downpayment now huh?

20% x $502K = $100K
 

assuming obtain PR last year, cpf probably minimum/kosong, pay $100K cash?

IT CSO can afford a $502K HDB?

using a loan calculator 2% interest for $400K loan with 25 years tenure ... monthly repayment is about $1,700 

is indeed much cheaper than renting a flat ... if possible let 2 rooms out ($500 x 2) then ... ho say liao 
 

44 years old william must be very sad ... sell $502K and downgrade to 3-room flat to cash out ... now stuck liao. but got hope for relax case-by-case

may be 60 days grace period like used car

Cannot look down at PRC one. Some of them are benefited from the crazy property boom in China, especially those from Beijing and Shanghai. I know one PRC guy, who saw the price of his Beijing house rose ten fold in the past 10 years.According to him, the price of his house is ~SGD 1 million now.

Tmr what happen i cannot predict but i think i am okay now. :) whether or not my roof will appreciate.. i also dun really care. Children next time can buy hdb or not.. i also leave it to them. Just like my parents, i provide them an environment to achieve ( no studyroom though)... what they eventurally achieve is up to them.. the sky is their limit.. 
 

Now only worry make not enough $$ to bring the whole family oversea.. WTF .. 1 family trip is like 2 mths salary.    but then again, i think its more impt than buying a rolex watch for myself.. cos' hope the children grow up with their grandparents. And grandparents get to enjoy life abit.

no need, unless you start defaulting..

Bank also dun want to make everyone bankrupt.. like that laki cannot collect $$.
 

If you pay your instalment promptly, they will leave you alone. But if you miss payment a few wk, they will start to re-value your loan etc.. cos' they dun want you to be the 1st one to "dry" you out, claim your asset and what is left.

Actually, if i have already bought a EC now .. and holding my hdb.. i would try to start selling liao because the price now shld be better than later when my EC TOP.
 
 

those with no intention to sell now.. it will be good to do a valuation of the house.. just in case a good offer come by. :) Like neighbour's children want to buy over etc.



 
 

I still dun understand why ppl are allowed to hang on to their HDB while they buy EC or pte.

hmm.. i just tot of a solution for brothers that are getting their EC / BTO.. not to have to force sell at cheap price. 

Gift it to your parents or children lor. ;) then you get to keep the flat.. and rent out later.

small thing. i think cannot hold on to hdb if buy ec, but buy pte can. as ec is still hdb when buy new.
 

but agree fully. want to buy pte, must let go hdb.

hdb is asset enhancement

hdb is money making tool 

hdb is your ticket to retirement
 

it's the locomotive that pull the property train engine. you shut the engine, many will be jialat you know
 

now with a waiting time of 3 years for new PR to buy resale, it is more reason for sporean to keep their hdb for rental while shaking leg in private condo

BTO i got 2, both at first try at the location i wanted 

first is when n where im young and drinking at kopishop

I targetted this plot of land in front of kopi shop, i got it

Now i getting old, need a quieter place with less traffic

Thus i got this 2nd plot
 

Lucky, God is fair 




I'm not sure your first ballot is where, but your second ballot that location could be less popular, so you got a good queue #.

Anyway, you are lucky. Congrads to you!
 

I know of many friends, also 2nd timer, very hard to get the flat they want, and subsequently gave up. Me included.

Sometimes I wonder what are the perks of getting PR now. No priority for their children in P1 registration, cannot buy BTO, cannot buy resale HDB for first 3 yrs. They are basically screwed.




Not really, they still have some benefits enjoyed as PR, which are same as SC.... 
 

Best of all, they came here for good $$$, and good social security.

If go Punggol Plaza, usually I eat the food court's Jap/Korean stall or fish soup stall, cos family members liked it. Hardly try the zi char there.... 
 

I know the Prime supermarket food court food not nice, so skip that place altogether with the zi char as well...

303 a few years ago tried there before. The zi char is not bad also. Didn't know their crystal hor fun is special dish. But overall find that kopitiam rather cramp and smokey (ventilation not good lor). Alright will KIV and try it when got chance!

Unfortunately it is also more expensive comparing to the 2 ECs in woodlands. 

I would say the developer really earn a lot from this project considering the low land price they bought from the government. Still the take up rate is very good, all the choice units were snapped up on the day of launch.

Flat sellers grow desperate and slash COV to zero
 


Following the major changes introduced by the Government last Tuesday in a bid to stabilise the property market here, sellers are reducing their asking cash over valuation (COV). 

Some sellers are panicking, five property agents said.
 

Agents specialising in HDB flats said they have seen COVs plummet by up to $60,000 over the past few months and they expect the numbers to dip some more.
 

Property agent Raymond Eu said some sellers are so desperate for "whatever they can get" that they are even agreeing to sell their flats at zero COV.
 

Read the full report in The New Paper on Sept 2 (Monday).

More HDB resale flats being sold with zero COV
 


SINGAPORE: More people are selling their Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats in the resale market without a cash premium. 
 

The Singapore Real Estate Exchange (SRX) said transactions involving zero Cash-Over-Valuation (COV) have more than tripled, from 14 in January to 49 in July.
 
 

The overall median COV dipped to a low of S$20,000 in July, the lowest since 2011.
 
 

SRX now said it is seeing more people selling their flats even below that level - without any cash premium.
 
 

Zero-COV transactions made up 1 per cent of all HDB resale transactions in January.
 
 

This went up to 3.9 per cent in July, and 5.7 per cent in August so far.
 
 

There have been 32 zero-COV transactions recorded by SRX in August so far.
 
 

On a yearly basis, zero-COV transactions made up 1.7 per cent of all HDB resale transactions in 2011, compared to 1.9 per cent in 2012.
 

From January till now, zero-COV transactions made up 2.1 per cent of all HDB transactions.
 

Christine Li, head of research and consultancy at OrangeTee, said: "Previously, I think it took about four to six weeks to close the deal. But now, it is taking longer. Some can be as long as four months.
 
 

"A lot of sellers are still asking for high COVs, but the buyer pool is shrinking because of the January cooling measures as well as the ramp up in BTO (Build-to-Order) supply.
 
 

"The seller actually has to compete with the BTOs to offer buyers the same kind of deals they can look for in the market."
 
 

According to SRX data, from the beginning of the year till July, 164 zero-COV transactions were recorded
 
 

The top five towns that have seen the most zero-COV transactions are Jurong West, Hougang,  Woodlands  , Punggol and Sengkang. 
 
 

These are places where new BTO projects were launched by the HDB in the past year.
 
 

Property analysts have said that even though HDB resale flats are being sold with zero cash premium at valuation level, property sellers are still likely to make a profit from their transaction.
 
 

Nicholas Mak, executive director for research and consultancy at SLP International Property Consultants, said: "If they were to have bought their flats brand new from the government, they would have bought it at a price that is below the current market price. Or even if they were to buy it as resale flats five years ago, during the financial crisis, chances are they would have bought it at a price that is cheaper than today."
 
 

With more residential units being completed this year, analysts said more sellers can be expected in the HDB resale market.
 
 

So more zero-COV transactions can be expected, and even some negative-COV transactions as well.

I think they squeeze their balls until bak chor balls liao.  
 

Oh well, they will console themselves and reason out and say, but the selling price also increased by quite a lot. So, no big loss.

Are HDB resale prices headed for a correction?
 


In light of the new rules announced on Tuesday by the Housing and Development Board, some market watchers are once again suggesting that it would not be long before HDB resale prices start to correct, beginning with the larger flats. 

Permanent residents will now have to wait three years after receiving their PR status to buy a resale HDB flat, softening demand from this group of buyers, who presently account for about a fifth of all resale transactions. 
 

The HDB also shortened its maximum loan tenure to 25 years from 30 years and cut the mortgage servicing ratio cap to 30 per cent from 35 per cent of the borrower

Zero cov for some area? Sure? If yes i go and buy one. 
 

If resale flat now is zero cov, dont think many people will buy BTO flat cause BTO needs to wait so long to get the flat.

the ruling let the buyer to buy within their mean (for new flat), their mean is not in the matured area  
 

the number of unit in matured area are limited and there are buyers who will still pay for the convenience.

well, it's "shared" amongst so many people and hence the "impact" if any will be minimal. Whereas for haunted unit, you shoulder it yourself. Just guessing.
 

Also, the cemetery is a dedicated place for dead to rest in peace and probably the spirits are normalized liao without the hatred. Whereas, for a haunted unit, the spirit might be angry and refused to go away.

Dead bodies buried on the ground is different from the deceased died on the spot, esp if the person died of unnatural death like murder or suicide. People would feel weird if someone have died at a particular spot.

Hostel black market: NUS, NTU students renting out their rooms

The New Paper

Wednesday, Sep 04, 2013
 

She is a first-year National University of Singapore (NUS) undergraduate on a scholarship. And she is profiting from her sponsored $400-a-month on-campus hostel room at Prince George's Park by renting it out.
 

Budding entrepreneur or blatant profiteer? She is just one of many who are taking advantage of the campus "property crunch" in Singapore.
 

In July, the business student had advertised the availability of her residence for rent. This was done on HardwareZone online forums. Like many undergrads, she knows about the huge demand for hostel places.
 

Wanting to be known by her user name, Locoy242, she admitted that she doesn't need her hostel room as she lives nearby in Clementi.
 

The 21-year-old said: "This way, I have more pocket money to spend."
 

Three weeks ago, she received a call from someone who offered her $400 a month.
 

She told The New Paper she knew of several friends who also sublet their NUS halls and residences to others who need it more.
 

What she is doing is against university rules. But demand is so hot for hostel rooms that students often outbid each other to rent hostel rooms at their universities, with some willing to pay several hundred dollars a month to get the room of their choice.
 

Students say they know they risk eviction and fines. But they do it anyway because the universities do not bother monitoring such transactions.

aiya.. what is illegal and what is legal ? all depends on how the law defines it.The world is so big.. what is right and what is wrong actually diff from places to places.. 

We grew up in a environment where right and wrong are fully spelled out.. So we get upset over some things as such. The root of the problem is that why NUS/NTU does not make checks on the student hostel to ensure ? I tot there are teachers staying in every hall ?
 
 

Sell lemonard in your frontyard is illegal here.. but legal oversea.

Rent out your studio to tourist for short term stay is illegal here.. but legal oversea.
 

That;s why sg go outside kena left right centre by the taiwanese , chinese. The rule/law can only protect you so much.. You mux be smart to make $$.

Hi guys,

Every year 30k PR status granted out to FT...

Would this 0 COV simply be a knee jerk reaction? Or would it be another step toward a significant drop in hdb resale value?

How abt prices in eg 3 yrs from now, shoot high?

Interested to know wats your take on this...  



 

Before the announcement, the mkt is already moderating due to lower loan ratio as well as higher subsidies and a much higher asking price. Already hdb is sold 5-10% higher than last year, so the 0 COV just means that the prices as stablised. 
 

I believe that 3yr restriction does not has much effect as much effect on the resale mkt as the other 2.
 

Whether or not prices supply has caught up with demand, will depend on the next 3 mths. Likely HDB will fall to a more reasonable level. i.e. 700psm for mature/central area and 500psm for ORC areas. And demand for resale flat will be lesser. 

Already a few of my single friends are talking abt holding back their purchase and wait for the price to go down before they enter the mkt.

Here it is  
 

[sINGAPORE] The Monetary Authority of Singapore says it will keep an eye on "credit practices of FIs (financial institutions) and data trends", and assess if last week's tenure reduction for bank loans for HDB flats should be extended to private home loans.
 

On Aug 27, MAS trimmed the maximum tenure of new home loans for the purchase of HDB flats and refinancing of such facilities granted by FIs, from 35 years to 30 years.
 

At the same time, tighter loan-to-value (LTV) limits which previously applied to new loans with tenures exceeding 30 years now apply to loans of more than 25 years.
 

When asked if MAS plans to extend these to private housing mortgages, its spokesman said that it will "continue to monitor the credit practices of FIs and data trends, and assess if tenure reduction should be extended to loans for the purchase of private properties".
 

Market watchers reckon a key data trend MAS would be tracking is whether loan tenures for private homes have been creeping up towards the maximum 35 years allowed currently. Such a trend would raise the impetus for MAS to extend the loan tenure cut to the private housing sector.
 

However, BT understands the reverse situation has surfaced as borrowers would rather seek shorter-tenure loans than suffer a significantly lower LTV limit - by 20 percentage points - for new private home loans exceeding 30 years or where the loan period extends beyond the borrower's retirement age of 65 years.
 

A banking industry source estimates that the January property cooling measures led to a 20-30 per cent drop in the number of private home loans approved by banks between the first and second quarters of this year. "The introduction of the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) in late-June has led to a further decline.
 

"We've also noticed that developers have been launching new private residential projects at prices lower than what they had earlier aimed for, before TDSR was announced. So you may say that the cooling measures/TDSR have been effective," added the source.
 

Ong Choon Fah, chief operating officer, South-east Asia, at property consulting group DTZ, notes that property market activity has "already dropped a lot since TDSR was implemented".
 

"And with the ongoing flow of funds out of the region, markets such as equities and currencies are very volatile. The authorities will want to ensure that we are robust enough to ride through this. They'll watch very carefully before implementing any further measures affecting the property market," she added.
 

On Aug 27, the government announced that new loans granted by FIs for the purchase of HDB flats with tenures exceeding 25 years or where the loan period extends beyond the borrower's 65-year retirement age are subject to tighter LTV limits.
 

Where a borrower has no outstanding housing loan, the applicable LTV limit will be 60 per cent, instead of 80 per cent.
 

Where the borrower has one outstanding housing loan, the LTV limit will be 30 per cent, instead of 50 per cent. And if the borrower has two or more outstanding housing loans, the LTV limit will be 20 per cent, instead of 40 per cent.
 

At present, these tighter LTV limits also apply to new loans for the purchase of private homes but only where the loan tenure exceeds 30 years or stretches past the borrower's retirement age. Currently the maximum tenure allowed for private home loans (both new loans and refinancing cases) is 35 years.
 

BT understands that private home buyers have been seeking shorter-tenure loans since last October, when the authorities introduced the 35-year maximum loan tenure for all residential property loans and lowered the LTV ratio on new housing loans if their tenure exceeds 30 years or the loan period stretches past the borrower's 65-year retirement age.
 

"Anecdotally, customers are maximising LTV instead of maximising tenure. A borrower that does not have any outstanding home mortgage qualifies for up to 80 per cent LTV for a private home purchase if the loan tenure is up to 30 years, but a lower 60 per cent LTV for a loan of more than 30 years. To a borrower, this 20-point difference in LTV is more significant than being able to enjoy additional years in the duration of the private home loan," noted a financial industry player.
 

The trend of borrowers preferring shorter loan tenures for private home purchases is said to have gained momentum following the January cooling package, which further tightened LTV limits on individual borrowers with at least one outstanding home loan. At the same time, the minimum cash downpayment for this group was raised from 10 per cent to 25 per cent.
