A fren of mine just bought a 40 yo flats for close to $500k.
 

Taking into consideration that all flat are 99 yr lease.
 

She is now close to 50yr old.
 

Let says that if she will to sell her flat in 20 yrs time, her unit will be 60 yrs

 old, with the lease remaining for 39 yrs.
 

How much do you think that her flat will fetch?
 

600K or less than 400K??

It just means that that it is harder to get bank to loan to such purchase, doesn't necessarily mean the price will be affected. If the location is damn solid, it will still have value....

At which age of a hdb flat will its value plateau and then depreciate?  It beats me hdb properties do not seem to depreciate unlike private ones.
 

Propped up by hdb and see who catches the baby?

So far I don't think the situation has ever arisen where flats have not been enbloced. 
 

From memory, there is an age at which getting the mortgage is difficult though (maybe less than 40 years left?) 
 

You would need to look into HDB carefully - cause I think there's also a mechanism to top up the lease right?

It depends on whether LHL is still around in 20years time, and still holding on to power.

I reserved my opinion that Singapore's future stability really depends on the LHL's staying in power.

Already got 2 with structural columns failure. Our concern should be, how long can the rest be safe for 99 years?

Especially now that we got this Marina Barrage. The underground tunneling on-going. How will the sustained higher ground water table with vibrations affect the foundations? How will any affected foundations support the flats above? Most of us ignore them like fools. A fool and his money soon part company (our lives as well).

Actually depends on the time when she sell the flat, so it hard to say. However, if the flat is at a good location. There is high chance that she can fetch good rental as compare to her purchase price. and given that she is 50yrs old.. serious, does she want to move in 20 yrs.. at 70yrs ?

Hard to say cos maybe when she turns 70 and find that flat is too
 

big for her or she is not in good health and need money for medical expenses.
 

The 2 things that will benefit her are :
 

1) Enbloc
 

2) HDB decide to extend the 99 lease for all flats

if 3 rm.. i think quite sure will enbloc.. but if bigger flat.. i doubt so.. so far they have not enbloc anything bigger than 3rm flat. got a feeling that the gov will just let it expires and take back the land.

The other problem is people who spent a lot on renovation.
 

I heard one lady spent $300,000 and her unit enblock.
 

She cannot take her very expensive shiny flooring with seashells

600K or less than 400K??



 

We cannot predict something that is unpredictable. Maybe some ppl hope 20 years later with different govt all HDB flats become free.

The important thing is if she feels comfortable with her "new" flat. Take a simple example: if her flat is near her work place within walking distance, she saves 2 hours on travling time compared to her old house. That means, she saved:

TIME: 

2hrs x 26 days x 12 months x 15yrs = 9,360 hours divide 24hrs = 390days.

TRANSPORT EXPENSES:

$5 X 26 days x 12 months x 15yrs = $23,400

True, if your flat will enbloc eventually, and if you spent too much on your renovation, it is really wasted as you cannot take away them.

Technically, that's what HDB is supposed to be doing, let the lease expire and take back the land, and the unit owner gets nothing. However, with the en-bloc mentality where HDB takes back an aging flat and gives a replacement with some top-ups, it just gives people the false sense of security that their flats will never lose value, causing people to keep pushing up the prices of flats, as long as demand is there.
 

But, when the precedence is set where HDB takes back a 99-year flat without paying the owner, all hell breaks loose.

1. Owners will be punching above their own weights.

2. The spurs will dig in deep into the owners' hides.

3. Owners will stop being complacent.

4. When they lose so much money, their wife and daughters will end up as maids in other countries.

Actually it boils down to your needs IMO. 
 
For me, if I'm happy with the location n space is adequate, I'll stay put n anyway likely value will go up since got new mrt at your door step n if lucky can get enbloc later who knows??
Private I feel prices not hit rock bottom yet so no hurry I feel unless u really found something u like and price is reasonable. These days, HDB is like a goldmine so hold on where possible. 
Just my 2 cents, good luck on your decision making!!

For me I would keep my HDB as my retirement home. The monthly costs to keep and live in HDB is really low if you don't drive.
 
If you move to a private property, it may be ok to pay $300 a month for the maintenance (of 5I comparable size) for now since you are still working, imagine $300 (and most likely more) a month when you retired is a lot of money to feed the house. Not forgetting sinking fund, interim repairs, etc, etc. If you are in high income category then above comment not relevant lah.

Dun assume enbloc is always there. Looking at the big picture, it depends on SG as whole. think Khaw mentioned before that not all will be enbloc b4.
 
 If enbloc, what happen next? The same site will be tear down and a new HDB, much higher with smaller units and more expensive will take the place. This is only possible if the SG population (in other words, new immigrant) is going up since someone got to buy the new place since only SG are eligible. This is possible if SG remains positively attractive and has ample employment opportunities. Gov does that because it is profitable and provides a scheme to renew old flats and enable more SG to take up loans (so that they continue to work hard to service their loan) and CPF can be "retained" as they are wiped out to pay for the flat.

Let says that if she will to sell her flat in 20 yrs time, her unit will be 60 yrs
old, with the lease remaining for 39 yrs.
 
How much do you think that her flat will fetch?
 
600K or less than 400K??

 
I hope she didn't buy it.
 
This is very bad planning.
 
When she is 110 she will homeless.

Actually it boils down to your needs IMO. 
 
For me, if I'm happy with the location n space is adequate, I'll stay put n anyway likely value will go up since got new mrt at your door step n if lucky can get enbloc later who knows??
Private I feel prices not hit rock bottom yet so no hurry I feel unless u really found something u like and price is reasonable. These days, HDB is like a goldmine so hold on where possible. 
Just my 2 cents, good luck on your decision making!!

Tks Bro, yeah I very happy w current place n I admit I don't quite like MRT coming up cos many trees were sacrificed n I rather take bus than MRT.
 
I did check out freehold condo around my area but the prices r tad too high n the tax I hv to "white white give" if I still want to keep my HDB just don't makes $ sense.
 
Guess I will stay put till Enbloc.

I am currently staying put in a 5I, lease starts in 1978.
 
Even with seller, buyer, LUP costs thrown in, the price I paid is still under valuation.
 
Nearest got 2 MRT stations (NS line) with another line coming up and entrance/exit is just below my block.
 
Surrounded by reputable neighbour sch and price for my block didn't drop much.
 
Dono whether I shd:-
1) Enbloc
2) Wait for MRT to be completed
3) Get EC
4) Get condo
 
Appreciate n TIA for any inputs.
 
Btw, I love my area here cos it can gets u almost anywhere by public or pte tpt even with MRT breakdown cos bus svc here is good.

 
You must be minister Khaw. That's why you can decide whether to enbloc or not.

For me I would keep my HDB as my retirement home. The monthly costs to keep and live in HDB is really low if you don't drive.
 
If you move to a private property, it may be ok to pay $300 a month for the maintenance (of 5I comparable size) for now since you are still working, imagine $300 (and most likely more) a month when you retired is a lot of money to feed the house. Not forgetting sinking fund, interim repairs, etc, etc. If you are in high income category then above comment not relevant lah.

Tks true maintenance funds can be alot if not working.

Yadah I wished. Then I won't be posing this qtn. 
 
Based on my observations,  blocks opp my flat kenna Enbloc n my current place is a big plot ratio. If no Enbloc in the pipeline I lagi happy. Though here not as happening as MP, Tampines, Jurong or even central Spore, I still love this place.

My HDB was built in 1971. When I bought it 4 years ago its super run down with funky smell. The owner died - not in the flat and it was estate sale. Got it below valuation by 12k coz signs Option before getting valuation. Top floor unit in the low HDB blocks at Stirling Rd. I hope they dont SERS coz not much land around here to build so many units (whole estate many low floor HDB with low plot ratio) Later move me if en block to some ulu place with no MRT

Once in a while I do enquired with the HDB: how much longer the flats can be safe (water dripping at void decks intermittently from soffit, beams, with/without rain). 99-years lease with such flaws?

I don't do well in densely populated estate. Plus the prices there r crazy.

Qpik why not just stay where you are since you like it so much?
 
If HDB decides to enbloc in the future then see what they offer you as a replacement before you decide.

cos I will tio HDB behpio called resale levy $45k cash.

Without knowing too much about your development it hard to say if can get En bloc? Is there potential in unused GFA in the estate which can be used by the new development?

5I = 5 improved
 
So far, I hv checked maximum permissible plot ratio for my current place is 2.8 (same as those blocks that was Enbloc). Based on the Master Plan, the storey height control is 30 but now revised to 36. Currently, all the blocks here are 12 storey. I am a noob where all these GFA, Master Plan are concerned but my worries regarding Enbloc are not unfounded.
 
I do not want to be going through what some old folks have gone thru. I spoke to some residents who used to stay across the roads and were affected by SERS. Mostly of them are retirees who have fully paid for their flat.
 
Yes, they get compensation. Yes, they were given a choice in getting a new unit at same estate.
 
Even with subsidized housing, they had to downgrade to the smallest yet equally expensive unit.
 
To compound the problem, with the new ruling in CPF, most of them had their $$ "locked up". 
 
They are not eligible for HDB housing loan so they have to pay 10% of the purchase price as downpayment. Yes, they could use their CPF savings but they have to set aside for minimum sum.
 
If the CPF they have withdrawn for their property has reached the valuation limit, they need cash to repay the loan.
 
Then they still need to set aside for renovation. To sum it up, the irony is they have the $$ to even pay off the flat but it is locked up in their CPF due to minimum sum, valuation limit etc.
 
Even CPF Board advocate that by age 55, we should have fully settled our housing loan. Refer to : http://mycpf.cpf.gov.sg/CPF/my-cpf/reach-55/Reach55-5.htm.
 
Problem is most retirees have fully paid but because of SERS etc, they will be saddled with housing loan. Some of them couldn't afford to stay in same estate and was given friendly advice to move to Puggol, Sengkang where flats are much cheaper. Unfortunately, they ended up spending more on travelling cost as trips like going to hospital cost more, food cost gone up (food court), groceries done at NTUC as wet market might not be within walking distance,
 
I had a relative who gone through above. But, she was worse off. Due to financial issues, she lapsed in her flat payments. It was repossessed and sold off at a profit but she wasn't entitled to the profit though.
 
Based on what are happening to these folks, call me paranoid but I am planning to avoid falling into the same situation.

If I am in above scenario, I will qtn whether I will have to forego the opportunity of being compensated with a new flat or let go of my private property. Or if I want to avoid paying the resale levy (if applicable), by getting another from resale market, can I still keep my private property.
 
I guess for a definite answer, you will have to turn to HDB.
 
That's what I did.

paiseh, i don't hold pte property so i can't share share.
 
the only issues that i clarified with HDB are:-
1) can i buy pte property as i am currently staying in hdb
2) how much resale levy do i hv to fork out for a new hdb flat
 
i did noticed that EC/DBSS bought direct fm developer n also which was launched after 9/12/2013 are not subjected to resale levy.
 
Those affected by resale levy depends on when they sold their first HDB (bought direct). my sis hv to fork out $100+ cash or deduct fm sales proceeds as her flat was sold bfore 3/3/2006.
 
as for Chucky, I felt he wld be in a btr position to decide on his next course of actions after clarifying with HDB directly cos there are so many unknown variables and these kind of qtns, best to obtain from them.

10th storey?
 
hmm not many around.
 
if based on what yr fren has shared, than most HDB renters are only paying sky-high prices to stay max 60. then why tenure is 99yrs.
 
imo, if cpf guidelines are one shd be free of housing loan by 55yrs of age, then we hv to relook at hdb flat. stick with design of olden days, don't build fancy but nvr maximise flr area ones just to put an exhorbitant price tag to burden citizen.

not many left..
 
 
but old flat.. unless reno alot if not .. due to the ancient design.. the living space could be very small..
 
but very sturdy at the same time..

probably they project as passing down to our dependents , if any..

yes, those red bricks are very sturdy. 
 
I used to stay at cck design build 5rm. In it's 7th yr, alot of stuff I deem structural issues surfaced. After failure to nail it to my fault, they tai-chi to TC.
 
Seeing the internal improvement costs that I hv to absorb shd I continue stayg there, I sold at a loss n looked very hard for red bricks flat.
 
Passing down of flat to dependents is a gd intention but alas they don't live up to it as before we kick the bucket, the flat might be subjected to SERS. And nowadays given the prices, I think pple are passing down the housing debts just like Japan. Is this what we want for subsidised housing?

Given your scenario of how some retirees were worse off after their flats have been selected for SERS, and how people have the illusion of HDB flats as good as freehold due to SERS, it's just kicking the can down the road. One day when SERS stops, a whole can of worms will be opened.
 
And I do have some suspicion that SERS is also another way of weeding out people who also have private property, and are still holding onto their old flats. By the current rules, these people are not entitled to pick a replacement flat. This idea, I like.

Actually,  apologies if I hv conveyed that hdb flat is freehold. 
 
When I started thinking of getting a flat,  I never thought that I would have to change it due to quality issue least of all amenities/transport infrastructure that never materialise despite the promises.
 
By having SERS, retirees who have fully paid are saddled with new loan after they passed 55yrs and this contradict the guideline.
 
If these folks are not restricted by minimum sum, valuation limit and they already have the stipulated amount set aside in their Medisave. It actually is a feasible scheme and the flat lease starts anew subject to tenure of replacement flat. They hv roof over head, no worries abt svcing loan. And hv cash for their daily expenses.

Sis, no need to apologise, I wasn't referring to you, but was referring to a general public conception that HDB flat is as good as freehold, with all the SERS coming into picture. It's one of the "evil" that pushes flat prices higher and higher despite the remaining lease becoming lower.
 
I also wonder, can retirees use the lease buyback scheme to reduce their loan amount? At least it wouldn't be so bad.

hdb is super best. if flat too old, ah gong will juz enbloc, build u a brand new flat and give u a fresh 99-yr lease. and this cycle can possibly go on for generations.
 
better than any pte freehold property.

 
also need to top up money to hdb usually and need to spend extra money on moving and reno etc.
 
maybe not suitable for everyone.

Thanks for the below, I'm not well verse in HDB but I contribute my 2 cents anyway. But ah not knowing the worth of your current flat, location plus your situation and a whole bunch of other factors.  I can only just tell you how would approach it so please take with pinch of salt.
 
1) En Bloc - this would be government initiated its hard to say when this would happen, since your flat was upgraded then its quite unlikely IMO that it would take place soon? Given how hard it is to estimate this I would not really weigh in heavily on this.
 
2) MRT completion - Generally speaking if an area is already a matured estate another MRT wouldn't really do much to increase the pricing. If you bought an area that had no MRT previously that would likely have a better price increase generally speaking, so you have decide is it really worth the wait for the MRT completion?
 
3) Buy EC
4) Get Condo
 
3&4 is worth considering if you can find an suitable area and have the means to make the necessary payments but these are more lifestyle decisions as well since EC and condo provide facilities one can use. I'm only suggesting this to go with along with your mentioned concerns which I cannot say how certain will happen. 
 
If you have some funds another approach to consider is rent out your HDB (assuming fully paid) and then invest in a Condo and use the rental to fund your repayments? I have a relative who did this and seem to be doing well, but the market is all over the place now so don't over commit.

Taking into consideration that all flat are 99 yr lease.
 
She is now close to 50yr old.
 
Let says that if she will to sell her flat in 20 yrs time, her unit will be 60 yrs
old, with the lease remaining for 39 yrs.
 
How much do you think that her flat will fetch?
 
600K or less than 400K??

 
We won't know what will happen in future. Maybe the gov need to use that piece of land in another 10 yrs time and give ur friend priotiy Q for new flat in prime area?

40 yrs old flat if in a great central location and reasonable price is a good catch especially if you manage to get a 2nd pte apt later on then you can easily rent out the hdb flat cos of the location. In less than 20yrs ur rental would have covered everything.
 
If never manage to get a 2nd pte apt also no worries. When u r old and assuming not enuff retirement funds can easily rent out 2 bedrooms and collect rental as mthly retirement expenses. Location is very impt if you are to get older flats.

If your flat kena sers development, HDB will arrange a brand new flat for you around the area and will pay you $xx,xxx to renovate your flat.
 
The best part is your lease will be reset back to 99 years again.

Walau....don't understand just ask. Don't be too clever.
 
For example:
A hdb property of only 65 years of tenure left can only borrow up to 5 yrs.
 
So if its a 40 yrs old,then how to buy? I don't suppose all cash?
 
May be you are ignorant of such policy in place ???

I think it depends on the borrower's age, not the tenure of the flat.
 
My friend bought an old flat in Potong Pasir estate. His flat ia at least >30 years old.
 
He got the bank loan based on his age.

Think not many flats older than 45yrs old....
 
If one is 50 yrs old, think bank only willing to loan up to 12 yrs I.e. 62yrs old retirement age
