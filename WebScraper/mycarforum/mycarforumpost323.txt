I think when ppl ask this question means they already hav the money but from investment perspective, what is the a gd time? I guess it is very subjective unless there is a clear economic downturn which brings all property prices plummetting southwards.

1. I read an articules in ST recently. There is clearly an over supply but why the sudden rapid take-up rate of properties? These are fueled by speculators, en bloc sudden rich and FTs. Net result? most of these properties are not meant for occupants but for collecting rents in the immediate future or future.
 
2. So where to find so many heads to fill up the vacancies? All are waiting eagerly for the IR completion to hopefully fuel the prices even higher, so that they can sell later at higher prices or command a higher rent.
 
3. Nevermind lah, let the rich one go and buy and buy more and more. It will come a time whereby they will just sell and sell but at lower prices. It is a question about holding power. If there is no real need? why buy now not as if there is suddenly lack of space in Singapore. So many unsold flats and unoccuppied condo units.

What's your take? Will there be a mad rush if prices drop a little in light of the many waiting out there? Wouldn't that bring about "seller's market" again, i.e., prices will go up?

if you are talking about Investment...you can wait a liitle longer, maybe end of the year or early next, but if you really intend to get a private property for your stay, the prices of some good ones are quite reasonable now, but  make sure you sell your existing one first, don't get stuck for no reason. happy hunting!

search for the district or condo you interested in and look for the trend
 
it is more or less constant now but i foresee prices to drop though not so soon. So it depends on how long you can wait.
 
Another thing, for new condos, some developers may say take up rate is high and most of the smaller units are sold but from past experience, it seems that these 'sold' units are actually retained by developers to rent out. So do not be mislead by high take up rate.

if that's the case, how far can prices fall? the big pool of people waiting for it to drop will create a nice support for prices i think. 
 
anyway, cannot any how loon whole economy collapse. by then maybe i also out of job    as they say, be careful what you wish for....

Just a suggestion, you may want to look at houses for auction from banks, it should be priced fairly low. Should be a good investment tool. Even if prices go down, i believe you still can make some bucks out of it.
 
Price should be more or less the same as now till after the IR has started. Only then we will see the repercussions or benefits of the IR.

1. Depends on what you are buying? If its condo or apartment, low floor, no MRT, 99 or 999, god forsaken land, unknown developer - even cheap also don't buy!
 
2. If its landed, condo or apartment, high floor, near MRT, freehold, central, near good schools, expatriates icon, established developers - reasonable price, mind you its currently buyers' market hence play hard ball, die die must buy!
 
For point 2 must have deep pockets caused it wouldn't come cheap! Always ready to drive a hard bargain in a situation like this type of offer caused seller may be desperate. Recently, I know one guy let go three condos in good locations all at one go caused lost dearly on stock markets. Some agents or speculators may have the contacts but don't have the money to pick them up & if you have the money, good luck!

if you can spare the cash for reno, then my advice will be, overall it is cheaper to get a rundown hse and reno to your satisfaction rather than get a well reno hse but not to your expectations.
 
Also, houses that was built 70's and 80's is actually of much much better quality than those in the 90's. Example will be siglap.

if it is investment one has to look at the returns that is rental yield
 
property investment is part of one's overall investment portfolio
 
as to when is the right time to buy
 
literally trust NO one
 
Goldman Sach or Merrill L not sure which one but both are NOT to be trusted why
 
when they put a report to buy , they already bought for their clients
 
and when they ask to see, they are creating a negative environment so their clients can buy in
 
I kena from them many times until my a s s is wide open 
 
just like th CTE tunnel
 
NOW you know how big it is
 
 
the safest if you have the money now is perhaps buy convertible bonds (good quality) because the yield can be as high as 10 or more %
 
the other thing is dual currency investment
 
recently I got burnt I played NZ versus Sgd but I am going to keep my nz dollar so I may one day migrate
 
the other investment is just keep by good stocks when the stocks drop to a certain price that you feel acceptable
 
I have been buying OCBC for sometime now it has been giving regular dividend and my grandmother bought ocbc when she was young and was able to sell them in the 1960's to buy a bungalow house
 
now for us it will take a long time but patience is key the to everything
 
 
the other choice is to buy TOTO 8.8.88 $8 millions juicy bucks but the chance of winning is like you are more likely to get so do my in malaysia than winning the first price
 
so to each its own
 
but the most important of all is regular investment will surely win the day
 
when I was younger money in and money out
 
infact it was really stupid at that time, 
 
but I was thinking, I dont know when I am going to die so better enjoy now than later
 
so now it is long road to freedom

$1mil can get relative good size 1400 - 1600sf new 99yr condo in the outskirts.
 
if looking for landed, it's very difficult to say becos each house is assessed individually once the location is determined.
 
however $1mil should be able to get 2 storey 30-40yrold house with land about 1600sft
or 1 storey house with land about 1800sf in the suburban areas.  
the other issue is that you'll need to fork out at least $250k more for reno.

Many people can actually.  $1mil is not much nowadays
however that doesnt change the fact that Kovan residences is still overpriced
Base on current markets, I think about $720 psf is max max max for a project like that.

May I borrow the quote and modify it a bit   
If u have the money and can afford the extra cholestrol; you're always ready to buy my eggs  

 
What cholestrol? Whenever I take breakfast with half-boiled eggs and a plain bread, I always ask for 3 eggs. There is a hawker centre in kallang selling me 3 half-boiled eggs, a plain bread and a kopi-o for $1.70 only.

You got casio not bad liao..... i dun even have watch  
 
 
but i think, to be liveable, 100k reno should be enough. Keyword is liveable.
 
ceiling + wiring, new paintjob, furniture i think you will bring over some from your old place, fittings and pipings if needed. 100k should be enough.
 
I shall pm you a tip, you may or may not find it useful.

OK OK, depends on what is meaning of "livable."
but if you buy a house , i'm sure you want to do it quite nicely.
So to me "livable" is not bare minimum
apologies didnt elaborate.
 
if the house lok lok one, you will need to rewire, repipe, retile, repaint, reroof etc etc....$250k for construction of a 1800sf house is about right.  does not include furniture yet.
 
The result will be quite nice lah. very livable but not the top end branded fittings.

Just up price of egg by 1 cent and a merc is free. No need to buy house cause the house in the chicken farm which is as big as istana is something not anyone can own 
If it is such a lucrative business, how cum nobody wants to take over my trade leh?  
 
As regards point no. 2, the farm land is not mine, it was leased to me for 20 yrs. After that the gahmen takes it back  
 
 

 
Just like house, sure got ppl want to buy. It's a matter of price and whether buyer knows about chicken and eggs.
 
I am sure the lease can be extended before end of 20 yrs if the industry is re-inventing and growing. You got resort units in your farm?

rewire including new ceiling board with cornice, lightings. Repaint, hacking of wall and some stairs, constructing additional 2 rooms and 2 additional toilet, minor reroof and tile, etc. Did it at about 50k.
 
Not fantastic but confirm livable. But based on current prices, i think can get at 100k

I mean livable to a fairly OK standard with some italian fittings possible but not top end for sure.
 
you should know now construction very expensive.
$250k for landed property is average only.
Cost for Alterations and Additions is about $150psf
 
drawings = $10k
reroof = $30k
rewire = $15k
repipe = $10k
 
havent start anything already $65k gone......
 
still got flooring, windows, lighting, switches, doors, toilet accessories, glass works etc.....

I think there is misunderstanding.
 
rewiring = dig up old wires completely 100% and sockets, switches all change.
if house is old, it is better to do complete electrical work.
 
you are right $100k can do but only part revamp.

$50k only is really good price. lucky you.
 
anyway now boh such kangtao already....
 
just imagine, reroofing alone is about $35k already.
Reroofing means not only change tiles but changing all the support beams as well.
 
 
construction is enjoying boomtime now.
Contractors/interior designers/builders making big bucks.

price is good but of cuz there is minor hiccups and work is slow. but for the price, i can bear with it.  
 
for reroofing, if the house is built in 70s - 80s, i will not recommend to do reroofing if possible, beams of yesteryears are built to last, rather then those in present times.
 
This IMHO i believe is a misconception, if old must change. Especially the foundations of the houses.

ya. but the point is which house to buy. there is actually alot of things that is not told to you by the agent.
 
For eg: land is 2000sqft but how much can be used as built up area is a totally different thing altogether. 
 
Some land area are big but not all can be used as built up which means to say those area not allowed are actually waste land or to sound nicer, is called garden.  
 
or what cat is your house under, as stipulated by SLA, i think is something like A to D, with D being that the area with highest possibility that SLA will take back the land to built roads, etc. And they will pay you only nominal sum, not market rate, and nominal means $1  
 
Also if land is near main road, you got to check also if the land is 'lent' to you by SLA or do you own the land. An eg: those houses at Upper East Coast by the main road, the land is big but i heard SLA owns part of it and 'lend' it to the owner since they have no use for it but can take back any time, but of cuz agent will not tell you that, they tell you land area is big and price is cheap so you buy, if SLA take back the land, you see your garden suddenly disappear and your house is now super near main road, everyday smell smoke.  
 
etc, etc
 
So the simple Ah Q method is not so simple after all

Go take a look. Its really quite nice. Better than Hans Grohe IMO.

Just saw the news headline - 
 
'Competition watchdog wants fees guidelines for property agents removed' 
 
This means agents and agencies are now free to set their own fees.
 
The latest development comes as the industry is moving towards self-regulation.
 
Agency bosses responded to the new move, which kicks in on Sept 25, with mixed reactions. Some say this will lead to agents marking up their own fees, while others think agents will provide better service at competitive rates.
 
For more, go to straitstimes.com
---------------------------------------------------
 
any idea whether agents fees going up or down? is this new ruling beneficial to buyers and sellers?

there are many other brands besides HansGrohe that produce quality fittings.
Just visit some of these shops and you can find smaller italian houses and german makes which are slightly cheaper but have more avant garde designs.
 
Of course reasonably priced is subjective.  
In my current home I'm using Zuchetti and Hansa.  
I think they hv a cleaner look than HG and are not more expensive.
 
Teka is up and coming.
