Can anyone tell me if it is legal to build a Kitchen on a roof terrace?
 

I've a Private Roof Terrace which is open & I would like to build an open

concept Kitchen to do my cooking, so that my indoors would be clean.
 

The area is totally covered & no one is able to look in from the outside.
 

Its a Condo not a Landed, so what are the Legality issues here?

Anyone here has the same experience?
 

Thanks.

We tell you can but your condo management say cannot also LPPL...... 
 

Ask your condo management whether can erect a kitchen.. 
 

mostly they will tell you to erect only in bed...

from my knowledge - no. they will cite loading issues etc (roof terraces are not built to withstand much weight). they will also say roof terraces were not specifically designed for heavy cooking (so even if you cite BBQ etc, they will say those are *extremely* occasional). 
 

however,i'm a little unsure about your roof terrace since you first say its open (unsheltered) then you say its covered. please advise which one it is. if its currently open (no roof), then placing any kind of permanent structure to cover the area will result in exceeding GFA, which is a big no no.

Whether it's legal or not, you'll have to get pass many layers of office, it seems.
 

Just get a few of those portable electric cooking stoves and cook up a storm since nobody can see...hoho.

If you build a kitchen on your roof top, i think your neighbor confirmed will complain that your smoke will dirty their place.

Its actually an open roof terrace, I've got 4 walls covering it, but the top is open.

I've got a short trellis followed by an awning to cover it from the rain & sun.

the open roof terrace is only good for occasional BBQ, suntan, night tan if you call it..

Building a kitchen? Hell no way..

if no one can see what you doing, then why you bother can or cannot 
 

roof terrace can do many things, like:
 

1) roof garden  
 


 

2) Garden with Water  

3) mega jacuzzi   

4) RC heli launching pad  / RC plane runway 

5) water proof sound system for roof top naked parties

I'm not asking for Opinions, I'm asking for experience or people who know the rules & regulations to this subject.
 

Condo Mgt will always say NO to everything, this is to ease their problems & work load.
 

It is always good to know your rights, so you don't do what you shouldn't & not just listen to Mgt alone.

A second opinion is always helpful.

A kitchen is counted as part of the allowable gross floor area. An open air roof terrace may not. Hence, it's not a simple case of condo mgt wanna "ease their problems & workload" but it's their duty under the MCST to ensure that there are no violation to the approved building plans.

technically, roof terrace is not designed for heavy cooking usage. they will cite plumbing issues (grease trap etc) and I would assume no hob, so leads to pollution etc. 
 

basically - if you want this to go through ... get govt body approvals before the mcst. once you have govt approval, *most* mcsts will allow you to do the reno. (and i can say this, because im currently chairman of 3 different building mcsts as part of my job)
 

however, based on my past experiences, im not optimistic about your chances bro. but no harm trying i suppose.

not enough. even when PE submits, govt bodies like SCDF can come in and say fire hazard. you will *also* need SCDF approval for this, and from my experience with them, they have no qualm asking a business to shut down if it doesnt conform to rules. scdf approvals range from a few hundred $ to thousands, depending on scope. yours should be maybe few hundred i assume. 
 

it really depends on what you wanna do. you see, the problem with SG is the "if he can, why i cannot" mentality. you are *improving* the value of your property by doing a minor alteration. therefore, your property price (in theory) should increase. you now have an extra selling point also, down the road. your neighbors may feel unhappy you have one leg up, and try to copy the same, or do something better .. (or worst, depending on your taste). this will lead to the facade of the building changing from what was submitted, if everyone wants to follow your footsteps ...

Ok, I understand better now...So, you are saying that if I get the papers, MCST has no say? 

Or they will still have the final say?

mcst will claim need to put it to a vote, blah blah blah.
 

if you go to them now and ask - they will say check with govt bodies. thats why i say ask them last. if you let them know too early, they will be on alert. sometimes its better to catch people off guard 
 

the submission etc, paperwork will cost you between 5-10k, so you have to decide whether or not you want it done.
 

also, make sure you dont mess with the GFA if you want the plan to go through (and no, i dont think theres a way for you to "buy" more).
 

your PE may suggest retractable awning but *if* im not mistaken, those motorized ones are considered permanent structure (you have to check on this yourself though). most PE always tell me that the easiest way to get approval is to make sure *everything* is non-perm.
 

hope that helps bro! good luck

i mean if you are not putting in a mega commercial kitchen to sell food, only a stylo milo open air kitchen, and that gfa is not increased, no one can see what you doing, i really dont see whats the problem  
 

i mean a lot of people hold roof top parties, sure got bbq  , kong ming lantern   , loud music, beer, ciggi and babes!!!!  
 

but as good neighbours, must keep the noise down, must install those oilly smoke filter machines  
 

i envisage it should like something like this:

if i were you i just do. i mean i put roof garden, put water feature, put jazcuzzi, put table, put chair, put king kong size umbrella, put bird cage, put beach chair, put carboard, put bench, put swing, put dog house, put cat house, put bat house, all these surely no need mcst approval right
 

trellis is a different issue.....that one kena gfa problem....need ura (1st) and mcst (2nd) approval.....
 

anyway, i dont think mcst has right of entry or inspection.....remember 2 case?

1) if nea think your house is some alien breeding dengue ground, they also need 2 weeks for court to give order to knock down your door, if no one at home after 2 weeks

2) some joker never pay maintenance donno how many years, owner donno go where already   , no one staying there, not rented out, donno how years later then the court give mcst the approval to knock the door, sell the unit to recover maintenance marnie
 

but at the end of the day, the bottomline is still neighbourliness    your one consider good liao, at least your one all ang moh, some condo now majoirty CN, PH, IN

One last question, in your experience as a Chairman, have you ever experienced residents engaging Lawyers to fight for their cases...just in case, I'm thinking of worst case scenario...



 

all the time and for petty squabbles. my job is quite easy ... all the properties which i manage, my boss owns a substantial amount .. enough that no one can outvote me or knock me off the council  of course, i never abuse it because i'm not the one occupying the property and i try to be fair (people want extra lot, and if bldg got, just give lo ... leave empty also whats the point)
 

neighbors have been known to sue each other and there have been quite a few recent cases (one involving landed property in bukit timah recently, iirc reading about, and a few other condo ones ... i normally get the pdfs via email to read the entire case)
 

if you are suggesting that *you* want to hire a lawyer to sue the mcst ... dont waste your time. the only people who benefit are the lawyers ... there WILL be a lot of animosity in the building after that ... its just not worth it bro.
 
 




if i were you i just do. i mean i put roof garden, put water feature, put jazcuzzi, put table, put chair, put king kong size umbrella, put bird cage, put beach chair, put carboard, put bench, put swing, put dog house, put cat house, put bat house, all these surely no need mcst approval right

actually bro ... you are wrong. sorry to tell you. anything that alters the facade can be subject to MCST approval as long as it can be seen (ie from another building, from the road etc) so if you put an attap hut on the top, and your neighbor's building is taller and they can see it ... they *can* complain bro.
 

secondly, mcst always has the right to inspect. they have to have a reason, and if they suspect you are using your terrace (for example) dog fights, they can ask to check (or in most cases, mcsts have lawyers that they can use to write to you ... and as a paying member of the mcst, you will essentially be paying part of the lawyers fees as well .. lol)
 

if you just go ahead and do what you like, the mcst can ask you to spend money to tear it all down ... its really not worth the hassle. plus, everyone in the bldg may single you out later and give you the "tu lan" look. imho, not worth it.

actually, i recently heard about a portable grease trap (and they have a service whereby the guys come to collect the grease every few weeks). if you use a portable one, that may save you the headache of drilling etc. you can tell the PE to use that, and since its not a permanent fixture, anytime can take down (like i said, govt bodies, mcst all love non-perm fixtures)

all the time and for petty squabbles. my job is quite easy ... all the properties which i manage, my boss owns a substantial amount .. enough that no one can outvote me or knock me off the council  of course, i never abuse it because i'm not the one occupying the property and i try to be fair (people want extra lot, and if bldg got, just give lo ... leave empty also whats the point)
 

neighbors have been known to sue each other and there have been quite a few recent cases (one involving landed property in bukit timah recently, iirc reading about, and a few other condo ones ... i normally get the pdfs via email to read the entire case)
 

if you are suggesting that *you* want to hire a lawyer to sue the mcst ... dont waste your time. the only people who benefit are the lawyers ... there WILL be a lot of animosity in the building after that ... its just not worth it bro.
 
 
 
 

actually bro ... you are wrong. sorry to tell you. anything that alters the facade can be subject to MCST approval as long as it can be seen (ie from another building, from the road etc) so if you put an attap hut on the top, and your neighbor's building is taller and they can see it ... they *can* complain bro.
 

secondly, mcst always has the right to inspect. they have to have a reason, and if they suspect you are using your terrace (for example) dog fights, they can ask to check (or in most cases, mcsts have lawyers that they can use to write to you ... and as a paying member of the mcst, you will essentially be paying part of the lawyers fees as well .. lol)
 

if you just go ahead and do what you like, the mcst can ask you to spend money to tear it all down ... its really not worth the hassle. plus, everyone in the bldg may single you out later and give you the "tu lan" look. imho, not worth it.



 
 

whoa!!!! who so hiong go and put one attap chu on roof terrace!!!    this one too much lah!!! this type confirm mcst come and catch

i've seen a lot of strange things managing buildings bro. i have seen a small zinc style hut built on a building before (torn down already due to it being an illegal structure) ... people *will* try anything as long as they can get away with it (in this case, the guy was using to store dry goods)

The baseplate for the 4 posts is supposed for bolting down onto the floor.

Without bolting down, I think the 4 posts would be unstable.

Of course, an alternative is to use a metal floorplate for the parking lot, and bolt down the 4 posts.

Lucky kids.
 

The owner should build a small observatory to see stars if one has a roof terrace of that size.
 

That would be something special for the kids.

Agreed! I saw a few places with roof terraces, but when I asked the agent whether I can install a roof or trellis to provide a bit of cover - the answer was always "no"!
 

So in the end, the terrace becomes wasted space.
 

Really hope TS can get his wish - cos there's lots you can do with that!

Because when you change the facade, it may block other people's view.
 

I remember there was one time I was considering this new PH. It was suppose to have an unblock view towards Singapore Flyer. 
 

But when I look directly from the roof terrace, coincidentally the view of the flyer and only the flyer was block by another PH across the street simply because that chap erected a roof for his plants. So he has all these tall plants on his roof terrace blocking the flyer.
 

So in the end, I didn't purchase that PH. You can imagine how mad the agent was over the other guy across the street.

mcst will claim need to put it to a vote, blah blah blah.
 

if you go to them now and ask - they will say check with govt bodies. thats why i say ask them last. if you let them know too early, they will be on alert. sometimes its better to catch people off guard 
 

the submission etc, paperwork will cost you between 5-10k, so you have to decide whether or not you want it done.
 

also, make sure you dont mess with the GFA if you want the plan to go through (and no, i dont think theres a way for you to "buy" more).
 

your PE may suggest retractable awning but *if* im not mistaken, those motorized ones are considered permanent structure (you have to check on this yourself though). most PE always tell me that the easiest way to get approval is to make sure *everything* is non-perm.
 

hope that helps bro! good luck 
 

(fyi, my best suggestion to you is this ... join the council to understand the inner workings and get to know everyone. then there shouldnt be so much resistance. )




One of the considerations is whether the kitchen appliances / furniture are permanently fixed to the roof terrace ie movable (not bolted down) or non-movable. Movable items are usually ok.
 

As for the shelter for the person doing the cooking:- good size, non-permanent outdoor retractable umbrellas etc can be used as shelters for domestic type of cooking.
 

There is no rule against BBQ, in fact some developers even provide BBQ pit on roof terrace. Bbq produces more smoke than simple domestic cookings generally. Most likely there is also no rules against the use of BBQ facilities on a daily basis as long as the users don't create nuisance one way or another when they BBQ or cook. So normal cooking activities should be ok if you don't cook like zi char style which is very smokey.
 

Roof terrace is designed to take a certain maximum live load eg outdoor furniture, aircon condensers, potted plants, water features, portable spas, etc. Whatever equipment/furniture you put there for cooking have to stay within the max allowable design loads.
