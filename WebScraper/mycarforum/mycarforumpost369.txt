Starting a thread for noob questions you always wanted to ask, but didn't dare to or didn't know how to. Let me start the ball rolling.
 
Why does property appreciate? Does it not experience wear and tear like any other material possession? Is it because of demand vs supply and inflation?

When will property prices stagnate or drop here in sg? Also, incomes don't seem to be growing at the same rate as property prices.

Are we always screwed? As long as I buy a resale property, not only do I pay an appreciated price, I also have to contend with inevitable maintenance costs further down the road.

Where incomes are concerned, the largest variable is household income. That variable is growing faster than property prices actually.
 
https://www.singstat.gov.sg/-/media/files/publications/households/pp-s24.pdf
 
Another way to answer your question is that property prices did drop in 2009 as well as from 2013 to 2016.
 
As for price stagnation, we can see stagnation these couple of months, and probably slower growth in the year ahead (or stagnation).
 
Still another way to answer your question is that property prices (for ageing properties) will depreciate (drop) towards the last 30 years of their lease, as a borrower cannot use CPF to finance the purchase, and also banks are not able to loan.

can be explained as part of demand and supply
 
factors affecting demand (income, age, status of buyer, pricing, location, development potential age etc)factors affecting supply (cost and development charges, land supply, development/marketing potential)as for depreciation, it is not directly affecting demand or supply or even prices.  but indirectly it does because newer property is always more attractive, freehold will generally sell for more than leasehold 99 in the same area same age.  unlike cars, where the price offered has strong correlation to the straight line depreciation of the asset.

Yes, it does experience the same wear and tear like any other material possession, however, we also have to take account of the appreciation of the intrinsic value. If the intrinsic value (land value) appreciates more than your wear and tear, you have a positive investment. Just like cars, not all cars has zero value at the end, certain models become collectibles and even see their values go up. 
 
An extreme example just to illustrate a point. Imagine you bought this piece of land that has 99 year leasehold in a third world country, say 500k dollars. Technically, at the end of 99 years, it should be zero. But imagine during this 99 years, may be at the 50th year, this third world country developed into a first world, and so happens that your land is now in the middle of its CBD...

Pretty sure talk on property here has high and low profile of people have had owned, flipped or even sold for profits, be it old walk up, 10-15 yo condo or even bigger scale of enbloc millionaires, leaves no stone unturned.
 
I'm sure there are some with great insights and vision better than T2 capabilities to see towards next century, where pig can fly and no road tax, all cars here will be tap of a button and cruise to your location.

For most average guy, property is a roof over the heads for the family, not an investment. While you need to commits on something beyond your current saving, it should be within means with calculated risks. No way to save enough to buy it cash unless you belong to another group.
 
So, if you consider this an investment, it is always the correct one.

What happens when (starting) incomes keep growing but property prices stagnate or drop?
 
This already happened from 2000-2005. When we had too many homes and not enough buyers, and HDB took 7 years to sell out its housing stock.

With technology advancement, the building of new BTOs nowadays is primarily based on actual subscription.
 
Gone are the days of queuing up physically for a chance to subscribe, and Govt build ahead of demand by anticipating demand, then release it for people to queue up for the slots to buy.
 
Nowadays, all checks (eligibility, finances) are done before one subscribes to a unit, and one suffers penalty of some form if the subscription is subsequently withdrawn. 
 
Selling of balance flats are also much more hassle free than in the past, depending on online subscription to register. In the past, one had to make a trip to HDB, collect a stack of the list of balance flats and their prices, then figure out where they are, before booking through HDB.
 
The building of new units is now tailormade to the actual demand. Reduction in BTO supply has already begun, although there are still basic numbers to be supplied.

Yes HDB is now stuck in a mode where they're afraid of the past and resulted in undersupply after that.
 
The original point was: even when incomes grew, when there are more homes than there are occupiers, rentals drop, valuations drop, loan limits drop and home prices drop. Too much of this leads the whole market to negative equity and a high risk of a systemic problem.
 
My message to those who have never seen sustained price falls before: It has happened several times and will happen again.

HDB had been building 15,000 units of BTOs per year for the last 8 years or so to meet the gap in demand.
 
Rentals drop: Definitely across all sectors
 
Valuations drop: HDB yes, especially from 2013-2017. Private not really, in fact some actually continued to increase.
 
Loan limits drop: Mainly due to Govt regulations.
 
Home prices drop: Only from 2013-2017. 
 
The four years of adjustments between supply and demand has allowed both sides to equilibrate. The current situation is one of matching. Where supply cannot increase further (out of land for private residential properties for the time being), more regulations will kick in to regulate demand to prevent massive runaway of prices as it did the last round (from 2007 to 2013).
 
If demand had not matched supply, Govt would not have kicked in the last round of regulations. Re-read that full statement again by MAS to note the targeted future price increase matching income.
 
As for HDB, if it lowers in price, somebody who contributes to Singapore will get to benefit. No issues.
 

Yes HDB is now stuck in a mode where they're afraid of the past and resulted in undersupply after that.

Why does property appreciate? Does it not experience wear and tear like any other material possession? Is it because of demand vs supply and inflation?

Property is made of 2 very different parts.
 
The land and the building.
 
The building will always depreciate because it experience wear and tear.
 
The land will appreciate if there is demand and depreciate if there is no demand.
 
 
 
20 years ago I went to a bank and in a meeting
 
with 4 men who worked for the bank for 30 years each.
 
They ask me how to depreciate the building.
 
They depreciate their building (not land) over 20 years at straight line 5% a year.
 
After 5 years they added an extension so they asked me should they depreciate
 
the extension over 20 years as is their policy or 15 years?

This is true when there is always demand and sustainable pricing. The same may not be true when there is no more demand or reach a stage the general masses cannot supplrt it. 
 
In our case, it is the HDB. Meant for its citizens to live, now it turns i to an investment that trap them into debts. The faster they separate HDB from private the better. Those who wish to speculate in private, it is their choice.

this is true. 
but we will also have to look at income growth, which is pretty uneven across different segments.
 
when the govt says increases based on income growth, do they meet an average income growth or income growth of the middle and high income for private properties?

My personal view without any hard data is the rich are getting richer while the poor like me are getting poorer. 
Maybe Gini can confirm.  
 
So high end property will do very well as we can attract billionaires for our safe and secure environment. 
 
So if you have a very high end condo or good class bungalow don't sell too soon or too cheap hor.

Yes you can as long as you have used cpf for the private property and it has a charge on the property if not you have to rerank the charge, and you can only use cpf for the 2nd property provided you have set aside half of the prevailing mimimum sum in your SA/OA
 
Sorry, but what is meaning of charge? What is rerank the charge? I am noob.

Property appreciate depends on my factors both micro- and macro- economics, including demand, supply and inflation as you mentioned.
 
I would give you some examples which are key factors for the appreciation as below:
 
1. Unemployment rate
2. GDP
3. Construction or Material costs
4. Future public infrastructure
 
Hope this helps.
