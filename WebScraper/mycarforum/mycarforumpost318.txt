The magical 70% figure seems to be the trend to publish about condo "good" sales figures?

It seems to imply that after selling just 120 units(out of total 360), the developer can take a back seat and be satisfied that the project $$$ is already break even, and no need to sell till TOP comes.
I think many developers are sitting on much profits even if they just sell a few units, could be because the high selling price vs the price of land they acquired allows them to break even easily.
If all the developers are in this good situation....then the fall in properties prices may not happen within the next 3 years???
 
 
adding that if all 120 units released are sold, it would hold back the remaining units until the market improves.

90 units put up for sale, but still have 30 in reserve -- if response is good. Depending on how you count it, it's just 50% sold.
 
$200 million for 360 units, their base cost is $556k/unit.
 
$1.5k psf seems rather high. It's leasehold somemore.

Just saw night news......120units of The Peak@Balmeg fully soldout after 2 days private viewing, avg 1000psf.
 
WOW....what recession? Seems like More good years are still expected in Singapore!
Or at least many Singaporeans are still confident that the property will recover in 2-3 years time. And many are NOT going to miss out this time round to gather cheap property noand sell it for a profit when the next good economic wave comes in 4-5years time???

You're affiliated to CBRE or Hong Fok or you're interested in this development?
 
This is the 2nd time you post regarding Concourse Skyline.
 
Anyway the view is very good. I personally think the inner city facing stacks are safer as you don't know what sort of developments will spring up at the empty plot just in front (at the opposite side of Nicholl Highway).

No financial nor political vested interest.
Just for discussion.
Some say market down...some say market up....how developers like to ues the 70% to announce their 'good' sales.
 
I only went to skyline showroom to look see look see, because my friend said he wanted to get a unit downtown. So I was following only this condo to see how is the sales result.

well stats are stats and surely there will be one or two exceptions. high probability that OVERALL prices are on a downward trend as published by the papers today.

BTW, how's the current payment method for condos? I asked several friends and have a few versions. 
 
The version I think is correct (cos that friend works in CDL). He said, we have to pay 5% cash, sweep everything from the CPF, is it like that?

This has been forewarned since last year.
 
Many of us have already anticipated whatever is happening now.
 
Kelpie, for one, can attest to that. 
 
When the market pushes itself so hard, it needs to take a rest.
The question now is how much rest.

economic cycles are getting shorter and sharper. perhaps the next upswing will be quicker than usual.
 
 
We are only at the beginning of the downward spiral, so i dont dare even talk about upswing.  
 
One key index is the unemployment figure.  
Once unemployment figures start to consistently march upwards, you can be sure we'll be in trouble.  And i do see quite some big numbers in the private sector.
 
Hopefully the folks here have been saving well during the good times so as to ensure a plushy cushion, otherwise we're gonna see lots more cars going on sale soon.
 
As for properties, the sales wont disappear overnite.  People still need a place to stay.
New home buyers and upgraders who have worked hard and saved well in the last few years will benefit.  Properties with good location and environment will always sell, all it takes is a more reasonable price with a change of economic situation. 
 
The household income ceiling for HDB is ridiculous.
It's forcing young couples who prefer to be more down to earth to get into debt which can ultimately destroy them.
 
A property is a person's biggest "bet" in life especially the first one.
dont bite more than can chew.

What facts do you base on?
 
This is a financial world crisis and it affects and causes most business to slow down now. Currently it just starts the 1st phrase, companies are merging to fight for survival. The next phrase will be followed by retrenchment, it can last many many quarters till those companies' financial report reflected positive and stablize.
 
I believe this crisis is very severe to the world and we can only see recovery in the 1st half of year 2010. Time to have your belt tightened and clear all your debts. Good luck to all!

Lesser cars will be seen on the roads when the economy is bad. Then it will follow by the drop of property price. If one has a lot of cash then, it is a very good time to pick up a good car and property at a very good bargaining price during the crisis.

I believe he meant the income ceiling is so low yet the HDB price is so high. Some couples are also force to move to condo because of the HDB low income ceiling. 
 
Frankly, a couple cannot be out of job at all, else how to pay up the HDB (not even condo) since they already have to use up all their OA CPF monthly (some still have to top up in cash)??

Income ceiling -> not eligible for new HDB flats and HDB loan. Still can buy resale HDB flat. Doesn't mean must buy condo. Most common reason given: we want a new flat. Must be virgin. Sure...
 
The $8,000 ceiling has a loophole. It only applies to monthly income and does not include (non-guaranteed) bonus. Just tell your company to cut your pay and shift it to your bonus!

two points.
Yes, can buy resale but this artificially pushed up resale flat prices.
To whose detriment?  To the people who need it most.
 
Secondly, we should not be living base on loopholes.
Policies which force people to contravene via loopholes should better be scrapped in the first place.

my friend is rich la. He wants to buy I just follow him lo. 
You may be right, I think I do see the better side of life with the type of people I hang out with. That is why I like to come to mcf to have my reality checks. I need you to bring me down to earth and see the real Singapore. This is a discussion forum, so it's good to hear your point of view vs mine. 
P.S I went to have my brazilian wax today.

are you going to show me? put place and time then.
 
need me to come and be bideo man?

...   ....no wonder every year, the bankrupcy numbers also follow the public transport fares trend and the age is getting younger... ...
 
but hor, on another tone, does that means younger generation people are more "daring" ????...older people are more "conservative"??.......

true...but in reality speaking, most of sggie are speculating on property and are taking huge loans...that was the answer i got from the agent where i attended a property launch...if anything happens, alot of sggie will be in big trouble... 

you need to have many many smart SGean to expose to huge loan then the market can move mar, if market goes wrong, the smarter one will benefit from it, this is part of the economy.

I knew of many relatives/friends who are specualtors.
These so called property speculators are holding on to 2 or more preperties bought in 2004-6. Most of the properties would have upside of 30-50% profit.
 
The big question I asked them is "Under what type of situation will make these speculators let go of their properties?"
 
Their answer:
Since their properties are not in negative equity, the urge to fire-sale may not be strong. Even if the property price index were to drop by 20-30% over the next 2years, some of the speculators will still have upside profit on their properties.
If they can tahan for the next 3 years for the economy to recover, then they can potentiall make TONS of $$$$.
Even if the units are TOP, they have monies in their bank to finance the bank loan for atleast 1-2 years(assuming the worst case situation where they are out of jobs), but if they keep their jobs, then financing the additional loans will not be an issue.
 
So I got the feeling that this time round, the property market in Singapore is unique. Speculators are still very Rich on Paper and will not sell-out.
The holding back of these group of speculator will help to keep the private properties price stable and high even thru the poor economic times in the next 2-3 years....perhaps.
 
Maybe only those few speculators who did not opt for the delayed payment will have problems financing their extra properties.

those bought before 07 and did not opt for the deferred payment might have problem but if they are speculators, they will opt for this scheme...
 
if i recall correctly, the deferred payment scheme has been abolished for new projects, those who speculate on recent ones will  
 
the problem now is there are quite a large number of speculators buying those projects after 07 where the property bubble is at peak..

Hey...I thought it will be a lomantic mano-a-mano lunch date with you my handsome prince.
Why are you calling others to join? This is not a mass OG leh.
Maybe you can organise the others to go see the Skyline showflat, then we can discuss more about this particular condo!

is not the matter if they opt for deferred payment scheme, if they do not opt for it, is better cos that shows they really have $$$ to finance the purchase. 
 

the problem are with speculator with more than 2 properties with defered payment scheme but loan not secured when they make purchase. Now TOP is drawing near, they can't off load in time and need a loan, bank are damn bloody CAUTIOUS recently......
