  Dr Ng: Housing problem has been decisively tackled 


 March 15th, 2014 |  Author: Editorial

 



Minister Ng Eng Hen

 
Wrapping up the nine-day debate on the Budget and Committee of Supply (COS) this week, the Leader of the House Ng Eng Hen compared this year’s debate to the one held in 2011.
He said the difference in the issues raised showed there has been significant improvement in some areas:
 
 
MPs were also pleased that the housing problem has been decisively tackled. The results speak for themselves – shorter waiting times, lower costs and greater affordability of housing pushed MND off the hot seat, to the relief of Mr Khaw’s eyebags.
All in all, this year’s Budget and COS reflect a House holding true to the course which the President set when Parliament began in 2011 – ‘to build on our strong foundation together, to give all Singaporeans a better life and brighter tomorrow’.

 
 
Has the housing affordability issue been decisively tackled? Let us see. It is a good thing that Singaporeans have the internet these days.
In Parliament last March [Link], Housing Minister Khaw Boon Wan said more will be done to reduce BTO flat prices relative to income, and to reduce the financial burden of housing on the young:
 
 
We have stopped BTO prices from rising by delinking them from resale prices. We can now pause and see what else we can do to bring BTO prices in non-mature estates to, say, around 
4 years of (annual) salary as it was before the current property cycle started.
One thing is clear. We are committed to restoring and maintaining the affordability of new HDB flats to the vast majority of first-timer Singaporean households. Their Singapore Dream of owning their own flats, like their parents’, is safe. We will make sure of that.

 
 
Notice that Mr Khaw used the term “restore the affordability of new HDB flats” and notice that he also avoids talking about resale flat prices and prefers to focus on new BTO HDB flats.
In an interview with the Straits Times last April [Link], DPM Tharman said:
 
 
Over the longer term, I do think that we will be better off with housing prices being a smaller multiple of incomes for the average person especially.
For the low income group, we’ve got very substantial grants and subsidies. But for the average family, average young family, including those who are in the upper middle income group, and those who go for private condos included, we’ll be better off as a society and as an economy in having a more steady growth of property prices and the multiple of property prices to incomes being somewhat lower.
It’s important for us to keep prices in check so that younger families feel that housing is affordable and don’t have to put so much of their disposable income into servicing their loans. I think that’s the right long-term objective.

 
 
Let us look at a recent BTO launch in January 2014 to see if Mr Khaw has fulfilled his promise. Remember, he said he wants to bring BTO prices in non-mature estates to around 4 years of annual salary, as it was in the past before.
Punggol BTO Jan 2014 [Link]:
 
 

 
 
Typical 3-room:
Nett selling price less grants = $165,000
Applicants’ median monthly household income = $2,800
Price to annual household income = 4.9

 
Typical 4-room:
Nett selling price less grants = $300,000
Applicants’ median monthly household income = $4,400
Price to annual household income = 5.7

 
Typical 5-room:
Nett selling price less grants = $430,000
Applicants’ median monthly household income = $6,000
Price to annual household income = 6.0

 
 
Obviously, Mr Khaw has yet to fulfill his promise to bring down BTO prices in non-mature estates to around 4 years of annual salary.
In fact, if he wants to fulfill his promise, he should be selling the new BTO flats in Punggol now for about:
Typical 3-room: 4 x $2,800 x 12 = $134,400 (19% discount from current $165,000)
Typical 4-room: 4 x $4,400 x 12 = $211,200 (30% discount from current $300,000)
Typical 5-room: 4 x $6,000 x 12 = $288,000 (33% discount from current $430,000)

expectation management goes a long way in "tackling" the housing problem. before 2011, many people could not see the light at the end of the tunnel, they didn't know when they would ever get a house.
 
when khaw boon wan took over, he swiftly moved many of these people onto the "waiting list", and these people can now see the hope. the actual number of flats hasn't increased yet, but people are already being appeased.
 
does this take skill? of course, this is politics. but if people like mah bow tan can't even manage people's expectations, it's no wonder why he had to go.

Actually our MND is very efficient and kind to citizens already.  If you have a job, chances you can own a flat. You compare our region countries like China and Hong Kong? The parents must take mortgage loan so that their children can buy flats for themselves. This debt is pass down from generation to generations.

indeed, this is a self-proclaimed success.
 
but looking at objective factors, it's apparent that even the opposition no longer takes issue with housing during this year's budget debate. instead, the focus has shifted to transport and healthcare. i think there is indeed some basis for claiming success.
 
just hope that they don't let this become cyclical and few years down the road find themselves with not enough flats again.

let me quote "cheap is no good, good is no cheap" ... govt says one
aiya ... even sell bto 4-room at $200k also wont tap into reserve la
the major cost of bto is land cost and land cost is 'perceived' cost ... the land can be priced at $10M $100M or $1B
if the land is priced at $100M and sell to hdb at $50M then lost $50M lor ... but not actual money hor
if every land even ulu ulu at sengkang and punggol is priced at orchard .... hdb/sla/govt lose billions of dollars la
hearsay, jurong is the next orchard liao ... lol

even if the opposition shift focus, may not mean that the govt has done a good job.
 
it could just mean that they acknowledged that there is "something" done and moved on to another bigger problem..
 
success in bringing costs of HDB to be more affordable?? smlj, got diff in price meh? who make it high in the first place..

Agree. Oppo cant press to reverse back prices of public housing.
 
Even if ever happen, too many households will go into negative equity, then banks knock knock. Another big problem born.

you obviously have not seen some of the quality of the new houses eh? 
none of my walls are straight or flat. the bloody curvature is so huge, all my skirting is about 1 inch from the wall~!
then the walls? after about 3 years in the flat, start to see seepage in the walls around the bed room windows area.
then the toilet leaks from the ceiling? complaint liow. now waiting for HDB to engage the contractor to fix the issue so that we can share the cost with the top unit.
 
i could easily list another 10 things.
what cheap-thing-no-come-good-good-thing-no-come-cheap BS~!
my mother's unit bought at half the price i paid, had nothing of the problems i listed / encountered in my unit~!

but some are really cannot be fixed DIY style.
with the kind of increasing cost these days, i am finding it harder and harder to squeeze some extra cash to engage contractors to fix some of the problems. (ie window leaks when heavy rains with wind blowing toward house direction). and this kinda leak is maciam like pails of water wan hor.
 
everytime i manage to lower my consumption, some blardy thing will increase again to dilute that "savings"

i tot about it.
1) cannot afford the COV 
2) the shelf life of a resale, given the trend of enbloc happening to older units. ahgong scared balless about the potential enbloc scenario when ahgong and ahmah retire and gov decide to enbloc my unit.
then whatever retirement saving will go back to the g coffers again.

The PAPzis released the genie from the lamp, and now cannot be put back into the bottle. so now trying to contain it but the genie getting bigger and bigger everyday and cannot be controlled soon... let people earn paper profits to boost their popularity, but once the housing price rise, cannot reverse the price anymore or else the people suffer bank $$ calls...
 
talk abt a catch 22 situation now for the poor common folks, who dun wan their property price to fall but the young ones cannot afford housing at the astronomical rates now..

MND is already very kind compared to other countries.
 
The problem is due to our greedy and ingrate mindset where we keep expecting the govt to treat us well as they have done in the generation before us.
 
I hope MND will continue to remind and educate us to not compare with singapore's past, but to always compare with hong kong and other cities that are worse than us.

Why do we always need to compare to the worst to justify that we are doing well?
 
Can't we compare against the best (in current situation) or against the better past? Logically, we can only honestly measure how well we are doing, by comparing against the best. To compare against the worst then we will always be on top... and lying to ourselves too..
 
Its not that we are greedy, we just want to have what we used to have before the country was messed up over these past 15 years....

sigh... always comparing with those worse of than us will not spur us to improve loh.
there will always be someone worst off than you.
 
the way to move forward is to compare yourself with your old self. are you better off today than you were... say... 5 years ago?
if not, what is holding you back?
if yes, is there room for improvement?
 
that way, we will always be looking forward for more good things to come.
 
if we always compare with other people who are worst off than us, we will never develop or prosper~!
maciam like, you are driving a BMW today, you compare with the one driving the Altis, you are better off.
tomolo, something happened and you downgrade to an Altis or some other BnB car, you will then compare with the one driving the Hyundai Hatch. you are still better off.
then something else happened, and you drive a Atos. you compare with the one driving the chery qq, you are still better off.
and something else happened and you downgrade to a motorbike, you compare with the fella who owns a bicycle, you are still better off... and so on and so forth.
but are you really better? THAT is the question~!

Yes agree.
I think the MND over the last couple of years have started to pull up their socks ... compared to the MND in last decade or so.
Similarly, the MOH and MOE have made progressive, but significant policy changes over the last couple of years too, for the betterment of citizens and the next generation.
 
Change is there and we're seeing it also from the MOF each year, now focusing on health care and the likes.
 
These are all progressive and good.
I'd definitely give them a few more years to show what they're made of ...

Why dont let their kids study in neigbourhood school since it is as good as MOE

When MPs and gangs walkabout , do ppl free they are there to understand the ground or are there to get support for votes ?
You are always entitled to your views. Others have theirs.We're a democracy.
If they continue to deliver good, even bit by bit, they are indeed doing well.
People have eyes. We shall see. 
No need for words, or bad-mouthing disclaimers - it doesn't work in a democracy.
You have your vote, if that counts!

Why do we always need to compare to the worst to justify that we are doing well?
 
Can't we compare against the best (in current situation) or against the better past? Logically, we can only honestly measure how well we are doing, by comparing against the best. To compare against the worst then we will always be on top... and lying to ourselves too..
 
Its not that we are greedy, we just want to have what we used to have before the country was messed up over these past 15 years....  

 
Don;t compare with the best or the past. Situation is different. Singapore is unique ok
 
Times have changed, policeman dont wear shorts now.

Yes, you're right... my vote will definitely not go to those traitors in white...
 
democracy is about rule of the people by the people for the people; not to serve the self-interests of select groups....

sigh... always comparing with those worse of than us will not spur us to improve loh.
there will always be someone worst off than you.
 
 
 

 
We will keep comparing ourselves with selected cities until the time comes when we are the worst of the lot.
 
Then we will stop comparing and say that it's not a fair comparison.

Yes you're right that Singapore is unique... we don't need to do what others are doing the right things, so long as we are doing things to show that we are always lumber 1 ... even comparing to the bottom of the barrel also can, as long as we are shown to be better...
 
Last time policeman in shorts can still catch thief, nowadays policeman in long pants run away from rioters! hahahahaha.... are we better now??

indeed, this is a self-proclaimed success.
 
but looking at objective factors, it's apparent that even the opposition no longer takes issue with housing during this year's budget debate. instead, the focus has shifted to transport and healthcare. i think there is indeed some basis for claiming success.
 
just hope that they don't let this become cyclical and few years down the road find themselves with not enough flats again.

However, if our heroic comrades did not give the opposition the chance in Parliament, do you think that the housing issue can be solved "decisively"?
 
How many years have we been living with the high cost of housing? And they can called it a success? Politicians are really thick-skinned.

Those unhappy people say only la. When GE comes, everything will be forgotten, dont think it will be lower than 60.1%.

Even if it is lower than 60.1%, they will still say they won. Anywy, we know we cannot replace the MIW because LKY had built a fortified castle around them with Vitamin M. We can keep them in checks but can never replace them.

No need to replace them, if can keep them in checks good enough. If not due to the last GE result, you think they will change so many policy and things?
