1. I'm wondering what happened when a flat gets really old like say 40 years old? Would it be considered for redevelopment? What would happen to the existing leasehold tenants? Don't want to pay $500K+ for an old flat in matured estate and kena chased out in a few years time.
 
2. Would a flat's devalued quickly when more than 30 years of age? I'm seeing that older flats built around 1976 generally are valued alot lower than the newer one at the same location. it could be of $150K+ difference in valuation.

Old flats either get enbloc or undergoes MUP.
mine underwent MUP few years back. it was terrible, almost like a construction site and no toilet to use for abt one week. everyday must use cloth to block the dust from coming in 
if is enbloc, then HDB will offer u priority to choose a unit nearby  
Generally the older the flat the cheaper it is

A relative of mine was staying in bukit ho swee where the flat is like 30-40 yrs old. Come enbloc the residents there got priority to choose nearby location and also got grant to move. In fact, some pple wanted to buy the old flat from them to get entitlment to new flats, especially so if it's a good location. So i suppose location is still the key, not the age of the flat when it comes to holding value.

Some of these older flats are not really well built. You can see the coarse workmanship and some of the staircases are actually slanted. As you've said, they only have the location to offer. Other than that, I wonder if it is for conducive living?

1. What do they do for MUP? Do you have to pay? I was told under some MUP, some even got an extra bedroom, true?
 
2. In the case of HDB, do they compensate those enbloc residents based on valuation?

You got to check about the financing aspects as well.... 
 
Some banks may not wish to finance leasehold HDB flats that are above a certain age...

Yeah, probably need to spend quite a bit to retrofit the interiors and piping works as well. Depends on which estate though, I feel that the old flat less than 20 yrs is still ok generally. Anyway, buying resale should have a wider choice in terms of selection compared to limited locations/choice units etc for new flats.

This i got to disagree. It really have to depend on the market as well as location. An old block in Holland can be of a higher value than new flats in Punggol area.

I guess there will be substantial risk to buying old flats at such high prices now.  I dun think the flat will last longer than another 10-15 years coz it is likely to be redeveloped.  If genna enbloc, the 'compensation', which I believe would be of open market value, may not make up for the high price you pay now plus reno etc. Think the risk would be higher if the flat is older.  My bro-in-law was also offered a 5 rm appt at Marine Parade with fantastic view.  It is 30yrs but seller asking for 730K.  I told him to seriously reconsider.

That was my exact reaction when I was told.  The seller is definitely trying their luck. Was told it was on a very high flr, very well renovated and had an unobstructed sea view.  Dun think I would commit so much for a 30+ yr Edge Dee Bee flat.  This price can get a very good new condo already.

With that money...i'd rather use it to buy a condo in the suburb area or hold on to the cash waiting for the property slide.

The other day, had a chat with a property agent on marine parade flats with sea view...many pple won't realise that the view is indeed refreshing, but only for perhaps the 1st year. After that, the buyer will start to regret paying so much for that flat

HDB got a scheme called SERS - Selective Enbloc Redevelopment Scheme. 
 

they will compensate the tenant market rate of the flat and on top of that, they will give the existing owner $30K or 20% off for the new flat they purchase, the tenant also entitle priority to select a replacement flat build by HDB. if the tenanat do not wish to wait, they can sell it with benefit in the resale market.

I read some1 in renotalk.com actually paid 50k+ cash over valuation for a 3A flat. She thinks dats a good investment because according to her the estate slated for SERS. So she can get 30% off the new unit which she feels is a long term investment.
 
For me..no way...

Same here, I will not pay $730K for a 30yrs old leasehold HDB flat. I think my threshold would only be 20 years or less regardless of view and location.

I wonder how much time do people living in the high floor spend on looking at the view each day? However, people do assume that high floor = better air quality and less noise, true?

I think we're spoliting the market by paying more than $30K COV at this moment. I've also viewed a 4A flat with "stock" condition, asking for miniumum COV of $60K .

Bottomline: It's a HDB flat. 
If the intention is to buy and live, think can get relatively good flats at much more realistic prices.
If it's for investment purpose....it's a HDB flat. What else do I need to say

Paying an old flat for $730K, are they expecting more upside to the HDB market ? Got money to pay high valuation and high COV, should go buy good quality Private property instead.

I think too many people buy flats in hopes to profit from it. IMO, most of us 'peasants' should buy flats within our comfort range in terms of pricing and loan amount. 
 
Same goes for buying a car. Don't over stretch, and always remember to factor in the extras that cost money too. For cars you factor in (other then your installments) - petrol, servicing, insurance, car goodies, ERP, parking .etc...... and for your home (other then your installments) - renovation, furniture, appliances, a multitude of household stuff, utility bills .etc.
 
Personally I don't think you should use an "investment mindset" as a deciding factor when purchasing a home. Instead look at it over the long term and as a place that you'd be staying in for years. Yes prices may still go up in the long run, but Singapore's rapid growth is tapering off in contrast to the rest of the world. We are already a 'first-class' nation in an economic sense, how much faster can we grow? 
 
Furthermore, using your home/flat/real-estate as capital for investment is pretty much like putting all your eggs in 1 basket. What happens when you buy an overpriced place and can't sell it off later? In addition, you are still paying your butt off in installments in cash every month? That is precisely the situation that you do not want to land in. It may be profitable, but given the current economic trends, do calculate and weigh the risks. Your home is not something you should gamble with. (Unless of course you have 2 or more properties. Then that may not apply   )

Mine is already 30+ yrs and now undergoing LUP.
 
I think HDB always to come in and enbloc after XX yrs. Becos if the resale is not strong that means these are old tenants and their loan already fully paid so HDB dun earn anything already.
 
The best is enbloc it, sell them new house, make them take new loan then existing land make new apartments and sell new again. So in market always got people taking loan and make money.
