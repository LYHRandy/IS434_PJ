Looking at the resale market, and considering buying condo that is 8-9 years old this year. Is for staying and not renting.
 

Is this a bad investment? Some people tell me never buy 99 years condo. Say next time cannot sell. Is this true?
 

Let's say i buy a 9 years old condo $600K, and stay for 15 years. It will be 24 years old by then. 
 

Can it be sold then or too old to sell? What about the value? Will it drop significantly because it's so old and leasehold? How significant a drop, 1/2 price, 1/4 price? What if there's a property boom then, possible for it to retain it's value?

for leasehold apartments, very much more depends on the location and site in terms of resale.

much more than freehold ones.
 

all things equal and considering no boom nor slump in economy, 24yr old leasehold will not hold value as much as freehold.that is just common sense.

and becos of that, it is not so demanded as it ages.
 

never buy something thinking only of upside. be realistic and assess honestly.
 

99yr leasehold is good as an investment in the hot areas.

the ROE will be higher simply becos the price to buy is cheaper yet the rent is not.

leashold or freehold has no impact on rental. 

so to buy leasehold properties looking for rental returns , just make sure location is solid.
 

as for buying to stay, there are other considerations. a lot more than just monetary values

if money is seriously your only main consideration, then maybe you cant really afford to stay there.
 

my personal view is for properties to generally fall another 25% at least. 

I'm looking at freehold in D9 at $800psf.

thats my target.

old rule:
 

you cant bagai your own hardearned $$$ in ur CPF to buy any 99yr leasehold pte property which has less than 75yrs of lease, most likely commercial banks wud oso turn u down not to pinjam $$$ for u to buy.
 

e.g: 9yrs + 15yrs=24+developing process 2-3yrs, it is oredi 26/27yrs of age.
 

lets say over tis 15yrs, good economy, property $ escalate to $9OOk or even more...........

if i hv tat $9OOk imay as well go n buy newer unit, or younger age leasehold.
 

new rule:
 

sorry i dont know, sorry if my infors r salah leh.............Gong Xi Fa Cai every body..........

Thanks for reply. Condo ownership in Spore have gone up the past decade. What's going to happen to these 99 years condos when they get older and older? What's going to happen to the owners who owns old condos? 
 

HDB is also 99years, but we see almost 20years old flats bought $70K new from HDB, few years ago selling for 200K, now selling for 300K. And they are selling like hotcakes, even the old HDB flats. Why can't the same thing that happen to HDB falts happen to condos, where prices become 3x or 4x even when it gets older and older? Why is everyone saying condo price gets lower with time?

Hi Bro, HDB is for mass market. The demand is always there as prices are considered affordable. Prices are very stable as compared to Private condo. Most speculators will buy private to speculate and make big bucks. For HDB, prices are very stable as not many people are keen to buy to speculate. It is more of a necessity for HDB folks.
 

Hope this answer yr questions.

Coz HDB got government support mah. Things like grant for those staying near parents, subsidized loan etc , makes it a lot easier for pple to buy.
 

Also, HDB property tax 4% versus private 10%. HDB dwellers got government handouts in bad times, private none.

for 99yrs leasehold..chances are, some developers will come in and en-block even before it his it's 50th year..if you buy when property prices are low, chances are, you can make a tidy sum during en-block..

Isn't HDB pricing (new and resale) tied closely to private pricing? 
 

Otherwise if HDB due to lower tax, grants, govt support, price stability, etc continue to rise, and condo price continue to fall, then 10-15 years later condo become cheaper then HDB, possible? If this scenario do happen one day in future, a condo and HDB side by side, same size, same location, both 20 years old, and condo selling $100K cheaper, you will buy which one?

That's what I thought too, price go up with time, property boom, enbloc.
 

Property price, regardless HDB or 99years private, should rise over time, due to inflation and lesser available land in spore. So how can HDB price double/triple and yet 99year condo price depreciate over time? Overpriced HDB vs cheaper condos' with facilities, that'll be the day, lol :)
 

But the 25years CPF ruling is the killer. Hope they change that ruling before the current batch of condos becomes unsellable in future.

That again could simply be wishful thinking, and highly speculative Shull.
 

there is no guarantee that developers will buy or the sellers will sell.

chances are 50% - 50% at best
 

ultimately it's difficult to make money with one property, unless he risk his primary roof.

Sorry, a lot of babbling but never make my point earlier.
 

My point is again back to the thread topic, 99years private bad investment? Cos if HDB can up and up (with a few downs in between, like now) and is considered a good buy, why leasehold private is bad buy? leasehold private really is downtrend over time?
 

Because got people tell me, dont buy leasehold private is very dangerous old liao cannot sell and lose value, get HDB instead. So i wondering why is it like that and if that is true?
 

As for affordability, I can definitely afford either comfortably. Is just that people are warning me against leasehold private so I am just being prudent and seeking further opinions.
 

Also thank you for your advise on location, yes, location is a priority for me, definitely must be near local amenities and MRT station.

nearing amenities and MRT is not the only things to look out for in terms of location.
 

many people mixed up location with site.
 

location should refer to the district and thus forms the base price.

site refers to the actual environment at the location and forms the add-on price
 

total price is made up of base price + add-on price.  

that is my personal formula, i invented it but you are free to use it.
 

in another thread on landed property, i discussed about the add on price factors. perhaps you may want to visit that thread to have more info.

IMO, its about location, location and location.

in 2005, some good location LH condo going at $300psf could reach a whopping $800psf in 2007. 
 

If this is going to be your only live-in property, you may not enjoy any gain when prices shot up.
 

For investment, you need to have at least 2 pte property so you can take advantage when economy picks up.
 

We live in a LH unit. Sold 1 last year and now rented out another FH unit. 
 

Again, buying from resale market is not yet practical. Look at the papers and you will realised seller are asking ridiculars pricing.

location, amentites, ease of transport etc is also important especially for rental

Times are different now, but many ppl are still talking about old thinking.
 

CPF funding is now pegged to balance 60 year lease instead of 75 yrs.
 

http://ask-us.cpf.gov.sg/explorefaq.asp?category=23098
 

Leasehold property last time nobody try to enbloc, but 2 yrs ago.. several 99 yr properties managed to get enbloc and lease topped up. 
 

There is really no basis to compare between HDB and leasehold condo living. Both cater to different and very distinct lifestyles. Among these 2 options, there is no obvious better choice, as what is food may be another's poison. Is really subjective to what kind of environment a person want to live.  HDB offers substantial cost savings, which many ppl fail to appreciate until go live in private property. Is a question of cost vs exclusitivity.

Not ordinary tables....but he wipes golden tables for higher mortals. 
 

Nonetheless to TS, here is my personal view.
 

There is no good or bad investment; only good or bad decision. All decisions are good, otherwise one will not make that decision.
 

Do you intend to buy for own stay or do you want buy for investment such as rental yield / capital appreciation?
 

Different objectives will mean different criteria for selecting a property; be it leasing or FH / landed / non-landed. Ideally we all want to have both - own residency and capital appreciation; but those maybe found in D9, 10 and 11. 
 

I am pretty sure some leasehold outside typical 9/10/11 may also have the same potential, however, those may not be your preference, such as distance relative to town, parent place, work place, mrt etc etc....
 

If one likes the place and has the intention to stay there for long, then just go ahead to buy one when the price is right. Otherwise, stay at Newton One in sub-600 sq ft apartment oso no shiok.

By the time you have on about 75 years left in the least, it'll be extremely hard to sell, because banks also don't like to finance.
 

If it's for staying for long term, it can't even be viewed as an investment. A proper investment should generate income. So unless you are renting out the unit, then maybe it might be an investment. And the whether it's a good one depends on its location and nearby amenities.

For my side it works like this,
 

1st thought is the place must be comfortable when we enter as we are gonna stay there

2nd would be the price

3rd what are the benefits of this house either for capital or yield appreciation.
 

If it meets all 3 criteria then to us the house is a good buy.
 

Thats why once we stay in a new house 6mths down the road we will start to househunt again and this will take 1yr or 2

Thanks. So if i go ahead with my plan, i will be stuck with the property for good once it nears the 25 years mark, that is not good. Nobody in thew world wants to be stuck with a property that cannot sell. 
 

I will be staying in the condo and is not for rental, but seems like if i buy LH, can only stay a few short years and then sell, to stay well clear of 24 years mark. Cannot be a home that my children grow up in liao, otherwise cannot sell end up becoming a home that I grow old and die in :(

It really depends on the plot ratio. Govt dictates how tall and how many units you can built within a plot of land. Some 99 leasehold have huge space that can be re-developed and pack more units hence the enbloc potential. If a small 99 leasehold development already has very high density, it will have very little enbloc potential. Having said that, 1300 sqft that is of reasonable size today, could be conisdered huge in 20~50 years later. So only time can tells.

IMHO, only buy 99 leasehold for speculative purpose but not for long stay. You want to live and die in, landed property is still a better choice. You can find one with huge garden and bury in there.
 

When a 99 leasehold aged, potential buyers would also be concerned on how to dispose it if they are in financial hardship. In addition, buyer will find it increasing difficult to obtain bank loan for old leasehold unit.

I'm afraid so. Buying a 99 LH will eventually means you'll be stuck with the property. Unless the plot ratio of that development has room for growth, then maybe it can be enbloc someday far into the future.
 

I don't mean cannot buy and that you have to scrap your plans. Seeing the economy is bad, wait a bit more and shop for good bargains.  You might even be able to afford FH somehow.
 

Remember for properties it's all about location, the view and floor height.

I agree. If the purpose is to stay, then FH would be the better option. Buy LH only if you are going to use it for speculative/investment purposes. If one really wants to buy LH to stay, then stay can only be for a few years before one should sell it off to avoid making a loss. My personal opinion - if one wants to buy a 99-year LH condo to stay, one would be better off staying in a 99-year LH HDB....the new DBSS HDB flats (built by private developers) these days are just like condos, minus the frills...

Looking at the resale market, and considering buying condo that is 8-9 years old this year. Is for staying and not renting.
 

Is this a bad investment? Some people tell me never buy 99 years condo. Say next time cannot sell. Is this true?
 

Let's say i buy a 9 years old condo $600K, and stay for 15 years. It will be 24 years old by then. 
 

Can it be sold then or too old to sell? What about the value? Will it drop significantly because it's so old and leasehold? How significant a drop, 1/2 price, 1/4 price? What if there's a property boom then, possible for it to retain it's value?



 

I see a lot of TOP dates of the 99 year lease started quite some time already, so by the time you move in stay a couple of years and dan wanna sell it will worth little.
 

Depending on what your plans are. If you plan to invest, dun buy 99yrs. If you plan to stay there for good, sure buy it. But sgporeans all very kiasu one, all want freehold cos in actual fact it's more worthwhile.

Sorry to tag on condo thread for my question related to leasehold landed. I wished to start a new thread but couldn't as I'm new here.
 
I recently got an offer for a single-storey leasehold landed property at a price of $300k. But the remaining lease is only 25 years. The historical market price for similar property I found online (sometime Oct 2014) was about $550k. Only thing is I have to pay cash.
 
2 scenarios that run through my mind: 
 
a) $300k for 25 year. Say I fork out $25k to touch up, total is $325k. That work out to be only $1.1k per month, which is even cheaper than renting a whole unit either HDB or condo. That seems not bad. 
 
b) For $300k, I can pay 20% downpayment for a $950k private condo and after legal fees, stamping fees etc still have maybe $10-20k left.
 
However, I was made to know leasehold once expired the government will take back without compensation and the owner (become tenant then) will have to find alternative premise at own accord.
 
Honestly, I skew towards landed, hence my question really.
 
My friends from Malaysia got to stay in landed for much cheaper cost but they have to bear with dilemma that some day after their groceries shopping they find a stranger sitting in the kitchen waiting for them, or even at night when wanted to take a drink from kitchen and switch on the light only to find a stranger there. So I thought if one wants to stay in landed, Singapore is the place to be.
 
I like to ask folks here that would you even bother to put in your time to consider this offer because it has so little life left that makes it so unattractive? Would it be a waste of money in such a case?
 
Welcome your thoughts and comments.
 
Thank you!

The price appears too good to be true ... almost 50% discount ... 
 
Need to ask yourself whether you can see yourself staying there for a substantial portion of the lease as it would probably be very difficult to find another buyer.

Thanks for comments. The offer came from reliable party, let's not doubt that part.
 
I have no alternative residence, i.e. no property from parents and no own property yet. Currently renting. 
 
So is either continue to rent or buy. It will be 100% own stay, as such rental yield is not really a concern.
 
I guess my main concern is buying a short-life leasehold landed would equate to renting, but worse off because have to bear upkeep and maintenance. End point is the same, don't own anything. 
 
Only attraction are the compound for car park and small little garden (for kid), open roof kitchen (for wife).

But, still need to bear in mind that maintenance for this type of housing isn't cheap. Leaky roof, chocked pipes........
 
Even simple things like replacing basin tap will incur 3x the price compared to same job the handyman will charge for a HDB flat.

I have no alternative residence, i.e. no property from parents and no own property yet. Currently renting. 
 
So is either continue to rent or buy. It will be 100% own stay, as such rental yield is not really a concern.
 
I guess my main concern is buying a short-life leasehold landed would equate to renting, but worse off because have to bear upkeep and maintenance. End point is the same, don't own anything. 
 
Only attraction are the compound for car park and small little garden (for kid), open roof kitchen (for wife).

$300K is like a car with 10yrs coe
This has 25 yrs
If it suits your need , grab!

What is your age group? Do you have children? These make a difference to how the options should be evaluated.
 
 

Sorry to tag on condo thread for my question related to leasehold landed. I wished to start a new thread but couldn't as I'm new here.
 
I recently got an offer for a single-storey leasehold landed property at a price of $300k. But the remaining lease is only 25 years. The historical market price for similar property I found online (sometime Oct 2014) was about $550k. Only thing is I have to pay cash.
 
2 scenarios that run through my mind: 
 
a) $300k for 25 year. Say I fork out $25k to touch up, total is $325k. That work out to be only $1.1k per month, which is even cheaper than renting a whole unit either HDB or condo. That seems not bad. 
 
b) For $300k, I can pay 20% downpayment for a $950k private condo and after legal fees, stamping fees etc still have maybe $10-20k left.
 
However, I was made to know leasehold once expired the government will take back without compensation and the owner (become tenant then) will have to find alternative premise at own accord.
 
Honestly, I skew towards landed, hence my question really.
 
My friends from Malaysia got to stay in landed for much cheaper cost but they have to bear with dilemma that some day after their groceries shopping they find a stranger sitting in the kitchen waiting for them, or even at night when wanted to take a drink from kitchen and switch on the light only to find a stranger there. So I thought if one wants to stay in landed, Singapore is the place to be.
 
I like to ask folks here that would you even bother to put in your time to consider this offer because it has so little life left that makes it so unattractive? Would it be a waste of money in such a case?
 
Welcome your thoughts and comments.
 
Thank you!
 
 
Regards,
Dino

Thanks for reply. Condo ownership in Spore have gone up the past decade. What's going to happen to these 99 years condos when they get older and older? What's going to happen to the owners who owns old condos?
 
HDB is also 99years, but we see almost 20years old flats bought $70K new from HDB, few years ago selling for 200K, now selling for 300K. And they are selling like hotcakes, even the old HDB flats. Why can't the same thing that happen to HDB falts happen to condos, where prices become 3x or 4x even when it gets older and older? Why is everyone saying condo price gets lower with time?

In my view.  indeed for 99 years leasehold.  It make sense to have a good location and nothing but a good location.   Once the property aged.  It has the potential to be en-blocked for new development.

I think its a no-brainer.
 
Why pay $300k upfront when you know at the end of the day it will be zero value when the lease expires. Put the 300k to better use.
 
Since you are already renting just continue to do so or look for a better investment. Don't buy just because its cheap.

The appreciation is limited and future buyers in future are also restrained by the 0 loan tenure.
Not for me if its my choice.

Buying such property is not for appreciation.
Its like a car , an expense.
 
If its cheap enough to expense off, then its ok.
Treat it as long term rent.

Agree with T2. But generally depends on the TS age and the horizon in view as well.
 
Many people, in trying to avoid the expense (depreciation), ends up incurring more expenses, or loses in opportunity costs foregone instead. The difficult part is actually in figuring out what happens to the money that is not spent (the amount that is saved and reinvested).
 
Assuming he takes up option 1, after factoring in possible renovation, the depreciation of about 15K annually to live in a landed space appears quite feasible. However, I am also tempted to ask why not consider resale HDBs as the first property (unless can't meet criteria) with easily 80-90 years lease and above. Note that if buying a house with 25 years lease, you are unlikely to be able to use CPF and must most likely use full cash.
 
https://mycpf.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Schemes/schemes/housing/private-properties-scheme
 
If you have 300K in CPF plus cash, it is roughly enough to buy many 3-rm HDBs here. So do consider carefully the fate of your CPF for first property.
 
Private condo based on loan, must see your appetite for risk and whether having facilities is important or useful for you, as well as what you intend to do with it over the long term. The days of huge gains are likely over, and nobody knows how long it takes to tide over to the next cycle. Worst case projection for the next three years have to be factored in. Over a longer time horizon (definitely over 10 years), based on history of housing price movements and long term strategies of SG, I believe (not guaranteed) that prices will continue to grow, but there are various complications like rental situations and interest rates that you have to consider once you are in.
 
Ultimately, it is a highly individualised call you have to make. Nobody knows your situation better than yourself. Have fun and best of luck!

Really appreciate the inputs guys! Very helpful.
 
T2, I like your viewpoint using the car analogy.
In fact my skewing towards landed is also partly due to my car interest. Having your loved car parked at the porch area and able to pamper it anytime (wash, wax, detailing) and have my kid wash my 18" rims since he has the right height and once done spray him with water until the wife grab away and dry off the kid! Then I'll grab a cup of hot tea, sipping while circling round and admire newly clean buddy with the microfibre cloth on one hand and the other hand with the the tea already turn cold.
 
Sorry gotta stop on car!
 
Back to Property, under the 3 scenarios below, #1 is most certain.
1) Revert to the government without compensation
2) Given an option to either revert to government or pay for renewal
3) Automatically renewed with a cost (like it or not) and no option to return to government
 
In the remote chance of getting lease renewed, what's your guess* on the renewal fee/cost? 100% of prevailing market price? 
 
* I use guess since I'm guessing none of current Singapore leasehold cross 100 years yet, I may be wrong.

This is a very interesting question.  If no emotions involved, you should analyse using Net Present Value of the cash flow.  I did a simple model to compare the 2 options just out of curiosity:
 
Landed with 25 years left, assuming 250k up front and 10k, 12k, 14k, 16k repairs every 5 years.  At long term 4% discount(interest) rate, you will be negative 270K NPV.
 
Condo - major factor is how much you think the condo will be worth 25 years down the road.
Assuming 20% down payment, 48K instalment per year for 25 year loan at 4% long term rate, the NPVs would be:
 
selling price in 25 years    NPV
1.5M                                  negative 362K
1.9M                                  negative 218K
950K                                 negative 561K
1.7M                                  negative 272K 
 
So technically you will be better off buying the condo if you think it wil be worth at least 1.7M 25 years from now!
 
Assuming property taxes, condo maintenance (3-4K a year) and cash flow no issues!  And do note they are all NEGATIVE NPV, unless you sells the condo for more than 2.5M!
 
Good luck hunting!  Best option is to bunk in at parents' place.....

One difference is 25 years later a fully paid condo with 70 years lease left versus expired landed. And also likely need a replacement 25 years later since he sounds very young. So get another property with 25 years lease then?

i think if the location and condition of the place is acceptable, and with 3 bedrooms, I will buy. Even if I rent it out for $2K/month, I still make a decent sum for 25 years.  Some companies may be able to squeeze 10 or 20 foreign workers in it.

have you done some checking on the masterplan of the land or the surrounding?  any potential road widening or land reclaim coming?
 
What's behind the house? a slope? a hill? it makes bloody hell of headaches when comes to landslide problems. 
 
also, u check on the frontage distance of the house? 
 
check on termites problem?  is the underground piping done according to regulations?  Check on all past works done to the house and make sure all is done within the legal controls.  This type of old house, past owners could just anyhow do the works without getting approvals.  When u take over the house, u may face problems.

its always the same for most of us.
 
Think think think, then do
 
What actually happens between the think think think before the do is
 
Think, -- Market go down, job becomes not sure if able to hold
Think some more --- cooling measure kicks in
Think abit more - new policy kicks in, TDSR
 
What to do, Price already move so much that you missed the boat and hopping to have the price drop which is black hearted...
 
Repeat again when the next cycle of downturn, But now so many road blocks
 
sometimes its a lot of focus has to be there. Squeeze trigger then don't look back.
 
Else age catching up. When the next downturn, I think I'll be gone by then.

When you are buying to flip the property, 99 lease in a good location is a good buy when the price is right. Nobody can tell you when this is happening but if you got deep pocket, anytime is a good time.
 
If you are buying for keep and pass down the generations, then obviously free hold or 999 lease. Many countries don't even have 99 lease. So 99 is actually quite long just getting loan maybe problematic.
