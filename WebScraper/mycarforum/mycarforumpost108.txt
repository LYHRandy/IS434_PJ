Singapore sub-sales at 8-year low
 

Mar 4, 2014 - PropertyGuru.com.sg
 
 
Speculation has all but disappeared from the Singapore property market, with the number of sub-sales recorded during January 2014 hitting an eight-year low.
Data from Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) analysed by PropertyGuru yesterday revealed just 37 sub-sale transactions were recorded in January 2014 – the lowest monthly total since February 2006.
 
The current lack of speculation and “flipping” is in stark contrast to July 2007 when some 928 sub-sale transactions happened during that month alone.
 
Donald Tan, Managing Director of Chesterton Singapore, told PropertyGuru: “Sub-sale rates are nearing an all-time low after successive government cooling measures.  
 
“The introduction of Sellers Stamp Duty (SSD) and two rounds of Additional Buyers Stamp Duty ABSD) effectively increased a short-term speculator’s transaction costs by as much as 34 percent (15 percent ABSD assuming a foreigner plus 16 percent SSD assuming he sells within one year holding period, and a further 3 percent of usual stamp duties and legal fees).
 
“In the last two years price increases have been a paltry 2 percent to 3 percent per annum, and such capital gains are easily eroded by ABSD and SSD transaction costs. Those who had bought are holding assets for the long haul; short-term sellers will be lucky if they can make a decent gain in the market today.
 
“There is anecdotal evidence that those who sub-sold recently are looking to get out of the market, presumably in need of cash, and hence may sell in today’s market making losses.”
 
Tan added that based on URA data there were only 147 sub-sale transactions in the last three months of 2013, the lowest since Q1 2006. He also noted that sub-sale rates (as a percentage of total resale transaction) was 3.8 percent, well below the 18 percent in 2011 or 28 percent back in 2006.
 
Evan Chung, Vice President, Resale Division for real estate agency DTZ, also noted the effect that successive cooling measures have had on the Singapore property sub-sale market.
 
He told PropertyGuru: “While all the cooling measures have had their desired effect on the broader market, what has affected the residential sub-sales market most directly are firstly the withdrawal of the Deferred Payment Scheme (DPS) in Oct 2007, secondly the removal of the Interest Absorption Scheme and Interest-Only Housing Loans in Sep 2009, and lastly and most of all, the three rounds of Seller Stamp Duties and LTV reductions.
 
“With the lack of easy financing and the increase in taxes that erode the profit of buyers who purchase units and flip them, sub-sales activities have dwindled and these have served to achieve the objectives of the authorities to reduce speculation in the local market.
 
Chung noted an increase in speculation in the industrial sector from the start of 2010 until SSD was introduced for industrial properties in January 2013.
 
He said: “As you can guess, interest then shifted to commercial properties, however as commercial properties generally have a higher quantum the market is smaller for speculators.”
 
Chung predicts sub-sale activity to be greatly subdued as prices cool further.
 
He said: “Those who have bought off-plan prior to the four-year SSD that was implemented in January 2011 would likely be the ones still transacting in the sub-sale market, since they are mostly receiving their keys this year.
 
“Their target market would most likely be buyers looking for new but ready-to-move-in units. Furthermore, if the project is in a good and in-demand location they could still likely lock-in some capitals gains without incurring any SSD.”

 In January 2014 the most popular development for sub-sales was The Interlace, which saw 10 transactions at a mean average price of $1,267 per sq ft, according to URA data.
 
A sub-sale is defined by URA as: “The sale of a unit by one who has signed an agreement to purchase the unit from a developer or a subsequent purchaser before the issuance of the Certificate of Statutory Completion and the Subsidiary Strata Certificates of Title, or the Certificates of Title for all the units in the development.”

for every speculator deterred, another 2 "long term" investor is born
 
To me, all these resale, subsale low figures have no or little bearing on prices..
 
A real drop will only appear if you see a 6 month or longer sustained period of less than 300 new sales per month
 
and coupled with slight increase in SG unemployment rate
cannot let devlopers feel the heat slowly, cos they will not react until much later
 
u have to burn them in oil until their skin turn crispy then u will see a real 20% discount

Unrelated news but I read Blackrock hired a new real estate leader. I'm not sure if Jack Chandler is still around.

the thing is when no demand price goes down.

True, that's why ALL CMs should not and cannot be removed as of yet. At least until an external event affects the local property market here. Developers please suck thumb.

Fact is that it has already dropped 10% , but where are the droves of buyers?
In the bigger scheme of things, after all that has happened, whats 10%?
Only idiots would wait for a 10% move if they are real buyers.

roaring sales? subsale has died for over a year since end 2012. Resale has died too since end 2011. Both are dead and buried, accounting for just 30% of total transactions.
 
Despite subsale and resale being dead, prices in OCR still managed to jump by 7% in 2013 alone. Why is that so?
 
Don't just take the headlines at face value. The media likes to sensationalize old news.
 
As i have said, the only way to see a real drop in price is low sale figures of new launches sustained over 6 months or more. 
 
Look at Rivertrees and Riverbank. Both in crappy location, near to LRT only, More than 500 units sold in their weekend launch alone. Prices not cheap hor.. above $1,000 psf. Next up is 600+ units for sale at Lakeside MRT. 
 
So for those hoping for a real drop in price, probably have to wait until 2015 or 2016. Then again, maybe i'm wrong.

I never ever see any profession no up.
 
I just say dont be a property agent and keep thinking that property market is up up up and any one point in time.

 
I did not imply in my post that market is booming.. i just said that there will not be significant drop this year. 
 
it can be flat, or move up or down 5%. that's about it

Spot on. Another aspect which many are not privy to is the strong demand for overseas projects, having been pushed out of the SG mkt by CMs.
 
This is unregulated by MND/MAS and will be a ticking time bomb (esp for the mom and pop speculators)

Pigeon hole below $1.25M still moving by popular demand
 
yes, i agree with you that $1000-$1200psf for OCR and crappy location is insane

so why still got so many buyers? don't they know that subsale and resale has plunged?
 
That they can get a resale in sengkang for just 800psf?
 
Or they did not read that banks and developers are expecting a drop of up to 20% this year?

Actually not just media, but also the developers. It is in their interest to have a hype and if it is not there, try to create one or at least create an impression that there is one. It then feeds on itself, because there will be people who buy into the hype and then actually become part of it - a snowball effect.
 
To my simple mind, I always think that high prices only benefit 2 groups of people, those who cash out and get out of the property market and property developers/agents. For the rest, the reality is if prices are high, you either buy high, or you sell high and after that buy high, or it is irrelevant because you are not selling/buying. So other than the first 2 groups of people, actually it is in the interest of the rest that property prices be low.

it is actually in the interest of developers as well if prices are low.
 
I can tell you the profit in dollars for a developer when price was $800 psf and now at $1,200 psf is roughly the same. The difference is always land cost.
 
In fact, if price moves to $800 psf now, developers will huat big time cos the sales volume will explode.
 
For agents, when property is tepid, their drop in sale volume will be compensated by higher comm rate. So not much impact to the top 20% agents out there.

But land is always bought ahead of time so in that sense, the land cost is locked in. What I'm trying to say is if the land was bought at a high price, then if prices move down, the developers will have a problem. But if land was bought at a low price, then if prices rise they have more margin but if prices fall, then the impact is soften for them because the land was bought low. So net net it is better for them if prices rise, that is their best scenario to cover the land cost.

T2 has his eyes on prime property only.. which has not moved much over the last few years. In fact it has fallen recently. So he is right that there is a 10% drop there.
 
The real mover has been suburban which has surged 25% over the past 3+yrs. It is still going strong judging from Feb's sales volume

That is also the segment that has the weakest holding power, so once the gravy train stops, the unwinding will happen. Between it being the scale of a small lapping wave and a tidal wave, I think it will be more towards a strong wave, ie. the impact is more than medium but not total devastating. The seeds of the consequences have been planted even before the gov intervened with the cooling measures.
 
As Russell Peters said, somebody is gonna get hurt real bad.

I think so long as QE is there, the musical chairs will continue. Those who sold and now holding cash are the ones who are safest with the profits, otherwise only paper calculation with a loan to service looming over the buyer's head.

I'm referring to new launches, particularly suburban and 99LH, that's where most of the activity is taking place, and also the main driver of residential activity over past 1-2 yrs.
 
if u are talking about broad residential, then yes, it will probably fall. Even if new launches manage to maintain current price level or even go up by 2% as what the developers are indicating, overall residential index will see a drop as it would be dragged down by resale.
 
btw your favourite prime has been dropping since 2Q last year liao, and should be getting worse

bishan 1600psf is not due to location but mainly due to branded architect (official reason)
 
unofficial reason is because someone in capitaland BD was smoking pot and bidded $870 psf for the land (30% higher than 2nd bidder)

My young fren, you will learn in time to come that everything is relative.
Only thing is what leads the market.  And in most situations, the better product leads the market buying decision in developed regions.
 
If a BMW320 is $120k now, you want to buy toyota corolla at $105k?
Even if you want, most people wont want.
 
What you are seeing now are a lot of people who cant get the BMW even at $120k so they buy a hyundai accent for $95k becos it qualifies them to claim that they are a car owner.
 
Get the drift?

can someone drag the fringe area line to east pasir ris and west tuas and north woodland ... 
 
this is nit smoking pot ... it's happening ... muahahahahaha
 
woodland regional centre ... jurong cbd of the west ... pasir ris got jewel ... not meh?
 

 
bishan 1600psf is not due to location but mainly due to branded architect (official reason)
 
unofficial reason is because someone in capitaland BD was smoking pot and bidded $870 psf for the land (30% higher than 2nd bidder)

Why is MarinaOne asking 2,300-2,000 psf, heard about 40% sold, some abortive sale reported by agents trying to lure some prospect to take over as i was deemed buyer/s lose some deposit money.
 
I think it should't be selling at this psf as the land title was free ( reclaimed land ) S+M are capitalising on the gain and passing the bucks to people who do not realise it.

towards the end of d day, it is the buyer who must do the homework, to buy or not to, I mean look @ the numbers of vacant units still available@ MBS, MBFC and those marketed last 1-2 years, ToP issued yet landlord and agents are loping for tenant, market has shrinker to such an extent that it is the tenant's market now.

whether there is a bubble or whether if the bubble is bursting or had burst or etc etc is a matter of opinion
 
a bubble will only be recognized after it has burst
 
we are fortunate that property info in SG is very transparent compared to most other countries. How many units are constructed, how many unsold, how much is it sold for etc are all available to anyone
 
No excuse for not being able to do your own homework when it comes to buying property (in SG)

Both maps are updated. But both are maps for different purposes.
 
The map somebody else posted depicts the Downtown Core planning area and Orchard planning area. In this map, anything central, but outside of Orchard, Jalan Besar, Bugis and Downtown, was classified as "rest of central area". They excluded completely district 11, majority of district 10, even parts of district 9 like half of River Valley. They included Jalan Besar and Little India in the central area.  This map would be better suited for general urban planning purposes.
 
The map I posted is more of a residential specific map which depicts the CCR, RCR and OCR very clearly.

cant really remember who said what....so long ago. And yes....many things here needs a major reset. Lets hope if it all pan out the contraction wont affect us the commoners. Too many are betting on property price escalating....and that is bad!

Property prices not yet at 'meaningful correction': DPM Tharman
 
28 Oct1:55 PM
 
PROPERTY prices in Singapore have not seen a "meaningful correction" yet, said Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam on Tuesday.
 
 
 
"We've seen some correction in both private property prices and HDB resale prices over the last four to five quarters, but there is some distance to go in achieving a meaningful correction after the sharp run-up in prices in recent years," said the chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore at the Credit Counselling Singapore's 10th anniversary luncheon.
 
 
 
"If we do not get a meaningful reversal after each upswing, property prices will run ahead of the growth in household incomes in the long term. And that, we must avoid."

That depends on the interest rate environment.Plus a bit of unforseeBle black swan event.
The market can absorb a 40% drop for sure especially since it has doubled.
 
The Fed will be stopping QE by year end as announced.
Rate movements are in placed for 2015. They cant keep kicking the can down the road.
 
Infaltion pressures in singapore are already so high and yet we deny.
Everything has gone up 20% - 30% at least in the last 5 yrs.
 
If serious about controlling inflation, strong SGD is not good enough.
Stop external but cannot stop internal.
I hope Tharman will push for a departure of following others and get a grip of our artificially low rates.
