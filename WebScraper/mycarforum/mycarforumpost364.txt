I saw many ads of condo units with tenancy, it may be good to have some rental income during that interval but are there any catch with such arrangements? For example tenant spoil furniture, not willing to move out or what are the major catches one should look out for?

I bought a really old condo with a tenant of about 8 years, pros were the tenant was long term and stayed with me for another 3 years (still ongoing). Cons were the condo was rented furnished so I had to replace any thing that was broken which were air con and washing machine and replaced a sink.
 
As for the things you mentioned tenant not wanting to move out etc that is just heng xuay, but I thought about this also and had a personal chat with the tenant about his situation and also the condition of the apartment what I had to look out for decided he was a good chap and bought the place at a good price too ahem  
 
You might want to get the contacts of the agent that brokered the deal if there was one.

quite rare to find tenants that stayed on for so long
 
to ts, dont view every favourable transaction as having a catch.  sometimes it is just that people have to change plan along the way.  for example, i also sold my unit with 19 months of tenancy to a buyer because i need to change to bigger condo due to more additions to the family.  what's more, my rent is possibly the highest ever recorded for the same size unit in that development.

That's quite an unusual contract.
 
Usually if the tenant breaks anything they have to replace it.

If an agent placed the tenant there (assume 2 yr contract) typically they would act as liaison between tenant and landlord for the first 2 years resolving disputes and what not. From the way I see it if the property is sold with tenancy and the agent brokered the deal and got comms he/she is still obliged to resolve any issues arising between the new landlord and tenant.
 
My tenant had a direct arrangement with the previous landlord so when I took over I was direct liaison (no agent of course).
 
 
If the tenant is already there, why would you contact the agent to contact the tenant again to give him extra money....

- Air Con Breakdown - Replace
- Water heater leak - Replace
- Tabletop broke (see below) - Replace
 

 
The previous landlord must have been quite stingy, anyway we replace all to new items and its been good since. Considering the sofas, bed's, curtain etc etc all more than 10 yrs old and the tenant is fine its actually pretty good. Good fortune for me to buy with this chap renting.

Of course he is nice because you decide to replace everything nicely for him.  Most landlords will ask for minor repair clause to kick in first before they replace.

To be honest I didn't recall what the material was but to be fair that countertop was 15 years old already and installed by the developer (probably on the cheap). Lol I recall when I viewed the unit the agent warned me to be prepared

Most furnishing provided by landlord are cheap (i.e ikea chipboard style) and the furnishing already 8 + years so everything is abit touch and go. Not to mentioned got kids etc anything can happen, usually if can rent out unfurnished is best but since I got this with tenant and furnished just deal the hand I got. 
 
It was a good price anyway, even if I had to replace all the furnishings I would still close the deal

There will be still situation where the are tenants having problems with lease or breaking lease prematurely. Nonetheless it is important to have terms in tenancy to protect landlord's interest like forfeiture of deposit and penalty.

You can’t as the property is not under her name. If have her name then the pay out is according to the % owned. 
2. Risks are too high.

For this, it’s obvious that your wife does not stay there and can’t sublet. If your wife stays there, the subletting amount also has to make sense.
 
This arrangement will only invite yourself to IRAS tea.

Well, you need very hard evidence to prove that it is your wife income especially since she is housewife.
 
IRAS may deem it as tax avoidance.

Actually the full subletting rent amount based on market rate will be declared as wife’s income in her tax filing, with payment all going to her account and staying in her account with full paper trail.   
Iras aside, What I am struggling with is why sublettting of whole unit is not allowed in Singapore, if tenancy agreement permits

If it were so easy, many rich Bros would have bought many more properties and subletted to their many wives! 
I can also rent to my actual tenants for $1 and tell them to pay my mortgage directly.

I have another question regarding subletting and rent. 
 
If the owner of a condo (the family's primary residences) the whole family goes abroad for a few years to as expats, and rent out whole his property, will he be allowed to register his own address and let banks/insurances/CPF posts all his letters to that house? Will IRAS treat that as a sublet and deduct some rental income when calculating rental/property/income taxes?

The short answer is yes. But may have to change IC address to a postal address that one proves that he can receive the mail.

IRAS should consider the whole unit as rented out and not just subletting since no member of the family actually resides there.

It might be good if you would like to gain a monthly income. However, please do not forget to consider the property appreciation side.

Yes, it sounds good to have some passive income during that interval but of course everything comes at a price. I read this article about the things one must know before becoming a landlord. https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/3-things-know-becoming-landlord
 
Of course there are pros and cons in everything and it would be helpful to take note of that.

	just sharing that there is a way to inspect your tenant for a report - get a trusted air con or touch up painting service to get in your home and snap some pics of your place.


	i usually use homepainting.sg for their home painting services.. then they know the routine of going in the place to 'touch-up' paint and check out condition of your condo.


	At the same time i get them to paint just 1 room lah.. very affordable, total only about $200 for the entire room into sparkling enticement mode for tenant.


🙂
