Say someone has a new commercial B2 light industrial unit, TOP soon.  
 
How does one go about looking for tenant?  assuming without agents' involvement?  is it possible for the owner to settle the tenancy?

Bro, it is highly possible for the owner to DIY and save on the agent fees (both for the first engagement and subsequent renewal fees). I have personally done that a few times before. Advertising for tenants in the classifieds had always sufficed for my needs in a reasonably good market.
 
The downside of DIY is that you spend more time "screening" the potential tenants. However that can be considered a plus point since you get to meet the tenants personally before letting them use your unit. Most commercial tenants will renew at market rate once their original contracts expire so there won't be much issue of repeating this search every now and then.
 
Also, if you wish, I can send you a copy of the standard tenancy agreement that I have in Word format so that you can make the necessary adjustments e.g. rental fee, address, etc.
 
Last but not least, remember to ask the tenant to stamp the tenancy agreement with IRAS (they bear the fee).
 
All the best!

There will be penalties that will be imposed by IRAS in the event stamping of the tenancy agreement is not done or is carried out late.

Just stamp it yourself and collect the fee from the tenant.  Anyway, the stamp fee is only 200+ and you can do it online from home comfortably.

Ms Christine Li, director of research at commercial real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield, says: "Retailers from luxury fashion to F&B are currently facing a triple whammy of muted tourism growth, manpower crunch and the growing popularity of e-commerce, which make it harder to start, operate and sustain a business."

Heh thanks but don't think I'll be looking for awhile though market still very frothy. Anyway those matured ones will be hard to find a vacant unit, most businesses there would have bought it long time back to run their biz.
 
Those got pool and what not usually to con investor's, developer would make it swee swee and tell investors can rent for high psf cause got pool can attract professional tenants, IT type businesses cause got lifestyle etc etc. But in reality there are guidelines to who can rent industrial and a number of professional businesses don't qualify. (My own industrial already kanna some tenants getting kicked out, plus I wonder how much these facilities are goonna cost the owners.).
 
A friend's relative developed one such estate, we were discussing why on earth would industrial center have a pool lol. Before we knew it the development was sold out. Joke was on us man 
 
A lot of investors paid too much for industrial and ask for high rental to recoup and no one rents, That said at least Eco-tech is B2 industrial so the tenant pool will be wider, but this pool is usually price sensitive be interesting too see how its gonna work out.

Question from an aspiring investor (probably many years down the road):
 
What's the typical investment quantum for a commercial property and industrial property?
For industrial there are many factors to consider which weigh in to the overall price. Instead of quantum best use psf to gauge, before the boom prices where hovering around the 250 to 350 range for new (60 yrs leasehold) and 200ish range for older units (assume leasehold 40 - 60 years) around 2010 which was reasonable given the rental yield. So for half a buck you would get a property of about 1600 sq feet (proper space no loft concept) 
Adding to that one thing to note is now a days developers build a high ceiling and charge the consumer for "loft" space effectively increasing the shop space which lowers the psf price. Need to consider of that will suit the business you are trying to attract

Great info and very helpful. 
if you can help with these questions 
 
1. What happens when lease expires? Any experience on how much or how they calculate top up?
 
2. Loft building after move in. Does this need approval from building management and authorities? Do we need to buy insurance when we rent it out?
 
3. SME generally looking for what size units?

but i think it will take more than a couple of quarters to see distribution fall
 
due to nature of leases being 3-5 yrs and rental income will not be marked to market
 
REITs also have some room to play with operating expense and deferment of some capital expenditures

He told me about how he bought a commercial property at the basement of somewhere.
I diplomatically smiled and said i wont follow.
 
5 yrs ago i told this same person to buy a landed house to stay if it suits but he didnt want choosing to rent and rent finally buying in early 2014 which was toppish still.
 
 
Conclusion?
Private sector folks got much better insights on these matters compared to civil service guys

Haha thanks but my knowledge is this sector still needs more brushing up.
 
1. What happens when lease expires? Any experience on how much or how they calculate top up?
- No experience in this, but Industrial having such short leases I would imagine govt would have plans to use the space.
 
2. Loft building after move in. Does this need approval from building management and authorities? Do we need to buy insurance when we rent it out?
 
- For my MCST any works (even air con) will need approval (and deposit) before works starts, I don't have a loft unit but I believe you need to engage a engineer (MCST contacts) to certify after the plans are submitted. Can't imagine too much issues if the developer sold it with that concept some might even built units with split levels so owners need not bother.
 
3. SME generally looking for what size units?
 
- This is pretty subjective, it really depends on the type of businesses targeted. Suitable light industry businesses have certain criteria to meet (i.e 70% production or storage, 30% office) so pending on the main activity that dictates the space. For example my current tenant which does car sales about 6/8 people to 1000 sq feet but my other tenant (engineering related) probably doubles that for same space. (btw the percentage I make up one but its about there)

Just to add HDB shop houses are actually great investment, would consider those as opposed to a standard retail shopfront.

Practically 99% empty.
 
Good luck to those investors who bought these units in this mixed development at the peak in 2013.
Already lose until no pants on the high price and yet cant rent out and cant sell.

Shophouses draw keen investor interest
MAY 2, 2016
 
Capital values have risen given scarce supply, growing demand from funds and foreigners
 
 
There is a dichotomy between shophouses that have been upgraded - where investors can enjoy an attractive yield - and older and more dilapidated ones, which do not garner as much interest.
 
The leasing market has softened over the past half year but there is still activity, said a seasoned investor, who recently rented out a Pagoda Street shophouse for over $18,000 a month, or about $12 psf, to a retail tenant in a medical field.
 
"We are seeing quite good leasing demand, especially if you renovate the unit. For tenants, rents are still at a discount compared with a shopping mall or Grade A office space."
 
While the number of shophouse deals fell slightly last year, total value of transactions rose 10 per cent, reflecting sustained interest in this asset class, said Ms Sammi Lim, associate director of investment properties at CBRE.
 
"This year, the pool of serious investors exploring this asset class will widen further with the entry of more boutique institutional funds (looking at) shophouses to add to their entire portfolio."

Shophouses draw keen investor interest
 
Investment property sales activity may be generally quiet but a small corner of the market is still seeing healthy interest. Values of shophouses in the Central Business District (CBD) have jumped over the past two years, buoyed by their scarcity and demand from funds and foreigners.
 
In what is thought to be the priciest deal this year on a per sq ft (psf) basis, a shophouse in Ann Siang Road recently went for SGD10.8 million to a foreign investor, or about SGD3,750 psf in terms of gross floor area (GFA). The owner is believed to be Mr Zain Fancy of Clifton Partners.
 
But although capital values have risen, rents have not increased in tandem, said a property watcher. "Eight years ago, we were seeing 6 per cent rental yields. Today, yields are 3 per cent or even less than that." 
 
This has not stopped some funds and foreigners from aggressively picking up units. Of the 16 CBD shophouse sales with caveats lodged from October 2015, nine were sold to funds or foreigners, a property title check showed. Just in April, investment group 8M Real Estate picked up a Craig Road shophouse for SGD6.5 million. The company also has five shophouses in Amoy Street and another in Gemmill Lane.
 
Transactions completed without caveats early this year included the sale of two shophouses in Pagoda Street to Rio International Investment - one for SGD12.2 million and the other for SGD12 million, or about SGD2,800 psf. The firm is owned by Mr Loi Keong Kuong, owner of Rio Casino in Macau.
 
The newer entrants to this space include Spanish tycoon Ricardo Peralta - chief executive of Luxembourg-based investment holding firm Ventos and a board member of Danone Spain. He has picked up six conservation shophouses from October 2015, the latest believed to be one in Amoy Street which went for SGD20.25 million or about SGD2,411 psf on GFA.
 
“While the number of shophouse deals fell slightly last year, total value of transactions rose 10 per cent, reflecting sustained interest in this asset class. This year, the pool of serious investors exploring this asset class will widen further with the entry of more boutique institutional funds (looking at) shophouses to add to their entire portfolio." said a property consultancy.

Bro, conservation shophouses in such strategic locations are a different class
Just like GCBs
 
Buyer likes
Buyer buys
Money is seldom the key consideration.
 
Its like a rare Rolex or cigar for that matter
I know that if i sell it, i may not be able to buy it back.
I know that if i buy it, i need to find another person who really appreciates it to sell to
Otherwise keep for life. Enjoy
 
People who use such cases to wrongfully misrepresent the general market are either stupid or crooks.

Fund mgmt firms seems to be the main investors for CBD shop houses, relative sold off one at Telok Ayer end last year also to some foreign investment group and got a decent price considering it was smaller than a normal shophouse.

funds pretty aggressive on shophouses... sub 4% also buy
kudos to 8M, managed to grow AUM to 200M within a couple of years 
 
 
 
Stanley Quek companies sell 7 shophouses for SGD81.4m to 8M Real Estate
 
A group of companies controlled by seasoned property investor Stanley Quek is selling seven shophouses for SGD81.4 million to boutique real estate investment company 8M Real Estate.
 
Five of the shophouses are adjoining properties at Nos 15, 17, 19, 21 and 23 Tanjong Pagar Road; they are changing hands for SGD57.4 million. This works out to SGD2,166 per sq ft (psf) on the estimated gross floor area (GFA) of 26,500 sq ft spanning four floors and a mezzanine level. The five shophouses are on 8,902 sq ft of land with about 77.5 years' balance lease. The internal space in the five adjacent properties is contiguous.
 
The other two shophouses that 8M Real Estate is buying from Dr Quek-controlled entities are 18 Gemmill Lane and 71 Neil Road. The Neil Road property, on a site with a balance lease term of 72 years, is being transacted for SGD13 million or SGD1,912 psf based on the GFA of 6,800 sq ft. All three levels and the attic are leased to PMG Group, which is in the integrated marketing communications business.
 
The Gemmill Lane property is being sold for SGD11 million or SGD2,511 psf on GFA of 4,380 sq ft spread over three levels and an attic. The street level space is leased to restaurant Bar A Thym. Level 2 is vacant while Level 3 and the attic are occupied by media group Unruly.
 
8M Real Estate managing director Ashish Manchharam said the acquisition price of the seven shophouses equates to a gross yield of 4.0 per cent on the assumption the portfolio is fully leased. 
 
Inclusive of its purchase of 37 Craig Road for SGD6.5 million last month, 31 Hongkong Street for SGD14.45 million last year as well as its 2014 acquisitions of five shophouses along 112-116 Amoy Street (for SGD50 million), and 22 Gemmill Lane (SGD14.25 million), the total value of the group's 15 shophouses today is about SGD200 million, said Mr Manchharam.

Wealthy manufacturers on the lookout for bargains as industrial property values drop
May 11, 2016
 
Deep-pocketed industrialists are keeping an eye out for relatively inexpensive factory and warehouse space, as values of industrial properties continue to drop.
 
According to Knight Frank, the industrial sector entered 2016 with a hint of optimism despite softer market conditions, with buyers observed to start sourcing and securing good property deals in view of falling prices.
 
 
“Taking advantage of the limited sizeable industrial land sale sites announced by the government for H1 2016, developers could see it as opportune time to clear their unsold strata-titled industrial inventory as future supply of strata-titled industrial spaces could taper over time,” Knight Frank said.
