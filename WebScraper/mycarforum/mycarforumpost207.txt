Appreciate your kind feedback on the pros and cons.

You will get low signal or no signal for your mobile phones
 

Another con is you will wait forever to go down and up via elevators.

Good thing is less people to throw things down and dirty ur windows. Bad part is when you are unlucky enough that all elevators down at the same time. Happened to my block before. Seems like the old elevators are much better. Since they changed the elevators to stop on every floor the elevators seem to break down at least 2-3 times a month. The old ones hardly broke down.

depends on situation, when come to fire, earthquake, etc you will appreciate the low floor, one major bad thing about high floor is when you only have 10sec left before lau sai and your neighbors decide to stop on every floor   [laugh]

Seriously, I was ever in such a situation before in a lift.

What I do is rush into lift and told the other people that I have a bad stomach ache and allow me to go up to my floor first.

Surprisingly nobody touch the lift button after seeing my badly distorted face, hahaha...

Extremely grateful to them

Another thing you need to look out are the doors.
 

The wind on the higher floors can be very strong. It will slam the bedroom door shut if you are not careful and you dun use stoppers..
 

Can be quite "scary" if you have some small children in the house. They may be locked inside or hurt themselves.

Just curious, normally tall HDB blocks have the dubious honour as being the blocks of choice for jumpers.  But so far, never heard of any jumper in the Dawson, Commonwealth, Strathmore area.  I think that's because everyone staying there is damn loaded.

Am staying on the 33rd level.
 

Levels 1 and 2 are covered car parks. Level 3 is open garden, fitness corners, jogging track. 
 

Waiting for lifts: No problems/hassles thus far. 
 

Handphone reception: No problem. 3G also ok. 
 

At night, ... it gets rather cooling, ... to the extend that I only open a small gap (about 3 inches) at 1 (one) window panel, ... and it is sufficient to keep the room cool through the night. Didn't on the fan either. 
 

A tad regret installing air-cons for all rooms and living room. 
 

Oh well, ... wind direction is seasonal, no? Perhaps the air-con will come in handy soon.

I guess staying in high floor, other than cooling, nice view, more quiet and also should be free from roaches or mosquito?! Cause those insects should not able to fly so high? Unless they take the lift up?!    But i cant imagine if there is a power breakdown, how to climb up 40-50 storey???

The sofa is about 2.5m or slightly more in length, thus cannot fit into the lift. 
 

But the width can go thru main door. 
 

Have to pay surcharge like $10 per storey.

Not sure if you would call it a shopping centre.....it's just a building with a food court, a NTUC supermart, a 7-11 and some other small shops such as bakery and hardware shop........
