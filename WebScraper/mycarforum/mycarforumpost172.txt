Does locking one room mean you dun have to stay in the flat?

Flat owner takes HDB to court 

By Romesh Navaratnarajah: In a landmark move, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) has been taken to court after a flat owner filed a case against it for acquiring his flat due to alleged illegal subletting.
 

Chew Teck Fatt, owner of the five-room unit in Bukit Batok, wants the right to be fully heard based on all the evidence gathered.
 

But the HDB feels that the court does not have the power to review its decision and that it can compulsorily acquire a flat that has been illegally rented out.
 

According to facts of the case, HDB acquired Chew's unit after its officers discovered from tenants that he did not actually live there.
 

Chew denied the allegations, explaining that the third room is kept for his own use.
 

He added that several appeals were made to HDB not to acquire his flat but they were denied and resulted in the court action.  
 

In its defence, the housing board said that tenant Zulkeple Husin signed a statement in March this year verifying it to be correct.
 

This is disputed by Zulkeple, who felt the document he signed only attested to the fact that HDB officers visited the flat.
 

At issue now is whether there must be continuous physical occupation of the property or whether Chew lost interest in the flat and illegally sublet the whole unit.
 

Chew also questions how HDB arrived at its decision when it did not give him any opportunity to address the whole issue.
 

He noted that the court action was a last resort, adding that he fully cooperated with HDB and hopes to see the case resolved.

Whatever the truth is, sometimes I like to sue someone suing HDB....Ppl should stand up if they think they are wrongly accused. HDB can be a pain at times... 
 

I have this case, someone from their end tells u something, then another person from similar dept tells u another thing and finally came a 3rd person who said that the due to some reasons unknown....they tell u whatever being said by Person 1 and 2 no count and what they are telling me is final... This is the kind of standard u get...no wonder procurement is a big issue now....

i think it's ony fair that we have a channel (a court or a MP) for us to tell the whole story, before HDB can do anything.  
 

We are not North Korea.  Especially when it comes to a basic need like a shelter home over our heads, we must have the basic right to fight for it, if we are not in the wrong.
 

Govt stat boards cannot suka suka, based on their own analysis, take whatever actions they want.  The person involved need a fair system which he can present whatever facts he wants.  
 

Guess who are the taxpayers who are paying for their salaries and overheads?

gist of the issue is.. he declare to HDB. rent out two room. when actual fact he sublet out whole unit minus the one close door..

you know 1 room 500, 2 room is 1000. iirc 2 bedroom plus living plus kitchen easily 1500 to 1700 now..
 

meaning he is cheating gahmen by 700. plus if you still stay there. the property tax will be 4% if not 10%. 
 

he is in actual fact jumping tax too..

I only know PRs or FRs went further to sublet to cover their rental and earn more money for themselves... 
 

The fact that he did close up one room means the whole unit is not sublet what...nothing wrong... unless HDB clearly states that by closing one room for your own usage  = sublet entire unit. If they didnt spell it out...then many ppl will close one room and sublet the balance. So if u are very clear with your rules then how come ppl tot can close one room and rent the rest? Even agents are telling owners that they can jus close one room and rent out the rest leh... something I heard quite frequently previously unless there are more changes to this...

If they do like wat u say...it is not call punishment liao..the fact that they acquired it back is to punish him..but whether there is sufficient evidence...must see how the case develop...Landmark case...once precedent set...ppl who has the money can sue HDB if they suka suka acquire...they must make sure their rules are concised before they slap such punitive sentence on others...

if it is traded in a free market, then nothing to be fair or not fair. But for a regulated market, especially when people couldn't get one yet someone else can rent and not stay in it, i guess it is the public that are red eye about it. nothing to do with poor or rich lah.

if kena posted overseas, then rent out whole house, 

i believe such situations can apply from HDB to be allowed for rental.
 
 

how many of you heard of, 

married stay with parents, HDB rent out to pay installment.

KNN  !@#!$ not that i am directly implicated....

but that really one reason why people are dying to buy HDB.

He didn't lose the flat without compensation.
 

It was acquired by HDB, meaning he did not make losses, just that he probably made less gains than he would on the open market.

married stay with parents, HDB rent out to pay installment.

KNN  !@#!$ not that i am directly implicated....

but that really one reason why people are dying to buy HDB.



 

i share your view and that's why i think HDB also blame-able although the mr chew is worse.
 

mr chew for trying to exploit loopholes and even though kena penalised for it, still want to take legal action.
 

hdb for their not so logical rules and very lax and sporadic enforcements.

If rent out 1 or 2 rooms dun have to declare HDB but sublet the whole unit will need to declare.



 

yes 

because rental income is taxable
 

i think by not declaring = infringe HDB rules and income tax laws

Those married and stay with parents type i guess they can give excuse like easier for parents to look after their kids. And in any case i not sure how many married couples actually WANT to stay with parents....more often then not will start quarreling....



 

part 1, 

i think HDB flats still need to conform to hdb rulings.

like ethnics ratio 

cannot sell to foreigner

benefits ? er... Town council clean the common area? am not sure liao
 

part 2

money is the major cause of conflict

so if rent out, got $$

then won't quarrel so much la*

if it is traded in a free market, then nothing to be fair or not fair. But for a regulated market, especially when people couldn't get one yet someone else can rent and not stay in it, i guess it is the public that are red eye about it. nothing to do with poor or rich lah.

5 There also have been cases of flat owners who try to circumvent HDB’s rules by locking up one room and subletting the rest of the flat without physically staying in the flat. Such cases will be treated as unauthorized subletting of flats if home owners did not meet the minimum occupation period and did not seek HDB's approval to sublet their flats.
 

quite clear lah.. from HDB website.
 

anyway, whatever excuse he gives be it stay near parents look after children etc, main point is he DOES NOT need the house and is contributing to the shortage of houses here and driving up rental and resale prices.

Imagine the parents will start wanting a share of the rental collected from the other unit since by allowing the married couple to stay in their flat allowed them to earn that extra cash in the first place. Even if they pay their parents, say $700 for the room that they staying but they collecting $2k from the flat they renting out so they still "make" $1,300....the parents might want part of that too....

Where got so easy to sue HDB! They have enough proof and so took action to repossess the flat. 

That time some PR didn't declare their overseas property when buying HDB flats, thinking HDB has no way to check... but they were all wrong! 
 
 

If want to rent out flat, can apply for permit. Why need to lock one room? Scare IRAS tax huh?

HDB flats are meant for owner-occupation. Flat owners who wish to sublet their flat must fulfill the Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) for subletting. They must also obtain HDB's approval to sublet the flat. They can submit the application online at www.hdb.gov.sg/subletting.
 

Unauthorised subletting of flat is an infringement of the lease. HDB takes a serious view of such infringement and will not hesitate to take strong action against those who flout the rules. Unauthorised subletting of flat includes instances where owners sublet one or more bedrooms while they do not live in the flat during the period of subletting. Instead, they keep one room locked and come back only occasionally. HDB can repossess the flat of those who commit such infringements. In lieu of this action, HDB may impose a penalty against them.

Enforcement Action By HDB
 
 

HDB carries out targeted investigations on suspected cases of unauthorised subletting. If the infringement of unauthorised subletting is established, action will be taken against the flat owners concerned. In 2011, HDB took action against 56 flat owners who committed the infringement. The action includes imposition of a penalty and repossession of flats. 
 

Provide Feedback on Unauthorised Subletting of Flat
 

To help prevent abuse of public housing, residents are encouraged to call our Toll-Free Hotline No. 1800-5556370 to provide feedback on any suspected cases of unauthorised subletting of flat. The Hotline is available Mondays to Fridays, 8am to 5pm. Residents can be assured that any information provided will be treated with the strictest confidence.

I read the bold and I wonder if the update was in any part carry out after the incident. If so, then it will not be right. It is HDB's responsibility to convey all its terms and conditions for subletting when giving their approval and for the owner to look at the terms and conditions. It cannot suka suka change the terms and expect owners to read up their website constantly... This one good show lah...

is it? oh i thought he evicted. as the case against him as illegal sublet is not weak. everyone knows about the locked room loophole.



 

That's the misconception most people have about the compulsory acquisition of flats which are illegally let out.
 

Most people think it is "cheong kong" or confiscated, but it is actually acquired according to perceived market value by HDB, that is why every now and then you see on HDB they have got small pockets of flats to sell.
 

If I am not wrong, some are because of this compulsory acquisition, some are folks who passed away with no kin etc...

that's why i say, instead of allowing people to sublet out or rent out whole flat, hdb should just go back to the basics  and take out all these provision for leesees to make money.  then the objective hdb flat is meant for affordable housing for masses can be achieved.
 

once you allow people to make money out of hdb flat, the rental yield will justify their paying high price for it.

I only know PRs or FRs went further to sublet to cover their rental and earn more money for themselves... 
 

The fact that he did close up one room means the whole unit is not sublet what...nothing wrong... unless HDB clearly states that by closing one room for your own usage  = sublet entire unit. If they didnt spell it out...then many ppl will close one room and sublet the balance. So if u are very clear with your rules then how come ppl tot can close one room and rent the rest? Even agents are telling owners that they can jus close one room and rent out the rest leh... something I heard quite frequently previously unless there are more changes to this...




its called, trying to cheat the system.

He didn't lose the flat without compensation.
 

It was acquired by HDB, meaning he did not make losses, just that he probably made less gains than he would on the open market.



 

It happened before. Normally, HDB take back the flat at around 90% of the valuation.

Lock one room for own use does not mean the person has to be physically there always mah...can stay there once a while...and then use that as a temporary storage space or office oso can mah...



 

http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10323p.nsf/w/...om?OpenDocument 
 

It is clearly stated in the above website under T&C that "Owners and all the authorised occupants must at all times be in continuous physical occupation of the flat."

Keywords: continuous physical occupation.

once in a while not equal continuous.temporary storage space not equal physical occupation.

Even if rent out one room and lock 2 other rooms, lock kitchen, lock 2 toilets, lock dinning room, lock living room, lock store room.... whatever room all lock, if owner does not stay there, then this condition is not met.

Orbi good for this guy...
 

And yes...in some ways HDB is the law in this aspect..it is wha we call a statutory tribunal, able to make and dispense decisions within its jurisdiction.  This suggests that while the Courts may open the case, it may rule only on errors of law or of fact made by HDB, specifically the incorrect application of the Housing Board Act, Regulations. But since as many bros have pointed out, HDB has repeatedly made public its meaning of continuous occupation on its website and in the press already, I hope this guy has little chance of appealing.

Use curtain to create a room to rent out for 450$ per month.  I did the complain because the owner chase me out 1week early because I've committed something that againts her tenant rule, what i've done is SLEEP on sofa, the reason i sleep in sofa because roommate snore too loud and im unable to sleep, i force to sleep on sofa because i got work next day.
 

I suppose to move out this friday and getting my deposit soon, but House owner take my personal details and question me HBD coming house to inspect this few days.
 

Im frustrated ( because i am the one who sent complain, yet I'll refuse to answer questions against this matter).
 

My question is, will HDB inspector simply reveal my name? or they will keep this as top P&C.

Bottomline what is HDb for?..!!?!!!?

For these bloody a-----es to make profit?

Or to provide affordable accomodation for the people?
 

HDB should confiscate more units. 

KNN still want to sue HDB.
 

The simple rule should be, unless overseas on holiday or temporary, this owner of HDB must be slepping in the HDB.

Otherwise will be considered illegally renting whole unit.

Simple as that.

My neighbour rent out all the room coss he is a PRC now living in HK (i never get to see him for past 13 years!).
 

the living room and kitchen is like a garage where the tenants throw their unwanted stuff when they leave, so it accumulate after they change tenant like every quarter PER room   <_<

I just complain about my HDB owner that she :
 

Use curtain to create a room to rent out for 450$ per month.  I did the complain because the owner chase me out 1week early because I've committed something that againts her tenant rule, what i've done is SLEEP on sofa, the reason i sleep in sofa because roommate snore too loud and im unable to sleep, i force to sleep on sofa because i got work next day.
 

I suppose to move out this friday and getting my deposit soon, but House owner take my personal details and question me HBD coming house to inspect this few days.
 

Im frustrated ( because i am the one who sent complain, yet I'll refuse to answer questions against this matter).
 

My question is, will HDB inspector simply reveal my name? or they will keep this as top P&C.

thanks helping me out!

Er.... you did break one of the terms of the contract first.  Why complain directly to hdb and not discuss first with the landlord? She might provide you with very good earsnuff to block out the snores of the other tenant or suggest you try snoring louder?
 

Pardon the light humor,  no offence meant.  Just collect back your deposit and look for another place to rent. And if you are easily awakened,  suggest that you ask landlord whether the rental can include the sofa in case kena same snoring situation ya.
 

Er.... hope you resolve your problem and have better rest too.

I did the right move. She told me to move out 1week ( actually is 10 days) because me initially break the rule. And Yes I admitted it my fault and I agree to move out on the date she assigned.  I did wrong, And I move out 10 days early, She earn 120SGD from there, its fair, this situation I think is fair enough isnt?

FYI, I already found a room, which i've chosen to stay in a room alone. 

The problem is that I been asking HDB officer by asking so whether is it legal for house owner to use curtain to create a room for rent ( Im new to singapore, Im not local, thats why im asking so ). 

Then suddenly owner told me HDB officer will come to inspect the house, therefore she quickly take my details and key into the website.  
 

Im not sure the HDB will simply reveal my name to owner？ or they will keep as Top P&C.

KNN.
 

Bottomline what is HDb for?..!!?!!!?

For these bloody a-----es to make profit?

Or to provide affordable accomodation for the people?
 

HDB should confiscate more units. 

KNN still want to sue HDB.
 

The simple rule should be, unless overseas on holiday or temporary, this owner of HDB must be slepping in the HDB.

Otherwise will be considered illegally renting whole unit.

Simple as that. 
 

Fu(king bloody a-----e scumbag.



 

Don't be so hard on them bro. Yes, they're profiteering, but remember that the first and biggest profiteers are the gahmen. I'm sure Marlboro Man is still laughing about the prices that HDB flats are being sold for, considering what they cost him to build. Surely, the MIW cannot be the only ones who deserve a piece of the pie, right? 
 

So - before you condemn them, remember - they're only trying to follow their masters. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Muahaha.

I disagree.
 

Instead of the HDB standing there on that piece of land, providing affordable housing for the people, the Govt can bloody well sell that piece of land to private developers and the resulting 1,000 sq ft apartment will cost $2m.
 

OK?
 

So it is subsidised.

You can call it subsidized going by your logic.
 

Subsidized housing land price, however, should never be compared to private sector land price. Else don't call it subsidized if you wanna whine over lost opportunity cost. OK?

You did nothing wrong other than to sleep on the sofa and breaking the agreement. You could have used earplugs, and then let your roommate or owner know about the problem the next day.
 

The owner, in my opinion, sounds like an a-hole: One small mistake ask people to move, rent out flat but don't stay there, lose flat want to sue HDB. I hope the court make her pay even more for wasting tax payer's money.
 

What do you mean will HDB reveal your name to owner? Issit you don't want the owner to know that it is you that call HDB? By posting here the whole Singapore knows already lah!!

The concept of providing subsidized housing means they must discount the opportunity cost for land price. Else don't call it subsidized housing. OK?




What the hell are you talking about - discount opportunity cost?  Opportunity cost is a very real cost to the government, given the investment environment in the last 20 years.  Why didn't the MND plan subsidised public housing to be built in Raffles Place, Marina Bay, Sentosa and Orchard Road. How about a sea-facing Meyer Road HDB?  Just sell the bleeding thing for $800 psf and Govt subsidise $2,200 psf.
 

The definition of subsidy:
 

: a grant or gift of money: as

a : a sum of money formerly granted by the British Parliament to the crown and raised by special taxation

b : money granted by one state to another

c : a grant by a government to a private person or company to assist an enterprise deemed advantageous to the public 
 
 

Mission Statement of the HDB
 

We provide affordable homes of quality and value.

We create vibrant and sustainable towns.

We promote the building of active and cohesive communities.

We inspire and enable all staff to give of their best.
 
 

Where does it say that subsidised public housing must discount opportunity cost?  Give subsidy to cushion the impact of the full market price is already very good liao.

Why not? Give me a reason.
 

If you don't have a yardstick to compare with, how do you know one is cheaper than the other?  Cheaper by how much?
 

$150k for a 1,000 sq ft HDB as you had suggested, is cheap.
 

Well it is not cheap if you are coming from say, Michigan, or Western Australia.
 

So how cheap do you wanna go now?  What are you comparing to, that is not so cheap?
 

What a dumbfark statement!  I had expected better from you Porker.

That's precisely because the locations you quoted are so valuable that they don't want to use it for HDB! Don't quote ridiculous examples and go off tangent ok?
 

HDB is supposed to be backwater/suburban. When land prices of such locations go up then they jolly well try and cushion as much as they can and not use it as an excuse or reason to increase public housing prices to levels so ridiculous they bother on private home prices. Nice work comparing subsidized/public housing to private market movement.
 

Do we need the government to spoon feed us and tell us the meaning of subsidized?

Land in Singapore has always been valued using Raffles Place land as the benchmark.
 

Every square metre of land in any part of Singapore has the potential to be Raffles Place.
 

This is even truer now - just look at Jurong East and Paya Lebar which are shaping up very nicely.

I know you can afford a HDB without problem. Many here probably do. But think about the ramifications of them comparing HDB land price to private sector land price and then justify the increase in HDB price to ridiculous levels.

No it is not obvious. Give me a reason why HDB land price should never be compared to private sector land.
 

Is the soil different?  Or is the sky above different?  The water is different?  Ah, i know, the grass is different.
 

I bought in overseas properties because you ventured put a $ amount to the ideal HDB price and claimed that is truly "affordable".
 

Affordable relative to who? To what?  Surely there must be a benchmark!

can residents sue government or kopitam for higher kopi price?
 
 
 
 

HDB coffee shops are not District 10 bungalows
 

They were built by the HDB to serve residents on state land acquired for a public purpose
 

Think | Updated By Han Fook Kwang, Managing Editor
 

Here's a $23.8 million question about Singapore's most expensive coffee shop, in Hougang: How come I can still buy a cup of kopi-o there for 90 cents?
 

The simple answer is that, disregarding the price of the property, what goes into making that cup of coffee didn't cost much -especially not the wages of coffee shop assistants.
 

They are likely to belong to the bottom 20 per cent of income earners, whose incomes have stagnated over the years.
 

Mean-spirited though it might be, it's their meagre earnings you have to thank for your cheap beverage.
 

If they were paid more, like workers in Japan or Switzerland, for example, you can bet your last teh kosong that you will have to pay a lot more.
 

That 90-cent coffee represents one part of Singapore, perhaps the part that many of us are fond of even if we would rather not have our livelihood depend on it.
 

The $23 million Housing Board coffee shop, however, is another story altogether and might as well belong to a different world.
 

What goes into making up the sky-high price and how did it reach such a level?
 

When The Straits Times spoke to people in the property business last week, they cited one possible reason: the prospect of capital appreciation of the shop, which means it might sell for an even higher price in future.
 

If those experts are right, the buyer was prepared to pay the record price not because it made business sense in the running of a coffee shop, but because it was a good property buy which he could hope to profit from at some later date.
 

Stallholders in the shop were quoted as being understandably concerned that the new owner might raise rents. Patrons were in turn worried about having to pay more for food and drinks.
 

Alas, the two worlds do collide, and when a $23m deal spills over to a 90 cents cup of coffee, you know what the outcome is likely to be.
 

But should the price of a cup of coffee be tied to the ups and downs of the property market?
 

Can't Singaporeans have their kopi without worrying about the next multimillion-dollar deal?
 

The reality is that in this land- scarce, market-driven country, almost everything is affected by the high price of land and property.
 

It's a lament I often hear from Singaporean bosses complaining about the cost of doing business here, especially rental cost.
 

A friend who runs an SME says he regrets selling a building he developed for a tidy profit and renting back some of the floors for his own operation.
 

His rent has gone up considerably over the years, and the profit he made from the sale has not been enough to cover the rising rent. He did not foresee industrial rentals increasing so much and says he knows others with similar stories.
 

For residential property, rising prices have led the Government to impose no fewer than eight sets of cooling measures since 2009 with only limited success.
 

It shows how difficult it is to tackle the problem once a property bubble builds up.
 

In a normally functioning market, the price of a coffee shop property cannot be so high that it would be impossible for the buyer to recoup his outlay from operating the shop.
 

If Singaporeans are only willing to pay 90 cents for a cup of coffee, it places a limit on how much that coffee shop itself is worth.
 

But if the shop is viewed more as a property buy and less as a place to sell food and drinks, its price will have more to do with the state of the property market than the price of a cup of coffee.
 

Eventually, though, that coffee price will have to go up, as is likely to be the case in that $23 million shop.
 

This is the same worry many people have over the setting up of real estate investment trusts (Reits) which critics say exert pressure on rentals because of the financial returns these instruments are expected to provide for investors.
 

They have been blamed for ever rising rentals of retail shops in the malls and industrial property.
 

Should the Government intervene to stop these price increases?
 

Or are they the result of market forces and best left unregulated?
 

The trouble is that, contrary to popular belief, the price of land, and hence property, is not decided solely by free market forces here.
 

In fact, it is mostly determined by the Government because it is the largest landlord and has control over many policies that affect selling prices: how much land it releases for development, the period of the leases it offers, the zoning parameters it draws up, the actual prices of public flats it builds, the restriction on property loans it can impose and so on.
 

With so much control at its disposal, the Government has a primary responsibility to ensure that prices and rentals do not get out of hand.
 

Indeed, it recognises and accepts this, which was why it intervened with all those cooling measures.
 

But it has to be clearer about what exactly is its overall policy regarding these prices.
 

It isn't at the moment, and this explains why it dithered in the past and did not act as decisively as it should have when prices moved so precipitously.
 

It has been only recently that it has taken a clearer position on, for example, public flats.
 

Earlier this year, National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan said that when pricing new flats, the HDB would set prices on its own instead of pegging them to resale flat prices.
 

"We should be the price-setter, not be the price-follower... The social objective is to ensure home ownership and affordability," he said.
 

In practical terms, it meant pricing new flats in non-mature estates at four times the annual median income of applicants, 30 per cent lower than the current 5.5 times.
 

That's a good start to making it clearer, more transparent and affordable.
 

What about coffee shops?
 

For those in housing estates, such as the one in Hougang, there is no reason why they should be bought and sold like bungalows in District 10. They were built by the HDB to serve residents on state land acquired for a public purpose.
 

If the price of coffee has to go up eventually, Singaporeans would rather the increase went to those shop assistants and stall holders rather than property players out to make a financial killing.
 

One simple way to ensure these shops keep to their original objective is to require that they be sold back only to the HDB.
 

It would put a lid on spiralling prices.
 

And keep that cup of kopi-o within everyone's reach.

I disagree.
 

Instead of the HDB standing there on that piece of land, providing affordable housing for the people, the Govt can bloody well sell that piece of land to private developers and the resulting 1,000 sq ft apartment will cost $2m.
 

OK?
 

So it is subsidised.



 
 

But then many Sporeans wil not b able to afford a place to stay n the next election u cannot see the lightning anymore.

You can call it subsidized going by your logic.
 

Subsidized housing land price, however, should never be compared to private sector land price. Else don't call it subsidized if you wanna whine over lost opportunity cost. OK?



 
 

The URA sells the land to HDB at very low price but HDB wil cost the land at same price of the most ex land in SG (Eg: Shenton Way/Orchard etc) when ty do their costing to calculate the subsidy.
 

Is this fair? :angry:

You did nothing wrong other than to sleep on the sofa and breaking the agreement. You could have used earplugs, and then let your roommate or owner know about the problem the next day.
 

The owner, in my opinion, sounds like an a-hole: One small mistake ask people to move, rent out flat but don't stay there, lose flat want to sue HDB. I hope the court make her pay even more for wasting tax payer's money.
 

What do you mean will HDB reveal your name to owner? Issit you don't want the owner to know that it is you that call HDB? By posting here the whole Singapore knows already lah!!



 
 

I think theres more than what we read here.
 

Maybe this tenent has been giving the landlord many problems with his lawyer burok attitude n the landlord take this small breach of contract to evict the tenant?

Why not? Give me a reason.
 

If you don't have a yardstick to compare with, how do you know one is cheaper than the other?  Cheaper by how much?
 

$150k for a 1,000 sq ft HDB as you had suggested, is cheap.
 

Well it is not cheap if you are coming from say, Michigan, or Western Australia.
 

So how cheap do you wanna go now?  What are you comparing to, that is not so cheap?
 

What a dumbfark statement!  I had expected better from you Porker.



 
 

But HDB cost the land ty build on same as land price at Raffles Place etc which is the MOST EXPENSIVE land in SG even though the HDB flat is in Marsling, Bukit Batok etc.
 

Why is the land cost being calculated like this? Ty sud base the land cost the same as where the actual flats r built. I think this is very unfair.

Land in Singapore has always been valued using Raffles Place land as the benchmark.
 

Every square metre of land in any part of Singapore has the potential to be Raffles Place.
 

This is even truer now - just look at Jurong East and Paya Lebar which are shaping up very nicely.

However, how they price their BTO HDB flat should not be peg to land price or private pricing. it should always be peg to ITE Grad for the cheapest unit.

Maybe my morality is wrong but that's the way the govt costed and priced the HDB land so who am I to say otherwise?
 

Anyway there are no prizes to be won here. The prizes to be won are out there in the real property market, which is controlled by the govt.
 

"Should" and "should be" are moot here, the right way is the govt's way.

"Has the potential to be" isn't quite the same as "currently is".
 

Your statement is so childish, it's like saying since you think property market will crash, why not sell all your property and wait for crash, or if you think property market will go up, sell everything, beg steal borrow to buy property.
 

I am just trying to explain the govt's method of accounting, costing and pricing HDB land.  They have to take the benchmark from somewhere, as Singapore is much too small to have separate regional benchmarks for govt's accounting purposes.
 

You're stubborn too as you refuse to see the govt's point.  You had kopi with Chee Soon Juan recently is it?

Simple.
 

I won't buy now because I don't know when it will achieve its full potential, it could be 200 years or 500.  In the meantime there are better places to buy with a shorter time frame for capital appreciation.  The govt however is not into short term investing - they are planning 50 to 100 years ahead.

Not every square metre has the potential to be as valuable as Raffles Place by virtue of location and cost effectiveness.
 

Lim Chu Kang cannot be a Raffles Place. Because it has no transport network as well developed (relatively) as Raffles Place. We can spend tons of money to develop that place and level all the hills to make it work - not cost effective.
 

Raffles Place, on the other hand, has drawbacks of soft soil condition near Singapore river bank. Lim Chu Kang probably don't have that problem.
 

Even land parcels in Raffles Place are priced differently contrary to your argument that its difficult to segregate land price in an area as small as Singapore (and of course Raffles Place). Don't have to go into specifics.
 

So not all locations are created equal.

If die die have to put a price above zero then it should be heavily discounted from comparable. Not equal to comparable.
 

You price it equal to comparable and you're effectively placing it together with private apartments. Don't masquerade as AFFORDABLE housing if doing so because it sure ain't affordable to many.

zero is best... cheap houses everywhere
 

but just curious on the not affordable part..... because at last glance... demand still outstrip supply....
 

so case in point is how to determine affordable?
 

dictionary states affordable is considered to be within one's financial means.
 

would it be safe to say, as long as your CPF can pay for the HDB (without topping up cash every month), then it is affordable?

The term affordable is wide casting so using a benchmark will screw some over and make others happy. Very difficult to draw a balance. I will venture out to say that they should make it flexible. But that will mean the apartment can only be sold back to HDB at the same price they paid for. Does this arrangement cover the issue of affordability and yet not allow people to profit handsomely? I believe it does.

it it was implemented at onset, then yes good idea.... if implemented now, some will get screwed and some will be happy......
 

with 90% of households staying in hdb, the repercussions is great.....
 

if applied all across the board, the current owners will be unhappy, if applied for new owners, new owners not happy. then there is the issue of EC and so on and so forth...
 

my grouse is in fact the valuation done.... most will just take the last transcated price and +/- abit.... this i feel is what really cause HDB prices to shoot up...

Not really since HDB will take the units back at the prices the owners paid for. They will get screwed instead  Because HDB flats should never have been subjected to open market price fluctuations in the first place.

Good article there. I've said it to Vic and I'll say it again.
