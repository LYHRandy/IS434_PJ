Quote from The Business Times:
"For the first time in nearly a decade, the median cash-over-valuation (COV) for resale public flats hit zero-ground last month as resale and rental volumes weakened, flash estimates show."
 
right timing, am going to buy resale this year.
 
Question: will the COV be -ve, i mean the flat selling at valuation minus?

Got ah, people calling it CUV.
 
Never see news puggol/sengkang (I forget which one, all the same to me) got people sell 50k under valuation? Latest rumour is another one in same area sold even lagi under valuation.
 
People still make lah, compared to how much they bought for. Asset appreciation huat ah.
 
Tiagong with all the TOPs coming up, people gonna slash asking price even more cos new place coming and need to sell off quick.
 
Hopefully this trend will start being reflected in valuations and BTO pricing eventually.

Are you asking for COV, asking for valuation amount or asking below valuation?

Only 3 months lo, you think you can sell immediate once you advertised?!   Unless after more than 6 months or more cannot sell, then you start to worry.
 
Anyway, flat cannot sell can due to many reasons la. Even location is near MRT, buyer also must see the condition of the house, which floor,the neighbours next door and how much cov you asking etc.

Currently if you are talking about fantastic location, they are still commanding around 30k ~ 50k COV. Bishan are not commanding that high as of now. Main reason being not alot of chinese wanna sell and those selling are all of lower floor, and farther away from MRT.

the 3 yr quarantine period slapped on new PRs has quite a significant impact on the current situation.

If tomorrow someone bought a unit beside yours at a lower price without cov, will you still find it that worthwhile?

actually i don mind staying Yishun or Sembawang.
but recently saw few 3rooms postings at Whampao, TPY area selling <300k, not bad, a good buy. close to office also.
 
so am really hoping it will drop further n near zero COV.
bcos the estimated reno + furniture + electrical applicances cost come close to 30k already. bare minimum n tempted to folk out more for reno so tat it looks like those featured house, stylish.
 
for those 4-5 rooms, i guess min 80k, no wonder there is this reno loan package offered by banks.
 
saw those featured home reno, damn beautiful, i think at least 100k. somemore at nice location, COV 20-50k.
wah - move in cost 150k. i cry...

your asking realistic or not?
 
if in hurry to sell, i would suggest selling at 20K below other sellers. Sure sell.. better than waiting and suffering a drop of more than $20K in a few months

From signing on the dot till shift in takes an average of 5 months. 5 mths ago, still can fetch such a price, now it's alittle hard when there are too many houses out there. Unless it's like the person ba zi super match the block and unit number to let him strike ang bao toto, else it's really hard to go near to that amount.

Hoohoo, I think you've just shown that you don't own a HDB. COV can be paid with CPF?

 
If average is zero, and your neighbour paid $100K COV, then somebody must have paid $100k BELOW COV! 
 
 

 
Um, could have been 2 people paying -50k. Or 3 people paying -33k. You get the idea.

Valuation is bulls**t. Otherwise why would there have an average COV of +50k before this?
 
Valuation methods were too conservative then. COV of 0 could also mean that valuers are finally doing their job properly.
 
You sell/buy at what the market will bear, not what some clown tells you your flat is worth.

Asking can also be 1 mil COV if the seller is not serious.
 
Viewed a jumbo in the Holland area last year. Asking COV was almost 200k - not sure if it was sold eventually an at what price. Maybe I'll check later.

I once thought of cov for getting property 5 mins from mrt.............like 40% downpayment for a car...
 
I think its more for the convenience for the children la. I also got a flat near MRT station cuz of my children. They can't drive till they are 18 ma. If far from MRT station still need to fetch them to school or use the school bus.
 
Even if the family no car the, COV is only one time and you can live there for more than 10 years. Car only 10 years and got to pay another lump sum after COE expires and still got other costs of owning a car.

COV just indicates whether pricing is on uptrend and the COV amount represents the lag between valuation and actual market price. Zero COV means valuations have finally caught up to what the market is willing to pay. There will still be flats that command that COV and there will be flats that go below COV. There's so many social factors to consider (people needing to downgrade, instead of fishing for a wad of cash). With the slew of flats coming online, it is little surprise that the COV numbers are coming down.

Hoohoo, I think you've just shown that you don't own a HDB. COV can be paid with CPF?

 
Um, could have been 2 people paying -50k. Or 3 people paying -33k. You get the idea.

 
Valuation is bulls**t. Otherwise why would there have an average COV of +50k before this?
 
Valuation methods were too conservative then. COV of 0 could also mean that valuers are finally doing their job properly.
 
You sell/buy at what the market will bear, not what some clown tells you your flat is worth.

 
Asking can also be 1 mil COV if the seller is not serious.
 
Viewed a jumbo in the Holland area last year. Asking COV was almost 200k - not sure if it was sold eventually an at what price. Maybe I'll check later.

HDB lah. Just that when the 30-40k is "business as usual" I was staying with my outlaws. Eventually got a low floor unit with minimal cov relative to that year.  It was a fairly long wait till I got my resale.

i really dunno how this is gonna pan out...
sellers won't want to sell too low...
buyers won't agree to too high prices..
how long can buyers & sellers like me wait??

the trick of the game is to see who blink first

the zero cov  doesn't apply to  all hdb  flats hor.
 
 those rare ones like EM or jumbo or masionettes  still command a  high cov because they are rare.  no  new  ones at all. always got buyer demand.  
 
places like bishan, TPY, kovan, clementi are still commanding high cov.
 
it is only those normal run of the mill flats like 3 or 4 room flats in ulu estate that have to be sold -ve COV.
 
in bad times, we are able to see the true worth of your flat.

heh,
my asking is wat is stated on the valuation report. 
why wud i wanna undermine the professional assessor appointed by HDB to put the monetary value on my flat?? 
if there is a buyer who is willing to buy & add in a few more gran to the price as he/she deems worthy...why wud i not wanna accept it? 
willng buyer....willing seller...fair deal innit?! 

 don't hold the valuation report as a gospel bible.  valuation report only an indicator. they calculate based on past prices. they dont factor in future market trends

oh ya hor...
MRT always breakdown, service disruption...slower than usual...it shud be a minus point then.  

at this moment and the coming near future, MRT is no longer a selling point of a property.  Garment already expanding the MRT network to almost everywhere.  Rem what they say?  they promise every household will have access to train within 10 mins walking distance.

yeah...the price is indicative...both parties can always negotiate from there.
how much far off or near to the valuation numbers is what it is.

Those folks who work in the credit dept of a bank will know how meaningful a valuation is.
 
When i sold one of my properties in 2007, they relied on my selling price as valuation.
So its all about the credit sentiment.  If credit sentiment and internal policy is for loans, valuation can be 20% higher no prob.

bank valuations exacerbate both boom and bust.
 
When the banks need higher valuations, they know which valuation companies to turn to..
 
when the market is looking bad in 2009, i remembered a local bank valued a FH shophouse in D9 at just $600 psf when the asking was $1,500 psf

At the end of the day, HDB not scared lah..... Its a "protected" segment.
 
I mean how many HDBs are we allowed to buy, right?
 
Speculative forces are minimal compared to private market.
 
Just keep it clean and neat, connect with the community, stay happy, enjoy the subsidies.   At the end of 99yrs, ashes to ashes .  
 
Life is too short and already complicated enough.
 
Its so sad that people are "forced" to do all sorts of funny things to get ahead.
 Everything is like a gamble, buy HDb also gamble, buy Car also gamble, go primary school also like a gamble.

1. i'm skeptical about MBT's intention when he first introduced the scheme. Who is he trying to benefit?
 
2. allowing developers to bid for the land = all profits are fully creamed off. Nothing left for the buyers. KBW woke up when tampines DBSS went up to $900K. His lieutenants obviously did not warn him earlier when Sim Lian bidded $261 psf for the land. Too happy collecting the money.
 
3. i might be wrong, but DBSS to me is still HDB. After 5 years MOP, i would ask what is the difference between the DBSS and the next door BTO? Bettter design? Unlikely, judging from some of the latest BTOs i have seen. Better fittings? Yes, but are they worth $100-200K premium? or just $20K? Any swimming pool? Clubhouse? Security guard? Nope.
 
In other words, these buyers have bought a HDB flat without the chance to bite at the cherry cos they have given up their subsidy to the developers. 
 
forgot to add: by creating a new sub-market between HDB and EC, they are causing further housing price inflation as each sub-market commands its own price levels.
 
Thank You MBT!

It's not about being forced lah, it's just what I can the Singapore condition (much like the human condition).
 
So many people seem to have this property fever. Their minds are constantly working to find ways and means of using the system, particularly the public housing system, to their advantage (and trying to sound like experts in the process).
 
When I was looking for my little pigeonhole HDB last year, I had a rough budget on how much I was willing to spend/locations I would consider/size of flat and why I was buying a place.
 
I got all kinds of "advice" on how to "maximise my investment" and these were from acquaintances, not my property agent.

I think the biggest "draw" was the chance to have the house renovated using CPF money - the place could be delivered in "move in condition" and it was paid for out of CPF...
 
As opposed to "normal" HDB where you still had to pay for reno - 
 
But of course, 5 years later, there is no difference between a DBSS and a BTO that has been renovated - so they are (relatively) less profit.  But people still dream and think that they are worth a premium now.

i think the first batch could possibly fetch $30 to $50K premium over same place resale flats that are relatively new, for now.
 
This premium should reduce as time goes by.
 
And based on the current direction of HDB  price, the next batch that finishes the MOP will most likely see zero premium

Cash-over-valuation (COV) figures will no longer be part of the negotiating process for Housing Board resale deals, as buyers and sellers will now have to agree upon a price first before getting an official valuation, National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan said in Parliament on Monday.
 
Previously, sellers usually got valuations first, and then negotiated with buyers over how much more - or less - should be paid. But negotiations should "rightly" be based on recent transaction prices, not the additional cash premium or COV, said Mr Khaw.
 
So from 5 pm on Monday, a price must first be agreed upon and the Option to Purchase (OTP) granted, before buyers can request a valuation from the HDB. HDB will no longer give valuations to sellers, although existing OTPs and valuations will still be honoured until their expiry.
 
This move will "restore the original intention of valuation, which is to help buyers get a housing loan," said Mr Khaw.

COV served as a pseudo ceiling as it could be be financed, and now that it is lifted, and full financing onboard, expect HDB prices to move upwards!
 
seriously.. who are these scholars who write such policies?? Are they all fresh grads from MIT/ Cornell??
 
Where in the world do people buy real estate without valuation? And what the heck is the point of a valuation report when the price is agreed upon?
 
And since when is the original intention of a valuation report used to get housing loan only?? it's supposed to give both parties a sense of what is the likely open market value!

By definition, isn't a valuation simply the price people are willing to pay? 
 
So under this system what will happen?

valuation is supposed to be the estimate of selling price of a property based on arms length transaction.
 
however, that is just an estimate, and due to various factors including the intrinsic worth to individuals differ and hence you will find people paying less or more than valuation.
 
what will happen is anyone's guess, will be interesting to see how it pans out. But i would think the wiser move would be to let the market find its equilibrium given the influx of supply over the last few years instead of implementing such a radical idea

Why DBSS is an failure policy?
When a brand new HDB FLAT cost $800k, it is not a failure in the system? 
 
To me there are only 2 types of housing, Public housing and Private housing. Public housings are supposed to be affordable and for own stay. 800k? Plsssss. Give me just 4 walls and 1 door and i will happily pay you a real HDB price. Dont need to package it nicely with nice nice names such as dbss or what nonsense names. 
 
Hhd under that inhumane mbt has lost its original well intended mission of providing real affordable public housings to singaporeans. Even with his kicked out, my blood still boil everytime when i see him in tv on national events. Kbw is just trying to clean up his mess and steering the boat back to its original path. Is he doing a good job so far? I think yes on a wider picture. Do i like him? Errrrr.nope.

i still cannot understand the full implication of this new rule.  To me, prices of everything need to have some form of basis.  Our car's price is based on PARF, OMV, COE etc.  This forms the basis of the car's selling price.
 
KBW is trying to tackle the COV problem.  He's trying to take away our mindset of COV on flats.  Maybe he's thinking of helping the lower income families who really cannot afford the cash COV to purchase a flat.   If he's coming from this angle, I got to agree with him.  Many buyers spoilt the market by offering 100k or 50k over COV.  This kills alot of other potential buyers. It just takes one cash-rich buyer to spoilt the market.  It's unfair to the large community of buyers
 
Of coz, there are alot of argument about it.

too many variables in the equation to this new ruling. Hence i am perplexed why HDB choose to implement this x factor at this point in time? The best and most straight forward approach to bring HDB prices back to fundamentals is construct more flats than demand. And price new flats at the real subsidized price, which should be around 20-30% lower than current BTO price. The market will find its own equilibrium after that.
 
If HDB really wants to help low income who cannot afford COV, then build flats and allocate it to them, not by the BS balloting crap

from my understanding, they are speeding up alot of new flats at this moment.  I can see alot of hdb construction going around in estates.  Yeah, i got to agree that they need to simplify the new flat buying processes.  The balloting system needs to be tweaked or totally taken out. 
 
About the real subsidized price, at the end of the day, HDB will need to make some $$.  Their present-day objective is not to be a charity nor not make $$.  To make things really fair to the common ppl, HDB needs to go back to their original objective of its existence.

yes, they are building lots of new flats, but they have also announced they are slowing down the pace, which i do not agree as they have not fully caught up with demand yet. For public housing, the supply always have to be greater than demand. Otherwise we risk seeing another 2007-2013.
 
They have to build enough such that it would be a walk in selection again
 
Objective of HDB is to provide affordable housing. They have to revisit this term "affordable" which has been loosely thrown about. In my opinion it should be based on average single income earner and not using more than 20% of this take home pay to service a 20-25 year loan. That should be affordable for the average singaporean family.

1. Why do HDB need to MAKE $$? 
2. If not balloting, then how?  Balloting right now - they tweak to give first time and young family big big chance.  From what I know - this is about right, afterall, newly wed that wanna start family should get priority over 50+ couple getting their second flat right?

1. that is for HDB to answer. But they will tell you they lose $1 bilion every year
2. if everyone has to ballot means that there are not enough flats. In 2006, there were about 9,000 unsold HDB units. I think this is the right amount of vacant stock to hold to keep HDB market healthy. Also at that time, new flats were around 30% cheaper than resale, HDB should also maintain the gap and not increase BTO pricing at a rate faster than inflation.

Did HDB managed to sell off all those 9,000 unsold HDB units back in 2006? I think what HDB is practising now is to build flats only when people already selected the flat, and not build flat when there is demand. If HDB build flat when there is demand, i believe 9,000 or even 90,000 flats may not be enough.

forgot to add: by creating a new sub-market between HDB and EC, they are causing further housing price inflation as each sub-market commands its own price levels.
 
Thank You MBT!

Did HDB managed to sell off all those 9,000 unsold HDB units back in 2006? I think what HDB is practising now is to build flats only when people already selected the flat, and not build flat when there is demand. If HDB build flat when there is demand, i believe 9,000 or even 90,000 flats may not be enough.
 
what i meant was that HDB has to build beyond the demand. ie over supply.
 
I don't know what is the current stock now, but an excess of 9,000 vacant units will help to keep the demand in check in, and prevent a surge that is beyond HDB's control.
 
If 90,000 not enough, then build 100,000. If not enough then build 200,000. Keep building until HDB starts to accumulate a sizable stock of unsold flats. Then i would say that they have succeeded in their mission.

 damm well said!!! 
 
but but but.......is mbt doing this on his own accord or does he have approval from his bosses to do this? 
 

 
thank you!
 
Your question no need any answer one.. who has the balls to do anything in SG without permission from the top?

When a brand new HDB FLAT cost $800k, it is not a failure in the system?
 
To me there are only 2 types of housing, Public housing and Private housing. Public housings are supposed to be affordable and for own stay. 800k? Plsssss. Give me just 4 walls and 1 door and i will happily pay you a real HDB price. Dont need to package it nicely with nice nice names such as dbss or what nonsense names.
 
Hhd under that inhumane mbt has lost its original well intended mission of providing real affordable public housings to singaporeans. Even with his kicked out, my blood still boil everytime when i see him in tv on national events. Kbw is just trying to clean up his mess and steering the boat back to its original path. Is he doing a good job so far? I think yes on a wider picture. Do i like him? Errrrr.nope.

too many variables in the equation to this new ruling. Hence i am perplexed why HDB choose to implement this x factor at this point in time? The best and most straight forward approach to bring HDB prices back to fundamentals is construct more flats than demand. And price new flats at the real subsidized price, which should be around 20-30% lower than current BTO price. The market will find its own equilibrium after that.
 
If HDB really wants to help low income who cannot afford COV, then build flats and allocate it to them, not by the BS balloting crap

 Yalor, I also dun understand. Cant we just address the causes of the existing problems directly rather than all these actions:
 
1. BTO should be peg at cost based pricing approach. I note that market based pricing approach has been removed but the current price of BTO is still not at cost based pricing. Is it? Any expert in construction please advise. 
 
2. The review of the land sales by SLA where every piece of land has the potential to be Raffles Place. In particular to the land gazetted for public housing. 
 
Having all these small acts do not address the existing problems!

HDB should never be used for investment purpose in the first place.
I remember I bought my first HDB in Sengkang, to be exact Anchorvale lane in 2003. Really affordable even for an exec flat. less than 500 a month for mortgage
Near by has sports complex.. nice place and not too crowded. wow those days really nice

That should be the way. The price today should not cost you more than $750 mortgage, assuming the it follows inflation
 
But thanks for all the various policies, i think the installment would be $2,000, assuming 80% HDB loan at 30yrs.

from my understanding, they are speeding up alot of new flats at this moment.  I can see alot of hdb construction going around in estates.  Yeah, i got to agree that they need to simplify the new flat buying processes.  The balloting system needs to be tweaked or totally taken out. 
 
About the real subsidized price, at the end of the day, HDB will need to make some $$.  Their present-day objective is not to be a charity nor not make $$.  To make things really fair to the common ppl, HDB needs to go back to their original objective of its existence. 

 
 
The balloting system is there because the demand is high previously. I think the latest BTO is only like 2x oversubscribed. If you consider those that drop out of the queue, I think more or less GENERALLY there is much less balloting.
 
Actually the HDB price is just dropping slightly. The big wave will come when those hdb constructions get completed.
 
When People move into their new flats, they have to
1) sell away their old flats, increasae in the resale supply
2) stop renting/staying in their old flats, increase in the rental supply
 
That is where the impact will be felt. I think the small recent drop in HDB prices is by those people who are scared of this wave and decides to sell early...

I disagreed on this sentence " Kbw is just trying to clean up his mess and steering the boat back to its original path."
 
Whatever damages that that axx MBT had done had been done. Once the prices for HDB had been increased, it will never come down. KBW is just trying to slow down the increase of price at a slower rate so that everyone is happy.

 For me I buy lower and hold... not for resale... true that valuations are still sky high even without COV...

 
See who blinks first lo... 

 
 
IMHO, it is not a Q of who blinks 1st, it a Q of inserting pressure on Sellers to bring down resale prices further to landed and non landed properties.
 
What is the merits of the process ?
 
To garner buyer's confidence of resale flat to be in-line with landed/ non landed pty ?
 
No need valuation to assist them in mortgage loan or totally remove COV since valuation is not in place . Buyer & Seller to check with HDB recent transaction prices to determine the offer, its a big shift of paradigm of mindset.
 
All sellers want to sell high and buyers buying low, well it's pretty obvious that since no COV, how on earth they are gonna to renovate the new or resale flat next, it's 1-1 exchange, majority of Sinkies do not have cash element on hand,hence thy will go for bank reno loan, which in turn result on more headache.

HDB resale prices up slightly in March, more flats changing handshttp://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/hdb-resale-prices-slightly-march-more-flats-changing-hands-20140407
 
By Janice Heng

 
Resale prices of Housing Board flats edged up 0.3 per cent in March from a month before, according to Singapore Real Estate Exchange flash figures on Monday. But they were still 4.9 per cent lower than the same time last year.
There were also more transactions in March, with 1,319 resale flats changing hands - the highest volume since last October. This was up from just 951 in February, and comparable to the 1,356 flats sold in the same time last year.
The HDB resale process was changed on March 10, such that valuations could only be obtained after a transaction price was agreed. SRX thus did not release any figures for cash-over-valuation, the cash premium that used to be an important part of negotiations.
But transaction prices were generally $3,000 below SRX's own approximation of valuation, known as X-Value. This negative figure "means people are paying below recent transactions, causing downward pressure on prices," said SRX co-founder Jeremy Lee.

It is an inevitable path where prices are unlikely to continue to go up , those which wants to sell their flat will just have to accept that you might need to expect a lower buying price. The current government policy is finally working , harsher policies need to be in places to protect the home owners from property speculators.
 
For sellers a lower price quote , for the buyers , they would be waiting for a better price. At the end of the day , which moves first. Personally i would suspect the sellers. I am pretty there the "over" supply of ECs and condo recently would bring property markets to a crash in time to come as GDP growth and foreign investments start to move on from here.
 
For property and business , location location location , you cannot expect a place in sembawang to have the same prices as one in jalan membina or anywhere near town.

I have a question. If 2 persons (Muslim) are getting married, and both are currently existing HDB owner and/or joint owner, upon marriage, is 1 party required to relinquish his/her side of the flat ownership?  Is the below in bold & blue correct regardless ?  Thanks
=================================
 
Just saw this from hwz.
 
So long as you and your future spouse are not married. Then it is legal to have 2 units. Each co-own with your parents.However if you and your future spouse are legally married. Then 1 party would need to transfer the ownership.A quick way is to look at the Eligibility Conditions of buying a new flat and see if your case if listed there:

a friend of mine sold his 5 rm punggol flat 72 k below valuation. If not for the fact he has to migrate for good, he would have wait out. But in the end he basically break even.

Maybe its those people that complain flats are too ex for young couples, newly married etc
 
and I posted that they should lower the price for young couples, newly married etc
 
and they heard me.

Yeah lower price means also lower interest charges on the life of the loan.
 
And the interest charges over many years can add up to a lot.
 
I apologise if your kids are those "pay full cash" type.
 
I meant for people in general that have to take loans
 
for them the interest can be a killer.
