the chinese had brought illegal structure in a condominium or apartment to a whole new level.
 

the big question is how could the owner complete his mod? such big rocks and plants need to be hoist / transport up to the penthouse unit
 

all the residents in the building jiak sai liao and no one can stop him until he complete the illegal structure?

Nestled on top of a 26-story apartment building in Beijing is a two-story villa, surrounded by rock formations and scenic shrubbery, taking over the 1,000 square meter (11.00 square feet) rooftop area. Though the building, discovered by the Beijing Morning Post, actually took six years to finish, the man living in the rooftop home managed to get all the construction done without obtaining a single legal permit. 

Living in the extravagant house is a man only identified as a Mr. Zhang, who works as a professor. Residents in the building say that they have endured six years of loud construction noise as well as dealing with leaks and cracks in the walls as a result of the additional weight of the roof complex. Unfortunately for Professor Zhang, after six years, Zhang will have to find a new place to live.

Exactly! Think the authorities would have acted on something like that pretty quickly.

That's because the owner of the villa came from the Authority! He was a former party member of PRC garmen. 
 

Ppl living underneath have been complaining to the Authority for 6 yrs but in vain. But the piece of completed sh*t is just too hard to ignore after things went viral.

applause for the effort and determination to do such a massive project.
 

but really is the guy mentally alright to do this in modern city on top  of a tall building?
 

But the question is: how in the world did he bring up all the materials esp the rocks ? helicopter lifted?

This is just one of the cases in China.
 

There is another case where an entire estate of landed houses were built on the roof of a Shopping Complex.
 

Developer refused to demolish it after the Authority stepped in. Now they can't sell those landed houses.

Rich Chinese girl parks Maserati in middle of road
 


Shanghaiist.com reported about a 22-year-old woman from Chongqing, China, who parked her luxury car in the middle of the road. 

The report said that the woman, whose surname is Xu, had left her white Maserati Gran Turismo in the middle of a street in Yubei district as the parking garage at her workplace was fully occupied.
 

She said she had seen other cars parked in the middle of the road along the double yellow lines and followed suit, but could not explain where the other cars had disappeared to when questioned.
 

The report stated that a resident of the district had taken photos of Xu's terrible parking and contacted police who gave her a fine.
 

Sinopathic.com said that the incident happened on Aug 9, 2013 and Xu is a beautiful woman over 1.7m tall.
 

It reported that when Xu was told several disapproving opinions of her parking, she said that it is the type of car itself that may cause people to get angry.
 

She explained that the Maserati is registered in her grandmother's name and is not usually driven.
 

After receiving her fine, Sinopathic reported that Xu said she would never park like that again and would change her cars the next day.
