I don't think this question has ever been asked in this forum before. I am wondering how many here have a million cash in the bank now (not CPF) with the house they are living in now (hdb or private) fully paid and with zero debt? Please note that I am not talking about those sitting on paper assets as some bros here will probably say they can liquidate this and that property to have x millions, I am talking about those debtless people with a million cash in the bank now. 
 
If you are in this category, it would be interesting to hear what do you plan to do with your cash in the next couple of years?

FD, SSB, Single Premium Insurance, Blue Chip stocks - all add up to $1M counted?
i think no one is in their right mind to keep $1M cash in bank la
 
keeping total $1M cash in bank means losing money every single day
hence, that’s your answer to what to do with $1M cash liao
 
i assume $200K total cash as liquidity should suffice for the $1M category
if sifu Enye ... $200k cash is pocket money for 1 month nia ... hehe
for T2 not even enough to buy/sell full gold Rolexes ... lol

The million cash in the bank is usually short term, pending an investment decision. I think many in Singapore are sitting on a lot of cash in the bank now, thinking whether to divest in property, stocks, fx etc.

Cheng Hu has that billion dollar also tell you can only put down a deposit and borrow max... borrow max can invest more. Agree or not is a different story.
 
Nonetheless, I do believe there are many such people in SG. Property too ex, stocks too risky, only bonds and fixed deposits or CPF deposit (using cash). Prefer the security of cash or equivalent. 
 
In olden and developing scenarios which Govt allow boom and bust (or no choice but to allow), that strategy can be very fruitful once in a while.

For discussion’s sake.
 
If you have a million cash now.
 
1. Buy a property of $2M and put $1M as downpayment.
 
2. Buy Singtel shares. Current yield about 5% based on $3.35 share price. 
 
5 years down the road. Which option will yield better absolute returns.

Why not buy $1m properties? With additional 1% above 1m property and also interest from 1m, its better to pay full and rent out

What's your assumption in terms of property prices in 5 years? Average Interest rate and rental yield over the 5 years? Singhell share prices then? 
It's garbage in garbage out. Top many assumptions involved, making the comparison not very meaningful...

What's your assumption in terms of property prices in 5 years? Average Interest rate and rental yield over the 5 years? Singhell share prices then?
 
It's garbage in garbage out. Top many assumptions involved, making the comparison not very meaningful...

Truth is I have no idea. 
 
Although I would think the chance of seeing Singtel see $4 again is very high within the next 3 to 5 years.
 
I really really dunno what’s the upside for property in 5 years, conservatively. 
 
That’s why I am asking.

I always take 2% compounded gain averaged over long term, minus lease depreciation if relevant. This is probably half of the historical gain but is defensive enough. 
Add the rental gain minus all the costs one can think of.

Sometimes I wonder what can the ghost buy with hell bank notes..... nobody burn shops, so got money no shops in hell.  People burn cars without engine.  And the car so small, cannot go in.  In hell, all are Rolls Royce and Benz.  No service centre since nobody burn. And when people burn HP, they burn the actual size.  People burn a house, inside nothing, all chopsticks structure behind. 
Sometimes, I want to ask my relatives all these questions but yet seems so offensive.  So i’ve been keeping these questions without asking anyone.

I cant agree with T2 more.
 
If you go to any bank, the number of privilege banking clients have exploded. In DBS or UOB, you often see many milking the place with free drinks, biscuits and newspaper. why not?
 
Some say, the next recession or depression would be different, because many learnt from the last and have now plenty of cash waiting for investment.
 
One way the lay person can judge if there are just too much cash floating around, deposit rates are pathetic. People are not buying much at retail but that does not mean they are short of cash but on the contrary, they are more prudent now and looking for value for money products.
 
 
There are a few here I can safely say got more than $2million in cash locked in fixed deposit. You want me to name them for you,......

Never assume any amount of monies can make a person happily to declare retirement. 
Everyday seeing personal bank figure depleting do you reckon one can live long? The pressure and stress etc.

They (inexperienced..... even at 30++++++ if I may say so )  will fall for something emotional and invest in toxic products and in the end loose everything ..... and even do more sillier things to recoup their losses 
 Unless your got about $4-5 million Cash to spare and if its just a learning lesson for them 
I don't think its a right decision 
Let them earn thier keep; We earn our keep........ seems like this is  "the trend" in Singapore as its becoming more western nowadays as in the old Asian way;  we used to keep money for our kids future and they inherit and it goes on for the next and next gen; Unfortunately its not so anymore;

Let them earn thier keep; We earn our keep........ seems like this is  "the trend" in Singapore as its becoming more western nowadays as in the old Asian way;  we used to keep money for our kids future and they inherit and it goes on for the next and next gen; Unfortunately its not so anymore;
no lei....i see more richies or wannabe-richies spoiling their kids! If the kids are brought up with good values and characters they wont mind working hard for their own keeps. But i see more grown-up kids who are over-indulgence and is a spoilt brat because of the parents excesses! And thats how the world is going to be.....

Can we as grown adults make double within 3 years???
They (inexperienced..... even at 30++++++ if I may say so )  will fall for something emotional and invest in toxic products and in the end loose everything ..... and even do more sillier things to recoup their losses

No inflation? Should be more conservative and also estimate inflation at 2.4%
You and i know, Real inflation is probably 5%pa

Let me offer a different perspective to this million dollar story
 
This is the preface:
 
I think the happiest life is someone who:
 
- has a 4 room HDB flat and does not aspire to own more or bigger properties
- with a big close knit family - loving spouse, 2 to 3 kids, good relationship with parents and other siblings, uncles/aunties
- holding a stable job that neither pays too little , or pays too much (!)
- has a hobby that is fulfilling and offers a fun social circle
- is content and neither aspires or desires more wealth/recognition/fame
 
for someone like this, having/getting a million dollars in not important, but will be a happy thing, and will allow some nice treats for themselves and the family
 
---------
 
The truth is this - for someone who has earned a million dollars , usually means he is moving around in 'higher' (?) social circles
and is working in a place/industry where others also earn alot
 
such a person, with a million dollars, is less satisfied with that million dollars
because it will seem very little. Very little compared to others in the same social circles. or very little compared to what others in the industry is earning
 
you will think that how can someone with a million dollars debt free be not satisfied.... I can promise you this is 100% true
 
---------
 
So the one with less chance to have a million dollars is likely to be much happier than the one who will have a million dollars. Funny isn't it
 
I hope that my children will grow up to have the life I have mentioned in the first paragraph
which is worth a lot more than a million dollars

With 1 mln $ in bank, can last a long time. If your tottal monthly expenditure is about 2K$, it should last about 40 years. Correct me if I am wrong.
You have a fabulous life with a monthly expenditure of $2k.
Your private bankers must be treating you to lunch and dinner everyday.
And inviting you to golf and lifestyle events.
 
No wonder you can survive on $2k a month

FD, SSB, Single Premium Insurance, Blue Chip stocks - all add up to $1M counted?
i think no one is in their right mind to keep $1M cash in bank la
 
keeping total $1M cash in bank means losing money every single day
hence, that’s your answer to what to do with $1M cash liao
 
i assume $200K total cash as liquidity should suffice for the $1M category
if sifu Enye ... $200k cash is pocket money for 1 month nia ... hehe
for T2 not even enough to buy/sell full gold Rolexes ... lol

 
dont play play. there are people with $1m cash in bank. and these people could be aunties you see everyday at wet markets or cleaners wiping your office table. source: I work in bank.

Kua Nua Goon and top up medicine: Maybe $100-300 per month (if lucky at 70 years old), not including parent bills if they are still around.
 
All kinds of tax bills (property tax at least)?: $100-300 per month
 
Insurance?: $300 per month (let's say reduce to the minimum)
 
Utilities?: Unless sleep in tent everyday, it should be $200 per month.
 
Ang pow for relatives wedding?: Chao chao $100 per month.

Sometimes I wonder what can the ghost buy with hell bank notes..... nobody burn shops, so got money no shops in hell.  People burn cars without engine.  And the car so small, cannot go in.  In hell, all are Rolls Royce and Benz.  No service centre since nobody burn. And when people burn HP, they burn the actual size.  People burn a house, inside nothing, all chopsticks structure behind.
 
Sometimes, I want to ask my relatives all these questions but yet seems so offensive.  So iâve been keeping these questions without asking anyone.

I don't think this question has ever been asked in this forum before. I am wondering how many here have a million cash in the bank now (not CPF) with the house they are living in now (hdb or private) fully paid and with zero debt? Please note that I am not talking about those sitting on paper assets as some bros here will probably say they can liquidate this and that property to have x millions, I am talking about those debtless people with a million cash in the bank now. 
 
If you are in this category, it would be interesting to hear what do you plan to do with your cash in the next couple of years?

For discussion’s sake.
 
If you have a million cash now.
 
1. Buy a property of $2M and put $1M as downpayment.
 
2. Buy Singtel shares. Current yield about 5% based on $3.35 share price.
 
5 years down the road. Which option will yield better absolute returns.

 
Buy $1m property and borrow $500k.
 
Buy $500k of Singtel shares
 
If interest rate stays low, you should be able to cover your loan interest with Singtel dividend and pocket the difference.  
 
Diversification is your free lunch.
 
Not answering to your question but I don't think anyone can.  If property prices remain at current level in next 5 years, Singtel should give you better returns purely by virtue of its higher yield and the effect of compounded return.  Property yield is crappy even with some low cost debt.

I dont want to jump to conclusions so let me ask you.
For your above comparison, how much Singtel shares are you buying? $2mil or $1mil
 
This is to see if you are indeed making a fair (lousy) comparison or a flawed (lousy) one.
Give you a chance to redeem yourself.

Ps The fact that singtel shares are so much more liquid than a property, is already an advantage in itself.
 
Thank you thank you.
 
Plse burn more.  
I need it.  
 
Burn some cigars too
$1m singtel shares and keep adding every month based on the monthly mortgage I would need to pay for a property loan of $1m.

Got your point. It just that everyone is shouting property is the way to go for the next 3 years but when I work out the sums it appears I might be better off just buying Singtel........

Property only makes sense if you don't have to pay 11 percent ABSD (either decoupled or first property) , and if you can leverage, and that's assuming prices go up 20 or 30 percent and you sell without incurring too SSD. 
If you think any of the above can't be met, then you are probably better off investing in other things.

In a forum, any bankrupt can become a "millionaire", any "millionaire" could also be a bankrupt. I am not keen to find out the real identity of forumers with a million sitting in the bank now, moreso what they will do with that money in the next couple of years. Everybody has their different take on investments, it is always good to hear from those with ready cash to splurge.

It’s always good to take data and see for yourself. 
Imagine you have paper dollar $1 mil today.
 
1. Put the money in fixed deposit.
 
2. Place in SingTel shares and collect dividends and appreciation (tax free)
 
3. Place 31% in a property of your choice and run through the process of rent collection plus appreciation, which incurs tax as well. Leftover place in an imagined instrument of choice.
 
End of 2018, do an evaluation see which is better.
 
The property up tick will likely go on till 2020 so by end 2018, you can already see which is better.

Having a million cash at the different stages of your life will not be the same.
 
For instance, during the early part of your life, it is more likely that one will take more risk in hope for better returns. 
 
But as you grow older, the emphasis might be different as children and family starts to need more money.
 
That said, any economy would need investment and growth be it organically or economic. It is the same for a person or family. 
 
Personally what I will do is to split it into 3 parts, the % ratio will differ individually. 
 
1. Liquid assets or cash (for e.g gold or bonds) where you can easily convert into cash if there is any need for money.
 
2. In any investment which gives you a yield, be it in property or in blue chips where the purpose is giving you a stable passive income.
 
3. Lastly, I would put some in what I say as personal growth, it can be an MBA or a business or even a property or a risky investment like bitcoin/shares which you might not see any returns for the next few years but it has the "potential" of giving you something more than whatever you expect to have in the regular investments.
 
That said, any proper use of debt will help in growing your wealth but over dependent on it will result in mistakes or mismanagement of your finances will affect your mental and physical well-being. 
 
Don't end up blindly chasing for financial pursues only to find out you missed out too much in life, a person does not need a million cash to enjoy their life, neither a million in debt to burden it. 
 
This is my personal opinion. Of course everyone has to die, maybe you can also confirm buying some Kim zhua or housing to burn too. Given the uncertainty. Lol

Best is not to keep too much cyber social network, or rely too much on it, just get your friends out for lunch or dinner and meet, networking is best done physically.
 
Leaving too much information online usually compromise your cyber security which will affect your real life if one is malicious.

$1m singtel shares and keep adding every month based on the monthly mortgage I would need to pay for a property loan of $1m.
Heehee so you thought through it a bit to redeem yourself eh?
But no. 
 
If the property commitment is $2mil upfront, then for a fair comparison your stock investment should also be the same.   
 
You can always take $1mil loan and $1mil cash and buy $2mil stocks and use dividend to reducing outstanding loan.  Just as how you use rental to cover some mortgage.
 
But as i always say, both these asset classes are required, and its never one better than the other.
Voodooman also pointed out the diversification advantage.
 
Cheers

Lastly, I would put some in what I say as personal growth, it can be an MBA or a business or even a property or a risky investment like bitcoin/shares which you might not see any returns for the next few years but it has the "potential" of giving you something more than whatever you expect to have in the regular investments.
 
That said, any proper use of debt will help in growing your wealth but over dependent on it will result in mistakes or mismanagement of your finances will affect your mental and physical well-being. 
 
Don't end up blindly chasing for financial pursues only to find out you missed out too much in life, a person does not need a million cash to enjoy their life, neither a million in debt to burden it. 
 
This is my personal opinion. Of course everyone has to die, maybe you can also confirm buying some Kim zhua or housing to burn too. Given the uncertainty. Lol

 
Well said, remember to burn more for me

There are people who can survive on 2k a month. Do not assume that everyone live the type of life you live. 
You have a fabulous life with a monthly expenditure of $2k.Your private bankers must be treating you to lunch and dinner everyday.And inviting you to golf and lifestyle events.No wonder you can survive on $2k a month

I cant agree with T2 more.
 
If you go to any bank, the number of privilege banking clients have exploded. In DBS or UOB, you often see many milking the place with free drinks, biscuits and newspaper. why not?
 
Some say, the next recession or depression would be different, because many learnt from the last and have now plenty of cash waiting for investment.
 
One way the lay person can judge if there are just too much cash floating around, deposit rates are pathetic. People are not buying much at retail but that does not mean they are short of cash but on the contrary, they are more prudent now and looking for value for money products.
 
 
There are a few here I can safely say got more than $2million in cash locked in fixed deposit. You want me to name them for you,......

Totally agree.

Heehee so you thought through it a bit to redeem yourself eh?
But no. 
 
If the property commitment is $2mil upfront, then for a fair comparison your stock investment should also be the same.   
 
You can always take $1mil loan and $1mil cash and buy $2mil stocks and use dividend to reducing outstanding loan.  Just as how you use rental to cover some mortgage.
 
But as i always say, both these asset classes are required, and its never one better than the other.
Voodooman also pointed out the diversification advantage.
 
Cheers
Yap. Need to do that as a fair comparison but I was thinking not to leverage to buy shares. Understand the borrowing costs are not cheap. Possible to get less than 2%? 
 
If so then this probably suits me more. Liquidity is pretty high on my list.

To add on to what T2 said about inflation of 5%, I get it...finally
 
Last night I walk to a coffee shop to buy a packet of Kopi C Kosong. its a treat for myself. I hand over S$1.20 and the guy said its S$1.30.
 
I was shocked as why would a packet of coffee's price increase AGAIN in just 1 year?
 
I only had S$1.20 with me.. and the owner tell me to pay next time.
 
Come to think of it, I better worker harder and smarter so that I can afford to counter the inflation...imagine a packet of KOPI C Kosong cost S$ 2.80 10 years down the road..

I don't think this question has ever been asked in this forum before. I am wondering how many here have a million cash in the bank now (not CPF) with the house they are living in now (hdb or private) fully paid and with zero debt? Please note that I am not talking about those sitting on paper assets as some bros here will probably say they can liquidate this and that property to have x millions, I am talking about those debtless people with a million cash in the bank now. 
 
If you are in this category, it would be interesting to hear what do you plan to do with your cash in the next couple of years?

 
Aiya, buy SSB la if low risk appetite. Leave 6 months of cash in account will do, keep so much also not useful.

Remember about 10 yrs ago, popiahs were $1-$1.20?
Now they are $2.50 easily in many places
 
And pratas were 50-60cts  
Today easily 90cts $1
 
Yes likelihood of your kopi being $2.50 is very high in 10 yrs

As for how much to pass on to your kids, Buffett once offered a good rule of thumb: The perfect amount to leave to your kids, he told Fortune in 1986, is ''enough money so that they would feel they could do anything, but not so much that they could do nothing.''

Trump wants popular vote and will be expansionist but whether US interest rate will go up to 4-5%, noone know.  Americans strive on leverage, so growth will continue to accelerate.

Yes, long term rate are now much higher, US mortgage market is priced based on long term interest rate, IIRC.  10 year treasury is already close to 3%, market is watching if it will go to 4% next.   
Trump is an egomanic, he already made his money, at his age, he is just out to change America and hopefully, leave a legacy for himself.

But who knows i may need to full cash on a property?

Not everything is about properties.
 
In fact, this group likely comprises business owners and super high income earners who other than their primary residence, are unlikely to adopt properties as their main investment tool in the current climate of progressive taxes (ABSD and personal income taxes).
 
They can buy anytime, but so can the same foreign counterparts worldwide, as long as they are willing to pay the 15% + 4% ABSD.

Unless you have a clear better idea or needed money urgently, this is the worst timing to cash out after enduring the trough, in my opinion. 
At least T2 cash out timing was the best in recent years.

Thanks but this is the purely cash portion.
I already have stocks, bonds, funds, alternatives, physical gold Rolex, etc....
Property, i have stayed out as the yield sucked.
But who knows i may need to full cash on a property?
 
See how lah.  
If bond duration too long, i dont like also.
Rates are on its way up.
I need to see at least 5% yields to make a move.
 
Good luck to all.
Lend to ah long

I have also liquidated all my local ptys except for the one I am staying coz the yield truly sucks. Cashing out is the only sensible thing to do at this juncture.
Ah I see.....no wonder you keep telling people not to buy....no more property except your roof har?  That explains all your bias, bearish posts with regards to property investments in Singapore.....I salute you...brave! But at least you did not sell even your only roof and rent...if like that sure pissing in the pants to see why prices ain’t dropping more.  
 
Nevertheless, the current climate where signs of a recovery in the ppty mkt is gaining momentum (both in terms of volume of transactions and stabilization of prices) you must be wondering if you have made the right choice liquidating your investment properties.  But of course it all boils down to when you sold your property as you might still be net positive if you get back in the game soon, otherwise you might end up like your `handle’ LPPL lol

Just on his rationale mainly cashing out due to low yields I also followed that approach, the property market is not as rewarding as before and low yields was why I also cashed out.
 
I took some basic calculations on the property I held or have held as below as an example, note I have not included in interest charge and other factors (repairs, property agent fees etc) which would drive the yields even lower.
 
Industrial yields were fairly stable having no need for repairs
 
Residential .
2007 - 5% (Gross) 4% (Nett of MCST & Tax) - Using rental in 2007 vs property valued price
2017 - 3% Gross) 2% (Nett of MCST & Tax) - Using rental in 2017 vs property valued price
 
Industrial 
2012 - 6% Gross 5% (Nett of MCST & Tax) - Using rental in 2012 vs property valued price
2018 - 4% Gross 3% (Nett of MCST & Tax) - Using rental in 2018 vs property valued price

The approach is sound if you have good plans for the proceeds. 
But yields also have cycle. We have probably just passed the trough of the yield cycle as well with vacancy just starting to dip. The enbloc sellers coming in hordes right after their proceed collections will soak up the remaining built vacancies in no time and buy up many of the new sales sites, not including the foreigners who may have seen this or needs to buy in SG for own stay.

Interesting ... thanx for your analysis. I think in future as the property prices gradually increase the rental yields will drop further so it really depends what we define as viable. 
 
With more and more people not being able to technically afford to buy private property (the caveat - of a decent size!), more and more people will be renting ...
 
Hmmmm ...  sounds like HK ... any thoughts?

This enbloc wave is not everlasting. What happens  after the developers fill up their land bank? More units will be released to the market. Not immediately but certainly in few years time. Isn't this like musical chair? U took away 1 chair but replace with 2 later.

To be frank from a property investors view I see little upside in the current market, the en bloc fever and newly minted millionaires will soak up some of the available units priced in this market but that would mean the current market sustains its pricing. Previously from 2005 pmwards we had a few factors which drove up pricing mainly influx of foreigners (property price and rental) and a decade long era of decreasing interest rates.
 
Going forth its likely interest rates will move upwards, population is also stagnating with migration of white collar jobs moving to cheaper locations and in a few years once the development of these en-bloced properties hit the market I'm assuming each unit will become 2 or more units further adding to the units on the market. Unless some changes happen in this space i.e increase population or continuing low interest rates I don't see how things will rise as before.
 
If one is very selective in the unit they buy barring en bloc its possible to maybe garner a decent return over 5 years but I see the upside as limited though but a possibility of a big downside if global economy takes a hit.
 
That said with property there is also a lot of luck involved, for example I picked up a D5 property at below 800 psf because the owner was having relationship difficulties and was looking to clear it quick. 
 
These are my personal views though, not looking to impose them on anyone.

HK rental is sky high though, even the parking lot rental is expensive. 
 
Also having increasing property price and dropping rental yields would indicate either population going up and people are buying for self stay or constantly upgrading or cash rich investors just plonking the money down without any care for yield I don't either of these scenarios being too evident in Sg.

The residential yield is low but people buy in anticipation of price appreciation. Even the aunty at the coffeshop thinks property will earn money in 2018 and 2019........ 
 
I find it simpler to put the money in a basket of blue chips and settle for 4-5% yield.
Sure, share market may correct but who is to say it won't bring the property sector down with it. At least you can pick 10 counters to buy.

What I read is very limited downside. For seasoned investors with properties to their names, the ABSD may limit the profitability. For example, if private property prices rise 15% in 2-3 years (still a far far cry from its spectacularly rising days), the nett profitability is just 5%. 
But for those who can be first timers, or those who believe the gains can be higher than 20% in 2-3 years for the segment they are interested in,  it is still hugely profitable.

Personally I find in funny for people to expect prices to increase indefinitely due to "limited" lands paces when they fail to address to this primary concern. Demand? 
 
Infinite pay increments? Limitless opportunities? Boundless investments coming our way?
 
Where is the jobs coming from??! Yes all the "projections" are taken from the backdrop of Hong Kong which has an entire China population to fall back on being the business gateway, what do we have? Indo? 
 
Now indo is doing their infrastructure upgrades it is just a matter of time when they don't need us. I don't understand why this blinded optimism.

Blinded or not, let the data speak for itself. 
I may have been early in predicting events (about half to one year ahead) but so far they have all come true.
 
Anyway, five childcare seats to replace one huge sofa is also not exactly optimistic if you get what is meant.

Data? Based on past 5 years or past 10?  Based it on a entire economic cycle which is roughly 50 years, since the start of the nation, we have not experienced a major correction in asset prices mainly due to the huge amount of savings via cpf and stuff for us to tide through. 
 
Telling my parents generation that this is meant for your retirement and those crap. Now they are retiring now the garment say not enough. My dad say nbcb if like this I might as well do my own investment, put simi cpf last time one ang mor chu only 30k. Now a landed is easily 1.5mio, which mean 50x return over let's say 30-40 year. Do you think if the cpf of 30k payout then til now will be 50x? So where did the balance go to? 
 
Now that I am guessing is depleted (hopefully still there), the garment is finding more and more ways to get more taxes when I struggle to find reasons why the need unless they already spent it.
 
So how do you think they will have more money to invest in better technologies to push us forward of the pack? And attract more investment use mouth? Based on blind faith? OK you wanna play numbers, tell me the yearly reported foreign investment numbers in Sg. See how much difference is it compared to the gross debt. 
 
Do you know the average debt or credit that everyone in sg is having if you removed the top 5% of the people. I won't give you the estimate as it is p&c but I will tell you that it is much more than 10x of the average annual salary. How to invest more? Borrow more? Where does the money come from??! 
 
Year on year real wage is actually decreasing if you price in inflation. What you say as "growth" is just merely inflation. 
 
So good in predicting can you tell me in private what is the number coming out for toto. If it comes out, I believe you

In 20-30 years time, baby boom generation would be passing away, what are going to happen to these 40-60 years lease flats? In the heartland, i’m constantly reminded of these tsunami of supply that will come. It will be a challenge to fill them up to support the housing price. Govt will have to have lots of money to buy back to support the market hence the taxes. Once the confidence of housing price crack, hell breaks loose.
 
Meanwhile enjoy the musical chair game. When party ends, everyone will be rushing to the door.

Actually on the contrary, their debt levels are even higher, probably the interest monthly they paid is probably a Singaporean's average annual pay. 
Ya damn heavy, now my medishield plans cannot even cover my medical expenses even if I opt to pay the additional top ups. Plus they increased my parents coverage cost, wah damn siong

echoing on @ch_co post I'm also struggling to see where this demand will stem from, barring population explosion the govt is already trying to build out the next big thing to drive the demand (Fintech, Biotech etc) and there still uncertainty on how successful this will be.
 
I see differently on the risk of downsides, but hey thats what makes the market exciting right differing views  
 
What I read is very limited downside. For seasoned investors with properties to their names, the ABSD may limit the profitability.

Guys, having more HDBs supply cheap is good for all. There are growing numbers of singles and divorcees due to marriage decline and failure rates. The recent loosening of criteria for divorcees to buy HDB is one avenue. There are also the grandchildren who will benefit in 30 years time when the baby boomers start to decline in population. This also is a good outlet for downgraders from private owners.
 
Now TFR cannot be solved by private property. Housing size is also mainly solved by HDB which is addressed by BTO and resale HDB.
 
Private serves investment needs and will only get costlier due to the cost issues, resulting in cost push inflation. Expect smaller and higher PSF which will pull up the price of well located and not too old properties (for upgraders and investors), or feed back into the enbloc sites demand and supply (for older sites).
 
As the new sites are completed, the population growth will be calibrated to fit. LSS has recently allowed agencies to exercise some discretion in employing necessary talent. It’s a blanket term.

1. More social problems created. Allowing these instead letting the couples work things out. Dumb thing to do. 
 
2. Most children born in the 90s would probably not need to buy property due to the hand me downs from their grandparents. 
 
3. Again wishful thinking when you do not see the policies and potential growth is not aligned. The garmen is only harping on one single trick no backup nothing.
 
4. Education is slowly getting there in most of our neighbours, due to their massive population, the likelihood of finding talent would be easier, businesses would eventually think off a way to find themselves there where labor and land is cheaper (you also expecting returns on property, it would mean higher labor costs right, sums don't work out)
 
5. The risk of importing talents, you run a risk of employing a entire batch of crap. 
 
Some time back in one of my projects with a group of so called talents boasting to have MBAs only to find out that many of these talents can't even speak properly, less to say type a proper email which probably takes a normal person 5 mins to draft and maybe another 15min to read through max. 
 
Even with my poor language ability I can do it. These people took half a day to draft that stupid email and another half to let another check. That project which I thought could be done in 2-4max weeks eventually took 2 and half months to complete. 
 
I have recently heard news that some of these people were suspended as they found out some of these people had fake MBAs and inferior degrees posing to worth more than what they are supposed to be. Talents? 
 
Just go to changi business Park and look at how many taking a break at 10am and then 2 hours lunch and then another break at 3. The cateria is always full during these working hours. 
 
Lunch I can accept the rest hard. That said there are still good and hard workint people there just only the black sheeps give it a bad impression.

It has come to a stage where yields you get from bonds are on par or doing better than property yields. The difference is bonds are more easy to liquidate than property.

beside rental yield, property value can skyrocket 5-10-15-20% in a couple of years, no?
 
and in 10 years may be even higher? isn’t that is the current trajectory?

Ah I see.....no wonder you keep telling people not to buy....no more property except your roof har? That explains all your bias, bearish posts with regards to property investments in Singapore.....I salute you...brave! But at least you did not sell even your only roof and rent...if like that sure pissing in the pants to see why prices ain’t dropping more.
 
Nevertheless, the current climate where signs of a recovery in the ppty mkt is gaining momentum (both in terms of volume of transactions and stabilization of prices) you must be wondering if you have made the right choice liquidating your investment properties. But of course it all boils down to when you sold your property as you might still be net positive if you get back in the game soon, otherwise you might end up like your `handle’ LPPL lol

 
Not about brave or bias, just use your common sense more and you will understand. Get back in the game? You think I am that desperate to do that? You think those who buy a property in this kind of market are going to sell 5 years later for 50% gain? You just believe agents so easily and be psychoed by them? You think the 2-3% rental yield now is fantastic? There are so many fixed income instruments out there with better yields than the measly 2-3% that most Singapore properties are yielding now, and I am not even talking about stocks!

beside rental yield, property value can skyrocket 5-10-15-20% in a couple of years, no?
 
and in 10 years may be even higher? isn’t that is the current trajectory?

 
Lehman brothers was in 2008, from that year property has already doubled or tripled. In fact, we should be looking at a correction and preparing for that. The banks and developers are just playing musical chairs now and hoping that the music doesn't stop.

Personally I find in funny for people to expect prices to increase indefinitely due to "limited" lands paces when they fail to address to this primary concern. Demand?
 
Infinite pay increments? Limitless opportunities? Boundless investments coming our way?
 
Where is the jobs coming from??! Yes all the "projections" are taken from the backdrop of Hong Kong which has an entire China population to fall back on being the business gateway, what do we have? Indo?
 
Now indo is doing their infrastructure upgrades it is just a matter of time when they don't need us. I don't understand why this blinded optimism.

 
The funniest is people saying our pty here will move in the same direction as hk due to land scarcity. In hk only 7% of land can build residential, in sg, majority of the land is flat. It will take decades before we even come close to a situation like hk.

Same price growth for major cities in China with huge swathes of land... Relatively from 2013 we have become some 40% cheaper comparatively. 
But the years before that, there were many periods both SG and HK prices moved similarly.
 
The key was the TDSR implemented in 2013.

It has come to a stage where yields you get from bonds are on par or doing better than property yields. The difference is bonds are more easy to liquidate than property. 
 
Don't need bonds (which has a risk of price fluctuation/drop), even FD is generating or even exceeding the property yield (not counting capital appreciation/ABSD/SSD/Leverage etc).

Do you know China is facing the largest property oversupply in years, many are ghost cities now or left half built. Yes probably in the "golden" areas where the business activities are  there might be some growth but the average areas get really bad now. My cousin which works there is telling me rental is dropping sharply so how can the prices go the other way?  
So I am not really sure which part of China you are referring to, it is a very big place and they will encounter the same problem as us in 20-30 year where their population ages really fast and not enough babies are produced. So how is the demand sustained?

Understand. That’s why the TDSR is essential. 
I personally believe in 2-3-% growth as the long term sustainable solution as it allows us to reach those levels in 20 years.
 
If one factors yield together with a 2% growth everything will make sense. But the current growth will be high to catch up.

Some are ok to take 2% net and wait for the capital appreciation (which comes with more and more assumptions) while people like me prefer to just invest in 5-6% p.a. yield.
 
People often overlook the fact that at 7% p.a. yield, you double your money in 10 years (compounded).

Do you leverage to achieve the 5-6% pa yield?
For me, it is always better to spread out the investment asset if possible.

Actually adjusted rental minus all expenses plus appreciation of 2% per annum easily beats 7% annual gains based on invested amount, with the rest based on loans. 
Only if fully paid and rented at say 2.8% gross yield and appreciates at 2%, the yield falls below 5%.
 
Discounting the one off enbloc gain when the property approximates 30 years or so.
 
Yes, doubling is very real. Tripling too. Make time and money both work for you.

You have to take $1M to buy property fully paid up or buy equities fully paid up. No leverage. 
 
If wanna talk leverage, you can leverage to buy equities too.
 
Catch the share price at the correct cycle, can double too. No need 30 years wait for en bloc. 
 
The discussion is $1M where to put to get best bang for buck. Not whether property can make money or not. Rather can Property give the best results 3,5,10 or 20 years down the road?

Mind me asking roughly how many properties have you traded/vested. Also what is your approach when identifying a property for investment and giving returns? For example do you look for new / old properties? Residential, industrial etc?

Three of my local properties based on market value if sell today will return me about 1 million SGD exactly.
 
The combined monthly rent is $6900 exactly.
 
I have only bought new residential properties so far, and that is the category longest to reach the desired results.
 
I believe that if the category that breakeven the slowest is doable, any other categories work too.

Actually if we listened to bro Tenyawph, just buy Creative shares at $4 and sell the next day at $8 to $10. Overnight can double, overnight can also half. My stocks achieve more than 10% average annual growth for the last 10 years or so, but I always limit the liquidity I have as I do not trust my own emotions. 
 
What I propose is a slow sustainable wait for the 5-7% annually to work its magic timed with the time we expect to retire.

450K to 3.5M sounds really impressive....
 
but if you look at compounding returns, that is about 6.5% over 33 years.
 
AND that was over our GOLDEN period.......... am afraid this type of gains not possible going forward.
 
This is why many say that opportunities abound    ................. nong nong ago. Now the new normal is 2-3% gain.

5 to 7 % annual increase achieved by many and I must say those who did it will always point towards history to say  property is a sure bet. But we are talking about the heydays of our golden period.  
 
However Singapore's best days are over. In a mature economy, you cannot expect those returns for the next 3 decades. 
 
We had a LKY who was ahead of his time which allowed people to buy a condo a 450K and sell at 3M now. 
 
Now we have a team who is busy singing sorri sorri sorri.................  
 
Property is still doable, but only as part of my overall asset diversification plus I may not want to buy the cow cos I want to drink milk.

I maintain that it is still highly doable to achieve those rates.
 
In fact, without the cooling measures and TDSR coming in, today's prices will easily be some 30% higher without the rent following, and we would maybe be staring at sub 2% yields (maybe in HK right now).
 
LKY is a man with a vision but he always had his critics even in his heyday. My relatives cursed and swore even when they passing up the chances to buy landed / condo at yesterday's prices.

The main question says, Anyone?
 
Which means you can interpret it in any way. Full debt or zero debt with that arrangement of 1 million dollars. 
 
But the fundamental is why put a million dollar in bank, have zero debt, when there are a dozen ways to easily easily beat that arrangement??? Even T2 would not put that million in the bank, but perhaps prefer a hybrid system of property, equity and bonds.
 
How about take 300K out to loan for one property and the rest to distribute across other instruments if comfortable?
 
Why disallow anyone from sharing how they would distribute the sum? My figures are all based on recent transactions. Already got people offer at higher than the recent transactions but I am not looking to sell but just park the figures based on market values for reference.My interest to bank is about 25,000 per month, but the tenants return some 50,000 into the mortgage annually after removing other expenditure.
 
Not good? Do you advocate to sell then?

1 million worth of asset and 1 million used to leverage is two different things here.
 
I cite an example, I bought shorted hang seng index back in 2007-8 for the good half of it , I borrow to the holt because the market continues continues to go against me. Only for me take back whatever I have lost and then some more. The return over that period of time is more than 20x based on initial amounts. So that also meant someone lost the amount since it is a zero sum game.
 
So if your idea is based on a leveraged items then it is apple to apple that net amounts you are talking about is far more than 1million. The risk is also different.

even now with multiple loans on numerous properties 
you still so bullish?  next purchase, next set of cooling measures and another price spike in the short term?
 
no wonder you can project steady 2-3% annual capital gains on your properties over the next 30-40 years

ð¬ð

Certain years it will be 5-10% as well. Remember, when my tenants start paying more than I pay the bank, just roll with it.
 
One other suggestion for the really insecure: pay up one mortgage that you live in, and it will be very easy to picture how to cope with the rest. Especially especially true for those who can qualify for first timers. How to meet the contradictory situation is up to you.
 
Just mark these words and ignore the noise.

Let me offer a different perspective to this million dollar story
 
This is the preface:
 
I think the happiest life is someone who:
 
- has a 4 room HDB flat and does not aspire to own more or bigger properties
- with a big close knit family - loving spouse, 2 to 3 kids, good relationship with parents and other siblings, uncles/aunties
- holding a stable job that neither pays too little , or pays too much (!)
- has a hobby that is fulfilling and offers a fun social circle
- is content and neither aspires or desires more wealth/recognition/fame
 
for someone like this, having/getting a million dollars in not important, but will be a happy thing, and will allow some nice treats for themselves and the family
 
---------
 
The truth is this - for someone who has earned a million dollars , usually means he is moving around in 'higher' (?) social circles
and is working in a place/industry where others also earn alot
 
such a person, with a million dollars, is less satisfied with that million dollars
because it will seem very little. Very little compared to others in the same social circles. or very little compared to what others in the industry is earning
 
you will think that how can someone with a million dollars debt free be not satisfied.... I can promise you this is 100% true
 
---------
 
So the one with less chance to have a million dollars is likely to be much happier than the one who will have a million dollars. Funny isn't it
 
I hope that my children will grow up to have the life I have mentioned in the first paragraph
which is worth a lot more than a million dollars
Very good point.   
I belong to the first group.
 
I may not be the happiest person, but I am definitely very thankful and contented.

Would be nice for interest rates to go back to 3-4% like in the late 90s early 2000s
 
At least get something decent for my cash.

Certain years it will be 5-10% as well. Remember, when my tenants start paying more than I pay the bank, just roll with it.
 
One other suggestion for the really insecure: pay up one mortgage that you live in, and it will be very easy to picture how to cope with the rest. Especially especially true for those who can qualify for first timers. How to meet the contradictory situation is up to you.
 
Just mark these words and ignore the noise.

 
they say leverage is a double edged sword and so far in the last 10 years, we have only seen the good side of leverage
 
the bad side hasn't shown up yet in this time frame....in the most recent time it showed up in 2007/2008, look what happened
 
roll on in the mean time bah i guess....

Actually 2007-2008 created the problems leading to huge price growth. In fact, any time the huge economies fumble, huge currency devaluation leading to price growth (uncontrolled inflation) will take place. 
And it’s wrong to say we have only seen the good side of leverage.
 
The Govt bravely implemented the most draconian measure known to human kind called TDSR in 2013 to stem leverage. Prices dropped from 2013 to 2016 as those overleveraged and Swimming naked sold properties at huge discounts.
 
The bad side showed itself for the longest duration in SG history, even though the amplitude of fall was not as great as naysayers hoped.
 
Rental prices were the lowest I experienced in recent years actually and it can only get better.
