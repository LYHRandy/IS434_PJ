yah lor... last time i went and see its ard that price......damn itch to commit but did not coz after working out the sums...i find that its quite tight to commit a condo. Dunno whether its luck or blessing in diguise.. in the end managed to secure a unit in Tampines (The Premier- first DBSS)and the best part of it..i bought it before the rise of property market..

What is the floor area?
 
Realised nowadays that even 3 bedroom units can be very small also.

Thats a very good size....149 is aroudn 1600sq feet (the size of an older HDB executive apartment)
 
Assuming the 900K is a 113sqm (1200sqft, size of an HDB room) about $750psf. Quite reasonable price considering a resale HDB 5 room flat in that are can easily cost 500K.

But design of the rooms play a part. If there are lots of turns and corners, then your useable space decreases. that's why old style pte apt and hdb flat always look so big cos all square design and useable space.
 
i heard the flower planter also counted as part of your unit space.  
 
Seriously I won't buy a condo there as totally surrounded. No peace and serenity. 
 
But good for those who go MCF weekly meet up. Can practically walk there.

Bro, if u r looking to buy that unit for investment purposes...u can look at this property just behind plaza singapura. Its just newly launched. Good price, within your budget also, for long term investment.

Yea, understand..coz its in orchard road area after all, but if the TS is looking to buy a 900+K leasehold condo unit in bishan for investment purposes now, i'd recommend the Parc Sophia. (2 bedroom units going from 980K onwards)

simei is quiet.    pace of life seems slower the moment you enter it. don't know why.
 
and it's true lots of owners rent their units to Indian FTs. When I was staying there for 4 months, everyday there is a heavy smell of curry in my apt coming from outside.
 
Not sure is it because they not too particular about cleanliness, their kokroaches came into my unit via the dustbin. Damn disgusting. I sprayed 1 can of Baygon into the dustbin in 1 week. And in my old place, I could not even finish 1 can in 5 years.

Newton too noisy and busy for me liao. I pass by there every day.
 
I prefer a more serene and quiet environment. Was looking at Upper East Coast early last year, hesitated for 2 weeks and the prices all shot up by over 10%.   Now I contented with my current place. Small but lots of useable space. Easy for cleaning too.
