1. I'm seriously looking at moving to a HDB unit. But wonder which is a choice estate to live in?
 
2. I drove to Potong Pasir just now, I find it quite a pleasant estate though looks kinda old and in need of some facelift, otherwise should be quite liveable I thought. I find those units facing the Kallang river or should I say big drain seems not bad .  Got park connector to Bishan Park also not bad . I like smaller and quiet estate so will not consider big HDB housing estates. Those that are far away from town area will also not be in my consideration too, preference would be those along NE line.
 
3. Coming back to Potong Pasir, those low rise units seems attractive. I found those living on the ground floor having a "private" garden amusing. They really planted fruit trees with plenty of assortments of floral. Is this a good or bad thing?   Some even have garden furnitures  ! One big issue is the rubbish chute that is built so near to the unit, I wonder smell and croaches will be an issue or not ?.
 
All comments welcomed. Thank you very much!

Potong Pasir is a good location whereby it's near town and price compared to 
the other nearby neighbourhood like Aljunied, Macpherson and bendemeer. 
 
Another location u may like to consider is Hougang, slightly further up, with ease of  
buying daily necessities. 
 
Ground floor units have the tendency of inviting stray cats visits. since you prefer 
quiet, i don't think ground is suitable for you. Passer-by dragging their slippers, children 
screaming, people talking, strangers looking into your house, etc.

Potong Pasir? I hear opposition ward difficult to upgrade.  But I think conservancy charges should be much lower than other area?  Sorry cannot provide any good advise, I'm not familiar with that area.

1. The block that is facing the river is populated with trees and traffic is near zero. I'm ok with animals, may be I should consider keeping a car for pet .
 
2. I've a property at Bendemeer area but I would not want to live there and be seen by my tenant and old neighbours . Nah, just kidding. Hougang..erm..don't think I like the CTE. By the way, to go to town from Potong Pasir, do I hit more than one ERP? Thank you.

Hi Kelpie,
For me, i will choose a location base on my travelling pattern to work place. As i need to travel to work daily, i need to make sure the route is 'on the way'. 
Example, i stay in CCK (yew tee area). So not near orchard or central, but i am happy because my wife work place in IMM office. I work in CBD area. So daily, i drop-off my wife and drive to my work place. After work, i pick up wife and go home. 
But if i stay near central, i need to drive to IMM then back to CBD. Not convienent. Weekends drive to suntec (example) takes a longer time but i just take it as enjoying my ride.

but dun think i'll move there la.. not for the next 5 yrs at least

I've been living in low rise or landed so I more or less know the associated problem with it. Just that living in your own house, you manage your own refuse whereas living in HDB, the Town council does it for you. Are rubbish chutes in HDB always well maintained, door left open for smell to go away?

I agreed with you that location plays an important part. If given a choice, I would prefer to live in a flat that is located within the CBD area. However, my kids are schooling already so I can't move too far away from their schools. Unless, they're willing to change school .

1. You can put it in a way that it has a potential for further development. St. Andrew Junior, Secondary and JC are there. Primary school kids.
 
2. Clementi, Teck Whye? erm..lets put it this way, I prefer an estate with about 20-30 blocks at most, the fewer the better. East means marine parade? Highly inflated HDB prices there, not worth. Singapore sea view doesn't worth that much to me.

Looking at ur requirement, McNair Road(Blk 108-111) or Jalan Rajar(Blk105-108). Both are next to river/canal and very quiet HDB areas. But they are also very near to the city.
 
Happy hunting. I dont know the prices there, u can ask ard.

Too bad, I don't have a street directory with me at this moment and www.streetdirectory.com is not working too . Anyway, Thank you for the recommendation . If decided to move here, it looks like my girl has to go Geylang Methodist Girl School liao.

Perhaps I can offer a more relevant point of view being a resident of one of the blocks that face the river.
 
My last property was a private one. Looking at over 30 units (all EA or HUDC masionettes), I finally found the perfect one at Potong Pasir. 
 
Yes, at first glance, the estate might seem in need of some refurbishment, but after staying here for coming to a year, I wouldn't want anything changed. The tiles and fixtures might seem to be old fashioned, but they are maintained better than any estate I have experienced, HDB or private. Every 2 weeks, the whole block is jet washed. Light bulb blown? It'll be changed right away. People are generally nice and private at the same time, at least in my block.
 
It is a quiet and charming estate. Unlike most HDB estates, everyone is squashed together closely. But here in PP, there is space. Plenty of space. Not only that, there is plenty of greenery. Right downstairs is the park next to the river. There is virtually no traffic noise. It's even quieter than my ex neighbourhood where there are only private houses all around. You hear birds chirping. Staying on a top floor corner unit, my balcony view is totally unblocked facing the Woodleigh water treatment plant. Doesn't get better than that.
 
It's a 10 minute drive from Orchard Road. Getting back to PP during peak hours may be a little slow as the traffic flow on both PIE and CTE are usually quite heavy. But it's nowhere near as frustrating as when you're living in AMK.
 
I paid $480k for a 2-storey, 1800sq/ft masionette, just before the property prices went crazy. I consider this to be extremely good value for money. I have zero regrets moving here. In fact, I prefer it here to my old private housing estate. The only thing that bothers me is the fact that there is no sheltered parking, and I hate to park underneath trees, which leaves very few parking lots that I can park in.
 
Every week, without fail, I get people knocking on my door to offer me up to $700k for my unit. Then I realised something which I never even took into consideration when I bought this place. PP has got St Andrews kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and junior college. As you know, parents are willing to spend money just to be in the right area so that they can get their kids into the schools.
 
For me, there is no better estate to stay in...

1. Glad to find someone with the same thought and feel for the estate . You rightfully put it that there is plenty of greenery in this estate. Actually my younger boy has not reached the junior schooling age but the gal can always take school bus to school. So schooling is really not that big a concern at this stage. 
 
2. I've the thought that by 2010, there will be plenty of prviate condo & houses to pick from (over supply) and now is a good time to accumulate cash to wait for the next kill to go in. Although, I like PP estate but will not pay 700k for a PP flat, 700K can get you a nearby smaller freehold condo/apt. If someone wanted to buy at that price, I will sell.
 
3. Is it true that the lower floor of those double storey flat in PP has no toilet? So if going to financial district, will have to hit 2 ERPs right? I assume no ERP when on the back?
 
Thank you for your info.

Still can't beat Potong Pasir leh . Close proximity to shop is not in my favour, tend to be noiser. Sigh, yet to find one estate that looks like Potong Pasir, perhaps those flats closer to Kallang river is also worth considering, also newer.

my dad never asked us. i disliked all 3 locations my family stayed at 
 
only now, my wife and i choose, we like the location. 
 
1. Erm...if given a choice, my gal is ok with anywhere so long it has full size pool . It is a matter of give and take lah. I'm trying to psycho her that PP has nice river view and a bicycle track. In addition, a nearby school boy school with very fierce teachers to make things difficult for her younger brother .
 
2. Actually a landed house can also be very run down too. It really depends on the residents living there, what they want out of their precious living quarter in Singapore.

If u dont need next to river, I recomend the ones near Pei Kio CC. Quiet and near city. Its somewhat a forgotten little place. 
 
Pei Kio? Near little india right? near Aids test centre is it?
 
Regards,
 
No lah, thats Kelantan Lane. I am refering to those at Owen Road. Its very near KK Hospital. Go look up the street map at www.map.gov.sg

Why are there so many rubbish there? I visited friends there on a few occasions and I must be lucky enough to see smokey scenes and noisy dances. How much roughly does the place cost these days? Which is a good block to look for? Thank you. 
Regards,

Blk 13 - 14a r d newest block.  Build in 1999.  Mkt & hawker is within d estate.  However, it is currently under renovation.  Shop n save is in Blk 13.  NTUC is juz opp. Kallang MRT facing Sims Ave.
 
5 rm flr size range from 120m2 to 130m2 depending on flr.  All 5 rm units has 4 rms unless owner heck 1 rm.  There is 1 storerm next 2 entrance.  Tis store rm can be heck once approved by HDB.  Price starts from $400k.

2. I've the thought that by 2010, there will be plenty of prviate condo & houses to pick from (over supply) and now is a good time to accumulate cash to wait for the next kill to go in. Although, I like PP estate but will not pay 700k for a PP flat, 700K can get you a nearby smaller freehold condo/apt. If someone wanted to buy at that price, I will sell. 
3. Is it true that the lower floor of those double storey flat in PP has no toilet? So if going to financial district, will have to hit 2 ERPs right? I assume no ERP when on the back?
 
Thank you for your info.
 
Regards,

 
2) If I could sell, I would have sold! $200++k profit with a capital investment of $480k in less than 1 year is good returns by anyone's standard. But HDB rules stipulate that I have to live here for at least 2 years before I can sell.
 
3) Not sure about the no toilet thing as the short blocks do not suit my needs and I did not go and see any of them. Yes, you will hit 2 ERPS's on the way to work. Also 1 ERP on the way back. Irrelevant to me as I work at home (my car is 5 years old and the mileage is less than 30,000km!)

Sound like a reasonable price for a relatively new estate. Will consider it too. Thank you.

Towner is pricey when compared with the flats at the surrounding areas and yet it doesn't have the uniqueness that I'm looking for. The longkang too small for my liking .

1. I'm seriously looking at moving to a HDB unit. But wonder which is a choice estate to live in? 
2. I drove to Potong Pasir just now, I find it quite a pleasant estate though looks kinda old and in need of some facelift, otherwise should be quite liveable I thought. I find those units facing the Kallang river or should I say big drain seems not bad .  Got park connector to Bishan Park also not bad . I like smaller and quiet estate so will not consider big HDB housing estates. Those that are far away from town area will also not be in my consideration too, preference would be those along NE line.
 
3. Coming back to Potong Pasir, those low rise units seems attractive. I found those living on the ground floor having a "private" garden amusing. They really planted fruit trees with plenty of assortments of floral. Is this a good or bad thing?   Some even have garden furnitures  ! One big issue is the rubbish chute that is built so near to the unit, I wonder smell and croaches will be an issue or not ?.
 
All comments welcomed. Thank you very much!
 
Regards,

 
Really depends on wat are your priorites. Do you want good accessibility, abundance of amenities, near town and etc etc? Or you just want somewhere near your workplace and doesn't matter if its near town or not? Does age of the flat matter much to you?

I'm looking for something just like Potong Pasir. Old town charm and look.  Nice location, Got MRT, got nice river scenery, got big and tall angsana trees, got park connector, got good schools and etc. HDB old or new, so long it is near MRT, sure can buy. One more thing, it is an opposition ward and I can cast my precious vote!

That is why living in a landed house in Singapore could be cursed with heat during those hot hot months. It is like oven. But then, there is always air-con. I heard top floor also very hot one.

But if you're living near the last stop of a MRT Line, your transportation expenses also very siong mah. Yes, near MRT but not too far away from Central.

Old town....or not fully developed due to its in the opposition's hands? How bout the schools there? 
U have young kids? Or all grown ups liao? 
 
If u say old town, how about clementi? Teck whye? 
Or u looking for estate in the east?

 
1. You can put it in a way that it has a potential for further development. St. Andrew Junior, Secondary and JC are there. Primary school kids.
 
2. Clementi, Teck Whye? erm..lets put it this way, I prefer an estate with about 20-30 blocks at most, the fewer the better. East means marine parade? Highly inflated HDB prices there, not worth. Singapore sea view doesn't worth that much to me.
 
Regards,
 
Bro, you can try taking a look at the Sunset Way area. I live at Clementi Street 13 off Sunset Way, and it is amazingly quiet and tranquil. Big sprawling area with only 8 blocks in my area, and it's separated from the main Clementi area by the Ulu Pandan canal...
 
Travel is easy - you have 4 main routes (5 actually) to go wherever you want. PIE/BKE is just 5 mins away, so is the AYE. Then you have Dunearn Road and Commonwealth Avenue as well as Holland Road to head to the city.
 
But I think it's rather far away from your current location in the east

Bro, if PP price is a little bit on the high side, here's a place for u to consider....: 
 
Hougang Ave 7..... 
 
HDB masionette (or 5 roomer, old style) / Facing Sungei Serangoon (+ big greenary where you don't see in PP) / Park Connector (3 over KM) / near MRT (Hougang) / near Hougnag central for all conveniences.... quite similiar to PP and also its also Opposition ward....
 
For your concern about CTE...people stay there (since its the edge of Hougang) can use Eunos / PIE / ECP and the new KPE is also coming end of the year....
 
Price wise I am sure is much lesser than PP
 
Good luck for your HDB hunt

I had the same ideas years ago.  This place really cozy and hv the kampung atmosphere.  Have you checked out St. George's?  The other place wld be Shunfu.   
 
Privacy is definitely there cos I approached a family staying there to let me view the house on the ground floor & asked for their feedbacks.  But, natural lighting might be a problem.  That time, the unit I went for a visit was having some construction works in the front so cut off alot of light.  Roaches, rats, lizards, ants, small snakes, frogs, crickets are some of the natural problems faced by those staying on ground floor.   (There are kampung spirit cos ended up a few uncles and aunties came out who was sitting in their backyard came out to share their views on staying in PP)
