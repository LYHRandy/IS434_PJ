Please mention the condo.. their MC will go after the security.  

It depends on the size, prestige and how ON the MC. 

But for your case, you have a unit number to tell them right? So, be their guest.

at one of my former condo, there was this family that came carrying plastic bags, picnic mat, tar-pau food and simply plonked their stuff at the poolside and decided to go for a swim - fully clothed.
 

fortunately the security guards were proactive enuf to notice and stopped to questioned them. true enuf, they were trespassers and were asked to leave.

The security at my friend's former condo also sibeh jialat. When driving in asked me who and which unit i visitng. As i forgot my fren's unit, so anyhow tikum "#17-01, Mr Tan". Guard also didn't counter check, dun know ask for fark. Guard even wrote "#17-01" on the parking slip given to me. Then later in the lift, realised the condo only 14 floors.   WTF!

but since your wife are going there for tuition, means you are allowed in by the resident liao, if the security asked, just tell them the unit number and they can double check with the resident...the security cannot eject you if you are a guest of the resident.

Guard: What you here for?

Robber: Breaking in

Guard: Which Unit?

Robber: Blk 92, #06-02.

Guard: Park in the visitor's lot

Robber: Thanks
 

Is that what they really expect?

No lah, this is Singapore. That only happens across the strait.
 

Here, the guards will ask for a registration fee of $10 (one off, 1 year validity) and $25 (refundable upon return) for the Smart Card Photo ID Access.

  After reading this kinda thread I find ppl in sgp very unforgiving( regardless of whether it's to visitors or security guards) and like to "pick bones in an egg".
 

No need to imagine if the security guard is on the ball ppl will also comprain about it. I think the ppl who comprain the most prefer to stay in a prison whereby security is at its best even for visitors to visit.
 

It's no wonder why some condo residence have so much conflict during meetings. Compraining about the security alone I think will take half a day. Ppl should take a step back, take deep breath, realx and let ppl do their job.
