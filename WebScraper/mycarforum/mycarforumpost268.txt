Don't you feel that HDB should have more transparency in terms of the labour and land costs which go into the building of HDB flats?

Dis was already debated since Teh Cheang Wan's time and until now it's a closely guarded secret. Can forget about transparency where this is concerned.

Guess what I found when I renovated my parents' flat which was built during "THAT" time? The wall cavities round the door frames were all stuffed with old newspapers! 2-3 kilos of it in total . . . . OMG!
 

The guy who hacked the walls told me about it when I popped in for inspection of the reno work, my eyes nearly dropped to the floor.

HDB has already written to straits times many years ago, saying the cost of building one flat is $50k to $75k. Anyway, govt already said, if cannot afford to buy, then don't buy. Nobody forcing you to buy except yourself. The more you know, the more dulan you will be

I read news about housing cost in Taipei. It is 11.1x their family income. Is ours 11.1x or near?

If family income is 50k, the flat will be 555k. 

I think our flat is still not the most ex la.

Under accounting, if a company chut the $ to built the flats, then after that company chut the money to loan the buyers of these flats, and have to wait 30 years to collect back the money+interest, is this make $ or lose $ in accounting terms?

HDB already say they loose money when they sell  you at 300k for 4 rm flat. If sell anymore cheaper, HDB will go bankrupt liao. HDB later dulan, they lease their land out to private developer $600 psf, easily collect 100 million without doing anything, dont have to chase for monthly repayment. later tax the developer again with corporate tax. make second round. Tax the banks that earn the interest from their loans. make 3rd round.

not to confused cashflow and accounting
 

Accounting

cost of goods sold vs loan receviable
 

so accounting wise, it will never be negative
 

cashflow of cos is another side of the story

uncomfirm info was that 1 unit was abt 8K... this was like 20 yo pricing..

now .. i think was abt 20~30K per unit  ... 
 

the rest of the cost are $$ spend on infrastructure...road... multi-purpose hall... lobby... carpark.. etc
 

dont compare the cost of HDB with private condo or apartment.. it was not a fair comparison... one is apple.. one is orange.

Ok thanks. So means HDB accountants all fail one? Cost <$100, sell $300-400K, but declare lose $$$$????? Unless everyone in HDB gets annual bonus 48months and all the taps in HDB office is made of solid gold, otherwise the $$$ go to where????

the worse thing is that the loss was BIGGER (huge in fact) in the years where they only built very very little flats.... I do think the HDB accounting is very complicated.

If they say they make big bucks from selling public housing, Singaporeans will sure complain one ma.. Just like when SMRT makes big money from the so-called 'public transport, people always kpkb about it. 
 

SMRT is a public company while HDB isn't. That's why HDB is not obliged the show the 'true' figure to public.   Their accountants must be very creative to come up with this kind of figure.

The next question we should ask is why must common facilities like playground and other costs of landscaping ... etc be added into our flat price as these are considered public property and anyone can use them, including those not staying in that cluster?
 

The boundary (perimeter) of our unit does not extend there, so naturally all these should not be included in.
 

Flats would have been much more cheaper if the surrounding land cost had not being factored in. True that HDB "buys" the land from URA/SLA, but the residents do not own these pieces of common property.
 

It would be fairer to say we pay only for the part of land on which the building stands on.

Might as well say for the past 10 years LTA had been making billions of losses coz of the dropping of COE prices instead of appreciating from the 100k mark.

Illogical comparison right? If they are so sincere about giving subsidy, it should be derived from the cost of construction instead of market price.
 

Let's look at another case. HDB claims to lose millions from unsold flats in the late 90s to early 2000s. These unsold flats were eventually sold out and at a cost much higher than what was initially offered, not forgetting the tenure was cut short. These flats were sold at a higher price, more than enough to cover the interest. Buyers borrowed from HDB and they again earned another 2.6% in interest of the higher selling price. So now, why are there still losses? Didn't they already recover back even more from these sold units.
 

If we can follow HDB's example of using unrealised profits to declare losses, next time anyone can also open a business and declare losses every year with "unrealised" profits.

I believe there is another thing which not many people knows. Despite the sand ban from M'sia, HDB had managed to go around the ruling. This time by pre-fabricating the parts in M'sia and shipping them in to the site. I've seen M'sian trailers transporting these slabs (for construction of floors) into the site.
 

So again, their construction cost is surpressed again with cheap construction materials and labour from across the causeway.

  a friend was offered to choose a 5 roomers (BTO) at Duxton at around $3500k.
 

he gave it up than because he left his gf.  when Duxton was re-released few years later,  for unsold flats, the price was much higher than the initial price offered at "subsidized" rate.
