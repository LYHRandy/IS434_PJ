Hi guys,
 

Managed to get a BTO. 1st time home owner.

I'm not eligible for HDB loan so i'm getting a bank loan. Need to submit a letter of Offer by Xmas.
 

For the folks using bank loan here, what are the pros & cons of variable rates vs Fixed if u do refinance/repricing regularly every 2-3 yrs once the locked in period is over?
 

There is of course refinancing penalties. 
 

My loan will be ~200k. 

Any constructive advice/prior experiences is appreciated before i go ask arnd the different banks after the wkend.

fixed is more expensive now but cuts out uncertainty when rates rise

variable is cheap now but when rates rise, it gets more expensive
 

fixed allows you to do longer term planning

variable makes you think that you can afford more than you really can.
 

your choice.  anyway, at worse lose a few grand, it's not an end of the world decision even if it's wrong.

as long as you have some cash buffer.
 

good luck to your new advantures and congrats on embarking on a new stage in life

Thanks for ur opinion.

New stage is currently still an empty plot of land with the HDB sign on it 
 

Erm good thing abt BTO is that its "relatively" affordable. Nt worried abt repayment of the loan even if interest rates do take a hike.

If I am not wrong, most banks are offering non-fixed rate now, all the offers and goodies are for non-fixed rates, and the lock in period is between 1-3 years, depending on terms. reason being the rates now are all time low, and the banks expect the rates to go up. unlikely to get a good offer on fixed rate.

Congrats.
 

To be eligible for a bank loan, downpayment is as such 5% Cash; 15% CPF. Max QOF is 80%. Min loan amount is $100k.
 

Max tenor of loan = 70 yrs - Age of the younger applicant with income.
 

The banks would subsidize your legal fees.
 

For fixed rate packages, it is only fixed for the lock-in period. After the lock-in period, it goes back to variable rate. Of course, by then, you can do your repricing within the same financial institution, or refinancing with other banks.
 

However, do note that for uncompleted property, banks would offer variable rate pacakges only. Certain institutions do offer SIBOR/ SOR pacakges.
 

Hope it helps.

My father just took a 800K loan from ocbc, if 3 years lock in first year 0.98%, if not lock in 1.28%.....but for you doesn't really matter because the bulk of your loan will be disbursed in 2015, 2016, by then the whole world may have turned upside down...

but i thought if i lock-in the interest rates now, when the loans get disbursed in 2015, 2016, the interest rates i will be paying will be based on the interest rates that i locked now? 

NO?

Ok let me see if i understand correctly.
 

I purchase the property now in Jan 2012

And I sign up for the loan package now in Jan 2012 for 60%:

Year 1: 1%

Year 2: 2%

Year 3: 3%

Year 4: 4%

Year 5: floating
 

Supposed the first disbursement by Bank to Developer is 2 years later i.e., Jan 2014. 
 

So when I start paying the Bank instalment in Jan 2014, will I be subject to 1% or 2% interest rate? 
 

thank you for the advice.

It will be 1%, year 1 starts from first disbursement.

It is very unlikely that the bank will commit a low rate far ahead of your first disbursement.

Yup, Yardo is right, it will be the Year 1 rate of 1%, assuming the bank did not adjust the board rate in the interim. As your is 60% loan, I think only when they start building the walls then you need disburement.

tomorrow shall need to start sourcing for bank loans liao...maybe can check out Finance coys like Hong Leong Finance as well..
 
 

btw, Sabbie, you mentioned "assuming the bank did not adjust the board rate in the interim".

But if i am able to lock in the rates now, then i should not be concerned right?
 

UNLESS, the rates that i lock in now are still subject to variability, like the one from SCB which works like "1-mth SIBOR + 0.7%".
 

Is my understanding correct? 
 

many thanks again

Yup, if you take Fixed Rate aka lock in rates, then you need not worry about variability, however do note that to compensate for the risk of locking the rates, bank charge higher rates for fixed packages, and some banks may not offer them for BUC properties. Most Banks at most fix it for 3 years and thereafter will adjust it according to their board rates anyway. Also the penalty for lock in packages usually tie in with the fixed period, so this may mean that you are lock in for 3 years from first disbursement. Hence it depends whether you are buying the property with the intention of moving in and staying there or as an investment.

Anyone tried getting house loans from finance coy instead of banks? Some folks told me because finance coy tend to have lesser capital backing, hence may be more stringent and frequent in performing LTV reviews.
 

True?
 

Nonetheless , would finance coy packages be more attractive than local banks?

Or for that matter, how is the comparison between local vs overseas banks eg uob vs Citi?

Not neccessarily true, some banks do not finance certain properties and certain occupation and these people have to go to finance coy, for example when atrium residences was launched with much fanfare at lorong 28, buyers could not get a bank loan and had to go to hong leong, everything else is about COF, local banks tend to have lower COF compared to foreign banks, hence abit slower in adjusting board rate, ceteris paribus

I was told that I shld try to cancel all credit cards n clear all personal loan if I have any now as it will greatly help me to gain approval for my housing loan. 
 

His explanations sounds logical but I still need confirmation on that. His explanations is that the more credit cards you have though u din use at all, might become one of the reason for not getting the full loan as chances is that you may end up using the cards n might and up chalking more debts which may lead to difficulty in repaying the housing loan. 
 

Same as any personal loan which the bank will also take into considerations.

i am no banker. but from what i ask a banker when i was taking bank loan
 

Credit cards bills are not critical. so the number of credit card will likely not be an issue. BTW, me and wife have around 10 Credit card each and still get a loan. (stupid banks. apply 1 card, send me 3 to 5 cards. Since 5 years free. just take lah.)
 

but personal loan might be an consideration.

frankly it's nonsense. it's your credit ratings and your ability to pay which is basically your previous track record that determines everything.
 

the number of credit card isnt even in the equation.
 

pardon my question, but how much are you earning and how much are you looking to loan ? as well as your age... this would actually have higher weightage on how much loan they will disburse.

Pay $5 to get your Credit Bureau report to check on your credit rating.
 

Things that affect the loan approval
 

1) Income 

2) Other debts/obligations - eg: car loans, study loans, personal loans etc

3) Credit credibility - have you been prompt in paying your credit card bills, loans etc?
 

Having 1 credit card vs 50 credit cards has no bearing on the loan approval process.

Credit facilities aside, the first most important consideration in regards to a loan would actually be your income. 

After your income is determined, the next considerations would be your existing liabilities: e.g. Vehicle Loans, other Housing Loans, or long-term loans such as Education, Renovation loans. After these liabilities are established, then the next line of liabilities reviewed will be the credit cards and personal credit lines.

depends on how much you are borrowing vs your salary. If you barely make it, and you have a personal loan + car loan. They may re-consider. Aniway, MAS just announce last wk that they going to check on the banks on their approval process.. so past experience with housing loan may not count. Guess he may be just playing safe.
 

A few mths ago when i take loan, bank say since i am "priority" customer. dun even need to declare earning and can take full loan... so i guess it's time for MAS to step in liao.

hmm.. why you need a 3k loan?
 

but amt is small and never default payment before should be ok.
 

most impt 
 

1. how much u earning.

2. how much you wanna loan.

3. how old are you.

If you can, limit to <50% loan.

30-40% loan would be ideal for those risk-averse.

absolute garbage. whoever told you this is a moron. i do deals from X mil to XX mil. you think my bosses will cancel their cards just to get a loan? banks do not check how many credit cards you have issued either. they dont care as long as you can service their loan - its none of their business.
 

also 80% is standard. some people will take 70-75% to placate banks if the banks think they are a risk. but more often than not, most people get the full 80%. whoever fed you this BS is only concerned about himself ..

depends on his situation. if he takes 80% loan and uses his free cash (and say makes 10% return on that, or even 5% - he will still come out on top)
 

if you are young, go for the 70-80%. rates are pretty low (i just negotiated 0.7 + sibor for someone). make sure the lock in period is low (ie 1~2 years is fine) i managed to get 1 year only for a friend. make sure you ask for a lump sum prepayment clause (with no penalty) so you can pay down the loan in tranches if you have spare cash and you feel interest rates will rise. therefore, you can still sit on your cash in case you need it, or if you feel market is shaky, you can pay the loan down at your convenience.

MAS audits banks' home loan practices



 

again bro .. i've never heard of a banker asking someone to cancel credit cards to secure a home loan. i deal with 5 different banks, some on a daily basis and some on a weekly basis. 
 

so say Ts is getting advice from Bank X. how will bank X verify that the credit card under bank Y has been cancelled? 
 

have you ever gone into a bank and they said, please show me all your credit cards form different banks so we can verify? they cant, unless you give them explicit, written permission, to ask another bank regarding your credit details.
 

anyway, i could be wrong, or we dont have the whole picture from TS .. but this is literally the first time i've heard of such a thing ...

(that article came out because MAS told banks to stop with the legal fee / valuation subsidy btw)

Some local and foreign banks are having their home loan lending practices reviewed as part of added scrutiny in the light of the booming property market, sources say.
 

The audits are being conducted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and will apply at both local and foreign banks.
 

Experts say the move is likely a way of sending a signal to banks that the Government is keeping a close eye on them, and they should remain prudent in their lending practices.
 

Mr Roger Tan, chief executive of Sias Research, said the central bank could be looking for signs of lax lending without due consideration of the borrower's credit worthiness. .....

 

the article is printed last wk lah.. so i think all the banks now very careful liao. Not surprise that banks will add in new rules over the last few days with regards to credit worthiness..

For other loans, since mas not checking.. i think banks not so "stress" ... 

Aniway, if TS not borderline case, i dun see why banker is asking him to cancel all his cards / lines. Then again.. if TS dun have 3k to spare.. it goes to say alot abt the cash position that he is in.

absolute garbage. whoever told you this is a moron. i do deals from X mil to XX mil. you think my bosses will cancel their cards just to get a loan? banks do not check how many credit cards you have issued either. they dont care as long as you can service their loan - its none of their business.
 

also 80% is standard. some people will take 70-75% to placate banks if the banks think they are a risk. but more often than not, most people get the full 80%. whoever fed you this BS is only concerned about himself ..



 

Bro, notice that TS has personal loan of S$3k. 

If personal loan is such a small amount, likelihood very borderline case.  

So in this case, they might look at outstanding credit facility as well.  

I am no credit officer, but it doesn't look far fetched.

with current low housing loan interest rate vs CPF interest rate, it is logical to loan max and keep the money in CPF. get a mortgage agent to help you to calculate the difference.
 

high loan % does not mean a bad thing unless you don't have money in cash or CPF, then it is very dangerous. when interest rate goes up, you don't have money to bring down your outstanding loan, your monthly installment amount goes up. waiting for it to come...

makes sense also, thats why after reading your post i said Ts may not have given us the full picture  though i would assume someone who is looking for a housing loan would have sufficient liquidity before embarking on looking for a loan in the first place, but you're right lah ... having 3k outstanding when getting a housing loan sounds strange ...
 

otherwise normally, no bank will ask you about this ...

By right, unsecured credit (i.e CC) is only supposed to be 2 x monthly income spread across all banks right?  
 

Meaning by right, if monthly income is $5k, then add together all credit cards shouldn't be over $10k - 
 

But NOBODY ever follow this....

yup .. my first credit card was $10,000 limit .. and i wasnt even qualified for half that amount at the time .. 
 

a few weeks ago I was at MBS, and the woman in front of me literally took out a photo album of credit cards ... must have been like 30-40 cards (im not shitting you) ... banks these days issue cc like water

not bank dun follow.. cos' they have excuse not to follow as they are not able to access customer data outside of their bank. so how to follow... 
 

same if you default $0.20 and you default 20k.. bank only see default in the bureau record if the default is of another bank. So make sure you dun have any. 

Some bank count bonus,then, divide into 12 .. so bank dont. Whether they consider CPF credit into the contribution also very grey.  Aniway... if mas call them up, they have their ass covered.. believe me..

If I recall correctly last time when I apply mortgage they asked for outstanding loans (including credit card). 
 

As we clear full balance every month, just write $0

Oh guys... Maybe is my fault for providing insufficient info.
 

Ok that time I took the loan cos i wana buy something that I like and that's the only personal loan I am servicing now. 
 

The rest of the credit card bill I clear every mth promptly except for afew times due to overlook but clear immediately. 
 

As for the canceling of the credit cards was told by the housing agent to me not by the banker that's why I need more clarification from the banker or any bros who work closely with bankers for more info.
 

Well for me, I'm in my early 40s' and my agent told me that he had submitted my docs to the bank and preliminary chk shld be able to loan up to 830k but if I wana loan higher I shld cancel all my credit facilities so that to keep a good credit records that the banker will consider.

Assuming single borrower, your annual income should be in the range of approx 80-100k. 

If your monthly installments are >40% of total gross pay, even if you clear the personal loan, you will not get a higher loan. 
 

In your case, very likely the CCs and the personal loan will not have significant impact.

my advise, just do anything you can to make your finances look better.. i think bank/mas may have intro this rule to prevent to ppl for getting the excess cash through cc / cashlines..
 

and since the announce on the audit is last wk.. i dun think anyone .. even bankers can advise you with certainity ( except those guys at MAS) .

not that clear. could be 830k is less than 80%. that's why he's asked to cancel credit cards to up his margin coz one can't get more $$ if they are oredi on 80%.

aniway.. i think TS is caught by the latest rules since he's already 40+. He can take only <20 yrs of loan. 

So the projected mthly instalm goes from 3k+ (35 yr)to 4k+ (20 yrs) ...or 40% downpayment.  not forgetting interest rate now still low.. If it shot up, TS will die flat...
 

In any case, we also dun know under what circumstances TS is buying his new million dollar home.. abit bad for us to pre-judge him. but i personally feel that TS shld drop the idea.... super high risk.. if no cash buffer.

in his 40s ... i would assume he some additional cash buffer (i hope so TS ...!)
 

while int rates are cheap now ... 1% uptick could probably hurt you a lot.
 

after taking the loan, make sure you have enough cash for daily expenses AND at least 2 years worth of installments. if something bad should happen and you say, lose your job, the bank will automatically get jumpy ... lol

I do have a lot of credit cards... I sign up cos got free this n that. But in actual fact I only use my posb for everything n my uob for petrol. 
 

I never defaulted any payment at all but still servicing a personal loan of 3k plus. Never defaulted any payment too. 
 

So I'm right to say is ok for me to ignore him right?

You should have no problems, like other bros have mentioned. Btw, if using CPF, it should be okay. AT MOST, you gotta top up a little bit in the future if they calculate that your CPF ain't enough.

Maybe, maybe not . That we don't know. Some people spend all they have, some people save all they have. 

I based on 830k Max borrowing, and 40years of age(25 year loan) and roughly 40% loan repayment ratio to arrive at annual salary amount. 

Assuming all numbers are correct, shouldn't be too far off.

with current low housing loan interest rate vs CPF interest rate, it is logical to loan max and keep the money in CPF. get a mortgage agent to help you to calculate the difference.
 

high loan % does not mean a bad thing unless you don't have money in cash or CPF, then it is very dangerous. when interest rate goes up, you don't have money to bring down your outstanding loan, your monthly installment amount goes up. waiting for it to come...




CPF interest after you liquidate the property is still your money ... for re-investment, savings, or otherwise.
 

Bank loan interest paid up is lost to the bank forever!

Ok the 3k loan is actually a credit card hire purchase and now left with 2.6k after checking with bank.
 

The 830k loan is base on both me and my mrs income.
 

Yes I'm getting a condo and cost 1.1million.
 

830k shld be enuf but just to play safe so my agent says try to get higher and see how.
 

If base on 1.1mil and 830k loan, I still have 110k cash on hand and that amt can't touch as is meant for emergency use such as if bank int rate goes up, that will b the cash that I can tahan till the 4th yr when I can sell it if I want to. All calculated base on very high int rate growth that means the worst scenario and if mkt turn against me where my yearly refinancing fails. And also assuming our salary dig not go up!!!
 

Of cos minus the considerations that both me or my wife will go jobless!!!
 

If need to factor this in, guess I have to stay put in my current unit.
 

So I guess all this info sufficient rite?
 

If all this credit facilities will not affect the bank decision guess will leave it.

aiya... timbuktu.. cpf $$ too small for you to take notice lah...
 

cpf is paying 2.5% interest.

bank loan is charging 1.0x%. 
 

that is to say if you keep 100k in the cpf and borrow 100k more from bank.. after 1 yr, cpf pays you 2.5k, an bank charge you 1.0xk . You earn 1.xk by keeping $$ in cpf.
 

if you had paid the bank 100k instead. That will mean you lose that 1.xk

just be careful not to be caught. like i say, except mas guys now, no one can tell you that bank will not up your loan amt based on you terminating all your credit facilities.. so i think you shld heed the advise and do it if not too much of a trouble.

It's not the $quantum ... although that could still be significant, depending on loan principal, tenure and (potentially rising interest rates).
 
But why 'donate' your money to the bank at all?
If can, should minimize that 'leak'.
Am not saying don't take any loan at all hor.
 
Especially right now when interest rates are still low.
Just make sure tie-down period is as short as possible and contract allows you an escape clause for full/partial redemptions w/o penalty.

Ok the 3k loan is actually a credit card hire purchase and now left with 2.6k after checking with bank.
 

The 830k loan is base on both me and my mrs income.
 

Yes I'm getting a condo and cost 1.1million.
 

830k shld be enuf but just to play safe so my agent says try to get higher and see how.
 

If base on 1.1mil and 830k loan, I still have 110k cash on hand and that amt can't touch as is meant for emergency use such as if bank int rate goes up, that will b the cash that I can tahan till the 4th yr when I can sell it if I want to. All calculated base on very high int rate growth that means the worst scenario and if mkt turn against me where my yearly refinancing fails. And also assuming our salary dig not go up!!!
 

Of cos minus the considerations that both me or my wife will go jobless!!!
 

If need to factor this in, guess I have to stay put in my current unit.
 

So I guess all this info sufficient rite?
 

If all this credit facilities will not affect the bank decision guess will leave it.



 
 

actually, that 110k will not be of much help. sorry bro - im just being realistic here. you didnt mention stamp duty - so not sure if you factored in 33k + legal fees + valuation .. which should come to 4-5k.
 

if by year 2 interest goes up 1%, your property value *will* fall. if you dont meet the standard LTV, you will be asked to top up, failing which, the bank will foreclose. (not to be too pessimistic, but most banks here normally try to help their clients anyway .. foreclosure is really last resort.)
 

it looks like you may not be able to sustain a 10% drop in valuation though ... because that will leave you uncovered. and if prices do take a 10% dive, its highly likely it will stay that way for a while before going back up...

other than 110k cash on hand
 

you have other investments that are a few multiples of that 110k

Ok guys... Guess I will turn this thread into another topic..
 

Assuming if I getting xxxk of loan and on hand I will have xxxk of cash on hand.
 

Let's assuming I need to stay here for at least 4 yrs...
 

For the 1st yr, everything manageable. 

2nd yr onwards till 4th yr I need to fork out cash as cpf not enough base on increasing bank int and assuming refinancing fail.
 

At the end of 4th yr, I still have 30k cash on hand approx base on worst case scenario.
 

Do u think is ok to proceed?
 

Take note: this is minus the possibility of losing the job, no changes in our daily expenditure but zero luxury items and no salary increment.

brother, no offense ah (this is the financial guy in me talking and id rather be straight forward since i do this for a living)
 

your furniture how? renovation? property tax goes up? your toilet leak into below floor unit (law says upper floor guy pays .. can range from 2k -10k depending on severity)
 

if your worst case scenario is having 30k on hand with a property with nearly 20 years repayments to go ... boy... thats some dangerous waters right there man. (what int rate did you use to calculate WCS?)
 

did you take into consideration your outlay for stamp duty, renovation and furniture?

Well cos I never bother to look into all this and is my first time buying a Pte property as all along I'm staying in hdb...
 

To me how much a person knows not depends on his age is how well he is being exposed and his willingness to ask and learn.
 

Cos in the past to me is not a possible dream so I dun bother to think and dun bother to ask.
 

Well tat means I can now? I dun know that's why I wana ask now....

Bro, we took only 35% bank loan for my last property purchase, when I was younger than you now.

Max CPF ... which I will get most of it back (excluding minimum sum) when I turn 55, if we sell.
 

Now house is already fully paid up, title deed in hand and many more years left to retirement  
 

Other investment properties bought with cash + minimum bank loan.

Can liquidate any time w/o penalty.
 

Got burnt only once with an Oz property, in downcoming market, rising interest rates and forex firming toward the AUD (my salary is mostly still in SGD). Foreign property carries more risks when you don't have time to manage it, or employ an estate agent.
 

Life lesson learnt: manage your risk exposure, starting young.

Be kind and considerate to all people EXCEPT the banks!

They won't care when your stakes are turned ... they'd just want their money back!
 

Conversely, I creamed 5-6% from the banks in FD interest, when I parked ~$1M after liquidating one property in 1997/8 just begfore the AFC (heng ah!). 

The feeling was bliss

Bro thks for the honest remarks... I'm ok with direct and heart piercing remarks esp this concerns $$$$ and my life...
 

Well stamp duty all factored in but did not factor in like toilet bowl leak Reno and furniture....
 

Bro pardon me again of I say anything wrongly...
 

If I really need to think till the extend of losing job, disability, toilet bowl leak etc.... Guess I can't even afford a 400k 4 room flat... 
 

Yes the risk factor is far more lower but what I meant is that over cautious like will make us not moving forward right?

I am in the same shoe but i am only willing to take $100k loan

its not that ... i'll tell you frankly .. sometimes i will get calls from the bankers i work with and it will go something a long the lines of bank foreclosing property on some guy and offering to their other clients (who will swoop in like vultures). i went to such a sale 3 months ago. guy had a 2.5m apt, did reno half way, and had a margin call. bank forced him to sell the house because he couldnt raise enough cash. it was sold for 20% below val ... so bank protected themselves, but wiped out like 700k + of his equity like that. and i've seen this happen a few times.
 

you basically need to ensure you have set aside cash for *any* eventuality, regardless of what it is. that is the key to the property game - holding power. if you dont have holding power to tide you through some minor ups and downs, you may not own the place long enough to see the actual appreciation. 
 

basic reno + furniture will normally cost you what .. 40-50k? which means you will be bearing the burden of having less cash ma.

I do have a lot of credit cards... I sign up cos got free this n that. But in actual fact I only use my posb for everything n my uob for petrol. 
 

I never defaulted any payment at all but still servicing a personal loan of 3k plus. Never defaulted any payment too. 
 

So I'm right to say is ok for me to ignore him right?
 

Thks.




You ask your banker again. 
 

Did he mean you need to pay off your outstanding rollover credit card balances? 
 

Do you have any installment plans or rollover credit card balances (meaning you don't pay in full)?
 

Whatever monthly loan installment you are paying right now will reduce quantum of home loan you intend to take if the sum total exceeds 40% of your pay.

3 ways to look at it...
 

a person that is willing to take risk will tell you go ahead
 

a person that is willing to take calculated risk will tell you, maybe can maybe cannot
 

a person that is not willing to take risk will tell you not to do it
 

so which are you?  
 

for me, i will say condo price now too high i rather wait as i assume you should have more than 110k after selling your exsisting property

Bro.. need to factor in lah.. not young liao.. cannot take risk like before.. if you have children even worse. 

1999, One relative sell his flat ..make fat profit.. buy 1 condo then buy 1 landed.. at 40+.. 

in 2005, almost bankrupt... lucky got another wealthy family member willing to give him million. ( that relative also not thinking of getting it back)  

luckily, 2009 property pickup.. but i dun think the million he lose in the landed which he sell already.. so the relative never get back anything.. 
 

if i were you, i will either do nothing or..if you want to ride on the pty wagon, sell and downgrade to cash out.

Like that fully paid a 3-rm , with some spare cash.. and wait to buy an investment unit. Worse come worse got 1 small house to stay.  Pte pty.. may touch.. but not in million range.. maybe 400-500k loan still can afford.

no need to sell and downgrade. status quo for the time being loh. just save up a little bit more la bro .. and you'll be fine. or target something slightly cheaper? 
 

one caveat ill tell you ... i know a guy who bought a property against everyone advice. everyone told him the numbers dont work ...
 

and yet, 3 years later, the property price went up 150%. so if you have your heart set on it, figure out a solution lo.
 

(like one of the bros mentioned, you didnt say how much exactly you will plough into pte property frm your current place ... or did i miss that part?)

2 factors i think for your relative
 

1) he sell 1 flat, to buy 1 condo and 1 landed.. i will term this as speculation or flipping assuming the only profits came from the flat and the rest remain status quo.

2) the asian financial crisis which cause the sharp dive in prices.
 
 

but what TS is doing is merely selling one to buy another... i would term this upgrading instead... fear of continue rise of private houses prices thus unaffordability, a change of enviroment, maybe even a change of status may all be a reason for changing...
 

therefore i don't think there is a co-relation between your relative and the TS...
 

my personal view... i may be wrong though

If ts is 30s, earning 80-100k. Okay , he's upgrading.

At 40s , earning only 80-100k ( combine yrly income) and buy a 1.1 mil house with almost full loan and little cash. If prices does not go up in 10 years. I dun see how he could afford the mthly repayment. So it's speculation.

think carefully & do due diligence before purging into the property market. if u r now 40 yrs old, with cash on hand 100K (if purchase) less legal fee, stamp duty, valuation, property agent fee, renovation (if any), furniture, car loan (if any), maintanance and not forgetting inusrance for home and medical bill (costly) assuming in the next 10 years health no problem. also not forgetting children if any.
 

assuming the max loan is 25 years or whichever come first. the 1st 10 year of installment is serviving interest payment and thereafter reducing balance of principal. in short,  if u were to sell your property less than 10 years your selling price must cover 1.1M+ interest expense 200-300K. breakeven 1.4M. provided your location is not ulu. if your intention is to flip in the next 2 to 3 years then no need to think too much.
 

if you think the next 10 years can ride out, than go ahead. I have a collogue sold his 5 rm sengkand flat and bought a landed property 1.1 m both hus + wife working with 2 children+ car, see them living on the edge if one lose job, not sure what to do except to said sell his house in anticipation of capital appreciation.  what if down trend, then how? he said then see how?
 

i really dont understand why people want to rush and buy property, got money anytime or with more saving can buy property anytime. this is like borrowing money to speculate share or margin financing. margin call how? sell at a loss but with property unlimited loss cause it is illiquid asset no buyer and tightenting of MAS ruling  & people with cash will wait for lelong lelong or Great singapore sale.

your friend can rent out 1 or 2 rooms to supplement his income if necessary 

cash on hand can not beat inflation 

a property will never have unlimited loss. your max loss is the purchase price + interest but even then you still have a roof over your head

how about you write into Straits Times and correct them? All along, they termed people who sell 1x HDB and buy 1x condo as HDB upgraders. Maybe you should convince them that these people should be "correctly" termed as speculators.

your contingent planning is to rent out 1 or 2 room , but how much can u cover 1400 to 2000. at this price can rent out 3 rm flat pending on location.  the new condo flat room quite small. i am not too sure renting out is really a good idea unless it is a whole unit.  further more if this situation arise, i am sure there are many borderline people will be doing the same, driving the price down further of the property and rental as well.

I am talking about your friend who bought a landed property..... a landed is not a condo. 
 

and the rental should start now and not only when there is problem 
 

no matter how low the price,  it still supplement the income.... beggers can't be choosers

think his friend is okay lah... 1.1mil for a landed.. i think now sell shld be able to cover and more.. 

then again, dun know how much renovation loan he take to re-do the house.. ha ha ..
 

landed rental abit tricky, cos' location normally quite ulu since it;s 1.1mil i think dun think it's near bukit timah mrt... think rent out room for $500-600 also may not get any tenants..
 
 

i seriously think ppl that buy EM for crazy price is crazy. 20+ yr old house liao.... wait government enbloc .. they will have to "suck" thumb.

think ST assume that they are at better cash position.  
 

aniway.. i am not against buying pte or upgrading.. i just think that TS is over leveaging considering his cash position.
 
 

In any case,  if want to buy... can wait 3-6 mths.. there shld be some effect on the resale mkt based on new MAS ruling. Those >50 yrs investors that took up 80%/35 yrs loan and rent out their investment properties may not see decent rental yield that can cover their mthly instalment when they re-finance.. these guys will drop up if they dun want to put in 20% more cash.

Ok guys... Guess I will turn this thread into another topic..
 

Assuming if I getting xxxk of loan and on hand I will have xxxk of cash on hand.
 

Let's assuming I need to stay here for at least 4 yrs...
 

For the 1st yr, everything manageable. 

2nd yr onwards till 4th yr I need to fork out cash as cpf not enough base on increasing bank int and assuming refinancing fail.
 

At the end of 4th yr, I still have 30k cash on hand approx base on worst case scenario.
 

Do u think is ok to proceed?
 

Take note: this is minus the possibility of losing the job, no changes in our daily expenditure but zero luxury items and no salary increment.



 
 

let's just do a simple sum here
 

$1,1000,000 condo unit
 

you need pay 5% cash------$55,000

stamp duty--------------------$27,600 (can use CPF, but pte property need to pay cash first)

lawyer fee---------------------$3000

renovation---------------------$20,000 to $30,000 (depending on what you want to redo)

furniture------------------------$10,000 to $15000 (depending on how many you bring over)
 

so total cash outlay is about $115,600 to $130,600.
 

now you have a loan of $830,000, that would means you need cpf of $215,000.
 

if you have cpf more than $215,000 and cash of $130,000 you are on track to the purchase.
 

than you look at your monthly payment, the max now you can take is less than 25 years (you in early 40s), assuming you take a 23 years loan, your monthly repayment sld be in the range of $3200-$3300 a month. Do you have that much CPF (OA) coming in each month? 
 

do not forget the management & sinking fund you have to pay each month, and PUB is usually higher in pte condo.
 

base on 80% financing, sld be $880,000 (but you said you had a $830,000 loan), are you saying that you have an IPA and not a actual letter of offer? take note that is the IPA a cfm IPA or is it a IPA subject to credit clearance. If you already have a cfm IPA, than what ever cards you have does not matter anymore. But if it is IPA subject to credit clearance, it is too late to cancel any card anyway. 
 

Different banks will assess your credit differently, if you need more loan, mayb you can try afew banks and see what is the loan each bank is prepare to give you.
 

Just my opinion, if both have been working and in the late 30s to early 40s, combine cpf sld be in the range of $400,000 to $500,000, you sld not be looking at that much a loan. If combine CPF less than $300,000, and in 40s, this is a very big risk you are taking.
 

Ok these much I can share, hope these helps.  [:)]

sorry to hijack the thread but i have a question - 
 

Now if i am planning to settle down but is unable to purhcase any govt housing as well as EC due to the ceiling, will it make sense to purchase a private condo or resale hdb? this is a purchase for occupation, not investment. 
 

currently the cov is almost 40 to 50k....there isnt really much choice available.

this one really depend on what you want bro, different ppl different thinking mah.
 

If EC is also out than of course BTO also no need think liao. Pte or resale HDB depends on what kind of lifestyle you want, and how much cash you prepare to come out with, doing a simple comparison.
 

if you want space, cheaper maintenance, and some rebate from gov during ang bao session, go for HDB.
 

if you prefer the facilities, underground car parks,  a condo name as an address, go for pte condo.
 

actually it is really quite stupid to think about it sometimes, that buying a HDB may seem cheaper but the cash up front can be higher than a pte condo because of COV, but if you are first time buying and using HDB loan to buy a resale HDB, I think no need 5% cash ( not sure if it still stands). They will take all your cpf and loan you the balance, which means you only need take out cash for COV, which is abt the same as 5% bank loan for pte condo.
 

Usually pte condo no much renovation to do because flooring and fixtures are quite standard. Resale HDB depends how well it was done up and how you like the renovation. Either you pay high COV for a well renovated unit where you do minimum touch up, or pay low low cov for a super "lock" unit and spend money do it all up. Don't go for those no3 no4 until where you pay high COV and yet have to do alot of reno.
 

Of course paper profit and losses on Pte condo will always out do HDB, which means on upside condo increases faster than HDB, same goes to downside. HDB belongs to gov, so even if anything happens to you (in term of credit), nobody can touch your HDB, unless you owe HDB years of installments. Pte Condo, bank can force sell your unit if you default too long, because the bank owns your unit actually...
 

otherwise, HDB is 99 years, most pte condo now also 99 years.  [:)]

normally bank would do a DSR (Debt Service Ratio) to measure ur ability to pay monthly installment. basically is u have car installment, they will include in this consideration. credit card not a factor unless you have bad record in paying ur debt. ur personal loan not a big sum, so would be no prob. basically they see ur income and age which is more important

U may have a bad record. Go to credit bureau website n get a copy of your own credit report to understand what went wrong first.
 

DONT cancel your card first, because for example, if a person had a very long outstanding payment with bank X, and for June got a rating score of C.. Even if cancel the card the fully settle the amount, and never have outstanding amount, this C score from bank X stays for 3 years and banks will always reject credit application due to this.
 

But on the other hand, if u dun cancel bank X card while setlle all outstanding, and hold on to the card for another 12 month, this C record will be overriding. 
 

That's why paying $5.35 is important so that u keep the cards with bad records to clear the bad records. Alot of people does the wrong opposite ways.

Everyone have mentioned about the financing aspects about upgrading. I must say this is the worse time to upgrade reason being the increasing gap btw HDB and condo. For example in the past if HDB cost 500K and condo $1M which is about double. Now if HDB become $1M and condo become $2M, it is also doubled but the absolute amount is huge, in this case is $1M compared to $500k
 

Secondly, due to the SSD, if you need to sell the property for whatever reason and for whatever price, you have to pay tax. For example u moved into the condo and realise u dun like your neighbour or u dun like yr new place. Even if u sell the place at the same price in the next 6 mths, u will lose 16% or $160K for a $1M property. So u are locked into your new place for 4 years. How long is 4 yrs? can serve NS twice already
 

Policy risk is also very high. Each time a cooling measures come, those who bought earlier will think they are lucky coz they managed to "escape". Putting into an perspective, it means with each cooling measure, the pool of buyers decrease. When less people buy, prices will also more or less stagnant as the upside is not there. The upside is capped but what about the downside? What it means also is that u have bought at the PEAK!! Congrats to those who have recently escaped the cooling measure by buying before oct 6.

To be honest guys.... Is to fulfill a dream... 
 

Well one can say what so great about condo?
 

Is not about the facilities not about the status... Is about the concept n design of the building where you will never find in hdb.
 

Is is too exp to realize this dream? Yes I agree it is and the risk is there...
 

I foresee this shld be my one and only chance...
 

If I miss it I won't get to do it anymore.
 

I can get a 25 yrs loan cos is base on my wife age who is younger than me.
 

I think no one can understand what is a dream n desire to own one.... I know I know... The risk is like if the mkt turn against me that's the end !!!  
 

That's why is a struggle between sensible and insensible thinking.
 

For those who are already there good for u. A lot of my colleagues commented that is a risk n keep saying what's so great about condo?  Well... Maybe blame me for not studying hard when young..... Lol

Actualli, $1.1M for a condo nowadays is considered beri minimum liao. 

At the end, you're buying your own home. There'll always be green-eyed colleagues who will look for the negative in the success of others. Ask yourself if these same ppl are very successful in their own finances. If not, why need to bother abt what they say? So dun let that put u off. 

Based on what you've said, your capital outlay seems ok. Can't comment on the affordability as we dun know ur personal finances but guess any 40+ would know better themselves whether it is. 

But frankly, u seem to be looking at things thru a half-empty glass. Solely from that angle, i tink u better dun buy as you'll not be able to sleep peacefully in the new condo.

Juz my 2cts worth.

Actually there is really a diff...
 

There are certain things you can't find in hdb..I'm referring to the architectural design...
 

1 example will b full height windows for living n bedrooms.  Does hdb has such features? Yes only a handful and location might not to ur liking...
 

Then is this worth it? To pay 1.1M for tat design? Well in life we peruse diff things n what I'm looking for in my house are all this....
 

But will really seriously consider all corners as even I myself feel tat is a high risk move.

since it's a dream then I don't see why not? 
 

there is a certain element of risk but I don't think is as high as what most described 
 

of course everyone wish to buy something with little or no risk but not everyone has this luxury 
 

as long as you had done your calculations and you deemed it not too much of a stretch, i don't see why not?

Having a dream is one thing but how expensive is the dream
 

Why u say the timing can only be now? You still own a property and is not renting
 

Sometimes the things u wanted very much can make u excited for few months only. Car is one good example. Ask those who bought the car of their dream. After a few months, the novelty will wear off.
 

Btw about design, sometimes getting a HDB looking at the beautiful design is better than staying inside. Just like buying a nice car but u dun get to see yrself driving the car as most of the time u are inside. it is those who see u driving it think it is nice. haha
 

One last thing, the novelty last few months or many few years but the loan last 25 yrs

I disagree in certain aspects. 
 

it's a house,  something that you stay in,  something that you spend at least 1/3 of your life in. if it was a car then the answer will be different. 
 

yes I also agree the price is high now,  it should drop but who are we to say it will definitely drop,  TS is afraid he may not be able to afford if prices continue to rise. what if it really rises and he keep lamenting that he should have bought it now.. gonna be a very unhappy man
 

i think the most important part of buying a house is feeling comfortable in it. if he continues to stay in hdb when he feels he can still afford a condo at current price, i don't see how he can be happy in his current house. there will be regrets. 
 

my personal opinion

which pty are you intending to buy? does the property has possible upside ? is your risk migiated by a unit that is easily rent out. Or say potentially high capital appreciation. 
 

i mean.. if in the event, something "bad" happened, you still can rent out the unit and pay the mortgage for a while. While family and you can rent cheaper accommidation. 
 

If you are buying a 4-5 yr old, good location FH condo unit at 20% below valuation for 1.1mil, i guess.. even with a poor cash position, your risk may not be as high as some of us has projected.
 

To me, eveything there is a cycle.. prices will go up and will go down. To believe that price will never go below buy price.. is almost impossible over the next 20 yrs.. but.. i believe FH pty will go up by at least 50% at some point in the next 20 yrs, LH99 not so sure because of the decreasing lease...Holding power is very impt, if you dun have good cash.. then you need to make sure the unit can "make" $$ for itself.

nonsense...the most impt factor is whether u are having any outstanding loans and whether have you defaulted or late for CC payments. It's not about how many credit cards you have.



 

Nonsense, making comment without knowing the fact.

By right, unsecured credit (i.e CC) is only supposed to be 2 x monthly income spread across all banks right?  
 

Meaning by right, if monthly income is $5k, then add together all credit cards shouldn't be over $10k - 
 

But NOBODY ever follow this....




Usually max for unsecured credit is 4x monthly income (credit card+credit line). If income above $100k per annum, max is 10x monthly income

I disagree in certain aspects. 
 

it's a house,  something that you stay in,  something that you spend at least 1/3 of your life in. if it was a car then the answer will be different. 
 

yes I also agree the price is high now,  it should drop but who are we to say it will definitely drop,  TS is afraid he may not be able to afford if prices continue to rise. what if it really rises and he keep lamenting that he should have bought it now.. gonna be a very unhappy man
 

i think the most important part of buying a house is feeling comfortable in it. if he continues to stay in hdb when he feels he can still afford a condo at current price, i don't see how he can be happy in his current house. there will be regrets. 
 

my personal opinion



 
 

There is a joke before saying that some people will buy very big and expensive house but they spend most of the time outside working for to pay for the house and it end up is the maid and the dog using the facilities and enjoying the house. Upgrading is a good thing but the timing now is really not suitable due to the special circumstances. No doubt people are still buying as they are afraid prices will still increase. The rate of increse is already moderating in the last 2 years. It is not going to suddenly shoot up another 20% then nobody can afford to buy already. The unique thing about property unlike stock is that there is a upside limit. The property price must be supported by the income of the people. If the prices increase until everyone cannot afford, it is a bubble and not sustainable. That is why developers are reducing the size of the unit to keep it affordable of below $1M. If they build 1500sf 3 bedroom at $1200psf, it will cost $1.8M, how many can afford it? But 1000sf at $1200 of about $1.2M, then maybe can still stretch a bit
 

Stocks can rise 50-100 times but property cannot. People make more money in property than stocks in the past is becoz of leverage

Nobody know for sure if it will go up, maintain of drop but think independent, what are the odds of each? Upside higher or downside higher.  
 

Hope these sharing can help TS decide better. Cheers

To be honest guys.... Is to fulfill a dream... 
 

Well one can say what so great about condo?
 

Is not about the facilities not about the status... Is about the concept n design of the building where you will never find in hdb.
 

Is is too exp to realize this dream? Yes I agree it is and the risk is there...
 

I foresee this shld be my one and only chance...
 

If I miss it I won't get to do it anymore.
 

I can get a 25 yrs loan cos is base on my wife age who is younger than me.



 

Frankly that is the mentality of those people who bought recently. The government should do something about this. More stronger cooling measures. People are thinking that the prices will not fall ever to affordable levels and it is either NOW or NEVER....
 

I think property bubble is always fueled by speculators in the beginning, and at the tail end it is the "normal" people who have given up hope who joined in.... needless to say, these people are the ones that die when the bubble burst.

Back in post-AFC 1998, I went to view a resale condo unit.

Owner asking for sky-high price, way above market rate, even higher than the more-prime prime D10 FH units at that point.
 

Later, I pulled the agent aside and asked him whether owner is crazy or what?

Gave him comparative prices of units in better, more-prime locations being advertised ... agent was fully aware, of course, re the unrealistic asking price.
 

This was the agent's answer to me:
 

Oh, the owner had bought this unit at the peak, before the property bubble burst with the AFC.

So he now wants to recoup his paper loss ... so he is asking for this price to at least breakeven.
 

WTF?
 

The owner is trying to pass on his entry-timing 'mistake' to the buyer and walk away scot free.

Now, is this the mentality of SGeans dabbling in the property market, never wanting to lose and always expecting to make a profit from buy-sell transactions?

Interesting to note the pros of stocks compared to property.
 

Property has many pros too:

- every peak is higher than the last. When can stocks recover to it last peak price?

- property is tangible and can rent out even when price is down. It is possible to lose everything in stock.
 

With low interest, QE3 and Sgp population increase, how can property price drop? Even if it drops, the demand is there to prop it up. Looks at the market. Last but not least, it is not the intent of latest measures to drop the price, but to try to curb the price from surging.

If there is true demand, then the rich will get richer. Of course if no holding power better don't buy.



 

yup its true....those who have holding power will buy.....either for rental yield...owner occupation....or for the price to rise psf in the future....

yes the richest and the millionaires or the billionaires in singapore invest in property....in singapore.....such as far east organization....
 

but for overseas like in the united states its other businesses such as technology and software.....as such is the difference in the economies of scale....

owner could have bought at the wrong time.....anyway there will be cycles in property....2007 was the expansion stage...all the way till now.....
 

even buy private or condo now quite risky in my opinion.....but for hdb em owners to sell their property now seems like a good option...
 

but if you are rich down the option to purchase money....and exercise the option in 14 days....no one will say anything......

Can anyone help ESP bankers...
 

I was told that I shld try to cancel all credit cards n clear all personal loan if I have any now as it will greatly help me to gain approval for my housing loan.



 
 

This is true... Even for commercial loans...
 

Of course, if your financial is strong w/o any bad ratings, then the above will not go agst you. Therefore whenever you have annual fees incurred, must call banks immediately for waivers. Else you might take it for granted, it snowballs and affect your ratings.

Yup this is called anchoring in psychological term. They will anchor the "value" of their property at their purchase price. I think sometimes people lost touch of things in absolute basis but more of an relative basis. I know one investor who lost money wonder why he lost money coz he bought his property close to valuation. Just becoz u are buying at valuation does not mean that is the right price
 

So did the seller finally sold his property? Or he only managed to wait till recent years before he can breakeven. More than ten years before breaking even. Sometimes i wonder if there is no cheap money from 2008, will the suburban market ever recover or will it still be underwater even after 10 years? Those who bought Bishan then now only breaking even. Factor in interest cost, i think still lose money

Yea, the commoners are always the last to join in the party and it always pop in their face coz there is no more people to buy from them. it happen in stock market also. people wun buy when it is cheap but will only buy when price are increasing or when headline news say prices are increasing. Then people will panic and rush in to buy.History always repeat itself but people never learn. COE also same thing, property price also same thing.. When price drop a bit and rebound, people will declare prices wun drop coz drop a bit everyone will rush in then convnice themself this is the right time and right price already...

yup still got seller stamp duty of 16% in first yr for private property....and HDB must meet MOP of 5 yrs b4 selling...
 

so u have to ensure yr property appreciates by at least 20% or even more for private....

If ts is buying a property within his means, I guess since it will his home for the rest of his life. Then it really does not matter if the value goes up or goes down. If he sold at a lost , it just losing some $$ . Sell low buy low. There is no real impact to his life. But if ts is buying something that look like beyond him, then if he could not keep it during a down turn , it will be serious trouble. He's not young 40++. Chances of getting a pay raise def not as high as having health issue and big pay cut. 

Sorry for being blunt. Cos see and hear so many examples Liao.

Ok guys... Guess I will turn this thread into another topic..
 

Assuming if I getting xxxk of loan and on hand I will have xxxk of cash on hand.
 

Let's assuming I need to stay here for at least 4 yrs...
 

For the 1st yr, everything manageable. 

2nd yr onwards till 4th yr I need to fork out cash as cpf not enough base on increasing bank int and assuming refinancing fail.
 

At the end of 4th yr, I still have 30k cash on hand approx base on worst case scenario.
 

Do u think is ok to proceed?
 

Take note: this is minus the possibility of losing the job, no changes in our daily expenditure but zero luxury items and no salary increment.



 

Actually my view is that if you have enough cash to put 40%-50% down, u are very safe. 

My very personal view is that property prices unlikely to lose >40%. 

Cos that would be massive financial tsunami to Singapore and the Singapore banks. 

A 10-20% correction i think would be well within general expectation. 
 

So, in your case, 20% down, 

You need to 
 

1) keep 18 months intstallments somewhere. 

(Either CPF or cash)
 

PLUS
 

2) have 220k in cash. 
 

reason for 

1) Temporary unemployment. 18 mths should get you/your missus another job. So you can keep up with payments 

2) drop in property price >20%, where you will have to top up your LTV. 
 

Do note that this the contingency only for your house. Not taking into account other day to day expenses. 

My honest opinion is that this is a little stretched for you. 

Can afford, but only just. 

Try to work on a budget that allows you to pay installments on one income. Less stress that way.

Bro, i always tell my clients, you will always know when you feel that you are taking too much risk. 

How? Sleepness nights and peace of mind. 

If you can sleep soundly at night with no worries after buying the condo, please go right ahead. 

If you can't (and you sound like you are worrying right now) please don't. 

You stay there also wont be happy. No point. 

Peace of mind is like the best (mental) fengshui. Priceless, IMHO.

At the end of the day, LUCK matters. I took a $4xxk loan when I started work for one year with an income of around $3k/month. Wife was studying for PHD.
 

Probably a stupid decision at that time, 2001, but it turned out to be a good decision. 
 

so who knows... I did have sleepless nights (discussing about the housing loan) when the interest rates was like >4%...

Just go in and see see lor. I think normal people will just go and see see no matter what is the price. Just to see the layout,facing, etc.

Just like buying new cars.

In fact, more are going for luxury brands due to perceived better value.

maybe that's you but I prefer not to waste each other time...  15mins to view but trip to and fro adds up to more.. 

and most importantly I don't see the need to bitch of the price if you already know the price or don't bother to ask about the price 
 

I have to disagree about normal people..  more of  boliao people 
 

my personal opinion though

Back in post-AFC 1998, I went to view a resale condo unit.

Owner asking for sky-high price, way above market rate, even higher than the more-prime prime D10 FH units at that point.
 

Later, I pulled the agent aside and asked him whether owner is crazy or what?

Gave him comparative prices of units in better, more-prime locations being advertised ... agent was fully aware, of course, re the unrealistic asking price.
 

This was the agent's answer to me:
 

Oh, the owner had bought this unit at the peak, before the property bubble burst with the AFC.

So he now wants to recoup his paper loss ... so he is asking for this price to at least breakeven.
 

WTF?
 

The owner is trying to pass on his entry-timing 'mistake' to the buyer and walk away scot free.

Now, is this the mentality of SGeans dabbling in the property market, never wanting to lose and always expecting to make a profit from buy-sell transactions?



 
 

well..........willing seller..........willing buyer.............
 

who would want to sell at a loss if he is not in a hurry to sell...............reasons can be plenty............and do you really believe in what an gent tell you???................lol
 

you may think it is a crazy asking price............but if you were in his position......who knows you may ask for more...............ppl are shouting that S$1m HDB is crazy............S$200K COV is crazy.................yet ppl are buying..........so who is carzy???...........
 

I once took 3 months to sell my unit ( I was looking at more profit not breakeven).........agent kept telling me you are trying to sell at record price...........I just told him if cannot sell nevermind.............in the process i had 6 offers............all rejected till the last one............$10,000 more than my asking price..........

No need lah.

See the house first. If price is right, buy.

If not, wait out month after month, as market gets crippled (like in 1997 AFC), cash-strapped owners will keep dropping their price.

Then you reel them in like fish kenna sangkut!  
 

They will implore you to seal the deal, at your price ... when push comes to shove / bank margin calls.

Just make sure seller loses in forced / fire sale in such downturn transactions.

They will be at your mercy.
 

During a buyers' market, cash is king.

Current situation is unsustainable. When there is up, there will be down. Prices cannot rise forever. So who thought they still can earn quick bucks by speculating on housing market, my advise is look at what is happening around the world before commuting to decision. Up to individual choice, get hands burn also oneself  fault lor.
 

I am surprised by news keep reporting of record housing prices, record cov, but never focus on bubble is already forming. All it take for financial crisis to hit and thats it, and it will happen quite soon, already some sector in sg already feel the heat and stop hiring people and wait till US presidential election is over, than will see..

Actually my view is that if you have enough cash to put 40%-50% down, u are very safe. 

My very personal view is that property prices unlikely to lose >40%. 

Cos that would be massive financial tsunami to Singapore and the Singapore banks. 

A 10-20% correction i think would be well within general expectation. 
 

So, in your case, 20% down, 

You need to 
 

1) keep 18 months intstallments somewhere. 

(Either CPF or cash) <-- this i assume he doesn't have since he has a HDB or not chances of someone taking 80% loan is low if CPF has a certain amount , expecially if he is in his 40s , should have quite alot one.
 
 

PLUS
 

2) have 220k in cash.
 

reason for 

1) Temporary unemployment. 18 mths should get you/your missus another job. So you can keep up with payments 

2) drop in property price >20%, where you will have to top up your LTV. 
 

 <-- This i kinda of agree on the amount though i think roughly 300k would be better , he mentioned 110k which i think it is too little to dabble in property, especially in current property prices , any drops in housing prices , the bank immediately ask you for top-ups , if you fail to meet , they just liquidate. It is in the terms and conditions. One must prepare at least 10~20% of the property price for such cases , at your age , chances of job stability is pretty important , banks would be worried if you are able to repay if you lose your job since finding work might be difficult at your age.
 

Do note that this the contingency only for your house. Not taking into account other day to day expenses. 

My honest opinion is that this is a little stretched for you. 

Can afford, but only just. 

Try to work on a budget that allows you to pay installments on one income. Less stress that way.
 

<--- my personal view , if one has problems repaying a 3k personal loan , i think they shouldn't be thinking about buying private properties in millions. Expecially when the TS seem to be earning barely enough to sustain the loan. On the credit point of view , i will make life difficult for these people and try to reduce my loan amounts. As for the credit card thingy i think it is bs.

Half bull lah
 




Can anyone help ESP bankers...
 

I was told that I shld try to cancel all credit cards n clear all personal loan if I have any now as it will greatly help me to gain approval for my housing loan. 
 

His explanations sounds logical but I still need confirmation on that. His explanations is that the more credit cards you have though u din use at all, might become one of the reason for not getting the full loan as chances is that you may end up using the cards n might and up chalking more debts which may lead to difficulty in repaying the housing loan. 
 

Same as any personal loan which the bank will also take into considerations. 
 

Is it true and if yes, shld I go thru the hassle of canceling it?

Just a neutral point of view . Dude belittling others doesn't make you any higher class , by the way how do one make millions telling others things on hindsight? 
 

So how many millions do you make every circle to consider yourself "upper" class? I have met people which makes billions and yet they dun talk like you , make millions nia talk like some big boss. People spend millions every month also don't whine like u. Make millions EVERY CIRCLE meaning in a few year talk like this. 
 

Come leh show me your money , tell me how many properties you have and where , i believe people here are interested to know how much "richer" you are , from the way you are to belittle others. Or are you just another internet warrior?

there is good reason why you were banned....perhaps this time, it will be forever, and when u come as a clone, u will be eradicated time and again!




OK lah, I respect moderator.

Cool.
 

But definitely not to all these wannabe-riche keyboard warriors, whose houses atually belong to the banks (they don't even hold title deeds  ) and their cars are really long-term rentals from banks (some even up to full 10 years   ) ... 
 

yet want to come into MCF to boast.  LOL!
 

OK will stop ranting. OT.

Though not targeted at me , i would like to say this. The Malay ones is actually quite fun . I always enjoyed in since young , they are noisy at times but it is part of Singapore's culture. 
 

My view is that someone is getting married , we should be happy for them.
