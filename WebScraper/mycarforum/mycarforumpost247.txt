as above, do note that the source of getting this flat is from HDB Sale of balance flat exercise.
 

Means, its way below market price + no COV
 

Direct purchase.
 

Just curious what you guys might feel about this deal.

pros:
 

cheaper price as compared to resale

reno is done and if you like it, good for u
 

cons:
 

if flat is repossessed, it's highly likely the owner had $$$ problems = Higher chance he might have contacted loansharks = possible harressment
 

* remember the loansharks only recognise the address of the NRIC and not the actual person who is residing there

My unit was repo-ed by HDB from the previous owner. High floor, unobstructed view.

No major issues other than getting my letterbox stuffed with debt claims from loan companies.

Called up the loan offices and they stopped mailing.

I got it at a 25% discount as compared to the resale price at the time, so it was all worth it.  

Unit was quite runned down though, so had to do a full renovation from scratch. Upside is everything is new and the way you want it thereafter.

I guess I'm lucky there is no loansharking issues... (but someone posted somewhere that all you need to do is paste an ownership document on your main door to get them off your back?)

So, no, I don't mind at all. Worked for me. Savings is substantial.

Hi, saw your reply to the subject on buying HDB repossessed flat. Do you mind sharing how did you get to buy your current unit? Did you participate in a balance of sales flat exercise? Hope you can advise me. Thks in advance.

I thought sale of balance flats were referring to BTO flats that were originally allocated to successful applicants that somehow got disqualified during the process. Please advise if i am wrong. Thanks

Loan shark concern is relevant when previous flat owner didn't have a clean debt record.

Experienced the harassment before, sigh.  The concern is valid.
 

But everything finally turned for the better.

Would you rather stay in repossesed house or murder house? I would think staying in repossessed house is ok.

Murder house is definitely a no-no.

Although many of us would say staying in murder house is a no-no. But i believe all those murder house eventually also will have people stay. Dont think you will find one murder house will vacant forever.  
 

Sometimes staying in resale flat also will have problems with loan sharks, if you doesnt know the background of the previous owner. So not necessary that repossesed house confirm will have loan sharks problem.

Long ago sold to someone, and the house has been occupied for decades since the murder happened.

Well before so very much longer people will be staying in houses built on an old cemetary - and I bet they will be very popular with the great location they have.

Adrian Lim's house in Toa Payoh has been featured a number of times in ST. The family that lived there after Adrian Lim is a Catholic family who knew the history of the house when they bought it.But they've stayed there for the longest time without any trouble whatsoever despite the flat's gruesome past. I remember the articles in ST showed pictures of the Adrian Lim flat juxtaposed against the current place to show the stark contrast of the then and now. The once dark, altar and deity-laden flat has since been transformed to a brighter and more cosy flat. 
 

I suppose there will always be a stigma attached to a place once there's some especially negative history about it. I grew up in that same Toa Payoh neighbourhood at the time of the murders and I remember every parent was on edge about their child's safety especially after news of the murders broke, that along with the disappearance of the 2 boys at Owen Road, who remain missing to this day.

Staying in flats built on cemetary is different from staying in flat which a gruesome murder has taken place la.

Aside from homes where murder took place, I guess the more superstitious people would also be wary of houses that used to be private 'temples', or perhaps even homes where suicides have occurred. On the more extreme level, I know some people are also even wary of homes where people have passed away (e.g. old folks) in natural circumstances. 
 

Personally, I think the main concern for a repossessed flat would be more of debtor/loan shark issues. These would be more difficult to deal with physically as it involves animate 3rd parties and your neighbours, as opposed to spiritual elements where at least there are spiritual means to appease/contain them.

Dont think you will know whether the flat has people passed away in natural circumstances. Sometimes even suicides you might also cannot track. Maybe only those very gruesome murder case or major suicide case like the ang mo kio family who suicides with whole family, then you might be able to know.
