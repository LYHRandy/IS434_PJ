Should I max out my CPF repayment (to cut short the HDB loan repayment period) or save some for future downpayment should I buy another property?
 
I've asked around but opinions differ.
 
Any advice appreciated!

if you are talking about buying private property, do private developers allow the use of CPF for downpayment?
 
if you are talking about buying another HDB, then might as well max out your payments, since you cannot concurrently own 2 HDBs.
 
 
for me, i will keep about 6-8 mths worth of CPF to cover my payments should i be jobless, and use the rest to downpay and reduce my principal loan.

short term - save for rainy days
long term - save for 2nd property
 
i short term - clear quite a lot
medium term - save for rainy days
long term - now not enough for 2nd property... need to wait 5-10 years :-(
 
mistake mistake, cos never crossed mind for 2nd property tat time.  but now looking at how cpf is locked in until dunno wat age, i think better to throw into 2nd property, then rent out.  tis is wat i call unlocking cpf into cash!
 
so do keep some money in cpf.  enough for short term 2 years installment, long term downpaymnet for 2nd property.  the rest, u can use to clear.

Before you purchase HDB flat, "divert" some funds to purchase unit trust, shares or gold.
 
Even when HDB empty your OA a/c, you still have buffer for rainy days.

This $60k rule is applicable if you want to invest.
 
If you used for housing purpose, then this rule does not apply.

If you max out your monthly repayment, your CPF will be empty for years to come. What happens if suddenly you are unable to repay the monthly instalment? They will ask you to cough up cash, otherwise they reserve the right to kick you out. Therefore, it's better to maximise the loan duration so that your CPF can grow and buffer for rainy days.
 
Btw, if you want to use CPF for second property, you need to meet the prevailing minimum sum in your Ordinary Account first.

care to elaborate based on the following scenarios:- 
 
after sale of flat (1st time owner, direct fm hdb), must the proceeds be returned to cpf accts, the minimum thingy be locked in and the balance then can be used for (bearing in mind both owners are below 40yrs old) 
(1) resale downgraded flat 
(2) resale upgraded flat (do we still enjoy interest rate of 2.6%??) 
(3) pte property

If the cost of the loan is much higher than the returns of the remaining CPF balance that U hve , then it is good to it that CPF monies to pay off the loan.
 
This is current market, it is not really the case.  take for example. if u are 30+, you are likely to take more risk in investment. So may be use the balance CPF monies to invest for higher return. take a very simple scenario. 
 
you have 50k hdb loan balance , u have 10k cpf balance accumulated over the last 5yrs. 
What do u do with it? pay off the loan to reduce to 40k or invest the 10k hoping the return is able to offset some of the loan interests that u are paying for the loan? 
ie. if your HDB loan is 2.6% interest.  and there is an opporturnity to invest your 10k to get a decent 5% return.  
what would u do ? (i would invest the 10k). :) 
 
 
Should I max out my CPF repayment (to cut short the HDB loan repayment period) or save some for future downpayment should I buy another property? 
I've asked around but opinions differ.
 
Any advice appreciated!

Thanks, I was actually thinking of using my CPF balance as downpayment for a second property. If like some bros mentioned, it cannot be used for downpayment for private property, then it will make more sense to invest the balance like you said.

Provided no paper loss, that is if u sell ur flat above valuation, all proceeds below valuation will go back to CPF, any balance above valuation you will get to keep as cash.
 
1) Yes, u can buy resale downgraded flat, but u can't loan from HDB cos it's a downgrade. Bank loan is the only option, and bank loan sucks at 5%. If you decided to downgrade, i suggest u pay off everything with your proceeds and cash from your first flat
 
2) For resale upgraded flat, u can loan from HDB, interest rate still remains at 2.6%. Bear in mind, bigger flat means you get lock for another at least 25 years. Resale market is crazy now, cash above valuation  can buy u a 1.6
 
3) Pte property, only bank loan of cos. Pay the downpayment, no need reno, move in  straight. Bear in mind, it's a half million loan at least. Floating bank rates. Think carefully. You wanna work like a slave to a pigeon hole if u can choose not to?

So my reasoning is correct?
 
Beware there is another cap, I think you can only use up to certain percentage ( I think it is 120%) of the valuation of your flat using CPF money. Meaning, if you flat worth $300k, you can only use up to $360K CPF money, the rest need to pay cash.

Whatever the others are saying , bro, I think you better stick to paying your loan to HDB after maxing out your CPF. The more you pay the less will be the interest you need to cough out. You'll be very shock to know , if you calculate, what HDB is getting as interest for the entire duration of the loan.
 
If you do not have the REAL means, do not be greedy and or try to invest in another property.

Estimated: CPF pays 2.5%, HDB charges 2.6% (difference of 0.1%)
 
Now with the increased interest earned on the first 60k CPF balances, don't be in a hurry to pay down your loan.
 
Keep some buffer (u decide on the amt u comfy with) in case you jobless
As you are on mortgage insurance, if u kick the bucket(touch wood), the insurance will cover your share of the loan obligation, so you only need to worry if u jobless or kenna long term illness.
 
The above does no apply if your loan is from bank.

Second tat, this is capital repayment, most ppl tot the longer the loan stretch with hdb the better, the same concept abt 10 yr loan for cars, worst still with cash rebate and overtrade. If can, stay within comfortable zone.

so if u take a risk as investment... the repayment amt + interest rate may eat into the profit. 
 
also. there is a HDB charge up to 25% for resale of 2nd flat.

Yah understand ... but I was thinking of using my CPF balance as downpayment for a private property, so it's a matter of balancing the remaining loan interest and saving up enough CPF for a second property.

Yah that's what I thought too ... but I somehow think that I should repay the loan asap if I am able to. At least I remove one loan off the liability list.

if i were to have enough downpayment for 2nd home (pte), i wld buy it and rent out hdb...there is extra few hundred dollars profit after deducting the monthly rental from monthly HDB payment though i may need to top up few hundred dollars more...this HDB rental revenue can cover my pte flat monthly installment...but guess the timing is not now...coz property price is at peak...but i forsee at least 20% correction in year 2009 after IR hype fever.

Hi,
According to your plan, you will probably need to fork out 5% cash and 5% cpf to buy your pte property and loan 90% for 30 years (I assume). 
 
Assuming you loan 500k for the pte ppty, you will probably need to pay 2.5k per month. Your hdb flat, assuming 5 room, will fetch 1.2 - 1.5k. So every month you need to fork out another 1k min plus any maintanace fee. Then you will have to pay eletricity, tax, etc for both property. This will continue for the next 30 years.
 
Pls consider carefully before you proceed. (But if you earn >10k a month, then it will be ok)
Go to Gasgasgas's profileGasgasgas38 posts
hi, think need to fork out 10% cash...cpf is not allowed for first $60K.
 
For 500k property, need to fork out 50K downpayment + 10K stamp/legal fees + 10K furniture/etc...so about 70K cash total..and not including some buffer in your bank a/c to save for months where there are no rental income...100K income for this investment approach would be comfortable.

If u are not buying a 2nd subsidised flat from HDB, need not pay the resale levy.

assumption: your flat is purchased as first timer and loan is 2.6% from HDB.
 
if u feel better when u pay down the loan with CPF, go right ahead, but leave some buffer.
 
but if u paying by cash and have other loan liabilities at higher interest rate, then pay down those first.

oooooooooo
i just clear off my HDB loan within less than 5 years of buying the flat .
 
overall estimate, i let hdb makan 13% interest of $80,000 (5 years) loan instead of 75% interest of $80,000. therefore roughly i save 62% of interest which calculate about $50,000 from going into hdb coffers.
 
btw....i hear more and more people start to cash out their hdb early which might prompt some elites to suggest having an early settlement penalty.
 
let say 1 person per day cash out their home and save $50,000. in 365 days $18.25 million will not be in the coffers.
 
why i'm so goondu to cash out my home? cause in future if my medisave runs dry for what ever reason, they can take it from my ordinary account to top up for all i care.

Yah understand ... but I was thinking of using my CPF balance as downpayment for a private property, so it's a matter of balancing the remaining loan interest and saving up enough CPF for a second property. 
 
The rule of the thumb is...when it comes to investing in other properties besides the one you are living in...is that the roof over your head has already been FULLY PAID UP.
 
Trying to balance between paying for both properties is extremely risky.
 
Usually those who invest in other properties do not depend on their monthly earned income or job.
 
If you don't fall within this category ,then you better think carefully before you proceed.
