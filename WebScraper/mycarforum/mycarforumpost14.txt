I wonder what are the profiles who would rent in areas like Pasir Ris? It's awfully far from other parts of Singapore? 
Where do they work? What do they do and why would they rent there?

Can I ask the other way round? 
Must understand the market before i get that space to rent out.

The airline crews are closer to the Tampinese, Bedok and Expo area right?
What are the employee profiles in Changi Business Park? I was aware many of Indian expats like to live in Simei Rise and East Coast areas.

Workplace proximity is just one factor.
 
For some people, it’s the lifestyle that the location offers.

There is an Overseas family school there and some expats who work in airport/Changi Biz park will housed their family near to that school.
 
This is in addition to the other tenants who work in Changi Biz Park and the surrounding area.

Just be honest!   No market.  You are considering because it is cheap.    Buying that area is the same as buying a lousy stock and then rationalise the purchase and incur opportunity costs of better returns elsewhere.
 
Changi Biz Park Do Not have so many expat to fill Tampines, Pasir Ris, Tanah Merah, Bedok houses. HDB owners also renting out their rooms and house to compete.
 
The lifestyle of the east is D15,  NOT Pasir Ris, no way.  Don’t suggest Pasir Ris Park and downtown east etc, pathetic.
 
For investment, you must be joking.
For home stay, can consider, because you are first to board MRT when going to work.   But coming home,  stand all the way. 
 
For retirement home, ok.

Oh I think you must be living there to know it so well.  
 
Yes it's cheap. I check the URA rental caveat it seems the registered rental for the units are quite good, maybe there is some kind of in-elasticity of price and the clout of many many units there. Then I suppose in a oversupply rent tend to fall.

one of the main worries of renting out unit ....
  Condo tenant allegedly cohabited with BF in secret, owed rent, and trashed room when asked to leave 
A woman alleged that a female tenant to whom she rented out the master bedroom in her condominium to had secretly cohabited with her boyfriend, and owed her two months of rent. 
When the single mother confronted the tenant over the matter, she reportedly shoved her aside, prompting the owner to call the police.
The tenant and her boyfriend were forced to vacate the premises, but not before allegedly trashing the place. 
The incident happened in a private condominium unit at Serangoon, reports Lianhe Wanbao.
The owner, Ms Xiao, 33, told the paper that after she gave birth in December last year, she moved out of the apartment to stay with her relatives. 

She decided to rent out the master bedroom in the condominium.
Prior to that, she had already rented out the other rooms in the apartment, and there were three existing tenants.
Ms Xiao said that she leased out the room through a website, and a 20-year-old private institution student later responded to her advertisement.
The two agreed to a monthly rental fee of $1,500.
Said Ms Xiao:
“At that time, I clarified that that only one person was to stay in the room, and she agreed to my demands.”
However, the other tenants later complained to Ms Xiao, alleging that the tenant had brought home her boyfriend home and the two were cohabiting. 
Ms Xiao confronted the tenant, but she denied the accusations, saying that her boyfriend was only there to visit her and did not spend the night there. 
Between February and March 2018, Ms Xiao found that the tenant did not transfer the rental fees to her bank account.
Upon asking the tenant, she discovered that she had given her the wrong bank account details. 
Ms Xiao said:
“She (the tenant) said that she would ask the bank back for the money, and return the rental fees to me.
“I waited until April but I still did not receive any money. 
“She did not pick up my calls either, so I went down to the apartment to look for her.”
Ms Xiao said that the tenant refused to let her into the master bedroom when she showed up at the apartment.
When she took out her key to open the door, the woman reportedly blocked her entering and even pushed her. 
Ms Xiao added that the woman’s boyfriend was inside the room at that time. 
Ms Xiao lamented:
“I had no choice but to call the police.
“I wanted them to move out immediately, but a police officer told me that I could not just kick them out, so I had to leave first.
“When I went back to check the room after few days, they were already gone.
“I was shocked to tears when I opened the door to the master bedroom.
“The entire place was trashed.
“The cabinets and floorboards were all damaged.”
She estimated that the repairing the damages could cost up to $10,000.

Poor owner, must use some tactic when dealing with problematic tenants. What tactics can one use to make it a win-win ending? 
 
How can one give wrong bank account when receiving rent, how does one avoid such mistakes?

The dangers of DIY landlord... 
Usually my agent will check three times that the deposit (minimum one month) goes through before finalising the TA. No way for wrong bank account to happen.

what are the popular areas the Indian expats like to inhabit? I knew of Melville Park, Bayshore, Mandarin Park at east coast, Little India. Where else? 
 
What are other areas with well known concentration of particular ethicity or nationality? I am trying to know and trying to avoid buying into one.

Almost all areas got occupants or owners from local or foreign country, India, China etc. if can afford to stay at condo their back ground shall be quite ok right?
