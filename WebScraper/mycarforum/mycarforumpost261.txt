Hi,
 

I would like to seek advice on HDB, 2nd private property and loan due to the new ruling.
 

a. should i redeem full hdb outstanding loan ($50k) using cpf. then, i can get 80% loan for 2nd property?
 

b. should i not redeem full hdb outstanding loan ($50k), use cpf oa (after mininimum sum) to pay 2nd property + 60% loan?
 

my hdb interest is 3.8% and cpf oa interest is 2.5%. it makes sense to redeem the outstanding loan because cpf oa is compounding interest on principal accumulation and redeem outstanding loan can save the remaining years interest.
 

if i do redeem, this mean i have to fork out more cash for 2nd property downpayment as cpf oa balance is not much after full redemption. the decision to buy 2nd property is not very firm now and it could be another 1-2 years time or never.
 

What do you think ?
 

Thanks !

Bro, at first instance it would be good for you to pay you HDB in full.
 

that leaves you with less cash and you are looking at buyin 2nd property with 20% dp, you need to ask yourself why you are buying.
 

as it seems, you are buying for investment. 20% dp will not give you any cashflow in today's rental market.

if you are buying for capital gains, do ensure that you have at least another 20% sitting nicely in the bank for emergency.  in the short run, you need liquidity as the market is going no where the next 5 yrs.
 

i'm just writing off my thoughts so it may not make too much sense. pardon me.
 

if there is one advice i can give now to folks of your category, it will be "stay out"

you cant afford to be holding a second property that gives you negative cashflow at peaking prices and tough regulations
 

if i read your financial situation wrong, pardon me.

but i am thinking for your well being.
 

or maybe i'm too kiasee

yes indeed you in the exact same position as many young 30 - 33yr olds i know.
 

if your intention is to rent out hdb, there is no need to pay in full anyway.
 

DP 40% for your 2nd property, would be better.

but if after the DP and you got little cash left, it's also not good.

you never want to be in a position where you can be squeeze.

especially not for current prices.

monthly cpf contribution + hdb rental income should be sufficient to service the 2nd property (ie: condo) and most probably give me some spare cash every month.

say your hdb $2k rental

and our cpf max usuable for property $700

that gives total $2700 cash for covering second property loan of about$600k

just nice , forget about spare cash. if any left will be insignificant.
 

by the way, what can $800k get you currently, in terms of mass mkt condos?

as long as ur hdb rental income can cover ur monthly instalment, you're cashflow positive. and since ur hdb loan balance is so little, the rental income derived would prob be able to subsidise ur 2nd property's instalment. that's good debt and nothing wrong wif servicing 2 loans.

You have missed the boat. Based on currently ruling, even if you have met the MOP and purchased a condo, you must continue to stay in your hdb flat.
 

Do not try to use the "lock one room up" technique. Its illegal.

3.8% is high. Why not pay up fully? Even if you dun get anything later, at least you have saved on interest rate.
 

I also understand that you need a minimum sum in the CPF to pay your second property with CPF, dunno is it 60 or 80k.
 

DO check it out with an agent first.

1 Jul 10, $123k (prevailing minimum sum), $61.5k (1/2 of the prevailing minimum sum = set aside = cannot touch) 

1 Jul 11, to-be-announceed

i would suggest that u wait for opportunity now. i just sold one of my properties, felt so much better to get rid one of the loan. future is unknown, cash on hand is certain for sure  
 

once right opportunity arises, it doesnt really matter whether u pay with 20% or 40% with 1 or 2 loans. now is just not the time. having said tat, u only have 60k outstanding loan? even with 3.8% i dun think will have much impact.

yes ..... waiting for opportunity.

just wondering whether it's a good idea to use CPF $60K to redeem HDB outstanding loan or use CPF $60K for downpayment of 2nd property.

if redeem, then can take 80% loan if not can only take 60% loan because of outstanding loan for 1st property.

60/80 percentage loan difference of a 1M property means need to fork out additional $200k cash upfront.

I made the assumption that if u redeem your loan then you may have less than 61k in your CPF account. Thus unable to finance your next loan with CPF, I am probably wrong.

If really want to stay in the condo, how about selling the HDB and buy the condo, reducing much debt.
 

Although prices to buy are still quite high and not much upside in next few years. The selling market of your HDB may also be correspondingly "high".
 

How old are you? If near to retirement age, can sell HDB, downpay the condo and set enough aside for full CPF minimum sum withdrawal.

no this is not new control measure.

I dont know the actual figure. could be higher.

I usually pay up to $700 from my CPF so never bother to check what is the max.
 

but they wont allow you to use all $900 of your monthly CPF contribution to pay for mortgage.

a small portion from monthly contribution must be kept in CPF.
 

However, if you have a lot in your ordinary account, you can always use that in your monthly.

In other words you can use $10,000 per month for mortgage if your ordinary acct has sufficient 

I'm just splitting it up for the purpose of a cleaner calculation for this discussion.
 

sorry if i confused anyone.

this i also agree.
 

it may not be wrong at all to cash out, swop to private.

own just one property and hold some cash for liquid investments.

and prepare to buy 2nd property when ready.

Bro only $60k , just redeem it.
 

sometimes it's not only about money but also about convenience and simple personal accounting.

thats why i like to buy my things with full cash.

after that , no need to think about anything, focus on the next thing.
 

redeem it, i support you (morally)

Since redeeming the existing loan will cost you lesser,  I will redeem the existing HDB loan 1st, and pay lesser downpayment for the new property.... with the extra $$$ on hand, that will give you additional room for error if something wents wrong. 
 

Property investment is one of the good long investment in SG as our land is very limited and the price will only go north in long term, even if there is any major econimy crisis, you can expect the property price to be stable compare to any other form of investment. look at the statistics, i dont think there is anyone who suffer losses by selling his/her HDB flat if the unit if hold for more than 20 yrs (even when u factor in the interest, stamp duty & etc).
 

to play safe, which ever way you intend to do it, make sure that u have buffer for 1 yr for your monthly installment (either 1 or both property).

If both affordable, I choose option b  

Not sure about what's the value of the 2nd private property you intended to buy, but I assume 20% should be a huge amount (no joke) compare with your outstanding 50k. In terms of property, outstanding 50k is very small amount.

If our loan is more than $700, bascially it will become very risky for the bank (please exclude the CPF from your bonus/AWS).

I will suggest you to go for option A..

getting a 2nd property is definitely a wise choice provided if you are ready to own one or more.

I suggest you to fully paid your 1st property, save up enough before you move on to the next properties.

that's my POV. cheers.

I will suggest none of the option.
 

Since you planned to stay in current HDB, why redeem when i think HDB has a scheme whereby 1 party dies, the mortgage is fully paid?

Not too sure about HDB, for private, you need to engage laywer to fully redeem your loan. Its not just walk into bank kind of deal.
 

As for private, i think prices are sky high today! I dont think it will fall drastically but i think better to do a wait-&-see strategy now. 

Dont believe what agent will tell you now. And if you are taking substantial loan, think twice. I say think thrice for now.
 

If you have bought any pte property 5-6yr ago for investment, you are easily looking at 100% return now. But these days are gone. Many buyer now 

tap on this little fortune they made on new launches. They are afterall cash rich and invest from their past profits, fine. Pity are those jumping in with 

huge loan thinking that they too can catch wave.

that not how a bank assesses.

for monthly instalment, the bank expects you to use cash to cover what is over and above your CPF contribution.

the assessment is base on your networth and current/future income as well as stability of cashflow
 

Like for me, I cant borrow, becos wipe table is equivalent to unemployed for most banks...   boo hoo hoo

another thing to take note, when government suka suka up the minimum sum, your Available Housing Withdrawal Limit (AHWL) is affected. 

thus, you may need to top up in cash to service your monthly housing loan. and, while you grow older your CPF OA percentage contribution also goes down

I am not sure about the ruling but $700 make sense also... because CPF only decuct 20% from the first $4.5k of our salary (employer cpf forget how much...) which mean our monthly OA contribution is $900++ max. 

If our loan is more than $700, bascially it will become very risky for the bank (please exclude the CPF from your bonus/AWS).



 

Assuming monthly salary of $4,500, total contribution is approximately $1,500 (35% of $4,500) of which around 60%, or around S$950, flows into the Ordinary Account.  For private property investment, monthly usage of monies in the OA account is not regulated, I think.  But you will need to set aside some monies to ensure you meet the minimum sum required and have some sparse cash to withdraw from CPF upon turning 55,  I doubt there will be much left in the OA for most employees considering the high property prices these days.  But then, better to keep cash and manage it yourself then to park it in CPF where the rules are ever changing.
 

Considering the lock-up period, equivalent to 10-20 years bond, 2.5% p.a. return is not exactly fantastic.  4% would be about right but with inflation running at 4-5%, few things make sense these days.

yes better hold cash and manage oneself than to leave in CPF.
 

Real inflation is twice of reported.  

Since property is contained by regulations.

Stocks is the way to go for now.
 

STI 3600 by mid year is my personal target.
 

ps. truth is if only $4,500 pm, better stay in HDB and stop thinking of second property.  think how to make at least $4,500 X 4 before the next step.

I agree with you.  Equity should offer better returns than property in the next few years.
 

I am relatively conservative but a 80:20 debt/equity ratio is too risky for someone earning $4,500 a month, if not much reserve, it is treading on thin ice.  Considering the stamp duty of 16%, negative equity is very real.  A drop of 4% and if you need to sell in year 1, you are in deep sxxt.

yap, agree.... with only $4500, hdb is the better options. with spare cash, go n make some study in share markets, most property shares (reits) is giving out quite attractive dividents... but of cos, there r still risk factor investing money in shares market..
 

to own a condo even at places like Yishun, Sembawang, jurong west, woodlands, min income shld not be lesser than 8K/mth (unit price ard 600K to 800k). 
 

another impt note, the distribution of cpf going into OA, SA & MS will be different. If i remember correctly, the percentage gg into OA will reduce after 35 yrs old n further reduce when u gets older...

agree that external factors do affect property prices.

however, i felt that singapore property market is very UNIQUE due to various reasons lilke government policies, sporean cpf rich, controlled supply, concerted effort/timing/pricing by developers, etc. unlike malaysia, a growth story of a plot of land with highway connection, shopping centre, recreation, etc can fail totally and the house prices can drop 50% or total loss due developer fail or project drop. last but not least, spore is a red dot which means every inch of the land is expensive.
 

1997 financial crisis, 2000 internet bubble, 2003 sars, 2007 lehman collapse, etc did not create situation like usa property foreclosure, etc

nonetheless, i'm not going to buy a 2nd property anytime soon as the price is high at least to me

Private property is kelong in singapore, fully mastermind by govt policies to give the illusion that it is a must-buy, never drop, dream of every sucessful sinkies. Be very careful when even the least capable wants to buy into the story.
 


 
 
 




Since redeeming the existing loan will cost you lesser,  I will redeem the existing HDB loan 1st, and pay lesser downpayment for the new property.... with the extra $$$ on hand, that will give you additional room for error if something wents wrong. 
 

Property investment is one of the good long investment in SG as our land is very limited and the price will only go north in long term, even if there is any major econimy crisis, you can expect the property price to be stable compare to any other form of investment. look at the statistics, i dont think there is anyone who suffer losses by selling his/her HDB flat if the unit if hold for more than 20 yrs (even when u factor in the interest, stamp duty & etc).
 

to play safe, which ever way you intend to do it, make sure that u have buffer for 1 yr for your monthly installment (either 1 or both property).

that not how a bank assesses.

for monthly instalment, the bank expects you to use cash to cover what is over and above your CPF contribution.

the assessment is base on your networth and current/future income as well as stability of cashflow
 

Like for me, I cant borrow, becos wipe table is equivalent to unemployed for most banks...   boo hoo hoo
 

From your question, you seem like you have never bot a property?




I have use CPF for loan la  but I never bother to monitor every $ and cent in my OA account. As long as it stay positive amount in my OA, I am fine with it... haha

just go to hdb office, get a q number, talk to the customer service, fill up a few forms 

hdb will process your application and seek approval from cpf. once cpf board approve, it's done

make sure your OA + SA > $61.5K after deducting the lump sum amount that you wish to settle hdb loan

you can also do it on line via the hsb web page with singpass log in.
 

if want to use cpf to pay for the admin/legal etc as well, just pay lump sum minus 1 or 2 month and hdb will send you a letter to ask if you want to use cpf or cash for this admin/legal fee.  Else got to use cash for the legal fee.

Not correct. Bank will do a full assessment on your credit liability as follow;
 

Annual income

Current outstanding loan (car,house, etc)

Non-secure loan creditability (credit cards health, renovation loan, credit line loan)
 

From above, they will do an assessment to see if u can pay e new loan. If exceed 30% of your annual income, u can forget abt it liao cos loan won't be approved.

Hi,
 

I would like to seek advice on HDB, 2nd private property and loan due to the new ruling.
 

a. should i redeem full hdb outstanding loan ($50k) using cpf. then, i can get 80% loan for 2nd property?
 

b. should i not redeem full hdb outstanding loan ($50k), use cpf oa (after mininimum sum) to pay 2nd property + 60% loan?
 

my hdb interest is 3.8% and cpf oa interest is 2.5%. it makes sense to redeem the outstanding loan because cpf oa is compounding interest on principal accumulation and redeem outstanding loan can save the remaining years interest.
 

if i do redeem, this mean i have to fork out more cash for 2nd property downpayment as cpf oa balance is not much after full redemption. the decision to buy 2nd property is not very firm now and it could be another 1-2 years time or never.
 

What do you think ?
 

Thanks !



 
 

Sounds like you can comfortably pay off the $50k loan and still have more than enough to down 20% for a private property. If that's the case, go ahead and do it. 
 

1. Since your loan interest is higher than your what you earn in CPF OA, redeem the loan

2. Since you can afford to down 20%, you have a choice what and when to buy

3. Can I assume that you have fulfilled your MOP, you will thus have a choice of selling of

  (a) selling off your HDB

  (b) staying in your HDB, and buy a private for rental investment

© rent out your HDB, and buy a private for self stay
 

Buying a private for rental and long term capital appreciation is ok, as long as you stick strictly to the numbers. Timing is a relative word; on hindsight we are all geniuses. In addition, if you can get very good rental yield for your HDB, it makes sense to rent it out and use the rental proceed to finance your private.
 

All the best!!!

spot on. the current plan is to rent out hdb (full unit) and stay in private property if manage to find a good deal in the next 9-12 months.

eyeing condo that is ready by late 2012 to 2013 and hopefully there is oversupply due to 09/10 euphoria 

thus, i need to start my planning now

sorry to burst your bubble.
 

but new HDB agenda is that flats are meant for occupation not rental hence they rejecting all rental applications at the moment. even the old "lock on room " trick isn't working.
 

any rental you do with your hdb is going to be illegal.

Dear bro/sis in property line,
 

If my wife and I already own the current resale flat for 10 years, can we buy a private property still? Some friends say as long as got HDB, cannot own property (not even overseas). Yet, my google results (dated Mar-2011) says can if MOP is met. *confused*

if you own a private property ( local or oversea) first, you cannot buy a HDB.
 

if you buy a HDB first hold until MOP, then you are allowed to buy private property later but max 60% loan only. 
 

if you sell the HDB before upgrading you can take 80% loan.

as far as i know, 60% max loan is based on if u still have outstanding loan for the current house. but if u have no current housing loan, u are able to loan up to 80%, dont have to sell the hdb.

You're right on 80% max loan.. But realistically, if a couple pay off HDB loan and eligible for 80% loan.. Assume a condo cost $1M and they take $800K loan over 20 years..
 

I can imagine the kind of interest they have to pay 
 

Any middle income couple with the right mind shouldn't consider 80% loan even if they are eligible

Can i confirm that the MOP for new flat is 5 yrs even if you paid in full from day one.

I was told you can rent out your new flat after 3 yrs if there is no outstanding loan, is it true?

If it is true, rent out means you must still stay there but can rent the remaining rooms legally right?

Policies keep changing very confusing..can anyone help?

Ans: Not true.. U can still buy hdb but must sell yr private property within 6 mths upon completion of hdb purchase
 

if you buy a HDB first hold until MOP, then you are allowed to buy private property later but max 60% loan only. 
 

Ans: not true.. If u have no outstanding loan.. Be it hdb or private, u can take loan up to 80%. This applies even if u have 20 property, inclusive of 19 private & 1 hdb.. N there is no loan, u can still take up to 80% loan on yr 21st property. However, if yr one n only property has even $1000 of outstanding loan, then max loan is 60%
 

if you sell the HDB before upgrading you can take 80% loan.

Like to clarify on the returning of CPF back (with interest) after selling house.. For example,
 

a. House purchase price = $200K

b. Stamp duty etc = $5K

c. Down payment = $50K

d. Loan granted = 150K

e. Loan period = 5 years@ 2.6% interest

f. Monthly payment = $2698.34 (using Excel to calc =PMT(0.026,5,150000,0))

g. Total CPF used to service loan (d) = $161,900.15 (interest paid = $11,900.15)
 

Based on the above, I have used (b) + © + (g) = $211,905.15 CPF money for house.
 

If I sold the house for $300K (not buying new one), I need to return the $211K + interest that I would have earned if it remains in CPF for 10 years right? 
 

Is it (b) + © and (f) with compound interest @2.5% over 10 yrs? Different calc should apply to (b) + © VS (f) since (b) they affect my "would be" CPF savings different.

That's too complicated calculations. I think you're just interested in the sales proceeds (positive or negative sales), right? 
 

The calculation is quite simple. Go to HDB homepage, log in, and find your outstanding loan amt. Then go to CPF homepage, log in, and find out the amt already used for current property + accrued interest.
 

Sales price of current flat - outstanding loan amt - cpf to be returned to acct with accrued interest - option fee collected from buyer = sales proceeds
 

If it is negative sales, then of course cannot sell, as you have to top up in cash.
