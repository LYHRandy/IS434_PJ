I paid 2 percent but was worth it. Sold the house within 3 days. His network in the area was solid. sold with tenancy. buyer never even view.
 

But my lawyer mentioned that i should only be paying 1 percent for properties above a million.

all along, i thought there is a "standard rule" of 2% selling and 1% buying.

but, of course, rule is not legalized.

if the service is good, you can give more. if the service is poor, you can negotiate for less.

agents will tell u min 2% according to "blah-blah-blah" (BS one)
 

mkt norm for pte is 1% (incl any co-broke comm)
 

and there's no such thing as a "standard" commission as that's been outlawed by CCS. if the agent produce any "documents" to show that they are entitled to charge 2%, report it to CEA. 
 

i once paid 0.5% (incl GST).

U are not wrong to say the least, it's a free market to be a pty agent, nothing2 do with Qualification, Now the luxury market is DEAD and BURIED, not everyday is SUNDAY, whereby 10M changed hand like changing underwear, if one think its so easi to sell landed, go try it out yourself.
 

I have to reduce my asking price for my apt last mth, as landlord we have to be realistic too, if my agent dun work, he/she can kenna from me, In addition, I pay their salary on par with market practice, so thy know me better than fly by nite agt.
 

There is nothng wrong to be a salesman, the only wrong is trying to cheat, rob and steal.
 

Thy earn their right to comms, it's negotiable between owner and agent. gone are the days of fly by nite agt, wih CEA coming on board, I'm sure the market will b in order.

American states can varies fm 2-6%, all depends on what real estate agent can offer for you, for instance, serving a foreigner sourcing leasing apts, checking bank loan for PR and immigrant permits, documentation/ logistic etc

In truth there's no 'fixed' commission. Most important is get an agent you can trust and you feel is worth paying for.
 

And don't be a ngeow chee if agent has really done work for you.

Its a result oriented biz. Only give money to the one who gets u the deal. Rship hardly matters, but tats my view. 
 

As for car dealer, ive also come across good ones. The thing is its a big industry, with minimal qualifications n self employed, therefore u will naturally have more bad hats. But the industry itself is not bad.

Then u shd buy if its a lot lower, which i doubt. The lure of overseas property is the price cos if u have to pay nearly as much, might as well buy in sg. Btw, add Monte carlo to the list of ex properties as well.

the worst agents i find that i have never been able to close a deal with, is those who squeeze me for comm upfront, before even starting to work on the deal. i always tell them if they exceed my expectation, i will definitely pay more. but all they are interested in is lining their own pocket first, securing the comm, and then "co-broking". unfortunately, i have to deal with idiots like this on a daily basis. the worst is sunday one of the call me at 10pm without reading my email ... read wrongly and ask stupid question somemore. kns ... sunday also never give me chance to relax ><
 

but not to say there aren't good hard working agents. i know a few. but thats the problem ..

http://www.homecrawler.com.sg/display/type...Buy_N_Sell.html
 

Procedure to Buy N Sell

Who Can Buy Private Property? All Singapore citizens and companies can freely buy any type of private residential property. However, there are HDB and CPF restrictions that may affect you when you buy a private property.
 

For flats bought directly from HDB (including flats bought from the open market with CPF Housing Grant) 

a) The flats lessees must satisfy the required occupation period for the flat before acquiring the private property

b) The flat lessees must continue to stay in the HDB flat after acquiring the private property.
 

For flats bought from the open market without CPF Housing Grant

There is no need to satisfy the required occupation period for the flat before acquiring the private property. However, the flat lessees must continue to stay in the HDB flat after acquiring the private property.
 

Foreigners or foreign companies can buy certain types of residential property.
 

The Buying / Selling Process:
 

1) Select an agent

Optional, but recommended. A professional agent will not only help you to find the right property, but also ensure you get the right price, ensure all small details are covered prior to purchase, guide you through the process and make recommendations on financing and legal representation.
 

2) Find your property and agree a price

When reaching a preliminary agreement to buy, ensure that all important points have been discussed and agreed, including any repairs or changes prior to purchase, what stays and what goes, any special requirements from both side and the anticipated schedule.
 

3) Sign an Option to Purchase

For Private Property - This is obtained from the seller through their lawyer or agent. At this point you are required to pay a non-refundable option fee (normally 1% of purchase price). The option period is usually 14 days.

For HDB Property - Since 15 April 2003, the HDB standard Option to Purchase has replaced the Sale & Purchase Agreement as the form of contract to be used in resale flat transactions. Buyers and sellers should not enter into any other forms of agreement or supplemental agreements.
 

4) Appoint a Lawyer

You now need to appoint a lawyer to make legal enquiries on the status of the seller, the title of the property and the terms of the sale.
 

5) Arranging Financing

Compare interest rates and special terms when choosing your finance scheme. You can apply for withdrawal of CPF savings by completing an application together with a valuation report prepared by a licensed valuer who is on the CPF panel of valuers.
 

6) Exercise the Option / HDB 1st Appointment

For Private Property - If all is well you now sign the sale contract, and pay 5% of the purchase price (less the option fee). You also need to pay stamp duty within 14 days of the contract.

For HDB Property - The buyer and seller must both attend the Sales Declaration & Registration appointment to seal the closing price. After this appointment, HDB will check eligibility of the transaction and arrange for a 1st Appointment � usually about 4 weeks after the Sales Declaration.
 

7) Legal Inspection & Completion

Your lawyer will carry out an investigation of title deeds and send requisitions to various government departments. The seller�s lawyer will also prepare the completion statement and send documents for stamping to effect completion.
 

8) Settle Payment and Handover / HDB 2nd Appointment

For Private Property - You now settle the outstanding balance of the purchase price. This might be 8 to 12 weeks after exercising the option. The seller�s lawyer will then handover the keys and title deed of conveyance, and you become the owner of your new home.

For HDB Property - Completion takes place at the 2nd Appointment, usually about a month after the 1st Appointment. The insurance and mortgage is arranged and stamp duty, legal fees and agent fees are paid. The sale is completed and arrangements are made for moving into your new home.
 

Entire Process Time: Usually between 10 to 14 weeks

hi guys.. from what i know the agent's comms is usually 1-2% of the sales price.
 
if one were to purchase private property through an agent buyer engaged, does buyer have to pay service fee/comms to the agent? cos i hear some say that the practice is seller will pay comms to agent but not the buyer. 
 
i found more info for rental agent comms and not so much of sales agent comms.
 
thanks guys for sharing your knowledge!!

For private property, only seller pays comms to the seller's agent, the buyer's agent will co-broke with the seller's agent comms, buyer do not have to pay any comms to buyer's agent.

mkt rate for agent comm for pte is 1%. maybe even in today's slow mkt, can nego a little less if one tries n agent is starving. but dun fall for the 2% BS that some agents tell u that it's 'gahmen rule' and try to collect 1% from buyer and 1% from seller.

market practice is seller pay agent comms for private property only, HDB will be different.
 
As a buyer, you can go direct to deal with Seller's agent or you can engage an agent to find for you but your agent will not collect comms from you but collect from the Seller's agent (co-broke).
 
Also, if you buy direct from Seller's agent, that agent cannot collect comms from you as it is against the law (no dual representation, applies to all real estate sales, be it private or HDB).

Last time I sold my HDB, I thought I was smart and decide to have a sliding scale for the commission. 
$210k gets 1% comm, $215k gets 1.5% comm and $220k gets 2% comm
 
The market was getting weaker in the late 80s due to the Thai Baht crisis and after several perspective buyers offered below $210k, finally a buyer offered $214k after some persuasion. I told the agent to close the deal but he told me that he was confident of getting higher price and wanted to work towards $220k to get his higher comm and for me, a higher price. I was not convinced as market sentiment was poor and I was ok with the price anyway. He didn't want to budge and came up with all sorts of excuses and persuaded me not to close the deal. I was flabbergasted and only after offering him a separate comm of $700 did he close the deal for me!!
 
Perhaps I was naive then but just wanted to share this with perspective sellers on what could possibly happen for a sliding scale comm which on paper sounds good!

U are not wrong to say, however I beg to differ, as market getting thinner and less transaction, agents like will face a challenging task, my Life insurance agent will go all the way out to provide excellent services for me and family. Buying lunch and CNY hampers. My whole family insurance policies are with 3 different companies.
 
My property agent/s will conduct excellent follow-up report on buyer's profile, tenant feedback and get me the highest price possible, I pay 1.5-2% comms to all deals. On their homework, thy have to report to me the CMA, seller's checklist and tenant 2 years of tenancy or I will claw back on their comms . . . Most of them did an excellent job.
 
With the current market coming to an end of profitable business flow, I do not think we have rogue agent now, most Life and Property agents have to go through hours of CPD class, endless hours of training, seminar and all coy business conference, they do not want to go against the code of ethics for fear of losing customer's faith hence their license as well, so I eld say not all of them are out to cheat customers, unless always customers are difficult one to deal with.
 
There are black sheep in every respective job, career , not necessary in property line, majority of RES ( Real Estate Salesperson ) hold high education background and qualified to be n Blue or white collar corporate executive/s, but thy chose RES simply they believe in contributing by giving back to society & taking care of their young family doing charitable works too.

One agent told me he only sell above market price. Then he advertised below the agreed selling price without my consent. He mentioned he can sue me, when he found out I engaged another to replace him. I agreed he could do so, but I could also counter-sue him for breach of contract. He quickly apologised and left. That property agency closed down soon after the incident.

ST classifieds. Tip: end the ad wif 'call owner on xxxxxxxx'. 99.9% of the callers r agents wif ready buyer on hand. Easy deal for them coz no need to co-broke or risk other agents playing punk by stealing their buyer, etc.

actually doesn't make sense for the property agent to hold and sell for a higher 0.5% comms- that translate to only 1K for a 200K property. They should just move, especially if sales is made and is within the seller's target. Cos to make that 1K more might take more time and effort esp in a down mkt. Prob in the case, the agent is holding on to a cluster of HDBs in the same area and he can slow his client area without making too much extra effort.
 
to be frank, most agent just want to make sales in quantity rather than make more for the seller as long as it is within the typical mkt range. Sell and move on.

It's usually about 2% on seller's side. On buyer's side they can chose not to pay so the seller's agent will chose to co-broke with buyer's agent.

I always find property agent doesn't do much things, and yet still need to pay them 1-2% of commission?! Many of the paper work that they do, actually seller or buyer can also do themselves, not say very difficult. And for buyer, the flats that agent source for them also get from those property portal and newspaper when everyone can access. Unless your agent really help you to fight for the lowest price for buyer, and high price for seller. If not what is the use of having an agent? Lol.

Bro, you are only seeing the surface.  And you are looking at very straight forward deals, where citizen dealing with citizen, no complexities or financial issues behind them.
 
But not every buyer and seller is so straightforward.  Some buyers have few properties already and may not be citizen so has many financial regulations that they have to meet. Sellers on the other hand may have other backgrounds too, and one mis-step between buyer and seller in not meeting either financial or property regulations can cause a lot of delay, issues, headaches or even law suit. Remember that not every buyer or seller are internet or law savvy especially if they are not Singapore citizen.
 
Why 1-2% commission? I have no idea how that came about, but remember that agent like business owners, are only paid on results. They are not paid on effort. Unlike 80% of the majority who are employees, they get monthly salary only on effort; they can go on long lunches, long coffee breaks, long leaves, and still get paid end of the month with CPF.  Agents has nothing of that, they don't get paid if they don't get results. Period. So think about the risk, the downtime they have to face, the liability in law that they could face if a deal turns wrong, etc, etc.....and I think the fee they get is fair.
 
Note I am not an agent, but I know how they work and the issues they face. They are not just advertising here and there, there are many things that they need to do, to check, to do due diligence before they even market a house or qualify a buyer. If their job is so simple, you won't need a CEA to be form and qualify them through a very difficult RES exam.

in the past I paid 0.5% to one who brought me a buyer who dealt.
I paid my relative 1% for sale of another one.
And another one, i sold myself so paid nothing.
 
Its very possible to sell it yourself.
Just dont be emotional and attached to a property.
Different people have different opinions
no need to let ego get in the way.
 
I think a fair comm for sale of property is between 0.5% to 1%
Anything more is plain excessive.

1% or 2% might seem to be a lot of moolah to pay for someone to seemingly do paper work, but like what @Icedbs said, lots of work goes on behind the scenes.
 
 
I feel the % fee is quite reasonable, some other developed nations have a much higher fee structure.
 
It is also very open here in SG. Buyers and sellers are free to conduct their own paperwork. There is no law to protect the agent industry.

To add on, although i think 0.5% to 1% is about the right range of comms, i feel that there should also be a minimum and a maximum regardless of price of property sold.  What the min and max should be is another topic.  But this is to really put the value of the work done into a fair perspective.

If the agent really good one, definitely I don't mind paying them commission la. Esp if the process of sourcing, paper works etc not easy to handle. But if the selling and buying process is easy, just submit some online paper works, go down to hdb during the 1st and 2nd appointment and nothing much effort being seen, don't think i want to pay 1-2% of commission.  
 
Cause have seen one agent which my friend was recently buying a hdb flat. This agent just simply arrange appointment through the ad found on property portal and newspaper, didn't negotiable or give advice on the pricing that seller asked, and this agent job simply just relate message between the other party agent to my friend, and seems like never fight for the buyer's interest. And yet my friend in the end still pay this agent 1% commission. Lol.

A very learned friend once commented to me on the issue of some lawyers' behaviors
'Well, there are lawyers and there are lawyers'
 
Actually i feel just like every other other profession... there are good ones and there are bad ones.
 
I have met with some pretty crappy lawyers that rip you off.
And they rip off the poor people who are not well educated, mind you. And you guys hate agents and car salesmen?
 
I have met with some lousy doctors that capitalize on your grief and anxiety and order a bunch of unrelated useless tests.
Literally "this and this dun want, the rest all do", he told the nurse, 2 pages worth of tests, costing extra several thousand.
 
Weeks of pain and discomfort later, found out was all irrelevant as another top doctor in the industry actually didn't even want to look at it after we went for a 2nd opinion.  Irrelevant he said.
 
How about car workshops? Engine mounting not spoilt say spoilt. Also the same.
 
So it pays to do some homework, get referrals and stick to the ones that are good, be it doctors/lawyers/agents/car sales people. 
Cos they truly deserve the money that they make.
I dont really bother with phone sales people. Not worth effort to cultivate. Just upgrade new one every year, old one just sell. Price no good? Keep lor.

If the agent really good one, definitely I don't mind paying them commission la. Esp if the process of sourcing, paper works etc not easy to handle. But if the selling and buying process is easy, just submit some online paper works, go down to hdb during the 1st and 2nd appointment and nothing much effort being seen, don't think i want to pay 1-2% of commission.  
 
Cause have seen one agent which my friend was recently buying a hdb flat. This agent just simply arrange appointment through the ad found on property portal and newspaper, didn't negotiable or give advice on the pricing that seller asked, and this agent job simply just relate message between the other party agent to my friend, and seems like never fight for the buyer's interest. And yet my friend in the end still pay this agent 1% commission. Lol.

 
HDB can DIY lah. All the steps etc in HDB website. Any question just email HDB to clarify.

From what I heard the 2% came about because developers starting paying agents 2% to clear their overpriced and bloated stock of new properties. This trickled down to the secondary market where agents said they wanted to be matched with this 2% or they would rather take their potential buyers somewhere else. Soon after 2% slowly became the norm, the transition between 1 to 2 % only started mid 2015 I believe.
 
The decision to pay or not is up to the seller I guess, if can sell yourself by all means save the comms. If the agent is super tokong and can match the sellers asking price (especially in this market) then also worth paying ?

Hi,
Hope that someone experienced can help.
If I have a rented flat, and the tenant wants to renew the tenancy.
Do I still have to pay the agent 1month commission for a simply paper work?
TIA

You only need the agent if you foresee issues with the tenant and don't want to get involved (i.e never pay rent, subletting without permission etc)
 
If you are okay to deal with the tenants directly just write-up a TA make sure the main tenant initials every page get someone to witness and then get it e-stamped.

Everything is possible:) just a matter of cost & learning..
But if agt can bring in higher value & get better price , i prefer engage a professional to do leh.. 
:)
If use of agt can mean better resale value or better rental rate, why not ? If they are professional & can take care of all the tenant problems hassles esp during the 2 yr lease.. I prefer to use them..

Here I tried to put some links to DIY property yourself. Agents goes through training and previously, we do have the internet access to the market. Therefore we have to depend mostly on them. The difference is , one just have to do more leg-work. But, there is good news in today's world, whereby more websites, one can access and do your homework first.
The problem is, all those sites are mostly listed by property agents themselves. What I say is majority is still using agents an easy way out. Eventually the internet-of-things(ioT), is pretty disruptive. They have done it Taxi's and insurance market. I have seen some sites similar DIY property (diypropertyhelper.com.sg) , whereby buyer and seller communicate. I believe more could be on the way.
 
There are many more sites alike. But is still in an infant stage. Once people are well informed, we will be seeing this happening soon.
 
Years back , we used to buy all stuffs from brick-and-mortar. Today, we see something we like, next we access websites to check the compare price and eventually buy from there. I am a Lego fan, used to visit local Lego shops. But now I ended up buying from ebay instead.

While I am not against people who DIY a property transaction themselves, I always could not really rationalise why they would not want to use an agent.
 
The commission that is paid is always included in the selling price. If a seller wants to sell a house for say $1m, the agent would always try to sell it above $1m so that his commission is already part of that price. And if the agent could not sell it above $1m, the seller can always reject that agent.
 
Also, if the agency agreement is not exclusive, there is no stopping the seller from trying to sell it himself and using the agent at the same time! Agents may hate me for suggesting this, but through this way, an inexperience seller can tap on an agent expertise (and advice) but at the same time, trying to look for buyer himself as well.
 
So I am not sure about this not using agent mentality. Is it because one does not like another fellow earning a commission out of him? Or is it an ego issue? If the agent is able to sell the house  above seller asking price, then what is the issue of using an agent? I feel that the biggest value an agent provides is to help to filter out all the "not qualified" buyers/sellers in order to avoid a transaction that may turn sour or could not go through at the end. All the DIY guidelines given in property blogs/property websites are like a recipe book; it tells you all the ingredient and steps to cook a decent dish, but it doesn't show you all the necessary technique, experience and considerations in tacking all the "what ifs" if a step doesn't turn out to be right during the cooking process itself.. That you will need an experience chef to tell you how.

It is possible but are you sure that you can handle all risks? Stakes are high. Check this article https://tranio.com/traniopedia/tips/real_estate_agents_commissions_in_various_countries/ it highlights real estate agency commission rates in different countries. They are not that big, but an agency is able to guarantee that your savings will work

That's true, especially during tough market like now since the agent has to put in more effort to find a buyer.
 
To tackle this, I have thought of a suggestion which I did share with some of the agents. It works quite well with some of them who is flexible with non-exclusive as long there is some win-win.
 
I told them why not set a timeline with the owner who didn't want to give exclusive. .Say a timeline of a month.  Agent take the deal on a non-exclusive basis for a month. If the owner can sell the house himself within that month, then kudos to him and the agent can save some effort and move on. If the agent can sell it within that month, then no issue to take lesser commission since not much effort in closing the deal anyway (in current tough conditions, getting some $$ quickly is better then waiting for a big $$$ for months!) .
 
But once it crosses one month, owner should give exclusive to the agent since owner is aware that it is difficult to sell himself and same goes to the agent who certainly need to put in more effort to sell it too. This is a fair proposition to the owner  (or to DIYers) who didn't want to give exclusive at the start but still want to tap into an agent expertise for advice

Alternatively give a 3% commission but no exclusive

Just saw an agent trying to sell a condo near Chinese garden. 
 
Claimed that the market crash already over and this is as bad as it will get. I had better buy quick before the other people realise this and the price shoot up to $1600-1800psf by next yr and $2000 psf in the near future.

I think that the fundamental flaw is that agents are more incentivized in CLOSING, than really selling at the best price. Because at the end of the day, they are paid on commission, no deal=no commission. The only person who WANT to sell at the highest price is yourself. If really want to use agent, no exclusivity, so all the agents will cheong for you.

There is more on the way. Once there is a good site equal to ebay sort, we can do it ourselves. That you will save quite a sum for a big ticket item like this. Agents target to close deals in the shortest period. They will hardly bolder to get you a good deal. That is why, many prefer to sell projects.

Lawyers shld be the one complaining about lowball fees. 
 
Study like sh*t to get good PSLE grades to get into a good Sec school. Then study again like sh*t to do well in O-Levels to get into a good JC. Then study like sh*t again to do well in A-Levels to get into Law school. The study again like sh*t to graduate. Then work and study like sh*t to pass the Bar. Then invest heaps of $$ to open a legal practice & run it. This whole long road and they charge $2.5k in conveyancing fees and have to keep the case on file for a few years. For a $1M property, that's only 0.25% in fees.
 
Powderful negotiator (or whatever fancy names they give themselves) onli has to pass O-level, sit for the salesperson exam and expects to collect 2% comm......? http://www.mycarforum.com/public/style_emoticons/#EMO_DIR#/laugh.gif http://www.mycarforum.com/public/style_emoticons/#EMO_DIR#/laugh.gif No wonder our tiny island has over 30,000 agents!
But law firms can handle 100 conveyancing cases in a month but agents can't close 100 deals in a month

You can ask him Chinese garden 2kpsf how much will Orchard cost? 
 
Somebody mentioned at max 2% gain a year. That is about 20 to 30 psf gain annually. Unlikely to be much higher and may even be flat or marginally negative if economy tanks.

To me is simple. If someone offer a service that make my life easier, get me a better deal and give me a channel to go to for after sales service What is the big deal to pay that little commission?  For property agents, if they put in an ad to sell my property, filter the low ballers, get me my targeted selling price and handle all the paper work for me.  I see no problem to pay them a commission.  Again, everything can be done without an agent.  Buy/sell your property or even import your own car but do one person want to go through the whole process?   Let people make a living lah.

Strongly agree.
 
I feel my time is too precious and the risk to missing any step in the purchase is too risky to do all by myself.
 
Anything goes wrong, I can sue agent and agency. But I cannot sue myself.

Agents don't handle all the paperwork, they only handle the sales and purchase agreement, after that, they throw it to the lawyers and they don't need to see you again except to collect their commission. In fact I feel it is high time someone came up with a website to match buyer and seller together without the need for agents.

diffulty is agent wont wanna do work unless exclusive is givenNot really; they are all itching to sell  or Rent out and increase their selling  power be it selling or leasing or looking for buyers behalf; Some even resort to "tagging" to get a blast of your unit in the market; Market is real bad; They are also now down to earth.   
In my case of rental unit; the Agent just to close  the deal   ; threw in a washing machine and dryer for the tenant because the Tenant really squeeze my bxxxs until like dunno what  and with a move in condition like 2 months away some more
 
I always give sort of exclusivity (for only 1 month period) for the Agent that brought in a previous Tenant; I tell him that in very clear Terms; after that its open market if he/she cannot get anything done; Anyway even after 6 months the Unit was still vacant until last month finally got one Tenant and I also like on verge of giving up and just accept his lowball rent as per the Tenant request. BTW i had like 6 Agents in my hand and non will say No.
 
I guess its the same as selling too as I have done the same similarly. Friend friend one I give chance first after that .... its open market
 
Actually most property agents use Property Guru for both selling and rentals

It's not market very bad. 
It's a combination of too many agents to begin with and competition.
 
Long ago when market was heating up, I took 2-3 months to choose tenant. And also need to wait a couple of months then they come in. But prices were more favorable.

For local tenant,  I handle myself coz no need to talk through agent.  If there are difficult tenants that landlords can't handle,  agents will not be able to handle as well. The only time i really need an agent is for my overseas property, coz i really need someone to manage it in my absence.

Some tenants need more coordination and monitoring.

It depends on whether one has time for it and the quality of tenant. Some tenants need more coordination and monitoring.It depends how busy you are to manage the tenant,  but seriously,  there isn't much to manage for local tenants unless landlords have a problem unit that need maintenance all the time.

Some people travel a lot for their work. I got a friend half the time not in SG. He has got units in China as well as locally. 
 
Some tenants may delay payment as well. If quality tenant with time to follow then no need agent.
 
But their net is larger so first time usually get them.

That is why finding the right tenant is important.  I always tell people that it is better to forego that extra $100-200 a month to get a better tenant. I have agents telling me I can get $2800 but must accept 4 to 6 people on WP in my unit,  another professional couple comes along and offers me $2500-2600 I will go with the couple.  Some landlords are simply greedy so they get what they deserve sometimes. I have never had issues with collecting rent coz I always screen my tenants. I am always fortunate to be able to find tenants that travel all the time but still pay rent on the first day of every month.

Likewise. 
 
Only tenants that have proven their mettle get to transact direct. So far those have been steady, collect less is fine.
 
But managing multiple units plus full time job requiring travel might be quite a handful for most.
 
No right or wrong.

In this article, I came across this:
 
Wheelock Properties rolled out the “ABSD assistance package” at Ardmore Three on April 13 comprising a 15% discount and a 15% ABSD rebate. It has since moved at least 32 units at the project. Separately, Wing Tai Holdings is understood to have offered a 6% commission to agents for The Crest in April and May.
 
The small-size (and hence cheaper) unit in The Crest is priced at $1M and upwards.  Hence, the commission for selling an unit is already guaranteed to be $60K and upwards.
 
But it is hard to sell any units in significant numbers for this condo development.  Just last month, only 7 units were sold.

Agents don't handle all the paperwork, they only handle the sales and purchase agreement, after that, they throw it to the lawyers and they don't need to see you again except to collect their commission. In fact I feel it is high time someone came up with a website to match buyer and seller together without the need for agents.
 
The paperwork part is more than just S&P thesedays.
 
Reason is because CEA wants transparency in every step between agent and seller/buyer.
 
So for e.g, even to advertise a property for the seller, the agent need the seller to consent on a form for approval. The letter of consent has to even specify if the agent can only do an exclusive advertisement or he can rope in other agents to market for him. In the old days,  any marketing goes as long the agent can sell the property. Then there is also recent PDPA to complicate the process.
 
This is just one simple example where paperwork has to be involved. There are many others.
 
Not so easy thesedays. As I said before, if things are simple, then why CEA need agents to pass the RES exam before they can become agent? Some people I know fail multiple times in that exam before they pass. And these people includes degree holders/Masters.  Ask around and most will tell you how difficult this paper is.

Really?
 
I always thought those that fail were those old timer agents who didn't have much education in the past but are very good at sales.

Bro, if I am not wrong, those old time existing agents didn't need to take RES because they took another paper in the very old days. Maybe some older agents can comment.
 
But the purpose of RES is to really filter out the new agents, those who are serious and committed and not any ah beng, ah seng. A majority of RES paper 1 is on professional ethics and code of conduct, and it is not a simple Yes/No/True/False kind of question.  Paper 2 is mostly on HDB and it is a killer.

U took the exams? Yes it is very tough now  
Word on the street is passing rate is about 30%. Many of the failures could be double degree, masters etc lol

Ya know, similar mentality is also found in some of the older pioneer generations?
 
Its the "I have paid for it, hence I can the take everything from the property", aka "Airline Cutlery is Mine" syndrome
 
Many came from poorer backgrounds, and its a dog eat dog society where they are from, hence such a mindset.
 
Unfortunately, it is also manifested in many educated migrants, and we are bringing in proportionally large quantities, causing a destabilization of the society.

what is the objective of this thread, being a property or life insurance agents or even car salesman ?, thy are commission basis, and I'm pretty sure at least 1-2 of them are our relatives, ex-colleagues or friends are in the same trade or industry, not being stereotyping them, at least thy don't go out to rob, steal and cheat people.
 
This are decent sale orientated people who earned a decent living, if thy ahem done well, it is their forte of selling/ a special breed group of people, Someone just mentioned Real Estate personnel are never obsolete, true or false, we can't actually fathom the notion, coz I do believe few of my friends are in these lines ( Car sales- relatives, Life insurance ( ex-school teacher and RES ( biz owners ). Thy prefer the easy hours of working and earning their keep.

Definitely true.
 
The authorities also cannot state that landlords cannot prefer certain profiles of tenants or tenants cannot prefer a certain landlord profile.
 
Can also choose whether want singles or families and what types of families. With more deferring their purchase (pent up demand), rental transactions have grown much more than sales. At least that is my experience, independent of what news seem to say.

Trying to put a balance perspective to this so I'm just quoting what one agent told me on why his client doesn't want to rent out to Indians.
 
An Indian's diet includes curry and turmeric amongst other spices. Turmeric leaves a yellowish stain on fingers and the switches in the house are all stained yellow and it's hard to get rid of. Leftover curry is poured into the sink which sometimes finds it's way to the bedroom toilet pipes and gives out a smell which lingers and not to mention sometimes chokes the pipes.
 
Due to this, the owner doesn't want to rent his house to Indians as he feels it's not right to stop them from eating curry which is their staple food but neither does he want to spend money to clean up after them and it may not even be possible to clean up even if he pays for it.
 
The explanation doesn't sound racist nor discriminatory to me and in fact sound perfectly logical.
What do you guys think??

phrase it this way... i have never walked into an empty house..  and can tell the owner/tenant is which race...  that indication comes from decor... but then again. i have never rented out to indians... so maybe im wrong... 
 
but i truely dont set such rules/regulations when ever i have to rent out... 
 
the explanation you heard.. feels logical tho.... juz maybe i never experienced it..

actually I can see the point.  even as neighbours, I have to smell their curry everyday.  it is an overdose to most people.  but even though so, it has not stopped me from renting out to Indians for my tenanted unit. 
 
I find there is nothing wrong for landlords to specify they don't want tenant of particular race or nationality.  it is his house and if he chooses to forsake rental for the preferences of his upkeep of his house, why not?

That is why finding the right tenant is important. I always tell people that it is better to forego that extra $100-200 a month to get a better tenant. I have agents telling me I can get $2800 but must accept 4 to 6 people on WP in my unit, another professional couple comes along and offers me $2500-2600 I will go with the couple. Some landlords are simply greedy so they get what they deserve sometimes. I have never had issues with collecting rent coz I always screen my tenants. I am always fortunate to be able to find tenants that travel all the time but still pay rent on the first day of every month.
Well said, I have previously waited up to 6 months to tenant out a room.
 
That said, if its the entire home unit, if I already know that I intend to do a full scale renovation after this round, then it doesnt matter.
 
Especially so when the newer furnishing can get more rental &......at the same time its so sayang to smash it during the following reno in 2-3 years time....so might as well.....

Room tenancy is more tricky to rent out cos most of the tenants (even the single ones) I am aware of do not like to live with the landlord.
 
For the privacy, they may prefer to pay more for a one bedroom unit. Pricing wise, two bedroom offers the best flexibility though as sharing between people they are familiar with helps to lower rent paid per person.

as always, a one-sided story. 
 
Such dispute between landlord and tenant is common. The only surprise I had is why didn't the landlord contact the tenant directly? Wouldn't that make communication much more direct and clear?
 
25 years ago, I was renting rooms and apartments. As a tenant, I had problems such as my letters being opened up by the landlord kids, my shoes got chewed by my landlord dog, and the house was accessed without me knowing (i thought got thief). Never once I contacted the landlord agent. I just contact the landlord directly and resolved the issue with him.  No emails and no watsapp back then, so, just a simple phone call and it is done.
 
Therefore when I read the case in the link above, I cringe.  Why must people make it so complicated? Landlord and tenants dispute are common and has been around for centuries, so communication and tolerance is key.

Something is very wrong here  

 
It is not a matter of can't pay the agent commission, it is a matter of why pay? Lawyers are trained conveyancing professionals to handle all due diligence work pertaining to property transactions so why doubt the lawyer?
 
In fact, the lawyers will extend their service to preparing the option to purchase for you if you don't know how to do it yourself. Very simple for the private property seller, just spend some money on newspaper advertising for the unit until a buyer comes along. If the buyer is keen, just go down to the lawyer's office to get everything done. For hdb, it is even lagi simple. Go online to do the seller's checklist and after you find a buyer through advertising, just go down to the HDB branch office together and the HDB officer will guide you through the steps accordingly (they are paid to do that!)

If you feel so injustice to pay a service provider. Just do everything yourself. Don't have to use any reason to make you feel better. Just like buying a car through agent. Go import your car and you dont have to let the agent earn a single cent. I always believe we need to let some trade earn the money if it give me convenience and peace of mind.

Go online to do the seller's checklist and after you find a buyer through advertising, just go down to the HDB branch office together and the HDB officer will guide you through the steps accordingly (they are paid to do that!)

 
 Let's put it this way. One can do anything yourself. You can even self medicate,  pull your own tooth, repair your own car and renovate your own house.. Question is do you have the time, the knowledge similar to a professional,  and the mental fortitude to do all this work knowing that you are doing the right thing and it is all good?
 
I don't know about you, but I will pay the doctor, the dentist, the mechanic and the contractor to do the above jobs for me.
 
However when comes to property agents, I realise there are two problems:
 
1) Many pple think that the agent job is just to find buyer and seller.  I wish it was this simple. And if it was indeed this simple, then I wonder why CEA make all new agents go through that RES exam . Even more puzzling would be if it was that simple, why some people took 1-2 years just to clear that exam!
 
2) Some agents are not helping in projecting the right professionalism to this industry.  They make it look like, well, just finding buyer and seller. They make it look like anyone on the street could do it better than them.  And this has been going on for years and years, which fortunately the authorities were set up in 2010  to oversee  their conduct and ethics.
 
The property agent job, among all the marketing duties that they are known  to do, is first and foremost have the right knowledge to ensure that the legality of a property transaction remains intact and complied with the myriad of property policies that are ever-changing in this country. Legality here, besides checking eligibility of buyer/seller,  also means the need to do due diligence in ensuring that the transaction does not consist of any money laundering,  terrorist financing activities. or harboring illegal immigrants for tenancy cases.  An agent has a legal liability to  all these criminal activities.
 
Then the next one is really on financial calculations. Calculating sales proceeds, taxes, CPF grants, estimated monthly mortgage, TDSR, LTV, etc, may look simple, but not when you have different calculations for Sporeans, PR and foreigners.  A financial tool can do this, but I have yet to see one wonder tool that can do every property financial  calculation out there.  And what happens when policy change, can that tool still keep up?

 Let's put it this way. One can do anything yourself. You can even self medicate,  pull your own tooth, repair your own car and renovate your own house.. Question is do you have the time, the knowledge similar to a professional,  and the mental fortitude to do all this work knowing that you are doing the right thing and it is all good?
 
I don't know about you, but I will pay the doctor, the dentist, the mechanic and the contractor to do the above jobs for me.
 
However when comes to property agents, I realise there are two problems:
 
1) Many pple think that the agent job is just to find buyer and seller.  I wish it was this simple. And if it was indeed this simple, then I wonder why CEA make all new agents go through that RES exam . Even more puzzling would be if it was that simple, why some people took 1-2 years just to clear that exam!
 
2) Some agents are not helping in projecting the right professionalism to this industry.  They make it look like, well, just finding buyer and seller. They make it look like anyone on the street could do it better than them.  And this has been going on for years and years, which fortunately the authorities were set up in 2010  to oversee  their conduct and ethics.
 
The property agent job, among all the marketing duties that they are known  to do, is first and foremost have the right knowledge to ensure that the legality of a property transaction remains intact and complied with the myriad of property policies that are ever-changing in this country. Legality here, besides checking eligibility of buyer/seller,  also means the need to do due diligence in ensuring that the transaction does not consist of any money laundering,  terrorist financing activities. or harboring illegal immigrants for tenancy cases.  An agent has a legal liability to  all these criminal activities.
 
Then the next one is really on financial calculations. Calculating sales proceeds, taxes, CPF grants, estimated monthly mortgage, TDSR, LTV, etc, may look simple, but not when you have different calculations for Sporeans, PR and foreigners.  A financial tool can do this, but I have yet to see one wonder tool that can do every property financial  calculation out there.  And what happens when policy change, can that tool still keep up?
 
Then comes the marketing. This is the part where agents have to comply with ethical marketing.  What is ethical marketing? Explaining this is one module by itself in the RES syllabus, and unfortunately this is also the part that some agents did not do well leading to most people thinking that they could better market themselves.

That would  be the day where the value of an agent work will be truly seen, and I won't be surprise if the authorities are already making plans to go there.
I am not saying that agents can't add value,  I am saying that people who wish to buy and sell a property can do it on their own and save on tens of thousands in commission. It is just a matter of whether the seller wants to be lazy or hardworking.  Face it, those financial calculations that agents do is really no rocket science. Any ignorant person that doesn't know anything just needs to ask the staff of hdb, cpf and housing mortgage dept in any bank etc.  
Agent services tend to be utilised by sellers who want to find a buyer faster, tapping on the network of the clients. This does not apply to all agents coz only agents that have been in the market long enough tend to have that kind of network.

I have a bone to pick with marketing by some property agents.
 
It is common practice for all of them to list down the recent transacted prices for equivalent properties in the neighbourhood. There is no representation that the agent is the one who did the transaction, but I don't put it beyond contemplation that the idea here, apart from giving information about recent prices, is to create the impression for the unsuspecting to think that the agent is the one who sold all those properties.
 
Then there are some, thankfully not so many (yet), who stick their own ads all over the neighbourhood, such that they are impossible to peel away cleaning. These agents don't give a rat's @rse about the cleanliness of the place. They should be made to do CWO to clean up their own ads, and then some.

If you feel so injustice to pay a service provider. Just do everything yourself. Don't have to use any reason to make you feel better. Just like buying a car through agent. Go import your car and you dont have to let the agent earn a single cent. I always believe we need to let some trade earn the money if it give me convenience and peace of mind.2% of the selling price must be a cheap price to you for convenience. Fortunately,  not everyone thinks that way.

It is not a matter of can't pay the agent commission, it is a matter of why pay? Lawyers are trained conveyancing professionals to handle all due diligence work pertaining to property transactions so why doubt the lawyer?
 
In fact, the lawyers will extend their service to preparing the option to purchase for you if you don't know how to do it yourself. Very simple for the private property seller, just spend some money on newspaper advertising for the unit until a buyer comes along. If the buyer is keen, just go down to the lawyer's office to get everything done. For hdb, it is even lagi simple. Go online to do the seller's checklist and after you find a buyer through advertising, just go down to the HDB branch office together and the HDB officer will guide you through the steps accordingly (they are paid to do that!)

 Of course, one can DIY everything thus saving on comms, Sp vendors are not so smart or savvy, If everything can DIY, all those high end Rest, Pub, KAroake joint, Country clubs, Retailer close shops.
 
 All of us can P.I. cars, aeroplane, boat etc liao, still has to pay import tax, insurance, this is very bad, only making money yet can't afford to pay comms for services rendered.
 
 If one think selling properties is easy as ABC, try it out yourself, till something goes wrong. Muahahaha !
  
Buying landed pty don't need lawyer liao ! back to stone age.  

Some people don't even uses their brain before they start yalking away . . .

DIY to import n buy a car is different from diy to sell a property, you are taking things out of context.   
I have sold my own condo before and I can say it is really a piece of cake. After getting the buyer to sign the otp and collecting the 1%, all I did was hand the otp to my lawyers to deal with the buyer's lawyers.  I only saw the buyer once and that was it. For hdb, what are the staff sitting in the branch offices for? Buyers and sellers just need to get a Q number and the officer will run through the process in detail.

Those things you mentioned are just procedures. What makes you think that if you would have engaged an agent he can't get a higher price for you? Need to see the big picture, not just simplicity.

I have spoken to countless agents who are only keen to educate buyers on selling at X-value which is the average market rate or slightly higher. Do remember that buyers are not stupid today,  they look at past transaction prices as well. You think that just because agents coat their words with honey the buyers would pay 100k above X-value in today's market?  I don't think you are as naive as that right?

Get back at them.
 
Write their name and phone no at every show flat guest book.
 
Type in their email address on the spam I want a bigger penis ads.
 
Type their phone nos in fax machines with auto redial.
 
Drop their ads and name cards in known toilets for gays to make friends.
 
Send their name, phone no and email to nice men in Nigeria who's uncle
 
just died and wants to share a billion dollars with you.

If the agent is simply using x-value to manage your expectations, then I think he could actually do more.  Even SRX (who came out with X-value) recognizes that X-value is just a very basic benchmark and this is why they have a premium service called X-listing price.
 
For myself, this is normally how I would expect an agent suggest a selling price:  Need to look at
 
1) Agency in-house preliminary valuation to get a range (for hdb)
2) Recent transacted prices for similar units to get where the current market acceptance is
3) Current competitive listing within your project or near your block  and their prices. These units will compete with you for the same group of buyers.
4) X-value
5) Bank valuation
 
He should use some or all of the data above and then see what is the renovation level of the current house. Then go through the items above with the owner, use data to drive towards a logical price and let him decide what price he wants. If he truly wants to sell, he will be convince that the suggested price is based on a set of data analysis which consist of his house condition, current market prices, and current competitive  factors. End o f the day, the seller must be comfortable of his asking price and not a price that was force down to him simply because it is based on "gut feel" or x-value from the agent.

In the current market, I think most buyers would be hesitant to buy above valuation so in a sense, agents can't really do sh*t to fetch higher prices for owners no matter how good a a talker they are, hence paying agents com so they can "get higher prices" for owners just won't make much sense in this property market. Actually for almost all the points you mentioned, the seller can easily find that out himself without the agent.

Property Agent's Commission
 
There are few inequalities in the way the property agent's commission is being paid.
 
Firstly, in rentals,
why only landlord have to pay commission?,
because the rules are such that no agent can represent both parties, hence, the landlord have to pay the share (co-broke) of agent's commission of the tenant? But the unusual logic here is landlord pay tenant's agent commission to safe guard tenant's interest?
 
I believe both tenant and landlord should pay their share of property's agent commission. Otherwise, tenant can abuse the system.
 
Likewise, in a property sale.
 
CEA doesn't seem to think anything wrong with the current arrangement.

Think still depends where the location is and also the condition of the house. There are still buyers who buy above valuation. Ultimately still willing seller willing buyer. Like those hdb flats sell at near 1 mill, i believe the flat should sell above valuation quite a lot.

i think it is a sticky point especially on how to convince tenant/buyer that when they are payer and yet have to also pay commission whereas for the landlord/seller it is accepted because they are the payee.
 
most times tenant/buyer will choose not to be represented by agent so as to save on the commission.  the only exception so far is when the tenant is a corporate client or newly settled into singapore that they accept they have to pay agents a commission to do the search and bargaining.
 
i also don't like to pay high commission as seller/landlord for my agent to share with the agent representing buyer/tenant but if indeed the price is much higher than market transacted prices, then why not?

These days information is easily available for both the buyers and sellers unlike 20-30 years ago.

If the buyer willing to pay and like the location and the house, whether agent marketing skills good or not, buyer still would buy. Lol.

i see quite a few advocates of DIY house selling.  i would very much want to do the same but i would like to point to the fact that the playing field has changed quite a bit.  Last time newspapers was the main source of leads for property on sale but i think now people turn to propertyguru portal as main source of leads instead?  if you realise also, propertyguru doesn't allow non-agents to advertise.  if we go back to selling our own via ST classifieds, i think the number of prospective buyers will be greatly reduced.  It may take a much longer time before you get a good price for it selling it on your own.

Ptyguru is anti-competitive and acting against the interest of people wanting to sell their properties themselves.

haha i am neutral on the anti-competitive argument but i like to add that gumtree and carousell are probably not very appropriate platforms to advertise a property for sale.  nevertheless, there is still SPH classifieds to turn to.

PG has forgotten one very important thing, without owners selling or renting in the first place, they have no business. I think this is not the way for PG to repay their kindness to property owners out there. If they want to earn money,  very simple,  just charge the same kind of subscription they charge to agents for owners to advertise and I am sure their business will double.

The main gripe i hear from my friends is that they felt that the agent comms is unjustified and disproportionate to the actual work that they do. 
 
this is even more so ever since property prices skyrocketed with all the foreign money inflow into sg.
 
Did property agents do more work as compared to previously? 
 
For a service of convenience, there is rightly a fee to be paid. It is the quantum that most people are not happy with.

$10000 (excluding gst) or 2% com is way too high for selling a $500k hdb flat. For condos $1mil and above the comms are even more ridiculous. Sellers are capable of selling their own houses but there must be fair competition and no anti-competitive practices out there.

agree with you.  most things with properties, cars and house maintenance i don't DIY bcos of lack of time, need for a lot of effort or need to suffer the unpleasant aspects of it.
 
but of course, there are the odd few times i did the sale, rental or maintenance of house and car on my own.  most of the times when i did so is because i am quite free, i have the expertise and i dont have to suffer much unpleasantry when i did them and the savings justify it.  then there are also the cases of some types of agent see some types of properties, always take the easy way out by offering a low asking price/rent.  by selling/renting on our own, besides saving the commission, we also gain with a higher price/rent.

I'm not from PG but I believe their business is to provide a system for agents to advertise their products and help secure businesses for the agents.  So this is their value add to the agents and so agents are willing to pay them to advertise in their website.   Every business have their intended model of operation.  If they open up to everyone......they are no different from gumtree or carousell.   Again as I said. There are always other channel for owners and buyers to go to but most feel that PG have the most updated and perhaps the widest data they can depend on.  May be buyers can also go knock doors on potential sellers so that they can buy the property from them directly and is free......

there of course has to be a fee for a service and for a reasonable amount.
 
i feel that such services should have a fixed range rather than a percentage of the total transaction amount. 
 
those services that require specialised tools or training no choice.

there of course has to be a fee for a service and the amount is reasonable. 
 
those services that require specialised tools or training no choice.

Is definitely possible to DIY.  But some lazy people like me will want the agents to advertise for me...to talk to the potential buyers....to run my paperwork....to even filter low ballers.  The selling price is for me to set so I will factor in the agents commission in my selling price.......So if he know my minimum selling price, he won't bring any low ballers to me....if he still do so...he can F**k off and I won't engage him......remember, until all my needs are fulfilled, he don't earn my commission....and if he did what I want.....I'm willing to pay him...

For certain things like car repair or installation of aircon,  DIY is too daunting a task for most people,  but pty selling is self-teachable. Another really good point for the govt to encourage DIY property selling is to reduce transaction prices. Very often sellers will be factoring in agent fees into the selling price,  creating an artificial layer on top of the actual price.

Don't forget that your time is precious as well. If you get agents that have so many listings to prioritise, chances of him putting your unit on a back burner is very high. Yes, you have the right to sack an ineffective agent,  but remember that it could be months later. You market yourself,  whether you receive calls from low ballers or not,  you are in absolute control.

be aware that many agents even try to sell below the minimum selling price of the seller and not have the interest of their seller client in mind because :
 
1) they are taught by their agencies the trick of emotional entrapment by dangling the option cheque to persuade the seller to accept a lower asking price
2) the way they are remunerated, it makes every sense for them to sell quickly rather than be drawn into a protracted sale holding out for higher prices.
3) it is probably easier to persuade people to accept less rather than to pay more

The debate will never end. While it is good to get if off one's chest. It does nothing moving forward. 
 
Those who believes and sympathized with property agents or even insurance agents, perhaps can go one step further by naming the exemplary agents they encountered. In so doing, members can use them. This will encourage them to do better.
 
What you guys think?
 
 
PS: Personally I had never come across an honest agent yet. I don't want to explain myself but I am sure all of us are looking for that one agent that we can deal with for a long time.

These days the only commitment agents have is to their pockets. If they find a buyer,  they will show the buyer a list of units and yours is just one of the units. The moment the buyer says he is not keen on your unit,  the agent would then divert his attention to swinging the buyer to other units to earn his cobroke commission, casting your unit one side. If the owner signed an exclusive with the agent,  even better for the agent, coz he knows you can't run away n he can take his time.

Every man to work to earn his keep. What the Govt has done signalled the stand quite clearly and 1500+ has quit.
 
If people are still using their service and paying them comms, one can choose to join, to go through them or not to.
 
Its a free market. No point griping about what others apparently has.
 
We see agents have high comms, teachers have long holidays, MPs and ministers have high pay for part-time work, businessmen earnings shiok. Join them and you see if it is justifiable to feel that way.

This thread (not started  by me) is on property agent's  commission so the discussion here is centered on their commission and work. Nobody is griping, we are discussing.

Then I had relatives joining and can never see them for weekends. Got all kinds of duties and false leads or follow up. Sometimes it eats even into lunchtimes.
 
Maybe the only thing good is a tiny bit more flexible and wake a bit later. There will always be those who prefer to use them and those who don't. Life with variable salary not everyone can take it.

I agree with you but that brings me to think of poor taxi drivers. Just how many times do you hear property agents get go straight to hospital card. I am sure in any day, many taxi drivers get cursed by their clients, there are shift work - no work no pay, cannot use mobile to chat while at work, worried about being fine by TP all the time, weekends also burn because can earn more, some clients horrible - call booking but nowhere to be found especially those very early in the morning. Forgot to add, have not heard of taxi drivers earning million dollars from their driving.
 
I believe the problem stems from poor service provided by many with property agents. The commission is huge 1-2% of the gross rental or sale price. Most times, the expectation is not matched by the service provided by property agent. Furthermore, many property agencies always give this "false" impression that they got the "best, ethical and etc" agents from their company in their advertisement. Also there is a legacy problem with this profession.
 
Bro, the point is, the grass is always greener on the other side.

PG is anti competitive not because of the users they target, it is in their exclusion of owners to advertise their own properties, in a sense forcing owners to use their registered agents. PG has forgotten one very important thing, without owners selling or renting in the first place, they have no business. I think this is not the way for PG to repay their kindness to property owners out there. If they want to earn money, very simple, just charge the same kind of subscription they charge to agents for owners to advertise and I am sure their business will double.
 
I don't think PG is so dumb not to realise that there are far more buyers/sellers than agents. Doing direct buyer/seller business would have yield them far more $$$. And as a business,  I do not think they will be sympathetic to agents,  if the direct buyer/seller model would work.
 
The problem is,  for policy heavy (and complicated) country  like Singapore, the direct model will not work very well online.  Just one news online that a PG direct buyer-seller transaction deal falls through because of wrong buyer/seller eligibility will be enough to keep most buyers/sellers wary about using the platform. As an online business, I think what they want is a predictable perpetual revenue stream that is backed by professionals (agents)  rather than a possible windfall revenue that could be uncertain and may be impacted by wrong practices from buyers/sellers.
 
You need to understand that not every buyer/seller is as savvy as you. Similarly, despite all the information in the internet, most people would still prefer to go out to buy a PC than to read and find out how to save $$$ by assembling one themselves  Most people value their time, their job, their family than to go through the hassle of doing property transaction themselves where they have to spend time dealing with viewings, buyers. agents, etc and still need the knowledge to ensure that the transaction is legitimate and criminal free. So I am sure PG has their reason for not opening it up, but if the timing is right and all the buyers/sellers is knowledgeable and mature enough, I think PG will open it up faster than you could blink.

For pte property transactions, OTP can be done directly at the law firm if sellers/buyers are not savvy, hence when a buyer is found, the next stop for buyers and sellers to go is straight to the law firm to sign. This opens up an avenue for PG to gain revenue from law firms advertising on their website, not just developers.  
For hdb transactions,  the first 4 pages of the standard otp from hdb already list out the procedure thoroughly.  All PG needs to do is replicate that information on their website.  With my model of allowing direct advertising from sellers,  the site visits and business of PG will grow phenomenally. 
 
Despite all that is mentioned above,  PG can continue to pull in revenue from agents who would have to up their service standards to compete with the direct sellers. Agents can also contact the seller advertisers to match buyers to them for a com if they are a step faster than the sellers. To me this is healthy competition and should be encouraged. Any agent who is against is definitely not working in the interest of the housing market.

The main gripe i hear from my friends is that they felt that the agent comms is unjustified and disproportionate to the actual work that they do. 
 
this is even more so ever since property prices skyrocketed with all the foreign money inflow into sg.
 
Did property agents do more work as compared to previously? 
 
For a service of convenience, there is rightly a fee to be paid. It is the quantum that most people are not happy with.

Let's not forget that  the ecosystem that the agent work in, has also gone up in price in proportion to the increase in property prices. For example, marketing expenses, which is one of their biggest cost has certainly gone up few folds compare to 10 years ago. Just take a look at PG agent subscription for example. When PG first started, I think it was $400 or $500++/year and now it is  $980/year  And that's just a basic subscription. SPH ads had also gone up in price. Flyer printouts cost had also gone up . Even the fees to join an agency has gone up. And now, there are even yearly CEA fees  etc...which add to an agent expenses. In addition  there are property related training which agents need to go through these days, Training vendors had also increase their prices.
 
Basically most service and media vendors related to real estate business had increase their prices few folds over the last 10 years, so how can the agent , who uses all these services to market and build his business, charge a fix service fee? And when the quantum goes up, number of agents go up too which means stiffer competition and hence with longer days of no closing for most agents. And as the quantum goes up, their legal risk also goes up and that should be compensated for in accordance to the quantum.
 
Just remember that the agent work that you see is just the tip of an iceberg. There is a big part that most people do not see.You do not see them rushing around for training and viewings and often sacrifices meals and drinks.. You do not see them undergoing psychology stress due to no closing for weeks and no money to bring home for months.  You do not see them getting rejection and more rejection during door knocking and cold calling, and yet appear like it will be a better day tomorrow. You do not see them being told to arrange viewings only to see that the buyer/tenant did not even come. You do not see them when they were undercut by their very own "buddy" agents. You do not see them working till 11pm or 12am trying  to seal the deal only to see it fall through the last minute, no closing, no money and end up going home facing a very unhappy spouse.. All this happens all the time and it will happen again and again in an agent's career. 
 
So if anyone think that the comm tied to quantum is too high, why not tell them try to be an agent then.  Go do the RES exam, then PM me, I will find them a mentor in any agency of their choice.

Great Idea. Have you tried writing to PG and see what they say?

That's not a good example to be frank unless ur using a really dumb agent (no offence intended), if the agent and the buyer at both at the scene any decent agent will push up the good points and play down the bad to close a sale. If the guy really not interested that cannot be helped of course to salvage the situation by showing him another unit he has at hand.
 
If there was an agent who can convince a unconvinced buyer to splash out millions on a property, its either the agent got a golden touch (I will confirm hire) or the buyer is just dam kum gong dunno what he wants.
 
 
These days the only commitment agents have is to their pockets. If they find a buyer, they will show the buyer a list of units and yours is just one of the units. The moment the buyer says he is not keen on your unit, the agent would then divert his attention to swinging the buyer to other units to earn his cobroke commission, casting your unit one side.

1 agent just needs to close 2 condo sales deals ($1mil+ each) or 4 hdb deals ($500k+ each) a year to meet a decent income of 40k to 50k in that year. Going for some months without closing is expected coz they just need to close 2 deals in January and February and shake legs for the rest of the year if they choose to.

Bro, 80% of the agents out there are either scraping by or just earn about the same as in their previous corporate job.  And considering there is no employer CPF now, they are probably making worse than before.
 
I think your statement above is better reserve for the top 20%

Let's say there are 30000 agents in Singapore, you may want to count the total number of listings in straits times and all the web portals for the entire year and ask yourself if there is any meat to go around. So you are assuming that all property listings out there are by top 20% of agents? In that case the remaining 80% should consider another job if they can't even close 2 deals a year.

There is no denying some deals get closed fast in a couple of weeks depending on the demand for the project. If a unit doesn't sell in 3 months,  chances is the agent would get sacked n he would have moved on to another condo unit.

Bro look at those listings and you will realise many are duplicates or dummy listings.
 
Just take a look at some new TOP project listings. For example OUE Twin Peaks, 462 units but PG has 700 listing for sale and 121 listing for rent. Where do you think the extra 359 units came from? And does it even make sense that all 462 units are on sale or rent?  And this is just one project example
 
And all those in other portals are just plain duplicates of what already in PG mostly.
 
Thesedays, I will take the number of listings and discount it by 2/3. So if I see a block has 30 listings, I take it that there is only 10 units genuinely on sale/rent. The other 20 are just non-exclusive agents trying their best to get buyers and hopefully get some viewing or sale. Going by my assumption, 66% of those listings will not close and end up as marketing cost with no returns.
 
So if we add in those part timer agents and lazy agents, 80% of agents out there are just scraping by is not fully untrue. I am inside the industry, I know.
 
If you don't believe me, you are welcome to join.

I am not talking about duplicate listings (who doesn't know there are plenty out there),  I am talking about genuine sales of all units in Singapore for the entire year. You dare say there is not enough to go around? I know some very average agents who have been full time for more than 10 years and never had issue closing 2 deals a year. Lazy ones hoping to make a lot of money with little effort are often the ones complaining pty agency work is tough  blah blah blah. Successful agents don't use the word "tough", they would usually say it is challenging coz they look at every unit as a challenge. Sellers or buyers are very quick to identify agents that are just in the job for a fast buck these days.

Not trying to sound pompous but if one was mid 30's, 40's with house, kids commitments 50k is not really a lot to go around. Plus no medical benefits, redundancy payouts and open to harder hits during a downturn don't exactly sound fantastic.
 
Anyway I don't have any issues about an agent commission, willing buyer willing seller. Sell a car to a 2nd hand car dealer and his profit would already be 10% or more then if self sold.
 
There was a time some unscrupulous agents would act as the buyer and low ball their own clients then flip the property those are ones to go for not a typical one earning his living thru commission.
 
Insurance agent also get a cut of your initial policy and then they get a trailing commission and that's every premium you pay for the policy (believe me its staggering). How does that stack up?

Actually I was citing the example of 2 deals (i.e. 50k com) as the barest minimum, most agents do not stop at 2 deals obviously. If an agent can close 2 deals and not work the entire year,  why are agents still griping about not being able to make ends meet,  long hours of work blah blah blah? My belief if an agent can't close 2 deals a year,  they should stop being an agent the following year and take up a day job.

Put this link from the height of the property market, average income for the agent was 13k which I too say its a lot, but frankly working a professional job for similiar length can also net similiar income. Difference is got CPF and Medical on the professional job.
 
http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/singapore-property-resources/real-estate-jobs/article/35103-how-much-does-a-real-estate-salesperson-really-earns
Based on an annual survey conducted by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and real estate recruitment company Macdonald & Co, of which results were released earlier this year, the average income of a property agent in Singapore stood at approximately $12,767 a month or about $153,207 per annum*.
 
Then you have the below where hard hit agents now become uber drivers, 30k per month to 3k per month.
http://www.straitstimes.com/business/property/hard-hit-property-agents-in-singapore-becoming-uber-drivers
 
I think that's just a reality of the business, but least as a professional one can still find alternate jobs at lower pay during the downturn.
 
Quid pro quo bah

This year which is a better year than the last, new private transactions are expected to come in at maybe 10,000 units.
 
With the 30,000 agents, one agent has 1/3 unit (assume average) for the whole year.
 
Not sure how to count HDB and resales as some choose to DIY. But I am pretty sure the number of transactions on average will not be much higher than 1 unit. Maybe some agent can advise. Add in some rental commissions...
 
And 25K commissions per unit, really not sure if it is really that high, especially if the bulk of sales come from those that cost under 1 million.
 
Still have to take away tax and other expenses like transport.
 
Really such a good deal?
I am sure there is survey bias. The survey respondents tended to be the active ones?
 
Then again, what do I know?
 

Put this link from the height of the property market, average income for the agent was 13k which I too say its a lot, but frankly working a professional job for similiar length can also net similiar income. Difference is got CPF and Medical on the professional job.
 
http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/singapore-property-resources/real-estate-jobs/article/35103-how-much-does-a-real-estate-salesperson-really-earns
Based on an annual survey conducted by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and real estate recruitment company Macdonald & Co, of which results were released earlier this year, the average income of a property agent in Singapore stood at approximately $12,767 a month or about $153,207 per annum*.
 
Then you have the below where hard hit agents now become uber drivers, 30k per month to 3k per month.
http://www.straitstimes.com/business/property/hard-hit-property-agents-in-singapore-becoming-uber-drivers
 
I think that's just a reality of the business, but least as a professional one can still find alternate jobs at lower pay during the downturn.
 
Quid pro quo bah

I am not talking about duplicate listings (who doesn't know there are plenty out there), I am talking about genuine sales of all units in Singapore for the entire year. You dare say there is not enough to go around? I know some very average agents who have been full time for more than 10 years and never had issue closing 2 deals a year. Lazy ones hoping to make a lot of money with little effort are often the ones complaining pty agency work is tough blah blah blah. Successful agents don't use the word "tough", they would usually say it is challenging coz they look at every unit as a challenge. Sellers or buyers are very quick to identify agents that are just in the job for a fast buck these days.
 
 
You need to envision agents like a company. The top 20% are often the top bosses who take the most pay. For the balance 80% , a big part are the low salary workers, followed by some average income group and finally some mid tier managers at the top of that 80%.

Haha well I used the more extreme side cause if I used some tame report it would seem I'm being baised to the agents  But I also doubt their average income bah. Then again what I know, I'm a working stiff posting on a forum haha
 

This year which is a better year than the last, new private transactions are expected to come in at maybe 10,000 units.
 
With the 30,000 agents, one agent has 1/3 unit (assume average) for the whole year.
 
Not sure how to count HDB and resales as some choose to DIY. But I am pretty sure the number of transactions on average will not be much higher than 1 unit. Maybe some agent can advise. Add in some rental commissions...
 
And 25K commissions per unit, really not sure if it is really that high, especially if the bulk of sales come from those that cost under 1 million.
 
Still have to take away tax and other expenses like transport.
 
Really such a good deal?
I am sure there is survey bias. The survey respondents tended to be the active ones?

Bro, 80% of the agents out there are either scraping by or just earn about the same as in their previous corporate job.  And considering there is no employer CPF now, they are probably making worse than before.
 
I think your statement above is better reserve for the top 20%

 
i do not know how much all agents make.. but from the few that i know, and if u are in top 20%, gross income would be above $200k.
 
The real incentive for a graduate, however, to leave corporate world for agency is to work towards being in the top 10% which would be above $500k

as always, a one-sided story. 
 
Such dispute between landlord and tenant is common. The only surprise I had is why didn't the landlord contact the tenant directly? Wouldn't that make communication much more direct and clear?
 
25 years ago, I was renting rooms and apartments. As a tenant, I had problems such as my letters being opened up by the landlord kids, my shoes got chewed by my landlord dog, and the house was accessed without me knowing (i thought got thief). Never once I contacted the landlord agent. I just contact the landlord directly and resolved the issue with him.  No emails and no watsapp back then, so, just a simple phone call and it is done.
 
Therefore when I read the case in the link above, I cringe.  Why must people make it so complicated? Landlord and tenants dispute are common and has been around for centuries, so communication and tolerance is key.

Last time people more chamsiong.  Now people damn KNN.
 
Last time my Jap tenant say aircon not cool, i replace new daikin.
He say toilet seat spoiled, i replace new seat.
 
I think the best is both tenant and landlord dont ngeow chee ngeow lan.
Give and take.  Be fair.
Steady...
 
Luckily all my tenants are steady.
Becos not steady, i wont rent.
If steady, i dont mind rent cheaper.
 
But i heard many sibei headache ones, somehow mostly coming from the cheaper condos and areas.
Rent only $3k, late payment, mess the house. Extra person staying etc.....
 
Take into consideration these things.
Its not simply numerical.
I believe its a relationship.

i think if you have an office job that pays ok, you are unlikely to be motivated to switch over to be a property agent.  there is the human inertia, there is also the part about starting from 0 as a property agent.  first 6 months you are unlikely to have any income.  i am one example.  i have been wanting to be a part-time agent for some time but have never been sufficiently motivated to really take the first step.
 
conversely, i have seen another one who lost his full-time job and took the plunge to be property agent and now looks to be happy and motivated in his property agent job

Not trying to sound pompous but if one was mid 30's, 40's with house, kids commitments 50k is not really a lot to go around. Plus no medical benefits, redundancy payouts and open to harder hits during a downturn don't exactly sound fantastic.
 
Anyway I don't have any issues about an agent commission, willing buyer willing seller. Sell a car to a 2nd hand car dealer and his profit would already be 10% or more then if self sold.
 
There was a time some unscrupulous agents would act as the buyer and low ball their own clients then flip the property those are ones to go for not a typical one earning his living thru commission.
 
Insurance agent also get a cut of your initial policy and then they get a trailing commission and that's every premium you pay for the policy (believe me its staggering). How does that stack up?

I think i go be insurance agent since i jobless.  Sounds quite lucrative leh....

But I'm just curious. Why exclude divorcee? People get divorced for all kinds of reasons, many not entirely their fault.
 
Then how about families with young kids?
 
Another case study: one of my best friend's unit was returned a few months into the tenancy rented by a married couple without children. Reason: they got into a divorce during this period.

I don't...because there is no way to verify... anyway regardless of race or nationality  there are good and bad ones... just that some have higher percentages of others ... but you will never know how good or bad until they stay in so just need do some calculated risk to minimize the percentages

Of course, but thats where we need to make certain judgement calls base on the job, marital status, nationality etc.....
 
So my point is dont just rent to anyone lah... make a good judgement call by meeting the tenant and having a chat (interview) etc.....
 
Its the same when buying used car, Rolex watch, property etc etc etc etc etc....
 
You can never be 100% sure but at least do due diligence.

True. That is why the people of these profiles find it generally harder to secure a place to stay.
 
Personally, I am quite patient in letting my agent screen for quality. No quality, I take as holiday home and enjoy. 
 
And if urgent to rent out, would rather lower price than quality. Then of course there are those who will say rental price  = quality.
 
In the end, different strategies...

Sorry i like to correct this.
What i meant by "exactly that" is the calculated risk part.
You just choose how you want to "calculate" that risk
 
There is absolutely no 100% but definitely if you engage the tenant in a simple conversation it helps in future communications and it does provide an insight to the person. Very similar to a friendly interview.
 
Thats my formula with 100% effectiveness. 
Excellent cooperative tenants who took care of my property and made it real easier when i was selling it too...

I have this issue which I hope to have a fair answer:
 
Recently, I rented out my HDB whole unit to a FT and as a landlord, I paid what is supposedly a com of half month for one year lease in accordance with the so called "TA" which I find crappy..
 
What shocked me was the Agent talk to the tenant privately (not during the signing of TA) downstair of my flat for half month com as well..
 
The Agent insist that this is a standard practice and as the tenant is a foreigner who does not quite understand the ruling, negotiated and agreed with Agent of 800 instead of 1000..after being cornered as the tenant is desparately needed a roof as the wife is expecting a child within the next couple of days, the Agent "managed" to find another co-broke to take the com as the tenant's agent.
 
By the time I knew, money has changed hand and the Agent tells me all kind of T&C but I told him that in the first place, you are not TRANSPARANT and did not display integrity, moral and good conduct professional property agent..
 
I believed many of these cases has already fall out due to the strict control by CEA but there are still some "old bird" still waiting to claw onto some ignorant non Singaporean.
 
Thank you

Agents are not suppose to take comm from both sides. If you already paid the agent his comm, then he is representing you and need to fight for your interest. PERIOD.
 
If a tenant has an agent and wanted to co-broke with your agent, then that is between them. But his first and foremost priority is to represent you and not go and negotiate another comm with the tenant either for himself or for another agent.
 
Just recently, due to some small misunderstanding with the co-broke agent (Landlord agent) , I decided not to take comm  just to ensure that my tenant has a place that he loves and could fit into his budget. Sometimes as an agent, such situation happens and I rather sacrifice comm than to compromise promises and integrity.  Money can always earn back, there will always be another deal somewhere out there.

In theory, you are correct..
 
But if you ever walk into CEA office, you will know why I say that it's a waste of time with the answer I get:
 
We will review and feedback in a couple of months after investigating.
 
It's best you sort out yourself
 
Speak to the company the Agent represent
 
The latest I heard from the CEO of my case, he said that CEA now only handles critical or complex issues (that means mine is not) to elimates the complaints from the public....
 
With these, I feel that CEA is just like CASE.......
 
Anyway, I have learnt my lesson and hope that those out there whether to engage Agent or not, just be careful as there are still many crooks hidden in the dark awaiting for suckers.....

I believe it boils down to public education. The apparent opaque the process, exaggerated complexity of process and the impetus of the CEA to help public knows what entails in property transaction and eliminate fear of something goes wrong with signing on the dotted line, are some reasons why after so many years we are still where we are with little progress.
 
It also sometimes marvel at the way some of property buyers (self stay or investors) carry out their property transaction. Some of these buyers when they buy a can of food which cost a few dollars, they will check where they are made, expiratory date, any rust on the can and some got the extreme and examine the nutritional value BUT when come to their property transaction which may cost a million dollars and up, they just leave everything to their agent.  
 
Hence, property buyer and seller also have their responsibility and since it is their money and property. If they don't look after their own asset, do you expect others to look after for you.

Yes, I did and went to CEA office and all I hear was from the recep telling this...that and I was so fedup that I say:
 
CEA is a Toothless Tiger.....and she diam diam
 
From there, I knew that org is just another wayang company set up by the garmen...because in the past, there were too many ah beng scamming many poor chaps for easy money / com.

 
i'm quite surprised. I know if you can bring in evidence for CEA they will surely whack the errant agent.
 
Even simple stuff like distributing flyers to doorstep or calling people who registered for DNC will kanna whack

   Dear Wyfitms,
 
   Do refrain for using harsh words : " Whack errant agent " Kanna whack ", the world is a very cruel place to live, work and play, pls be mindful of such words on human being, after all, being errant is ignorant, being greedy is greed and being if one point one finger at the accused, 9 other fingers will be pointing back at you.

I was equally surprised especially after hearing from the reponse from a recep..
 
A complete sets of evidence was with me and I was in doubt if the recep is qualified to understand or verify the contents...
 
Finally, the recep tai-chi the case.....

All,
 
I am glad this has generated so much attention...
 
Initially, I have been in touch with the so called "Senior Associate Director" designation whom I feel has poor command of spoken and written English and decided to give up because I feel that claw back of the additional payment (800) is not worth my time.
 
It's not the money but the principle of the profession.
 
Subsequently, I escalate this to the company CEO and it looks like he also don't have much control over the Agent (old bird) behavior in terms of conduct, moral and integrity with both sides of the story..
 
I told the CEO that on documents, everything is norm and acceptable and indeed looks okay but when I found out that the Agent is doing additional tasking behind me, then I feel that it is no longer okay.....and the CEO also agreed with what I said.
 
I also told him I met a couple of other agents and they were upfront on the com even before any viewing.....no if or but...
 
I told him that I may extend to the press to highlight the continued monkey business in which I have zero tolerance in today standard set out by CEA.
 
I will try to get in touch with reporters who are willing to hear this juicy story with the intend to sound out to the folks that are still ignorant and taken for a ride by these crook agent.
 
Lastly, I told the CEO that if this goes to the press, no names nor company will be announced....

Some agents are just AH. They will deliberately persuade sellers to press prices below valuation so as to make it easy for them to close the deal, depressing prices for the project. This is the problem when you give agents the monopoly to advertise online. Think MND seriously needs to put a stop to "agent only" online advertising portals.

brother, 
 
DIY not an issue.  the issue is the avenue to market the property.  pptyguru does not allow home owners to list their property.  i doubt 99.co would too.
 
what you are left with are
1) SPH Cats
2) Carousell
3) Gumtree
 
seriously the last 2 avenues are very limited in exposure.  as for SPH Cats, although it is decent, it would have generated much less leads considerably than online ones in modern day economy.  even if we can agree to settle for Cats, it still requires more effort (to do listing every sat) and may only attract very old buyers who doesn't use online portals these days.

In my opinion, agents also need to eat so if you are able to give a little, I do not see why you should not engage an agent to service you.
An agent, in general, can help post more listings for you (At agent's own cost (few hundreds to thousands) until case is closed). With more listing, you can sell faster or even at a higher price or meet more clients before deciding. 
 
Without an agent, you may save on the agent's fee (2k++) but what if the property transacted at 20k lower due to less coverage? Of course, there are unscrupulous agents around but there are also some good ones...

There is one agent by the name of Beverly who shamelessly takes com from seller as well as buyer last time. She even advised the new buyer landlord to rent out whole unit before MOP n don't declare to HDB.
 
i wonder if this Beverly is the same one which i encountered 3 months when i was very keen on a hdb...
 
but LOL.. thanks to her, i got a better deal elsewhere..
 
till today that unit still on market.. at reduced selling price..

just to add on this commission discussion..
 
 
i find this co-broke scheme only to the benefit of the agent's interest..
 
 
generally a $10,000 increase in selling price only translates to roughly $100 gain (or less due to profit-share with company) in commission for 1 agent..
 
so how happens if you're a buyer and the seller's agent refuses a co-broke with own agent?..
 
lo behold, 99% your agent is gonna tell you.. sorry but your choice unit has been sold..
 
while in fact it hasn't..
 
there are some nice experiences i learnt while looking and buying a property for own stay..

Her surname starts with the 8th letter of the alphabet series. Probably the same agent you experienced. Better warn others.

experience of my recent rental deal.  some agents will not deal with other agents at the detriment of their client landlord. my observations include:.
 
1) some agents will tell co-broking agents who called up that the unit is rented out already or not even respond if it is a sms even though unit is still available
2) some bait-and-switch agent will also tell a co-broking agent the unit is rented out.  they don't want the co-broke agent to hang around to possibly find out more
3) these bait-and-switch agent will be very friendly and helpful if the caller is direct tenant.  ie they hope to intro you a comparable unit (another development) they have or represent you in securing a tenancy (ie can collect co-broke) commission.

You can reduce the risk of this by letting the agent know they are working on a non-exclusive basis. This way, they will at least have some worry that some other agent could close the deal before them.

actually to direct tenant me, there is no risk although i find that it is a hassle to go through agent and may end up paying more (due to service fees clause if tenancy only 1 year).
 
if you are referring to me as a landlord, i will say better not give exclusive these days or not leave everything to your exclusive agent.  he could be up to some hanky panky behind your back, like those cases i witnessed as prospective tenant.  but to do it myself is also not easy.  so i can understand if your advice is for me to give non-exclusive to agents.
 
but the thing i couldn't agree most is, the agent would insert a clause into your tenancy agreement that every renewal they are entitled to commission. maybe it is worthwhile doing our own or not use the tenancy agreement template of the agency.

In my opinion, agents also need to eat so if you are able to give a little, I do not see why you should not engage an agent to service you.

i can mostly agree to paying agency commission for the real good work done.
 
the only thing i cannot agree is why every renewal of the tenancy by same tenant we still must pay same level of commission when the work done is next to 0.

This sorta things usually happens to private property because seller only pays commission usually. So co-broke means less for the seller’s agent to earn ..
 
So of course it means I tell the enquiring buyer agent the unit is gone!.. LOL
 
 
 
There is one particular unit with perculiar renovation pillars!!.. listed for a very long time until there are least 15 repeated listings by all different agents.. LOL
 
Not sure when it’s gonna be sold.

is a listing for sale right?
 
some of such units, i do pity the agent.  but still, they have a choice to turn it down actually.  anyhow, agent buys credits for advertisement from pptyguru for a package fee.  the loss is less painful because the apportioned cost per listing is not very high plus it ought to be sufficiently covered by the advertisements of the units that were successfully sold or tenanted out.

Whether is investments or other matters, I do myself due diligence and DIY. Unless I do not have the knowledge, I will hunt around from varies sources. So is again due diligence.
 
I never fund managers or bankers take a cent from me.
 
Over and over again, we see too many cases happening, second to second-hand car dealers.Of course, there are a small group of genuine and honest agents. Again, if you let them, you just have to hope and pray, is fine.

Moreover,  if they want to micro manage every single aspect of the agent's work,  CEA would need a team of at least 500 staff.  Currently,  you send them a complaint about one bogus ad and they will drag their feet and take ages to investigate just that one case.

The commission taken by royal movers is very minimum up to the mark so that the common man does not feel misused as in majority of agents take very high commissions. They also provide a fast shifting company service which allows access to easily move stuff here and there.

Yes it is.......
 
Refusal to co-broke is a violation, unless it is clearly specified by the client that the agent cannot co-broke.  However, there is really no reason why a client will specify it that way.
 
I see a lot of post here condemning agents poor ethics and stuff.
 
Sure, there is some of them, but from my experience on the ground, most agents are alright. They are pretty respectful, punctual and responsive to co-broke. Only a very small handful that sometimes either very slow or not responsive.

On the surface they are respectful,  but behind your back they will do all kinds of nonsense. What they say to other cobroke agents at the expense of their sellers can be really shocking.

It is simple.
 
He wants to make sure that when comes to renewal, you will look for him. Or if the tenancy will end, he gets to know first since tenant will contact him.
 
If landlord and tenant contact each other directly, the agent will be out of the loop and there goes his renewal or possible business in helping you to get a new tenant when tenancy ends.
 
If it is me, it doesn't matter. If landlord is my client, I will be happy to provide the tenant contact if he wants.

When contract is signed,  it is your right to have the contact info of the tenant coz the agent is legally not even a party to the contract. I think CEA should give this agent a screwing.

Depends who the agent represents actually.
 
if the agent represents landlord and dealing with a direct tenant, then yes, landlord has the right to get the contact from his agent if he so wishes.
 
If the agent represents tenant (agent takes comm from tenant) ,  and dealing with a direct landlord, then the agent has no obligation to provide tenant contact to landlord unless the tenant agrees to it.
 
If both side have agents, then very unlikely that landlord and tenant's contact will be exchanged because both landlord and tenants expects their respective agents to work with one another to solve their tenancy issues or disputes. 
 
However in every cases, if both landlord and tenant happen to meet and willing to exchange contact after some small talk, then it is entirely up to them regardless whether they have agents or not.

It is illegal and unethical for either landlord or tenant's agent to withhold any information from either the tenant or the landlord. Whether agent for tenant or landlord, neither are party to the contract,  so their job ends the moment they bring landlord and tenant together. The landlord must always remember that he has the absolute right to know everything there is to know about his tenant including contact info.

This is what an agent would have people believe. 
The fact is that an agents job is complete and they are entitled to the commission after the tenancy agreement is signed. If they are disputes after that and the agents try to resolve it, it is due to good will (for future business).
 
So if the agent doesn't give me the tenants contact details and the tenant doesn't pay the rent, can I claim the rental from the agent?

Another trick by unscrupulous agents. They will try to add in a clause where they are due a commission if the tenant renews (even though they do absolutely nothing other than calling to ask the tenant intends to renew). One should always read all the documents carefully and cross out such a clause before signing.

The agent need to spell that out if there is a renewal commission clause in there! Infact, he should go through every clause with the client before the service agreement is signed.

That's how it should be.
 
By left, the agent starts bringing people to view once you agree via sms or verbally on the commission terms. No service agreement signed at all (probably signed at the same time as the tenancy agreement).

Pay renewal fees, agents are expected to follow up throughout the lease term. 
No pay renewal fees, agent job ends when the contract is signed. Is up the parties whether they want the services of their respective agents.

I had such requirement taken off on 2 occasion as I asked why and the agent cannot provide me a specific scope...so I say .....no need.
 
On the same note, I suggested a meeting with the tenants and the agent involved but I was told...sorry no time.
 
Lucky I took off the renewal agreement as I knew many will wash their hands once the com is issued.

If you have the renewal clause in an agreement, is there also a clause that states that the agent will follow up throughout the lease. If it is just "expected", then by the same logic, also no need to have the renewal clause in the lease because it can also be "expected".
 
Contractually, if the clause included, agent can expect to do nothing and also collect renewal $$$.

you can ask to cancel the renewal clause. All my rentals is stated no commission for renewal... in fact for individual once lease is up we don't even bother ask them renew, just common understanding that 1 month notice need to be given...

Many agents are just preying on the ignorance of landlords,  tenants,  sellers and buyers. Many people still don't know about agents not being allowed to collect com from landlord n tenant,  buyer and seller under dual  representation. I think the govt should have a campaign to weed out unethical agents.

Why not? When you get conned of thousands of dollars, I am sure many people would, unless of course the victim doesn't mind being charitable to the agent.

maybe seller realised cannot get her asking price after waiting so many months so decide to sell now
 
also possible that for some reason,seller needs to sell now and financially they were better off 6 months ago
 
6 months is a very long time...

I really dont mind paying the property agent their commission but too often ending up me doing nearly all the work to promote the property. Eg suggest to sell property 10-20 below valuation - i can do it myself then, to increase sale prosper ask me to stage home with rental furniture, etc.

I agree. Was renting out a studio. Agent asked me to get it fully furnished for viewings (bed + fridge) which is silly because the tenant didn't want all those.
 
Good thing I did not listen to him.

How would you know that the prospective tenant would not want those at the beginning of the marketing of the unit?

I don't.
 
That's why it is better not to have it. If the fellow wants, we can provide (depending on how we negotiate the price). If he doesn't want and I have it, then gotta sell or throw away?

Used furniture these days so cheap if buying for tenants. Just look at what people on carousell are selling,  often cheaper than the moving cost.

It's not just about the price but the hassle.
 
For me, I'm only trying to rent out a studio and not asking for above market prices so it ain't worth the hassle of bring 2nd hand furniture and then having to resell it if the tenant doesn't need it.
 
For me, the room is right there for the prospective tenant to see. If they say they want a fridge, I will say I can provide one. If they want to buy their own fridge, even better.

I would leave it unfurnished first and if tenant wants it furnished,  I can get the house furnished in under a week for few hundred bucks (sofa,  fridge, tv,  washer,  tables,  chairs n beds).

I think the agent is advising from experience point of view in terms of speed of renting it out.
 
In Singapore, most tenants looking for studio or 1-bedder is expecting the unit to be fully furnished.  On the other hand, for 2 or 3 bedders, they mostly want it to be partially furnish meaning just white goods and no furniture.
 
And it is understandable. Tenants looking for studio/1-bedder are mostly foreign singles or couples.  They just want to move in and stay without the hassle of lugging furniture around.
 
Tenants looking for bigger units are families, either expat families or locals. These guys have their own furniture so they prefer units that are partially furnished.
 
Of course, there will always be some tenants who are exception to the above, but if a landlord want to rent out fast, then he should follow the general trend to capture a larger tenant pool.
 
So I guess your agent is just advising from observation and experience., ultimately it is up to you.

If yes is it legal?

Is the agent your agent or seller's agent?
 
If it is your agent then it is of course legal because there is no such thing as a regular commission. the % commission is always supposed to be a negotiation between yourself and the agent (can be anything from 0% to 10000% or even more  ).
 
If it is the seller's agent then it is against some law and you can definitely report him.

90210 has collected commission from buyers before even though representing seller. This is one of the most jialat agent that ever existed in Singapore. The money was requested in cash so there won't be any trace. Someone I know was involved in the transaction.
