Some say dryer is good to have some say no. I am kind of torn to get a dryer. 

What I found from my friend was, after the cloth came out from washer and throw into dryer. It will come out from dryer very fluffy and soft. I like the touch. 
 

What say you guys?

you will appreciate when the rainy days come, but not when the bill comes  to save $$, let your wet clothes hang over night b4 going into the dry, to make it soft. ( 90min vs 20min)

use it wisely and you can be a happy man, rain or shine.

yes, the current 1000+ rpm spin dry cycles are POWER! it literally dry to the touch.

But wo sunshine + indoor air drying, the damp smell will still exist, no matter wat detergent you used. only way to beat it is a dryer + "dryers" paper .

In SG, even during monsoon, you have at least half the day sunny and you want to deplete energy quicker, accelerate carbon footprint. In other parts of the world, bo pian, no sun for several months. Besides, like some bro said, dryer does damage to some fabric, .. sigh ..

Just get it lah.

$400 money well spent.

Helps to dry the clothes faster.

Even can dry your shoes and dry nuts and make crispy apple chips. Just have to get the dryer that can insert a stationary tray inside the dryer!
 

I have being using it for the past 10 years.....can't imagine life without it anymore.

My washing machine came with the drying function. End up never use cuz when want to dry only can half load. So end up we just hang at the open area in the house rather than use the dryer. Got the machine with the dryer at first thought then can convert the open area for other uses.

In the Northern parts of USA, & other temperate countries, there is not enough sunlight & heat during teh colder months, & a wet clothes can end up damage from being iced when hang outside.

Exactly. In those countries, you have climate control, not just for own comfort, but to prevent the pipes from freezing up. In SG, there's no such issue.

For washing normal clothes i never had to use the dryer, even if it's raining whole day.  But it's very useful for bedsheets n towels. These take alot of space to hang dry,  which i simply don't have in the apartment (those stay landed no problem lah).  Getting the sheets n towels thoroughly dry is also good cos these r stored away.  If even slightly damp n u keep,  its gonna smell.

I'm using Samsung 2 in1, model WD8804CJZ. 8kg washer, 4 kg dryer, made in Korea. Gentle on clothes n durable. Washer spins almost 5x a week, if not everyday. Use since Sept 2010, n occassionally use dryer function. It's pretty good so I would recomnend it. Made in Korea washer is pretty durable, my last LG made in Korea 6g washer lasted 6years while spinning 4-5x per week, and only belting is misaligned n starts jumping. I throw it away when sell house. Take note, for LG or Samsung, if made in Korea, the label on the appliance will state made in Korea. If its says made by LG or Samsung, then its made in China or other countries.

To me its no good. 

Cos usually the drying capacity is half of the washing capacity. Meaning if u wash a full load, say 8kg, at the end of the wash cycle u need to take out 4kg put one side, wait 1 hr then swap. Troublesome la. And electricity consumption is x2 cos dry twice.

If want to buy dryer, buy the standalone type. To save space get a proper wall-mounted rack for the dryer, mount on top of washer. Do not to stack dryer directly on the washer unless they are designed as a stackable pair.

Oh yes totally agree with this. In the first winter while living overseas, i hung my clothes outside, they ended up very dry and also very hard and "crispy" if u know what i mean. The T-shirts can stand upright on the floor.  No wonder my neighbour arm-chio when he saw me hanging the clothes.

Its depends on whether the sun shine in your laundry area or not 
 

If it shines, then no need dryer.
 

I bought a LG washer with dryer built in. Using it for 5 years Liao. But I never need to use the dryer function coz my laundry area always get the sun every day. I even find it too hot.  And I always hand my clothes indoors 100%. Never hang outdoor

My personal thoughts.
 

The architects are striving to provide a clean and uncluttered facade for the individual blocks. Hence, the bamboo poles are now hidden within the many crevices and recesses of the building. They may have been thinking of safety too. The old bamboo pole was just secured by the metal hoist, making the bamboo pole effectively a cantilever. I notice that the newer designs provides hard points at both ends of the bamboo poles which will make it a must to locate the clothes drying area within the many recesses of the building.

New HDB no natural sunlight. Service yard all shaded unless certain stacks.

And no one is home in the office hours, how to even catch a bit of sunlight. 
 

Hang dry in service yard  maybe few wks wont have smell initially, but after a few months, ur clothes will smell musty. Especially stuff u don't wear every week.
 

I will get a dryer but not use for every single wash.

The solution is service balcony with access to sunshine. The service balcony basically is sheltered, but without high walls obstructing structures. Abolish the old bamboo poles hanging method. It amazed me that with so many years of building public housing, we still cannot get it right.

1) gas heater cannot be placed in the toilet but can be placed in kitchen. so need to lay hot water pipe from heater to shower head. the longer this pipe, the longer the delay in getting hot water  
 

how i overcome this: i use the initial cold water to brush teeth. after the intial cold water is used, no problem already
 

2) mickey mouse water pressure cannot activate gas heater......if cold cold day but water pressure chui, good luck   
 

i dont have a probelm with this. i stay top floor
 

3) requires a certain min amount of gas pressure to operate.....if hot day but you still want a warm shower but not too hot, you have to adjust the gas input to the min. if it is still too hot, you have to add cold water at the tap mixer stage when you bath. 
 

Problem: when you add too much cold water at the tap mixer stage, the amount of hot water being churn out by the water heater is decreased. when it is decreased to below a certain amount of pressure, the hot water gets cut off.    1 min later then you realise no hot water because there is still hot water in the hot water pipe between the heater and the tap 
 

to resolve this, i use a 2 tap mixer (not those comnbined types). somehow less problem with heater cutting off supply
 

advantage: save marnie!

Sounds like why i prefer a instant water heater in the morning.

I'm those type, switch on, straight away shower type. Cos my morning timing is tight so that i maximise zzz time  
 

Now i got storage heater at my parent's place, so that one my dad will switch on 10-15mins before i wake up for work.

It's ok like that but quite waste the heating capacity once i move to my own place. Cos only i shower in the mornings

Use Top washing powder. Formulated for indoor drying, now with anti dustmite formulation. Never hung out clothes to dry for 14 years. No smell issue with clothes as long as there is good air flow in drying area. No need for dryer which takes up space and up your electricity bills, esp with rising electricity tariffs.
 

NB: I don't work for Lion Corp. Just sharing a good product I use.

I am using a dryer and have no regrets. It is especially useful when you have a baby as they change at least 2-3 sets of clothes a day.
 

Pros

- clothes can be washed and dry within 3 hours

- good for rainy weather

- negligible increase to the utilities bill
 

Cons

- some fabric might be damaged from the heat and tumbling

Some say dryer is good to have some say no. I am kind of torn to get a dryer. 

What I found from my friend was, after the cloth came out from washer and throw into dryer. It will come out from dryer very fluffy and soft. I like the touch. 
 

What say you guys?

gas one $800   , crazy man! unless the gas one can tong 10 year, you one week use one time, maybe can recoup the savings from gas 
 

but gas water heater is quite a differrent story  




That's true for the high end energy savings dryer (heat pump type), unless you run a laundry shop, the extra you pay over a less energy saving model is more than the power consumption that you are ever gonna save unless you dried the whole block's laundry...

Mine's just a basic dryer.  Set heat to either Medium or High and turn the knob to set the time.  That's it.

Really meh?  I think the electrical bills will be high for an electric dryer.   I wanted to get one last year after my baby was born, but ultimately decided against it because i felt that i could do with "solar" drying =p   Anyway, NEA's website has a comparison of various electrical bills for dryers, can be quite useful comparison if anyone is getting an electric dryer.

i got a dryer and its the best piece of equipment i got at home...
 

imagine raining days or current lousy house facing with no direct sun through out the day... dryer is a life saver... 
 

i got for myself a bosch condenser dryer which make the clothes fluffy and smooth and smelling sunshine fresh... so a good dryer is very important... my sis's basic dryer made the clothes hard and crumpled... making ironing after a chore
 

Sometime i use it to wash and dry my canvas bag... i used it to wash and dry my wifey softtoys... i even wash and dry my converse sneaker...
 

next house i will definitely be getting a dryer washer set again and i'm going miele!

ya 3880 for a washer and a dryer... if u get it during the tangs sale u can get 12% citi credit rebate plus additional 10% discount... 
 

the drum design is different... i used my bosch with a smooth drum design sometime it still make small holes in my clothes... my sis's basic dryer from electrolux making hers worst...
 

the price different is u now got a machine that can clean many things... they got this rack for cleaning and dryer sneaker... if wifey got those expenses silk or satin dress... miele is the way to go...
 

vacuum cleaner i got a miele too... comparing the hepa filter with bosch or philips etc u can see the difference in quality and fitting... see the review online and u find that the exhuast air from a miele vacuum is cleaner than most air purifier haha... 
 

its the ease of use and other simple thing that make using them so much more happy experience...

haha bro mustank, my wife stopped ironing my t-shirts and bermuda since we got the dryer... the only one she iron is my work clothes and its jus to straighten the collar and iron out the straight lines
 

the different is condenser dryer steam the clothes while drying it... that how they manage to soften the fabric and remove the crease... the effect is like using a steam iron  
 

but not cheap... prepare to look at $1600 to $2000 a piece

I'm using Samsung 2 in1, model WD8804CJZ. 8kg washer, 4 kg dryer, made in Korea. Gentle on clothes n durable. Washer spins almost 5x a week, if not everyday. Use since Sept 2010, n occassionally use dryer function. It's pretty good so I would recomnend it. Made in Korea washer is pretty durable, my last LG made in Korea 6g washer lasted 6years while spinning 4-5x per week, and only belting is misaligned n starts jumping. I throw it away when sell house. Take note, for LG or Samsung, if made in Korea, the label on the appliance will state made in Korea. If its says made by LG or Samsung, then its made in China or other countries.
 

 
Thanks bro...will check it out.

Never wear work shirt for ages. But should be no problem la. The dryer will not damage the shirts, can set to medium heat and shorter drying time.
 

Esp year end like this period which is always raining, the dryer will be very useful.

My washer comes with drying function but I opt for Rinnai gas dryer as running cost is still cheaper (compared electric tariff vs gas).  Plus maintenance must easier. (air vent directed at my indoor dryg poles for days when i wash thicker laundry like blankets & bedsheets. Furthermore, removal of lint is much easier).  1wk I do 9 loads of laundry.  Luckily I used gas or else my utility bill would be much higher.

Its true for me. The benefit of having a dryer is not to dry my cloths quickly but to eliminate ironing totally. I recommend this if you have space next to the washing machine.
 

I used a dryer and never had to do any ironing. My ironing board is tucked away in the storeroom and my iron was spoil 2 years ago and I did not replace it. I have been using a separate dryer for more than 10 years. Its a Electrolux bought at around $500 from Courts. Allows me to wash and dry within 2-2.5 hours. My work cloths (shirts and pants) are all 'Wrinkle free'. Once it comes out of the dryer, I hang it up without any ironing and the next morning they straighten (after it comes out of the dryer there is still a little crisp) and I wear them. Today, many work shirts in the market are 'wrinkle free' as compare to years ago. It may cost a little more but worth it as it saves ironing. It also works for my T-shirts and casual weekend cloths. Note that this do not work for cotton material as cotton cloths still comes out wrinkles. Unfortunately I also cannot comment on women's or child's cloths as I live alone. Electricity cost increase is negligible.
 

I won't recommend the 2 in 1 wash and dry type. They cost more and the drying capacity is lower and the total wash + dry time is longer, as many have commented here. They may have some damped 'feeling' as after drying, there is some water left in the compartment in some crevices. My brother's family use a 2 in 1 and has this problem and end up they do not utilize the dryer all the time. A separate dryer is larger and can hold 5-7 kg, the same load as the washing machine so there is no need to split the drying. I have never an issue with my cloths smelling damp or moist. Sometimes I use a sheet of 'bounce' (purchased from NTUC) to make the cloths smell nicer.
 

My female colleague is considering buying a dryer after learning from me that I never had to iron my work cloths and they look straight. She was complaining to me that she has to iron her hubbies work cloths every day and its a chore.

Today papers Harvey Norman advertising the Electrolux dryer for $349. It is good enough for drying most of the clothes.
 

Do take note there are two kind of dryer, Venting and Condensed. If venting, you need to put the dryer near a window so that the hot air can expel outside thru' the hose.
 

If condensed, I think no need. Please correct me if I am wrong.
 

You can also get Bounce or Downy dryer sheet from NTUC to soften your clothes and give it a nice smell.

ok after doing some reading online, seems that vented is actually more appropriate for our tropical climate!
 

Main advantage of condenser would be that self contained, no need to have ugly hose venting out the air. So more suitable for homes in temperate countries say during winter time
 

Venting easier to clean, just clean the hose

Condensing have to clean the water storage unit.

I'm not a heavy user so gas vs electricity differences not much bah.

And now citygas don't really have promo for their gas dryer. So at $780+ vs the 500+ for the more energy efficient ones (F&P and Electrolux based on Harvey norman/courts price) vs the cheaper 2 ticks type which is abt $400+. Can't really make up the difference.
 

If there is a roadshow, then will consider bah. I don't like running gas pipe into the service yard also.

Did that for years in Melbourne. If you want those lines on your shirts etc, then you'll have to do a little ironing to get them as well as to starch collars but for most stuff your don't need to.
