The Iskandar Malaysia properties are also in a bubble stage quietly. But no one mention that. Back 5-6 years, bought a landed property, before the the announcement of the Iskandar development, it cost me RM350+k for a 2500sqft. Now my property worth almost RM1.8mil to 2mil. Damn scary. I have checked , the real increase in population of this state was pretty stagnant. Those would have bought up the prices, are mainly Singaporeans and some nationals. I have also talked to my agent in JB, the real appreciation of the prices across JB is pretty modest.  Most in this area are buy and stay forever. So for those who plan to invest in the Iskandar region, be-careful. Many buy condos and promised a view to Singapore, but some have lost value, due to another new development blocking those condos. Lastly, I realized the area just opposite of Singapore waters( Nusajaya )have become more congestion, once these new developments are up. Many buy to rent out, but some have negative yield returns.

yup its the newbies to boleh property which r buying now. Ive more frens who regret buying boleh property than not. My relative has a condo in KLCC says dam hard to rent out n rental also dismal returns. Construction quality in boleh is 1 level lower than SG too... not forgetting ringgit keep falling so if u accounted for FX loss, its not good return liao
 

Old timers will tell u boleh property isnt for investment, instead is ok for ownstay n use. Theres so much land there!!!
 

also wanna add that boleh banks have been giving 90% finance for property for awhile liao... this kinda financing is highly inflationary n precedes bubble bursts...

Not realistic.
 

Properties in Iskandar and pretty much other areas of Malaysia are hyped up. Those that are beside KLCC offers a better chance of retaining value.

I would not mention the name, but is under SP Setia. My currently rental yield is about 13 - 14%. Based on the price I purchased. It's pretty good returns, after adjusted RM regression over the last 6 years. I am planning to realize it soon. But if you ask me to invest now, is a no no.

Yup. you right. It's artificially inflated by overseas' buyers. This was mainly due to the exchange rate. I am a little on this coming GE. Last GE, the BN had marginally win. But this time round, looks a little worry.

No Lah. 90% finance are for the citizens. Not for Singaporeans. That period, properties in JB was dirt cheap. Ended up paid 70% in cash and balance loan of about 4.5% - 5% for 4 years.

Another thing about Iskandar Malaysia properties. Some developers ever promise you, they will help you to rent out for the first 2 -4 years. After 4 years. how? Can you get the same returns? The Iskandar maybe another Cyberjaya. Who knows.
 

Not forgetting, the zoning of Iskandar is not clear either. One of my business associate had setup plant in Iskandar zone, initially claimed to be exempted from bumiputras. Ended up the area is under bumiputras. Now the company still appealing to varies gov. agencies.

if u bot in 2003-2007 lor. That time klcc still 500-600psf, then jump to 1300psf, now back down here n there. Many made $$ in the regional prop boom, thats y when they see prices now, they thk its too high. I can tell u u will never know when itll crash, it may be much later than expected, such is d nature of secular bull mkts.
 

but i agree not to buy MY prop now, instead prefer KLSE stocks since that has fallen recently due to GE risk.

The concession holder GCD Medini belongs to Mubadala and 2 other shareholders. They're just concession holders to sell the land. Don't control development matters

The question is, there is so many new Condos projects but who live in. I heard most rent out. Sustainable at that rental rate. I doubt so.

I've seen interviews of Francis Yeoh on with Christine Tan (on I think CNBC). He sounds highly intelligent and business savvy. But unfortunately his property division people aren't up to par.

Yes. And I personally feel that the business model of developing and then BUILDING the development all in house is wrong.
 

Developer side: Needs to be quality s h i t... workmanship etc etc
 

Construction side: Needs to cut cost as much as possible
 

Both are mutually exclusive. And I know they have a problem with this. Both reports to the same boss! Internal conflict over business objectives!

ok lar, some contractors have recently also become developers and have churned out respectable quality homes.
 

It works if the builder is big enough and has the expertise to provide quality work at lower price. Otherwise, better off to engage 3rd party builders
