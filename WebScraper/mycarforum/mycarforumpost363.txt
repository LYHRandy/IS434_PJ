	But with higher grants (and higher income ceilings) this would also mean that ECs can be sold at a higher price, which in turn, produces more profit for the developers. Well, not just ECs, but even the BTOs at GSW as unveiled by our PM recently.


	So, prices go up, but, the government would also be able to say that they're helping the lower income by giving more grants. =X

	Are they assuming people marry later nowadays and therefore have higher income?


	The revisions in the grants hardly reflect the rate of increase in income since their last revision.


	I really hope the policy turns out well, otherwise the average low income couples will have a  hard time fighting with more above-average income earners for hdb flats.

	precisely. raising limit and grant is to “raise” the affordability bar. it is not to bring down prices. 


	to manage affordability is either reduce the size or allow higher income to buy

	1. ah gong raise the income ceiling is good, proves they listen to public feedback. many already complain cannot afford to bring family go atas restaurant jiak garlic bread, pasta and fish&chip but there are many good food in hawker. they shut the door and do not allow people (above $12K) go there makan


	2. now with higher income family come into hawker, it makes hawker food looks affordable


	3. subsequently, some hawker will also raise their price with higher affordability now  .... huat ah!


	my question:


	why set an upper limit since 80% of sporean live in hdb?


	setting an upper limit is to punish people to save money and live frugally?


	are we in a situation that bto is way under supply? the over-subscription news is always for the "hot area" bto project which is perceived as "lottery" bto


	the argument is scare "rich" people buy bto and flip to make profit


	that's the wrong policy that treating bto as a commodity to flip like share  .... need to fix this policy and not "eligibility" of true buyers who want to buy and live in hdb


	rich people already flipping bto and ec by sponsoring their kids ... so what say you?

	Interestingly, the last revision of the cap was around GE 2015.


	It did not move prices in any specific directions for a couple of years while the demand gets fulfilled and supply gets soaked up.


	The supply felt much higher at that period though.

	Whether the youngster is graduate or non graduate, overall starting pay or salary now is higher la. It is the group of people who have been in the work life for 15 years above, many of them their salary gap between these youngsters are quite close lo. Unless you are in manager post or higher, then salary could be better.

	True also. Higher starting salary also means salary increased faster. Many who are in their early 30s now already earning a salary of at least $4k or more, even a diploma holder! Very close or not far from people who have been working at least 15 years or more. Lol.

	A grant is really a grant.


	Although it is not a discount.


	If get 80,000 grant, would have saved about 28,000 over 25 years at 2.6% interest rate. No loss with returning the 80,000 25 years later.


	Grant need to pay interest or not, that one need to check. 


	But even if need to pay back, still nothing lost as money becomes much smaller after 25 years.

	Yes, in the form of CPF grant, so in fact you will be taking out the money from your CPF which would have earned interest if left inside. So upon sale, put back the grant  + interest to your CPF account. still your money.

	A relative of mine is not too affected. Too little still.😅


	When he wanted to buy a brand new HDB unit, he dun qualify for any grants and cannot take HDB loan, can only loan from external banks. His income ceiling too high. 


	2 options for him. Go buy HDB resale with external bank loan or buy PC. He bought PC not because he atas or rich but there was a period when HDB owners think got gold/diamond mines and even an oil field in their units.


	He said some units with original condition from day one but asking $30k cov. Some abit more reno but done 3-5 years ago were asking min $50k cov. Yet some asking $80k - $120k cov because got a tiny pocket sea view that one needs a binocular to see clearly. Those with nice sea view or unblocked views can be $100k cov onwards.


	If he had bought any of these he foresee having to fork out another $20k minimum for renovations. Some units will need $40-60k for flooring hacking, kitchen revamp, windows renewals or change, electrical wiring renew, toilet bowls changed etc. 


	So buying a brand new PC was a more prudent way for him as he can use his CPF and minimal cash upfront. Currently monthly loan instalments is thru CPF. Zero cash needed to service the loan.


	That's his views. He's happy in his current home. No intention to sell or jump to a HDB for now.


	Maybe when prices goes up much higher like some bros are predicting then he will sell for a good profit n downgrade for retirement. Practical fellow. Live within his means and eyes no green.


	Hehe...i just glad we are able to have a roof over our heads. Asians tend to prefer ownership of our houses then the angmos who are ok with renting apartments very long term.


	Just yada-ing and sharing. Hopefully more ppl are able to benefit from latest changes.


	Safe ride


	Cheers

	Likely u have met the withdrawal limit that's why the rest in cash. If BTO no issue
	CPF Withdrawal Limit


	Based on whether you are buying a new HDB flat, resale flat or a private property, the Valuation Limit or the Withdrawal Limit may apply.


Valuation Limit is the lower of the purchase price or valuation at the time of purchase.
	

Withdrawal Limit is the maximum amount of CPF you can use for your home, currently capped at 120% of the Valuation Limit.

	Only applicable for BTO if under Bank loan. For BTO most will be taking HDB loans for first timer.

	I think its a ploy to increase price.


	Last time HDB cannot use CPF to buy so they cannot sell you what you cannot afford.


	After able to use CPF, price shoot up and your CPF is stuck in HDB. 


	Less money for retirement unless you migrate to lower cost country

			Likely u have met the withdrawal limit that's why the rest in cash. If BTO no issue
			CPF Withdrawal Limit
		

			Based on whether you are buying a new HDB flat, resale flat or a private property, the Valuation Limit or the Withdrawal Limit may apply.
		

Valuation Limit is the lower of the purchase price or valuation at the time of purchase.
			

Withdrawal Limit is the maximum amount of CPF you can use for your home, currently capped at 120% of the Valuation Limit.
			



	 


	dont forget the Age limit ......... everyone will live till 93 . Everyone should celebrate .

			Dunno anyone kenah this.... Last time I went to the area office and told them to use my cpf to pay off the balance of my housing loan ... About $5k only. 
		

			I had more than than in my cpf.... But the staff at the counter told me I have to pay partial with cash instead if I wanted a full redemption! 
		

			So I just told her to forget it and then continue to deduct from my cpf.
		



	I didn’t pay any cash for partial redemption.


	That’s 10 years ago.

	I really can't understand this cpf withdrawal limit or so. My wife's hdb left 7k loan and she got a love letter from cpf saying she cannot use cpf to pay anymore. Ended up we redeem the loan after paying lawyer fee of 700. Tamade. 


	Guess she would be cpf rich when we hit 55. I better love her deeper. Haaa.

	This will encourage developers to bid higher and higher for EC.  Like that how middle income earners buy?


	I thought the govt said EC is for those middle income earners whom income are being sandwiched between low and high income?  Is 16k per month (averagely 8k per person) considered middle income?  Sooner they will increase to 18k then 20k.  Like that scrap EC better.

	HDB is actually very comfortable to live in.  ECs and PCs are over-hyped.


	HDB should review the income cap to buy BTO and simply levy a premium on those who exceeds the cap.

	The direction is correct but you exaggerated all my figures leh. Basically we have been disqualifying and building up demand year after year.


	A colleague and another friend aiming for third property (paid 7% ABSD for second) both still hoping for ABSD to be lowered or removed. 


	Both of them almost have full cash to pay off a whole unit!


	I wonder why they cannot see how many people aiming for second property. How to let so many get third one???

	This move looks to me to prop up resale HDB price. If want to help first timers, should lower BTO price & like you say, those whose income exceed ceiling pay a premium.


	From a balance sheet perspective, this move though will increase asset value and matched by an increase in liability. If you lower selling price, asset values will come down. And will not be politically popular since many own their HDB.


	GDP becomes higher. Good if your KPI includes GDP.


	But for those whose only asset is a HDB, you need a roof over your head and whether it’s value goes up or down, you can’t really profit from it.

	Only these two friends. Not everyone can be as prudent as them.


	No kids (until very late in life) for one. The other one doesn’t even have kids. No cars also - most of us can’t.


	And they have been very astute investors with equity, and started off with HDB.


	But both had to pay ABSD (7%) because they hesitated in transfer of HDB when I told them to do it quickly.


	They used loan even though they have to liquidity to pay off second property. The reason, I don’t need to explain here. They have the liquidity to cheong for third but are waiting to see if ABSD can be removed for some unbelievable reason.


	Last, the third is an investment unit so it can be an undersized unit that they can pay up for. 700K cash is no problem for our sifus here.

			1. ah gong raise the income ceiling is good, proves they listen to public feedback. many already complain cannot afford to bring family go atas restaurant jiak garlic bread, pasta and fish&chip but there are many good food in hawker. they shut the door and do not allow people (above $12K) go there makan
		

			2. now with higher income family come into hawker, it makes hawker food looks affordable
		

			3. subsequently, some hawker will also raise their price with higher affordability now  .... huat ah!
		

			my question:
		

			why set an upper limit since 80% of sporean live in hdb?
		

			setting an upper limit is to punish people to save money and live frugally?
		

			are we in a situation that bto is way under supply? the over-subscription news is always for the "hot area" bto project which is perceived as "lottery" bto
		

			the argument is scare "rich" people buy bto and flip to make profit
		

			that's the wrong policy that treating bto as a commodity to flip like share  .... need to fix this policy and not "eligibility" of true buyers who want to buy and live in hdb
		

			rich people already flipping bto and ec by sponsoring their kids ... so what say you?
		



	You are so right........I have been punished for years.  


	They dont let me buy new HDB near my parents and claim grants 


😪


	But in the end, many people still flipping BTO and taking our very hard earned tax.

	life is also about living. prudent and saving for investment properties at the expense of other parts of living is not life.  i think i mentioned a true case of my MIL neighbor who never owned a car,  only pack lunch to work, hardly ever take taxi. when both the old folks died all the money and property went to the adopted daughter. who then bought out the other next door neighbor and extended the house. never heard of the husband and wife working now.

	I am not advocating anyone’s lifestyle. I prefer to be more balanced as well. But just highlighting what some people are capable of. They are the ones who can still play the game and the reserve financial power even if there is a slight pullback in property prices is tremendous.


	Ultimately, the meaning of life and how to live a balanced one is decided by oneself.
