Wah, Huat ah! If the developer manage to sell this project, it will make the surrounding properties prices look bloody cheap....very very cheap indeed.   Very soon, if u dun have a million $$, do bother to think of staying in bishan or nearby areas liao.

Unbelievable that the fever still on, ppl have a thinking that price will keep goIng up.

When recent cm start, the mkt look dead,

then come along WT which sold fast with high psf.

Rest of the new project release after WT with price close to 1k psf do they worth that price?

Not that WT worth that much but rather demand for mix development is high n it's rare. 

those new release n located far from anything, do they really have the demand?

Or just a false signal? Impulse buying?

Just visited various showroom over the weekend for hobby. A lot of foreigners are at these show room. If you check with the agent on duty, you will be surprise the amt of cash they have ready to plonk down a unit or even a few units at one go. And reason is simple... They have cash and in their own country, buying property is not a sure win bet. At least here, other than SAR and financial crisis, no one has ever lost money buying a unit during launch by developer. This was what I was told

See a spark only, they will call for fire engine. Previously, small fire they also don't want to bring in a fire extinguisher. You see the difference? 
 

American is going to elect a new president. From now on, the incumbent govt of USA will ensure and make ensure the economy is humming and humming. 
 

Singapore private property still have good buys around. Just make sure you know what you are buying or investing. I will shun all shoebox unit. Just cannot imagine who would like to stay in such a unit. Maybe others see the potential but I didn't. But that's ok with me. Is like 情人眼里出西施

cos 894psfppr likely to mean break even cost (after construction) about 1300psf.  after factoring their margin of abotu 300psf, that means they have to sell at 1600 psf.

although bishan is marginally better site, you don't expect it to be worth 38% more expensive than a clementi site.

There's RI and Cat High.. That's enough a draw a guess.
 

also, bishan hasn't had any new property launches in a few years already? So there may be some pent up demand.
 

But I agree its too high a price.

Erm, its about being near to the amenity or facility you want.
 

That's what flats near gd schools, mrt etc command a higher premium.
 

That's the point, not whether its difficult to take bus or mrt to sch.

then parents with girls only 

don't buy near bishan already meh ?
 

indeed it is a concern, 

but definately not a major one 

since sec sch is only 4 yrs

one wouldnt wanna stay near Jurong West extension for his kids's education in NTU also right?
 

however,

like you've mentioned,

bro, travelling for pri and sec sch is different from travelling for tertiary leh.. 
 

some people with boys, may like that place due to proximity to cat high
 

some people with boys and girls, or foreigners may like that place due to proximity to RI and AIS
 

some like being close to J8 and MRT
 

some like the feng shui of the place
 

some like it because they grew up in bishan..
 

and there were little new developments springing up in bishan for the past few years, that's why the pent up demand.
 

so there's many factors, which i brought up the sch factor which i think is likely the most compelling reason why they can take such high price thresholds.

yeah, 

chill.
 

fyi, 

i stayed bishan all my life

but Cat high and RI are as good as they are situated there.

but i don't study there. (not elite enuf)
 

so makes no impact to me.
 

however, 

MRT, circle line, CTE, J8, Golden village benefitted me tremendously.

The 1-2km proximity to school doesn't apply to secondary schools like RI. And CH oredi has a long waiting list from alumni & parent volunteers, so betting on the proximity is a long shot.

Bishan 8 was launched ard 1000-1200psf ard that time if i recall correctly. It was astronomical pricing during the 90s. Obviously those that bought then thot it was a good 'investment'. After 10+ years, the lucky ones juz got their money back (but actualli lost $$ after factoring % and inflation).

This 2 will come head to head, FH vs LH, D14 vs D20, who will be the carro....sssorry...winner?. 
 

UOL Group's mixed-use Katong Regency in Tanjong Katong Road will be pushed out by the end of this month.
 

UOL Group president (property) Liam Wee Sin told The Straits Times that prices of the 244 units at Katong Regency on the former Lion City Hotel site will average $1,500 to $1,600 per sq ft (psf). 
 

More than half of the units at freehold Katong Regency are smaller one-bedders or one-plus-study units starting from 549 sq ft. These will be priced at about $1,800 psf, while larger units will list at about $1,400 psf. This means one-bedders at the project will go for about $1 million upwards, two-bedders at $1.3 million to $1.4 million while three-bedders will be sold at about $1.9 million.
 

'To some extent, the smaller units will target investors and also young couples... The key value proposition of this development is its centrality, connectivity and the growth potential of Paya Lebar hub,' Mr Liam said.
 

UOL's Mr Liam said he does not think further cooling measures are needed despite the strong sales of new homes. While volumes are up, the measures have had their intended effect with prices showing signs of slowing, he added.
 

He expects suburban prices to be stable while high-end home values might dip by 5 per cent to 10 per cent this year.
 

The redevelopment of the mixed-use site UOL acquired in January last year will see Katong Regency built on top of a new mall, One KM. 
 

The mall, which has signed Cold Storage as an anchor tenant, will have up to 200 shops and be positioned as an edutainment centre.

The key is holding power.  You will be surprise by the holding power of Singaporean. Go, talk to housing agent and banker. They will tell you there are still plenty of citizen with very very strong holding power. Many don't need 80% loan from banks. 
 

HDB already selling their flats at more than S$500k, what do you think?



 

holding power is provided you dont tio margin call. how sure are you that all of the local buyers bought without overleveraging the hell out of themselves?
 

you may have forgotten the adage, past performance is not an indication of future performance. 
 

good luck.

just not too long ago back, $1M property is considered expensive already and now almost everywhere three bedroom become $1m. my guess is those who have property to start with can afford to buy after they sell (regardless of whether it is a hdb or private) as they have rode on the wave but to be able to afford another $1m house?

If you've bought a decent unit in before the current, it should be generating ~8-10% in rental returns. 
 

That will give earlier investors the money to pay for second unit.

the same has been said for the past 5 years.  

has anyone every wondered why has Japan's interest rate stayed at zero for decade and still is today. 
 

personally know 2 other friends who invested back then had cashed out with a million dollars cash sitting in their bank. now they're waiting on the sideline for a good buy.  
 
 

but everyone knows, in today's term the days of quick gain are over. thread carefully.

After 10+ years, the lucky ones juz got their money back (but actualli lost $$ after factoring % and inflation).



 
 

Bishan 8 from Far East launched at $750psf and TOP in year 2000

This is quite similar to RiverPlace at Roberson Quay. Both Far East Development didn't appreciate a lot considering today's term

they oredi hv trouble flogging off d'leedon at $1500-1600psf and that's at D10, next to MRT. 
 

but $1700-$1800psf at bishan heartland??..... 



 

Huge overhand at d"Leedon.

Total units 1715, so far sold 466 units, leaving 1249 units without owners.
 

Another project with large unsold units is The Interlace.

Total units 1040. Sold 698 units. 342 unsold units.
 

Right up to 2016, total units to be built 77k. Not counting the HDB.

Don't know how the market is going to absord all these expensive private apartments.

Funny that people who have to take huge loans to buy are rushing to buy while folks who can easily buy with cash are just watching by the sidelines.

different people at different stages in life have different needs..
 

those who rush = need a flat/no flat to call their own...
 

those who didnt rush and have cash on hand = already have a house to stay (I can almost guarantee this is true)...
 
 

does it then make sense to you? haha

Actually Capitaland don't need you to buy. They just need them.


 
 

Govt knew all these hot money will eventually need to find a home and usually these are fixed assets and not just any fixed asset in Timbuktu. These money will flow to SG and drive up inflation. Thankfully Govt made it more "painful" for them to park their money here with 10% ABSD. With Europe joining in the effort to print more money after US already done so. (read Quantitative Easing) value of money is just going to get eroded exponentially over time.

It was launched in 1997 at $1100 psf. Link below

after that it was a series of mishaps. Asian crisis, Dot Com bubble, Sept 11, Iraq War, SARs. Mishaps one after another.

After factoring loan interest (which was as high as 4.5-5% during those years) and inflation, the B8 buyers lost $$ big time even after selling at $1100psf.

Hhhhmmmmmm.....




If u have a single ammo of $300k cash + Cpf combined.. U can only use that to pay 20% downpayment for 1.1mil.. So u will be scared if prices reach above 1.2 mil, cannot buy Liao. And the fact is not much options to buy in private property market for budget around 1 mil in todays context.. Actually still have good buy, but most singaporean pretty lazy to go around viewing.. Buy 1mil+ investment go view 20-30 diff property like will kill them.. Whereas buy fridge, buy car got to view many different models..
 

That explains why..

Looking at the age of this architect, after he pass on, Sky Habitat will be even more priceless. (read Mona Lisa painting) and there are and will have only 2 sky habitats in this entire world 
 

You may not own Habitat 67 in Canada but you can now live the dream in Bishan

If HDB new flats are bursting S$500K and resale bursting S$900K, what do you think for a private decent 2 room @S$700K? I think is cheap...
 

My friend just bought a new Bt Panjang HDB flat near to the DTL2 depot (Is depot hor, not station) also S$400K plus. 
 

6.5M people looking for housing couple with stable political environment, I think the future is bright for property
 

Financial crisis like 1997 and 2008?? I don't think it will happen again. Previously, even when there is fire, govt also don't bother to bring out the fire extingusiher. Now, a spark only, everybody calls for a fire engine. And if own fire engine not enough, still will call foreign fire engine. Everyone too scare of the repeat of 1997 and 2008.

Super prime land at less than 1200 psf when new condos at fort road going for more than 2000 psf. Quickly grab before prices shoot up. Heard new mrt station just outside bay east will add to its value.

the developer overbidded for the site at 894 psfppr......so no choice gotta sell that expensive.
 

cos 894psfppr likely to mean break even cost (after construction) about 1300psf.  after factoring their margin of abotu 300psf, that means they have to sell at 1600 psf.




the developer who overbid for the land has to recover their investment, buyers are the ones who will "help" the developers, no one else will....   the former will go all out to convinece the latter prices will rise so that the latter will "help" in ther re-coup....

there is a site at clementi very near the central also that was sold at 554 psfppr.
 

although bishan is marginally better site, you don't expect it to be worth 38% more expensive than a clementi site.
 

clearly the developer overbidded.  it will be really interesting to see if they can sell at 1700 psf when FH sites at telok blangah (facing sentosa) are sellign 2000psf




even if it takes the developer to offer his backside to convince buyers to put their money there, he will do just that.... else he will 'die' as a result of overbid...

UOL Group's mixed-use Katong Regency in Tanjong Katong Road will be pushed out by the end of this month.
 

UOL Group president (property) Liam Wee Sin told The Straits Times that prices of the 244 units at Katong Regency on the former Lion City Hotel site will average $1,500 to $1,600 per sq ft (psf). 
 

More than half of the units at freehold Katong Regency are smaller one-bedders or one-plus-study units starting from 549 sq ft. These will be priced at about $1,800 psf, while larger units will list at about $1,400 psf. This means one-bedders at the project will go for about $1 million upwards, two-bedders at $1.3 million to $1.4 million while three-bedders will be sold at about $1.9 million.
 

'To some extent, the smaller units will target investors and also young couples... The key value proposition of this development is its centrality, connectivity and the growth potential of Paya Lebar hub,' Mr Liam said.
 

UOL's Mr Liam said he does not think further cooling measures are needed despite the strong sales of new homes. While volumes are up, the measures have had their intended effect with prices showing signs of slowing, he added.
 

He expects suburban prices to be stable while high-end home values might dip by 5 per cent to 10 per cent this year.
 

The redevelopment of the mixed-use site UOL acquired in January last year will see Katong Regency built on top of a new mall, One KM. 
 

The mall, which has signed Cold Storage as an anchor tenant, will have up to 200 shops and be positioned as an edutainment centre.



 

I feel the cooling methods are pushing our property price. The more cooling methods from gov, the higher property price.

I think at the end of the day it is only his name that is valuable.  He will give the concept, then after that his kakia take over.  He will only show face when there is media coverage.  And in Singapore, the submissions will still need to go through a local architect.  This local architect will handle all the "dirty" work such as coordination, submissions, kena scolding by clients, kena chase by contractors, etc.

It will take a really rich buyer to dare to plonk down $1.5mill for a unit.

If got no strong backing, who dare to buy?

Some may die....especially those DINKS who never worry about job loss or sickness.

but hor, some of the blames have truth in them..... its supply-demand situation: if gahmen control the supply (land sales etc), prices are likely to go up artificially    i not buyer (at least not at this moment anyway), and whatever gahmen/developers do, if too ex for me, like you said, dont buy also can....

this is more appropriate:
 

very likely to lose a lot of money when they sell, especially since this is 99 yrs leasehold
 

there are condos in town which are much better value for money today
 

Capitaland will have to depend on foreign investors who hopefully do not know much about the local property market
 

Locals will be very unlikely to buy

Same thing why so many complain about high COE now.
 

It's easy to urge others to work hard to earn enough to afford a nice house or car.

But practically, it's not that simple as working hard or smart to get higher pay.
 

I am happy with my HDB. Even if the PSF dropped to $1000psf, I will still have problem buying a private at such cheap price. Therefore I can really only dream and complain about such expensive goods.

Your calculation is completely off. Typically HDB owner hardly pay any property tax so......

Using your example,  First $6000 of AV is 0% and the remaining at $36K at 4% which is $1440 only.
 
 
 
 

e.g. If the property can fetch a rent of $10,000 per month, Annual Value is

$10,000 X 12 = $120,000 
 
 

For Owner Occupied Tax rate:
 
 

http://www.iras.gov.sg/irasHome/page04.aspx?id=2378
 
 
 

Example 2: AV of your house is $24,000
 

Property Tax payable is:	

First $6,000 X 0% 	= $    0

Next $18,000 X 4% 	= $720

Tax payable:	= $720 
 
 

Example 3: AV of your house is $84,000
 

Property Tax payable is:	

First $6,000 X 0% 	= $    0

Next $59,000 X 4% 	= $2,360

Remaining $19,000 X 6% 	= $1,140

Tax payable:	= $3,500

property tax is calculated using annual value x tax rate

annual value is the estimated annual rent of your property if it were to be rented out. the basis of determining the annual value is the same whether the property is rented out, owner-occupied or left vacant.

assuming you can rent out at $7K per month (bigger units) = $84K per annum, the property tax would be $3,500
 

Property Tax payable is: 

First $6,000 X 0%  = $    0 

Next $59,000 X 4%  = $2,360 

Remaining $19,000 X 6%  = $1,140 

Tax payable: = $3,500

Yes it might as everything is possible. but with inflation set to rise and future more millionaire, closer to city os a better deal. just like when COE shot up, premium cars get more sales
 

Question is if you can afford a $1800 psf quantum why buy a in BISHAN for $1800psf? go home still must always share the Jam in the famous CTE, MRT so what?? look at the frequrnt MRT breakdown minster also say inadvertable cause high useage!?!?! what nonsense??? EX CEO SAW use to say MRT under usage!!!!
 

$1800psf can get you so many condo in city or outside city within 2km radius.
 

BTW always go URA as all this are real transacted price.
 

Caribbean At Keppel Bay average $1,400psf to $1,600psf Resort Lifestyle Living

my point is many Singaporean are Super mis price!!! NEVER do HOMEWORK just hearsay!!!!!
 

there are many property in the market you can buy with $1,800psf if you willing to pay. still location location location, $$$ can make or earn time lost in jam cannot, make you tired too.
 

no matter how good skyhabitat is, it is still in BISHAN HDB. Sorry to say sad but hard truth just like how good Lexus is, pple still say it is a Toyota cannot match other premium brand. If buy District 9 is like buying a ferrari or near city zone like a mercedes..

Spot on! I was asked if I wanted to market it, but I had no confidence in this.
 

For people I know who would pay for units at the indicative PSF, they wouldn't buy Bishan. For those that would afford the unit prices, they would not pay for something at this PSF. What would I be left with? Less informed people who I will have to chop carrot to get them to buy, so I said no thanks...

If u have a single ammo of $300k cash + Cpf combined.. U can only use that to pay 20% downpayment for 1.1mil.. So u will be scared if prices reach above 1.2 mil, cannot buy Liao. And the fact is not much options to buy in private property market for budget around 1 mil in todays context.. Actually still have good buy, but most singaporean pretty lazy to go around viewing.. Buy 1mil+ investment go view 20-30 diff property like will kill them.. Whereas buy fridge, buy car got to view many different models..
 

That explains why..

People don't argue so much.

Those who can afford it please buy. It's a Master piece architecture not found anywhere else in the world (apart from Montreal)
 

Some who cannot afford it will certainly sour grape and continuously pour cold water. 20 years later, they will still be in their cheap HDB commenting how expensive condos/landed is or shouting market crash. That is life for them.
 
 

In 1990, Bishan Park Condo is only $33 psf. That's based on land sale data. If Bishan Park Condo owners were to listen to the rest telling them not to buy, they will still today be in their HDB. Fortunately they don't have Internet in those days to listen to all the distraction and sour grape affecting their purchase decision.
 
 

In 2032, $1700-1900 psf will be considered dirt cheap.

one the other hand Skyhabitat is by Capitaland releted to Temersk advertise $1,800-$1,700psf than behind the sence offer buyers huge discount, rebate or furniture vouchers.....but created the false impression at $1800psf for bishan if "sales are good" not known yet.
 





 

clearly you are confused between public housing and private housing..its up to the private developers to set the selling price..if potential buyers think its expensive..they can reject to purchase

master piece hmm.....
 

Daniel Libeskind also a famous Architectural
 

For $1,800psf to go for architectural one can buy Reflections at Keppel Bay, buy the Address and resort lifestyle.
 

Skyhabitat famous architrctual buy u HDB town address and HDB lifestyle.
 

new nick just to post here, are you one of the scuker who bought??




He School kid posing as prop guru?! 
 

Some branded architects use clients' projects to either experiment, re-cycle previous design ideas, etc. 
 

Some of their ideas are neither outstanding nor practical. Putting a common swimming pool on the roof is costly and other than bragging rights (while the novelty is still fresh locally at the expense of high construction cost which jacks up developer's selling price) offers very little tangible benefits to the buyers who are paying for such high cost construction.

there isn't any huge discount nor furniture voucher at Sky Habitat. 3% Stamp Duty discount only.

if you had gone to the show flat today you'll know they've sold 1 whole stack of 3 bedder.

Correct me if I'm wrong.  Nowadays developers give furniture vouchers and all kinds of disc to articially create the impression that high psf are holding, but the psf reported are before disc and furniture vouchers?

I am not confuse about HDB and private, just thinking if Capitaland is government, shouldn't they have some kinda social responsibilty?? maybe not so much for FarEast or CDL, UOL etc..... as they are private company.
 

maybe I am more confuse abt our government thought they should have "control"... You are right in term of developers pricing their properties it is a free market

I thank these new skyhabitat owner and happy for myself, cause they help to push up CCR home price by making this sub-urban project a success.
 

dun know whether all these new skyhabitat owners know there is currently "fire sales" at reflection at keppel bay. 200++ units on sales there. go arrange a viewing and you can see how many transponders (their keys) one agent is carrying!!!!! I have seen many agents carry a whole bunch each like security guard, and agent themselves telling me 200+ units on sales, thus make me wonder is this part of the reason 2 weeks ago there was 30min show on Reflection for 4 different days!!
 

earlier I recommand reflection cause to me if wanna pay $1800psf you could buy a famous archi. a better address and lifestyle compare to skyhabitat yet there is fire sales there currently.
 
 

to the new owners, "may the odds be ever in your favour"

Fire sale? Try offering $1000 psf and see if they will sell it. 

In case you didn't notice. Those units had curtains and lighting install. Owners are trying to sell  or otherwise rent out.
 

If you sincerely believe it's on fire sale, then the agent pulled a fast one on you. In fact there are many advertisement in property guru advertising fire sale. Go take your pick and see if you can any cheap buy

"fire sales" as 200+ units going on sales currently.
 

nobody mention $1000psf didnt I mention earlier on 2 different posting (I mention if wanna pay $1,800psf reflection is a better choice due to address and lifestyle) never did I mention $1000psf
 

please read my posting clearly. further more, reflection can be bought as low as $1,600psf of course lower floor and lousy facing.

BTW Speculator, you seem to apply a new nick just to defend skyhabitat.
 

well, my posting so far and purpose is, I think a certain group of buyers are mis-price or mis-inform on market. of course I can be wrong as all my posting are my opinion.
 

just find if one is willing to pay $1800psf there are many choices in Singapore even in city area. if you stay in city before, likelyhood you won't want to move out or too far from city cause it is a joy everything is so near and the buzz is different. end of the day is still location location location 
 

look at all global cities apartment/condo all Core Central Region price hold the best. eg. HK will be central, mid-lvl and the peak. London also in city same for NYC, Sydney, Paris, Shanghai, BeiJing, Toyko
 

again just my 2 cents worth.
 

if you happen to be one of the skyhabitat owner, again

i  disagree

why
 

those who have made millions from en bloc or previous sale of property
 

if they really like this place and is their place of residence
 

and not as a rental investment
 

why there is no real lost
 

after all they are going to stay in there for the next 10 - 20 years
 

so what
 

like the fools of HDB thinking wow value goes up

so what

as long as it is the only property they got 

where is the real gain only paper gain



 
 

I don't wish to debate with you on this matter.
 

I invest for a living, be it stock or property. I comment based on appreciation potential analysis. I don't care if they buy for own stay or rent.
 

I was the first anywhere to comment about contraction in property resale prices in Q4 2011.  I made this comment in July 2011. That was when every so called "property agent & directosr" were saying prices will just continue to climb. Just search for my thread in MCF. I was proved correct 6 months before the contraction took place.
 

Those who buy this development will be one of those last herds who got suck in just at the top of every peak cycle.  
 

And you know what? I shouldn't be debating this with you because I should be happy if everyone buys this development.

I'm not an expert in property investment but base on analysis of the financial outlook, I have to agree with this outcome; The permutation for this to happen is very high. Maybe not so evident for up to 3rd quarter this year but it will be by 4th quarter of this year onwards.

yup ... no matter how good is the project ... no developer will release all phase in one go

and it's a FACT that subsequent phase is ALWAYS more expensive than initial phase ... even pick up no good ... price it more expensive then give furniture vouchers ... at the end still the same-old price with initial phase

I never believe these "sold" numbers especially if the launch is just 1-2 working days ago.
 

I know some developments report their units "sold" when someone send in a cheque. But sending in a cheque does not always qualify as 'sold"
 

Some people send in cheque to "try" for a better price. These may be rejected eventually.
 

Some people send in the right asking price, but bank may reject loan.
 

Some people send in the right asking price, but later realised there is the ABSD thing or can't get 80% loan because holding other properties. Ended up can't go through.
 

There are many possibilities that "sold" may not be actually "sold" especially if they are reported during the first week.

secondly, i have friend who is unemployed but family got money.

so this guy sales executive doesnt mean he got no backing to buy.
 

age and profession doesnt tell the full picture.  

Often, the surname paints a clearer picture.

I think you are mentally not ready to buy, I met alot of buyers like you before bro



 

Not true, if I go and view or contact the agent, means I am ready to buy, if not I don't like to waste their time, but hor, some agents I call but don't even bother to pick up the phone or call me back, too bad la, maybe their comm. alot no need my business.

Yes, progressive payment, but I doubt anyone in their right mind will buy if they don't have the 40% assuming they can only take 60% loan, as for the family got money part, then totally different story leow, my fren earns 6K a month and bought a 3.5million semi d....what to do, we can only choose our lifes not our parents.

I find it very weird. It is mentioned that the buyer bought already then see showflat. Will you do that for a unit that cost $2M each? Buy already then see.
 

If he want to buy for rental, why dun he buy something completed and got rental immediately as compared to buying this with his money stuck for many years with no return until the property is completed?
 

Is he talking sense?

Let me try to explain the phenomenon of Buy First Then See
 

it is a feeling thing lah.. Very hard to explain. I bought my first HDB resale also like that..... View the first house; walk in walk out.; some how just buay song; Then view the second house, walking towards the house from the lift already standby the cheque book. Sign the cheque on the spot even thought the owner add S$5k.... Sold off after 5 years without lost despite poor market conditions
 

Buy my first private condo.... drive pass the showflat a few times on my way to meetings. Some how, a voice telling me I must buy a house here. Sold off after 3 years, profit more than 20%
 

Bought my current home... Again same feeling when I bought my HDB. The current valuation already more than 60% of my buying price...

at 32, how do bank assess risk to grant loan assuming $1,500,000 and 2 units somemore

like you said, maybe got backing for 70% downpayment for both units? even that 30% loan is $450K ...

and at 32, salary must be at least $150k per year huh to be able to take that quantum of loan?

depending on surname and collateral elsewhere, loan is highly possible. not base on income.

If loan is 60%, you got to have the next 20% ready after S&p completion, it may be call down within 6 to 12 months.

Absolutely, with you there.

when the gap between the mass mkt and the prime becomes tight, it only makes sense for investors to buy prime.

psf may appear high but overall quantum is not as close proportion wise. prime area still relatively immune to mickey mouse effect.
 

so the subway sandwich class (and their obsession with all things new) bo pian lan lan have to accept the prices the developers are dishing out.

if you buy expensive car and maintain it for 5 years eg Ferrari (new not 2nd or 3rd hand) easily 1.5mil

eat well and dress well everyday for 1 year can come up to $500K
 

the rest you work it out

When Centro Residences in AMK was launched, the response was "very good", one of the agent told me 80% was sold during initial launch. But look, the showflat still around until today. FEO still trying hard to sell the remaining units.



 
 

above 70% FEO is already sitting on profit. 
 

they've already sold 280 out of 329 units. FEO is a good developer and that's one of the reason people buy FEO. They don't fire sale. Keep and sell it 10 years later and make even more profit.
 

You're naive to think they're trying hard to sell. I doubt they're even putting any effort. Just let the show room stay on. Agent spent their time there. They only need to pay for the air-con and if it sells good. if it doesn't so be it.

well to be honest...the design is quite spectacular but whether it's worth that much....to each his own......if I were to choose, I would rather go for D'Leedon, interlace or reflections....well thats just me.....

Out of 509 units.........they are releasing by phase!!!
 

70% of 180 units = 126 units sold............not sure if they can SELL well that is why they release phase by phase
 

Detractors will say they want to increase prices for later phrases
 

WELL, if the development is GREAT, then the developer will release ALL units and the development SOLD OUT in 1 DAY!!!
 

May the force be with YOU BUYERS!!!!!!   



 
 

No developer for such a big project will release ALL units for sale.......that being said...if you cant get access to the units NOT released for sale, it just means get back to your day job...   just kidding...

release in phases to drum up demand...also which sounds better? 80% sold for phase 1 or 20% sold?

That why many of my earlier posting I keep on stressing $1,800 can buy better location project. then some mention famous archi. leh, so I say $1,800psf can buy Reflection also famous archi, with better address and lifestyle cause "fire sales" as 200+ units selling now, yet sales are slow.
 

kena reply ask me go offer $1,000psf cause "fire sales".... 
 

if resales yet 200+ selling at the sametime dun you guys think there might be price war between owners?? thus translated to "firesales"? or bargin hunting?

We visited the launch of CapitaLand's latest project the Sky Habitat. As of

Sunday afternoon, approximately 150 units out of 509 unit project were

sold. While turnout at the show flat was robust, sales progress was moderate.

We attribute the muted take-up to the project's premium pricing, and

larger unit sizes. Pricing ranged from S$1.25m for a mid-level 710sqft 1

bedroom flat (c. S$1,700psf) to S$2.85m for an average 1,798sqft fourbedroom

unit (S$1,537psf), inclusive of a 3% early bird discount. For reference,

the 1Q12 average selling price of units at Thomson Grand have been

c. S$1,310psf and units at Centro Residences have transacted at approximately

S$1,521psf.

Located in Bishan, Sky Habitat is conveniently located next to the Junction8

shopping center, the Bishan Circle Line MRT station, and several international

schools. Buyers were a mix of Singaporean, Indonesian and Chinese

origin, with 2 and 3 bedroom units being the most popular. Special financing

rates were also available from OCBC at SIBOR + 0.7% for the first two

years, or 0.98% for the first year based on a 3.52% discount to their reference

rate of 4.5%.

Overall, pricing was slightly above our forecasts and we estimate a modest

1ct accretion to NAV and c. 18% margins based on an estimated break even

of S$1,317psf. We remain neutral on CapitaLand as execution risk rises

given the immaturity of its development pipeline following a record S$11bn

in acquisitions last year. In our opinion, valuations are fair at a 26% discount

to our RNAV of S$3.97, maintain Hold.

Third straight day of MRT disruptions 

8 stations on the Circle Line affected this morning. -AsiaOne 

Adrian Tay and Natalie Lim
 

Wed, Apr 18, 2012

AsiaOne 
 

MRT service disruptions this morning between Holland Village and Caldecott stations on the Circle Line have extended to One-North station.
 

This according to updates on SMRT's website. As at 9.15am, train service going both ways between one-North and Bishan Stations is down.
 

In total eight stations are affected.
 

Apparently, this morning's delay is due to a track fault.
 

Earlier in the morning, initial announcements only stated that there were no MRT services on the Circle Line between Holland Village and Caldecott stations.
 

AsiaOne reader, Mr A Lim, said an announcement was made at Boon Lay station at around 8.50am, saying that the Circle Line was back up. But when he got out at Buona Vista interchange at 9.09am, ground staff there told him there was no service at the moment and advised him to find other means to his destination.
 

According another AsiaOne reader, announcements made at Yio Chu Kang MRT station said that Circle Line train services have resumed. However, when he reached Braddell MRT station, announcements there still said that there are no train services between the two stations.
 

Free bus bridging services are being offered at designated bus boarding points outside one-North to Bishan Circle Line stations.
 

A commuter on her way to one-north told AsiaOne that a shuttle service took almost 20 minutes to arrive.
 

She said the shuttle was crowded and people were uncomfortable. She said: "The bus driver was asking us to move in, then a commuter shouted: 'Sorry, no space!' before commenting in a slightly softer tone 'You think we're sardines?'"
 

This is the third day that rush-hour commuters are facing delays.
 

On Tuesday morning, a train at Jurong East Station stalled, causing a 20 to 40 minutes delay.
 

These delays follow those on the North-South and East-West lines on Monday, as well as the East-West line last Friday.
 

Passengers who could not continue with their journey because of the disruption, or had to exit an SMRT train station without taking a trip but had their fares deducted, can get a refund at the Passenger Service Centre in any of SMRT's 83 stations in the next 14 days.
 

What our webknowledgist on the ground observed
 

Most passengers coming from the North-East line at Serangoon station only found out about the train disruption at the Circle Line platform. There was a sign placed next to the fare gates indicating that the train service from Caldecott to Holland Village was disrupted due to track fault.
 

The downward escalators were stopped and not running. Upon seeing the crowds, some passengers decided to walk back up and leave the train station.
 

Train services heading from Serangoon station towards Harbourfront experienced delays at each station. The train stopped for a short while before leaving for the next. Announcements were made to notify passengers of the slight delay.
 

At Bishan station's Circle Line platform, at about 8.47am, an announcement was made to inform passengers that the train service has resumed. However, at Braddell Station, announcements about the train disruption were still being made at 8.50am.
 

There was a larger than normal crowd gathered at the platform heading towards Dhoby Ghaut at each station. At Bishan Station, there were about 10 people waiting at the second level balcony looking down on the crowd.
 

A few passengers were taking photos, while others were tweeting, Facebooking and texting their friends.

above 70% FEO is already sitting on profit. 
 

they've already sold 280 out of 329 units. FEO is a good developer and that's one of the reason people buy FEO. They don't fire sale. Keep and sell it 10 years later and make even more profit.
 

You're naive to think they're trying hard to sell. I doubt they're even putting any effort. Just let the show room stay on. Agent spent their time there. They only need to pay for the air-con and if it sells good. if it doesn't so be it.



 

Are u a FEO agent? I almost fall off my chair when i read your statement. A good try.

That why many of my earlier posting I keep on stressing $1,800 can buy better location project. then some mention famous archi. leh, so I say $1,800psf can buy Reflection also famous archi, with better address and lifestyle cause "fire sales" as 200+ units selling now, yet sales are slow.
 

kena reply ask me go offer $1,000psf cause "fire sales".... 
 

if resales yet 200+ selling at the sametime dun you guys think there might be price war between owners?? thus translated to "firesales"? or bargin hunting?



 
 

There will always be "contrarian" with vested interest who do not talk sense. I support you as I have been to Reflection and it is only 10% occupied. Try driving there at night and you will know. TOP 4 months already and still very quiet.....

Maybe they have, and they think paying 1500 or even 1800 psf is still a good buy. Who knows it may rise to 2000 psf or more in future.

I wonder who are these 'tenants' that are willing to rent these far away heartland condos? 
 

angmoh usually dun like crowded places like bus interchange, malls n hawker ctr. wherever pubs or cold storage is located is a good indication of where the angmohs camp. 
 

japs tend to stick together in river valley or west coast.
 

koreans likewise in bt timah.
 

so maybe left wif indian nat, prc or pinoy....

FEO developments very cheena in design.

Not much intrinsic purchase value IMHO, for investment or own-stay.

Personally, I would avoid theirs!
 

Compare that against say, SC Global's niche developments ... from The Ladyhill to Sculptura Ardmore, often times with SCDA's architectural prowess ...

now these are much more savvy, many notches up in terms of design flair, visual sensuality and most importantly quality and location.
 

Did I say location? Yes, location.
 

Definitely a night vs day comparison with NTF & sons' mediocre, repertoire of cookie cutter developments.
 

Now, I am no agent (unlike you, maybe), nor affiliated to any developer - but I have been in SG's property investment scene for long enough - even built my own house, to not appreciate the designs churned out by FEO. Nothing personal.

I am with you on this one.

Many years ago, when FEO first launched their Greenwood strata-title houses, it left a disgusting aftertaste in me. 

The designs were pretty morbid to me, architecturally - and somehow a 60's Chinese song ran through the recesses of my mind, just staring at the neo-classical and greco-roman front facades of the newly built houses.

Sorry NTF, no hard feelings huh!
 

Even for fixtures, I think German brands like bulthaup, Gaggenau, Duravit, Hansa and Miele are out of their vocab.

Generally mass market brand names used.

True. CCR is deemed the value buy now. Whatever tough measures there are, CCR is always the most resilient. The gap has narrowed recently due to the overpricing of certain parts of OCR. When the rest of the mkt fully realises this, i reckon CCR prices will fly to regain the natural gap.

to buy or not depends on one's financial position. all i'm saying is if one is going into the mkt now, forget the increasingly overpriced & outlying OCRs and go for CCR as it seems like better value. plus, prime locations are always more resilient.

so maybe left wif indian nat, prc or pinoy....



 

Japs also like to stick together in Novena/Newton area. Most of my Jap colleagues and their community stays there also.
 

Koreans are now spreading from bt timah to upper bt timah.

I think it will be an uphill task for the following reasons (my 2c worth):
 

1. general economy outlook is still grey

2. too many prime units are still unsold

3. transaction volume too low to move prices significantly (esp for units that are >2,000 psf)

4. If anything, it will be the correction of the mass market eventually. Due to screwed up HDB policies implementation, the govt has unwittingly created a bubble in the mass market sector (u can also blame the low interest rates, liquidity etc, but question is how come it did not create a similar asset value spike in the luxury mkt?)

Actually, there are a couple of 1300 psf FH 2 bedder private apartments (not condo) within <300m from Novena square. They suddenly look very cheap compared to those LH99 condos in the non-prime HDB heartlands.
 

Actually, it really makes no sense as these 2 bedder FH apartments are priced at the same as a 5 room HDB flat in toa payoh/bishan

Actually, there are a couple of 1300 psf FH 2 bedder private apartments (not condo) within <300m from Novena square. They suddenly look very cheap compared to those LH99 condos in the non-prime HDB heartlands.
 

Actually, it really makes no sense as these 2 bedder FH apartments are priced at the same as a 5 room HDB flat in toa payoh/bishan  



 

golden question is why the buyers of watertown or sky habitat did not buy these FH apartments. Because of facilities?

True. CCR is deemed the value buy now. Whatever tough measures there are, CCR is always the most resilient. The gap has narrowed recently due to the overpricing of certain parts of OCR. When the rest of the mkt fully realises this, i reckon CCR prices will fly to regain the natural gap.



 

Or OCR will fly downwards to regain the natural gap  
 

Personally, i feel OCR prices are quite risky becos:
 

1) Price of a condo is usually directly proportion to their rental yield @ +/- 4%

2) Where is the demand of tenants coming from? 

3) How many foreigners who have a budget to pay 4-5K rental for a 2 bed-room condo is willing go into non-prime HDB heartlands?

4) With a budget of 4-5K, one can easily get a very beautifully renovated and relatively new <10 years old condo for rental in prime areas!

5) Can the Singapore economy continue to sustain such high rental as rental rates is also influenced directly by pay packages & company allowances.

6) With the massive anti-foreigners sentiments in Singapore, can the import of foreigners keep pace with the release of new units?
 
 

So... good luck to investors who buys LH99 condos at current prices. Unless its for staying purposes, its very high risk to do any investments in LH99 non-prime areas at the moment.

I think it will be an uphill task for the following reasons (my 2c worth):
 

1. general economy outlook is still grey

2. too many prime units are still unsold

3. transaction volume too low to move prices significantly (esp for units that are >2,000 psf)

4. If anything, it will be the correction of the mass market eventually. Due to screwed up HDB policies implementation, the govt has unwittingly created a bubble in the mass market sector (u can also blame the low interest rates, liquidity etc, but question is how come it did not create a similar asset value spike in the luxury mkt?)



 

Yes, thats what I predicted as well.
 

My guess for main reason why there is such a huge spike in mass market/non-prime LH99 condo prices could be due to that the buyers are mainly the middle class Singaporeans who aspire to live in condos. So naturally, there is a huge huge pool of buyers compared to CCR.

can;t really blame developers as they are profit driven entities. Will do anything that makes most money
 

U shld blame URA and MND. Too weak to oppose developers + too myopic to consider the big picture + other undisclosed motivations




Just thinking, looking at the feedback:
 

Buyers buying more than 1 unit.

Buyers buying without even viewing anything or going down, just submit chq.

Most units sold recently are <1000 sq ft or rather around the region of 500 sq ft.
 

The local speculative fever seems to be burning hotter than ever.
 

I think it's better than they don't come up with any more cooling measures bec they seem to make a bad situation even worse.

Such property spike is largely developer supply driven.

If anything, i tink the measures will be aimed at hdb upgraders since the frenzy is happening in OCR. CCR is still an international mkt and s'pore cannot be seen to be overdoing othrwise it'll scare away investors (not juz in property but financial services, wealth management).
 

There's now an unfair imbalance in the mkt. Pte prop owners muz sell their pte b4 buying hdb. But hdb owner can keep their hdb and still buy pte. WTF? Nothing against the genuine hdb upgrader. But if realli 'upgrading' to pte, why need to keep the hdb flat? That'll wipe out the shoeboxes in OCR instantly.

Agree with you on the inconsistent application. If genuinely upgrading, shd let go HDB flat rather than squat on 1 public and 1 private.

All the mickey mouse units in heartlands, good luck!

Those buyers seem to miss considering, quality of build, livability, type of tenant and resale.
 

I think they get duped by agents into a bullish frenzy and also becos they go no money to buy bigger units so they buy a $500k unit, still can claim got private property/condo....

can haolian.. so just buy loh....
 

basically a function of liquidity in the market.
 

If I am developer I'll do the same.

develop mickey mouse and let it roll.....

let the small timers lap it up.

and at higher psf at that.  why not?

 [laugh]  It really sounds like an NDP song. Loophole or not, I think the FD returns (if you can still call them returns) are just forcing everyone, including the old foggies to migrate their funds to property.

$1,700-1,800 psf for an OCR, non-prime, outskirts, 99LH, HDB-upgrader-type of condo development could have only been bought by non-savvy, green-behind-the-ears, sua-ku buyers - probably buying a private property for the first time in their lives!
 

For that kinda money, there are many prime, FH developments in the secondary market to be had.
 

But thanks to them, valuation precedence would already have been set, that will further prop up D9/10 prime property prices!

Current owners of such higher class developments can only thank the stoopid buyers of Sky Habitat, for strengthening their asset investments even further!

With the marina east area ear marked for another IR or major theme park, international cruise terminal , the bay gardens, in a few years ,pedestrian bridges linking the condos there esp costa rhu, pebble bay makes it a few minutes walk to the nicoll marina square, suntec city,mrt stations, sports hubs, water taxis, etc.. future mrt station near to bay east gardens.

No brainer to buy one or two there and watch their values rise  in value in a few years time.

A lot of people simply "monkey see monkey do". 

'Hear say' FEO is lousy and assume it has to be right. 
 

I think generally these group are your typically HDB owner who hasn't really been into PC yet. So basing their assumption using what they heard others said?
 

Using Watertown as an example you will see their layout is very efficient

When it comes to pricing. FEO is never cheap. 

If you are buyer you would want a developer that can hold prices and not do fire sale just to clear stock. In fact selling point of FEO is, they rather hold and rent it then to sell it cheaply. 
 

However if one can't afford it, then one's perception of FEO coud be they are very expensive, unfortunately.

SH finishing is disappointed.



 

Agree but Capitaland has never sell on finishing. 

If you want good luxury finishing in same vicinity, go and see Thomson Grand.
 
 

Capitaland sells on location and architectural. d'Leedon, The Interlace all having similar finishing

Sculptura will break $5000 psf on average.



 
 

Yes but Sculptura Ardmore is not your typical mass market or luxury product. It's ultra high end.

Buyers there are not the typical man on the street. I doubt they even know what is MyCarForum
 

No. 8 Ardmore Park is not an address that mass market people visit or buy. In no way comparable to Sky Habitat or any normal luxury condo

Other than location n layout, finishing is another key factor.

selling at this high price with this kind of finishing  just a turn off.

A lot of people simply "monkey see monkey do". 

'Hear say' FEO is lousy and assume it has to be right. 
 

I think generally these group are your typically HDB owner who hasn't really been into PC yet. So basing their assumption using what they heard others said?
 

Using Watertown as an example you will see their layout is very efficient

I think my impression goes beyond the perception of material quality. I always wonder why their commercial developments evoke such a deep sense of nostalgia, as if they were stuck in time. Indeed, they were and they are still. I think it is very telling. 
 

Any developer who is able to scrounge and sit on tracts of land for many years definitely will be able to rake in the bucks. Not many developers have the privilege to do so.

This developer is resourceful enough to acquire lots of Freehold land and resell them as leasehold. In fact some of their recent projects are sold as Leasehold with FEO themselves holding onto the Master Freehold title. Effectively taken over the role of SLA (in a way)

Singapore law actually allows this.  
 
 

When everybody here in this forum is all dead and long gone, FEO will still be raking in money for their many future generations to come...

never mind that their development is nostalgia.

In my opinion the most undervalued area is tanjong rhu.condos at this  Super prime narrow strip of land going for less than 1200 psf. With the marina east area ear marked for another IR or major theme park, international cruise terminal , the bay gardens, in a few years ,pedestrian bridges linking the condos there esp costa rhu, pebble bay makes it a few minutes walk to the nicoll marina square, suntec city,mrt stations, sports hubs, water taxis, etc.. future mrt station near to bay east gardens.

No brainer to buy one or two there and watch their values rise  in value in a few years time.



 
 

I cannot agree more, 15 years back, it was one of the preferred condo to own / investment, well, for those who hold makes paper asset, for those who sells, make double or more . . . most are 99 yrs except one

precisely. the tg rhu story is 15 years old. and who cares abt world-class stuff like MBS, gardens by the bay, international cruise terminal, marina bay downtown, etc, etc? 
 

neighbourhood bus interchange, hawker ctr, mrt (when it works...) is the biggest, bestest thing now. how else do u explain WT and SH?

funnily, last week's ST reportedly interviewed a few buyers of SH who all claims to buy it to rent out.  who in the right frame of mind would buy something with a rental yield of below 3%?  i would have still find it more likely if the buyers wanted to buy a place for own stay near their parents and friends in bishan.

SINGAPORE: Property giant UOL Group has put out its first mixed-use development for sale in 2012.
 

Some 70 per cent of residential units in Katong Regency were booked on its launch. Of these, the sale of about 130 units have been confirmed.
 

Buying momentum of new private homes seems unabated as seen at the latest property launch of Katong Regency, with buyers out in full force despite it being a weekday afternoon.
 

The developer of the Katong Regency said enquiries on the development had flowed in even before the launch.
 

Kam Tin Seah, Senior General Manager (Investment & Strategic Development) at UOL, said: "We initially planned to maybe have more than one phase at launch. But because of the good take-up at the soft launch, we have made the decision to launch the whole project.
 

"It is a very well associated kind of Tanjong Katong address. So you would expect the core demand to still come from this immediate neighbourhood."
 

Located at the junction of Tanjong Katong Road, the site used to house the former Lion City Hotel and Hollywood Theatre. It is a mixed development which consist of 244 residential units and commercial space.
 

Prices for the residential units range between S$950,000 for a 550 square feet one bedroom unit, and S$2.52 million for a three bedroom pent house unit of 1,970 square feet. That works out to about S$1,475 to S$1,727 per square foot.



Analysts said the pricing is at the steep end, compared to units at nearby developments, which are about five to 10 per cent cheaper. 
 

Still, buyers response are expected to be healthy. Analysts said this is because the government is planning to rejuvenate the area.
 

Lee Sze Teck, Senior Research Manager at DWG, said: "There is a certain growth being ramped into the area by the government, so people might buy into the growth story in the area. Also this is a freehold project, and it is a mixed development with retail shops and residential units."
 

The apartments will sit above the upcoming ONE KM mall. To be managed by UOL, the retail development will have a total net lettable area of 210,000 square feet with some 150 retail tenants. Some of the buyers have said that they like the retail mall as there is a lack of malls in the Katong area.

besides the usual instruments, if one is more attracted to property, there are other properties that can be gotten for 4+% rental yield.

thought they will just pay according to the use of the land. So if they acquire for road widening, then it is paid based on market value of road?
 

I'm not too sure anyway, since i too poor to own any land so will never affect me.

frankly, i tink the gahmen oso  abt the current state of the property mkt. it has used up almost all it's ammo liao. 
 

speculators weeded out by abolishment of DPS.
 

big chunk of foreign buying weeded out by ABSD.
 

regular buyers weeded out by the 40% d/p.
 

short term flippers weeded out by the 16% SSD.
 

despite the high hurdle rates, majority of buyers are s'poreans.
 

i tink the last bullet left is to level out the playing field between pte property owners and hdb owners (since pte property owners cannot buy hdb, it shld be likewise for hdb owners i.e.1 hdb, 1 property policy) 
 

the US low interest rates and asia high inflation environment, gahmen can't realli control. 
 

short of killing the mkt and plunging voters into negative equity (which would be a political disaster), maybe it's time for KBW to do a LTY and taichi that the economy is realli good and demand is genuine?

Reply to the bank interest rate: Sing Dollar also expected to appreciate against other currencies so no point seeking higher yields in alternative currences. Can seek higher yields in bonds and equities or reits but lacks leveraging effect and no brick and mortar so some people find it less appealing.

May not be true, I was told that when FEO buy FH land, the reason why it was resold for leasehold is bec they reapply to URA to increase plot ratio, n only way for ura to approve is for land owner to agree to give up FH status.. its matter of maximizingbusiness return

yep agree.  singaproe doesn't like to adjust interest rates but i think this is probably more effective in controling property spiralling prices.  a lot of buyers are lull into false sense of complacency thinking the low interest rate is here to stay and low instalments now means they can afford it.
 

i do agree also the policy to allow HDB owners to buy condo but not vice versa is flawed.  but i see they may still reluctant to level the playing field given that the hdb housing is their tool to convince voters that hdb flats has value and they are more interested in controling spiraling hdb prices than spiraling condo prices.

not logical for ura to do that la. why would they need to maximise return for FEO? 
 

more likely scenario is that the site contains both FH and LH land and since gahmen will not allow LH to be turned in to FH, the onli way is to regularise both as LH. after 99yrs, the orig LH part can still go back to gahmen.

If anyone wants to buy a property for rental and willing to take a yield below 3%, then I think this guy is crazy.
 

he might as well leave his money in cpf and collect 2.5%. Totally risk free.
 

Unless he use full cash to buy the property and never touch his cpf money at all, then I nothing to say.
 

But even then, there are plenty of avenues to earn more than 3% with cash.

First of all, property prices will not go up so fast due to cheap financing, which is part of the CPI, however, cars different story, hence inflation in singapore is caused by different govt polices, but yes generally higher interest rates is used to control inflation

I see. Recently we see that the value of OCR for some insane reason have been edging upwards. Good for CCR owners for this help to prop up value. However, do you think that CCR have already hit true valuation or are they still under true valuation?

Okay don't kill me if I am wrong, I think govt does a valuation every few years and if the SLA kicks in they will just the last done one, plus ex gratia payment to match the current market value, but of course this is flawed and assumes property prices always gradually goes up.



 

i'm quite sure they don;t do that. A new valuation is done by the chief valuer or appointed private valuer for each acquisition.

i'm quite sure they don;t do that. A new valuation is done by the chief valuer or appointed private valuer for each acquisition.



 

My apologizes, I just google and what you said is true, damn it, I studied conveyance law in 2003 and never keep up with updates.
 

Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act 2007
 
 

The Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act 2007 (the 'Act') has come into force on 7 May 2007. The Act was passed on 11 April 2007.
 

This Act amends the Land Acquisition Act to abolish the use of a statutory date in determining the basic compensation for land that is compulsorily acquired on or after 12 February 2007 and to provide that the basic compensation will instead be the market value of the land as at the date of its acquisition.
 

However, the market value of the acquired land cannot exceed the price which a bona fide purchaser might reasonably be willing to pay for the land. The market value of the land is to be arrived having regard (but not only) to the zoning and density requirements and any other restrictions imposed by or under the Planning Act at the date of acquisition, and any restrictive covenants in the title of the acquired land. However, no account is to be taken of any potential value of the land for any other use more intensive than what is permissible by or under the Planning Act as at the date of its acquisition.
 

The Land Acquisition Act is also amended so that when accessing the market value of acquired land, it will no longer be prohibited to take into account any increase in value arising from any improvement to the land within two years before the date the land is declared to be required for a public purpose, or from development in the neighbourhood by the provision of roads, drains, electricity, water, gas or sewerage or social, education or recreational facilities within seven years preceding that date.
 

The special compensation provisions for acquired land which is used as a burial ground and acquired land that is devastated or affected, directly or indirectly, by fire, explosion, thunderbolt, earthquake, storm, tempest, flood or any act of God, have also been abolished. Such land, if acquired, will be assessed no differently from other acquired land.
 

The compensation for land acquired before 12 February 2007 continues to be governed by the existing law.
 

The Act also makes improvements and establishes new procedures for the compulsory acquisition of land to simplify the acquisition process

is it time to slay the sacred policy?



 

I don't see why not, an extra tool for the govt to control the economy, but I am no economist and cannot comment on its effectiveness.

Abit stupid to leverage for a less than 3% yield la, but many high net worth individuals actually doing it now to buy bonds.




Cant compare bonds/ FD and property investmen as if they are the same. The risks are very different.

I see. Recently we see that the value of OCR for some insane reason have been edging upwards. Good for CCR owners for this help to prop up value. However, do you think that CCR have already hit true valuation or are they still under true valuation?



 
 

I tink CCR is at fair valuation. There are some pockets which are obviously not cheap but there are oso many pickings below WT, SH, KR prices at better locations. 
 

Put simply, would u buy Polo Ralph Lauren or a Polo Swiss (or Santa Barbara Polo club....so many similar sounding clones until blur liao) shirt if they both cost $100 each?

home loans can be had as low as sibor+0.7% = abt 1.1%. coupled wif a high inflation rate of 4-5%, the bank is basically subsidising u. this is a historical moment in time and like it or not, it does make sense to stay invested.




the hunger for yield is satisfied yes. But the capital? If home prices move down just 5%, isnt it LPPL?
 

There is really a decent size supply looming bec during the 2008 downturn, a lot of physical completions were delayed to avoid a glut. 5 yr later, the chickens are coming back to roost. 
 

As it is vacancy rate creeping up. 
 

Buy for self stay still can make a case for diving in now. But for yield and ignoring the possibility of a downturn? Don't even talk abt capital appreciation.

A 5% correction is always a possibility. But then, many ppl are so cashed up now that they can afford to hold. That's why it's important to buy into CCR locations where the riche dump their $$ and can take a long term position instead of places where novice 'investors' buying their 1st pte property camp out and are sensitive to cashflow issues.

I was looking at UE Square, the one bedders there 506sq feet about 1 million, another alternative is projects in cbd like lumiere and the clift about 1.1million....between RV and Tanjong Pagar, don't know which is better....but although in relative value much better, I still think prices are on the high side.

UE area no action or new story to tell lah. I tink CBD area is a better bet as the new downtown is the next story as financial services is here to stay. Prices look high becoz u still looking at OCR as a comparison which is a diff mkt altogether. As a guide, juz look at Shenton House which is recently put enbloc and is asking $1700ppr. By the time it hits the mkt, i tink easily $2800-3000psf liao.

Thanks for the advice, now the question is buy now or wait...dilemma dilemma.....now very comfortable no housing loan to worry about, buy leow have to worry about job security....somehow the impending over supply does not seem to lead to lower prices as of yet....so I conclude prices driven by sentiment, low interest rate and general economic conditions which is still fairly good in Singapore, for prices to go down will need a recession and retrenchments.

If in cannot decide then invest in something smaller lar, at least can sleep well at night.
 

many products out there which can beat the returns of real estate.
 

my fren started his own hedge fund, claim that historical track record was ~50% pa even during 2008-2009. But I'm too poor, dun have at least 425k to invest.

You need to tick 3 boxes for perfect storm mah. 
 

Enough supply to cause vacancy rate to go up. Ticked.

Recession. Not ticked

Retrenchment. Not ticked
 

Now 1 box is ticked liao, wait for the other 2 lor. Sentiment mah. Can flip flop faster than physical supply.
 

You need house to stay or not? If not property is not the only avenue to grow your money.

That's true but retail investors like us do not have access to the more exotic instruments, hence real estate is the perrenial favourite amongst singaporeans, as for hedge funds, don't you need to be an AI to invest? The only hedge fund open to non AI, the MAN Trend fund also in the red, so doesn't mean hedge fund then sure make money...many hedge funds went bust due to over leverage and lopsided bets.

I don't get hedge funds. The traditional long only mandate also cannot kau um tim liao. Now give mandate to short...
 

I mean, if they suck at longs, giving them the mandate to short is just letting them burn the candles at both ends.
 

Yes, some are good but that's rare and it's not consistent.

Sure or not, even if I have 425K I also wun dare to invest in something not regulated by MAS like hedge funds as the fund manager have absolute discretion over what they can do, never had a week of loss over last 5 years then I think he is legend leow and everyone would have heard of his name, I don't believe la, even seasoned traders know it's normal to lose 30 to 60% of the times....sound dodgy to me...and even some arbitrage funds like croci alpha pairs also cui....

the founder started investing with own money and with some 3rd party capital. Did well enough that they decide to start their own fund.
 

Target was only $10m so might be closed by now (told me abt it mid last year).
 

anyway, as i've said, i'm not a quant guy so can't do my own due D on their strategy so can;t comment if it's realistic or not.

frankly, i tink the gahmen oso  abt the current state of the property mkt. it has used up almost all it's ammo liao. 
 

speculators weeded out by abolishment of DPS.
 

big chunk of foreign buying weeded out by ABSD.
 

regular buyers weeded out by the 40% d/p.
 

short term flippers weeded out by the 16% SSD.
 

despite the high hurdle rates, majority of buyers are s'poreans.
 

i tink the last bullet left is to level out the playing field between pte property owners and hdb owners (since pte property owners cannot buy hdb, it shld be likewise for hdb owners i.e.1 hdb, 1 property policy) 
 

the US low interest rates and asia high inflation environment, gahmen can't realli control. 
 

short of killing the mkt and plunging voters into negative equity (which would be a political disaster), maybe it's time for KBW to do a LTY and taichi that the economy is realli good and demand is genuine?



 

This is the reason for this bull run. Probably the long term effects of QE1, QE2 and now LTRO

The inflation factor does play a big part. Everyone knows when prices of things go up, they hardly or never come down. I dun recall my teh-si or prata price ever coming down even after gahmen say inflation under control. 

When the gahmen failed to control inflation and liquidity, it artificially tries to suppress prices by introducing all these measures. All it did was weed out the marginal players and leave the path clear for those that are financially stronger (hence, the higher prices found at SH). Abit like the current COE situation, B&B cars out but MB, BMW still powering ahead.

Good times are back! Even higher than before ABSD!
 

[sINGAPORE] After going into deep freeze since the additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) was introduced on Dec 8, resale transactions of completed private homes snapped back to life in March. The recovery was partly disguised amid the first quarter figures, weighed down by dismal volumes in January and February.
 

In fact, Savills Singapore's analysis shows that resale volumes for March have recovered to levels seen before the ABSD kicked in. The turnaround was sudden, as the resale market had remained jittery even while buyers were returning to property launches in the first two months of the year. However, since March, agents say that some of the eye-popping per square foot (psf) prices achieved at new launches have helped to jumpstart interest in the secondary market for completed properties, where prices look more attractive.
 

Savills' analysis of URA Realis caveats data shows 1,142 resale deals for private homes (excluding ECs and en bloc sales) done in March - double the 565 caveats for February and more than three times January's volume of 314 transactions. The March number also exceeds December's volume of 776 and November's 981.
 

"Given that the average monthly resale volume for 2011 was 1,166 transactions, the March numbers show that resale volumes have recovered back to pre-ABSD levels," said Savills Singapore research head Alan Cheong.
 

The March 2012 resale volume is still 23 per cent below the 1,480 caveats lodged in March 2011. The final tally for March 2012 could rise as more caveats stream in over the next few weeks. Savills' analysis, based on caveats captured by URA Realis as at April 24, also showed 332 resale transactions being done so far this month.
 

Savills commented: "The pace of resales in April is still healthy. Agents are still conducting frequent viewings and enquiries. Barring any new property cooling measures or external shocks, resales should remain robust for the next few months - given the current low interest rate environment, liquidity and increasing population scenario, among other factors."
 

The weak performance in the first two months dragged down the volume of resale deals of private homes for Q1 this year to 2,021, a decline of nearly 25 per cent from 2,688 in the preceding quarter and a year-on-year drop of 42.3 per cent from 3,503 units in Q1 2011.

"When the ABSD was imposed on Dec 8, 2011, new home sales practically froze in the following weeks. Subsequent to the successful launch of Watertown and Parc Rosewood in January, resale buyers took a while to fully absorb the fact that the property market still has legs. Only in March did they put pen to paper," said Mr Cheong.
 

Agents report that high prices achieved for 99-year leasehold suburban launches like Watertown in Punggol (with median prices of about $1,340 psf in February and March) and Sky Habitat in Bishan, which marked a new record for the suburban condo market based on an average price said to be about $1,650 psf after taking into account the initial 3 per cent discount given to all buyers - have helped to stir interest in the resale market and in projects launched earlier that are still being marketed by developers.
 

Archipelago, a five-storey, 99-year condo facing Bedok Reservoir Park, is going at about $1,000 psf on average. Compared to Sky Habitat, resale prices for some completed freehold properties in the prime districts would appear attractive to some buyers, say agents. For example, a 990 sq ft ground floor unit at One Jervois changed hands for $1,515 psf (reflecting an absolute price of $1.5 million) in March, while a 947 sq ft unit on the third floor of Jervois Regency sold for $1,361 psf (about $1.29 million) in April. A 12th floor unit of 2,250 sq ft at Residences@ Evelyn changed hands at $1,609 psf in March, while a 2,508-sq ft fourth floor unit at Chelsea Gardens at Walshe Road sold for $3.8 million, which works out to $1,515 psf. David Neubronner, director of residential project sales, Jones Lang LaSalle, said: "Completed freehold properties at Meyer Road and in Districts 10 and 11 priced at $1,500-1,600 psf represent good values for owner occupiers."
 

Although psf prices are higher for new launches, absolute price quantums are generally bigger for older completed projects as units are mostly larger.

"Buyers of resale properties may be a different group than those buying in the primary market; they could be better heeled," suggests an agent.

Credo Real Estate executive director (residential) Manjit Gill says the company has seen an increase in enquiries and requests for viewings of completed properties in the resale market, particularly those in the vicinity of new launches.
 

"While psf prices are lower in the resale market, buyers would have to make full payment of the purchase price upon completion of sale (usually in three months) whereas if they buy a unit from a developer in a newly launched project, progress payments can stretch over the three years or more that it takes to complete the project," he adds. Lower psf prices in the resale market may also be due to the age of the project and its facilities.

Someone was complaining long ago that bishan was sitting on cemetery ground, how true that their ancestor/s blessed them with good tidings and wealth.
 

Many old estates in Sp are also sitting on such sites like Holland , LCK, Siglap and Braddel, Thomson etc.
 

The tide will die down, if U see many ppl go and buy pty, it is the wrong tome to buy, I had learnt from my expert.

May not be true, I was told that when FEO buy FH land, the reason why it was resold for leasehold is bec they reapply to URA to increase plot ratio, n only way for ura to approve is for land owner to agree to give up FH status.. its matter of maximizingbusiness return



 
 

If you said wad is true, I stand to believe tt many FEO proj were bought fm FH land, they even top-up 5-6 yrs for construction period ( The Shore now sitting on old ' Rose Garden ' ) opp Katong Shopping Ctre, if my memory serves me right.
 

Well, certainly, this is thinking out of the box by FEO management, they have a bunch of ppl who can do things differently, They reckoned that land was a scarcity here and Sp is becoming more savvy in terms of buying for self-stay & investment, L99 is still better than 50 yrs leasehold in China/ HK.
 

Maximizing biz return is part and parcel of changing demographics  . . . and it will go on and on till URA/SLA changes it's policies to stop the rot.

Many old estates in Sp are also sitting on such sites like Holland , LCK, Siglap and Braddel, Thomson etc.
 

The tide will die down, if U see many ppl go and buy pty, it is the wrong tome to buy, I had learnt from my expert.
 

Invest wisely and do ur homework




From end 2005 (except 2008), property sales have been increasing. Almost 7 years and no signs of abating....

Really cannot understand bishan at 1700psf

Go do a search at ura.. Recently the sail transacted at 1700 to 2000 psf.. No need to guess which one is better investment value at these prices



 

Got to see the floor area first, can't just compare psf like that

Bishan 8 was launched ard 1000-1200psf ard that time if i recall correctly. It was astronomical pricing during the 90s. Obviously those that bought then thot it was a good 'investment'. After 10+ years, the lucky ones juz got their money back (but actualli lost $$ after factoring % and inflation).




Back then,was loan rate somewhere 4 to 5%? We are making the banks very rich

Qe1 n 2 and ltro is for foreign countries, how did it make it here? Dun see foreign funds buying now, but mainly singaporeans with too much money to spare




You are right if you are talking about the old boys who are near 55. They may be their last purchase on earth. Seriously, many are hdb upgraders, believe it or not, you'll see many units hanging their clothes at their windows. Foreigners did come in to speculate, but is much lesser now, now leaving sky high prices for the locals. Well, singapore will be the next japan,, or dubai if you seriously think about it.

Carribean at Keppel got NO transactipon over $1,700psf last 6 months   thus which is a better bet?
 

Riverplace now mostly all below $1,300 psf, guess many dunno a downtown line 3 MRT (beside Merchant road and Clemenceau Ave) "Fort Canning station" is currently understruction around 100m away from this condo completion 2016 there about. 
 

Very goog rental yield and easy rent out to Expat for this project, after 5 years seller stamp duty just nice Fort Canning MRT is up and running.

Like I said, you can't just look at PSF. Those 2 developments you mentioned have very high quantum prices.
 

See your budget is how much.

sky habitat selling $1500psf to $1700psf thus the quantum to pay for such development is the same (same affordibility or cheaper for many development). People pay $2m for sky habitat 3 bedroom, that can help you buy Carribean at keppel!!! 
 

quantum???
 

Riverplace 1 bedroom can get as cheap as $1mm!! not small at 786sqf!
 

2 bedroom around $1.3mm to $1.4mm there abt at $1,000+ sqf. Quantum big??
 

go see URA caveat... that why I mention few weeks ago in this thread many Singaporean are mis-inform and mis-price abt singapore property.

that's why i say CCR is considered better value. 

many of these so-called 'investors' are prob not that well-informed of the pickings to be had in prime locations simply thinking that it's expensive and keep their eyes and ears within the comfort zone at the heartlands where they live.

i been shopping around for resale condos.  noticed that bank valuations went up recently after sky habitat launch.
 

i am half suspecting the banks also revise valuations upwards across the board since SH can sell so high psf.  not exactly to the same level as SH but seems like valuation went up about 3-5%

i suspect their margin is quite similar to any mass market margin (i.e. 10% - 15%)
 

Most of the price goes towards land. In addition, they have to spend more than usual on architect fee & A&P. So can;t really afford to provide marble etc.
 

Just like the Sail. It was launched as mid-market product but it was the speculators who pushed the prices up to 'luxury' segment. Many ppl were quite disappointed at the quality of the sail given that they paid 2,500 to 3,000 psf. But they forgot that it was launched at 900psf
 

Buyers have to go in knowing what they pay for.

Are you saying that SH is launched as a mid-market product ?!?!
 

aniway.. even all the other developer e.g. FEO , UOL give better furnishing so as to justify their higher selling price.. I think capitaland really very lousy.

haha i like your diagnosis.
 

when i look at the photos of SH, i was thinking it looks nice on the outside but scores low on practicality.  in short hokkien phrase of 好看不好吃
 

first and foremost, it looks like except for top floor unit, the rest would all collect the litter of the higher floor units 
 

secondly, as you rightly put it, it seems to facilitate jumping from one floor to the next lower floor. 
 

so sorry to tell the world renowned architect i don't think highly of his architectural design

No, i said the Sail was a mid-mkt pdt.
 

And since u brought it up, yes, i think SH is also mid mkt. (lower end). Different ppl have different definition. For me, mass mkt is anything below 1,300psf. Mid is below $2,000 psf. Highend is 2,000 to 3,000 psf. And luxury is above 3,000psf
 

Some other developers can give 'better' furnishing because they have better margins to play with. Eg, Seahill land was bought at 400+ psf and selling price is 1,300psf. So definitely can offer better materials vis-a-vis SH.
 

For SH, buyers are paying for the location + premier iconic design. Not for interior finishings.

hahaha ... Let the first batch of suckers buy with inferior furnishing first.. then during re-launch, upgrade the finishing for the 2nd grp of suckers..then 3rd grp of suckers.. throw in fridge/washers... ha haha

land cost + renowned architect cost + material cost + building cost ... how much already?
 

http://news.xin.msn.com/en/singapore/story...umentid=6081544


CapitaLand's designer condominium project Sky Habitat will go on sale on April 14, amid expectations that prices will hit new highs for projects in suburban areas.  

The 509-unit Sky Habitat is located in Bishan Street 15. 
 

The developer had paid S$550 million for the site through a government land sales tender in February last year - a price tag described by some property analysts as hefty. 
 

Some market watchers estimate that a unit could go for between $1,700 and $1,800 per square foot. 
 

This could potentially smash the price ceiling for suburban projects. 
 

CapitaLand was tight-lipped about prices, saying they'll be available closer to the launch date. 
 

Sky Habitat is designed by renowned architect Moshe Safdie - a premium that's likely to be pegged to its pricing. 
 

CEO of CapitaLand Residential Singapore, Wong Heang Fine, believes the strong sales seen in the first quarter will continue. 
 

"We always believed that the residential market is a function of many factors, key one being global sentiments - how the economy will grow as well as the local environment. Interest rate is still very low and the job market is still very good. Naturally, one would expect there would be a positive response from home buyers."

I think that is a fair statement to make. 
 

Did you go to their showrooms to see the finishings? It is a fact that the land price for this development is extremely high and the finishing given is hardly top grade or anything close to that. 
 

I think my conclusion is justified as it is common sense that the developer has to cut down its building costs after bidding so high for the land and hiring an expensive architect/design.

I too like most ppl here expressed disbelief that what was being marketed as a world class design condo having what we perceived as cheap furnishings like homogenous tiles....utter disbelief.....how can something that cost so much be using tiles that cost so little...the money spent is not worth it....and the land next to it is reserved meaning something might be buitl there in future...maybe another high rise...
 

i feel that the design is too cramped and too much space was allocated to the balconies...even 1+1 bedder has a sizeable balcony...that balcony maybe worth ard $50k ....

actually i wouldn't blame the developer on this count.  they know that this project has to be marketed on the emotional platform.  for buyers that are swayed by emotions, will they likely notice the difference whether the flooring is homogenous tiles, marble or granite?  just a way to maximise profits knowing the weaknesses of the likely buyer.

Wonder how the noise from the MRT will be like at SH. My house just across the road from where SH is and can hear the MRT already. Quite irritating. SH is even nearer the MRT.



 

wah, too far also complain too near also complain

Lol. That is my observation la. Maybe the higher floors won't be that bad. But then its really near the MRT if you are lazy to walk. Its like just beside the entrance to the Circle line Bishan interchange.

Near MRT is a plus point. One will get used to the noise.  But if I can afford a unit there, I also can afford a car and I rather drive.

funny thing
 

i thought when you buy hdb flat 

once fully paid

do you own it or are you just a tenant
 

because HDB refers owners as tenant or lessee
 

true or false

hdb is 99 years leasehold (fully or not fully paid) ... technically lessee is correct

many also argue none of use own the car in spore because the coe for car is 10 years means can only drive 10 years and all ends at 10 years mark

Good if renting out the units. Can use it as a selling point to get higher rent.

The longevity of the thread illustrates perfectly Singaporeans fasination with property. 
 

Anyway instead of starting another thread, I would like to ask if I buy a Resale HDB flat and take bank loan, do I need to satisfy the MOP of 5 years even though it is a resale, and can I rent out one room and stay part time in another room?

Their bathroom n kitchen fitted with white solid surface top... Cheapskates man..
 

Anyway most of the units have balcony/terraces.. Their size are around 300+sqft.. Which is around 300x$1700= $510,000 not 50k bro..



 

Wah seh, the balcony cost so much. Maybe bcos it is closer to the sky.

But I buy resale and not at subsidized rates, don't see why I should satisfy the mop, but anyway nevermind, let's not argue about hdb rules.
 

I really intend to stay there not just lock one room, so it's legal for me to rent out the other rooms as long as I stay there although maybe not all the time? I prefer to stay on the right side of the law....

Never, that's why I had not stayed in a hdb for the past 20 years of my life, well they would argue that even though it is a re-sale flat and COV, hdb is for staying and not for investment.
