Hmm... pity, empathy or disgust?
 

 
 		164,000 Singaporean adults living in private housing have no declared income	        			     

SINGAPORE: About 164,000 Singaporeans live in private properties and do not declare income for the purpose of personal income tax here, said Second Minister of Finance Indranee Rajah on Wednesday (May 8). 
This group, making up about 6 per cent of 2.7 million adult citizens, either do not have any yearly income or have non-taxable income, such as those from interests or dividends. 
 
Some may have taxable income, but are not required to file tax returns after taking into account tax deductions and reliefs. 
This group also includes citizens who have access to other financial means, said Ms Indranee. These can be retirees with private savings and those who are receiving financial support from economically active family members.
The Government, however, does not have further details of the financial situation of these citizens as it only collects information required for tax administration, she added.
Ms Indranee was replying to a question from Mountbatten SMC MP Lim Biow Chuan who asked for the number of citizens living in private housing but do not have any declared income. 
 
In his supplementary questions, Mr Lim asked if more could be done to assess the financial status of these private property dwellers, especially those without income and may be "genuinely poor".
Those living in private property currently do not qualify for several Budgetary provisions, such as GST Vouchers, and other initiatives like Government-sponsored digital TV starter kits.
Citing feedback from his constituency, Mr Lim said some residents have noted that this is “inequitable” and they feel “disadvantaged” due to their type of residence.
In response to that, Ms Indranee said some social schemes are structured with specific groups in mind. The GST Vouchers, for instance, are aimed at helping the lower-income group. 
She added that there are schemes that apply to those living in private properties. Special packages, such as the Merdeka Generation Package and the Pioneer Generation Package, are also in place to “give recognition” to all Singaporeans. 
“The group that Mr Lim is talking about … some of them may have financial resources like savings or non-taxable income by way of dividends or their children may be looking after them,” she said. 
“The challenge then is how do you identify who has no income at all and need assistance.”
Ms Indranee urged those in need of help to apply for assistance, as "the system does allow for appeals and considerations for particular circumstances". 
“The assurance we can give is that those genuinely in need will not be left without assistance," she said.

No pity no disgust
 
If one is asset rich with no cash, then to be fair to everyone else, he should sell his assets accordingly to support himself
 
Dont expect to keep these assets and request the state to support him.
Now that would be seriously unfair.

People damn thick skinned lor... sitting on millions worth of house/land. Say 'disadvantaged'. 
Sell house to fund your lifestyle lei. 
Ultimately still got choice. 
 
People got no choice, no way out, we gotta help. 
Sit on big landed property you still want help?
No income sell the house. Simple. 
 
Most of them want to leave it to children. Then ask children to pay for your expenses. 
They dun want, then sell, simple solution.
What gives them a God given right to stay private/landed property, while most of our population stay in HDB ??
 
Think about it, next guy buy, gotta tear down, renovate, pay stamp duty, (buy marble  ) etc creates jobs and good for state coffers. 
 
Conversely when we help these people, we are essentially paying them to stay in big landed property. 
It just means at some point, some kind of tax is going up, cos extra money has to come from some where. Fair meh??

Disadvantaged?
 
I tell you what is disadvantage.
Not being allowed to buy a new HDB despite being a citizen and contributing whole life and doing national service is then, disadvantage, man.
 
KNN
 
Stay private, dont want to sell, want nation to fund your expenses, and want to cry disadvantaged ?
Lan chiao!
 
Govt should set up task force to help these people sell their assets and put inside CPF and buy annuity plan if they dont know how to manage and are in dire straits.  
 
Those who want keep their asset and yet cry for help.  Pwui!

CEO earning millions per annum needs to buy HDB.
 
Huge private property needs state assistance.
 
Both similar category.
 
Actually can easily go for equity term loan (up to 50% of valuation) or to sell. Sure to have some money back in pocket.
 
The number is likely to be very small. But Govt needs to take a stance that they can’t help 164k people on this matter.

I believe some of these folks expressed they will get adjustment issues if they had to move out in their old age, like the Dakota flat residents..
But here, they will get more money and the ability to get help, such as a domestic helper. 
I saw older people in Teachers Estate protesting against PAP for asking them to sell their landed and even my mum was asking why.. they would have made at least 500% profit if they were the original residents..
More than enough to get a nice condo, maid and live well

living in HDB does not equate to being poor. Its more of a balance of liabilities.
 
While I subscribe to the notion of living within one means, I dont think its fare for Hospital means testing.
 
As long as you are a citizen, if you are hospitalise, you should not be force to take B or A ward. After all, its not like you have an intend to fall sick?
 
So while you may have quite substantial amount of money living frugally and earning a larger than large income, your savings are wipe out because once you go into B or A class ward, your immediately do not have the same subsidies for the next visit and medication unlike the C class patient.

Agree with you on the hospitalization means testing issue , my mom also cannot use C ward , has to use B2 ward to economize on the bills becos of means testing , she don’t like AC and like go kaypoh TCSS talk to other patients in open wards , she is frugal and saved and had property from dad and bloody hell pays tax too, this Gen of people just don’t want to spend and live simply....... but I don’t think they force you to use A class

is there a reason why your Mom cannot use C class? did she opt for B2 when she first went in?
 
i understand that one can opt for C class regardless of type of property provided one has never opted for B or A before.

Cant remember why she cant as she used to use it about 4-5 years back , I remember they said the subsidy thing and since this compulsory medishield insurance thing came in I just put her in B2, which is fine for her , but the bill cannot still claim insurance end of the day as the stay for short period and there is a deductible, most important is that she wants to check out fast and go back home ASAP as she recovers fast and all tests are negative, its just for that 1 or 2 days she is in bad shape ...... ahhhhh geriatrics!! ..... its a cat n mouse game

To be fair, the article didn't even state other exceptional circumstances, such as those who are genuinely poor, living in landed property belonging to someone else, and having little or no assets to their name.
 
The article seems to have succeeded in making most people take a negative stance against this group, by assuming that they are living in private property that belongs to them.

Its not against THIS group per se of course, but against the group pointed out earlier where they have valuable hard assets beyond many others but yet stretch out for help.

Possible, depends on what the owners wants.
 
Option 1 : They can sell the landed property, get a lump sum and downgrade to condo or HDB.
Option 2 : They can also rent out the whole place and rent a smaller condo or HDB to stay. Or,
Option 3 : They can also rent out bedrooms and still concurrently stay in the same premises if they want to maintain the luxury of space for Taji in the morning....

But people who live in landed property may not necessarily by short of cash. They just wanna take advantage of whatever subsidy the govt can give. But the govt also wise. If not,  people will take advantage.

Its an old article.
But this is what they are talking about. 
This group of people are
1) getting larger, due to our aging populations
2) relatively educated 
3) they had stable relatively higher paying jobs back in the 60s, probably as teachers or civil servants
 
The truth is, back in my parents days, these people were the atas crowd, cos the poor moved from farms to HDB.  
These people have the means to pay for their house(kia geh chu/ang mo chu)
Many of you would know what the term denotes, not just a house, but a upper class kind of thing vs 'cheng hu chu'
 
They are now retired, but living in landed. Sorry 0 sympathies from me.
Many times its all about face for these people.  
Don't use my (our) taxes to pay for these people who have 'adjustment problems'. 
Paiseh. Please sell.

In my studies, you will find a variety of people who did not do well.
 
Those who have really fallen down on their luck, business went bad, etc. 
But these guys are waiting to raise again, and have a never say die attitude. I have a friend who has so many ups and downs, it's amazing. Second marriage, back to church, stable life. Kudos.
 
Then there are the ones who just can't get going. Is sugar bad for people with diabetes? These chaps know but still consume it. Then they get worse, have a limb or two cut off and it all spirals down. So ignorance, ostrich head in the sand? Many reasons
 
Then there are those who we call "Anhedonic" 
https://www.medicinenet.com/g00/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=17900&i10c.ua=1&i10c.encReferrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8%3d&i10c.dv=6
 
People who just can't get going. And they may not be ill, physically or mentally. No urge to help themselves and always asking for handouts. 
 
Somewhere in between are the down and out, the old and the infirmed. 
 
And then there are the retired civil servants, pensioners, or those with an inheritance, sitting on nice homes, paid up but now they are jobless, and do not have a lot of disposable income. 
Also unwilling to sell, and looking for the government to help. They attend rallies by the opposition, cry foul when the government tells them to help themselves, but secretly have figured out that no one else can help them, but themselves, and yet they are unwilling to act..

The article seems to have succeeded in making most people take a negative stance against this group, by assuming that they are living in private property that belongs to them.This is a response to a simple question. In the past, people gripe that staying in private housing doesn't mean they are well off. So, the question is, how big is this group? 
Not all of them are poor. But this exposes a blind spot. The Gahment does not know if they are rich or poor.

Let's not turn the discussion into hate against anyone who lives in private property. Some in this forum like to automatically label all successful or rich people as bad and evil people.
 
The article is about how an MP Lim is trying to ascertain whether there is any truth to the claims by activists (who are probably living in private property) that "many, a large number" of such citizens are in "poverty" and cannot pay daily living costs, bills etc.
 
I think its more a case of the MP trying to expose these complainers who make unsubstantiated, anecdotal observations, and expose them as trying to take advantage of welfare.

Eh? Got hate meh?
 
Whats important is to make sure that these people who sit on assets know how to unlock the value to survive instead of asking for welfare in monetary forms.

So what's all the fuss about no income and live in private property?
 
Honestly I don't mind doing it and see nothing wrong other people doing it.
 
The people not happy jealous huh?
 
If you want you can just do it also what. No law says you cannot.

A couple of my neighbours here are retirees, some are ex lawyers , ex businessmen, ex CFO etc. Some drive new premium brands while some drive COE cars, but all of them live comfortably, most of them have been here for a long time meaning they have likely paid up their landed fully. If in a worst case any minority who really could not meet their financial(I personally believe it is unlikely), they could just sell their few million dollars worth of landed and move into a condo or a HDB. This is their personal choice, the government should not worry about this small group of people.

So this may explain why the Govt emphasises rule changes in housing.
 
The worst situation is for them to be left with a less than then 30, now 20 year lease house, and retrenched etc. Sell also no pricing.
 
The current window created is also for this group to quickly proceed with their sales if required.

In my studies, you will find a variety of people who did not do well.
 
Those who have really fallen down on their luck, business went bad, etc. 
But these guys are waiting to raise again, and have a never say die attitude. I have a friend who has so many ups and downs, it's amazing. Second marriage, back to church, stable life. Kudos.
 
Then there are the ones who just can't get going. Is sugar bad for people with diabetes? These chaps know but still consume it. Then they get worse, have a limb or two cut off and it all spirals down. So ignorance, ostrich head in the sand? Many reasons
 
Then there are those who we call "Anhedonic" 
https://www.medicinenet.com/g00/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=17900&i10c.ua=1&i10c.encReferrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8%3d&i10c.dv=6
 
People who just can't get going. And they may not be ill, physically or mentally. No urge to help themselves and always asking for handouts. 
 
Somewhere in between are the down and out, the old and the infirmed. 
 
And then there are the retired civil servants, pensioners, or those with an inheritance, sitting on nice homes, paid up but now they are jobless, and do not have a lot of disposable income. 
Also unwilling to sell, and looking for the government to help. They attend rallies by the opposition, cry foul when the government tells them to help themselves, but secretly have figured out that no one else can help them, but themselves, and yet they are unwilling to act..

 
I once was asking some of the staff why they never go for their annual check up since its fully borne by the company.
 
The response was , better not know than know.
 
WTF ????
 
If you know you can get help no ???
 
Some of them are so obese that they have hips and joint problems. Poster girls for Liposuction ads, yet they choose to continue what they do.
 
They attribute it to something they "perceived" as lifestyle choice. Hate to say this, that's not quite the meaning of lifestyle choice.
 
Than, theres the conspiracy theory. If they find something wrong with me, it gives HR a chance to fire me.

Any property can be sold, but what it fetches in price... ah that's the issue..
And some of these retirees want more and still want handouts from the government..
 
Now we aren't talking about the down and out sorts who need help. We should and must go all out to help those folks. 
 
So not everyone is the same..

The govt is not going out of their way to worry. It is a vocal minority among this small group who are acting like victims and looking to blame the govt for what they see as a lifestyle downgrade. They see it as loss of face.
 
And you may say it is easy for one to sell a multi-million property, but I have seen the cases where folks say prices are too low for them to sell. (Because it is a downturn and they are in hard times when they are old). It's a case of finding it hard to take bitter medicine.
 
btw since you namedrop that you live in landed property, are you retired too? How are you meeting lifestyle costs? Or are you younger and living with parents in their home?
Well I am reaching retirement, it is my own house. I manage my own financial to ensure that I do not need any source of funding other than myself. Those who said they are unable to sell their landed are because they have an unrealistic expectation or due to poor planning  or taking a much bigger bite than they could swallow, thats all I can say.

WTF, the article said this group makes up 6% of the 2.7mil adult citizen, and landed is only 5.1% the total dwelling households,  meaning many landed people are not paying tax !

1 husband pays income tax, wife does not.
 
2. wife pays, husband does not.
 
3. child (staying with parents) pays, retired parents do not.
 
4. no one in household pays income tax.
 
 
the non-paying ones from 1, 2, and 3 are part of 6%?
or only 4?
 
not clear from article.

half of the owners of the units i viewed in the past 2 months are in this group
 
they bought landed more than 10 or 15 years ago and have long fully paid up the loans
 
they are selling the landed to get two apartments, one for staying and one for rent

To be fair, the article did not say how many of these staying in private properties & not paying income tax needs state assistance.  May be a very small number.Maybe those are retiree or housewives
