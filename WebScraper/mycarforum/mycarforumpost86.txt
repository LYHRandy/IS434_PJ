It's my first time buying a property, encountered problems with the defects rectification process and the mgt. Appreciate advice from experienced property buyers. 
 
Condo developer is a big established one, didn't expect the unit to be handed over in a bad and uncompleted condition. Moreover TOP of this condo has been delayed for 4 months.
 
Among many other defects, the kitchen cabinet has many misalignments, a drawer track wasn't installed and was lying in the drawer (see pics), discoloration of cabinet surfaces, deep scratches on solid table top and stainless steel backing. Skirting missing. Chips on bathroom basin top. Marble flooring in living room was not polished and looks used. Dents on doors.
 
After joint inspection with construction supervisor and developer Rep, I handed a key to them to do defects. 
 
Few days later I checked, nth has been done as expected. But neighbour who already moved in alerted that the workers have been entering my unit at 9+pm,  wearing t-shirts and shorts, since the day I handed a key to the construction supervisor. 
 
I called defects team the next day and was advised to email my complaint. As expected, no reply nor response. Though they did a few minor defects. The big items like flooring etc all left undone. Only 2 weeks left before the one month defect rectification deadline is up, have a feeling they may tell me that those are not defects or not able to rectify. Or they may request more time though I already told them I need vacate my current residence by June.  
 
Though I can rectify the defects on my own after the one month and claim from developer, I'm not sure what complications may arise. Like developer not honouring the claim? 
 
I'm gg to meet a Rep from construction team regarding the defects. What stance should I take? 
 
Anyone with experience to advise?

Which condo is this？
 
Speak to MCST and or directly to Developer.
 
After the sales is done and the unit handed over, everybody siam extra work already.
 
Dont get too stressed
 
Not sure what you mean by stance
Why everything must have particular stance?
Just tell them the defects and get it rectified within an agreed timeframe.
You mean they are shirking responsibilities?
 
Of course you can express displeasure and ask for some form of compensation
But base on the terms of your contract it should be quite clear what is to be done by developer

I thought have a period (1 year ?) to do all these claims. wah, the drawer track is totally UNACCEPTABLE. They also have their own team to do handover to, someone is obviously skiving big time.
 
Go to online forums (renotalk/myhonetown etc) to see whether any owners having same problems as you, group together and go bang table ....

I think during this defect rectification period, make sure every defects is in black and white and sign off by the rep. I think even after defects rectification period, they must complete everything in the list.
 
As for the 9pm thingy, maybe your house become their dome. This one difficult to prove.

1. Take back the key.
2. Take 1 week AL 
3. Buy red tapes.
4. Get appointment with the rep.
5. With the help of friends or family members, inspect the whole house again and paste the red tape at anything you don't like. 
6. Number the defects and put them down on paper.
7. Show them to the rep.
8. Be nice to the rep. Buy him Starbucks coffee or lunch when discuss the list.
9. You must open the door for the repair team. Be nice to them, especially the 工头.
10. Buy them lunch, coke ice cream and coffee during break.
11. Do this everyday till all things is done.
12. You will be surprise, they will change something for you which you don't think it is defective. Because they are the expert and they know it is done wrongly.
13. Bang table will not solve your problem. Construction guys 吃软不吃硬。
14. Rectification work might take 1 month. You might have to move in while they continue the work.
Get those dusty works done first.
 
All the best.

Thanks all for your advice. 
 
 
Yes I think they are shrinking responsibilities and applying the delay tactics. Don't think they can get the defects done within 2 weeks. 
 
I think the workers use my unit as their rest and relax station. The mgt provides free Wi-Fi in the common areas and my MBR is able to get very strong Wi-Fi signal. All the more they won't want to complete the defect works and hand over the unit to me.
 
As for taking AL and attending to the workers, it's not possible as I'm in an industry with no annual leave, only a few days leave for private affairs but not for this kind of thing. I must admit I was very firm and assertive when I pointed out the defects to the construction supervisor(foreign worker), because I was totally pissed off with the quality of workmanship delivered and them sending a foreign worker to talk to me (the Rep from developer just stood one side as if none of his business). My friend said the construction supervisor looked very stressed when I spoke to him. Maybe that's why he decided to play punk with me.
 
Will try to use the soft approach when I meet the Rep on Mon. 
 
More pics of defects attached. Those who are getting new condos but inexperienced like me can take note. Skirting incomplete and hinge either faulty or not installed properly. Fortunately I got my interior designer to help me with the defects and she pointed out many areas which I would miss because I thought they are the norm. For example the whole patio floor tiles was full of paint and cement stains.

on hindsight ... for the past 3-5 years ... due to proliferation of condo like mushroom ... many projects are being rush rush rush resulting shady workmanship because of insufficient worker, tight schedule and chasing projects and extreme thin profit margin ... must cut here cut there ...

Your case seems to be extreme. I've seen some bad workmanship ones but yours seem to be more than that like incomplete skirting, hinges missing etc. Sounds like poor QC as well cos most developers will do a thorough check and also clean up the unit a last time before handing over keys.
Anyway good luck and hope it turns out well!

May I know what's LD? 
 
TOP delayed 4 months, when I called last Dec because the TOP was supposed to be end Dec, they told me TOP in Jan, then became Feb, March and finally I only collected keys almost end of April. I didn't make noise all the while because I see no point in rushing them if they are going to do a sloppy job to TOP earlier. So when I collected the keys I EXPECTED minimal defects and problems, and got a shock of my life to see the horrendous condition of the unit.
 
My neighbour who already moved in shared that she was the first batch to get the keys in March because she insisted on it. So now I know, they will entertain those who make noise. Btw she also shared her relative's unit in the same development has parquet flooring that is wet, I didn't ask abt the details.

I think first of all, don't get too frustrated or emotional about this first. Because if you do, I am sure the rep/supervisor will feel like you are bashing them.
 
Like someone said, you got to handle this nicely with the rep/supervisor guy. Do a give and take. For some of the smaller defects, get your renovation contractor to correct it. In that sense, the rep also knows you have been trying to help them as well and being fair about it. The thing about construction guys is that if they know you have give way and help, they will return you the favour far more than you asked them too.
 
Banging table and all that will only result in a lose lose for everyone. End of the day, it is you who has to stay inside the unit, so going that route will just prolong the issue.

I doubt LD is possible, unless drafted in contract which developer will not include such unfavorable terms in their sales contract to consumer. You can engage lawyer but that would only be during extreme stage. So the only sensible thing to do is to go through the full list of defects and have the developer acknowledge in B&W with the defects clearance dateline agreed and stated. 
 
Normally when a project is delayed, it's not a good sign. Definitely the delay is not for them to improve the quality of the project; It's most likely because they need more time to either settle or cover up the problems.

If the developer do not agree on the 'defects' listed by the owner - then may have to engage an assessor,
 
They will visit the property and submit a report of their observations.

Just went to the unit and found the MBR wardrobe door has new defect appearing. Corner of sliding door seems to be filed away, revealing the raw wood beneath. It was originally in good condition. 
 
Will meet the Rep tmr and hear his explanation. I also bought drinks and biscuits to put in the unit for the workers, though my friends and family members disapprove saying this is not the proper way. I just want the defects to be rectified.

Bear in mind that TOP date is non contractual. 
 
There is a systematic way of taking over and closing of defects. I presume developer has passed you an official list to fill in the defects and you have physically marked out what these defects are and hold a joint inspection with the developer's rep and signed off. (with you holding a copy)
 
The period to close the defects is mandated by law and if these are not done satisfactorily, you have recourse. Do not do any own repair or reno before this is closed.
 
A good developer would not ruin his own reputation by ignoring the dateline as it's really the responsibility of the contractor to attend and rectify these defects. Btw, you still haven't mention who is the developer. Why the big secret if you think they did a shoddy job? It's a matter of fact, not speculation what.

Liquidated damages are collected by developer and is not applicable to the purchasers. Purchasers can only claim from the builder under tort as a last resort. Before taking such an extreme and costly measure, there are several avenues a purchaser can take, for example, writing to the developer if the defects rectification is not done satisfactorily.
 
Meanwhile, stay cool like the rest say as there are laws to protect the purchaser. The developer's responsibility does not end after the 1-year defects liability period. There is another six years liability for latent defects that did not surface in the first year as well as those defects highlighted that they fail to rectify.
 
Next is to rally your neighbours (minimum 10%) to write to developer to call the 1st AGM to run the Management Corporation (MCST) and appoint your choice of Managing Agent (MA). Otherwise the developer may delay the process as long as possible since the MA who is appointed by them is unlikely to hound their paymaster for rectification of defects at common areas.

Get your lawyer to write to developer about the defect. Take picture and sent in your defect lsit to developer. You still hold i think 15% of the purchase price, so don't worry. Just make sure they know your defect. Sent reminder every month if not fixed. Yoy can engage your own contractor if you give them resonable time to fix, consult your lawyer to claim back from developer. My pervious condo flooring was bad, i engage contractor to change to equipvalent material and claim 15k from developer.

Definitely not true. My Sales and Purchase agreement has a clause for liquidated damages (drafted by the developer's lawyer too!).

There is a final 15% that your lawyer is still holding ... and you can request for your lawyer not to release any payment till all the defects are done.
 
All developers would want to TOP asap ... to get their money. The DoLC is the one that is in the S&P agreement, hence legally binding.

Temporary Occupancy Permit (TOP) means BCA has inspected the property and deem it fit for occupation but there are other legal and statutory requirements which the developer has yet to fulfill. This must be 100% complied before a Certificate of Substantial Completion (CSC) is issued and this must fall within the Date of Legal Completion. If developer miss this date, buyer has legal recourse to seek damages.

Definitely not true. My Sales and Purchase agreement has a clause for liquidated damages (drafted by the developer's lawyer too!).

 
My bad. I checked my S&P. There is 10% pa payable by the developer to purchaser for delay in handing over keys as well as completion of the S&P. There is also compensation if the unit is more than 3% smaller than the area stated in the S&P.

Should be Certificate of Statutory Completion issued by BCA. Certificate of Substantial Completion is issued by the Qualified Person or Lead Consultant for the building contract.

To name the developer now, is as good as banging the table.
TS should use the soft approach first....
If all things fail then .... flip table!
 
 

Yes that's what I'm thinking,Thanks for understanding. 
 
They sent 4 guys to meet me: 2 Reps from developer team (one is resident engineer),  the construction supervisor K (foreign worker) who did joint inspection with me and boss of supervisor (foreign worker from Country P).
 
Developer team reps reached first, they appeared apologetic but were very careful with their words, did not commit to anything, did not give any opinion. When questioned abt the workers entering unit at night, the resident engineer answered contractor conducting investigation. When I questioned why unit handed over in bad condition, no QC done? They kept quiet.
 
Then Boss of supervisor asked whether we have cctv footage of the workers entering unit at night. I directed the question to developer team, they say no cctv at the location. Boss of supervisor then say the workers have to go ard to all units doing defects to check that doors and windows are all closed at night. I countered that no defects were rectified over the days they entered the units and why need half hour to check my unit's doors and windows? He couldnt answer, then admitted they may be doing other business inside. 
 
I went through the undone defects and newly appeared defects (apparently caused by the workers) with them. K's boss there and then repeatedly told K to get them rectified because they are not difficult. K claimed he planned to do them today. K's boss also readily acknowledged that a no. of items are really defective and shd be replaced but he told me frankly that he needs up to 6 weeks for the stock to come in, so he'll owe me those items till stock comes in but I can start my reno or even move in because those are not critical items. He seemed frank and sincere (I could be wrong).
 
I didn't raise my voice, I merely raised my doubts and point out the facts and the defects. I tried persuading K's boss to commit to rectifying in one week's time but he stood very firm that they'll need 2 weeks but will try to deliver earlier if possible. Fair enough, according to contract they have one month to rectify defects, but I also emphasized I do not want any delay beyond the one month. Developer team Reps behaved diplomatically but they did comment that the chippings at the washbasin top were bad.
 
From now on will monitor the progress very closely. If K still doesn't start work, I'm going to hound his boss.

There is no deadline for obtaining CSC in the S&P for my condo. It just entitles the developer to collect 8% of the progress payment. However, most developers will often use CSC as a reason to initiate the completion of the S&P.

It is better to get all the wet works done first. You will need to check for hollowness on the entire wall and floor area using a tapping rod. The defects on solid surfacing top, cabinet, wardrobe, doors, windows and other fixtures can be done a later stage with relatively little inconvenience.

Hollowness in floor has been checked using a coin. 2 hollow points in kitchen found, anyway the kitchen flooring very uneven. K seems reluctant to rectify it though his boss told him to get it done. I'm not optimistic abt the kitchen flooring. 
 
As for wall hollowness... didn't know have to check. Some parts of the wall are only partitions in the first place...

Hmmm well we behaved in a civilized manner (no flipping table yet) but I will only conclude that it's fruitful if defects are satisfactorily rectified by 25 May.
 
Anyway I emailed them with the list of discussion points today But I doubt they'll reply because nobody wants to commit to anything.

Better check if there is any water seepage into your unit especially after heavy and long downpour.  This one is a hidden flaw and water keeps seeping in, it will damage furniture and parquet flooring.

The bedroom partitions are usually dry walls which are two boards with rockwool in between and will sound hollow. This is not a defect. You only need to check for the party wall (between your unit and neighbouring unit), kitchen wall and toilet wall.

It's my first time buying a property, encountered problems with the defects rectification process and the mgt. Appreciate advice from experienced property buyers. 
 
Condo developer is a big established one, didn't expect the unit to be handed over in a bad and uncompleted condition. Moreover TOP of this condo has been delayed for 4 months.
 
Among many other defects, the kitchen cabinet has many misalignments, a drawer track wasn't installed and was lying in the drawer (see pics), discoloration of cabinet surfaces, deep scratches on solid table top and stainless steel backing. Skirting missing. Chips on bathroom basin top. Marble flooring in living room was not polished and looks used. Dents on doors.
 
After joint inspection with construction supervisor and developer Rep, I handed a key to them to do defects. 
 
Few days later I checked, nth has been done as expected. But neighbour who already moved in alerted that the workers have been entering my unit at 9+pm,  wearing t-shirts and shorts, since the day I handed a key to the construction supervisor. 
 
I called defects team the next day and was advised to email my complaint. As expected, no reply nor response. Though they did a few minor defects. The big items like flooring etc all left undone. Only 2 weeks left before the one month defect rectification deadline is up, have a feeling they may tell me that those are not defects or not able to rectify. Or they may request more time though I already told them I need vacate my current residence by June.  
 
Though I can rectify the defects on my own after the one month and claim from developer, I'm not sure what complications may arise. Like developer not honouring the claim? 
 
I'm gg to meet a Rep from construction team regarding the defects. What stance should I take? 
 
Anyone with experience to advise?

if say delayed for half a year, its quite a lot of opportunity cost that has gone wasted.

Firstly, there are standards that developers need to adhere as outline by our authorities. These standards suppose to get higher with passing of time. In addition, there are inspection of the development by authorities at various stages of the development.
 
Secondly, the number of defects are beyond believed. Shocking.
 
Hence, someone is sleeping on the job.
 
I am sure there are many more new first time owners. I wondered how many does not know how to seek redress and fork out their own money to make repairs.
 
The authorities really need to re-examine their process of inspection and safe guard consumers. Consumer council can take up the case as it must be a country wide problem.

Yes someone is sleeping on the job. That's why when I asked the duo from Developer why no QC, someone sleeping on the job? They just kept quiet. 
 
They didn't complete the units properly, then hand over the units to us, start collecting maintenance fees (mine is almost $400 a month) upon handover, then make us wait long long while they sit on the defects without doing anything. Really not fair to us. We are the ones paying for their incompetence. And of course opportunity costs from the delay in TOP and moving in. 
 
Managed to join a closed FB group for owners yesterday, many of them have similar (if not worse) defects and experiences. No defect rectification carried out after 2 weeks of joint inspection  and patronising responses from construction team are very common.  An owner even paid more than 1k for a professional to identify all the defects because the condition of the unit is really bad. Of course there are some lucky ones with relatively few and minor defects. Really a matter of heng suay.
 
A colleague suggested going to CASE but I doubt it'll help. 
 
Hope this thread can also serve other home buyers well by providing info on defects to look out for, defects rectification process etc.

They have one month to rectify defects reported. After one month not rectified, owners must give them a chance to rectify within 2 weeks. Still not rectified, owner can inform them that we want to rectify ourselves and claim cost from them.

I think during this defect rectification period, make sure every defects is in black and white and sign off by the rep. I think even after defects rectification period, they must complete everything in the list.

You need to know your right when you buy property. Singapore law is very well covered for new condo purchase. You just need to read up and understand the law. The developer had to rectify the problem if they want the last 10% payment. Engage your lawyer that represent you for the purchase, make them work for you as you are paying them to ensure the transaction go thru without problem. I can't remember how many letter they write for me to the developer to fight the defect and I don't have to pay extra. The developer will tell all the story say go sue them as they know many buyer is not aware of the law. I check with my lawyer the right process to give developer enough warning to rectify and then fix it myself. I than  go to small claim court and  they then willing to settle as they know I am serious and I know my right.

There are two deadlines in the S&P, one for hand over of keys and another for completion of the S&P.
The collection of keys must be after TOP while the completion can be either before or after CSC but usually the latter.
If any of the two deadlines are not met, you will get compensated at 10% per annum based on the instalments paid by you calculated on daily basis.
The developer will usually put in sufficient buffer to protect themselves. I collected my keys more than 1 year before the hand over deadline and completed the S&P more than 2 years  before the completion deadline.

thanks bro for the heads up.
 
i would agree with you that the developer will put in clauses that will safe guard them.
 
But the slow down sale of  new flats might make it possible , though rare. Gone are the days where people need to ballot to choose their units or throw cheques at agents

I believe for unsold units when the project has obtained TOP or CSC, the marketing team will revise the S&P, unless the entire team is blur like sotong

Thanks to advice given by some forummers, the defects in my unit have been properly rectified 3 days before due date. Now the unit is in a clean and good condition, if it was handed over to me in this condition in the first place, I would be very pleased.  
 
As some forummers guessed,yes it is Hedges Park.
 
Realized that the reason they want one month to do rectification is their lack of manpower, and workers just doing their own portion of rectification and having no qualms about damaging other parts of the unit in the process, so more defects appeared during defects rectification. For example the newly polished kitchen top was badly scratched by someone, presumably a worker, cutting things with a blade on it (see pic). The evening before post rectification  handover, I checked and found two dozen defects, some new and some outstanding. I consolidated everything and sent an email to them at 10am, by 4pm everything was done swee swee. So actually most of the defects can be rectified very quickly but because they only have a small team working, they drag the whole process and inevitably attend to the more 'urgent' cases first.

Thanks to advice given by some forummers, the defects in my unit have been properly rectified 3 days before due date. Now the unit is in a clean and good condition, if it was handed over to me in this condition in the first place, I would be very pleased.
 
As some forummers guessed,yes it is Hedges Park.
 
Realized that the reason they want one month to do rectification is their lack of manpower, and workers just doing their own portion of rectification and having no qualms about damaging other parts of the unit in the process, so more defects appeared during defects rectification. For example the newly polished kitchen top was badly scratched by someone, presumably a worker, cutting things with a blade on it (see pic). The evening before post rectification handover, I checked and found two dozen defects, some new and some outstanding. I consolidated everything and sent an email to them at 10am, by 4pm everything was done swee swee. So actually most of the defects can be rectified very quickly but because they only have a small team working, they drag the whole process and inevitably attend to the more 'urgent' cases first.

 
Lian Beng?
 
Now you need to get someone to sand out the scratches.

Hedges Park is developed by Tripartite Developers Pte Ltd which if not mistaken is made up of Hong Leong, CDL and 1 other developer. Surprised at the poor workmanship as those 2 are quite reputable developers.
 
These days, besides the developer, think the Main Contractor is also important. My ex-colleague husband who is a Condo Manager mentioned that Dragages (French Main Cont who build our National Stadium) is quite good and their quality control is commendable.

Good to hear that it has all been sorted out.  So things were settled quite amicably right?

Yes thanks to advice from you and a few other kind souls who shared experiences. I bought the workers lots of drinks, biscuits and fruits, invited them to help themselves to the snacks. I also communicated to the supervisor calmly and nicely, he also reciprocated.
 
Will be bringing more food for the supervisor and his team when I next go there. I think they are really quite overworked.

I did not expect the workmanship to be so bad and the unit to be delivered in a very dirty state. If it were some small or foreign developer, maybe not surprising. Guess the QC is lacking because some people in the team have been loafing on the job, but it is up to the developer to investigate and take action if they value their reputation.
 
Maybe the plus point about buying from big company is that at least the customer service so far is good, whenever I call the developer to ask about TOP date, and defects team about the defects issues, they respond professionally and efficiently.

What I have heard from some contractors is that the foreign workers quota is giving many companies a huge headache in terms of manpower.
 
In the past, when I ordered something from some supplier, they could always deliver. Now gotta pick up most of the stuff myself due to lack of manpower.
 
Could it be the case for some of these issues with these builders?

Honestly I do wonder if it's more cost effective to build quickly with numerous defects and to set up a team to rectify it over time with lots of negative press, or to build precisely and minimise defects so less of follow up issues and bad press / advertisements, which will manifest in good reviews and resale prices / confidence over time.
 
Maybe Toronto does not have professional grumblers and complainers like we do. I admit I can complain pretty well if I choose to do so, so not really pointing fingers at anyone.

I'm an owner of hedges Park condo. Well, I'm the first batch to collect the keys. There are defects as usual and its not something new to me.
 
They took less than a month to rectify the reported problems while I get my contractor to fix the lighting and curtains.
 
All the jobs get done promptly. Probably I kept pestering the boss and he summons his man over to rectify the problem. 
 
I'm satisfied with the end results and its quality for Hedges Park.
 
I've seen many much worst quality from other developers.
 
Have been staying for more than 6 months and everything works well.
 
Love the traveling time to CDB via ECP from the east. It takes less than 20 minutes for the journey.
 
Was staying in north-east area previously and travel via KPE to CBD took 45 mins. That's a lot of time which I've saved.

I also moved from north-east to hedges park. Travelling to workplace in Jurong via PIE is now smoother, less than 30mins on normal days, save about 10mins per trip. Not used to the traffic jam at the sengkang punggol area now, always encounter jams when I return there to visit family, even on weekend afternoons, not to mention weekday evening peak period. With the development at punggol and serangoon, can imagine how bad the traffic will be in future. 
 
It's really a resort feel condo, relaxing. Build quality is reasonable. 
 
Can't fathom the behavior of some residents though. Just saw an auntie wash her clothes in the carpark car wash bay this evening, had them in ntuc plastic bags and used the bags to hold the water while she scrub the clothes. Saw her wash her dirty-looking white dog in the car wash bay before. I wonder what else she's going to wash there in future, I hope not herself.

1. Take back the key.
2. Take 1 week AL
3. Buy red tapes.
4. Get appointment with the rep.
5. With the help of friends or family members, inspect the whole house again and paste the red tape at anything you don't like.
6. Number the defects and put them down on paper.
7. Show them to the rep.
8. Be nice to the rep. Buy him Starbucks coffee or lunch when discuss the list.
9. You must open the door for the repair team. Be nice to them, especially the 工头.
10. Buy them lunch, coke ice cream and coffee during break.
11. Do this everyday till all things is done.
12. You will be surprise, they will change something for you which you don't think it is defective. Because they are the expert and they know it is done wrongly.
13. Bang table will not solve your problem. Construction guys 吃软不吃硬。
14. Rectification work might take 1 month. You might have to move in while they continue the work.
Get those dusty works done first.
 
All the best.

I heard similar story from my friend. This local couple will shower at the condo common toilets everyday after work. Thereafter, they will camp at the function room area so that they can get free electricity to charge their laptops while they spend their evening surfing net there. So doesnt mean stay condo is very rich ok. Some cannot afford to even pay for basic utilities. Jin cham sia.

I think main problem is the quality of foreign workers n material costs r too high or raised too fast. So profit got squeeze therefore quality drop.
Small Developer also need to bid high else no project also die. Bid high nobody buy also die. Therefore land cost high.
Now is a matter of who blinks developers or buyers.

She looks like a local Chinese, though I may be wrong. So far didn't see many PRCs around and those I've seen are civilized, they don't make noise at the common areas, even the little kids will talk softly.
 
It's those from the other country with a long period of 'civilisation' that irk me. Blasting their TV at night (very distinctive, in their language and the typical run-around-coconut-tree music). Making noise at common areas past midnight, refuse to leave. Worse is the guards very scared of this group of residents, one even told me that he got scolded when trying to do his job (maintain order).

I feel so sorry for TS to spend so much of his hard earned money and to be disappointed by the purchase. Tried reading all the contributions but as I read, I got distracted by various other comments which is not directly linked to the defects he is referring to.
 
Just my 2-cent opinion. It is important to know the developer you are entering into the contract. If this is a small developer, likely they don't care much about their reputation thus the product quality.
 
Our construction industry has changed for a number of years. Quality is very lacking due to the way contracts are being awarded today. Look at the construction industry, if you look at the labour they used, you will be shock they managed to put up the buildings. We are building Lego set now, cheap and fast with the most easily available materials.
 
To get people to move, sometimes you do need to spend some money to get legal help, if you find the defects not acceptable and really need to be rectified. Whatever you have registered within the defect liability period, these defects are locked in, no expiry till they get rectified as far as I know. Liquidated damages only applies if you suffer the loss of the enjoyment of your property. For minor defects, I don't think you can pursue under this line. Best to get legal advice.
 
Sometime, you may be dealing with the wrong party. It is also good to write officially to the company, if need to the Board for their attention. Photographs are very good evidence to show what you are claiming.

Well, I was disappointed because it isn't a small developer, all the more don't expect that kind of workmanship. 
 
To keep costs low, plus locals generally stay away from these tough construction work, they using low-skilled foreign workers. So quality of work is a real problem, can only get them to rectify again and again until issue solved. But at least the materials used are of reasonable to good standard (according to my ID). 
 
Can only say, during the process of getting the house ready for moving in, Murphy's Law applies. Needs tonnes of patience, resilience and assertiveness, the staff quality of service providers really makes me wonder how the companies function. 
 
For example, signed up for Home Hub service with SH, on day of installation technician only came with broadband equipment, cable tv box not provided. Call customer service many times, waited half day no one able to tell me what happened. Finally someone told me I need to wait one week for them to re-arrange the set up of cable tv which was missed out by them in the first place. I insisted that it has to be done asap, second day they sent someone down to do the job.
 
Bought Philips TV from C****, the sales staff told me installation of TV mounting has to be arranged with Philips directly, they even wrote that instruction down on the invoice. I called Philips, was told that since I bought from C****, the TV mounting is to be arranged with C****. Fine, so I called C**** to make appointment, however on the day of appointment, no-show, I called C****, they claimed that they cannot find any records of my call, told me to wait a few days while they get someone down. I insisted they need to do it that very day, they did manage to send someone down, and apologized for the inconvenience created.
 
 

I feel so sorry for TS to spend so much of his hard earned money and to be disappointed by the purchase. Tried reading all the contributions but as I read, I got distracted by various other comments which is not directly linked to the defects he is referring to.
 
Just my 2-cent opinion. It is important to know the developer you are entering into the contract. If this is a small developer, likely they don't care much about their reputation thus the product quality.
 
Our construction industry has changed for a number of years. Quality is very lacking due to the way contracts are being awarded today. Look at the construction industry, if you look at the labour they used, you will be shock they managed to put up the buildings. We are building Lego set now, cheap and fast with the most easily available materials.
 
To get people to move, sometimes you do need to spend some money to get legal help, if you find the defects not acceptable and really need to be rectified. Whatever you have registered within the defect liability period, these defects are locked in, no expiry till they get rectified as far as I know. Liquidated damages only applies if you suffer the loss of the enjoyment of your property. For minor defects, I don't think you can pursue under this line. Best to get legal advice.
 
Sometime, you may be dealing with the wrong party. It is also good to write officially to the company, if need to the Board for their attention. Photographs are very good evidence to show what you are claiming.

From the series of replies and sharing, it looks like there is a business to opportunity. Someone could set up a One-stop service to provide people like TS. Pay them a fee to manage all the issues and coordination. Viable?

But this is a labour intensive service so you still end up with the same problems as the construction companies.

I question why is warranty for a new property only lasts 1 year. It simply allows developer to do shoddy work and wash their hands off when things are about to go wrong. 
 
Often many issues will only surface after a year of usage,like pipe leaking, aircon ducting not done properly etc. 
 
Even a car has three years warranty minimum!

if developer is enforced to give 3 years warranty by law
extra cost will just pass on to consumer ... pay higher price and get even smaller unit ... HK style 350-500sqft
BTO/DBSS also have to give 3 years warranty ... HDB also got no confidence la ... lol
