the waterpipes at home is making loud constant 'duuuu' noise when we turn on tap, flush toilet, use washing machine. it sounds like as if its going to vibrate and burst.
 

ended up we cannot turn on the water volume too fast n too much to avoid the sound.
 

what can I do? sld I call town council or HDB or PUB? Will adjusting water valve works?

maybe 1 of the area of the pipe needs to put 1 extra clip.

check which area that is not hold tight by the clip.

Try this
 

Check your main inlet valve.  Make sure it is fully opened.

+1. 
 

Incoming water supply' pressure could be too high. If so, reduce the opening at the control valve.
 

Do the same thing to isolating valves at each supply point should also helps.

I think its the resonance effect of the pipe and the water flow frequency.
 

You can try reducing or increasing the water flow at the main level control

I thought water pipe noises are the cause of the marble falling noises in HDB.
 

Anyway, for your issue, it depends on which part of the pipe that is causing the noise. HDB sometimes will say the issue if caused by upstairs. Quite leychey. 
 

Suggest you source around for any friends who knows plumping or piping.

I suggest you call your own plumber to investigate.  Could be caused by faulty fittings.  Dont think it's under the purview of PUB nor town council.

I had the same problem before.
 

I adjusted the main valve and each control valve, especially the valve to the cistern. High pressure causes very loud noise!

The reason for the adjust of the water pressure is to avoid the resonance.
 

So if main water control is set to high , inner water control have to set  lower.
 

or  vise verse.  This is to basically trying to avoid the resonance freq betw the 
 

water flow and the pipe. Of course this is assuming there is no other problem eg
 

leaking or some connecting pipe are loose.etc. Another possiblility is that you 
 

have some area where  pipe holders are too far apart . 
 

This is what I experiences. If doesnt help , then got to get the expert Mario  :-)

and to ease the loud constant sound, the only way is to turn on the tap to let the water flow when the sound is created from flushing toilet.
 

when the washing machine is drawing water from pipe, the toilet tap will leak water by itself and u have to turn off it and the sound will disappear.

Same problem + leaking. Called a plumber last week and he said it is due to the taps' internal structure. Changed the taps and all problems gone.

Its called "water hammer", a plumber will be able to help you. 
 

I had the same encounter at my place, faucets would vibrate and pipes sounded like they were going to fall apart.
 

Mine was caused by a faulty flushing mechanism, plumber changed the entire plastic assembly and problem was solved.

problem solved.
 

the leaking tap in the bathroom changed and solved the loud sound.
 

that tap will leak whenever we flush toilet, shower or use washing machine...that's the source of problem.
 

thanks everyone for input.

NPC chaps came and checked,  it seemed the whole block here got this problem due to water tank upgrading works. 
 
No idea of it as I do not read the notice board. 
 
But they did speak to the upstairs neighbour and it is quieter now.  *touch wood*

likely a repair was done in the toilet and some of the piping needed to be opened up and air trapped inside during the repair.
Once the repair done, usually the gushing sound appeared anywhere from cistern up to the piping area until a long time the sound will fade off as "trapped air" is crawling out!
 
Just like an operation in the hospital, there bound to be some air trapped in the body and take time to push out and can be uncomfortable.
