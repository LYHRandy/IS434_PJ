Any one can recommend contractor or company to install wood deck strips on patio?
 
Patio size about 300 sq ft or less.
 
Any tips on what kind of wood or material to use for our weather?
 
I know there are real wood and WPC, and some other artificial material.
 
I need something that doesn't retain heat and lesser maintenance fuss.
 
Real wood will get discoloration over time? Must vanish regularly? 
 
What's the cost of the vanishing?

That's right - real wood even chengai needs to be maintained with wood oil etc. They will eventually need to be replaced in 15 years or 20 if outdoor.
 
Tiles (wood like) is better if not under direct sunlight. Can wash or mop easily.

our weather simply not suitable for wooden deck. High maintenance unless you don't mind the effect.
 
Even timber deck is hot under thiis direct sun. I would suggest adding trellis if this is an area you wish to utilise. otherwise grass is best.

Exciting times to get something new.
 
Few things.
 
1) Choose what type of wood you want.
 

 
2) Gaps in between the deck. 2 to 3mm is recommended.
 

 
3) Structure. The decking should be level with the ground & the joints should be strong with each pieces interlocking with each other in a safe and secure manner.
 

 
4) Treat the wood! Get it water and termite resistant!! Young chengal woods will not be resistant to water and insect. Ask the contractor how old is the wood.

I use real wood for my balcony. Think it's chengai. I mop once a week, and on days when it rains, I mop it dry when I reach home. It's been 3 years, condition is still good.

 
The same wood in my planter looks more chui cos I don't maintain it.
 
It's done by my ID as a package so I don't have any specific flooring expert to recommend.  However, i hope this link helps in your decision making

I agree. Real wood decking is not hard to maintain.  Nothing beats real wood in terms of feel and look, especially as it ages.  But I am biased as I prefer wood over marble and tiles, so spending a couple of hundreds every 5 years or so, if necessary to polish and re-varnish, is acceptable to me.  I have done it for my parquet flooring. 
If you eventually opt for wood decking, do pay more for old mature wood, horizontal and yet random layout (plank orientation) and wider and longer planks.

Useful info! Thanks 
So looks like Changal wood is the more suitable.

Problem is parquet need to grind and varnish. Pain to move everything to do it. The smell is also terrible for a few days. My place is parquet and I have been sitting on it to redo.

My place is parquet and I have been sitting on it to redo.Can't really use the room for at least a day, IIRC.  But you get an almost new flooring after as all the scratches and dents are removed.

For outdoor probably most suitable. But Chengai can still rot due to water from personal experience.

No. The water will seep through and for every balcony, there is drainage.
