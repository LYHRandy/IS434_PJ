Visit the HDB website above.
 
According to HDB, the median rent for 4-room flats in SG is $1180 for Q207.
i think Farrer Road should be under Queenstown, and the median rent for Queenstown is $1300.
 
which means your rent of $1300 is above average on a national level and average on local level... so i guess there is room for a little upward adjustments.
 
but renovation plays a part too. if your flat is in "original" condition, ie, little or no reno, then don't expect too high. on the other hand if your flat is nicely done up, then it's a different story.

U can't take the national level to compare...his place should be around 2.5K. Even my jurong east flat got offers of up to 2.5K three months ago.

I am renting too. The sky rocketing rental rate make me   and  
Obviously, the owner can charge a much higher rental rate than what the tenant is currently paying. I am in the same shoes   And I feel the pain...

S$2.4 is very very good rental.

Thanks Bro, good info. Didn't know about this being available. I did some checking on other websites, think if current figures put together with these will give a more current picture.

$2.4K is really high for HDB 4 room. I'm way surprised that rental has moved so much. Good for your friend, he is very fortunate. 
 
I think lots of middle-management expats are going for value for money HDB instead of paying much higher for condos.
 
Bro, thanks again!

Careful bro. This is illegal. If you read the HDB's T&C for subletting, you'll realise this is not a loophole as many people thought.

Did you seek HDB approval ? If yes, base on what you mention, it can be consider as a 3 room rental only, as they only have the usage of 2 rooms. 
 
The rental amount issues here now dont have any black or white rules. What the HDB do is only give a range of prices so that ppl are inform of what is the prices like in similar area. But as long as one is willing to pay what the other ask, its a deal. The trick is finding someone who is willing to pay what you are asking.

Your location for 4-rm is about 1.2k ~ 1.6k. 
5-rm around 1.4k ~ under 2k. 
 
To my advise, don't believe too much on agents who talk big... they purposly tell you a high figure (example: more than 2k), so that it will make you feel greedy, engage with him and won't look elsewhere or other agents.
But when it comes to a real deal, 2k is almost imposssible unless you are real lucky.
 
Got many agent also say my friend's house rental is 2k...3k, when ask to put deposit or sign black & white, no one eager about the deal and back off, finally settle with a price like yours...
If rental above 2k, the person must as well rent a smaller private apartment with a location slightly further

ok, if you have confirmation from HDB officer, then go ahead. but i suggest you get it in written form for your own protection. 
 
In my previous post, I was referring to this HDB policy for Subletting of Rooms: http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10206p.nsf/WP...ms?OpenDocument
 
At the bottom of the above site there is this T&C: "Owners and all the authorised occupiers must at all times be in continuous physical occupation of the flat."
 
Note that there is another policy for Subletting of Whole Flat but i don't think you fall into this one becuase this needs written approval from HDB which i'm sure you do not have since you intend to lock one room.
 
 
This is my opinion. I could be wrong. btw, can share what the HDB officer told you?

Yeah, I was also under the impression that the lock one rm scenario was possible then i checked and sorting it out with HDB...
 
Yup, must be in continuous physical occupation.  That I just got to know.  Which is why the 'lock one room' theory being applied by many is actually not allowed.
 
Sorting that out with HDB, in writing of course.  Never do things verbally.. haha... when things bite me in the ass a few yrs later, the HDB officer who spoke to me probably quit liao!  nobody to verify.. then i suck thumb..

Folks, my earlier post was written wrongly in a haste. What I was trying to say is; I may have unintentionally gave some the wrong idea. I have all the required paperwork required by law to rent out the whole flat . 
 
Do Not go on the wrong side of the law, it is not worth it.

You are certainly not in the market... 
 
Prices has really risen by that much. 
 
2.4k in farrer and holland rd (condition well renovated) is considered normal.
 
Condos..    High High lor

Not necessary so, there are some who choose to use one room as storeroom type.

that's not right. if he has sought permission, he is supposed to rent out the whole flat and get out totally. 
 
it's either the owner rent out the whole flat and get out totally OR rent out the rooms and at the same time stay there himself. no such thing as renting out the whole flat and using one room as storeroom (then how can call renting out whole flat??).
 
if owner uses one room as his personal storeroom, it is not considered renting out the whole flat. it is considered renting out the rooms only. when renting out rooms, owner is supposed to physically stay in the same flat. if he does not stay there he is breaking the law.

Hello, I think you not familiar with S'pore market... you cannot compare with HK.
He is renting only a HDB (not an private apartment) and it is only a small 4-rm.
It is almost impossible to rent out 2.4k even in farrer rd (unless you are lucky)... I can ganrantee at most 1.6k nia. Yes, price has risen but still very difficult...
 
Why?
 
Because the market for this category is very small. Main market is on both extreme...
 
Ang mo/foreign executive/professional only want private apartment or condo. They usually look for private housing that is more than 4k... some even 10k, and is normally paid by company.
Who will rent HDB?... Confirm not Singaporean, usually only PR.
 
For PR, they usually look for HDB less than 2k or just a room.
If a PR can afford >2k rental... I am sure that they will rather buy a resale flat because the installment confirm less than 2k.

Well.. I moonlight as agent before coming to HK lar...  
 
Believe it or not, I PERSONALLY handled 4 rooms rental at holland close (next to cemetry, somemore) at 2.5k. Partial furnished... Respond was so good. Once I place a  advert, more then 10 groups came and I had 4-5 FIRM offers with cheque. Fianlly, had to present all the offers to owner to pick his comfortable profile. Some viewers even beg me lei...wha lau,damn terok man...(in my heart I was thinking ,siao pay so much for HDB, still need to beg to get the flat)
 
Its no fluke, I did a few units around ghim moh,farrer road,dover,tiong bahru all at crazy price.
 
The market is different recently, the reason of high prices is due to expats being chase out from their condos... what used to be 2.5k normal condo rental suddenly shot up to 4-6k... crazy if you ask me.. these ang mohs,PRs or locals,actually got no choice but to shift out of these well placed condos. At the same time, they still want to be closer to town.. HOW ? HDB flats lor.
 
Yes, buying flats is a option for PRs... but buy where.. Brand new more affordable but location..hmmm need i say more. Buy resale in prime areas, no 20k cash, forget it.
 
Its crazy if u ask me... but thats the market.
 
For the record, my own 5 room in Sengkang was rented out at 2.2k. SENGKANG.... I also shock, but i am not complaining..why should I.
 
Lastly, a house is a house. Its how u market it. PM me if anyone wants to get good rental. Of course not me doing cos I in HK... my buddy can help.

Ah Huat, the locking of one room theory is just a tactic which the house owner employ to buy some time should the HDB people decide to spring a surprise visit at your home. Cos with the room locked, your tenant can claim that u're out at work when in actual fact, you're not living at the house at all.

Wah lau...pay HKD$35,000/mth and you call pigeon hole. You must be staying at Central or near Admirity, 3 bedroom apartment.
 
I left HK 2 years ago, Wan Chai area 640 sq.ft was already HKD$11,000 / mth.
 
Think about it, SG housing is still inexpensive.

correct.. the way around it is to appeal and not lock one room like i thought.. I learnt that it helps to call HDB once in a while!!
