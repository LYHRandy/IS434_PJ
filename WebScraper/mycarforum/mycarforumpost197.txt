A FLAT owner's bid to challenge the HDB's move to take back his five-room unit ended yesterday when the Housing Board told the High Court it will withdraw its notice of intent to acquire the flat.
 

Mr Chew Teck Fatt in return agreed not to proceed with his judicial review application.
 

Justice Woo Bih Li, who made no order on the application, ruled that HDB pay Mr Chew's legal costs at the closed-door hearing.
 

Yesterday's turn of events staved off a potential landmark case on whether the decisions of the HDB and the office of the Minister of National Development can be the subject of judicial review.
 

When contacted last night, Mr Chew, a 38-year-old company director, said he was about to leave for Taiwan in the morning with a "heavy heart" as this matter had caused him stress for about two years. But "I felt very relieved and happy when my lawyer Kirpal called me and said the case was withdrawn, just as I was about to board the plane".
 

An HDB spokesman The Straits Times spoke to warned that the board "takes a serious view of any unauthorised subletting as HDB flats are primarily meant for owner occupation.
 

"In this particular case, as additional information had surfaced after Mr Chew had filed his court application, we decided to give him the benefit of doubt...
 

"This avoids unnecessary litigation in court and will save both time and costs for the court and all the parties concerned."
 

Mr Chew had bought the resale flat along Bukit Batok Street 25 for $480,000 in 2010.
 

The next year, he let out a room to a couple and then a second to a Taiwanese man whose child went to school here. In both cases, he had HDB's approval.
 

But a probe by HDB officers, which included surveillance of the flat and interviews with the tenants, found that he was not living there.
 

It is a longstanding HDB policy that where an owner does not stay in his flat during the period of subletting, this would be evidence that the whole unit was being rented out. Subletting an entire flat without approval is against the rules, and can lead to the HDB compulsorily acquiring the unit.
 

But Mr Chew denied renting out the whole flat and claimed he kept the third room for his use. He also said that there were times when he worked late or stayed at his mother's place at Jalan Bahagia in Balestier.
 

At issue in the case would have been whether there must be continuous physical occupation of the flat before Mr Chew can be said to have abandoned his interest in the unit and was wholly subletting it illegally.
 

At yesterday's hearing, the court was informed that both HDB and the minister would notify Mr Chew in writing that they would not pursue their notice of intent to re-acquire his flat made in December 2011 and January 2012 respectively. The minister's decision is made after any aggrieved party appeals to his office in a compulsory acquisition notice by HDB.

probably information about his business or work committments in taiwan that requires him to be often away in taiwan and so it becomes like he didn't purposely not stay in his own house.

i think hdb's reasoning of "new facts surfaced" is just a red herring for their about turn.  most likely during the appeals, he would have tried to show them his passport already as you surmised.  hdb officials probably (like most stat board front line staff) are trained to reject any reasonings put forward, thought they have the upper hand and no need listen to reasons of this hdb flat owner.
 

now that judicial review is on the way, their balls shrank and they have to use a glorified reason like this to eat the humble pie.

I suspect many are doing such act, without the HDB approval. This is just one of too many such. No one tip-off, nothing happens. Partly, they are warning to those who have that kind of intention to do so.

Even if you buy your flat on open market without using CPF, you cannot rent out the whole flat as there is MOP. perhaps HDB acted on the presumption that Chew had rented out the entire flat. 
 

Also no mention of which month he bought the flat. Apparently buying the resale flat before Aug 2010, MOP = 3 yrs and buying after Aug 2010, MOP = 5 years

Government shortlists potential sites to build retirement village 

By Serene Loo and Julia , Channel NewsAsia, 17 April 2006
 

SINGAPORE : The government has shortlisted a few potential sites for the construction of a retirement village, and the National Development Ministry is currently studying the details.
 

The sites are on a 30-year land lease.
 

And one of them will be picked to test market demand for such villages.
 

In an exclusive interview with MediaCorp's Channel 8, Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan said in the past, the idea of building retirement villages was put on the back burner as Singapore's problem of an ageing population was not as serious as that in Europe and America.
 

The Singapore market was also too small for retirement villages to be commercially viable.
 

But the prospects have since changed.
 

With a rapidly ageing Singapore population, Mr Khaw said in five years' time, retirement villages will become economically viable.
 

One obstacle is the high costs of land in Singapore.
 

"My personal view is, our land is expensive. But we have nearby neighbours in Johore, Batam and Bintan. The elderly want to reach their doctors within half to one hour. So retirement villages in neighbouring countries is possible, barring the cross-border hassle. It is best to find cheap land on short leases," said Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan.

Khaw Boon Wan: consider living in nursing homes in JB
 

Straits Times, 10 Feb 2009
 

SINGAPOREANS could consider living in nursing homes in neighbouring Johor Baru, Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan suggested yesterday.
 

It would be cheaper, yet be near enough to Singapore for family members to visit and for residents to return for medical care if necessary, he said.
 

He told Parliament yesterday that he recently visited a site in Johor Baru where a Singaporean investor was planning to build a 200-bed nursing home.
 

He asked the investor about the costs involved, and was stunned at how low they were.
 

He said:

Thanks ts, this is definitely a good read.
 

I too am thinking of leasing out 2 of my rooms when time comes.

Legally with hdb awareness.
 

Likelihood, i will be locking my master room as the legendary locked room ritual. Haha.

As i will not be in Singapore most of the time, my family members will have a spare key.
 

I should be fine, hor.
 

No letter or whatever, as its my own business registered under wife to be.

that is one of the problem. many are hoarding hdb for subletting (side income) resulting resale market is tight. resale hdb price skyrocketed.

all these shall be resolved if BTO can meet demand and clear current backlog

Isn't better to let people sublet rather than having the flat "empty"?




because ppl KPKB say a lot of ppl buy HDB but dont live inside causing price to inflat.

woman must marry a man then can buy a flat right (the single scheme is another issue, i talking the normal scheme)

if she choose to marry a foreigner, then the ang mo must do ns lor

do ns is a sign of committment

new citizens who dont show committment in doing ns, should not be given the fruit of the land

gahmen say if can afford to own pte means no need for 'subsidised housing'. but those on 'subsidised housing' can allow to own pte and hdb. so technically, those requiring 'subsidy' can own more properties than those who are dun qualify for 'subsidy'. what a great system we have. it's a wonder why kbw still scratching his head as to why demand for hdb is so high......

yeah la all because HDB becomes a poltiical tool for the ruling party to sweeten the deal for the majority voters that they can have their cheap housing, they can have their capital gain, they can have their rental income all packaged into this HDB flat.

so HDB voters shouldn't blame HDB and pap now.  they got what they wanted.  if  their kids suffer in future, no choice, it is their own doing.  you can't expect HDB flat to be cheap if it can become your home, become your investment, and become your source of rental income.

yeah this is always the argument.  when folks clamor for ns for women, the women will say giving birth is their national service.
 

then i ask, so those ladies that cannot conceive or choose not to have children, should they be enlisted into national service by age 35 ?

some from the former group may have earned the good life on their own merit but there are many from the latter group that earns it from relying on govt subsidies.  that's where the bone of contention is coming from

I mean, if you're someone who travels a lot and quite often not at home, then like that how? They cannot suka suka say you not living at your house just because you happen to not be in it what.



 

There are tell tale signs that you live or do not live there. 
 

Eg...personal belonging...eg...your toothbrush...slippers...towels eg.
 

I heard that they also go and bio your flat regularly...see if you are there or not. 
 

Likewise...you can tell a rental car from a owner car....eg...decals (carpark...season parking)...small little custom stuff like a aftermarket mirror...some prayers stuff eg...

that's why  the first generation of HDB policy was mostly right......buy at cost, sell back at cost....no renting out etc.

hdb is your retirement tool > ie: rent out rooms, passive income

hdb is your asset enhancement > ie: downgrade or re-mortgage to cash out

hdb is your cpf > since cpf OA is near kosong after you paid up

hdb is $$$$$ tree
 




that's why  the first generation of HDB policy was mostly right......buy at cost, sell back at cost....no renting out etc.
 

now they liberalise here and there until the scheme lost track of its original intent and effectiveness.

yeah that's probably the first step.  as to whether to allow hdb sale in open market, it all depends on what objective they want to achieve.
 

if its most important objective is "affordable housing" then this golden goose should be slayed as well.

Die die also must keep especially if u have a good location unit.
 

But correct me if I'm wrong. I saw an article lately whereby they are looking ay the option of no leasing out for new bto.

Very confusing.

SINGAPORE: Former Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew said public housing has to keep up with the rising aspirations of Singaporeans and that the facilities and design of older estates should also not fall behind newer ones. 

Mr Lee was speaking at a tree planting event at Havelock View on Sunday.
 

Many residents of Havelock View turned up to welcome Mr Lee Kuan Yew who was there as part of the Tree Planting day celebrations.
 

Mr Lee said he had taken a special interest in greening Singapore and for which the National Parks Board was set up.
 

He added that the city's greenery differentiates Singapore.
 

"I started this campaign 50 years ago in the 1960s, I saw Hong Kong - concrete and tarmac, no trees, no grass, nothing. I decided we will not be like that. We became different, trees everywhere, opens spaces with grass, children's playground and a clean and safe environment," Mr Lee said.
 

Beyond green spaces, public housing in Singapore has also been transformed over the last 40 to 50 years.
 

Mr Lee said the standard of living has improved and public housing must keep up with rising aspirations.
 

Older estates have benefited from a range of programmes such as the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) and the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP).
 

"Everybody owns their own homes and the value of their homes go up as development takes place. Some are unwise enough to sell their homes, thinking they can buy another one, they then find they can't and have to rent a flat.
 

"But those who held on to their homes, I've seen their property values going up, five times, 10 times, 15 times, 20 times. This was the plan which we had from the very beginning, to give everybody a home at cost or below cost and as development takes place, everybody gets a lift, all boats rise as the tide rises. 
 

"We are investing to bring it up to date and you pay a token sum, the government carries the rest and HDB has been doing a fine job to give you an environment that you have today," Mr Lee shared.
 

But he said however nice the buildings may be, forging neighbourliness is also important.
 

"If neighbours don't cooperate to keep a bond of ownership of the place, it will not succeed."
 

And where development is concerned, residents of Havelock View have given the thumbs up, based on recent survey results conducted by HDB between July and August this year.
 

Of the over 250 households surveyed, nine in 10 said they were satisfied with the precinct's facilities, such as the elderly wellness station and playground. About eight in 10 were also satisfied with the overall flat design and features.
 

The seven block of flats - blocks 52 to 58 Havelock Road - completed in December last year were built as replacement flats for some residents in Zion Road - of blocks 88 to 92 - under the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS).

So overzealous in repossessing flats? Good lah, at least they are trying to send a clear signal to starve off official demand due to the want to collect rent. However, one wonders whether the supply of HDB itself could be related. not enough flats mah.

I won't be surprise, if the actual demand of the HDB is not really there. What I can see now, is many bought second mass market condos and rent out the HDBs. The number of HDB rentals have actual shot-up. So the real danger, if FTs have move back to home town with the recent changes in policies any trigger an over supply. Of cause, we won't be seeing this happening so soon. The filtering down effect may takes 2 -4 years. So by the time, one may start to realize the difficulties of renting out. This will in turn affect those , who have been depending HDB rental income to repay the private property's bank loans. Just dare not imaging, how many will get into trouble.

I don't get the asset appreciation thing actually. Even if the value of your flat goes up, you can't cash out what, since that leaves you with no place to stay, unless you want to spend all the profits on yet another inflated property.
 

If like that then LPPL right?
 

Why can't people just buy one house and stay in it forever, or at least until they need another one (due to kids or etc)? Really damn greedy leh.

The bank will have no way to take back one's HDB. But they have the right to trigger margin calls and take back the private property, if one can no longer able to sustain the loans. The day will come. But no one knows, went. But the new sustaining of property prices comes from the 6.9mil magic word.

The way to benefit from this appreciating asset is to cash out and live in other countries. This has work so well for some PR from the north who decides to retire back to their own country.
