need to have a will in place. If no will, state law applies.
 
If yes, he's entitled to the inheritance.
 
If he already owns another HDB flat, he must sell either one. He keeps the sale proceeds.
 
Correct?

Of course, cannot own more than one. Otherwise, many "rich" people liao - in the sense that many will just rent out to collect rental, and not enough used units to recycle back to open market.

from the link by Tommisan, if they already own a flat and the decease did not specify the proceed, just the flat in her will, mean the boy friend cannot qualify to inherit the flat?

but first must understand if the flat is joint tenancy or tenancy-in-common.
 
Joint Tenancy
A joint-tenancy is a form of ownership where all co-owners have an equal interest in the flat, regardless of the individual owner's contribution to buy the flat.In joint-tenancy, there is a right of survivorship. This means that upon the  death of a joint-tenant, his/her interest in the flat will automatically be passed to the remaining co-owner(s), regardless of whether the deceased joint-tenant has left behind a Will.Example: Mr. A, Mrs. B (wife) and Mr. C (son) own an HDB flat as joint tenants. In the event of Mr. A’s death, the ownership of the flat will automatically be passed to Mrs. B and Mr. C.Mrs. B & Mr. C will have to continue to service the monthly loan instalment unless the outstanding loan is paid up by the mortgage insurance arising from late joint-tenant's death.
Back to top
 
Tenancy-in-Common
Tenancy-in-common is a form of ownership where each co-owner holds a separate and definite share in the flat. However, all the co-owners are entitled to live in the whole flat regardless of their share in the property.There is no right of survivorship in tenancy-in-common. The deceased's interest in the flat does not pass on automatically to the remaining co-owner(s). Upon the  death of a tenant-in-common, the deceased's interest in the flat will be distributed according to his Will (if any) or according to the provisions of the Intestate Succession Act. The HDB's policies are based on similar lines, regardless of whether the flat is held under tenancy-in-common or joint-tenancy.

WLL.....hdb 'owners' are in fact a lessee. So if your tenant kaputz, does that mean they can suka suka pass your property to anyone they like?

not correct. even if a person is alive, there are restrictions/laws governing who can acquire a hdb flat.
 
doesn't mean a will so is powderful that it can override the an act of parliament.

of course the inheritator must still meet the requirements of physical occupation of HDB flat, failing which, he/she MUST sell it. Proceeds he/she keeps, but he/she cannot own it.  Just like those who owns HDB flat, but parents willed the flat over = cannot own both, MUST sell one.

The law never prohibits it leh.
 
But, it may be an interesting case if it is brought up to court when family members fought over it.

Can. My uncle's will state that his flat will go to his girlfriend. When he passed away she had to sell it but can keep the proceeds since she is not eligible to own the flat.

The will have to be first legally binding right? If no legal endorse won't count?
