Just checked my hdb loan statement.

Loan amount=103 5000

Loan tenure=25 yrs

montly payment=478

IP payment=90
 

Is the montly payment inclusive of hdb interest? Total payment after 25 yrs is 144000 estimated.

Why am i still being charged IP of 90 over dollars a month which was initially 100 over dollars a month?

My loan is 103 000 but will pay total ~144000 dollars and still need to pay IP monthly. Is this interest upon interest?

I am really dumbfounded. Any gurus can explain!

Interest for Hdb loans are based on monthly res. yes you are also paying interests monthly, but he interest will lower monthly too after payment. Hdb loan is 0.1% above CPR rates FYI

the way i look at it, very unlikely.
 

eg, you bought $200k flat with $100k CPF. after 10 years, your accrued interest on your CPF is eg. $40k.
 

so est you gotta put back $140k into your CPF a/c after the sale is completed.
 

however, i wud confidently say you wud not be selling your flat for lesser than $250k after 10 years ?
 

so in the end you might still make $10k or more !!
 

ppl only have problem if they otang money outside other than serving their housing loans.

No, what I mean is 144000 is your final amount you will paying for the loan, inclusive of interests. 
 

Best is you log into HDB web site with your Singpass and look at your financial status.

I tot i was paying $478/month inclusive of all interest.cb all-in-all i will be paying $144000 (accumulative monthly payment) + $36000 (downpayment) plus the IP payment of roughly $100 dollars/month for 25 yrs.

Was never told of the IP factor when i signed the agreement, they just state monthly payment is 478. Maybe thats y some pple get into trouble thinking they can cover the monthly instalments but fail to check on the IP monthly payment. And i am sure the amount will snowballed!

sort of ... bought my 3rm in 2005 for $178k ... used $163k CPF , took a $15k loan only.
 

now 7 years later, my accrued CPF int is $22k only but the resale price of my flat is about double what i paid !
 

so in my case, if i sell, i will have no problem putting back into my CPF and have some spare cash on hand ... but i have no intention to sell.

Hi guys, after paying for more than 10 years of HDB loans, I was one day asked by a friend from overseas, why are we paying so much for our public housing?
 

Can anyone kindly enlighten why we are charged annual interest for our housing loan when we have in fact borrowed the loan only one time? The total amount in interest repaid at the end of the mortgage term works out to be quite a hefty sum in comparison to the loan which we had borrowed. 
 

E.g. If I took a loan of $300K from HDB with a 2.6% annual interest, it works out to be $7800. Currently the loan is calculated on a per annum basis which means its approx interest is $7800(yearly depreciation)/12months=$650per month. 
 

The question is did I borrow that amount of $300K(yearly depreciation) from HDB every year for the next 30 years? If not then why are they charging me in this way for the next 30 years? That interest sum will eventually work out to be approx $7800(yearly depreciation)x30year=$234K which is about 78% interest in total. 
 

If so, then how can public housing be called "affordable"? If HDB claims that they are just following the commercial banks which are doing the same, then isn't there a conflict of interests, should HDB be working after profits like the banks OR should they be keeping public housing affordable for the citizens?
 

But if the calculation is 2.6% interest on $300K but over 30 years, that works out to be $7800/360months=$21.67per month. Which means I took a one time loan with interest but 30years to repay that loan with interest and NOT 30 times that loan for the next 30 years. To me, this is jutisfiable and affordable.
 

Anyone care to shed light on the topic?

where your friend come from?     Europe ? 
 

Buy real estate is never cheap. Interest incurred will seem high regardless if it a sg hdb, sg pte or a oversea pte. At least for sg hdb, interest is "fixed", so mthly instalment is predictable. 
 

It seem foolish to take hdb loan at 2.6% than 1.1% from the bank.. Tell that to the flat owner on bank loan in 2006 there abt.. they will tell you why.. 
 

The way interest is computed has little different from country to country.. Only thing is that sg has force saving,cpf that is "kind" of dedicate to paying off the mortgage.

You calculation is based on car loan or rule 78 calculation which is not correct.
 

If you took a loan of 300k from HDB at 2.6% over 30 years, 
 

The total interest = $ 132,367. 
 

Total Payment (Loan Amount + Total Interest) = $ 432,367   
 

Total Payment Spent on Interest : 31%
 

Monthly installment = $1201
 

The interest per annual is reducing when you are paying off the loan amount / principal amount. It's not fixed at $7800 yearly

Then i soon realise i am only paying half of the principle the rest goes to interest, like $300 goes to interest per month. So me and wife made decision to pay $1800 pm. now i loan free and loooking to buy second property.

The HDB is a real asset ow since the rental of $2400 will help finance my second property.

You know that's illegal right, renting your HDB out while you stay in a private property?
 

Also, if the money stayed in CPF, and you borrowed using HDB's subsidised loan rates, your net interest cost per month is really just 0.1%... in fact you could even lose money if some of your OA money qualifies for extra 1% interest.

I cannot agree with this. Even though the calculation is based on the depreciating principle amount every year, did we borrow the loan 1 time or 30 times? Cos' to me the total amount from the interest works our pretty high for what the gov claimed is affordable for its citizens.
 

Even the new HDB prices are ridculous. HDB peg their sell price to the market while the market also peg their price against the new launches...which makes even the new HDB flats out of reach for many in the low income or newly weds...why? Even the rising costs of building materials would not have costed the new HDB flats to have appreciated to such levels. 
 

Furthermore, we are not even owners...just "leasee" status. This ,to me, is not public housing.

Correct me if I'm wrong, isn't the IP factor the compound interest which is calculated by 
 

2.6% / 12 mths = 0.2167% per mth interest
 

0.2167% per mth interest X balance loan amount = IP 2.6 (appear in your HDB statement)
 

I loan around 400k, by end of 30 yrs, the total I pay will be $591840, exclude COV and downpayment...

You are confused with the interest rate. The loan is set upon a specific interest rate in PER ANNUM basis, not per tenure.

D/P                      =$34 000

Loan amount         =$103 000

Monthly (25 yrs)    =$478

IP                        =$90 (previously was 100++)
 

So my total monthly installment for 25 yrs will be $143 400

And i have been paying IP of average $90 for 25 yrs=$27000

So beside the accumulated interest of $143 000-$103000=$40 000

I still need to pay $27000 of IP.

And one MIW says its cheap....1000 salary can buy 3 room flat but the loan repayment will be siao liao

FYI, If owner has stayed the 5 years (used to be only 3 years) Minimum Occupation Period, then it is legal to purchase a 2nd private property and rent out their HDB.



 

In addition to this, an agent told me I need to have 60k combined in OA and SA before purchasing the 2nd private property, is this true?

Hmm...you're right...used to be flat out illegal, but now it is subject to approval.
 
 

http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10325p.nsf/w/...es?OpenDocument

Subletting the HDB Flat Flat owner(s) and their families must continue to stay in their  HDB flats after buying private residential properties. However,  exception is made for those who have obtained prior approval from HDB to  sublet their flats under the Subletting of Flat policy.

your friend got it wrong liao. 
 

do note, if we are staying in a property, the Property will be taxed at 4%. but loan out, it will be taxed at 10%.
 

so on first approval, say in June, they will send you the letter to collect the 6% for remainder of the year starting from when you loan out the flat.
 

when your tenure ended and you decide to cancel and move back to the house, say in June next year, they will re-imburse you back the amount from time you stay back in.
 

nothing to get angry, it is a benefit that is given to those staying in the property to pay lesser tax, but if you loan out, you pay more tax.

Bro, I think if you add all the IP from donkey years ago, it will total up to around 40k, the IP that you have been paying is included into the total monthly installment, you will not be forking out additional $27,000 for IP.

so cheap meh...i loaded 95K from HDB for 30 years and after 7 years of payment, i still otang then 87++ K....
 

Let be known that HDM charged interest base on cycle.....
 

If i remember correctly.......
 

1st 5 years......40-60...ie every 100 paid, 40% is paying principle and 60% interest

6-10 years.......60-40...

10-15 years.......70-30 and etc
 

Thus, most ppl will loss out their majority of money paid to the interest in the 1st 5-10year..... they dont count like car loan where by they divided out equally base on numbers of months..... They impose high payment of interest in the 1st 5 and 10 years....

Yes bro...the total amount payble will range from 55 - 70% more on top of the principle borrowed. The long one drag the more you will be paying.... That i why i doubt when you say you borroed 103K and total replayment is only 144+++K...... The total payable to 103K with 25 years will be around 160K+-

that i know....but based on $103 000 loan i should be paying $344/month based on 0.0 interest.

Now i am paying $478/month (so i assume $134 is the interest charged)

But what about the Ip charge of $90?

your monthly instalment is $478 which is inclusive of $90 of interest.  I suppose your outstanding loan is now ~$41,538?
 

Meaning every month, when u pay $478, $90 goes towards paying the interest and the remaining $388 goes towards paying the mortgage loan.
 

E.g. On the 1st of Jan 2012, your o/s loan is $41,538. Interest for Jan 2012= (2.6% of $41,538)/12 = $90. U pay $478 for Jan's instalment.
 

On the 1st of Feb 2012, your o/s loan is $41,150 ($41,538 - $388). Interest for Feb 2012 = $89.16 and so on.

I don't think it's calculated this way leh, they have a formula to calculate the overall amount including all IP, then they charge the interest rate of 
 

(2.6% / 12) * balance loan = IP
 

Therefore your IP will decrease every month.
 

For the $478 you are paying is after all the formulas.

Correct as long as you fullfill your MOP of 5years you can rent out entire flat legally. Cause i had done that 4 yrs ago, got to seek approval from HDB and as long as you meet this MOP requirement 100% sure approve. I know cause i rented my flat out for a period of 5 years. 
 

Just to share previously i rented out my 5rm HBD at punggol at $1900 pm and then i rented a condo at East coast Area. I just top up $500 to stay at East Coast Condo. The rental at East Coast only $2400pm Then i got free parking for my car, Van and my Motorbike. So actually i just pay about $300 top up to stay at Condom. Minus Property tax of about $2000PA i still pay for about $400++.
 

Imagine paying extra $400++ to stay at condo.
 

The lesson here is never to sell ur HDB, cause it is a real asset which you can collect a decent rental. compare to a  condo. And the thing is that HDB is very easy to rent out. one advert on the news paper you will get many calls.
 
 

And for the Second property i think the minimum sum OA + SA must be about 60k before you can use your CPF to buy or for financing your second property.

So what i did was emptying my CPF for the first Property and over the years accumulate cash for the down on the second property.
 

So my ordinary account CPF now is almost $0. Special is in investment. Medisave is with the Government.
 

So like that my CPF becomes Liquid cash if i rent out my HDB. Dont have to wait till 65 to cash out. HaHAAAAAA
 

They try to lock me but cannot lock. Song boh!

I think it is 50% of the minimum sum. I also dunno why some of the younger couples insist on getting EC,condo or DBSS for their 1st property. When you take a loan of 500-700K, its almost impossible to finish paying off ppty early using just your CPF contributions.
 

I aspire to be like Song Song! Have 2 ppty.... rent 1 out!

As for interest payment on HDB home. I have only one advise. Try to pay off your first or main property asap. Some financial Guru will tell you "why pay off, you can use the money to invest make more than the interest you are paying" Coming from working at a bank previously, you can tell them to ^&*% off.
 

Tell them dont talk c--k, when s--t happens s--t really happens. I had seen so many sob storys when coming to investment.
 

Share with you one.

Got this friend Downgrade from EA to 4 room. Got the cash spend like crazy, change car, buy many new thing in his home. Then invest the rest of the $$$ on shares, currency and one magically investment called landbanking. 
 

Last yr he tried to borrow $$$$ from me. Told me his $$$ almost gone the wife took the rest and is leaving him. 
 

When you have $$$ dont know wat to do that is a very dangerous thing. Cause marriage will fail and family will break.
 

To me, the most essential thing i can provide is a roof over our heads for my family. Knowing that if one day i died prematurely they still got shelter, got a place to call home. Secondly by paying off your main roof, it gives me the courage to go out of my comfort zone and try new things or start new biz. Cause i know if i fail which might happen, i can just start all over again without causing too much of problems for my family.
 

There are many advantages in paying off your HDB asap. Too long to list.
 

Now i am starting anew again like when i first bought my HDB 10 years ago when i was 25. Now getting second property is like my engine going to start again.

Time to chiong again. 
 

Chiong arhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
 

My dream is that by 60 i will have about 3 property in Singapore All rented out. And then i go phuket or some vietnam beach sell beer by the beach and talk to plp and watching clouds fly by.

Honestly, you have no business getting a second property if you 1st one is not all paid up. If you do that, you are over-leveraging. If you get lucky, you will become rich. If you lose your day job, you WILL be bankrupt. Slow and steady my friend.

But it is quite diff to accumulate cash for downpayment of 2nd property after paying in full for HDB. To pay in full for HDB at age 30+, one must pay part in cash on top of CPF?
 

Buy pte at least need to have $230K for 1m condo and stamp duties.

??

If you worry about 230K and stamp duty and duties, then you probably dun have what it takes to get a 1M ppty. Aim a bit lower, get a 900K one? Buy what you can afford and be contented. =)
 

Anyway, to your qn,
 

If you are able to pay off your 1st ppty quickly, I would assume u and your wife will be at the limit of CPF contribution. so thats 2k a month ... If you count 13 month, thats 26K in one year in just ordinary account CPF contribution.
 

As for cash, it depends on yourself. I know people who earn around 5K but wears Rolex, have fine dining, go for holidays,buy branded goods, frink >100 a bottle wine and drive big cars and have little cash left every month. I also know poeple who earn around 4k managing to save almost 100k by his early 30s. BEing able to earn a lot help, but being able to control your spending also helps.
 

The problem with people who dun earn a lot is they want everything but cant afford everything so when they have to choose,  they go for the low hanging fruits. A rolex watch and a Burberry jacket is easier to get than a condo. You must be discipline and tong for the 2nd ppty. Once you have that, the rental income will buy you a few rolexes a year. 
 

Of course, dun torture yourself la.. Get a Seiko instead of Rolex, drive a small car, go Japan or Korea instead of a round trip of Europe...... etc... spend wisely.

Actually i am paying about $250 a month to service the HDB loan and I can actually pay up the balance with whats in my CPF but they will deplete my 60k required for the 2nd property.

If you worry about 230K and stamp duty and duties, then you probably dun have what it takes to get a 1M ppty. Aim a bit lower, get a 900K one? Buy what you can afford and be contented. =)
 

Anyway, to your qn,
 

If you are able to pay off your 1st ppty quickly, I would assume u and your wife will be at the limit of CPF contribution. so thats 2k a month ... If you count 13 month, thats 26K in one year in just ordinary account CPF contribution.
 

As for cash, it depends on yourself. I know people who earn around 5K but wears Rolex, have fine dining, go for holidays,buy branded goods, frink >100 a bottle wine and drive big cars and have little cash left every month. I also know poeple who earn around 4k managing to save almost 100k by his early 30s. BEing able to earn a lot help, but being able to control your spending also helps.
 

The problem with people who dun earn a lot is they want everything but cant afford everything so when they have to choose,  they go for the low hanging fruits. A rolex watch and a Burberry jacket is easier to get than a condo. You must be discipline and tong for the 2nd ppty. Once you have that, the rental income will buy you a few rolexes a year. 
 

Of course, dun torture yourself la.. Get a Seiko instead of Rolex, drive a small car, go Japan or Korea instead of a round trip of Europe...... etc... spend wisely.



 

Easily done. I'm 32, hit $100K cash last month. In this day and age, it's no big deal. So, yes, those who can't even do that, really ought to shoot themselves over indulging in luxuries they don't deserve to have.

I guess it really depends on one's monthly income. If earns $2K, how to accumulate $100K by 32. Hardly possible less hit jackpot.
 

say if you got $400K savings (magic number) and outstanding hdb loan is $100K, will you use $100K cash to pay it up?

Actually i am paying about $250 a month to service the HDB loan and I can actually pay up the balance with whats in my CPF but they will deplete my 60k required for the 2nd property.



 
 

Dude, $ in left hand vs right hand issue. Either way the loan needs to be paid and you can use CPF to pay for your 2nd ppty loan after the 1st one is paid. By the way, the 60-70K includes your special account ...etc... So either way also you'll have to wait to accumulate the same amount of CPF.
 
 

Ok we are venturing into a territory where I am not an expert in, so sexperts like SongSong please chime in. If I understand correctly, you are required to top-up your CPF account additional deductions for your property that exceeds the full value of your ppty. What this means is. If your ppty cost 500K, you took 350k loan. But over the 20 years of payment, you accrued 200K interest paids. So total CPF used is 550K. So you have to return 50K.
 

What has this got to do with you? The earlier u pay up, the less interest you pay.

True ... but a person with 2K income should not be think about a 2nd ppty ....

Always use your tax contribution  sorry CPF when ever possible.

I just went down to have a chat with the officer at HDB. The reply:"Its like that one...that's how the calculation is done." I ask her if she has ever looked at how the calculation was done and if she feels its justified for public housing to incur so high interest, she was dumbfounded for a moment realizing what I had put forth was logically sound. In the end the HDB officer was left with questions herself.
 

So is HDB a commercial entity like commercial banks which are publicly listed and for profit OR is HDB a government agency set up to provide affordable public housing to the citizens? If it's formula works like commercial ones, which is for profit, then here lies a serious issue of the conflict of interests to it's citizens.
 

When I looked at my annual HDB statement, I am extremely upset to see almost half of what is deducted from my CPF goes into their charged interest. My hard earn money which could be used to give my family better support in education and medical are being drain away by a stupid formula, and I don't need to guess where those money ends up eventually...fat paychecks for the elite group of people given the mandate to run our country....bloody hell.
 

We never really question the protocols, simply accepted them as norms. If we don't bother to find out and question then we will be taken for a ride at every junction in life.

As for interest payment on HDB home. I have only one advise. Try to pay off your first or main property asap. Some financial Guru will tell you "why pay off, you can use the money to invest make more than the interest you are paying" Coming from working at a bank previously, you can tell them to ^&*% off.
 

Tell them dont talk c--k, when s--t happens s--t really happens. I had seen so many sob storys when coming to investment.
 

Share with you one.

Got this friend Downgrade from EA to 4 room. Got the cash spend like crazy, change car, buy many new thing in his home. Then invest the rest of the $$$ on shares, currency and one magically investment called landbanking. 
 

Last yr he tried to borrow $$$$ from me. Told me his $$$ almost gone the wife took the rest and is leaving him. 
 

When you have $$$ dont know wat to do that is a very dangerous thing. Cause marriage will fail and family will break.
 

To me, the most essential thing i can provide is a roof over our heads for my family. Knowing that if one day i died prematurely they still got shelter, got a place to call home. Secondly by paying off your main roof, it gives me the courage to go out of my comfort zone and try new things or start new biz. Cause i know if i fail which might happen, i can just start all over again without causing too much of problems for my family.
 

There are many advantages in paying off your HDB asap. Too long to list.
 

Now i am starting anew again like when i first bought my HDB 10 years ago when i was 25. Now getting second property is like my engine going to start again.

Time to chiong again. 
 

Chiong arhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
 

My dream is that by 60 i will have about 3 property in Singapore All rented out. And then i go phuket or some vietnam beach sell beer by the beach and talk to plp and watching clouds fly by.

HDB "subsidised" housing loan interest rates look high only because we are living in a "zero interest rate" era, so 2.6% looks insane.
 

But when you look at the CPF system as a whole, the reason why housing loan has to be 2.6% is because the OA interest rate is 2.5%. From what I understand, bulk of CPF OA is used to fund housing loans, so the subsidised rate is locked into OA interest rates. Since OA interest rate has a "bottom" at 2.5%, "subsidised" housing loan rates cannot go much lower either, or the government will have to look for money elsewhere to actually subsidise the loan. Either that, or OA has to go closer to market rates, like 0.5%...that will seriously mess up a lot of retirement plans.
 

In my humble opinion, and I have been wrong for at least 4 years, normal housing loan rates ought to be closer to 5%, at the very least, probably closer to 7%.
 

I have trouble seeing how that can happen in the short term, as Europe Japan US are all in trouble that can only be solved with lower interest rates... even booming Australia is cutting interest rates.

But I have no doubt it will happen, and when it does, a lot of people will be caught with their pants down. 
 

As a rough gauge, imagine you have a 500k loan. If interest rates go up by 3%, you will need to pay $15k more every year, just in interest payments. For most people, the only way to survive that is to sell, and that will happen at a time when everyone is rushing for the exits.
 

The nightmare scenario probably will not happen in the next 1 or 2 years. But most housing loans stretch on for 30 years. Dont bet on sh.it not happening for that long.
 

So, long story short, HDB subsidised rates of 2.6% will look dirt cheap when the financial market returns to normality... some day.

Been seeing on some forums that there's a possibility of CPF increasing it's interest rate to 3%. Then that also means that the hdb loan interest rate is also going up cuz it's pegged to the CPF rate. Think maybe better to go with home loan from bank with SIBOR rate.

Different ppl, different cut. But your example of your friend is wrong la, he is literally blowing money away.
 

Also in investment, if you don't know how to invest, it is gambling.... If want to invest, learn how to do it first before embarking on it.

Actually the point is flats are too expensive, the loan rates are fine.
 

Imagine I say borrow from you 300k and I repay you 1.2k monthly over a period of 30years, you cannot demand early repayment.... Would you lend the money?

Just checked my hdb loan statement.

Loan amount=103 5000

Loan tenure=25 yrs

montly payment=478

IP payment=90
 

Is the montly payment inclusive of hdb interest? Total payment after 25 yrs is 144000 estimated.

Why am i still being charged IP of 90 over dollars a month which was initially 100 over dollars a month?

My loan is 103 000 but will pay total ~144000 dollars and still need to pay IP monthly. Is this interest upon interest?

I am really dumbfounded. Any gurus can explain!



 

Why you take loan? Just pay in full lah

bro i really donno! 

I took a loan donkey yrs ago and have been paying such!

Unit price              =$137500

D/P                      =$34 000

Loan amount         =$103 000

Monthly (25 yrs)    =$478

IP                        =$90 (previously was 100++)
 

So my total monthly installment for 25 yrs will be $143 400

And i have been paying IP of average $90 for 25 yrs=$27000

So beside the accumulated interest of $143 000-$103000=$40 000

I still need to pay $27000 of IP.

And one MIW says its cheap....1000 salary can buy 3 room flat but the loan repayment will be siao liao 



 

working on your figures,the IP is actually part of your installment but they deduct it seperately.

assuming donkey years ago HDB interest rate is also 2.6%/annum,then your monthly installment should be $566.50 and not $478.

can i seek advice on where will be a good place to park my OA money other than Unit Trust in banks? i am looking for mostly capital guaranteed, or at least with the least sales charge/admin fees..
 
even though banks' website states Fixed D, bonds etc, they are not available to me. Quoted from a O**C bank staff, "We only offer Treasury bonds to our premier customers. I would recommend you to invest in UT"

	Many CPF investors get their fingers burnt

 
Monday, Jun 15, 2015
Janice Heng
The Straits Times



MOST investors who use Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings to invest would have been better off leaving their money in their Ordinary Accounts, according to the CPF Investment Scheme's (CPFIS) annual profit and loss report.
This is despite the good performance of investment funds included in the scheme.
In the financial year ended Sept 30 last year, 902,300 investors sold their CPFIS investments.
Only 15 per cent of them made a profit larger than the guaranteed annual 2.5 per cent interest rate for Ordinary Account savings. Another 45 per cent made profits of up to 2.5 per cent. The remaining 40 per cent made a loss.
Under the scheme, members can invest in CPFIS-included funds such as approved unit trusts and equity funds, as well as other investment products such as stocks and shares.
The CPFIS-included funds themselves have performed well.
They posted an average return of 5.17 per cent in the first three months of this year, according to a report by research firm Lipper last month.
The funds have grown by about 29 per cent over the past three years. But individual investors may perform poorly as a result of investing in riskier instruments instead of CPFIS-included funds, said experts.
The gap could reflect a difference in financial knowledge, investment skills and discipline, said Mr Lance Tay, chief executive officer of Tokio Marine Life Insurance Singapore.
"This can be improved with increased financial literacy and discipline, or with guidance from financial advisers," he added.
Barclays senior economist Leong Wai Ho noted that stocks and shares were subject to many more market fluctuations.
"It's better that people stick to professionally guided products like approved funds," he said. "That's more appropriate for something that's supposed to be a person's store of value, their life savings."
Earlier this year, Institute of Policy Studies research fellow Christopher Gee argued that the default risk-return balance on CPF savings is good enough for most members.
"A lack of adequate financial literacy among CPF members and potential retirees may result in sub-optimal decision-making," he noted.
On the one hand, fewer CPFIS investors are making losses now compared with the past decade. From 2004 to 2013, 47 per cent of them incurred realised losses, more than the 40 per cent who made a loss last year.
On the other hand, more investors used to earn profits above the 2.5 per cent Ordinary Account interest rate.
From 2004 to 2013, 18 per cent of investors did better, compared with 15 per cent in the last financial year. More than 25 per cent did from 1993 to 2004.

HDB loan is 2.6%. Unless you are sure u can get more than 2.6% from your CPF investment, otherwise i think you should pay off as much as possible to reduce the interest amount. Further i would also advise you to make partial redemption as often as u could to lessen the loan amount and hence lesser the interest. 2.6% is quite high if u ask me. 
just my opinion based on what i did with 2 partial redemptions to pay off in less than 5 years. I had saved several thousands of interests if i had stuck to 30 years.

You want to "lock" your money in OA for short term right?
Unit trust is for long term. Short term will surely lose money... the commission.
Maybe you can buy some blue chip stock.
Sell after HDB clear your OA.
Of course, there is risk of gain/loss as the stock price is more volatile.
 
This is what I think you can do. Correct me if I am wrong.

I guess he is trying to keep a 12 months buffer for the bad time.
 
If his monthly payment is $1k, he might want to park $12k some where else first.
2.6% of $12k is not much if it gives us peace of mind.

use the "available" sum for investment in OA to whack blue chip like bank stock .... (ie: DBS, UOB, OCBC)
then after OA wipe clean clean for BTO
sell the stock and the money shall be returned to OA
must pick the right stock hor ... can also consider SPH, Singtel, Starhub, M1, etc ... that is stable and don't jump up/down like roller coaster
 

as my BTO will be ready next year, i have heard ppl saying that one should park some CPF money elsewhere before HDB wipes out my OA and I have to topup cash for the monthly installment..
 
can i seek advice on where will be a good place to park my OA money other than Unit Trust in banks? i am looking for mostly capital guaranteed, or at least with the least sales charge/admin fees..
 
even though banks' website states Fixed D, bonds etc, they are not available to me. Quoted from a O**C bank staff, "We only offer Treasury bonds to our premier customers. I would recommend you to invest in UT"  
 
TIA!

I guess he is trying to keep a 12 months buffer for the bad time.
 
If his monthly payment is $1k, he might want to park $12k some where else first.
2.6% of $12k is not much if it gives us peace of mind.

 
i dont quite understand how the 12 months buffer work? u mean standby a reserve amount of 12k for 12 months so that he can still pay off the loan in the event of unemployment?

Lots of rich ppl here in MCF. But ignore them. Paying ur monthly bill for a roof over ur head is more important.
I used to do that too when I first got my flat. I park $10k of CPF with some insurance company. After they wipe out my OA, cancel the policy and the money returned to my OA. It helps tide me over for a year or so. My pay then was not very high, only $2k/mth. I am not sure which company offers the lowest admin fee, speak to the various agents. They know what to do one.

doesn't make any difference whether you redeem the loan early or let it run until the end 'cos recurring interest is charged even when redeemed.
 
Importantly, is to borrow the least at the shortest repayment period if your financial situation allows.
 

 
 
HDB loan is 2.6%. Unless you are sure u can get more than 2.6% from your CPF investment, otherwise i think you should pay off as much as possible to reduce the interest amount. Further i would also advise you to make partial redemption as often as u could to lessen the loan amount and hence lesser the interest. 2.6% is quite high if u ask me. 
just my opinion based on what i did with 2 partial redemptions to pay off in less than 5 years. I had saved several thousands of interests if i had stuck to 30 years.

when HDB wipes out my OA for payment (which they will do) before calculating my loan, i will only be left with my monthly cpf contribution from my salary. my contribution isnt enough to pay for the monthly installment, which was previously estimated as 1.5k. hence i will have to top up cash.
 
with the buffer, i will returned my 'parked' money back to my OA afterwards to make sure my OA has sufficient amount for the full monthly deduction.
 
this is what i understand of the situation that will happen.
 
please correct me if im wrong

Yea having some buffer is important especially for the sole breadwinners, having enough for 12 months payment in your OA is safe enough. thats why its not advisable to buy house too expensive, to the point where use both husband wife cpf still need to come out cash, touch wood, either 1 lose job, dont know how long can find new one

There is a big big difference...
 
Best is to MINIMISE payment - and then make lumpsum when you feel ready. 
 
Can anytime (basically) top up your payments - but you cannot reduce your payments at your convenience.

My worry is when reaching 55, all the money in OA account will be tranfered to RA account. Then how to make the remainding loan payment, if it is still outstanding?

Not true for all. Some buy their first BTO at 30+, maybe due to late marriage.

assuming buyer is 30 years old ... must fully paid by 45 ...
can pay lump sum every year with cash or cpf if monthly deduction from cpf is lower than contribution
from 45 to 55 cpf start accumulate liao ... don't forget there is still CPF MS

yes - why not ... the earliest fully paid the best ... the more you down/pay the less you take loan (lesser interest or shorter loan period)
 
no - if you worry you lose job ... better have a buffer in OA like $12K (ie: $1K per month to service loan) so that even lose job for 12 months no need to pay cash to service loan

for my dad's case, he has just turned 55 and still has outstanding HDB loan to clear monthly.
 
what cpf advised was so long as the half the minimum sum amount is in the account (forgot which accounts combined), the rest can be still used to deduct ur monthly installments.. so even though my dad has RA, he has balance amount for the installments plus he is still contributing.. so no issue for him at the moment.

I tot is because if we pay up fully, we won't be covered under the mortage insurance. Is that also another reason why some opt not to pay in full ?

Agree...pay faster, lesser interest
 
It really depends on 
a) What other resources you have if something "goes wrong" 
b) How secure is your income stream
 
For me - I don't have anything at all to fall back on, if cannot work = no money, so I minimise payment and then when / if ready will make a lump sum...

For my personal situation - 
 
got PR at age 26, first year is 6% of salary, year two is (was) 9% then 12% - only in fourth year is it full contribution. 
Then summore during that period I was on commission sales - my commission was not CPFable at the time, 
Wifey - only started work in SG at age 26.... so both our accounts quite minimal when buy....
 
right now, make payments fully from one account - let the other build up (with a view to investment property down the track)

If I am not wrong, we paid the premium when we signed up the HDB loan.
No return of premium if we settle the loan early.

For HDB, no need buffer lah.  Juz pay up as fast as possible to reduce interest charge.
 
If really so suay, talk to HDB loh.
 
Previously, whenever i do partial redemption, i will only keep 1 month installment in OA for next installment.

In short they just take 50% of the minimum sum from cpf to go to RA? The rest pledge with house.  
So don't have to worry about minimum sum but take note of any sudden change in policy of cpf and act accordingly.

CPF interest rates include an additional 1% interest paid on the first $60,000 of a member's combined balances (with up to $20,000 from the OA). I always keep my OA above 20k. No need to clear early unless want to get loan for next property.

As long as the unit is not sold, the interest will not be realised.  Even it is realised, it is still your $$$ what.
 
There is no real cash outflow from CPF OA unlike mortgage loan interest.

Depending on if u intend to sell and when u intend to sell.
 
If u intend to sell 10years later ur interest incur will be 26% more hence selling the flat will actually bring u lesser cash earned.

I took up HDB loan @ 2.6% interest because I do not want to worry much about fluctuating interest rate offered by banks.
 
Some of my colleagues chided me for being stupid as the bank loans are below 1% now while mine is at 2.6%.
I know that I am not smarter than the banks and they will earn back the money somehow.
 
I agreed with repaying the HDB loans with lump sums as often as possible.. I just started my 25 years repayment with 200K loan..
 
I managed to persuade my wife to get a BTO in West rather than EC or good locations as I do not know how to repay 700K in loans... 
 
Can anyone enlighten me on how banks can offer housing loans of interest rate below 1% or slightly above 1%?
It is really attractive that a lot of my friends took up bank loans instead.

i could not remember clearly it's the law that they cannot or they won't
but if it's commercial bank ... you miss your loan repayment few times ... sure kena penalty or kena repossess no mercy

First u need to understand why hdb loan is 2.6%
 
It is not because that is the correct calculation but rather it's because cpf interest rate cannot fall below 2.5%
 
And gahmen once say cannot be gahmen loan u money and yet u still earn from cpf interest. It doesn't make sense? Hence cpf will forever be peg to cpf interest plus 0.1%

It is not because that is the correct calculation but rather it's because cpf interest rate cannot fall below 2.5%
 
And gahmen once say cannot be gahmen loan u money and yet u still earn from cpf interest. It doesn't make sense? Hence cpf will forever be peg to cpf interest plus 0.1%
 
On of the few remaining good legacy left behind by hdb pioneer.

 
I understood this portion on why interest is 2.6%. Sometimes the banks come up with a lot of housing loans patterns that confuse and entice people.
 
Some has 10 years fixed interest rate... Good if I can pay in 10 years... I am a simple guy that is not savvy enough to beat the banks at its game..

Depending on if u intend to sell and when u intend to sell.
 
If u intend to sell 10years later ur interest incur will be 26% more hence selling the flat will actually bring u lesser cash earned.

 
Cashflow from sales of HDB is still the same.
 
Actual cash receipt will be reduced loh.

doesn't make any difference whether you redeem the loan early or let it run until the end 'cos recurring interest is charged even when redeemed.
 
Importantly, is to borrow the least at the shortest repayment period if your financial situation allows.
 
 

 
Huh? i thought no more interest once the loan is redeemed? hence when i make a partial redemption, the interest will be lesser since the outstanding amount is lesser??

Different due to the reduce in cash receipt in short u still loss. The only exception is when u are above 55 years old. 
U can do a simple calculation using 1mil for simple calculation and u will notice the difference is u sell at 10 years mark before 55 years old.

Bank is usually link to sibor or other interbanking rate mark up. Which is at near zero due to oversea reduce interest rate to very low mah.

i don't answer the part which bank is cheapest and how much savings and how could bank offer such a low rate
 
i will still take hdb loan because if i can't repay my loan due to whatever reason, no one can foreclosure my hdb
i could not remember clearly it's the law that they cannot or they won't
but if it's commercial bank ... you miss your loan repayment few times ... sure kena penalty or kena repossess no mercy
 
 

 
Agree if can take HDB loan, just take.... don't get sway by bank low interest rate for first few years..... after that.... they can raise the rates to 5% or 6% or 10%..... 
 
Not that HDB cannot chase you out.... it's that they usually won't cause it's political..... as a Stat Board, they cannot be seen at "bullying people"..... but downside is people take advantage.... but again..... they not afraid you don't pay..... sooner or later... still got to pay one.... here only MIW makan people..... people want to makan MIW.. like a ant wanna to swallow an elephant....

When I went to redeem my loan, the Hedge Dee Bee opicer told me no difference one. Actually, can just leave it as it is. But, I just clear off since got extra money in CPF and there's no plan to buy another property.
 
True enough, every year when I see my CPF statement, the accrued interest keep increasing. CPF treats your housing loan as if the "money" is still in your CPF account and is the interest you would have earned if you've not used it. Anyway, it's "your money" and at the end of the day...
 
But, am not sure if at time of withdrawal, you get back the accrued interest or deduct off the accrued interest and pay you the balance??? 
 
It's complicated sh1ts.

What I am curious - if make voluntary CPF contribution, does it pay back to the money you took for housing?

Why do you say that? Don't see much benefits of having outstanding HDB loans except unexpected situations, or you can beat the cpf returns via investing.
 
Paying off allows you to take a bigger loan for your second house etc under current CM

There is. Hard to explain here. Absolute value is somehow lower. 
Just think if u sell and everything remain the same you should get back same amount. Since after paying debt and cpf interest u should have same cash.
 
But if u take a longer loan and pay back slowly. Somehow u repay back to ur cpf and still get the same final amount in the cpf as when u pay in full. But your total cash back is lesser then when u take longer loan.
 
How can it be the same when your cpf remain unchange but cash portion is more if u take longer loan.

Why do you say that? Don't see much benefits of having outstanding HDB loans except unexpected situations, or you can beat the cpf returns via investing.

That is if u are buying a second house. 
U do know using cpf money to invest is not really a good point as one who take longer and larger loan can actually start investing early. And we know investing early usually have good head start unless of course u start when marketing is on obvious downward trend.
 
Please note I am not saying totally don't pay off. What I am saying if u are not doing anything special at the moment it's better to just let it run as the total different aren't large. However if some funny change going to be implemented or when u need to buy a second house yes pay it off.

Banks have been offering low interest rates for nearly 7 years. The interest rate usually comprised a (A) spread rate + (B) floating rate based on sibor, sor or board rate. Sibor/sor is usually 3 months. Board’s rate?  God knows.
 
(A) Is usually fixed or can vary after a period and fixed thereafter. (A) can be fixed between 0.6% to 1.5%, but usually about 0.75% or 0.85%.
 
(B) will vary from 0% to no limit. Currently it’s about 0.8%.
 
So if you take bank loan, you will be paying something like 0.85% (spread) + 0.8% (3M sibor) = 1.65%. This is much cheaper compared to HDB’ s interest rate of 2.6%. Gone are the days when interest rate was close to 1% as the rate has started creeping up this year.
 
Logically, bank loan is better, for the time being. Note that you are not only paying a lower rate, but the quantum of the loan is highest in the initial years of the loan and hence savings can be substantial.
 
To simplify it - assuming your loan is 200k and bank rate is 1.5%, you will pay interest of $3.000 instead of $5,200 on HDB loan. In the following year, the loan decreased to say 180k, your pay interest of $2,700 instead of $4,680. If interest rate remains low, can you imagine the interest savings?  If you don’t like paying interest, you can prepay the loan. But if you got money in CPF OA earning 2.5% why use CPF to settle a loan that is charging you 1.85%? If you have spare cash earning 0.05%, it makes sense to prepay the loan.
 
The only fear in taking bank loan is that the interest rate can rise sky high.  But if interest rate goes up, most probably FD/savings rate will also go up and CPF’s interest rate will also be adjusted upward and hence the HDB’s loan rate.  Come such scenario, HDB’s rate will definitely be lower than bank’s rate.  If you are on bank’s loan, be prepared to prepay the loan with available CPF and or cash.
 

 

I took up HDB loan @ 2.6% interest because I do not want to worry much about fluctuating interest rate offered by banks.
 
Some of my colleagues chided me for being stupid as the bank loans are below 1% now while mine is at 2.6%.
I know that I am not smarter than the banks and they will earn back the money somehow.
 
I agreed with repaying the HDB loans with lump sums as often as possible.. I just started my 25 years repayment with 200K loan..
 
I managed to persuade my wife to get a BTO in West rather than EC or good locations as I do not know how to repay 700K in loans... 
 
Can anyone enlighten me on how banks can offer housing loans of interest rate below 1% or slightly above 1%?
It is really attractive that a lot of my friends took up bank loans instead.

they based on the assumption that if you didn't take the loan from cpf, what would be the interest accrued.
 
so any profits will go back to make up the difference so that you will not be short changed for your retirement.
 
i think it's just a tool to ensure that people dun profit too much and anyhow spend their money which should be part of their retirement

drag until we can buy new house liaoz then one shot pay off...

If both have same amount in cpf after selling. And yet one have more cash on hand. How can u say it's the same?

Regardless how much goes back to your CPF, it is still $1m.  Right?

Whether to pay up fast or slow, one should consider his plans. Is this the only property you gonna own or you plan to buy a second property. For your second prop, is it more for investment or stay. Why? Cos given limited resource, the prop to loan should be the one u rent so that interest payable can be deducted when computing your tax payable.

Your total proceed still $2m what.  Not as if the buyer gonna pay you anything less.
 
Early repayment will resulted in interest saving especially 1st 5 yrs of mortgage which has the highest principal sum.

No you are wrong. Assuming u buy at 1 mil. 10 years later u sell back u have to put back cpf 1.25mil min. Assuming u sell at 1.2mil u still own cpf .05mil. 
Now if u took a loan of 900k and only pay off 150k via cpf. U only need to put back 150k+interest after paying back the bank the 8xx+I of loan after 10 years. That's about 8xxk+150+interest of 150k. Making it less then 1.25mil that u need to pay back the bank.
 
Now assuming both cases u sell at 1.25mil.
 
The one u Pay In full. U got no cash and put back 1.25mil in cpf..
 
Now the second option u still get 1.25mil in cpf but now you have additional 0.1~0.2mil of cash.

Lots of rich ppl here in MCF. But ignore them. Paying ur monthly bill for a roof over ur head is more important.
I used to do that too when I first got my flat. I park $10k of CPF with some insurance company. After they wipe out my OA, cancel the policy and the money returned to my OA. It helps tide me over for a year or so. My pay then was not very high, only $2k/mth. I am not sure which company offers the lowest admin fee, speak to the various agents. They know what to do one.

 
Good idea. 
 
Lowest admin fee and lowest penalty of withdrawal.
 
I am totally against the wiping out of the OA.
 
What if I lose my job and where is the buffer?
 
Anyway this is policy so what can we do?

Go to HDB & nego loh.  As long as you show willingness to pay, your home is still intact.  Why scare of wiping out OA?
 
I have been doing it over 10 yr period.  Today, i have NO mortgage loan.

If you are paying with CPF OA, there is really not much different between wiping out your CPF or keeping it as buffer. I would keep the buffer and stretch my loan longest if I am taking the HDB loan. Remember that the first $60k in your CPF earns you additional 1% interest too.
 
What's the big deal about having no mortgages, when you knew that the money in your CPF over time can redeem the mortgage anytime you want.
 
 
Having no mortgages is really overstated.

if you sell at 1.2 what you will have is
 
1st case - pay all 1 mil when first bought
 
1) cash on hand - zero
2) CPF - 1.2 mil still owning CPF 0.5Mil
 
2nd case - As per the loan I mention
 
1) Cash on hand around 0.5~0.15K
2) CPF - 1.25 mil

1. drag longer = free insurance mah. anything happen to me, the house free for my wife
 

 
Where got free insurance?  You better find out more.  The premium for outstanding mortgage loan is based on the insured's age and amount and period of loan.
 
If the loan is taken in both husband and wife names, usually the premium will be shared between husband and wife. So if the husband dies, only the husband's share of the outstanding loan will be settled, unless the husband's insurance premium cover the wife's share and vice versa.  
 
Drag longer also has a cost besides the insurance on the mortgage. You are paying 2.6% to the lender. The lender will not return you the interest when you sell your flat. The interest is gone for good regardless of whether you pay by CPF or cash.

Nothing comes free..... Mortgage insurance need to pay. Some treat it like a term insurance. There is insurance that cover the loan if either one die b4 fully paying the loan.
 
Coming from 2 perspectives. A businessman might loan full even if he has full cash as the cash on hand might be good cash flow for him and allow him to expend his business. Business loan will be more diff to get and will incurred higher interest.
 
The man on the street might be better off paying off the loan fully, esp if he is low risk profile and the only thing he knows is fixed D. Make no sense for him to park his $$$  there.

Hmm. Hearing some of the reasoning here, I kinda regret pay off so fast
 
Me and wifey got married quite late. So cpf quite sizable. Was planning for 2nd property before Govt chut pattern.
 
300k flat upfront clear out cpf only loan 100k pay off in approx 5yrs.
 
Now that Govt chut all the cooling measures etc seem stupid to pay off early. Kaoz

 
 
i was told by my agent, loan amount will be lesser if u had not paid off 1st property. either way u are stucked had u not paid up in full.

Loan amount for second property will be 50% (25% must be cash) if u have outstanding first loan. Try to pay off your 1st property before buying the next.

yup and worse is the ABSD 7% is stuck with IRAS until the 1st property is disposed off... and this ABSD does not add value to the new property that we purchased... and IRAS do not pay u interest for the 7% that they safekeep...

If you are paying with CPF OA, there is really not much different between wiping out your CPF or keeping it as buffer. I would keep the buffer and stretch my loan longest if I am taking the HDB loan. Remember that the first $60k in your CPF earns you additional 1% interest too.
 
What's the big deal about having no mortgages, when you knew that the money in your CPF over time can redeem the mortgage anytime you want.
 
 
Having no mortgages is really overstated.

 
What is the difference in monetary term? 
 
Annual interest expense in monetary term
vs
Annual interest income in monetary term
 
Don't get bluff by all this extra 1% interest ho
 

1.25 or 1.2 doesn't matter.
 
if you sell at 1.2 what you will have is
 
1st case - pay all 1 mil when first bought
 
1) cash on hand - zero
2) CPF - 1.2 mil still owning CPF 0.5Mil
 
2nd case - As per the loan I mention
 
1) Cash on hand around 0.5~0.15K
2) CPF - 1.25 mil

 
You confuse yourself loh.
 
Total sales proceed = 1.2mn
 
Regardless the amount you get in cash form, your total proceed still unchange 1.2mn.  CPF is still your $$$ what.
 
Not forgetting that if you do early redemption, interest is quite substantial especially during early part of loan.

Ok. Ok... help you to do the calculation.
 
Outstanding loan is $100k.
Balance in OA is $20k.
 
Interest charged for $100k per year is $2.6k.
Interest received for $20k per year is $700
 
Net interest paid is $1,900.
 
If empty the OA balance to pay the loan, outstanding loan is $80k.
Interest charge is $2,080.
 
You will have $180 more in your OA which will attract interest in the future.

Where got free insurance?  You better find out more.  The premium for outstanding mortgage loan is based on the insured's age and amount and period of loan.
 
If the loan is taken in both husband and wife names, usually the premium will be shared between husband and wife. So if the husband dies, only the husband's share of the outstanding loan will be settled, unless the husband's insurance premium cover the wife's share and vice versa.  
 
Drag longer also has a cost besides the insurance on the mortgage. You are paying 2.6% to the lender. The lender will not return you the interest when you sell your flat. The interest is gone for good regardless of whether you pay by CPF or cash.

 
actually having money in OA account may be better then paying off hdb loan
let me sexprain
 
OA: 2.6% risk free
CPF loan: OA% + 0.1%
difference is 0.1%
HDB's mortageg insuraqnce offers exrtremely good rate, much better than a term insurance
 
the cost of insruance is therefore 0.1% + home protection scheme rate
very very very cheap
 
thats why there are people purposely dont want to pay off the hdb even though they have enough OA

Don't look at the interest rate. Look at it from dollar & cents perspective as calculated above.
 
HDB mortgage insurance is cover your outstanding loan amount ONLY.
 
Term life pays out $$$ to your beneficiary.
 
It is 2 different policy.  Don't confuse.

term insurance - 
sum assured remains the same, premium increase with age,
if main breadwinner dies, the family will still nbeed to use the money to pay for the hdb, if not hdb will pester family to downgrade
 
hdb mortgage insurance
sum assured reduces as outstanding loan deceases, premium also decreases
if main breadwinner dies, house is full paid for
 
difference is hdb mortgage insurance is alot cheaper then most term

There is huge difference here.
 
HDB mortgage insurance is mandatory for any mortgage loan.  Even you take commercial loan from bank, MRTA is required.  This is what is called GAP insurance in insurance industry where the insurance is to cover the outstanding loan amount.
 
On the other hand, term life is not mandatory required.  It covers your life during the tenure of policy.  If sum insured is $1m, when policyholder become angel, beneficiary will receive the $1m in cash.
 
Don't mix up both products.

OA CPF balance is usually smaller than outstanding loan amount.
 
Despite higher interest rate, it is still net outflow.

OA CPF is usually smaller, yes. Net outflow? Of course! But clearing the loan with what you have in CPF OA, you will still have a net outflow which is similar to not clearing your loan with OA CPF.

Do u even know what u are talking about?? I had sold my flat before and make the calculation base on both before I decide on whether I want to pay in full for my current flat. The result is simple. I gain more from taking longer loan even when I can pay in full.
 
If u don't believe. Sell ur flat and do the calculation as if u did not take any loan and see. Remember u still have to pay back ur cpf interest rate while counting.
 
Good luck having a better rate using "zero" money to finance that interest.

My mortgage insurance is very little - only something like $100+ per year. 
Cannot run away from it - no matter what it is a requirement from the bank...
 
To try and compare Mortgage insurance and term / life insurance is like trying to compare durians and kiwifruit

I am totally not confused.  I have nvr sell my flat before.
 
You are the one that is confused.
 
What you are saying is cash in hand.  Lesser cash in hand but higher CPF payback.
 
Isn't CPF your $$$ too?
 
on the other hand, what i am saying is saving in term of interest EXPENSES for mortgage loan.

I agree with calculation.
 
A lot of ppl confused with:
Interest expense on mortgage loan = Pay to HDB.  This is AN EXPENSES just like you pay for Bak Ku Teh.
Interest expense on CPF drawdown = Pay to ownself
 
Sales proceed of HDB = Cash on hand + CPF (CPF drawdown + interest on drawdown)
 
I am totally not confused.

Do u even realize that cpf interested of 2.5% that u have to pay back because there is no real money generating is also your expense in interest?? Because nothing is growing and u have to pay back???
 
In a real world... Only this is valid.
 
Cpf+cash which has total higher value.
 
And base on what we had counted and show u. Over a span of 10years already show that it is better to take a longer loan. 
 
Why?? Because our cpf when taking a longer loan is generating real money for interest so we don't have to pay back. Giving that cpf interest rate is up rolling while mortgage loan interest figure is reducing every year. It's no brainier which one is more worth it.
 
Using real money to roll up real interest earn instead of using fake money to row up artificial interest earn which u have to pay back in real cash.

Ok ...
I ran a simple simulation comparing "pay fast" to "pay slow" 
 
here are my basic assumptions
 
1. Borrow from bank at 2% Mortgage interest
2. Borrow $500,000
3. Pay fast is 10 years term
4. Pay slow is 30 years term
5. Sell house after 30 years for $1,000,000
6. All payment is fully from OA
7. The interest rate I used for calculation of repay to OA is 2.5%
8. Opening balance of OA = $500,000
9. No "new" contributions to OA during the full period
10. Interest earned on OA balance = 2.5%
 
Under the "pay fast" scenario - when sell the house you would have to repay to your OA a total of $1,032,357 (topping up by $32k) + you would have balance in your account of $23,118.  OA total would be $1,055,475
 
Under the "pay slow" scenario - when sell the house you would have to repay to your OA a total of $989,359 + you would have a balance in your OA of $67,964 - so you would have CASH of $10,641 - OA Total would be $1,057,343
 
So a point to note - throughout the entire period - you would have MORE in your OA under the "pay slow" - money that can use for education or investment
 
Under the pay fast scenario - you would have to top up when sell house. 
Under the pay slow - you would get some cash

Why not do one for a pay all and 30 years. That will really show the different. 
btw, why was cpf figure after selling in the pay fast be different when under normal situation we should be seeing the same figure??

I think one month out in starting repayments - or simply rounding error of some sort...Yeah, should also be the same, but within 0.2% I think is close enough for our purposes. 
 
If you paid $500,000 "upfront" - at the end of 30 years you would have to repay to yourself (into your OA) $2.037 Million

It's scary owning ourself so much.😅😅😅 
I do understand the rationale behind in which gahmen don't want people to anyhow touch their "retirement" money hence this requirement.
 
But I think there should be some flexibility in this with regard to buying a property to stay.

It's doesn't matter how much u have inside because what u need to pay back is still rolling. What else u place inside is consider "separate" 
Interest own that u need to pay back cannot be cover by monthly contribution.
 
In any situation total cpf paper value for both remain the same. Paying in full only mean u start incurring larger interest rate you loan from ur own cpf faster.

Wah Lau.....
 
You all go and build your own model!  
I'm not a financial consultant or a mathematician - 
Or you can always ask @Turboflat4 if he can advise - his math and logic skills are superb. 
 
 
As to your question - under the "pay fast" scenario - (if my model is correct) your OA balance would be $14,000 (or thereabouts) - so the interest on interest isn't much - it builds slowly from there

Doesn't really matter actually given that pay slow have a larger reserve to begin with. 
Assuming no property bought the figure for both is still the same. 
 
So we only need to calculate the property portion.

Think if there is a shortfall after selling the house, there is Jo need to top up the interest own. Just that everything goes into CPF.

Probably the big takeway - 
 
In terms of "absolute financial benefit" - under most circumstances, pay fast or pay slow - it doesn't make all that much difference (unless pay the whole lot up front) 
 
Making lump sum payments doesn't seem beneficial - UNLESS one of two things - 
1. Your loan interest rate is higher than OA rate
2. You have "other reasons" for wanting to be mortgage free - eg TDSR, deposit requirements for second house etc
 
On the other hand - there are benefits to keeping money in your OA for as long as possible - including the fact that it can be used for education (and for your kids' education) and it is a buffer if "something goes wrong" - after all, in most circumstances, we're not actually talking about paying in full from OA vs taking loan, is more likely that we are considering - 
 
Do we put down a $100k deposit from OA and leave $60k inside or put down a $150k deposit and "only" leave $10k inside. 
 
My general advice would be - keep money in OA for as long as you can!

Think if there is a shortfall after selling the house, there is Jo need to top up the interest own. Just that everything goes into CPF.Yeah don't need. Just that in proper consideration. Better to tell people u still own cpf money... Meaning ur cpf value is no longer the same.
Probably the big takeway - 
 
In terms of "absolute financial benefit" - under most circumstances, pay fast or pay slow - it doesn't make all that much difference (unless pay the whole lot up front) 
 
Making lump sum payments doesn't seem beneficial - UNLESS one of two things - 
1. Your loan interest rate is higher than OA rate
2. You have "other reasons" for wanting to be mortgage free - eg TDSR, deposit requirements for second house etc
 
On the other hand - there are benefits to keeping money in your OA for as long as possible - including the fact that it can be used for education (and for your kids' education) and it is a buffer if "something goes wrong" - after all, in most circumstances, we're not actually talking about paying in full from OA vs taking loan, is more likely that we are considering - 
 
Do we put down a $100k deposit from OA and leave $60k inside or put down a $150k deposit and "only" leave $10k inside. 
 
My general advice would be - keep money in OA for as long as you can! 
 
Personal take is long as the interest different isn't high it's still better to keep in Oa because OA is increasing interest while mortgage is reducing interest value. 
After all 2.6% interest vs 2.5% interest will still show similar result.

Do u even realize that cpf interested of 2.5% that u have to pay back because there is no real money generating is also your expense in interest?? Because nothing is growing and u have to pay back???
 
In a real world... Only this is valid.
 
Cpf+cash which has total higher value.
 
And base on what we had counted and show u. Over a span of 10years already show that it is better to take a longer loan.
 
Why?? Because our cpf when taking a longer loan is generating real money for interest so we don't have to pay back. Giving that cpf interest rate is up rolling while mortgage loan interest figure is reducing every year. It's no brainier which one is more worth it.
 
Using real money to roll up real interest earn instead of using fake money to row up artificial interest earn which u have to pay back in real cash.

 
2.5% i have to pay back is my $$$ because it goes back to my CPF account.  Other than it is not cash on hand, it is still your $$$, right?
 
Taking longer loan means pay more interest to HDB.  Isn't it the case?
 
The only no brainer is to pay more interest to HDB so that you could receive more $$ on hand.

Ok ...
I ran a simple simulation comparing "pay fast" to "pay slow" 
 
here are my basic assumptions
 
1. Borrow from bank at 2% Mortgage interest
2. Borrow $500,000
3. Pay fast is 10 years term
4. Pay slow is 30 years term
5. Sell house after 30 years for $1,000,000
6. All payment is fully from OA
7. The interest rate I used for calculation of repay to OA is 2.5%
8. Opening balance of OA = $500,000
9. No "new" contributions to OA during the full period
10. Interest earned on OA balance = 2.5%
 
Under the "pay fast" scenario - when sell the house you would have to repay to your OA a total of $1,032,357 (topping up by $32k) + you would have balance in your account of $23,118.  OA total would be $1,055,475
 
Under the "pay slow" scenario - when sell the house you would have to repay to your OA a total of $989,359 + you would have a balance in your OA of $67,964 - so you would have CASH of $10,641 - OA Total would be $1,057,343
 
So a point to note - throughout the entire period - you would have MORE in your OA under the "pay slow" - money that can use for education or investment
 
Under the pay fast scenario - you would have to top up when sell house. 
Under the pay slow - you would get some cash
 
 

 
In your scenerio, you did not account for interest on mortgage loan.

Let me summarise.  It seems like a lot of ppl is confused the difference btw the 2:
1. Interest on CPF drawdown.  This is ""the interest you would earned had your savings remained in CPF account".  In short, this is YOUR $$$$$$$.
 
2. Interest on mortgage loan.  This is an EXPENSE that you pay to HDB for borrowing from them.
 
What is the difference?
1. This 1 you will get it back into your CPF if you sell your property.  Because it is YOUR $$$$.
2. This 1 you WILL NOT get it back because it goes concurrently with your monthly mortgage repayment.

No. It will be consider as under performing investment. You don't get any cash. But need not top up your CPF.
That's why the report last week, many CPF members were worse off by investing their CPF money else where.

What is important is final figure after u sell.
 
U can continue to rant but it doesn't change the fact that end of the day paying long u got more money back.

In your scenerio, you did not account for interest on mortgage loan.

Under pay short, the total repayment to the bank is about $100k less - so in that sense you're right - you "pay less to the bank" if you pay off as fast as you can. 
 
if that is your metric - then of course is better to pay  off the bank first. 
 
What people are telling you - there is more involved than just the payment to the bank - 
It's really going to depend on a lot of variables, and each needs to make their own decision based on stage of life. 
 
I have shown that, in a very simple case, even if pay more interest to bank, financially you are "better off" if you pay slowly....

It is true that you get more CASH ON HAND & less CPF, which is important to you.
 
For me, i don't care whether it is in the form of cash on hand or CPF.  It is still my $$$.  All i care is to reduce my interest cost (in P&L term, this is an expense) on mortgage loan.
 
What is missing all the calculation INTEREST ON MORTGAGE LOAN.  This is a real expense which is embedded in our loan repayment.

U have same amount of cpf and more cash on hand.
 
We are not doing accounting here. Who cares about expense when final figure show that u earn more?
 
Expense of mortgage is counted in monthly cpf money out to loan. It is there don't have to double count. Also most important... Don't need to balance the value because we are not doing accounting.

Yes. There is interest on mortgage loan.
But in exchange, you have a shelter for your family for free...
 
Or if you want to compare, then you should look at the rental yield for the home you are staying.
If it is 3% or more, it is cheaper to pay the mortgage loan of 2.6% to the bank.
And, you can renovate and decorate the home as you like.
 
So the bank is providing you a service to move into your new home, even before you save enough to buy it. So, isn't it fair to pay the bank a fee for the service?
 
If you inherit a lump sum from some where, of course, buy a property and pay it off. But many people is not that lucky.
 
Of course, there are people who over use their future money. That's another story.

Absolute value is more important.
 
Earning yield is only applicable when u are choosing location to buy.
 
After choosing location the main thing to check is absolute value which one have better return.

You are right.
Paying back in longer term will incur more interest. 
If a person could only earn enough to service the loan of 30 years, he just have to bare the interest.
Shorten the loan to 20 years, he might run into cash flow issue after a few months.
So, one have to pay a fee for the extra service one's get.

David, you seems to have forgotten about the money that you use to shorten your loan tenure or amount. Those money could have earn you a better return, or when put into cars where interest rate is higher, can save you even more money.
 
If we are only talking about loan repayment through OA, then the difference is only 0.1% or less. You will either use your OA to save on a loan rate of 2.6% ; or keep buffer in your OA whereby our govt will give you a interest rate of 2.5%.

Ok. Let's use actual number.
 
Assuming, you like a unit. Cost $1mil.
Then, people said, the rental yield for that development is 5%.
Which means, the annual rental cost is $50,000.
 
But, if you buy it, the interest rate is 1%+Sibor = 2%.
The interest cost for $1mil (opportunity cost and actual interest paid) will be $20k only.
So, if you have the ability to pay the down payment and get a loan from the bank, would you rent or buy?
 
Now, to make it more sweet, you can use the money in CPF to pay.....
 
I will  have more cash in hand to buy car, go holiday.
 
20 years or 30 years?
CPF max can draw $1k per person only for loan payment.
Push to 30 years lah.
Anyway my income will increase in the future. Then I will do lump sum payment.

Since the beginning, i already told you to ignore the interest rate.
 
Let's say you borrow $500k to buy DBSS.  Year 1 interest cost is 13k (assume you don't pay down anytime).
 
Your OA got $50k.  Year 1 interest income is 1.25k (assume there is no movement in your OA).
 
13k expense
vs
1.25k income.

I think one month out in starting repayments - or simply rounding error of some sort...Yeah, should also be the same, but within 0.2% I think is close enough for our purposes. 
 
If you paid $500,000 "upfront" - at the end of 30 years you would have to repay to yourself (into your OA) $2.037 Million

 
Btw this figure is wrong. Should only be 1.023mil.
 
Ur other calculation also likely wrong. Can recount??

So you pay down the $50k in your OA, and ended up you don't get any interest from OA because it is emptied.
 
But your loan size also become smaller at $450k, so you paid interest of 11700.
 
So the different is only $50 per year my friend for a loan of size $500k.
 
 
If you don't downpay the $50K, you pay a net expense of $11,750 in interest.
 
If you down pay the $50K, you pay a net expense of $11,700 in interest.

Assuming u have 500k cash in a investment that yield a confirm 2.5% interest instead of cpf.
 
Say will u use that 500k to pay off the whole house?? When the mortgage loan is 2%?
 
And later when u sell can u get a better deal then if u didn't pay off the whole house?

Let me educate with direct quote from CPF statement of account:
Property:
Net amount use = This is the CPF principal amount you have withdrawn under CPF housing scheme
Accrued interest = This is the interest you would have earned had your saving remained in your CPF account.
 
What you meant all along is accrued interest on CPF drawdown.  When Joseph22 sell his HDB, Joseph22 is paying back CPF drawdown + accrued interest on CPF drawdown.

Yes this accrued interest is what u own Urself and is rising every year if u pay all in full yearly. U have to find way to make sure u earn that 2.5% comparing to having the money inside cpf. U don't need to as its real money growing the real 2.5% interest.

I only want to tell david that if it is only HDB loan and CPF OA for repaying loans, there is not much financial difference whether fast or slow. But keeping a buffer by paying slow allows some form of flexibility in case you need to pay for your children study, or if you got retrenched suddenly and got no income.
 
The only good things about paying fast in this instance is only bragging right.

This is getting tired let go for a truce.
 
You will be right if we don't have to pay back accrued interest.
 
Yes I know the money still go back to our own"pocket"
 
But if u spend all 500k on property. U have no 500k to generate extra income for this case 2.5% interest
If u drag the loan. U have 500k in cpf earning 2.5% interest.
Now all is good if we don't have to pay back that suppose interest earn if money is not taken out.

You double counted already my friend. The saving is only $50. I thought my explanation is very clear already.

I only want to tell david that if it is only HDB loan and CPF OA for repaying loans, there is not much financial difference whether fast or slow. But keeping a buffer by paying slow allows some form of flexibility in case you need to pay for your children study, or if you got retrenched suddenly and got no income.
 
The only good things about paying fast in this instance is only bragging right.

 
I have no children.
 
If kenna retrench, juz talk to HDB lor.
 
Only in extreme cases will HDB repossess.

Hahaha... I like working out finances, it's like a hobby for me... but the last 3~4 pages have been nothing but CHIM....  
 
Can I say...
 
1) if you are earning more interest than you are paying (in terms of percentage), then longer loan period no problem, 
2) if you are paying more interest than you are earning (again, in %), then go ahead and shorten your loan period, but
3) if you need to top-up your CPF account with cash just to shorten your loan period, then NO.
 
Or am I totally lost and off topic liao?

Btw this figure is wrong. Should only be 1.023mil.
 
Ur other calculation also likely wrong. Can recount??
 
So where u grow the money to pay back to ur cpf??

How you calculate?  
 
First month is 500000 X 2.5% / 12 (1041)
Second month is 501041 X 2.5% /12
 
For 360 months....
 
Interest is compounded

Don't understand much about the outstanding HDB loan with insurance discussion. Anyway can always buy 3rd party mortgage insurance instead of HPS from HDB right?
 
Private insurance is actually cheaper than HDB Insurance aka HPS, nd its portable.. and can choose to keep the reducing mortgage term insurance when all outstanding hdb loan has been fully cleared. 
 
Only advantage of HPS is that the annual premium can be paid using CPF OA while private mortgage insurance only using cash.

Yes correct. Just need to submit the HPS exemption form which can easily be done online.

a fully paid HDB cannot be refinanced. Meaning now you buy 500k HDB full cash or full CPF. 10 years later the value goes up to $1million, the HDB cannot be refinanced out. 
 
In view of this limitation, it may be advisable for those considering full repayment to ensure that they have enough cash savings outside first before making that full payment. 
 
Over the past years of my works, I have seen customers who need maybe 100-200k cash for emergency use or business use, and they have fully paid HDB worth 500k, and CPF OA worth another 100-200k.. $$$ can see, cannot touch.and their only option is to sell the flat off to get the cash profit out, and buy another flat again and use all CPF. 
 
It's true housing loan incurs interest, but it may be more prudent to have cash savings externally first, then use the surplus savings to pay off outstanding HDB loan. 
 
One of my customer in the past told me, bricks cannot be eaten. I ask him what does he mean, and he told me in 2009, his friends with no outstanding housing loan, with cash 200k, and equity investment of 500k, cannot sleep when the shares fell 540-50%.. and become so stress that they decided to sell off the shares at 50% value in case the market didn't recover. 
 
I asked him then what is his position.. and he said his wealth is the same as his friend, he has outstanding housing loan of $1m, cash of $1.2m and investment of 500k.. his portfolio also LS 40-50%.. but he capitalized on the market and buy another 200k worth of blue chip and held on to the 50% value existing investment.. and he can sleep better bec he still can average down some more if needed. 1 year later, his portfolio recovered and he made another 200-300% on his additional smaller investment.. while his friend took a 250k loss.
 
Pai say for the wall of text.. but moral of story is always 量力而为.. and always know the limitations on the assets that you possess, in this discussion is HDB flat.. do find out the limitations and also the pros of course

Hi guys, after reading through all your expert opinions, I think I m still lost, can please help to explain 
 
I narrow the situation to the following assumptions
 
Loan from bank not hdb
Loan tenure - 25 years
Loan amount - 200k, total interest pay to bank if borrow by maxing out the loan tenure - 70k
Early repayment - no penalty n allow
Assume under current interests rate
bank loan - 2% 
Bank fixed deposits - don't know how much but very low around 1%? 
 
Risk appetite - low n don't know what to invest cash in 
 
Using Cash for repayment
 
Pros
1. Interest in bank is lower than CPF, hence it makes more sense to keep money in CPF to earn interest of 2.5%
 
2. Interest paid to bank is reduced when partial redemption is made
 
Cons
1. Unless there's sufficient free cash on hand, this may reduce cash on hand to tide over unforeseen financial needs
 
Using CPF for repayment
 
Pros
1. Can have cash on hand for emergency needs 
 
2. When loan amount is reduced, the interest calculated on original loan amount is reduced, hence in a sense, we can save on paying interests to the bank 
 
Cons
1. Interest earned if the repayment amount had remained in CPF is higher than bank interests on fixed deposits
 
1. If flat is sold, need to pay back into  CPF account the CPF amount used for the flat plus accrued interests on the amount used for the flat meaning you will get less cash proceeds from the sale versus using cash to do repay
 
My questions
 
1. Does it bring more financial benefits to repay earlier using CPF or Cash
 
2. Does it benefit more to 
 
A) slowly pay using 100% CPF n max out loan period of 25 years n pay interests to bank OR
 
B) do partial or full repayment using CPF OR
 
C) do partial or full repayment using cash or
 
D) any other scenarios
 
All advices are sincerely appreciated, 10Q very muchie!

Hi pinobii, with regards to your questions, there is no right or wrong. Both works fine depending on your financial literacy level, investment comfort level, and preference.
 
best if no loan of course, then no interest to worry.
 
Everyone has their own view and preference.
 
Personally for me, I prefer to hord cash and use cpf bec I feel I have no control or decision over it..it pays me 2.5% so what.. I can also make 2.5% using cash and I do whatever I want or deemed fit.
 
but I only have one rule.. which is never lose $ in investment ever..at least have a realised loss position.
 
Based on the questions that you posed, maybe it's better that you save on your CPF and use cash to pay, and only if you have set aside a savings of more than 2 years of income as liquidity buffer minimum.
 
That's my view.
 
Some will think its inefficient to hord cash but well.. better than lose $.. when opportunity arises., huat huat

Hello chucky 
 
Thanks so much for your reply and I greatly appreciate your input 
 
I agree with you on the not having any loan is the best because this lessens any burden and stress to service it especially in event of unforeseen circumstances 
 
My inclination is to max out usage for CPF and top up with CPF lump sum when it accumulates plus cash top up
 
The faster we repay, the better it is. Peace of mind. 
 
Hope you will be back this weekend to spend time with family 
 
Have a great weekend!

bro....last time when i bought my flat i used the hdb's table to check the amount of payment i need to pay monthly! Their calculations are difficult to understand as it is based on the monthly rest basis. Not to sure whats the practice now though but i am sure hdb has more info on loan payments.

my understanding is to pay as much as possible else you are really paying off the interest and have not started to pay the loan amount..
 
see if HDB can allowed to reduce the loan amount when getting your year end bonus or pay more a month

park money outside CPF via CPF Investment schemes and returns the funds when they wipe out ur OA after key collection ba.
 
if ure in queue to pick a unit, then u have some time to think of where you want to park your money to minimise losses (sales charge/admin fees etc). unless ure picking balance flat then u better act fast!

now its easier.. just key in the info required into the website and they can advise u the max loan u can take and how much is monthly repayment. its to allow better financial planning for families and couples..

why do you want to top up CPF with cash then deduct HDB installment from OA?
 
isn't this going 1 big round?
 
also if you put cash into CPF, it gets split up into OA, SA and MA
 
also need to keep track if you have maxed CPF ceiling contribution and cash contribution yearly
 
so much trouble for what?
 
just pay cash directly to loan better right?

although some bros prefer to just let them wipe out OA to reduce total loan amount & interest

The purpose is to have a buffer e.g. if monthly instalment is $1k, park $12k in investment first, sell and have them returned to CPF OA later. In the event of job loss, need not worry about making cash payment at least for a year.

Pros and cons of top up CPF for the shortfall towards monthly instalment.
 
Advantage of CPF top-up (up to a capped amount) is tax deductible i.e. one will pay lower income tax.
 
Disadvantage is that anything paid using CPF incurs accrued interest i.e. when one sells the property, more will need to be returned to CPF.
