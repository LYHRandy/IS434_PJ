Those flat sold under ballot are usually those in popular area. Demand far exceeded supply. Normal lah.
 
I was lucky, got it at 1st try...but it was when the economy was really bad and most people don't want flats in mature estate.

I have several friends tried balloting for flats in Redhill and Q'town. I was shocked to see the subscriptions were 4-6 times over the no. of available flats. So far, most of them got their flat after 4 attempt. Most got it after 2-3 rounds.

I believe the market is softening. My friends just got good deals for 5-room flats in toa payoh. 30-50k COV nia. Just i think is reasonable. Unlike the 100+k they are asking for, just few months ago.

My ex-school mate got it thru balloting, first attempt. He was a newly wed at that time.
 
He's not like some ppl say work for govt or govt related sector.
 
He's now my neighbour staying at over 20 storey in Queenstown area.
 
I think another thing they look at is your combine annual income. If it's relatively high, less likely u'll get it.

the market will soften some more especially when private property prices stabilise and start to move downwards - experts predict in 2009, then hdb prices will move in tandem. right now i think the supply crunch is one reason for the price increase and over exuberant and optimisim for the housing market.

it is because of the stupid policy.
precisely it give people the lottery feeling and hence people treat it as a lottery attitude.
 
There is so many people who just give 10 and try. if kena then get married and if not then wait. kind of attitude.
 
This effectively solve the HDB problem of excess flats. but if also effectively rob those young married couple who wanted a house but got no chance.
 
and the integrity of balloting is not there.

with the integrity of the balloting in doubt.
build more also useless.
 
The reason they annouce they are going to build more is to soften the resale market niah.
To make people scare that they cannot earn 100 k cov so they would let go faster at lower price so to ease the pressure 
Their policy are contradicting each other.
 
secondly, they are coming out with more BTO and the problem with this BTO is when there is not enough demand they dont built. leaving that small proportion of married couple hanging.
so.. it is back to square 1

On e other hand... after staying here for > 5yrs, got used to it and its ok.  AYE coming back is not jammed, from town only 15 min and no ERP charges.  Estate here just been repainted, got new huge sports complex with pool and fun pool rides.  Estate very very clean and even blanga greet u every day - machiam like condo ... hehe.  Impt to have any kinda ride to get to Jurong Point, IMM.  Ur ride cost is of cos "discounted" by the lower price from hdb - maybe can even negotiate with them for better terms?

ballot is difficult.. but if u cant afford resale, go ballot..
 
or else, choose walk-in in a less popular region.. in a less popular flat...
 
basically... LAN LAN... the prices are not determined by govt but the buyers on the streets.. i.e. US.. so i got nobody to blame also!!

Those flat sold under ballot are usually those in popular area. Demand far exceeded supply. Normal lah. 
I was lucky, got it at 1st try...but it was when the economy was really bad and most people don't want flats in mature estate.

 
when economy was bad, no one wanted to buy, thinking that it will drop. I have seen plenty of walk in selection and after months of advertisement, still no taker. 
 
When the market move, HDB withdraw walk in and tell everyone it's fully sold. It's been 1 year for those at Bt pangjang and to date, i have yet to see anyone move in. Guess someone is holding them to up the price

no need to share. you can check out the ratio of the total applications made against the number of unit available. 
 
It's really hotcake coz it's quite cheap even for a 420k 5rm at red hill coz resale at nearby tiong bahru can fetch more than half a million. (however, how many really transacted at that price, you will have to ask the media)
