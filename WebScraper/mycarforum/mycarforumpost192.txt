I like the 1-acre home in Arizona.  
 

1-acre is about 43,560 sq feet.  About 40 units of 5-rm flats!

There are always reasons to be cheap. Fly there and check it out yourself. Talk to the locals, willing to share the neighbourhood truth. I have actually been to US about 2 years back, after a US property show in Singapore. Looks very attractive initially. So when down together with a few friends, and later found out other wise.

depends what one is looking for.
 

For someone who likes peace, serenity, dark and cloudless skies to look at stars during retirement, that location in Arizona is hard to beat

These place you mentioned, may not be suitable for the old. One get old, will need better accessibility. Those are far away places and may have difficulties of getting immediate health related attention. They are only good for short term stay or a get away.

You have to think about the perspective of other place. For instance, you can actually own a house, as in its yours, not leased. 
 

Also, you have to also imagine. Even 40km journey, people complain far. In other bigger place, buying a house, limited greatly the places you can work. When the country is less dense, working places are far apart, easily over 100km. If you rent for instance, you can move easily from city to city. 
 
 

Anyway, nope of these can beat our hosuing in Singapore, unless they have a shopping mall with 5 km radius

I have one in JB, which I bought 7 years again. Nice environment and currently rented out. It only 15 - 25 mins drive. 
 

Planning to buy another in KLCC. But not now.

This actually reminds me of an advert i saw a while back for a farmland for sale in central Canada with a 6 bedroom house and barn on a land space of 33 acres for only SGD$1.8 million.
 

Only catch is that its a bout 45 minutes outside city limits.

For everything, there is an equal and opposite.

Just whether it is organic and sustainable in the long run.

Most teens in the US take their driving lessons in High School from ages 14-16  - many gym teachers double up as driving instructors.   In rich towns, high school parking lots are filled with premium cars driven in by students.
