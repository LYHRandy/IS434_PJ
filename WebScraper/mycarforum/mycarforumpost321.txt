I believe the downturn will hit in the next 12 months. Am thinking of selling my 5 rm flat in exchange for a cheap 3rm flat or just cash out and wait. Have got alternative accomodation.
 
However it seems the prices of HDB flats are seemingly very resilient. With the Govt's policy of further increasing the FT numbers beyond the 1M mark, maybe the prices may not dip so much.
 
Inflation is oso another big concern. So holding onto cash if the expected recession does not materialise will be a big mistake.
 
What do you guys think?

What makes you think property prices will be 30% cheaper even if recession hits. There will always be demand for housing in land scarce Singapore, even if the economy is not doing well.

Going back down again not far fetched.

hmmm. Buy 5 room or 3 room? Frankly speaking, prices will not drop that much like 30%... at most, it increase slowly. High fuel costs which is the mother of all #%$& will inevitably raise the prices of everything. This includes the construction costs as well. Also, during recession, HDB flats will hold the price better than private property. Why? Cos everyone needs a roof but not everyone needs an expensive roof
 
Unless you're talking about the high-end private properties. Cos for them, even a slight drop of 5% for a 2 mio property equates to 100k. That one, you can buy and sell if you've the money.

Yap, can dun buy.
 
But very difficult to call regarding the timing of a recession and how bad it can be. 
 
Just that I am surprised property prices(except for high end units) are so resilient with all the current problems. 
 
Always make mistake in not selling my shares when it is high, so turned my thoughts to the flat now. But I guess this option is only workable and avail to those who can sell and not buy a replacement unit...........................................

Not in that category yet.
 
20% to 30% profit on a 450K flat is still not bad. This is also considering the chance that it could dip back to 350K in a matter of probably two years? That will be the time the market is flooded with new completion of private flats and many upgraders will have to sell their HDB.     
 
Anyone think likewise?

To each his own I guess ... but I don't see any drastic drop in prices if recession hit. At most 5-10% drop in my opinion.

What do u 1 2 do wif d cash on hand?  It will devalue over time as inflation might b as hi as 8% tis yr.  Even though economy has slow down, govt will not let it go into stagflation.
 
Currently, even risk free interest rate will not adequately offset inflation.

My experience with selling a 5rm flat is that big flats are quite hard to move right now. People prefer smaller flats like 4rm or 3rm.... Those en-bloc dudes have all already found places to stay in already, so no one is going to pay silly price for a 5rm flat these days.
 
As such, the price differential between the two may not be very significant unless your existing flat is in a mature estate and you are looking for a smaller place that is much further away. 
 
An alternative is for you to rent out your 5rm flat and and you rent a smaller place in return. The rental mkt is still pretty strong and the asking for a 5rm rental can be quite criminal....
 
Afterall u r prepared to stay in a 3rm. The diff in rent can be betwn $400 - $700. Imagine u get extra $400/ month.... that can help to settle your petrol bills already. And you don't run the risk of getting caught out by the market forces.

Buying or selling of flat is not like buying or selling share.
 
Singapore economy definitelylah affected. Even MM turn bearish. Remember his golden years period prediction?
 
Germany n France, Japan already experience quarter contraction. Singapore akan datang. Definitely cannot escape. 
 
HDB price holding up because of the PR and the hot money Singapore is attracting. Just look at HDB Resale market figure. As long as these PR, Foreign workers find Singapore attractive (ie they haven't kena retrench yet) HDB market should hold n not drop 2 much. But I am not that confident that the economy will hold. It will be one bloody nasty downturn.
 
PS the bottom is when US housing market stabilize.....according to Alan G....
As long as the market don't stabilize..... u can wait for the U turn recovery long long long time.... 
 
PS Singapore economy holding up because of the construction industry. N Govt pin to much hope on F1 and IR to succeed.....But tourism number already hit because Singapore is getting 2 expensive now....

French economy reverse in Q2
 
PARIS - THE French economy suddenly recoiled under global pressures in the second quarter, contracting by 0.3 per cent, official data showed on Thursday, raising a strong prospect of recession.
 
At Global Equities, economist Marc Touati said: 'The French economy is not going through merely a soft spot, but is really in the process of driving into a recession at least as serious as the one in 1993.'
 
Economists focused on one supporting factor, a build-up of inventories, and said that, excluding this, output slumped by 0.6 per cent from the first-quarter level.
 
The statistics institute INSEE, which published the data, said the contraction was the first for nearly six years, since the fourth quarter of 2002.
 
Until now, INSEE had forecast that the economy would grow in the second quarter, by 0.2 per cent.
 
The data was a first estimate, subject to revision, and Insee revised downwards its previous estimate for growth in the first quarter to 0.4 per cent from 0.5 per cent.
 
French Economy Minister Lagarde, said the contraction had been expected but the data was not good.
 
She said the data arose from the sluggish international economic climate 'rises in the prices of raw materials, weakness of the dollar' and inflation.
 
Provisional data from Insee also showed that the number of salaried employees fell by 0.1 per cent during the quarter, but was still on course for an annual rise of 1.1 per cent over 2007.
 
Mr Lagarde acknowledged that there might be less job creation this year than last year.
 
Economists said that the figures showed the loss of 12,200 jobs in the open market sector of the economy.
 
They forecast that the unemployment rate would rise, from 7.2 per cent, with the result that concern about jobs would take over as a depressor of key consumer spending just as inflation looked set to ease with an easing of raw materials prices.
 
They also warned that French budget overspending was now likely to exceed its target and was on course to surpass European Union and eurozone limits of 3.0 per cent of national output.
 
'Overall, these figures raise a real question of economic policy for Europeans,' commented economist Nicolas Bouzou at consultants Asteres.
 
'The United States created the crisis and it is Europe which has the recession. We come back to the same essential question: how do we strengthen the potential for growth in the euroland economy?'
 
At Xerfi consultants, Alexander Law said: 'There is cause for worry. Gross domestic product is falling back, consumption stagnating, service activity weakening, employment worsening, households have the blues and businesses are doubtful.
 
'In this context ... let's be honest, the third quarter is already compromised.' -- AFP

German economy contracts 
 
BERLIN - GERMANY'S economy contracted for the first time for nearly four years in the second quarter of 2008, data showed on Thursday, as demand for its exports fell and inflation hit consumer confidence.
 
The German economy, which accounts for about a third of eurozone output, shrank by 0.5 per cent compared to performance in the first three months of the year, the statistics office said.
 
The reading for growth in the first quarter was also revised downwards to 1.3 per cent from the office's earlier estimate of 1.5 per cent.
 
Taken as a whole, the German economy expanded 0.8 per cent in the first six months. Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is forecasting an expansion of around 1.7 per cent for the whole year.
 
The figures 'point to real economic difficulties ahead,' Commerzbank economist Joerg Kraemer said.
 
'The leading indicators have meanwhile fallen sharply, suggesting that a hard landing is on the cards - although not as severe as in Spain or the UK,' Kraemer said.
 
A string of recent data and sentiment indicators meant that economists had been fully expecting Germany's gross domestic product to have pulled back in the second quarter, and in fact many were expecting an even larger contraction.
 
Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires expected on average GDP to have fallen back 0.7 per cent. Last week a figure of minus one per cent was even doing the rounds.
 
The last time German output fell back was in the third quarter of 2004, when it shrank 0.2 per cent.
 
Figures also out on Thursday confirmed that inflation in Germany hit a 15-year-high of 3.3 per cent high in July, driven by rampant energy and food prices.
 
The two sets of data illustrate the dilemma facing the European Central Bank. In order to keep a lid on inflation it cannot risk lowering interest rates, but high borrowing costs in turn put a lid on economic growth. -- AFP

Japan's Q2 slump hoists red flag for analysts
Nikkei 225 stock average plunges by over 2% or 280.55 points
 
JAPAN's economy shrank at its fastest rate in seven years during the second quarter of 2008, it was revealed yesterday; and while government officials claimed that the contraction could be short-lived, many analysts said that they feared a longer-lasting slowdown.
 
Slip, sliding away: The Japanese economy lacks a driver to stem its decline as exports fall, domestic consumption weakens, and private and public investment shrink
 
With exports sliding, domestic consumption weak and both public and private investment falling, the Japanese economy lacks a 'driver' to stem its decline, they said.
 
The contraction of 0.6 per cent to 2.4 per cent at an annual rate - in real gross domestic product (GDP) during the second quarter compared with the preceding three months - was within market expectations but the broad-based nature of Japan's economic downturn nevertheless came as an unpleasant surprise.
 
In the Tokyo stock market, the Nikkei 225 average plunged by over 2 per cent or 280.55 points to 13,023.05.
 
Weakening oil and other commodity prices may offer some relief to consumers and businesses in Japan, but the economy is still likely to be dependent upon a fiscal stimulus package which Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda's revamped Cabinet has promised to come up with by the end of this month if it is to avoid recession, analysts said.
 
The economy is already in recession by Japan's own standards, which defines recession as a simple downturn in the economic growth cycle, which is this case has lasted since 2002. The more widely accepted definition of a recession is that of two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, however.
 
Private consumption which accounts for more than half of the country's GDP fell by 0.5 per cent in the second quarter as Japanese consumers cut back on spending for the first time in two years. Exports - a key driver of the economy up until recently - meanwhile fell for the first time in three-and-a-half years as demand from Europe slowed following weakening trends in the US.
 
Public and private capital investment were also weak. 'The economy lacks a key driver,' said economist Junko Nishioka at the RBS Securities in Tokyo.
 
'My biggest worry is falling private consumption,' commented chief economist Takeshi Minami, at Norinchukin Research Institute. 'GDP will remain on a downward trend as long as consumption stays weak,' he added.
 
Japan's newly appointed economics minister, Kaoru Yosano, suggested yesterday that the sharp economic slowdown in the second quarter was partly 'a reaction to high growth in the preceding quarter' when GDP expanded by 0.8 per cent, although he also admitted that 'the economy is weakening and downside risks exist'.
 
Mr Yosano implied that the economy should be able to avoid further contraction in the third quarter compared with a weak second quarter. 'There are many strong points in the Japanese economy,' he said. 'Overall, I believe it will be firm. Even though the economy contracted in April-June, it would be more accurate to think that it won't last long.'
 
Private economists were not so optimistic, however, pointing to the few policy levers that Japanese authorities have at their disposal to counter the coincidence of a slowdown in both internal and external demand. The scope for fiscal stimulus is limited by the government's huge outstanding debt while the Bank of Japan similarly has little leeway to ease monetary policy with its key lending rate already languishing at just 0.5 per cent. It may be some time before exports to the US and Europe pick up again and Japan will remain critically dependent on demand from China and other emerging markets, economists said. Corporate capital investment is unlikely to recover quickly in this environment and personal consumption in Japan is likely to be held back by employment uncertainties and the fact that summer bonuses are being cut.

The reason why HDB resale price is holding. Like I said once Singapore kena recession and layoff start to pile up......... u make your own conclusion....
 
 
Soaring rents pushing PRs to buy flats
 
By Jessica Cheam
 
Permanent residents (PRs) are flocking to buy Housing Board resale flats as high rents start to make ownership a more attractive option.
 
Sales to PRs have rocketed in the past two years, say property agents, and the keen army of buyers is helping to keep prices buoyant in an otherwise-flat market.
 
Property agencies PropNex and ERA Realty told The Straits Times that in recent months, about 20 per cent of total HDB home sales were driven by PRs.
 
This is a four-fold increase from two years ago, when PRs bought just 5 per cent of the homes sold, said ERA's assistant vice-president Eugene Lim.
 
Last year, PRs accounted for about 10 per cent of sales, said PropNex chief executive Mohamed Ismail.The sales figures are even more striking for smaller flats like three- or four-roomers, with PR buyers snapping up 45 to 50 per cent of the stock, added Mr Lim.
 
HSR Property Group reports similar figures. PRs bought about 18 per cent of HDB homes recently, said executive director Eric Cheng.
 
The three agencies command about 80 per cent of the HDB resale market.
 
Last year, 29,436 resale flats changed hands. If the volume holds for this year, it will mean about 6,000 flats could be snapped up by PRs.
 
With HDB rents rising so fast, buying now 'makes more economic sense' than renting, say analysts.
 
Rents for a four-room flat in an established estate ranged from $1,000 to $1,200 two years ago. Today, they are $1,800 to $2,000, said Mr Ismail.
 
The penny has dropped for Mr N.E. Shanmugam, who had been renting here for eight years.
 
He pays $1,200 for a three-room flat in Tampines and was initially looking for a bigger unit to move when his lease expired next month. But with rents shooting up, he faced a monthly outlay of $1,800 for a five-roomer.
 
'It didn't make sense. I'm better off buying my own home,' said the 56-year-old project manager, who is married with a one-year-old son.
 
Mr Shanmugam has just bought a five-room flat in Sengkang valued at $380,000. His mortgage will be $1,500 - well under what his rent would have been.
 
Singapore's burgeoning PR population - and their purchasing power - has been singled out as one of the factors driving HDB resale prices.
 
While private home prices inched only 0.4 per cent this quarter, HDB flat prices climbed 4.4 per cent, following a 3.7 per cent rise in the previous quarter.
 
Singapore's PR population rose from 287,500 in 2000 to 386,800 in 2005, according to the Department of Statistics.
 
Property agencies say about 70 per cent of the PR buyers are from China and India with the rest from countries such as Malaysia and the Philippines.

Have seen enough to more or less conclude that a downturn is imminent. That is precisely why I think the time to downgrade should be made within the next 12 months cos by the time it is evident and in full swing, I can forget about getting the prices a 5rm can command today.
 
When the flow of PR goes into negative outflow, the prices will take quite a beating. I may then be stuck and watch the property cycle go one full swing................

I don't understand why need to sell your home even if recession comes, unless your income (employee or self-employed) are threaten. As long as you keep your job, the worse to accept a pay-cut, you still have a home to call your own. Only on paper the value may seems reduced, that's all?

If he sell now, base on the current market, still can get some (or a lot*) cash in hand.
 
Having positive asset is better negative.
 
I would advise him to sell sell sell.  Besides, HDB 5 rooms and above  - said to say, not in demand currently and in coming months. (price very close to condo)
 
Our dear FT cannot afford.

OK, have to qualify that livelihood will not be threaten by any recession.
 
Itz just that I see it as an opportunity to be financially better off. Ya, it sounds like an oxymoron.
 
The reduction may be only on paper but I am trying to avoid the scenario. If I can avoid having my property's value reduced by 100K, shuldn't I take the necessary step? The option avail to me is to sell off the flat. However holding cash to see it being dwindled down by inflation is oso a big concern. Dun know if inflation will be above 5% for the next two years but I certainly do not see it as higher than 30%. I think this is about the flat's price premium as compared to recession times.

I am also trying to sell my 5 room while the PR/local can still afford it.
 
plan is to take the cash and move back to my parent's place.
 
am eyeing on the price of some private properties as well for investment purpose.
 
once recession is here, the PR may head back to where it is cheaper, definitely not  here.
 
thats why I said if you can cash in, go ahead.

Yo Bro, 
 
This is an excellent plan. If recession hits, the cash you have in hand can actually allow you to upgrade to an EA or private condo. Like I say, there are probably many who would like to do this but couldn't cos they need to find an alternative roof over their heads without busting their budget.
 
The worse case scenario is that prices stay flat after you sell. This does not affect you negatively though. If a MAJOR recession sets in, you will thank yourself for not being complacent and actually carrying out your plan.

My flat in Punggol. Not worth much.
 
Precisely, how much you intend to pocket after selling your flat? and a 5rm flat in Punggol is how much? $300K+? Just curious, after paying back your due to CPF, accumulated interests, duties, lawyer fees and etc, how much cash you can get?
 
Where are you going for your next 3 room flat? Some 3 room flats at choice location is more than your Punggol 5 room flat. Don't forget about the high COV that you need to pay these days? Do you need to renovate?

1. Thats why when buying property, location is very important, next come the view. Compare Tampines and Punggol, who will pay top dollar in these 2 estates? the answer is very clear.
 
2. Recently bought a 5room flat at around $380K in Hougang. Some even asked for 100K COV, really crazy! I don't think I can make further profit with this flat. If don't sell at loss next time, I will be happy liao. And I consider the COV portion as sunk cost (write-off).

If you only have one house, suggest not to waste time. If you sell yr house at 400k hoping for it to drop to 300k.....
 
Commission when you sell, say you pay 8k. You buy another 3 room, move and renovate in total you pay up 15k. So you are soothsayer, price drops from 400k to 350k. You think you will sell the 3 room and buy the 5 room again in open market?? Don't think one can make anything. 
 
What's the chance of it dropping to 350k and later goes up again? Don't forget the garmen is smarter this round. They are controling the supply. No order do not build. You will lose years of saving. It also quite unlikely to go to 300k considering inflation and cost of materials. Also, when you sell the hdb the cash may not be that good considering that one has to top up to cpf including cpf interest (on the loan amount depending on the yrs of loan). In any case, the margin is too small for the effort and risk in my opinion. 
 
The choice is yours.... but think twice. Do you know of any rich making money this way?   Better to accumulate your cash now and keep only home. Buy 2nd property when the price is at the low point (make sure it is good enough to attraction rent and return even during bad times), sell 2nd property when price high, if not rent still must cover your cost. If one cannot save enough to buy 2nd house, then my suggestion is not to even think about "playing" with property cos he will likely not have enough holding power.

I believe the downturn will hit in the next 12 months. Am thinking of selling my 5 rm flat in exchange for a cheap 3rm flat or just cash out and wait. Have got alternative accomodation. 
However it seems the prices of HDB flats are seemingly very resilient. With the Govt's policy of further increasing the FT numbers beyond the 1M mark, maybe the prices may not dip so much.
 
Inflation is oso another big concern. So holding onto cash if the expected recession does not materialise will be a big mistake.
 
What do you guys think?
A lot depend on the area your flat is located. If it's in one of the prime area...I would say, it would probably a good move to sell it, keep the cash and wait for the recession or look our for fire sale around 2009/2010. Meanwhile, you can still try to make your money grow a little by parking it in some low-risk instrument eg. term deposit, etc.... 
I am currently thinking about it. My HDB flat has appreciated over 1 fold in the past 5 yrs. The only thing that is holding me back is the location of our alternative accommodation...too far from town.

My flat in Punggol. Not worth much.Sorry, I didn't this post earlier on. 
If this is the case, don't bother to sell now. You would not gain much from the sale. It should appreciate in the mid-term...when the estate is fully developed.

My flat in Punggol. Not worth much.
FYI, you should had gotten your flat 5-6yrs ago quite cheaply from HDB.
 
Estimated selling price in punggol is 360k - 420k range, depending on your location within the estate. Of course the nearer the future town centre, the higher the valuation and the selling price.
 
Please note that if you are going to buy a 3rm with loan (unless fully paid up), you are only eligible for bank loan. 
 
Cash needed for bank loan : (5% of valuation + COV)
 
Assume you bought a 3rm in hougang at 230k (valuation 200k)
Cash needed = 11.5k + 30k = 41.k
Other payment needed (Agents fees for selling, and purchase, Stamp fees, legal fees etc)
 
If you are comfortable with all the above figure, then go ahead.
 
You can only make quite a bit of cash proceed from selling your 1st brand new house.

hmmm. Buy 5 room or 3 room? Frankly speaking, prices will not drop that much like 30%... at most, it increase slowly. High fuel costs which is the mother of all #%$& will inevitably raise the prices of everything. This includes the construction costs as well. Also, during recession, HDB flats will hold the price better than private property. Why? Cos everyone needs a roof but not everyone needs an expensive roof  

Unless you're talking about the high-end private properties. Cos for them, even a slight drop of 5% for a 2 mio property equates to 100k. That one, you can buy and sell if you've the money.

 

what do u think if the more expensive roof become more affordable? will those who still can afford to upgrade take the opportunities to upgrade?  
 

if your answer is YES, then they (those who can only afford one roof at a time) might want to dispose off their HDB at a lower price? what say u?

unless u can sell ur house and buy another at a much lower cost like my dad did in 1996.
 
sold bishan 4A for $480k
 
bought a new 4A at bedok reservoir for $230k.
 
if not seriously no point...
 
u put in so much effort moving house(imagine all the packing)
den u probably only gain a little extra cash...
 
nowadays getting a 50k above valuation is not that easy anymore not mentioning your area...
 
i suggest u keep your current house. unless u can obtain alot of cash from the buyer to offset the new house u're gonna buy, the renovation and yet still have a substantial amt left after all the proceeds...
or unless u're moving cuz the new area is nearer to your office, your parent's place, etc...

Any advice for those who bought new condos recently (on top of their existing HDBs) for long term investment/rental potential? Got a couple of frens who bought mid tier apts in May/June at a lower price (compared to early this year) due to softer mkt...
 
Many telling me that as long as one can hold it out for the long term, property (be it public or pte) will definitely appreciate. Now, that sounds logical but how long is long?
Ideally, HDB owners would wana buy an additional condo so as to be able to sell one off and still have one roof over their head when the next pty peak comes. But it is always hard to time the mkt get one at low.

there is no guarantee or such in this world when come to invest. 
 

how do we know when is the lowest/ peak? we only knows when it bounce back again/ coming down.  
 

for investor, they dun really consider low or high, as long as they think is the right time for them to go into market. 
 

those look for lowest to buy and highest to sell are speculator/ gambler. 
 

Invest in property/ land is still the best form of investment should you hold it long.

if you seriously think that mkt's gonna hit the downturn in the next 12 months and planning to sell your 5 rm flat. then the more you shouldn't be buying any flats. 
Rent instead...
if your 5 rm flat comes down like you predicted, don't you think the 3 rms will follow suit???
Sell your flat, find a place for rent, until you decide that the price for property is at rock bottom, then you buy....

not that long lar, 20yrs is about right 
 

ask your dad/ mum how much they purchase their property 20yrs back and compare it with today's price. 
 

ok, let ask yourself, are you going to sell your "city" HDB to get a "ulu" condo? or you can just simply withdraw some $ from the bank and buy a condo without having to sell your HDB off?

my suggestion: go for bigger unit if you can. Since is an investment, u can consider older unit, cos some bigger old unit just priced not much from a brandnew small unit. Older unit also got chance to get enbloc faster than the newer ones. 
 

as for timing, if you think is right for you, just go ahead, as i said, investor dun wait for lowest to buy, just look at the shares market, there are still people buying despite this uncertain time.

Bro, please do not give hopes of en bloc so easily, studies must be made on plot ratios, GFA, and height requirements, URA plans, market coniditions etc. or simply pure luck on the part of the owner /buyer, besides this year hardly have any en bloc at all, so I would factor this one out of the decision when buying older units.

enbloc is possible on any older development as the land utilisation are not maximise most of the time. even if the plot ratio is not up (in land scare singapore, the future building can only build higher), developer still able to maximise the usage of the existing land, build smaller unit perhaps, less landscape etc etc. 
 

i am talking about long term say 10 to 20 years here, so enbloc is definately a big possibility. and for investment, what is the catch? is the appreciation, so enbloc must be factor in, only good location development will get enbloc first and fast, and good location development easier to rent out to generate income isn't it? so when come to invest in property, all these must come into consideration.

To have flat reduce $100K is not likely.  It's just that COV (cash over valuation) had soften down now as compare to peak time of >$100K last yr.  Valuation of flats are still OK and some still sell for good $$.  
To cash out is to dispoe ASAP as transactions $$ will soften more specially on COV side though valuation may gain by pennies.
 
But looking on the positive side is the I Rs that will be completed by 2009/2010 when it will help to stop the down turn.

Bro, you talk like en bloc development just based on age (older) and underutilised land usage seems to be a given for en bloc sales to happen, what about market conditions, income levels, job prospects, and population growth and URA plans? If all, or any of these factors are unfavourable, 1000 years later, a very good piece of land even if under utilised may still not be sold en bloc or be redeveloped, as there is simply no demand and hence no necssity to redevelop the land. So a 10 - 20 year look ahead to predict en bloc potential may still seem far. 
 
I can name you a development, 999 years leasehold, underutilised, smack in the middle of Orchard Road that is coming 50 years and yet no en bloc sale, imagine waiting 50 years. You want to know where?

Err just re-reading your post, and notice your comment on no change on plot ratio, plot ratio has to change upwards in order for building to be higher, or else if the developer can only put in the same number of units as the old ratio, why would they build higher and build smaller units and have more empty land space?

Right now the IR is the only positive spark for the property market, but how bright the spark and how long it will last is anyone's guess. But I would assume a short one.

no need to name me those, i can see it myself.... even in prime area like D9,10 and 11 there are many many old and run down development which do not re-develop yet, why? 
 

simply becos 'GREED', during the last two years peak, enbloc price getting higher and higher, and the enbloc-er wanting higher and higher, eventually it didn't goes thru becos developer are just not willing to pay for it and unfortunately the market make a turn and 'poof' the enbloc fever is over and they got stuck.  
 

so what i try to say here? there is demand for sure but there muz be a realistic market price to get thing move.

I R is our "HOPE" to avoid/ reduce the down turn wave that already hit U S and Euro now.  
No one can guarantee sure win x2 as Macau already open so many resorts with some even start to suffer losses......
 
As for en-bloc, is temporary like dead now with rules come to curb it and $$ went up too hight last yr.  Guess govt tried to cool it down B4 the FT investors are being scraed off.
Yes in long term, those with potential will still sell (en-bloc).

In my view, IR will only spark up property in certain location such as condo located near MRT where it takes only 15-20 mins to ride to reach harbourfront or Marina.

i think u mis-read my post. 
 

let me quote u an example: 
 

say a 5 story high building with 8 units 2500sf unit on each floor, developer can actually break down the unit to build 16units of 1000sf unit. without having to increase the building height to achieve more units in the newdevelopment, with extra space which uses for landscape in the old development, perhaps they can cut half of the landscape area to build another 2 units with 5 story, there will be additional 10 units in the new development.

Right to the point. 1 of the reasons beside spirilling $$ for en-bloc was the govt seeing good " $$$ " increased the redevelopment fees last yr that almost "KILLED !" it to near Zero deal.

what do u think if the more expensive roof become more affordable? will those who still can afford to upgrade take the opportunities to upgrade?   
if your answer is YES, then they (those who can only afford one roof at a time) might want to dispose off their HDB at a lower price? what say u?

 
the cheaper private properties would provide an incentive for those who wants to upgrade. And yes, they might dispose their HDB at a lower price just so they can finance the new private property but does this make sense in a recession? I believe some would do that they would be a minority rather than the norm.  Which would mean available flats which are sold at a discount would be very little in the market. Unless TS is not fussy over locations, they i believe he would be able to find one within his budget. Buying house is not like buying car... people talk about locations lah, surroundings lah, fengshui lah. And if TS has school-going kids, his choices would be more limited given he would prefer to stay at his present locale. Note this is just my assumption.
 
When it comes to property, it would be usually the rich (with lotsa spare cash) that would continue their buying spree even during recession. That's becos they dont even have to worry about their livelihood. That's how they multiply their wealth. See the trend where the top 5 richest dudes in Singaopore are always involved in real estate? For normal peasants like me!    hahahahaha, we would be more concern about cutting expenditure and maintaining job security during a recession.
 
Going to shares/equity would be a better choice for TS.

Now that demand is low, would not the sellers want to ask for more realistic prices? And when you buy older development how do you know all the sellers would not also be greedy and hence stall the en bloc process? 
 
If demand is really there, no matter how high you ask even with high DC, developers would still buy, which is why the prices rose last year, but this year, demand was simply not there, as prime districts are overbuilt and economic conditions are bad.

No kids. Location not most important as I work a lot from home and have got transport to meet clients anywhere.
 
Think with the current market, if I sell I will not buy a replacement. May just move in with my sis and wait it out. That could work. Just feel uneasy to do nothing and watch the prices slide within the next 2 years. By that time seems that nothing can be done.
 
Also have to factor in the rental income. But I think for HDB flat it may not be very substantial and would most certainly drop very quickly from estimated S$1800 to about S$1200 or less for a 5 rm HDB in the eastern part.

1. I learnt from experience about problem in living in a small  clustered private condo/apartments and as MC executive member:
a) security
Some will construct a guard post/house but there is no quarantee of a security guard. They will always say leave it to the MC to decide.
b) Maintenance
Maintenance not cheap these day, depend on your shares. You want 24x7 security guard, you pay more and not many residents understand that. Many of them are HDB upgraders and they don't understand why need to pay more and they like to compare their fees with HDB Town council.
c) Behaviour
True, there are residents that always like to challenge you to bathe in club house. Again, when you want to collect fee on the use of club house, some will give you nasty remarks. Some smokers will tell him holding a lighted ciggy in lift is not breaching the law . Some tell you inside the house got bee hive, the MC must pay to get rid of them. Come on' your own house, your problem, whether private of HDB.
d) CarPark
I live in Condo, so I deserved to be served, I should be parking 2nd or 3rd car for free. Small condo have limited lots and people don't understand why need to pay for carpark just because they pay maintenance fees.
e) Fundings
Small young estates are usually at the mercy of the developers. There are not much funds for any upgrades and repair. What if the swimming pool leaked? developers at most patch for you, long term who suffered? money again.
 
2. So living in condo has its own set of problems. HDB is still very afforable living. got problem just rang and shoot the TC.

Yes pros and cons.

For the cons:
 
a) Might be appealing to those who want "exclusivity". They will soon find out that this "exclusivity" comes with a price  that they don't like to accept.
b) Might be easier to sell because less units available.
 
Usually for investment purpose, best to sell this type of condo when it is a few years old, particularly so for those cheaper 99 leasehold one. You could get one in 2005 for about 500K and sold around $790K mid year. Now where to find new condo of 500K with decent size?

Maybe it will bring back some of the Genting fans back here.
 
Just look at it this way: no need to drive up, no toll fees to pay, etc. That will offset the S$100 to pay for the entrance.  End of the game just go home N sleep !

that is right. And my father in law has sold off his landed property for 2 mils during the high peak. Now he is having a good  laught. The property is bought by his father many many years ago. 
 
He told me during that time it just cause a few hundred thousand of dollars.
 
He is wating for the price to drop further and will go in the landed house again.
 
It is good when you are cash rich. Right????
