MasterAnswered on 03 Jun 2019The simplest to a common man is to look for IRR return.The internal rate of return tells you how effective money has been utilise. The higher and better the IRR, the more efficient money has been used. The other indicator is how big the nett present value is after deducting the cashflow.0 comments0"
3,"Vincent Tan Wen Bin, Assistant Vice President at Thinkers AllianceLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 31 May 2019If we are looking at endowment plans, to make things simple, look at total effective yield. The projected table of 4.75% and 3.25% does not mean that consumers are getting that return. So look at the portion that shows the return after effecting the cost and you should be able to see your total return for the policy if it performs at 4.75% and 3.25%. If you need help, get an advisor to run through the comparisons for you and see what are the instruments that might pique your interest.0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 30 May 2019Endowment policies are lower risk instruments that allows you to participate in market returns of the participating fund your monies are invested in while providing you with a floor return to protect your capital.It is important to also understand how bonuses are paid out in an endowment policies and what kind of return you can expect to achieve from such a product. There are tons of variations of endowment policies. Some yielding 2+% and some even 4.5%. Some that gives you a yearly coupon like a bond, and some that only pay out at a maturity year (usually 10-25 years away). Some that are meant to supplement you with a retirement income, and some meant to pass on your wealth to your grandkids. So start with an objective. Then find out what kind of return you'll require to achieve those targets. If you only need a small % return, you may not even need to invest aggresively to achieve double digit returns.You may not only invest everything in an endowment plan, but may find some space for it in your overall portfolio. It is still one of the only few products that provides you with guaranteed return that is predictable and reliable.When choosing a policy, look at it's total yield, % of Reversionary Bonus compared to Terminal Bonus, breakeven year, Expense Ratio of the Par Fund, 10 Yr Return of the par fund, Payout Schedule that matches your objective, RB $ paid out per $1000 Sum Assured. Quite a few of these are hard to understand. I'd recommend asking an Independent Financial Advisor for an unbiased comparison to see what products may suit your investment objective.0 comments0"
