On average, I gain enough points to have a $10 Ntuc voucher to be delivered to my house every two months. They do transfer $10 to your PayPal if you would prefer that instead.so whether you think itâ€™s worth your time and effort and revelation of personal information like your income and insurance coverage etc has to be up to you.1 comment1"

5,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Focus groups would be one. I have done a few out of curiosity and they compensate anything from $50-$150 for an hour of your time. You will need to know about the topic being discussed, and provide your opinions. The online survey platforms could pay, but it's a slow grind of answering surveys. Look out for ones like ApiaryBuzz, which actually gave $20 of Capitaland vouchers upon sign-ups! This was one of the rare occasions of getting vouchers pre answering surveys. Use code B3RAD at https://apiarybuzz.com/register2 comments1"

7,"Charmaine Ng, The Value Maximizer at @ Every Ma La Xiang Guo StallLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Most of the surveys online are clickbait to get your personal details. I would very much recommend you to do mystery shopping instead. Mystery shopping requires you to make time to go to physical shops to do observation with a fix set of SOP but at least it gives you real money and isn't collecting your person details for spamming purposes.Otherwise, consider specific panel surveys. Make sure to Google the companies first before passing over your personal data.Hope this helps and please upvote me if you find the information useful.3 comments0"

Which means you act like a customer to check on service levels and proficiency of the clients, that the agency handles. SOP = standard operating procedures. Basically you are to go through a online learning to know what to do and what to ask while at the stores. By taking some pictures and asking the questions you can either receive free meals (capped of course or from a specific selection) and or reimbursement.Charmaine Ng05 May 2019Specific panel surveys are when you sign up for surveying companies; and they'd look into your expertise; age; industry etc. These panels are customized and specific to say; a certain age group or industry."
