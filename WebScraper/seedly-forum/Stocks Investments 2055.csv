1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 19 Mar 2019You can most likely apply the standard valuation methods to value an apple tree, such as intrinsic and relative valuation.For intrinsic, you can look at the estimated amount of free cashflows that this tree produces which is availible to the claimants of the tree, such as anyone who could have lent money for the tree to be planted and the actual owners of the tree. You would then discount this cashflow to today's value based on the opportunity cost associated with the risk of investing in this tree. For example, is there interest on the debt you have taken on to plant the tree? Or what is the opportunity cost if you actually invested in other fruit trees instead?Relative valuation is actually much simpler. You basically take metrics from how other fruit trees are valued, and apply them to this apple tree. Some interesting metrics for an apple free could be ""Enterprise Value / Apples Produce"", ""Enterprise Value / Size of Tree"", ""Enterprise Value / Juiciness of the Apple"". You can get especially creative here but the main gist is that the metric should correlate as strong as possible to the value of the tree. So for example, the metric I mention simply assume that the more apples a tree produces, the more valuable it is. Precendent transactions is also another form of valuation. It's just a fancy term for comparing the target you are trying to value with what others actually paid for it. For example, someone most likely could have bought an apple tree before. Maybe you can compare the valuation of your target tree to how much the other guy bought his tree for?0 comments1"

I dont think there is a model answer per-se, but really seeks to uncover your thought processes and how detailed you can be.Here's how I would have answered it.First, Iike what Kenneth said- I would look at the opportunity cost that is lost with that plot of land. How much is the valuation of the land in the surrounding area. Is that value set to increase in the coming periods/year?Second, I would look at how much cashflows(CFs) that apple tree can generate- approximating how many sellable apples it can produce in a year(multiplied by going-rate of apple prices in that region) and minus costs needed to tend to it(labour, irrigation, fertilisers)Taking the future annual CFs generated by apple tree and discounting it to the present day, one can calculate the Net Present Value(NPV) of the tree- which should be a good estimate of the trees intrinsic value to its owner.0 comments1"
3,"Steph Yeo, Auntie Uncle Whisperer at Agency for Integrated CareLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 09 Mar 2019Here's looking at it from the emotional value perspective: What does that apple tree mean to you?Breaking that up into smaller questions:
Do you like to eat apples? Does the tree bear the kind of apples you like to eat? Who planted the tree? Is that person an important figure in your life? Do you have good memories of spending time around/under/on the tree? Are you intending to continue making memories with the tree?It could be hard to place a monetary value on the tree, but if your answers to the questions above were mostly positive then the tree would be quite valuable to you.0 comments1"
