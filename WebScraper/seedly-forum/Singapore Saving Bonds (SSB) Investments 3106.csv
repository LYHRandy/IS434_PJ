There are other options to explore for higher returns depending on your goals. SSB can be used as a temporary parking for your money. If you are looking for retirement planning, CPF is a great tool that offer 4% guarantee return, and tax relief. Contact me on my facebook if you would like to learn more.  0 comments0"
