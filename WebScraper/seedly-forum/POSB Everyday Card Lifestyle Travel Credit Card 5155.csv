WizardAnswered on 10 May 2018My POSB Everyday card is used as an EZ Link card and has auto topup.​Actually there isn't much difference if you use it as EZ Link or use it to top up another travel card. Both ways you get to clock your credit card spending assuming you use the POSB everyday card to top up your other travel card.​Only disadvantage of using POSB Everyday card as EZ Link, is that if you cancel the card, then you have to set up another EZ Link auto top up again.​Other than that there really isn't much benefit or difference and its up to personal preference. I am just lazy to carry around so many cards. 0 comments1"
