GeniusAnswered on 02 Nov 2018Hi,I personally had a bit of prior experience in the finance sector before joining.Another way to do so is to apply and pass their tests. Depending on the kind of role you might be looking at, I suggest being proficient in excel and visual basics on top of financial knowledge.If you didn't manage to get into the full time role, do lookout for contract roles to pick up some ropes too.0 comments1"
