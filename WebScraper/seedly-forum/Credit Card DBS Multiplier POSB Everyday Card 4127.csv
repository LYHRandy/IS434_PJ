1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 May 2019Your credit card is an account on it own (confusing I know) so there is no need to ""link"" it to your mulitpler.As long as your credit card and your Mulitpler account is under your name, DBS will recognise it so there is no need to do any extra steps.0 comments1"

A credit card is separate from a bank account
For paying of credit card u can use any account
If u are really concerned u can simply transfer money from Yr posb account to Yr multiplier account and pay using the multiplier account
But personally I don't think that is necessary
Best to check with dbs on this.1 comment1"
3,"AA.Alexis25 May 2019Don't really understand what do you mean by linking the card to the account since it's a credit card and not a debit card. 
You do not need to link any transactions(such as crediting salary) directly to the multiplier account as it is synchronized with all the accounts you hold with DBS/POSB. :)"
4,"Tays OoiLevel 1. FreshieUpdated on 26 May 2019Hi Anonymous,I have a DBS Multiplier account. Few months ago, I have also applied for a POSB Everyday card in order to enjoy a higher interest rate. Like what others have mentioned, you don't have to link the POSB Everyday card to any of your existing bank accounts.When the time come to pay your monthly credit card bill, you can simply transfer the money from any of your bank accounts. For myself, I actually transfer the money from my DBS Multi-Currency Account to pay my credit card bills (as I am using the account to pay all my other bills). At the end of the day, I still got my qualified interest rate. Hope this helps!If this is your first time trying to fulfil the credit card spend category, do also remember to use the credit card in retail store. Previously, I have set up the credit card for 12-months installment thinking that it was a smart and convenient move, but apparently that was not considered as a valid credit card spent by DBS - I missed my interest rate for that month.Cheers,Tays0 comments0"
