question,"Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 27 Oct 2018Hello. Looking at the market now, it has fallen quite abit? I am thinking if i should be buying? I am looking at SGX and looking to be a passive income investor.?I am not sure if it will drop further. Understand from my readings from this blog that there are two views - 1) duration in the market, less regard on point of entry 2) capital gains are important, more regard on point of entry as capital loss could wipe out dividends earned for many years3 answersAnswerBump0"

I offer some that have yielded annualized double digits historically. You can reach me here, https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.54, and refer below to my writings and experience with investing. In 2017, I beat the market by over 10%. If you've no investment experience, it may be better to consult a professional for advice. https://www.moneymaverickofficial.com/posts/sti-etf-not-good-beginners0 comments0"
