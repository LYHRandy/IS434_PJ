WizardAnswered on 20 Mar 2019There are also friends to be made in the start-up community, and these are the folks whom you can probably have deep discussions with re: the topics you are passionate about!We all have 24 hours a day, and who we spend the most time with has an implication of who we are.Definitely, truly good friends are worth keeping, so do take out time to spend quality time with those few! You don't necessarily need to 'hang out everyday' to maintain a close relationship. Quality  Quantity.0 comments0"

If your values defer, then there's not much of a choice to stop hanging out with them.Follow your passion but never, ever burn bridges. Even if you do not wish to hang out with them,  for they may be your future partner, employee etc. or even the HR manager who may hire you instead precisely because they know you are driven. Or you may require their expertise instead when you expand your start-up to a SME, and later on MNC.Continue with your endeavour, and just maybe read ""How to win friends and Influence people"" for your start-up dream. Wish you all the best.0 comments0"
