1,"Mabel Tan, Financial Consultant at AIALevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hello!​Just to clarify, ECI coverage does not cover the hospitalisation and surgery cost. The cost is covered by ur hospitalisation and surgery plan under ur basic protection. ECI coverage is generally used to cover the loss of income during the period of ur recovery (Which by the rule of thumb would be x2 of ur annual income, meaning to say when diagnosed with ECI, you’ll be compensated with 2 Years of ur current annual income durIng ur recovery period). And ECI will be paid out during the early stages if your CI. be it stages 1 or 2, whereby the chance of recovery upon Diagnosis of the early stages as compared to the late stages hence coverage for ECI is definitely more expensive. However for late stage CI will only be paid out during stages 3 &4 where the chances of recovery is much slimmer. ​after all, Insurance is always something to help you protect your money. So it might be something u should consider as well. my advice, get it while you’re young and healthy. the younger you are the cheaper ECI Insurance will be. :) ​Hope this helps! 3 comments3"
