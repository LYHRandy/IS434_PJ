1,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Apr 2019I'm hoping for a positive surprise, especially against the backdrop of China's PMI data and US-China trade talks today. Gonna be a good week for investors for sure!0 comments2"
2,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 Apr 2019Definitely I hope to see good news announced on Friday! But frankly speaking with previous quarter's unemployment data hitting a new record low, the chances of the market seeing another surprise and beating of expectations is visibly slim. Moreover with the extended govt shutdown in this past quarter, I believe if anything, employment across sectors would have taken a hit. This would probably be reflected in Fridays numbers.0 comments1"
3,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Apr 2019Given that it's currently late stage right now, I would say I'm only slightly optimistic - the job data won't exactly be eye opening. To be honest, the non-farm payroll of US is projected to only rise by 175000 compared to the 3 month average of 186 000, so we are looking at a bit of dip there in terms of growth. But, with all that is currently in the works right now - the semiconductor industry rally, commodities rally (oil) and the somewhat decent progress in the Us-China Trade talks we could be in for a surprise.But I'm still gonna stay rather skeptical that this growth will continue for long. Business Cycles exists for a reason - what goes up must come down eventually. So maybe its tempting to join in the semiconductor rally right now, but I won't be staying in that rally for too long.0 comments0"
