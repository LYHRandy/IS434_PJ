1,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 23 Sep 2018Besides Seedly articles on the salary survey for 2018 as shared by Gabriel. You can also google for salary range in all the jobsite such as jobstreet, robert walterst etc.​However, take it with a pinch of salt as a general guide only as each company has their own pay scale and varies a lot even in the same industry.​Arm with the general guidelines of the salary scale, next, when you apply for the job, check out the range that is written on the job ads, matching it with the salary survey you've found and depends on the cerifications, ITE, Dip or Degree and years of experience.​With the factors above ,decide what you want to ask for, usually do ask for above medium but not the to hit the final bracket. This is to be seems not overly greedy, but not asking the lower or medium bracket only so that you do not short change yourself. After all, the advertised range is what they are willing to pay and if they are willing to give you what you asked for, Great! If not, they will bargain with you and you can learn to negotiate from there. Do google on how to negotiate :)​0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 23 Sep 2018Check out this article from Seedly which covers your question - https://blog.seedly.sg/salary-guide-singapore/On a side note, you'll have to be flexible as well. E.g. If you have been looking for a job for a few months but to no avail, just take up an offer even if the salary that they're offering is below what you're asking. Gain more exposure and work experience then hop elsewhere in the near future, better than being jobless 0 comments1"
