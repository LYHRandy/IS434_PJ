question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 12 Dec 2018What is the difference in fees between engaging an insurance agent or an FA (tied/independent)?While I still need more information to make a decision, I'm interested in a certain policy which I have generally reviewed and deemed it fairly suitable for my needs. Other than the extent of advice, is there a huge disparity in fees paid to the different types of middlemen?1 answerAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 12 Dec 2018Tied Insurance agents may make more in comissions paid directly to them than FAs. FAs would usually have a banding % with their FA firm.Fee based advisors charge a service fee upfront but may rebate you the comissions paid to them as part of their service package if you get a product from them (not all though, some take both).But either way, you don't pay any different for comissions. It's already in the policy.0 comments0"
