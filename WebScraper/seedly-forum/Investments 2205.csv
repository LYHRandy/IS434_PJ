1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 14 Mar 2019Delve into how the company grew very fast. If the topline is growing fast due to many bolt-on acquisitions done quickly in a short period of time, it makes sense to look at how post-merger integrations are done. If it is indeed growing organically, then understand where this growth is coming from. Units sold? Price increase? Highly discounted? All these growth have different repercussions.As with all analysis, always go into detail :)0 comments3"

MasterAnswered on 14 Mar 2019As with most things in life, moderation is key!Some dangers/pitfalls of a company growing too fast are, but to limited to:1) Potentially facing cash flow issues to meet increasing demand, resulting in liquidity issues 2) Potential operational inefficiency as the company may be pressured to hire as many people and buy as much inventory as possible to meet the increasing demand, hence may lead to poor and inefficient usage of resources3) Potential neglect for customer service since a growing company is about attracting more customers, and this may compromise on the quality of customer service for existing customers; might reduce customer retention in the future and hurting growth in the long run0 comments2"
3,"Mel Tan WmLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 14 Mar 2019I feel what is important is, is the company using its cash wisely? Is it spending too fast on necessary or unnessary items. Is it expanding too fast, even before it is doing too well in the HQ country?0 comments0"
4,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 14 Mar 2019It is not always good if a company grows too fast as well, as Enk Loui mentioned. I think a lot of it could be cashflow, working capital and debt issues that can cause a company to have insufficient cash for its day to day operations. A company that can grow too fast can also suffer from a lack of focus on their essentials, not just customer service, but operational efficiency, employee satisfaction etc which are key to your business. Revenue drivers may go up, but cost drivers very well could as well if they are not spotted in time. Something else I think worth considering is whether or not the demand can be sustained in the long run, or if your increase in demand is merely just a hype that cannot be sustained. Expanding too quickly may cause you to over-commit your resources and not be aware of what your product-market fit is.0 comments0"
