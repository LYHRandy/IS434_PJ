1,"Loo Cheng Chuan, Founder at 1M65 MovementLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Nov 2018It is too blanket a question and it really depends on quite a few factors:a. Have you at least have a sum catered for the deposit of your HDB flat?b. Have you catered for 3-6 months of mortage payments for your housing loan (if you dont have enough cash savings for a rainy day)?b. Have you decided that 1M65 is the way to go for your millionaire dream?if the answer is yes, I would do it if i were you. 0 comments3"
