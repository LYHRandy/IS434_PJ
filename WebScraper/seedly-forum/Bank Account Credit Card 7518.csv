question,"Bank Account Credit Card Asked by AnonymousAsked on 27 Nov 2018Which is the most suitable DBS/POSB credit card for fresh graduates? ?I had just opened my DBS Multiplier Account recently. Overlooked the requirement to hit the higher tier interest rate. Currently have salary credit already. Which is the most suitable credit card for me just to fulfill the credit card spending category? Monthly credit card spending: Starhub - $65 GIRO, Ezlink/nets - $50, some random f&b (ie. Mcd, kfc etc). Most of the time less than $600 (dbs visa live fresh)1 answerAnswerBump1"

2,Question Poster04 Dec 2018Do you mean I shouldn't go for the 1.85% of DBS Multiplier? I heard SAYE have lock-in period which is a turn off for meLok Yang Teng05 Dec 2018You can go for both actually. SAYE is a second account which debits certain amount from your main account. The X amount is then locked in for 2 years monthly.
