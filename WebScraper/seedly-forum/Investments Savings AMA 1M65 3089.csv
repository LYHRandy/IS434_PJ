MasterAnswered on 07 Nov 2018I am aware that personal finance experts provide such a guide for different profile of people, but I do not subscribe to a hard and fast rule. I think it is more important to inculcate a habit of thrift and saving. Once you appreciate the power of compounding, you will realise that every $1 spent could be $10 in the future, you will naturally become more thrifty and would want to invest the money instead of spending it.0 comments0"
