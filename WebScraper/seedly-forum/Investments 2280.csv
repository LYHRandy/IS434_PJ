When you see the prices suddenly pop and move very fast, you also get anxious and want to enter.After a few times of missing out on such good profits, you mental powers get weaker and you tell yourself you won't miss the next big huat opportunity!The moment you enter the trade, the price deflats and you lose money! oh boy!0 comments2"
