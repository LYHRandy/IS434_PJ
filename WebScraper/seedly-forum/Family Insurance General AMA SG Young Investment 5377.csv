ProdigyAnswered on 09 Sep 2018I would think retiring outside of Singapore is not jusy about the money but also whether we are emotionally ready to leave our homeland especially if our family members are still here. For me peesonally, i would prefer to stay in sg as this is a place where i grew up in and my friends and family members are here too. It would be unthinkable to move out completely.0 comments0"
