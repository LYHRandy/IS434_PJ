I believe when you posted this GE was looking pretty sharp from its earnings report- beating analysts expectations. I have not done an indepth research into GE's 10Q's and 10K's - but have catched the headlines recently with their $21billion sale of BioPharma Unit(which investors reacted positively to), befor their announcement to expect negative CFs for the whole of next year on 5th March which spooked investors and led to an 8% drop. I personally wouldnt spend my time doing research on a big company like GE, especially with expected negative CFs for next year. That being said, it is still a stock worth watching in the coming periods- which might present even more attractive valuation ratios to buy into.0 comments0"
