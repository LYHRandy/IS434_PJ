WonderkidAnswered on 08 Apr 2019Given that you've chose investment funds, in this case an exchange-traded fund (ETF) and index funds (through roboadvisors), I'm gonna assume that you're not incline to stock-picking.If I were in your position, I would explore other assets such as real estate investment trusts (REITs), which pay out relatively generous dividends. If you like funds, you could opt for a REIT fund such as the Lion-Philip S-REIT ETF and the Nikko AM STC Asia REIT, just to name a few. However, instead of investing in the STI ETF, which has lower volume and is less dynamic, I would opt for an ETF that tracks the S&P500 for growth.0 comments1"
2,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 08 Apr 2019You should really invest in something that gives you higher yields than both since you're a student. I've written quite a few articles on the subject.  https://www.moneymaverickofficial.com/ You're extremely unlikely to ever exceed 7% annualized net return. If not, you should probably top off your 'Boglehead's portfolio with a bond etf, assuming the robo hasn't already done it to some degree.  https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
