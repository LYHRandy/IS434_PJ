Grand MasterAnswered on 17 Apr 2019Ultimately, a simple guide to decide that will be if the cash that you are going to use for investment, can it generate an income that is more than the monthly loan repayment? If it can’t, then it’s definitely better to pay in full.For example if you car cost 150k total, in order to achieve a higher income generation that the monthly repayment, you may have to put up 100k upfront and take a 50k loan. And put the “un-use” 50k to invest.Ultimately, you must decide if it is also worth your time to do that, cause you might not have made any profit doing this or the profits are marginal.0 comments3"
