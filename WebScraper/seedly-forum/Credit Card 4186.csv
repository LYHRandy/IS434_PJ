1,"Ashley LinLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 10 Jun 2018I agree with Gabriel. When  i first started working, I relied on debit card tied to my savings acct where HR will credit salary into. I took time to understand the credit card system and what works best for my expenses, lifestyle before signing up for one. 0 comments1"
2,"Goh Kah KiatLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 07 Jun 2018If you have secured a job, I would recommend getting your credit card when there's roadshows brought in by your company HR (if they conduct any). Those give the best perks / freebies from my own experience.​However if you do not have a salary, I would agree with Gabriel's answer as it would be difficult to get one unless it's a secured credit card (ie you leave money with the card issuer).0 comments1"
3,Ernest Yeam Wee LeongLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 06 Apr 2019You can get either the Maybank eVibes Card that allow you to earn 1% cash rebates on all your purchasesor get the DBS Live Fresh Student Card with 0.3% cashback On all spend!0 comments0
4,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Jun 2018I don't think you can get a credit card without proof of salary. If i am not wrong, it is a rule set by MAS.​In this case, getting a debit card is your next choice. Get the debit card from the bank you have account with as you can tie the debit card to the account.​If not, i would go for Citi Clear Card. Citi credit cards are rather popular and their dining promotions are among the better ones so this might be good for you.0 comments0"
5,"Dominic ChangLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 08 Jun 2018Maybank Vibes. 1% cashback on almost all expenses. 500 credit limit, if you need more sorry. You can always pay early to free up more credit. Note this is still a credit card. Defaulting on payment WILL affect your credit score. The alternative is citibank student card. It offers you CItibanks huge catalogue of promos. But points rewards with a limit of 500 is hard to accumulate in my oppinion. 0 comments0"
6,Charmaine NgLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 08 Jun 2018I would suggest the Maybank eVibes.$500 credit with 1% cash rebates automatically used to offset your bills. Quarter service fee of $5 easily waived by using your card once in every quarter and they have a promo for Adidas watch giveaway when you sign up today :)  and compared to other cards at average 0.25% rebates this is a clear winner.0 comments0
7,Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 07 Jun 2018Maybe you can try the student credit cards or just go for a debit card.​Most credit cards would require an income payslip to get approval.0 comments0
