As the interest from SSB gets distributed every 6 months, from the 7th month onwards, you'll get the interest from the 1st month, 8th for the 2nd month and so on. A bond ladder effectively.This will last 10 years and will fulfil the extra interest for the investment category of DBS multiplier, at least till they change the regulations.3 comments4"

To continue meeting the ""investment"" criteria, you need to switch funds after 12 monthsPat03 Sep 2019For a more comprehensive understanding, look at C.5 Investments here. https://www.dbs.com.sg/iwov-resources/pdf/deposits/multiplier-programme/DBS%20Multiplier%20Programme_FAQ.pdf"
