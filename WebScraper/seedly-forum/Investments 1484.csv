Itâ€™s good that you have taken the first step of setting up a CDP account, now the next step is to decide which broker you are going to invest with. Search up on the brokers and compare features and prices and see which one is your most preferred one. For CDP you only can hold SG Stocks, which all local brokers provide.I would personally recommend DBS Young Investors account. As a Singaporean i think you probably would have a DBS account, so when you set-up a DBSYI account it would be linked to you DBS Savings/Current account, so it will be debited from your account when you purchase stocks which is more convenient. Also if you do Cash upfront trading where you only can purchase stocks based on how much you have in your account the fees is $10 and the stocks are credited to you CDP which is one of the main advantages of DBSYI.Other brokers charge a minimum of $25 to purchase stocks and for them to be credited to your CDP.I just wanted to provide some insights, please do your own research and choose a broker that suits your needs.Hope this helps.0 comments2"

ProdigyAnswered on 25 Apr 2019Congratulations on taking the first step on your investment journey!Having a CDP account will allow you in participate in the SG stock market where stocks purchased through your preferred stockbroker will be reflected and also allow you to purchase Singapore Savings Bonds and other SG Securities.Now since you are 20 and not sure on how to start investing, the local stockbrokers have programs/accounts for young investors. You can do a search and do your research on them. They will have training sessions and guide on how to start investing on their platforms.However, my advice to you is to first take a look at your overall financial health and understand your future income/expenses/insurance needs/savings/investment needs. Investing is just one aspect of financial management and you really have to cover all aspects in order to be financially healthy.
