1,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 29 Oct 2018Before we start on savings or wealth accumulation, perhaps we should get started on getting your risk covered first. First, ensure that you have gotten yourself a hospitalisation plan to ensure that most hefty medical bills can be covered. Next, get yourself covered with critical illness insurance.Thereafter, do first set aside 6 to 12 months of income/expense as rainy day funds.At the end of the day, the most important thing is to pay yourself first, meaning side aside the amount of money you want to save. It takes discipline to drastically cut down on spending habits, but i wish you all the best in your plans!You may drop me a PM at www.facebook.com/brandan.chen should you like me to take a look at your overall financial standing and work out a feasible plan to cut expenses0 comments1"

God of WisdomAnswered on 30 Oct 2018Hey Anon, instead of looking at a 'savings plan', get a financial plan first.Steps and actions you'll take every step of the way to ensure your goals are met and you get to live life comfortably. Financial planning is not just products. It is a action plan. Some of the basics you need to make sure would be:1) Build an emergency fun of about 6 months of your salary. DON'T TOUCH THIS. Only for rainy days.2) Protect your downside. Hospital plan, life insurance, income replacement insurance.3) Plan your financial goals and requirements. How much by what age, what will the money be used for, % to set aside, optimising your asset allocation, managing your changing risk profile, etc.4) Stick to the plan. Review and update when significant life milestones are met, when your income changes, when new life is added to the household. But stick to it if nothing big changes and watch your goals start coming to life. All the best Anon! :)0 comments0"
