2,See all 3 comments Hariz Arthur Maloy05 Nov 2018No investment is a promise. Also this seems like a ponzi scheme structure. They pay you from your own investments and from others. Until they hit critical mass and leave. Dan Din Don30 Mar 2019Prove it it's a scam. Don't simply say it...

6,"Dan Din Don30 Mar 2019Yes. This a smart answer. Do a research 1st, not answer by saying it's a scam without proving any evidence..."

I don't think this investment is legitimate. 204% in one year is way too high and likely to be a scam. Please be careful.0 comments1"
8,"Lee Chun KiatLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019You are asking if an investment which promises to double your capital invested every single year is a scam?if this is not a scam, you won't see uncle/auntie lining up at nutc fair price to buy TOTO... 1 comment1"
9,Jonathan Chia Guangrong15 Jan 2019Actually doubling returns can be done (I did it last year for my portfolio). But promising it every year is dubious and raises up an immediate red flag

11,Muhd Farrid Mohd NasirLevel 1. FreshieUpdated on 02 Aug 2019Just because it is in the investor alert list it doesnâ€™t prove anything. Manulife was once there when they applied an investment license. I went in on OCT 2018 and MAS put up the alert on Sept 2018. Now it is already Apr 2019 and I have received the monetary payout till Mar 2019. All of the money invested are well documented and all payout are given a payment invoice and also a paper contract with your investment. Plus all dividends are paid to you via bank transfers. All payments recorded. The company not only doing the day trading under FX Primus platform. They have a shipping and bunkering business with Oceanport which has offices in singapore and Hong Kong and they owned Ships. They have a car showroom under DJ Automobile in gambas . They have a F&B outlet Eaterz at Arab street. They have a logistics company under AA logistics. They have an Interior design comapny under Amiris the home decor. They have a financial literacy education arm under Impetus Academy and also a pomade business under beard zooka. The list is still expending. I am sure you all would have heard and seen videos of day traders earning millions a year from doing trades. This is exactly that. if you feel this is a scam up to you. But just dont smear without clear evidence. Btw you guys know that the banks are doing the same thing and giving you coverage of only $75000 for your money in the banks and they make like millions from you and give you peanuts as interest earned...3 comments0

Did you even bother to tell everyone here that they already gave a heads up of what is happening and that the payout is delayed?? Did you even bother to even inform the people here that the company is going through a transitioning period into a new entity that is already certified by MAS and that they already acquired a CMS license?? Did you even bother to share the fact that the company also has other businesses like DJ automobile, AA Logictics and Ocean Port? Plus there are traders out there and this is a fact as young ...

13,"Ck ChaiLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 15 Jan 2019Scam!!!This sounds to go to be true! I was once scammed by a guaranteed 20% returns. Did my research online before investing but nothing negative can be found... send me updates on the returns etc but eventually? Lost all my money!!! 204% Returns??? Never will I believe in this investment!There are so many red light indicators, pls do not anyhow get tempted by those verdict... 0 comments0"
14,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Had a quick look on their website. Don't really look professional to be honest. Seems to be split into various 'businesses' like fx and crypto.. And they are also on MAS's investor alert list http://www.mas.gov.sg/IAL.aspx?sc_p=B. To be frank it's dubious to able to promise 204% returns a year. Doubt that there's any instrument out there can do this conservatively and yet create the same level of returns. I'll suggest getting out asap 1 comment0"

20,Dan Din DonLevel 1. FreshieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I guess whoever say scam... Can u guys provide evidence that it's a scam or do u guys know what is e investment co do u return that much? Don't just simply said it's scam without any evidence. There is someone here had invested  and said they had received their payout monthly.  Cheers guys1 comment0
21,William Ng12 Apr 2019Yes they gave monthly payout so that they have payment proof to refer more people. The person that refer them in will get commission and this thing goes on and on. At the end of the day when the company close down the one suffered most is the last person that invested.
