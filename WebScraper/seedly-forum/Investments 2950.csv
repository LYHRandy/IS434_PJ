God of WisdomAnswered on 14 Dec 2018Skip the STI and SSB and go straight for a global portfolio provided by an FA or a Robo Advisor. You'll have better diversification, constant quaterly rebalancing plus exposure to the world including emerging markets. A moderately aggresive portfolio would do quite fine for your age if you're investing for the long run.0 comments0"
2,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I feel it might be more important to plan how are u going to continue with your investment. Have a plan for long term. Based on what u have mentioned, it doesnt seems like a plan to invest, but just taking a speculative position. Maybe u can plan a RSP into each of the vehicles rather than a one off, and continue to invest with your future earnings. Did your research include which tool to use, which ETF? Which broker will u be using? What will be the transaction cost, is it suited for long term investment etc. What will u do if a major correction occurs, if STI or SP500 dropes 20%, will u continue to RSP? Are u able to deal with several years in bear market action? These are among the questions u should ask yourself first.To be honest, u could just keep your $10k in a high yielding bank account or SSB for the moment. What is important is your future investment actions.2 comments0"
3,"Question Poster14 Dec 2018if i have the cash to spare right now why should i not go ahead with some higher risk options? 
i'm probably going to go with dbs vickers. 
i will come up with a rsp in time, this is just for this sum of money that i have just gotten. Yixiong Chang14 Dec 2018Sure u can. =D But just a reminder to have a long term plan. Since u mentioned u are completely new to investing. I've seen many eventually goes into short term speculation rather than investing which they initially 'planned'."
