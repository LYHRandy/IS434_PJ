2,"Question Poster19 Oct 2018If that $500000 means your own house? Do you need to sell and liquidate the house in order to pay the bills? Hariz Arthur Maloy19 Oct 2018In such a scenario, I'd rather take an Equity Term Loan or a reverse mortgage if its a private property instead of selling. Selling takes time and you'll most likely sell way below the valuation if buyers are aware of your situation. "
3,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 Nov 2018Yes, no matter what is your financial situation, always seek the MSW. They are in a better position to assist you and could provide you with suggestions or alternatives that could alleviate the situation. Just my humble opinion. 0 comments0"
4,"Lim Jin HanLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 01 Nov 2018If you need the financial assistance, do talk with a medical social worker. Whether you qualify or not depends on a lot of factors but there's no harm seeking it.Just because your house is worth $500,000 doesn't mean you don't qualify for financial assistance. And no, they won't make you sell it especially if you're living in it.I'm not sure what your CI is, but hospitals like the National Cancer Center usually have medical social workers there. Just tell the staff you need to speak with a medical social worker and they will tell you what to do. The social worker will also share with you the various assistances available.There are several types of financial assistances available, many of which depend a lot on your household income and expenses. The most common of which that is applicable to you would be something like Medifund, which is an endowment fund set up by the Government to help Singaporeans who have difficulty paying for their subsidised medical expenses even after insurance and Medisave.There could be other assistances available depending on what CI you have. For example, the cancer association gives a one-time lump sum for cancer patients: $500 if you have the orange CHAS card and $1000 for the blue CHAS card.For the CHAS card, since you have income, the Annual Value (AV) of your home will not be taken into consideration. The requirement is as follows:For households with income, the household monthly income per person must be $1,800 and below.For households with no income, the Annual Value (AV) of home must be $21,000 and below.Also, ""household monthly income per person"" refers to the total gross household monthly income divided by total number of family members living together. So, if you live with one parent and you're the only person working making $2500 a month, your monthly household income per person is $1250 and you qualify for the CHAS card. If you qualify, means everyone living in your household qualifies, so make sure to apply for every member in the household by filling in all their names in the application form.In conclusion, request to speak with a medical social worker at the hospital you're at to get all the financial assistance information you need. If you don't request, they won't ask you. Regardless of whether you qualify for all or any of it, you have nothing to lose by speaking with the medical social worker.Wish you the best in your recovery.0 comments0"
