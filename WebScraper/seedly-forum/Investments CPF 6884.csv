God of WisdomAnswered on 14 Jun 2018There are investment options for CPF without using ILPs. ​These are of lower costs and are sold through brokerages like iFast, Navigator, and FAME.​There is no lock up period, you don't pay a bid offer spread, and a Sales Charge and wrap fee can be negiotated with your FA.​An FA can provide portfolios based on your risk profile.​My company have been generating an average of 6.7% p.a (over 5 years) net off fees on a Moderately Conservative Portfolio (60E/35B/5C) for my clients investing their CPF OA. 0 comments2"

If aia funds can perform better than cpf, capital gauranteed or you are able to tolerate some losses short-term for greater long-term gains, then can consider the aia funds...0 comments0"

Otherwise, you may end up like me, making in a loss in my very first CPF investment due to me being a total noob in investment and do not know how to monitor and watch out for trends, and rely solely on my agent cum friend, who turns out to ""hit & run"" after I invested,  Luckily for me, the invested amount is not much as I just started work for few years, and I sold off the funds before all my capital gone into the drain.  For this case, it may have been better if I just leave my money in OA earning the 2.5% interest,0 comments0"

If you don't want to take the risk and fall into the 31% of people who earn less than 2.5%, I'll say it's better to leave the money in CPF :)0 comments0"
