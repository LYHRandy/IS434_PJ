MasterAnswered on 30 Oct 2018If you are looking to profit during the economic downturn itself, you are try investing into defensive industries like healthcare, and Pharma firms.But if you are intending to profit from the crisis, and taking advantage of the lower entry point, the US markets are a good way to start, especially in technological companies and Financial institutions. Besides that, other regional areas of growth that I would suggest is India, China, and Emerging Markets (South East Asia mainly) as the growth potential for these regions are high (if you know how to navigate). Having mentioned the markets, the other point to consider is the how and when to enter. Prices has been tumbling since the start of the year and the drop has been more prounouced recently. I would suggest a dollar cost averaging method, or a dollar value averaging method since no one knows exactly when the lowest price point is and whether the downturn would be prolonged.I specialise in suggesting portfolios that are suitable for my client's appetite.

4,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 31 Oct 2018Perhaps you should monitor the market first as it is very volatile. Your question seems to suggest that you do not have any experience in investment. If you don't, I would suggest you do some research into it first. You have to decide which investment instruments (such as equities, bonds, property etc)  would suit your risk profile. Do not rush into investing or trading the market. Perhaps you may want to consider Singapore Saving Bonds. 0 comments0"
5,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 31 Oct 2018Perhaps u need to first define what is your investment goal. It seems u want to speculate on the potential downturn, rather than 'investing' for the longer term. In general,  It is hard to find a sector that can profit from both normal and economic downturn. There are more 'defensive' areas where the effects of downturn might not be as bad as others. But that is not guaranteed as well. There are several tools and strategy that can be utiliised but it will not be suitable without understanding the risk involved. My feel is that you should slowly learn and study more about the tools available and the markets. Do not invest until you are really comfortable and truely understand what u are risky and getting. Do not just depend on advice of a financial advisor to 'invest' in anything before u really understand the investment itself. There are some good tools to grow your money. If your goal is like for retirement. CPF special account top up ( retirement sum topping up scheme) is actually an excellent tool to use. Guaranteed 4% interest rate, additional 1% up to certain limit. In additional u will receive tax relief for the topped up amount. Eg, your taxable income is $40k, for every dollar u earn above 40k is taxed at 7%. Therefore, if u topped up $1000 into your special account, u get $1000 tax relief, u saved 7% of $1000 = $70 tax money. Effectively have gotten 7% return on your money, in additional u will earn 4% interest yearly guaranteed. 0 comments0"
