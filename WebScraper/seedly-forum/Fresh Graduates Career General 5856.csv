1,"Steph Yeo, Auntie Uncle Whisperer at Agency for Integrated CareLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 20 Sep 2018When i was feeling like shi* at my previous job because i didn't like what i was doing, a colleague told me,  ""don't expect to love your full time job. Do what you love as something part time so you have money from your full time job and still can do what you like after that.""I guess my takeaway is that whatever i do beyond my full time job has to be really worth my time. Something that i really like to do, instead of sth that just brings in cash. 0 comments1"

If I have to regularly bring work (from weekdays) back home to do, then I will have no time for any other types of work as I'd want to spend time with family and friends too!0 comments0"

However, I wouldn't do so (part time on weekends) unless I desperately need the money as I prefer to have work-life balance where I either rest or spend time with my family & friends 0 comments0"
