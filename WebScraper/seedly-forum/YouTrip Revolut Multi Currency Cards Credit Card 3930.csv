1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered 2w agoNo harm getting both, and then seeing what exchange rates are available to you!Given that it's still anyone's game, I do believe that they would look to offer competitive rates!0 comments2"
2,"Ng Wei En, Bsc(Information Systems) at Singapore Management University Level 4. ProdigyUpdated 2w agoYouTrip has a simpler, no-frills, UI for a more fuss-free approach to using a multi-currency wallet. The downside, however, is that it is a one-way wallet where you can load and spend but you're not able to withdraw money out to a bank account.Revolut, on the other hand, if used by someone whose a more experienced user, can leverage on the many functionalities like transferring out to a local/overseas bank accounts, budgeting and analytics tools, etc. Based on my experience, Revolut offers slightly more competitive FX rates too.TLDR:YouTrip - Basic one-way multi-currency wallet Revolut - Two-way multi-currency wallet with budgeting, analytics, peer-to-peer payments functionalities, and more!0 comments1"
3,"Kelly Trinh, Technical services at financial services firmLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated 2w agoRevolut looks more fully-featured and only one use case where YoutTrip would win (o/s spending mostly in JPY) but for other users - Revolut wins.As observed free to join and poke around but do note funds added to YouTrip are 'trapped' without a way to get funds out without charge after trying out (other than spending of course) whereas Revolut can transfer out if turns out not suitable.For longer pro-con of feature set look at my review on the respective Revolut/YouTrip pages.2 comments1"

5,"Leslie Koh, Associate Financial Services Manager at Prudential Assurance Company SingaporeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 2w agoIf you’re comparing on features, Revolut is better. If you’re comparing just on exchange rates, I would say get both since it’s free, and see which offers the best rates at the point of purchase. Based on my comparisons, Revolut wins YouTrip in USD, HKD, AUD & NZD but loses in JPY. Disclaimer: I only compared these 5 currencies.0 comments1"
