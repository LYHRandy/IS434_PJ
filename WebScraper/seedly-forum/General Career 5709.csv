question,"General Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 22 Jun 2019What kind of jobs should I get? I've been suffering at my past 2 jobs.Hi seedly community, i need some help when it comes to FT jobs. I've not been enjoying myself in my past 2 jobs after graduation 2 years ago. 1 was events, 1 was e-commerce. I suspect i might have ptsd from having a very bad experience at the events company. I don't know what kind of jobs to look out for because i'm afraid i will suffer again. The most common advice i've received is to switch industries, any new insights? Thanks in advance.4 answersAnswerBump3"

What are the bad experiences that you've encountered? Bad boss? Tough hours? List it down and you'll know what kind of jobs you want to avoid.What are your strengths? Any particular skills you have? Don't neglect soft skills! Perhaps you are very meticulous, or perhaps you are very good at talking to people. Keep these in mind.What do you prefer? Would you rather fixed timing (eg. 9-5) or random hours (like your events job)? Does colleagues and work environment matter more to you, or pay?Don't be afraid just because of some bad experiences! It's all about luck actually and I sincerely do hope that you'd be able to find a job that you love in the end (:1 comment2"

Sometimes it’s easy to get confused and simply follow what your other friends are all doing. Sometimes you just need abit of silence and listen to your guts.I chanced upon the concept of ikigai awhile back and it helped me think of my career from a different perspective then just making money. You can check it out (https://medium.com/thrive-global/ikigai-the-japanese-secret-to-a-long-and-happy-life-might-just-help-you-live-a-more-fulfilling-9871d01992b7)Read more self-help articles. I enjoy reading the “Self” section on Medium.com. When you read more about other people’s experiences, be it successes or failures, it also gives you a clearer idea what you want and don’t want. Explore jobs outside your usual sector on job portals. If you usually only search for “events jobs”, try exploring the job descriptions of other sectors like social services, tourism, education e.g. You may find something you are actually interested in outside your comfort zone1 comment1"
