question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 13 Dec 2018I recently graduated from University, and have started a job with a start up. There is no office, and most of my coworkers are based overseas. Should I continue with this job?More about this job is that I work from home, as well as do some sales. Our boss is very busy and only checks in with us once every 2 months. So far my sales stats have been on par with my coworkers, despite only working 2-3 days a week. My concern is that I will become too slack and used to this lifestyle. Should I be finding another job?3 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Dec 2018Instead of being concerned about whether you will become too slack, why not take your free time to gain some new knowledge? Attend courses etc or even take a Masters.Also, you should be concerned about whether you are learning at all at the job. If there is no room for personal growth and development, then yes you should consider leaving.0 comments1"
2,"Daniel Lee, Growth Marketing Lead at SeedlyLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 13 Dec 2018I don't see this as a problem! It is great that you are able to hit your work targets and all. With the extra spare time that you have, perhaps you can participate in more networking sessions or grab meetings with more potential clients etc.?However, if you feel that you are not learning anymore and progression is relatively stagnant, it might be good to bring it up to your boss and see if more responsibilities can be assigned to you. That'll at least give you a clearer lease on the current career. If nothing has changed following that, then yes. It is probably time to begin looking for another job. It is important to keep learning and improving, as well as being happy with what you're doing too. 0 comments1"
3,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 20 Mar 2019As long as you are learning as much as you can - why not? However, if you are concerned that it is getting too slack, it could be an indication that you are not learning as much as you would like, especially coming from a fresh grad. Some questions to ask yourself:1. Are you learning as much as you can?2. Is this an industry that you want to progress in? If yes, are there opportunities in similar firms in the same industry?3. What are you doing in your free time to progress yourself?4. Is the company able to give you opportunities where you can challenge yourself to take it up to the next level? As a fresh grad with lots of energy and no children commitments, I highly recommend doing as much as you can in your youth!0 comments0"
