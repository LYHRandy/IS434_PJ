Save in short term cash instruments that can fetch you above 4% to gain exposure, but don't get in any comfort zone. That's how you move forward.0 comments0"

3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Sep 2018Robo advisories will be your best bet, if you don't have time to study other methods of investing. Alternatives to this will be Singapore Savings Bonds or other high yielding savings accounts. Do note that there is a limit for both of these to achieve the maximum efficient interest rate. Limits for high yielding savings accounts vary by bank, so do check each out individually. Common ones often mentioned are CIMB FastSaver (1% for 1st S$50,000, 0.6% thereafter) and Citibank's Maxi Gain (base interest of 80% of 1 month moving SIBOR rate for 1st S$150,000, 0.05% thereafter).​Hope this helps and all the best. 0 comments0"
