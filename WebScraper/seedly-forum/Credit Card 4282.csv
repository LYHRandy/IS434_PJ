1,"Ronald SzieLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 18 Oct 2018I just switched to UOB card, and they have a 20% fuel discount, with $60 spent. I think it's the best deal around since the discount is direct. You can check out this link: https://www.spc.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/UOB.pdfPreviously, I'm using OCBC 365 Card, which has 5% cashback on all petrol. WIth Caltex you get 14% discount and LinkPoints. But there are too many conditions to meet to get these rewards, and with the revision of the minimum amount, I no longer used this card.0 comments1"
