2,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 30 Jan 2019What is your intial feeling when your counter turns red? How about when your counter turns green? Those feelings can create impulse buying/selling which will affect your potential returns. You have to recognise the problem and set limits to yourself, eg. If you want to have a transaction, have 1 day cooldown/observation first to make sure your thoughts are rational. Alternatively, predecide on stop/limit orders so you woulnd't sell/buy in the heat of the momment.0 comments0"
