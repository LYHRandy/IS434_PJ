1,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 22 Aug 2018I use a variety of ways to do cost control monthly to daily bracket. However, the best is do side gig to increase income stream. ​Cost control:1) Have a budget plan. Save first, next is rentals and then investment. Finally on expense. This is because expense is the most flexible components that some is not necessary and able to cut. ​2) Expense : on all expense , mobile may cut via sim only plan or come corporate CIS plan with subscription discount from 20% to 50% and free caller ID. Rental or housing installment depends on your commitment. Next is transport , using only bus, mrt and walk. Finally food, besides meal prep planning, we can also limit breakfast to $2, lunch: $4 and dinner:$4 to make a total of $10 per day. ​Hope the above helps. Cheers :)0 comments4"

This might not reduce your expenses since you need to take in enough calories. What it does is it controls your hunger over time, it also controls your relationship with food. Over time you might find you do not need to eat so much expensive dining​Having a project out of work. This can be learning to sew, learning about how to invest, or learning about philosophy. What happens is that acquiring knowledge and being immerse in it, this requires time. You do not get bored. And because you are not bored you do not have to fill the empty void, like what a lot of people need to do.​Find ways to earn. Some of my peers are crazy to to find how to game the Grabpay, Lazada, Shopee discounts or credit card stuff. This is a project by itself and it takes time. And there is a monetary reward to it. Less idle time and you are learning to save money.0 comments4"

If after months and the desire to get it is still there, even after weighing pros and cons, I will then get it. I feel impulse buying makes you spend unnecessarily and doesn't give you chance to compare prices to get best deal for yourself. 0 comments0"
