I'm already overwhelmed by all the prenatal and first few months stuff (breastfeeding, baby essentials, baby insurance, etc).Also depends on the baby right? Healthy babies with less sensitive skin or fussy feeding preferences = cheaper costs. Our baby isn't out yet so we dunno, and it is hard to budget accurately when we don't know how he's like yet. But we've budgeted $20k for the baby's first year, hopefully it'll be enough! I'll write more on this topic as I research and go along. Becoming a mom is still very new to me! I'll love to hear advice from fellow moms who have already been through it! 0 comments1"
