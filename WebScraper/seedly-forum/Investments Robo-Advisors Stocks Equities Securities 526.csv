Grand MasterAnswered on 17 Sep 2019The last stage of a bull market is the most powered and strongest.Of course, if you enter just before the bear starts, it's going to be a bad decision.The question is: how can I know when is the start or end of the Bull/Bear market?I can't... I am not that good. So I stay invested always, and keep adding, bull or bear. :D0 comments1"
