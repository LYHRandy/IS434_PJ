question,"Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 21 Sep 2019Should I stop diversifying and reallocate my investments into fewer places?I'm a 20yo NSF earning 560/month, and I'm saving 140, investing 147 into a robo-advisor with a moderately aggressive risk profile, investing 154 into a savings insurance, and spending the rest each month. I have other investments into places like Republic (for startups) and Ethis.co (for property development crowdfunding).If it helps, I've got a fully paid scholarship for uni so saving up for the near future isn't really a priority. I'm looking at marriage/housing expenses. Any suggestions?1 answerAnswerBump0"

Look at building your rainy day fund first. It is still important to have one in the event of emergencies. 6 months of expenses at a minimum, and 12 if possible.Secondly, please look into CI coverage and hospitalization cover, I note you have a savings insurance, but as you will step into the workforce in around 5 years, getting yourself covered for CI if you can afford it will be more important compared to saving up a sum of money.Once that is done, you need to have an idea of the timeline you are looking at for housing/marriage. You will want to take a minimal risk if you intend to have the funds ready in 5 years or less, and can afford a diversified portfolio with moderate risk if you are preparing for something 5 to 10 years down the road. For this, numerous options are available to you as a retail investor, such as UT, bonds, shares, etc.0 comments6"
