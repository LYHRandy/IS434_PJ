2,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 27 May 2019Business ProfileSource: Wing Tai HoldingsWing Tai Holdings Limited is an investment holding company with a key focus on growth markets in Asia, with assets exceeding S$4.5 billion. Wing Tai Asia has core businesses in property investment and development, lifestyle retail and hospitality management in key Asian markets. It has a market cap of 1.54B and is currently trading at $2.01.Source: Wing Tai HoldingsIncome StatementFor 2018 itself, the firm is quite profitable, with an astonishing net profit margin of 60%. These margins have improved dramatically over time as more of the returns have been reaped from investments. Revenue, however, has fluctuated slightly since 2016, but earnings have had a consistent improvement.Balance Sheet AnalysisAs a whole, the firm has a very strong balance sheet. The short-term liquidity ratios are very high, which means that the business can react to short-term changes and financial obligations well. These liquidity ratios have also improved consistently through time.The different debt ratios also look very healthy, with the firm holding very little debt as compared to assets and earnings. These ratios have also improved over time, as debt has taken a smaller place within the firm's balance sheet.Free Cashflow AnalysisThe free cash flow of the firm had weakened over time, although this is still a very high number. The higher free cash flow was a result of an increase in reinvestment this year due to larger increases in fixed assets. This occurred despite much better earnings and working capital conditions this year. We can also observe that the reason for high free cash flows is due to high earnings and improved working capital conditions which increased cashflows. The free cash flow to equity had weakened as cash was used to pay off debt. Regardless, as dividends are less than 10% of FCFE, it looks like these dividends should be able to be sustained.Efficiency MetricsThe efficiency of the firm is on the low end due to the large number of assets and equity that the firm has accumulated over time. The low ROE is a result of low asset turnover as well as assets/equity. The reinvestment percentage is also low, due to the negative changes in working capital which increases cashflows. Due to this lower reinvestment rate, it seems that earnings would grow at a slower rate next year.ValuationSome of the metrics look like they are low, while others are high. The equity multiples are low, other than for P/S ratio. The reason why the P/S ratio is much higher could probably be due to how earnings are quite high relative to sales due to the high profitability. This is reflected in the P/S companion variable. The equity multiples look healthy as the accompanying variables look good. Some of the EV multiples seem to be high, however, but this seems to be able to be justified by their companion variables. Despite high free cash flow, the FCF yield and FCFE yield seem to be on the lower end. This is due to the debt that the business had to pay off.Cost of CapitalThe cost of debt is on the low end due to the high-interest coverage ratio. The firm also has a lower market risk. Overall, this results in a lower WACC of 4%. The ROIC is still higher than the WACC, which means that the firm is creating value for investors.Share Price PerformanceThe shares performed poorly over the last 52 weeks, with a negative return. Currently, the shares are trading near their 52-week high. Given the returns and standard deviation of the stock. the share ratio was negative. In fact, the shares seem 1.5 times riskier as compared to the STI ETF.0 comments1"
