If you have changed over a new leaf, believe it and go forth and embrace you as you are now ; changed and for the better. We may be a more conservative society but there's many others that are still open and acceptive to your background. Your description is too brief to add more. All the best! Never let others determine who you are.0 comments3"

4,"Valery LeeLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 30 Nov 2018go to those wsg connect (if that's the right term) at various places. i know there's one at tampines hub and another at paya lebar. make an appointment and you can go meet an advisor who will help guide you in your resume, networking, and looking for jobs. i know it's easy for me to say there are plenty of opportunities out there but due to your circumstances, you can't afford to be picky. be humble, open to learning and seek help, make the right connections. most importantly, don't give up!0 comments2"
5,"Javier Hoo, Financial Consultant at Advisors Alliance GroupLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 29 Nov 2018In all honesty, I believe in people getting a second chance regardless of what past they had. We all had our naive days where we did stuff we can only regret in the future. If you are really determined to look for a job, there should be nothing stopping you. You can start small and probably grow from there, gaining more experiences in the workforce. All the best, Jiayou0 comments2"
