1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 Apr 2019Parkway Life REIT is a popular REIT as it is the lowest-yielding REIT in Singapore and has a portfolio valuation of S$1.75 billion. First REIT was the first healthcare REIT in Singapore and its portfolio is valued at S$1.35 billion. Distribution Yield Parkway Life has a distribution yield of 4.6% whereas First REIT has a yield of 8%. The REIT is also below the average S-REIT yield which is currently more than 6%. Typically, the higher the distribution yield, the lower the valuation. Parkway Life REIT has a premium valuation as it has a below-average distribution yield. Earnings Growth First REIT has a steady revenue growth from $83.3 million in 2013 to $111 million in 2017 (GACR of 7.01%). Its net property income has also risen from $80.2 million to $109.47 million (CAGR of 6.71%). Parkway Life REIT grew its revenue from $93.7 million in 2013 to $109.9 million in 2017 (CAGR of 3.24%). Its net property income expanded from $87.6 million to $102.6 million in 2017 (CAGR of 3.21%).
DPUIn terms of distribution per unit, Parkway REIT has steadily increased its DPU since its IPO in 2007, achieving a CAGR of 7.7% from 2007 to 2017. First REIT grew its DPU from 3.39 cents to 8.57 cents, giving investors a CAGR of 10.9%.Gearing Ratio and Cost of Borrowing As of 31 December 2018, Parkway REIT has a gearing ratio of 36.1% while First REIT's gearing ratio maintains at 35.0%. Both REITs are within MAS's gearing limit of 45%, however First REIT's lower gearing ratio provides it with more flexibility to capitalise on investment opportunities for growth. The cost of borrowing for Parkway Life REIT and First REIT is 0.94% and 3.74% respectively. Growth ProspectsParkway REIT has visible organic growth income and low cost of debt will allow the REIT to fund future acquisitions. The REIT also released in its annual report that the REIT will remain committed to grow its portfolio in Japan to ride on the country's bouyant healthcare sector. As Japan's population is ageing fast, the demand for aged care facilities would drive demand for healthcare properties in the country. The major drivers for First REIT is the growing demand for healthcare-related services in Indonesia and the progress of the national health insurance system _(Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional) _that aims to target the country's populace by 2019. Overall, while First REIT has a lower gearing ratio, it has a higher borrowing cost and longer term to maturity. This places Parkway REIT at a better position in the long term due to its lower cost of borrowing. First REIT's DPU increases at a higher rate than Parkway Life REIT. While both healthcare REITs have a strong balance sheet and  potential for future growth, First REIT has a greater potential as it has historically been able to increase revenue without increasing its debt load.0 comments4"
