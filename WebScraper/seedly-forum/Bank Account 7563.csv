question,"Bank Account Asked by AnonymousAsked on 10 Jul 2018Hi, I have recently opened the DBS Multiplier account. I would like to increase the interest rate by making transactions in the investment category. What are some possible unit trusts to consider if I already have the POSB Investsaver? ?Is it worth it to redeem the investsaver, wait 6 months and invest in it again for it to count as an eligible transaction?4 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Isabella JoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 21 Jul 2018Can consider making SSB ladder by buying 6 months of SSB consecutively. What I read is the interest from SSB is considered as investment. Since SSB pays out twice a year, by buying 6 consecutive SSB, you will get continuous stream of interest income for the next 10 years. You only need to spend $2 to buy SSB and minimum purchase is $500.So far this is the theory which I read. Personally I am still building my SSB ladder and will only get my interest Jan next year. 0 comments1"

Even after you did all those, you only get 12 months worth of bonus interest under the investment category. A better solution would be to get the Singapore Savings Bond every month for 6 months. Interests should come in every month after that, making it a longer term solution :)0 comments0"

ProdigyAnswered on 11 Jul 2018 Good for: ​-Young working adults who just started working (Low salary credit of $2k)-Low credit spending (those who cannot meet $500 spending) ​-New or want to start POSB invest-saver ​-Less than or equal to $50k savings (anything above, transfer to CIMB Fastsaver)  ​My strategy to utilised DBS Multiplier Account: -DBS Credit card spend (at least $1)  ​-DBS visa debit card(5% rebate t&c applies) -POSB invest-saver  Salary credit: $2000  Credit card: $1 Total interests earn: 1.55% ($31/mth)  Salary credit: $2000  Credit card: $1 POSB Invest-Saver: $100 Total interests earn: 1.85% ($38.80/mth)  So effectively, POSB Invest-Saver is commission fee FREE! ($7.80 per month extra to invest) *Only applies for 12mths for POSB Invest-Saver ​This is what I'm doing now and will update after a year on POSB Invest-Saver.Feel free to ask questions :D0 comments0"
