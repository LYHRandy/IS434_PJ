1,"Soon XiaohuiLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 30 May 2018Honestly speaking, there is always 2 sides to any story. ​It is okay to have no agent if everyone in your family is educated in insurance matters (claims procedures, insurance details etc) however let me give you an example on why such knowledge is important. ​Many people do thought hospital claim is simple especially with e filing system. But do you know there are scenarios which requires you to do back claim filing? This means it requires you to make payment first then you claim later. ​​Many consumers do feel frustrated if their claim is having issues especially when their love one is admitted to hospital. They may not think rational on what is the next step especially if they have issues with the bills. Or they are the one who is admitted however their love ones do not know what to do. ​Hope this helps you to understand there are scenarios which you may need additional help. If you have more in depth questions regarding the claims or insurance matters, do feel free to drop an email to me at kate.soon@proinvest.com.sg0 comments4"
2,"GTGabriel Tan Jun WeiLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 28 May 2018By health-related insurance, you would mean Integrated Shield Plan (ISP)? ​You will pay the same premiums even if you buy directly from online or from agents. Hence, I would suggest that you sign Integrated Shield Plan with an agent who will be there to assist with your claims should you be warded. ​Currently, I believe only NTUC Income allows you to buy ISP directly from their website. Premium-wise, I am not very sure if they charge the same as per doing it via an agent. ​If you wish to have a quotation, you can contact me via gabrielgrantt@aia.com.sg​0 comments1"

4,"Hannah FooLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 17 Jun 2018I bought Aviva Term from their website via Direct Purchase Insurance.. I thought they'll follow up with sending me the hardcopy documents and all, but nothing came in the mail. I forsee that making claims may be tough in the future, since I don't have any documentation, except for an email. I'm considering cancelling after one year and changing to buy through an agent instead.0 comments0"

6,"Luke HoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 08 Jun 2018Hi Anonymous, Luke here. I'm an FA who tries to work independently with a lot of companies available, so I'll just give you my two cents on it since some of my competition is direct purchase insurance.​I won't go into the value add of agents, their ability to claim for you and do a comprehensive analysis better suited to your needs, as well as to explain to you in laymen terms the many complexities of insurance claims and policies. I won't go into that.​But in regards to purchase itself, there is no difference. Heh. ​
Gabriel is right, by the way. 
​Have a good one. 0 comments0"
7,"Brandan ChenLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Jun 2018Agree with Xiaohui.The role of agents is to also offer you great customer service (though it's not an obligation) and to assist you to the best of their abilities when claims arise.I doubt there is much savings to be achieved from purchasing health insurance or ISP online. It would be better to have an agent to explain what the ISP covers. Especially so that the ISPs are currently in a state of transition, hence it would be good if you can find an agent to explain the upcoming changes to you!Disclaimer: I am an agent with Manulife Singapore. You may email me at Brandan.chen@manulife.com.sg if you have any questions0 comments0"
