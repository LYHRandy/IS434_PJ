1,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 13 Nov 2018Before u put money anywhere, you should probably try to learn more first. Start attending courses by those big names institutions. Most are free or just a nominal fee. For eg. SGX academyhttps://www.sgxacademy.com/Securities investors association also have a series of programmes for investors learning. https://sias.org.sg/events/events-calendar/I would suggest that u should evaluate what are your financial goals. What do u want to achieve. Thereafter, u can then learn what is necessary. Investing (in general) is a very broad topic, learning somethings will not come cheap (either direct cost in learning fees or indirect cost such as losing money in investment). Knowing what u want to achieve at the end can reduce many unnecessary steps.Another way is to find a trusted financial advisor rep who is willingly and have the knowledge to provide u with the info u need (without any sales bias). Or u can always add me on facebook if u require more indepth discussions. 0 comments1"

By not knowing how to even start investing, it shows that you have little to no knowledge on the subject. spend some time combing through Seedly and the various financial blogs to get some basic knowledge first.0 comments0"
