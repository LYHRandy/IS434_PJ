1,"YY Yin YuLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019As i am accummulating miles, i pay income tax using cardup. I need to pay 2.6% service fee, but in return, CITI Rewards Card offer 4mpd for that. When i calculated, the mile cost is 0.63 cents per mile (which is cheap to me)​If i pay $5,000 income tax using the cardup platform, cardup will change me 2.6% which is equivalent to $130 fee. Citi Reward card will give me 20,520 miles which I can use the miles to fly from SIN to HK via Cathay Pacific on economy cabin + Tax. I think paying $130 for this return flight is not bad.​This is just an example, we usually won't use mile redemption this way. But i hope this illustrate my point. 5 comments1"

6,Rave Ong Ci DeLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019GIRO. Installment plans at 0% interest. Just make sure your bank account has enough funds for deduction. 2 comments1
7,"Stephanie Ng13 Jun 2018Yes, GIRO is a solution but should we use credit cards so to get miles, cashback, rewards etc? Rave Ong Ci De13 Jun 2018If I am not wrong, should be doable. Certain savings account such as OCBC requires at least 3 transactions to be eligible for the higher interests. This GIRO is considered as a transaction. "

9,"Chris Chin, Senior Supply Chain at MncLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 24 Apr 2019I earned Cashback or Credits, when I used AXS Payment App to pay in one lumpsum by Credit Card, instead of by interest free GIRO instalment that don't earn anything.https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Property/Property-owners/Paying-your-taxes/How-to-Pay-Tax/ Quote... Check with your credit card issuing bank if they offer any payment scheme to pay income tax via credit card. You can also use Mastercard (Credit or Debit cards) to pay tax on AXS e-Station over the internet or AXS m-Station mobile app. Credit card payments are not offered by IRAS directly because of the high transaction costs charged by the credit card service providers. This is to keep the cost of collection low to preserve public funds. Unquote...0 comments0"
10,"Steph YeoLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 19 Jul 2018""Best"" could mean different things to different ppl. If you have sufficient funds then paying one shot would be a good way to quickly get it out of your way. If you wanna even out your spending across the year, since giro is 0% interest it is quite a good method.
Do check out HC Tang's suggestion too, cool if you can get some cashback!0 comments0"

14,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Defintiely GIRO makes the most sense :) as it is 0% interest. So its spreading out your income tax across 12 months.​Oh and by the way, I think now the only bank available for this is OCBC if i am not wrong! Last i checked in April/May period.​More reading if you are keen to know what forms of tax deductible options there are for you here: https://blog.seedly.sg/guide-income-tax-singapore/2 comments0"
15,Ck Chai14 Jun 2018I think you are referring to the Giro online application via myTax Portal which is currently available for OCBC customers only.  There are other channels for other banks. read: https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Quick-Links/Payments/Applying-for-GIRO/ :)Kenneth Lou18 Jun 2018Hey Ck yup! Cool thanks!
