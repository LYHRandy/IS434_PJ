1,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Mar 2019Definitely bad news for Boeing for the time being, until the flight records are salvaged and determined if it was once again the similar scenario of equipment failure or pilot inefficiency. I am assuming they are praying for the latter.Boeing's 737 Max is an improvement upon their mainstay iconic 737, but it has already seen 2 crashes within 5 months, the first being with Lion Air. If you go to yahoo finance right now, you can see a 13% drop immediately once the market opened. But the prices have rebounded back somewhat to -7% from market open, probably because there are still those who are confident that boeing's prices will rebound back and instead bought more shares because of the lower value now.We will have to see how they handle the situation, but I still feel boeing will comeback again - their planes are one of the mainstays of the airline industry. Maybe a bet on rival airbus? (EPA:AIR) they've seen a 1.4% increase suddenly. you know what they say, one man's poison is another man's cure.0 comments2"
2,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Mar 2019It is hard to view Airline crashes as short term noise- as such incidences are few and far between and create sizable number of fatalities to generate international headlines.It can be argued going forward- the emergence of additional safety checks will add further costs to Boeing Aircraft production, spiralling costs down to Airlines. Furthermore, Airlines themselves will probably enforce stricter rounds of checks before flight takeoffs. The news might also frighten in SR people in that particular carrier and maybe other budget tier carriers, affecting sales of tickets in coming quarters. All these are things that will be priced in.0 comments1"
3,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 11 Mar 2019Maybe bad news for Boeing, because another incident happened not too long agao. But I'm not sure if it's really bad news for the airline industry in general, since there are probably larger forces at play affecting the valuation of the shares. Apparently it's more likely that you will die in a car than actually die on a plane!0 comments1"
