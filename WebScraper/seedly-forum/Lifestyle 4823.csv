3,"Heng Kai LeLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Well, since you asked...üòù1) Just downloaded an app to track my income and expenditure last month! Hope to sustain my recording of the flow of money in and out of my life for the next three months, at least2) Shed 5kg from my waistline. Not fun anymore when people keep referring to my pot belly, haha3) Cultivate an abundance mindset instead of feeling victim to my circumstance all the time. Money is all around me and I will learn how to invite lotsa money into my life! Time is not scarce; I have enough time to do all (or most of) the things I want to do. Listing just three things here because we humans operate best on the Rule of Three. Easier to march towards success, lol1 comment1"
