If another insurer were to take over, nothing usually would happen to policy holders.You've signed a contract of law as a policyholder, a different principal owner wouldn't change anything. But group term policies might be affected as those can change every year.1 comment4"

https://insuranceasianews.com/is-aviva-to-be-latest-uk-firm-to-exit-asia/ ,""... in addition, it has wholly-owned operations in Singapore ‚Äì which makes up roughly half Aviva‚Äôs profits in the region ‚Äì and Vietnam.""So giving up half of Asia's profit might not be the best decision but hey, who knows?0 comments1"

WizardAnswered on 23 Aug 2019This is actually a pretty good question given the situation now.personally a AVIVA policy holder also üëçbut as what Hariz had shared, it‚Äôs the same like the recent Zurich life insurance sale to Singapore life.all the policyholders with existing policies are simply transferred over.AVIVA is simply too massive and actually i think will survive for many years to come (as most insurance companies do)0 comments1"
