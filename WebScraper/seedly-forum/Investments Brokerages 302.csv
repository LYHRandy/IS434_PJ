Grand MasterAnswered 5d agoIf I am mistaken, they are NOT allowed to advertise for business in Singapore.Yes, some brokers can accept SG clients to trade overseas. They are global businesses.Being regulated by MAS doesn't mean its safe btw. To protect yourself, find out on the history of the broker, what is the measures they are taking to protect investors' money, are the market maker or liquidity provider (forex brokers used by professionals are not market maker, they are known as ECN).1 comment0"
