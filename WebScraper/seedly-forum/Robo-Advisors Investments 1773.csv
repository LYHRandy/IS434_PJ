1,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Apr 2019Hello!I think that putting it into 2 roboadvisors instead of 1 might be better since there is some sort of diversification and diversification is important when it comes to investing. However, if you are thinking of putting into 2 roboadvisors due to diversification, i personally think that trying other forms of investment would be better. I personally would put money into 1 roboadvisor and use the rest of my money to invest in other areas such as stocks and maybe ETFs or REITs.0 comments1"

God of WisdomAnswered on 05 Apr 2019It might be good to diversify and test their strategies, but you honeslty wouldn't know much about their algos in the short term because they don't really have a long track record. This is why I've recently been looking at EndowUs, who instead of using ETFs, they use established, low-cost, institutional class, funds as their investment vehicle instead. Longer track record with sound and tested investment strategy that has outperformed global benchmarks since inception. If you want to link up with them, let me know. :)0 comments1"
