1,"PatLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 01 Aug 2019Walk in to speak to someone at the bank, they sometimes do grant secured credit cards.The caveat: leave a fixed deposit with them (ranges from 10-30k depending on bank!)I personally think the DBS Altitude is good for you as their miles donâ€™t expire + currently have  a transport promotion (up to 4 miles for $1 spent). If I recall their min fixed deposit for a secured card is $10k!0 comments0"

No bank will grant your application.If after including your bonus and you hit the 30K minimum income requirement, you can consider the following 3 cards:1) DBS Altitude Card2) Citi PremierMiles Visa3) AMEX Krisflyer CardAll the best!0 comments0"
