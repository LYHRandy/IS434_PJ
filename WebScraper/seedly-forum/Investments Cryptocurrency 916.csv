To profit from the volatility, one should consider not just longing(buying in hopes that price will appreciate) but also shorting. All the best for your lambo dream!0 comments2"
3,"Huang Yixuan, Product Designer at SomewhereLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 28 Jun 2019I heard it rose after Facebook's announcement about its cryptocurrency Libra. Not sure if it's going to become just a bubble again or people will actually use it. https://qz.com/1651598/how-to-make-money-off-facebooks-libra/2 comments0"
4,"SYSamuel Yip27 Jun 2019It is still a thing. But cryptos are likely to be privatised going forward. Grab, Facebook and most importantly, the banks are starting up their own digital currencies. As for the market, it is likely to be highly partitionised now, we see a lot of different currencies: Grabpay, Dash, LTC debit cards. It is best to put your money in the currency with highest utility now.Huang Yixuan28 Jun 2019Hmm but is Grabpay considered as a cryptocurrency? The value of it doesn't fluctuate with demand, it's just an e-wallet right?"
