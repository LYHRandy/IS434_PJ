question,"Investments Asked by Eric ChiaAsked on 05 Sep 2018Just curious what everyone here thinks of Singapore Savings Bonds?I've a few clients who asked me about them. And I think it has gathered some interest in people. However, personally I'm a highest risk investor profile so it really isn't very attractive to me - at least for now. Maybe my thinking will change 5 years down the road but now, no. Would you buy it and why would you do so?13 answersAnswerBump2"

2,"Eric Chia20 Sep 2018That's if you need a year plus to learn right? Cause I think SSB doesn't give returns (just capital back) if you withdraw within a year? Correct me if I'm wrong!Loh Tat Tian20 Sep 2018They do give pro-rated amount if you park more than 6 months. (but they pro-rate only 6 months. if you draw on 7th - 11th month, they still give you 6 months interest)"

1) i had extra cash which is not earning preferential interest in my bank account, 
2) i don't foresee I'll need that money in the next 10 years, and
3) not a risk takerSo it could be an alternate savings avenue for ppl like me?0 comments2"

The SSB acts as an investmentment vehicle to replicate the bond instrument of investor's portfoilo. Furthermore, if you are to replicate endowment's portfoilo composition by mixing SSB (bond) and ETF (for equity), the projected returns are higher than any  endowment plan on offer in the market.​Furthermore, SSB is a fairly liquid investment which you can liquidate easily0 comments1"
5,"Jay Liu, Diploma in Accountancy  at KHEALevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018Better rates than FD. Backed by the government and not a bank which makes better credibility there. Much better for low risk adverse profile or just someone who wants better interest than the bank. 0 comments1"
6,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 09 Sep 2018Higher interest rates than normal savings account, liquid asset as you can withdraw anytime, capital guaranteed so you can have a peace of mind0 comments1"
7,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019A pretty good option for people to get their feet wet. If you are not into investing but keen to see returns which are better that interest rates in banks (which are not hurdle accounts)​Singapore Savings Bonds are issued by the Singapore Government, to provide Singaporeans with a safe and flexible option for a long-term saving of up to 10 years.​Personally: I went straight into Robo advisors and REITS that yield between 5-8% p.a (for now) and not bought into SSB! But who knows, maybe a savings plan with my other half (Which i've been thinking of doing for a long time)​Right now, our combined savings plan is put into CIMB FastSaver purely for liquidity and yields 1% p.a (easier to transfer in also every month)1 comment1"

9,"Ck ChaiLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 05 Sep 2018For those who are lower risk taker or prefer more liquidity in their spare cash, SSB is definitely a better option than FD.  Only thing is must deduct $2 for every application and tend to over subscribe nowadays.​0 comments1"

12,Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Sep 2018It is definitely a very good option especially in the current climate where interest rates are rising. Moreover it is suitable for people who are conservative and are not willing to take too much risks. 0 comments0
13,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 16 Sep 2018Just a Government issued bond, to provide Singaporeans with a safe and flexible option for a long-term saving of up to 10 years with interest higher than normal bank savings account using 2.x. withdrawal takes 1 month and I don't really think it is that liquid since it takes one month to sell to encash. ​With most that has more than 10k for savings, might ops for high interest savings account or some FD rather. 0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018Singapore Savings Bond is a ""better"" flexible product if we compare it with Fixed Deposit.​Interest rate are higher too.​The downside is more on the allocation are not fixed and there will be a $2 fee incurred for each SSB application.​Again, Certainty vs Uncertainty.This is still consider an option for an Emergency Chest.​Hope my reply helps.​If you feel this reply have Quality, please upvote and check other Quality Reply.​https://seedly.sg/profile/a-kenichi-xi​Thank you.0 comments0"
