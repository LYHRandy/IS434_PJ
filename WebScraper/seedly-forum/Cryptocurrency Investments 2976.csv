1,"Dwivid SharmaLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 04 Dec 2018As per my vision. Bitcoin may take another high in 2022. Things are changing regarding cryptocurrency. More people are getting involved in this type of investment. Although several countries government has banned this type of investment. But on another hand, big players are looking for a middle way to open the door for safe investment in crypto.0 comments0"
