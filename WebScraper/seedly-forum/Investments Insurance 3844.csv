1,"Clarence Chua, Financial Planning Specialist at Prudential Assurance SingaporeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019You should always get your insurance set up first.
Because an illness or disability can take all your wealth or the ability to generate income away in a day.A simple way to set up your priorities for finance in order is a CSI concept. (Coverage, Savings, investment.)Get your money protected, accumulate them then grow them exponentially.Always good to set up a firm foundation then build your tower. üëçüèª1 comment3"
2,"Charmaine Ng28 Apr 2019Insurance should always come first. Investment is to grow wealth but insurance is to protect against the unexpected. You want to be caught with a pleasant surprise but not with unexpected debt.

I would say always go for protection first then growth."
3,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 25 Apr 2019INSURANCE first, INVESTMENT second. Insurance protects the downside, whereas investment is for potential upside gains (of course, it comes with the risk of downside as well). That said, I started investing before I bought insurance policies for myself. At that time, I was 20 and was keen to put money in the stock market first just as a way to learn.0 comments3"
4,"Lilian LokeLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 27 Apr 2019Insurance first, specifically as a working adult, the first insurance you need is to cover hospitalisation costs. At this point, you may have no dependents and thus life insurance (whether whole life or term) can be delayed first. Don't rely on your company's plan as it is usually non-transferable when you leave or get retrenched.0 comments0"

8,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Apr 2019I'll say having emergency funds is important too and this should be done between insurance protection and investment. And never mix up both insurance and investments.0 comments0"
9,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Apr 2019Hello!I personally feel that both are equally important and if you can you should engage in both. Investments may be able to give you an alternative source of income. Should you happen to lose your job, you would not need to worry as much since you have an alternative source of income if you have engaged in investing. On the other hand, insurance is a form of safety net where we may be able to fall back onto should any unfortunate event happen. It would be best to be able to have both investment and insurance to ensure that you will be 'covered' regardless of your situation.0 comments0"
