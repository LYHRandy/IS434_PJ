1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 18 Jun 2019To be blunt, you need to relook at the way you use your credit card.As suggested by Benny, you can consider a debt consolidation plan. Almost all banks offer this service.After which, you need to look at your spending habits and cut those unnecessary expenses. Draw up a monthly budget and stick to it.I can go on and on but that will be based on my assumptions so I would say, spend within your means. To me, the golden rule of owning a credit card is that you can pay off the balance every month. If you can't, you are better off sticking to a debit card or NETS.2 comments2"
