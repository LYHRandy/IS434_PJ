MasterAnswered on 03 Mar 2019It is someone who is familiar or expert financially and can give you a lot of tips and tell you the mistakes he made so that you wont make it as well. You dont really need one to invest. But if you can find someone who is good at it and is willing to be your mentor, good for you.0 comments1"
