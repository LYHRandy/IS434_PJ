From this, they define financial independence as when your passive input cash flow is greater than your current expense. (inflow > normal outflow)Financial freedom is when inflow > normal outflow + few more life goalsBut need not get too tight on definitions and all. Set your own standards;p0 comments6"

WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Means one only spend limited small amount of time to manage an auto streams of income ($ working for you ) to cover all your usual expense without the need for you to go actively spend most of your time working in exchange for $ which in exchange for daily needs of life. Basically able to do what your want or don't do anything daily because you have this $ generating engine working for you to cover rentals /
Installments and daily needs. 😃Haha. F.I.R.E (Financial Independence Retire Early) is the new movement these days but what one do with his/her own free time so that life is meaningful is up to each individual 😋👍2 comments1"
