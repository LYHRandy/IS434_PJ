1,"Jacob Chong, Executive Financial Advisor at PIASLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 02 Nov 2018First what's is your experience in investment. Done any before? if yes good you can stick to those that you are familiar with. example Bluechips ETFs or Unit Trust. If the above sound unfamilar to you, I would ask you to consider the following:1) is this 10k the excess of your emergency fund if yes Good, if No do adjust the sum you want to invest.2) Your investment horizon - how long can you keep the funds invested. short time frame for high returns are very risky products. Risky aka losing your principle entirely is possible3) Whats your risk appetite. Agressive, Growth, Balance etc. because this affects your attitude to the investment if you see your investment drop in value due to market conditions. (would you be very anxious and fluster)4) Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA).  the link explains what DCA is and also why  https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp5) Invest in the market where you know what you are investing to- I.e Banks Shares, Telcom, etc where the news of that particular vehicle that you are invested is easily available and transparent. Hope it helps. 0 comments3"

God of WisdomAnswered on 02 Nov 2018Hey Anon, a great way to start investing passively would be to purchase a globally diversified portfolio from a Robo Advisor or an FA.Its important to start with diversification and sound asset allocation so you'll be able to achieve your investment goals.A good rule of thumb to follow, would be to have your % of your assets in bonds to match your age. 0 comments0"
