1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Buy put options, or sell call options on the Etf. Both will achieve roughly the same effect though the obligations and funding amount will differ. Buying puts mean you need to pay to own the option contract, no margin required. If the price of the underlying Etf goes below your strike price, you can sell off the position for profits. Selling calls mean you will receive money to holding the position, though if the price of the underlying Etf rises above your strike price and the option gets exercised by the option buyer, your account will be holding x negative amount of shares, where x equals number of contracts sold times 100. You will need to put up margin with the broker to sell option contracts. One thing about selling calls is that if the Etf price does not go above your strike price upon expiry, the contract expire worthless and you keep the premiums you received. And you can repeat the process. I'm using thinkorswim to trade options and it's quite user friendly. 2 comments1"
2,"Good Day Every Day15 Sep 2018What is the commission and how much I need to pay if the option is exercised? Thanks. Jonathan Chia Guangrong15 Sep 2018Mm the rates are USD$0.81 per contract plus USD$10.65 for retail investors. Assignment fee is USD16.05.

I'm getting a straight USD1++ per strike per contract rate for options, and about the same rate as above for assignments. The lower rates are negotiated as part of a community and the lowest possible here for ThinkorSwim"
