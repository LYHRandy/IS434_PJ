WonderkidAnswered on 13 Nov 2018Critical Illness coverage is designed to be an income replacement so as your income changes, your level of cover will change too. You do not want to be under insured or over insured (as this will cost too much).My recommended level of cover is for 5-7 years times your annual income overall. Of which, 1 year's Annual Income to be specifically allocated to a plan which payout for Early Critical Illnesses & the balance 4-6 years Annual Income to be under Major Critical Illness.Early Critical Illness cover is expensive and as such, you do not want to be over-paying. 1 year's Annual Income is sufficient as treatment is covered by a 100% as charged Medishield Plan & most people who are diagnosed with an Early Critical Illness are back to work within 6 months to 1 year. 0 comments0"
