God of WisdomAnswered on 18 Oct 2018You have a 40 year time horizon and can invest in the global market to achieve wealth accumulation and higher returns.Your asset strategy will change with your age, slowly moving towards higher guaranteed assets at a later age when you're closer to retirement for capital preservation.Instead of looking for a product to purchase, do some retirement & investment planning.After that, then find products that will fit what you're planning to do and meet your objectives.Also retirement means very different to different people. Some want to live off dividends and coupon payments. A very passive retirement.Some would prefer to do a drawdown retirement to maximize all the wealth they've built over their years.You should speak to a trusted advisor or specialist to figure a path out for your retirement.0 comments1"

This becomes a skill which will last you a lifetime. No point locking up your money in long term policies which cost a pretty penny and the returns pale in comparison to what you can get when you invest on your own. 0 comments0"
