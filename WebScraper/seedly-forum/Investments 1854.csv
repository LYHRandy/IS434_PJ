1,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Apr 2019There are all kinds of index around the world. For US, 1 example is the S&P 500. For SG, the example is the STI. So a lot of people will compare their returns using a index as a benchmark. So if you were to beat the index that you used as a benchmark, it means that you have successfully beat the market.0 comments0"
