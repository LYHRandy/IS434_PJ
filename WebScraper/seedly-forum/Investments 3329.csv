If the market goes against REITs you must be able to stomach a heavy paper loss because of all REITs.​Even though there are different REITs in different sectors, they are still considered as property sector.​REITs can also issue rights, and if you have many REITs, be prepared with cash to subscribe otherwise you will be diluted.0 comments1"

E.g. 1.Healthcare REITS, 2.Hospitality REITS, 3.Retail REITS. Healthcare REITS are considered the most stable. Hospitality REITS are highly sensitive to economy and very cyclical. Retail REITS is easiest to appreciate whether doing well anot. Read more about REITS. And then combine different sectors of REITS to make a 100% portfolio for constant dividends. 0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 25 Sep 2018Most people typically want paid out dividends for passive income - and unless your situation is unique (e.g. long term care), you may want to just accumulate it. ​REITs isn't too bad in this area and a concentrated amount has a historicial record of smashing inflation. As a young person, I'd say (GENERALLY) you can absorb this risk.​That being said, for dividends you may want to explore safer fixed income options as well, that can still pay you 6 - 8% yields comfortably with less volatiility. ​You could always reach me here if interested. ​https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.54​​0 comments0"
