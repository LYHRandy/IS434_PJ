Lets say..I have 10,000 to invest. ?A rule of thumb - have 25% in bonds. In that case, I will have 75% in equities. Is there a percentage which I have to allocate to reits etc.?1 answerAnswerBump1"

1,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019REITs are part of equitites, there is no definite allocation percentage. You dont have to follow the age rule of thumb as well because if you are a person who cant take too much risk, you would want to have more bonds. Have your emergency fund and insurance ready before you start investing. I would recommend you go for some capital growth as well not just REITs.1 comment0"
