RookieUpdated on 20 Nov 2018How many people I know are doing:Don't spend more than your income (duh), use CC only for low to 0% instalment plans or if the product/services have some special sales promo for it. Avoid paying min. you will fall into a debt trap.Use a Debit card for everything else. Especially if you're someone that don't keep track of your spendings regularly... at least you will start be more aware everytime you see your bank balance get lesser and lesser.Personally I've never fallen into the trap but from what I observed from my friends and relatives, the only way is to make a lot of sacrifises to increase their income and reduce their lifestyle expenses for the period till they pay it all off, then never to make the same mistake again.0 comments0"

Instead, get a debit card. Next, try to clear off your credit card debt as soon as possible so as to reduce the amount of interest and late payment fees payable. And as others have suggested, cut on unnecessary spending. You can use the Seedly app to sync your bank and/or credit card transactions to see your expenditures and cashflow and try to do budgeting to see where you can reduce your spending on. 0 comments0"

You seriously need a review on your spending habits.1) Cut your credit card so you can't buy on credit any more.2) Look at your fixed expenditures. Set aside income to pay for these essential stuff3) Cut unnecessary spendings which are not a NEED. You can drink your bubbletea 3 months later.4) Look for a trusted friend to DRILL this into you. STOP unnecessary spending. (you will probably hate this friend for at least the next few months).5) Discipline yourself. starting from now. Start paying off all credit card debts and refinance with personal loan (which has lower interest rate).0 comments0

WonderkidAnswered on 19 Nov 2018You may consider contacting:https://www.ccs.org.sg/services/page/debt-management-programmeIf you would like to go it alone, some tips would be:Stop using the credit cards with immediate effect (to prevent further increases to the amount outstanding).Start spending less. Use cash or your debit card.If you have a Personal Credit Line, transfer as much of your credit card debt to this account as the interest payable is lower than Credit Cards (in most cases).Start paying more into the accounts with the highest interest rates.0 comments0"
