1,"Billy Ko, President - Investment Club at Singapore Institute Of TechnologyLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Jun 2019If you observe how Trump plays his cards - causing dips in the market through tarrifs then removing / delaying the tarrifs leading to rise in markets. He's a businessman, not a politician. He doesn't work on democracy but rather, adopting the mind of someone who places $$$ as priority. Given the above observations, I foresee market dropping further due to all these tarrifs at the moment but he'll soon either remove / delay the tariffs to get the market to rise back up.0 comments0"
