1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 10 Apr 2019Hey everyone! I'll list some thoughts I have here, mainly looking at some financials, business models and valuation for this stock.Business ProfileKeppel Corporation** **is a Singapore-listed industrial conglomerate, with operations in property, offshore and marine, infrastructure and investments. This business should be a conglomerate, since the business operations seem diversified. For FY17, the revenue from the segments seem more or less equal, with property, offshore and marine having similar revenues and investments having the smallest. However, in FY18, revenue from Infrastructure is more significant. FinancialsIncome StatementAlthough revenue for FY18 was more or less similar with FY17, operating profit of almost 20% due to lower D&A, staff costs and impairment loss on financial assets. Profit Before Tax was almost 3X higher because of the one-off financial penalty and related costs. This led to net profit being 5X higher.Balance SheetKeppel seems to possess strong short-term liquidity with a current ratio of more than 3, but much of its current assets come from amounts due from subsidiaries. Keppel Corp seems quite leveraged, with a D/E ratio of 1.5X and a Debt/EBITDA ratio of almost 25X.Cashflow StatementsA not so healthy sign is how working capital conditions had worsened, leading to Cashflow from Operating Activities becoming significantly lower. Improvements in cashflow from investing activities occured due to disposal of subsidiaries and associated companies. Lower cashflow from financing activities occured through lower issuance of debt and higher dividends being paid out.RisksConcentration RiskAs mentioned earlier, I believe concentration risk across sectors can be considered diversified. However I feel that the majority of revenue still comes from Singapore, so there are significant risks associated with our economic conditions here, such as demand for infrastructure, government policies and regulation and Singapore market, as reflected by their 3Y monthly Beta of 1.48.Capital Intensive BusinessMuch of Keppel's increase in cash balances can be attributed to their cashflows from investing activities. If you look at their breakdown, capital expenditures and investments in other entities seem to be a large part of Keppel's growth and acquisition strategy. Such significant cash outlay projections may be unsustainable, since Keppel's cashflow from operating activities have fluctuated. Working capital management thus are a big part of their operating strategy.0 comments5"
