1,"Joel TanLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 19 Jul 2019Not worth at all. Dun do it. you lose interest in the $50k or $100k u deposit in Unlimited saver account at 0.1% where you could place in a 2% account effectively causing you to lose $159 approximately a month. That means you have to spend around $5334 to earn the cash rebates just to be on par and not worse off. This is to prey on people who do not both to count opportunity cost foregone. Please correct me, if I am wrong.SH0 comments0"
