1,"Yanti Fauzi, Airside Officer at Changi Airport GroupLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 19 Jan 2019I used to be like you when I was applying for my CDP account 2 month ago. I waited for quite sometime for it to be approved, even end up calling the customer service for a few times and email them for the approval. Thinking that the mail might be missing haha.Patience, you will receive your letter of approval in about 1 month time after application via snail mail.  After that, you still need to wait for the DCS (Direct crediting service) after receiving your CDP approval. So happy waiting. 0 comments2"
