question,"Investments Trading Asked by AnonymousAsked on 23 Aug 2019Is it a good Idea to sell off all my shares in my current securities account and repurchase them in my new securities account, to lower the fees?This might sound like a big ""NO"" due to the fees for buying & selling. I now have 10 overseas shares with Phillips Securities and the fees are $240 pa (about 0.5% of what I paid for all the shares). I intend to keep long term. Hence I'm considering selling off my shares in phillips ($25/trade) and re-buying them in SCB ($10/trade) which has 0 custody fees. Transfer is $53.50 per share. Any advice / opinion?1 answerAnswerBump0"

1,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 26 Aug 2019Sounds like a good plan if transferring costs more.I don't see any other alternative here. If you intend to hold long term, then a one-time fee to move the shares to a cheaper custodian is definitely a wise choice.2 comments0"
2,"Charlot Ng27 Aug 2019Wouldn't selling and re-buying put you at a new entry price?Gabriel Tham26 Aug 2019Well, on paper it will be a new entry price. But in reality, it is the same. You bought A at $1. Now its $1.50. Paper gains $0.5.

Now lets say you want to shift it, sell and buy back. You sell at $1.50, buy back at $1.50. Net net you just lost the transaction commissions."
