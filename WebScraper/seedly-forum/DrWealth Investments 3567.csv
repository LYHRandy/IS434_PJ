1,"Luke HoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Jun 2018For the reasons that index investing is encouraged in large-cap, fairly-efficient markets, it serves opposite for fixed income. Bond ETFs are low cost and generally stable, but you can and should purchase bond funds that consistently beat these ETFs/indexes. FInding a fund that can do this is I daresay, extremely easy compared to finding a US Fund that can beat the benchmark of the SnP500, for example.â€‹Based on historical performance, you typically expect Bonds to perform at 2 - 4% annualized. You should up your expectations net of fees and consider active bond funds, which are more likely to perform at least from 4 - 6% net of fees with potentially higher Sharpe ratios. 0 comments1"
