Grand MasterAnswered 4w agoYes, you can, although the transfer is within 2 Singapore bank (I assume your ""domestic banks"" means in Singapore), it's actually done by international TT for USD. The charge is about USD $15.USD Cheque is cheaper (or even free). Get a USD cheque from DBS, for example, and you can bank into your USD account in SCB, OCBC etc.1 comment0"
2,"Kelly Trinh4w agoI was hoping to avoid the TT route, perhaps should have phrased the question as - is there a USD clearing/settlement system in place between Singapore banks that can be accessed through the internet banking... I believe there is something in place for USD in HK (but not exposure to general public through the internet banking seems to vary by bank).

For the cheque approach - that is what I use right now but it sure is a lot more of a a hassle :("
