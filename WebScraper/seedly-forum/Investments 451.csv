1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Apr 2019Hi Zann! Depending on your risk temperament and portfolio needs, you could either invest in physical gold or gold etfs! Advantages of Gold ETFs is its liquidity, transparency and low management fees. However, gold ETFs comes with a lot of counterparty risk, where the fund could possibly default on the agreement. Investing in Gold ETFs does not give you an exposure to gold. When you invest in a gold ETF you are buying the shares of the Trustee, that is you are a shareholder of the trust and not a gold holder. Whereas investing in physical gold gives you direct physical ownership. Owning physical gold not only provides an investment hedge against inflation and rising rates but also allows investors to have full control over their gold investment. TL;DR: If you are more risk-adverse, investing in physical gold is a better option.0 comments1"

3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Apr 2019For me I'll look into a sell to open position on gold futures. The premium decay is quite good and profits can be had rather quickly. Look into this if you have a bigger risk appetite to learn about options in the first place0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 09 Apr 2019You have to decide if you want to hold physical gold or invest in the price of gold through a fund.A gold ETF would be a easy way to access this market. SPDR has a popular one I believe. Some robos are using it as part of their portfolio.0 comments0"
