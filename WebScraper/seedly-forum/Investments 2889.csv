MasterAnswered on 17 Jan 2019If you are balking at the cost fee, imagine the amount you need to set aside for your account to really take advantage of his strategies. These are stock based if I recall correctly from the free preview (which I agree is really informative), hence a sizeable amount of funds may be required. There are alternative courses that cost less and require less of an amount for account funding out there. 0 comments0"
