1,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusAnswered on 02 Jul 2019I would say its ok, but I would phrase it as what kind of experience / pay grade are they looking for.The background was in 2010 when I left a local company and was looking for another job. One of the recruitment firms asked me to attend an interview (which I was somewhat not keen on).And it turns out the hiring manager's budget was about 20% lower than my expected pay, the location was in changi (i stay jurong), and I was expected to report to folks that might be less experienced than me. It was a horrible matchup.So I do think its a fair question, regardless of what HR thinks. If HR insists on underpaying vs the market, then at least you know what you are getting yourself into.Nowadays a lot of companies want to hire experienced, but pay up to 20+++% less (usually restructuring and adjusting the role to be one to two pay grades lower)0 comments1"

It might be a lil' sensitive too pose such a question if the underlying purpose is to use that as a negotiation for your salary. And furthermore, one must understand that within a role there are various grades as well hence the role isn't a determinant of your salary. Salaries should be negotiated based on your experience and what you can contribute to the company rather than what is budgeted.2 comments0"
3,"Question Poster02 Jul 2019Hmm cos as an applicant its usually recommended we specify a salary range to show we are flexible, so i specify like 10-20% above my current. But it always backfires since the HR picks the lower range, and cites hiring budget constraints. And they said since you specified 10-20%, 10% should be acceptable. I dont want to specify an even higher like 20-30% as it might seem i am asking for the sky.Billy Ko02 Jul 2019Yupp, I understand what you are going through. Perhaps you can indicate 20-30% higher but just indicate beside (Open to nego) If you indeed did impress / performed well during the interview, I'm certain HR / hiring manager would be open to negotiating your pay."
