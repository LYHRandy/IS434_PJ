question,"ETF Securities Investments Bonds Asked by AnonymousAsked on 21 Mar 2019For norm ETFs, it is made up of a basket of stocks. In the case of bonds, is that how bonds ETFs are like as well? If that is the case, isn't it problematic because bonds are constantly maturing? 1 answerAnswerBump0"

Most equity ETFs hold every security in their index. But that's usually not possible with bonds. Bond indexes often include hundreds, even thousands, of individual securities. Buying up all those bonds for an ETF's portfolio is not only difficult, but expensive. The cost to purchase thousands of bonds in illiquid markets, even those with minimal impact on the index, can quickly erode returns.0 comments0"
