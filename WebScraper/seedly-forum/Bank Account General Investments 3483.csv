question,"Bank Account General Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 17 Aug 2018How should I invest on my $500,000 savings?Currently I operate a small business. My savings is about $500k cash. I am 29yrs old. My HDB is 610k I still have a loan of 400k it’s a resale’s flat we purchase 6 years ago. It’s a  4-room flat about 18yrs old now city area. I am hoping to buy a landed but I am not sure if I should let go of my HDB or should I sell my HDB and buy a landed and down the road buy a freehold condo to rent out for investment purposes? Or I should keep the HDB to rent out I estimate I could rent out at least $2500 to $3500. My monthly payment is $2200. I am not planing to have kids so I need to have a stable income for my retirement. Please advise!1 answerAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 19 Aug 2018Hi Anon, I understand that property can be a very appealing investment option, but may I suggest that you look elsewhere.​In Singapore, property prices are not guaranteed to increase. You have to pay BSD and ABSD on your 2nd property purchase eating into the returns of your investment. Your capital is locked up with 0 flexibility unless you take an equity term loan on your property.​Maintenance is expensive and rental yield may not even cover your mortgage payments.​There are other ways to receive a passive income other than just rental.​Dividends from a equity and bond portfolioCoupons from a bondRental return from REITsProfits and proceeds from a businessBonuses from an annuity plan​You're still young as well. You should look for some growth potential from that money. I would suggest investing in a globally diversified portfolio that suits your risk profile. From your age a 70/30 Equity and Bond Portfolio may be ideal. You can gain 6-12% per annum on such a portfolio. Lower if taking the passive ETF route or higher if you take the active management route.​So in summary, buy a place to stay, but don't invest for growth or rental in Singapore. Just wayyyy to expensive.​Lastly, assets in old age become liabilities. You wouldn't want to be called up when you're 80 with your tenant tenant telling you the pipes burst. ​You would rather have a guaranteed source of income every single month to the point where you don't even know where to spend it on. There are other options for that. And now that's retirement.0 comments0"
