God of WisdomAnswered on 04 Jun 2019Your remaining 500k is giving you a guaranteed 2.5-4% return currently. It's a very good deal. At your age, you might not want to take so much risk and invest. You should consider looking at guaranteed products instead. What you may want to look at would be to complement your CPF Life payouts by getting another Annuity that will pay you a guaranteed stream of income for life. It's good to remain conservative with your retirement money, especially when you'll be needing it very soon. Look to preserve your wealth at this stage of life.0 comments3"
