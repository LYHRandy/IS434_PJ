Grand MasterAnswered on 12 Sep 2019Most Option sellers (or Option writers) I know are making decent money from selling options.I have been selling for 15 years, and in the first few years, due to lack of experience, have lost a few thousands here and then. Over the years I have fine-tuned the process and realised the key to profit is:- Don't be too greedy.Most options expired worthless, roughly 90%.So learn option selling, it's a good long term income source.0 comments2"
2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Mar 2019Considering that most options expire worthless, it's worth considering selling instead of buying. Selling gives more consistent income as compared to buying, where you need to be 100% right in your decision to make money. Whereas for selling options, as long as the stock price doesn't go beyond your strike at expiry, you keep the premium, the option position expires and you can start over. It's like being the insurer in the stock market, selling 'policies' and settling claims when necessary. But of cos I'll make sure that there are no claims coming my way. Even when they do, I'll deal with it and throw it out the window, and I'll just continue selling.The downside is if you are not sure what you are doing and you don't take proper risk management steps. Then your risk may be unlimited.If you want to start trading options, it's best to find a mentor to teach you as you'll learn faster and will know how to deal with loss making positions. Not to mention usually there will be discounted commissions with the broker.Hope this helps.0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 12 Mar 2019Hi there!Not exactly sure about the mathematical edge but here's a scenario to illustrate how people can potentially lose a lot of money writing (selling) options.In the case of a call option, the holder of the call option has the right, but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at the strike(specific) price on/before the expiry date of the option.Now imagine you just sold a call option of strike price $20 at $3 per call, and assuming you have insanely bad luck, the company becomes a target company of a M&A deal, and its share price skyrockets to $30, you are now obliged, as the writer of the call option, to purchase the stocks at $30 from the market and selling it to the holder of the call option at $20. Since there is technically no limit to how high prices might rise, your potential loss for selling call options is infinite.0 comments0"
