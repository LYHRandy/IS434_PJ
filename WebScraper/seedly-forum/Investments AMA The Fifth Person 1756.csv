WonderkidUpdated on 07 Apr 2019Hi Anonymous!Great question, I feel that besides asking how, what and how much, also consider WHEN to start investing.Investment, in terms of holistic personal finance, is for wealth accumulation which is crucial because you need lots of money to get married, pay off your house, buy a car, finance your children's education, and finally retirement (of course, this list of milestones is not exhaustive).The best time to start investing is after you have built up an emergency fund (3-6 mths of living expenses) and have cleared your debts (excluding mortgage), so this includes student loans if you have any. Paying off debt is not just good from a mathematical point of view, but being debt free gives you the freedom to invest without having to worry about whether your investment is more than your loan interest etc etc. Trust me, it feels a lot better to invest only after you cleared debts and all.Now, if you are debt free (no student loan) and have an emergency fund, than you might be ready. But remember, you still have to consider saving up for near term milestones like your engagement ring, wedding ceremony, house downpayment etc. But I would recommend learning more about investment and personal finance.Go around and talk with people in the industry but don't be pressured to buy anything! Just continue to learn, and of course be frank with whoever you are learning from. If you are learning from a banker or agent, just let them know you are just wanting to learn, some are generous enough to just share without pushing anything to you. This is important because you are unlikely ready to commit to a 20/30 year savings/investment plan just yet. So start learning first, if you want to trade, play small (10% or lower of your net worth) and learn from the best (Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett, Dave Ramsey, just to name a few).All the best and have fun!Kee Kuan0 comments2"

Don;t rush into investing straight away because you may make many unnecessary mistake. To invest in the stock market, having at least $3000 is a good start as anything lower will increase your brokerage fee percentage. If you don;t know which stock to invest, you can start off with index ETF. Then again, do remember to educate yourself first before any investment.0 comments0"

There are several ways to start investing. You can make use of sites like investopedia to learn more about stock investing. You should have a good understanding of fundamental and technical analysis. You should also be good with market research. You can begin with as little as $500 to $1,000. And please do not invest more than you can afford to lose.0 comments0"
