You may want to check out fundsupermart or Philip. I think they should be quite competitive in term of unit trust. 0 comments3"

Banks charge a fee as they're the one giving the recommendation.But also, buying unit trust is not a one time and forget thing. You use UTs as a means to build a sustainable balanced portfolio. And you'll usually use 3-6 funds to achieve global diversification and asset allocation.Instead of buying from a bank who may not be handling portfolio allocation and management, you can choose to DIY online or instead get from a Financial Advisor. An FA uses UTs to build portfolios, rebalance, adjust weightage in sectors based on market outlooks. That's a much better reason to pay a fee. 0 comments3"

Seems nobody answered your question or there seems to be a lean towards online since low fees!
So far I've invested into UT based on advice thru banks RMs. As part of the fees I get the following services my risk profile done, several ideas of my own challenged and spoken to the analyst team.filtered thru 100s then offered 3-4 UTs that have a track record of returns as per my risk appetite. access to their research team and insights on market trends advice by research team on when to sell off or retain Now this is a lot different than having to buy online based on my own reading and learning of something I'm not an expert in compared to research teams at banks and their fund mgrs.Hope this helps with some perspective.0 comments0"
