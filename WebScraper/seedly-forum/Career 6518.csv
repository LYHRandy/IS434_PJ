ProdigyAnswered on 21 Jan 2019Ask your boss to elaborate on what exactly needs to be improved and ask for examples so that you know what to improve and what mistakes to avoid. Other than that, practise like what everyone else suggested.0 comments0"

Record yourself while you're at it, then watch the video and review what can be done better! Do not criticise yourself because it will only think about negative thoughts. Instead, think of what can be improved, then try again!0 comments0"

If you keep presenting then the content becomes 2nd nature then you can focus on the presentation techniques 0 comments0"
