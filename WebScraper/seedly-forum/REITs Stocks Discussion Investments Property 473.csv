God of WisdomAnswered on 23 Sep 2019Apply through your ATM/internet banking, as others have said.However, whether you get an allocation or not is really down to luck. Unless the allocation strategy follows some past IPOs like FLT where everyone who subscribed got at least some allocation if not, it would probably be a pure ballot.(Disclaimer, I have not analyzed this one in detail, nor read the prospectus)1 comment6"

Grand MasterUpdated on 23 Sep 2019Maximising your chance and allocation of popular stocks on IPOA) For those IPO that are hugely popular and going to be oversubscribed, there is a strategy of maximising the chances of getting more stocks.1) Don't just apply for the number of shares you want, everyone will get under-allocated (if selected at all).Apply more than you want, because if you are selected, you will get a lower number anyway (this strategy will backfire if the IPO is not popular, but I guess you would have done your due diligence)2) Apply for 100,000 shares. If you have limited capital, go for 50,000This photo will probably explain why.These are what I learnt fromhttps://singapore-ipos.blogspot.com/2007/07/how-to-increase-your-probability-of-get.html I have been using these strategies in the past when the Singapore stock market was alive and bursting with excitement. Nowadays I have sold almost everything I have in SGX, including those gems I got from IPO.B) For those who still don't know how to apply for an IPO.1) Get CDP account (Seedly has a good article on CDP application https://blog.seedly.sg/step-step-guide-opening-stock-trading-brokerage-cdp-account-singapore/ )2) when IPO date is opened on 25 Sept 9 am, go to ATM or use your internet banking (go find Securities Application or something similar) of any local banks OCBC, UOB or DBS /POSB.You can apply online or via ATM, the application fee is only $2.Have great luck IPO-ing!3 comments3"
4,"See all 3 comments Cedric Jamie Soh23 Sep 2019Yeah. after a few IPO, u will realise that most popular IPO u only get very small percentage of what you applied.... maybe 10%? 
of course you must be sure that its really popular.. thats why I usually apply only on the last day of the IPO application hahahaa!MTMax Trimble4w agoWhen will we know the 'results' of how many % we will get?"
