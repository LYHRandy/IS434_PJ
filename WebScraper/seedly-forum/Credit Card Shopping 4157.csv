1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Jun 2018Just want to know your concerns over your credit score. Are you using it for a loan or something?​Based on what you describe, you technically have perfect credit score, since you have no outstanding liabilities with any bank.​So, to apply for a credit card to ""improve"" your credit score is not going to work. Applying for any credit card DO NOT improve credit score.​Instead, just keep being prudent and only apply for a credit card when you are in the working world.0 comments1"

WonderkidAnswered on 03 Jun 2018Get a credit card for miles/cashback/rewards - and that's about it. ​Other than that, if you are tracking your cashflow, and do not have any problem, you don't need to look for more complications. ​The less cards, the less worry. ​Hope it helpsPascal0 comments1"
3,Charmaine NgLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Jun 2018Agree.. Credit card does not improve credit score and with a credit card you may very well be more tempted to spend and land yourself in debt. Would recommend to apply for 1 credit card only to accumulate miles/earn cashbacks. You can head over here to read the reviews on some of the more popular cards!0 comments1

8,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 18 Sep 2018owning credit card does not improve credit score. Here's how to improve credit score: 1. Check credit report and rectify any mistake.Free check at: https://www.creditbureau.com.sg/available-options.html​2. Pay any cc bills on time/all the time in full (not partial or min).​3. Avoid applying for multiple new cc within a short period of timeSometimes a few new credit applications will push you from a responsible consumer to an unreliable one from a bank’s point of view. And every bank has a different set of requirements and criteria to satisfy.Whenever you apply for new credit facilities, it would put enquiries against your credit report. Many enquiries within a short period of time can have an adverse effect on your credit score.​For your information, “Previous Enquiries” are retained on your credit report 2 years from the date of enquiry. So it takes a long time before the effect wears off.​4. keep your credit active​But if you do not use your credit, the banks cannot assess it. If you have “insufficient credit activity”, there is very limited information such as credit applications or accounts status history to derive a score.​5. Commit to keep it simple and improve your credit score​default records stay on your credit report for 3 years upon full or negotiated settlement, and bankruptcy data is retained for 5 years from the date of discharge.​It is ok if you have made mistakes before. But if you want to see the light of the tunnel, you know you have to commit to the following in the long term:​Check your credit report annually and rectify if there is any mistakePay your bills on time, all the time and keep your balances lowAvoid multiple new credit applications within a short period of timeKeep your credit activeAnd your credit score will work out fine.​​Tips: Read this hack on getting highest credit score in SG​https://www.singsaver.com.sg/blog/how-to-get-aa-credit-risk-grade-in-singapore0 comments0"
