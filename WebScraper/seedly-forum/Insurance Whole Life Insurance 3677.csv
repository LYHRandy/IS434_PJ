God of WisdomUpdated on 04 Sep 2019Yes, you can get it for that amount, however, take note that it is group insurance, so you do not own the policy. Should the policy owner (MINDEF) decide not to work with the insurer, you will lose coverage.Also, the $1 million of cover is split into $500K Death/TPD and $500K personal accident. Should you pass on naturally, your payout would only be $500K.If you are still in your 20s, a simple personal term plan covering death/TPD can be obtained for relatively low premiums, covering you till around age 60. Maybe it won't be $312/year depending on your age, but it will still be affordable.3 comments6"

1) Yes, the risk is low, but not zero. Or, the alternate situation is that the insurer loses the contract. Aviva's contract with MINDEF and MHA is on a 3 year term renewable for another 3 years. They might chose not to renew the tender, or they mi... (more)Thelobang Thelobang04 Sep 2019Thank you Elijah.  If the focus is on BASIC insurance and how much to spend on this, then MINDEF & MHA group term life, personal accident and critical illness should be the most cost effective for most Singaporeans and their family members, including younger working people or younger parents around 25-30 years old who are becoming more aware of the need to build up basic insurance protection. Again, the risk of problems with MINDEF & MHA insurance policies will be extremely low as the Government of Singapore is involved. I have had this group policy for more than 20 ... (more)"

MasterAnswered on 07 Sep 2019The best is if you are able to secure premiums lower than Mindef Aviva Insurance. The first advice is always to get private insurance (be it term/whole life etc) and opt for Mindef Aviva later, when comparing private insurance, since death coverage is more expensive for private cover as you age.However, if your age is more than 30, the most cost-effective insurance is Mindef Aviva. For CI, most cost-effective may become private.As always, do shop around to get what you need, DYODD. Most of what I type is a guideline, and to be confirmed with Hard numbers.0 comments0"
4,"Brandan ChenLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 10 Sep 2019Firstly, what is your definition of overpaying?Secondly, premiums depend on quite a couple of factors: Age, Gender, Smoking Status, Health Status, and the type of plans you think best caters to your needs.In a nutshell, personal financial planning revolves around 4 key pillars:1) Health Insurance - cover hospitalisation bills, pre and post hospitalisation treatment and consultation2) Life Insurance - Provides income protection in the event of Death, Disability, and Critical Illness3) Retirement Planning - Consists of investments and savings4) Personal Accident CoverageAt the end of the day, the advisor should be able to explain to you the various types of options available to you to meet both your objective and BUDGET so that you do not think that you are over-paying!If you would like to find out more, I would suggest you speak to a financial advisor or myself.

5,"Thelobang Thelobang04 Sep 2019Thank you for your comments. Given that the median salary for recent graduates from ITE, polytechnics and universities is about $1700, $2350 and $3500 a month, not ""overpaying"" for BASIC insurance should mean that MINDEF & MHA group insurance is probably the lowest cost option to get basic insurance comprising of Term Life and Personal Accident, and also Critical Illness without impacting heavily on a person's monthly take home pay. For example, a 26-30 year old male can get $1.95 million of protection for $61 a month = $732 a year (1 mil term life, 600k perso... (more)Loh Tat Tian10 Sep 2019Hey. I feel neglected.
