1,"Dawn FionaLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I've been blogging since I was 12 and only started SGBB 4 years ago, a year after I graduated from journalism in university. I couldn't become a full-time writer because #AsianParents, so I needed an outlet elsewhere. It was only recently that I started accepting more sponsored posts...for the ones I would already have wanted to write about anyway (but no time / not too of my agenda. Money can push a topic to the top of my editorial agenda ðŸ˜‚). Having said that, 90% of the content I write are unpaid. I wish more brands would pay us to write, but the sad truth in Singapore is that even finance brands would ask us financial bloggers to write for free while paying a dozen IG influencers $1k+ for an IG post on the same which actually barely skirts the surface of the financial product or service la. Not gonna name names but people with eyes can see ðŸ‘€  why like that? I also dunno ðŸ˜‚ Would I still blog about personal finance if there were monetary incentives from it? Yes, definitely! And I think all the SG financial bloggers will say the same. Anyone who started out for the money in this space will soon find out that there isn't much ðŸ˜‚ we're not lifestyle bloggers you know. For a writer, a blogger, the biggest reward is in having an audience who are reading your words.3 comments10"
2,"See all 3 comments Leong Wen Fong28 Dec 2018Hmm, I don't blame them though. From the marketing point of view, only people who intentionally read finance blogs are the people who already have an interest. However, they would want to target those without knowledge/people they can spark interest in- and in this case, influencers would have more reachJames Yeo01 Jan 2019You make me want to go do IG liao.. LOL!"
3,"Joel SimLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 27 Dec 2018Disagree with Gabriel. That is one thought process and can't be said for all.Some of us actually create a blog to organise our thinking processes towards finances / other important aspects of our daily living.A blog creates a structure on how we categorise certain strategies or our way around it. Most of the finance bloggers actually know each other. We then exchange our different point of views and learn from each other. We sharpen our tools.Though some may use to to monetise, others have a different focus and the monetary aspect is a byproduct of good content and value from thought processes.0 comments6"
4,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 28 Dec 2018To be honest! I think these dudes and ladies are the 'White Knights' in this industry. Most of the content that they create - mostly charts and words will be highly useful and effective in helping most Singaporeans plan for their future. Financial bloggers (to me) are the most worth your time and effort opening up to read and learn, to figure out how they think and manage their money. Don't need to follow or not, just to learn and get perspective!As Fiona shared also, most instagram influencers (look good and often take nice pictures) but do not necessary have much 'liao' when it comes to the serious personal finance stuff.So to answer your question, support them, and especially both who are sponsored or not, because ultimately they all have to survive somehow haha. (unless they are backed by investors HAHA)At Seedly, we wanna create this environment where everyone can create their own content - just a discussion, quote, an answer a poll etc. :) You're never too early or late to start!Oh yeah, last fun fact: MileLion - Aaron just quit his day job to blog full time! 0 comments3"
5,"Ashley Wong, Financial Assistant at Multi Management & Future SolutionsLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 08 Jan 2019Nice question. I have been working on finance blogs from long. I do it because I love to write and my interest area is finance and trading. I am currently associated with a reputed financial advisory firm.Ofcourse, money is a priority. It would be difficult to work if my priorities are not taken care of. And I guess it is the same for all finance bloggers.0 comments0"

WizardAnswered on 27 Dec 2018Actually is the same for all bloggers/influencers.once u get many followers, u start to get sponsorships (PAID)then with many followers, u add a few banner ads to your site to generate some passive income.then as u become more popular, u get to mingle with other popular bloggers, which increases your user base even more.0 comments0"
