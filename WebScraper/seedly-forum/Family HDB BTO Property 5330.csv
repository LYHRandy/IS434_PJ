question,"Family HDB BTO Property Asked by AnonymousAsked on 08 Oct 2018Parents getting divorce, should I take over and co-own Marine Parade hdb as a couple with my Mum or bto with BF? The location is good and Thomson East Coast line is right at the door step(open 2023)?House valued at 800k w/ 60k balance loan under dad. From divorce, Mum get $500k, $171k go to dad cpf as well as any balance. BF & I are considering to take over balance of the flat loan & pay back my father(300k) & continue staying there to enjoy the convenience and potential capital appreciation of the property when mrt open. My mum and Boyfriend gets along pretty well and he doesn’t mind staying there. If we were to take over the balance loan, will there be any grants we can use?3 answersAnswerBump1"

1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Personally, I would think the BTO option would make the most sense... Financially and practically.​Can your mum continue to own the flat as a single occupier while you guys help to pay for her balance as well? Or is she able to fund it on her own?​And actually the BTO balloting takes a long time. I personally have tried it 7 times before getting a flat in Ubi (on my 8th try) because it is a mature estate. ​For this: ""If we were to take over the balance loan, will there be any grants we can use?"" I don't think there are any ones that I have seen before... so unlikely... unless it's like a purchase of a resale flat? But that is usually from another party... not family related. ​If it's a resale purchase, can use a variety of grants that you see here: https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/resale/schemes-and-grants/cpf-housing-grants​Let us know anonymously if you have any more questions below, our content team can go research about this more in detail as well.

2,"Question Poster08 Oct 2018Question poster here. Unfortunately Mum is unable to keep the flat with the $500k because $300k of the $800k(if we sell it) has to go back to my father and she is not working so unable to take loan to pay it off. At the same time, I’m planning with my future husband about our housing. We thought about applying for BTO which won’t be ready in a few years. In the meantime, either myself or as a married couple(not sure if it’s possible) to be co-owners of the house and we will pay off the remaining $300k with loan. (Mum contribute $500k, me with my husband to contribute $300k). ... (more)Kenneth Lou09 Oct 2018Ah understand your situation. Unfortunately I know for sure that you are unable to do the second strategy... to be co-owners of the current house. As you will not be able to apply for a BTO (when applying you will need to declare if you are also owners of any other property in SG) BTOs are only for first time home buyers because the prices of BTO are alot lower than market rate and also we get grants for BTOs... Yup!"
3,Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 29 Nov 2018BTO with your BF is a better option. Reason being you could fetch a higher resale value since the MRT is just right at the door step. This would also help to resolve most of your financial issues. Do remember HDB flat is valued at $0 once it reaches 99 years old unless your flat is selected for SERS. Just my humble opinion.0 comments0
4,"As DfLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 08 Oct 2018If you take over as co owner, it's not easy to withdraw your name in the event things don't work out and you want to get your own place.Even if you want to help your mom fund the place, a possible option is to transfer from your cpf to hers, or being a guarantor for her loan instead. 0 comments0"
