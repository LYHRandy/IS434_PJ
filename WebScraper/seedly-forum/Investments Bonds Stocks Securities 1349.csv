1,"Gibson JunxunLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 11 May 2019Personal preference, I’ll go for stocks for its dynamism in the market.Bonds in general are more towards wealth preservation. At the start of the transaction, you‘ll know what would be the end value of your investments but your money will be stucked throughout the duration of the bond. A lot of opportunities and events can happen from the time you transact to the end of your bond period.Stocks, on the other hand, would require slightly more effort in monitoring and nurturing your portfolio.but in return you get more flexibility with your money and potentially higher returns over time as the money you invested in it is used as the same purpose as to how your money would be used if let says the company issues a bond.Cheers to a wonderful investing journey ahead!0 comments0"
