2,"Tee Hon EngLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 04 May 2019Hello.Personally, I use https://stocks.cafe/wall to track my investments. Good user interface.You will be able to track your P&L (value and percentage it grows with your principal) along with P&L + Dividends.As I use Maybank KE prefunded account, my dividends are credit back to the investment account for the next deduction.Thus, I will only track the P&L if I have intention to sell (remember to consider if there are fees involved into the P&L). Also, dividend when my dividend per year exceeds the yearly invested amount.0 comments0"
