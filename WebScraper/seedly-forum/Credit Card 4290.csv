MasterAnswered on 07 Oct 2018Currently boc elite miles World mastercard. 5 miles per dollar for foreign currency spend, 2 miles per dollar for local spend until 31 Dec this year. The base rate is 1.5 miles per dollar for local spend and 3 miles per dollar for foreign currency spend. Long queue for processing though. I'm still waiting for mine..
