Just search for 'RMRB' (this is the bond's symbol) in any brokerage account and you should see it!As for your second question, you'll need to evaluate your needs. Are you satisfied with the payout? Can you take more risks? etc.​There are also quite a lot of financial bloggers who have talked about the bond. They can be found easily by googling!​Good luck!0 comments0"

I think you have to ask yourself that question and need to know your investment portfolio profile. eg if you are focusing on bond mix, there are also bond funds and retail bonds in the market for you to consider.​There are also comparable products in the market which have a similar yield and profile to the Astrea IV bonds also :) ​​0 comments0"
