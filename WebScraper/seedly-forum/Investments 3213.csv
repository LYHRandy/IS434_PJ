1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019It's a different share of one bond each application. Thus, you'll be having a part of 120 bonds over 10 years if you apply and get it every month. 2 comments1"
2,"Question Poster22 Oct 2018I see. That means ONE bond is issued every month (as opposed to what I thought before of 1 bond = 1 transaction of X amount by 1 pax. Sorry, greenhorn here).
Could you please elaborate on ""you'll be having a part of 120 bonds over 10 years if you apply and get it every month"" please?
For example, If I make a $1000 purchase on a bond on Feb2019 AND Feb2028 each, will I get back my $2000+int on Jan2029 (tenor period from Feb2019)? Or the bond purchased on Feb2028 will mature on Jan2038 and I'll only get that $1000+int then?Hariz Arthur Maloy22 Oct 2018Each purchase would have a 10 year maturity. Feb 2019 will get in 2029. And Feb 2028 in 2038. Different bonds. Also different rate of return. "
