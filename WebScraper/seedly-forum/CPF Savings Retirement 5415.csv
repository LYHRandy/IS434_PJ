question,"CPF Savings Retirement Asked by Weng FaiAsked 3w agoWhat happens when my MA and SA have reached the BHS and FRS respectively?I understand that in my monthly contribution, my MA will spillover to SA, and if SA has reached the limit, it will spill to OA. But what about my SA? Does it still get credited or it will also spill over to OA? Thank you, and sorry if this question has been asked before, but I couldn't find a relevant answer...1 answerAnswerBump0"

If SA has hit ceiling, the MA money that would have gone to SA goes to OA. Same for the MA interest, it spills to SA if MA is full, if not it goes to OA if SA is full.However, contributions that were meant to go to SA will always be credited there, regardless of your SA amount. SA interest will also always be credited to SA.3 comments4"

So if your compulsory contribution was $27740 from employment, and you contributed $10K voluntarily, the $10K is still split across 3 accounts and follows the basic rules mentioned above.WFWeng Fai3w agoThank u so much! :D"
