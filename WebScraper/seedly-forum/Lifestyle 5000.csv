1,"Luqi LiewLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Corkage waiver - Important for hard liquor you're bringing inAdditional night stay for wedding suite - Usually possible if you're doing weekday.Additional room for brother and sisters / relative - can sometimes convert to future stay if you don't use it on actual day.Changes in food menu - Can ask for better fish etcAdditional bottles of wine - Usually 1 per tableWedding shows usually give pretty good discount. For us, we got a free buffet meal for 8 during weekday / 4 during weekend when we sign up at a wedding fair through their lucky draw.It's important to consider your Ang Pow rate for friends and families if you are worried about paying too much out of pocket.Sometimes hotel raise rates for next year, so it might be good to ask and lock in the rates with some time to consider. Also ask if they will be at any wedding fairs soon.1 comment4"

3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Wait for hotel open house or wedding fairs where your shortlisted hotel is participating in. Best its the latter, as you can compare among different hotel packages at the same time. You can find the best deals offered among the hotels, the perks etc. Decide what perks you want, then go to the shortlisted hotels and ask for it at the budget you have. Unable to fulfill? Move to the next one. My package back in 2015 included free flow wine, 1 barrel beer and 2nd night at Grand Copthorne Waterfront for a wedding lunch. 1 comment3"

5,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I have been to 2 years of wedding show. Pretty much they give some special wedding flavours or add on. Decide on your budget and number of tables first. Then look for the hotel. I find it easier so that we do not get disappointed if the hotel we wanted cannot host it. No remorse on hotels we cannot even choose.But if you are the type to want a particular hotel, then you will need to meet their requirement.For add-ons, have to do some comparison for yourself. Some gives 2 wedding favours, some 3 depending on the number of tables you are having. (hint why table number is important).1 comment1"
