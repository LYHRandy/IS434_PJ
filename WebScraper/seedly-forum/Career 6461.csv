MasterAnswered on 11 Mar 2019I think this highly depends on your course, as well as the industry you apply for!I have friends from FASS drawing a starting pay ranging from $3000 to $4200 a month.Note that my sample size is rather small; there are probably fresh grads from FASS drawing a lower/higher starting pay!0 comments0"
