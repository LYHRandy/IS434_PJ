question,"Lifestyle Savings Bank Account Credit Card Asked by Zhang XiangAsked on 08 Dec 2018Is UOB SmartPay worth it?I am considering using UOB Smartpay to split up my payments into installments.It's not that I do not have the cash, just that I do not want to pay such a big lump sum amount at one shot.However, it comes with a fee, and for 12 months the fee is 5%. If the amount is $20000 the fee would be $1000, which would be a considerable amount.Should I use the UOB Smartpay to split up the payments but end up paying more, or just pay the lump sum and end up with less money in my bank account?1 answerAnswerBump1"

1,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019If you can afford it then why not go with cash. You can look into different cashback promotions by other cards depending on your type of purchase. UOB SmartPay has a 9.5% effective interest rate for 12 month period in addition to the 5% processing fee, meaning you'll have to pay addtional 3k just to extend the paying period.3 comments0"
2,"See all 3 comments Lok Yang Teng09 Dec 2018My bad, the EIR is for the one off payment. The account doesnâ€™t seem bad, esp useful if you have to buy multiple big ticket items. It seems like maximum number of translation is 5 (https://www.bankbazaar.sg/credit-card/uob-0-percent-interest-instalment-payment-plan.html?ck=Y%2BziX71XnZjIM9ZwEflsyDYlRL7gaN4W0xhuJSr9Iq4a%2F9e0Il%2B3Wm6RG6QA%2FONi&rc=1)Zhang Xiang09 Dec 2018I was looking at the same site that you shared, and it says that ""SmartPay transactions are not eligible for Reward Points (UNI$)"". This means that for the $20000 transaction not only do I need to pay additional $1000 administrative fee, I would also lose the reward points for the transactions, which seems to be quite a big loss... Maybe it is still better to just pay off everything in one payment."
