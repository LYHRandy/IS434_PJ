If you are considering Citibank's DCP (debt consolidation plan) right now; I assumed that you already have debts of >12 months salary? I wouldn't recommend you to go for DCP first; for few reasons.DCP works by consolidating all your existing bank debts into DCP (Citibank pays it off for you and now you owe them only). The interest rate is about 10%/annum, vs 24-30% credit card interests rate.This is not attractive; because if you go for CCS DMP (debt management plan), you could get single digits interest rates. The % rate now may not seems immediately applicable to you, but interest rates compile quickly. For DMP, if your plan is approved it'd mean that CCS has ran through with you your income vs expenditures; given you the necessary advices and negotiated with the banks for you to make payments comfortably.The plan does not eradicate roots of the problem. In the first place what are the causes of your debts? Lifestyle choices or circumstantial? Enrolling yourself into DCP helps short term but does not help you to understand what went wrong and while DCP gives you a month of credits to use ""for emergency uses""; honestly you're just going to rack up debts again if you don't know what went wrong and how you can make wiser decisions.My personal experience with Citibank is just bad. I had a study loan long time ago and even though it was paid; I received letter of non-payment and it's difficult to get hold of their loan officers to make things right. This gives me impression that they are great when signing up; and MIA when you need them most. Nono.Lastly, I suggest you sign up for a infotalk at CCS if not already. The talk helps you to understand the differences of DMP, DCP and few other alternatives which you may explore. Also, you only furbished more details if you think you need CCS help after the talk. They will run through the process with you as well.https://www.ccs.org.sg/e-submission/index.php/member/site/info_registerI came upon a write-up on the process which I think is useful for people new to CCS DMP.https://unhypemydebts.wordpress.com/2015/07/14/steps-taken-towards-dmp-debt-management-program/All the best!5 comments0"
