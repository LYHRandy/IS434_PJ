Well at that age you can only go for private property. And that's a verg high quantum and if you would have only started working in SG after you graduate, you may not have a lot of money in OA to leverage on. Plus you'll be giving up the chance to buy a BTO. I wouldn't suggest buying an investment home at all. Not here. It'll make more sense to invest in the markets or if you really want physical property, look to Bangkok or Vietnam properties. 0 comments0"
