5,"See all 4 comments Ang Yee Gary18 Feb 2019It also has 0.12 percent annual feesYixiong Chang18 Feb 2019Oh, that is the custodian fees for stocks/etf/bonds. You will be holding stocks as well? may i ask what will be your expected trade volume? It might not be worth trading since your volume is so small. IB only requires 10usd worth of commission to be incurred each month. If u trade 2-3contracts round trip a month would already be close to 10usd. "
