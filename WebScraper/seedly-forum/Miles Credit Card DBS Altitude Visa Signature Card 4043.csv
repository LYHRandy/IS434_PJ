question,"Miles Credit Card DBS Altitude Visa Signature Card Asked by AnonymousAsked on 03 Aug 2019Can I stack the miles earned on my miles credit card with the miles earned on the KrisPay app?Hi I just saw that we can use the KrisPay app to earn miles as well! Does anyone know if I were to do so (e.g. at a merchant that offers 2 mpd), and I make the payment via a miles credit card as well (e.g. the credit card earns me 1.2 mpd), does that mean I will get the 3.2 mpd in total? Also, if say i use DBS Altitude where the miles ‚Äúdon‚Äôt expire‚Äù, will the miles earned via KrisPay expire? And if so, how long will the validity be?2 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 11 Aug 2019Answer is yes. I am going to break up your questions into a few parts.For a merchant that offers miles via krispay, at a rate of 2mpd, you earn 3.2 mpd if you pay via cards that earns 1.2mpd, or 3.5mpd, if you pay via BOC Elite Miles. Basically, it is 2mpd + the base rate for whichever card you are using. The only difference is that 2mpd goes to your Krispay app, which you should transfer over to your Krisflyer account within 7 days from the transaction. Miles, once transferred over to Krisflyer, has a 3 years validity.The 1.2, or 1.5, or whatever the base rate is, goes to your credit card points/miles, which is then subjected to whatever expiry date the bank sets.Confusing? Let me use an example. The merchant, We Need a Hero, offers 2mpd when you use Krispay app to earn miles. Let say you spend $50 with them. So you pay via DBS Altitude Card and earn 60 miles (1.2X$50). These miles are kept in your DBS credit card account, which never expires. You then open up the Krispay app, enter the amount you paid, generate a QR code for the merchant to scan. After scanning, you earn 100 (2X$50) Krispay miles. Within 7 days, transfer these 100 Krispay miles at a 1:1 ratio to your Krisflyer account. The 100 miles that are transferred over will then be valid for 3 years.So in total, you earn 160 miles, of which 60 is in your DBS account, which nevers expire, and 100 is in your Krisflyer account, which expires in 3 years. And the mpd is 3.2 (160/50)Article for reference:  https://milelion.com/2019/03/06/finally-krispay-allows-you-to-earn-krisflyer-miles-at-selected-merchants/

Credit cards have exclusion of payment to top up another payment account. You need transfer krispay miles to krisflyer miles within 7 days. Then it will be 3 years expiry.4 comments0"
