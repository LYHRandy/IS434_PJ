3,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusAnswered on 26 Jun 2019Endowment and ILP policies. I thought it would be a good savings instrument, then I realized the insurance cost was very high for coverage I didnt want.I subsequently found it more financially attractive to just do minimum sum top-up, and SRS for tax reliefs and better returns.Last year I found that my own rate of return was a lot better than the fund in ILP, and I stopped the monthly premiums. On average, I found that my transaction costs were lower than the fund, I was sgd denominated whereas they changed the fund from SGD to GBP, and I still continue to beat the fund manager on YTD, 1 yr, 3 yr returns measures.0 comments1"

WizardUpdated on 26 Jun 2019Geez there’s probably so many things that will be in my list:random shirts and clothes (once in awhile)recently some sports gear which I’ve been trying to clear on CarousellProbably want to flip it around and answer it from another perspective, what do you feel you should spend money on:Family (one big one for me is food, and good food, because life is too short for regrets and you never know when is your last meal with someone you really treasure)Health (last year I tried to lose some pounds. Keyword: Tried)Experiences (Holidays! And both short and longer ones, because at the end of the day through the years, work can be fun but holidays are usually highlights of our journey here on earth. The exceptional bright spots)Hobbies (coffee is a big one for me, i spent a ton on getting the best in house barista machine)1 comment0"
