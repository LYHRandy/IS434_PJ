question,"Insurance Asked by Desmond ChikAsked on 10 Aug 2019There are many early stage critical illness in the market nowadays. Is it possible for Seedly to conduct a research on this and share your opinion? Thank you.?I am looking to purchase an early stage CI. However, I just found out that there are quite a few with different features e.g. number of illness, how early the stage is, multiple claims for same illness and/or different illness, etc. In addition, I am not really able to determine whether I need one early stage CI although I ""feel"" that it would be good to have before I retire.Hence, it would be great if you are able to share your opinion. Thanks.2 answersAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 10 Aug 2019You can decide to speak to an Independent Financial Advisor like myself who can show you a comparison between 6+ insurers.Other than that, you can also refer to this article:  https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion/navigating-critical-illness-plansHowever, Tokio Marine and Singlife's plans are not highlighted in the article.On the need of ECI coverage, I strongly feel that it is important because it covers all stages of Illness and if you're dilligent and go for regular checkups, if anything does come up, at least you find it early and I give you the money required to stop working and focus on getting the treatment you deserve to recover before it gets worse.0 comments2"
