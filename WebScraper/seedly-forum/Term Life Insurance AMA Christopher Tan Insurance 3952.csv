ProdigyUpdated on 06 Jun 2019I wouldn't say they are of a higher priority as opposed to general CI, which would be the protection product I would recommend before a female-specific CI.However, there are perks to having a female-specific CI plan:Full medical checkupsAdditional support and post-surgery benefits to help ease your recovery process and confidence due to the highly unwelcome experienceWhat is your current CI coverage?

This is because of the the free health checkup that comes with it. It's not also necessarily because of saving money, but more of the fact that you are reminded to go every year if not wasted.This makes sure that if anything were to come up, you find out early and can get treated before it gets worse.All the female specific plans end at age 65. But for general CI (which also covers female CI), I would recommend either Whole of Life or until life expectancy age, which is 85 for females. Also another pro to the female specific plans that are not in general CI would be the female surgeries benefit for masectomies and other reconstruction benefit which I've told helps in confidence and morale after experiencing such a traumatic experience.I've been speaking extensively about this since August last year, and could help you understand in clearer detail why you can choose to take or ignore this. 0 comments0"
