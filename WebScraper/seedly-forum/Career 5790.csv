question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 29 Nov 2018I work at a childcare, but the job isn't as expected. My boss is hard to deal with, my co-teacher left, leaving me to handle the whole class. I love the kids,but really want to quit. What should I do?Basically, other than teaching, I'm also cleaner, administrator etc. I also don't want to abandon the children under my care, and I haven't found a new job yet.2 answersAnswerBump1"

While I understand that you love the kids, you still have to think about yourself. If you grow resentful of the job, eventually it will show as well.Do look around at other options! You could still work in the childcare industry, but in a more friendly and supportive environment! :)0 comments0"

You can also try to speak to your boss about the crazy workload, alternatively ask for a pay raise perhaps, considering the extra work you are doing. But if it doesn't feel right, there's no point pressing on in an unappreciative and toxic environment. Time to start looking out and make your exit soon.0 comments0"
