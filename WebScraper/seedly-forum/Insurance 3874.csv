God of WisdomAnswered on 09 Apr 2019You still have 100% cover from the first dollar with your existing rider. I suggest sticking to that until the forced change in 2 years.You may save on some premiums now, but the 5% Co pay can be quite a lot if you get hospitalized in these next 2 years.0 comments1"

RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Since you have signed it 2 weeks before 1st April 2019, means you will be automatically switch to the new rider (Enhanced Care Rider) from 1st April 2021. I suggest you stick to the current plan you're having.The main differences between old riders (Basic + General Care Riders) allows you to make 100% claim where the new rider (Enhanced Care Rider) allows you to make 95% claim which you will need to fork out a 5% Co-Insurance payment (Medisave). Please note that the old and new riders' premium are also different, new rider will be much more cheaper than the old one.Hope this helps you in your questions.2 comments0"
