2,"Thaddeus Tan18 Apr 2019Hi Gabriel, I think $100 is okay but if I can definitely put in more I will. that's the part I'm unsure of, how much is too much? I want to put in as much so as to maximise returns but at the same time have enough to go about my daily activitiesGabriel Tham18 Apr 2019There is no too much. There is only how much you are able to or comfortable to put in. Calculate how much are your daily expenses, and future expenses like student loans, BTO, renovations, etc

After deducting all current expenses and potential future expenses, you get to decide, save, invest or spend the extra."
