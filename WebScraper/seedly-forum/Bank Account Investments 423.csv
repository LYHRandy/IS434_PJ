Grand MasterAnswered 3w agoCurrently, DBS Digiportfolio is only opened to DBS Treasure customers, and the funds are all unit trusts. I don't really like it as its the standard usual unit trusts available everywhere. I don't even know if the sales charge I paid is really the lowest that my banker said he got for me.ETF funds for DBS Digiportfolio would only be released on Nov 2019, I am really looking forward to that!0 comments0"
