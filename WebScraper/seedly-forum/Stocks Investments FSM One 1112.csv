1,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019When you open the custodian account, it is in your name. It is safe plus you have no choice. Shares need to be stored somewhere, even CDP is a custodian.3 comments1"
2,"See all 3 comments Gabriel Tham26 May 2019I recommend u sign up for the different brokers and try out the platform which one u like and easy to use. As for fees, all of them are very competitive, about $10 a trade for stocks. IB more for frequent trades because of the monthly fee, either u hit the commission or have 100kJohn Smith26 May 2019Many thanks!"
