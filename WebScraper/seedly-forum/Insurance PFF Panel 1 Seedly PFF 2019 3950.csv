1,"Yeo Kee Kuan, Financial Consultant at Finexis Advisory Pte LtdLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Great question JQ Chen, rarely do we think about the difference in purchasing from multiple insurer compared to just one insurer!The benefit of splitting your coverages between insurers is mainly for diversification (in case one insurer goes bankrupt etc) and to maximise the government's Policy Owner's Protection Scheme!Under this scheme, our life insurance policies are insured up to $100,000 per life assured per insurer by SDiC (governed by MAS). Meaning, if you bought a $200,000 term life plan from insurer X, you only are insured up to $100,000 by SDiC. But if you had bought $100,000 term life plans from insurer X and Y each, you will be insured up to $100,000 per insurer i.e. $200,000.The cons is inconvenience of applying for two plans and of course, it would likely cost you more to split the plan between two insurer (logic: cheaper when you buy in bulk).Find out more about SDiC and the Policy Owner's Protection Scheme at:https://www.sdic.org.sg/public/pp_scope_of_coverage3 comments0"
2,"See all 3 comments Yeo Kee Kuan23 Apr 2019Thanks for the comment! Sum assured is the coverage you are paying for i.e. If you are buying a $1 mil term life plan, your sum assured is $1 mil. Surrender value (only applicable to plans with cash value) is the amount you will receive should you surrender the plan at a specified time.Loh Tat Tian25 Apr 2019""Under this scheme, our life insurance policies are insured up to $100,000 per life assured per insurer by SDiC (governed by MAS).

When that happens, they don't necessarily have to be from the same insurer as it often depends on what's available or on promotion then as well. Eg I increased my (and my husband's) term coverage by almost double recently because we now have a child who's financially reliant on us. We looked at how much our dependents (we single-handedly support 5 dependents in total), how much they would need if something were to happen if we are no longer around, and added a new term policy to cover that difference.0 comments0"
