1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 06 Mar 2019I think Gabriel and Zann really hit the nail on the head with their concise answers. However to add on- although their advice applies to 90% of investors, certain investment strategies comes to mind that might not be so clear cut.For example, a momentum investor would judge if markets are underreacting to a piece of positive information, or overeacting to negative information- of which then the investor would decide to buy in.  Therefore that would really depend on when the news came out- be it post market or during market hours.Swing/Day traders also capitalize on fast reaction to news and tend to trade close to opening hours to ride swings fully. However such trades are tricky and is definitely not something I would recommend to the average investor.0 comments2"
