1,"Dawn FionaLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 14 Aug 2018Depends on you! For me, I focus on skills and experience. What do I want to learn? What job will give me that? In the early days of my career, salary was secondary - in fact, I graduated with higher credentials and an experienced portfolio than many of my peers, but accepted a lower starting pay for my first job than most of them, because learning > money to me back then.Of course, today I value and look for different things, more intangible ones. How's the company culture like? Do they value my work and contributions? Do they micro-manage? How are their KPIs measured and is it fair? Who will be my boss and how is she / he like? (having a good boss is VERY important). Will the pay be enough to feed my family and save for the future? Etc. 0 comments2"
2,"Leong Wen FongLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Aug 2018I believe that there is no one answer to your question. Everyone's value system is different. When I started looking for a job, I wanted to learn more about Fintech, and experience to me, was more important than salary. So I prioritized according to the industry, and gave more allowance to a lower pay.​Another person might be carrying a bigger financial burden (eg. supporting family, paying off loans, paying for studies), then the pay would take a much higher priority than his interest.​There are suveys done however, that good bosses retain employees better than pure passion or the high salary of a job! So just something to think about!0 comments1"

Do something that you like, and learn to make money from doing that. Because you like the work, you are more likely to become very good at it, and eventually make a lot of money from it. I believe most successful people use this model. ​The average people unfortunately, dream of their retirement because they hate what they do. They thinnk when they are eventually financial independent, they can finally do what they like. This model usually don't work. Because the average guy doing what they hate don't  usually achieve financial independent before 60. So they will be spending their whole working life doing things they don't like.​Do what you like, and you will be retired from age 25!0 comments0"
7,"Charmaine Ng, The Code Breaker at @ Every Chye Peng StallLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Aug 2018Hi, a few questions to ask yourself first. What are you looking for? Is this your first job or are you bored in your current job? Otherwise, are you looking to try something new in terms of job scope or industry?​When going for first job it's always better to be in a place where you can grow. Money is probably secondary at this point since it is all about the learning experience and skills to takeaways. When at a more experienced level; money and title comes into the picture because you're probably at the stage for marriage and family commitment too. At different stages people have different needs so it really depends on you (or perhaps you can give more context).​Most importantly is at every job you do you learn something and develop a new skillet be it hard or soft skills to keep yourself valuable.​Hope this helps!0 comments0"

And work out how much money you need. You'll need to find work that can provide money that you need too! 0 comments0"
