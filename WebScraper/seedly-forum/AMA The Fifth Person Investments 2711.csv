Some people here called it sales that you can get discounted price for a good company that usually dont sell so cheap unless recession and so on. There must be some companies whose fundamentals are solid and can tank through bad times, you need to do your research if you want to stock pick the good ones.0 comments0"

I am more of a bottom up approach investor by buying good companies. By the way, there are a lot of good companies in Japan that compound more than 10% excluding dividend for the past 10 years.0 comments0"

MasterUpdated on 21 Feb 2019I think its the opposite really, unless you think Japan's just gonna stand around twiddling their thumbs and feeling sorry for themselves.Hate to be a Buffett cliche, but be greedy when others are fearful and vice versa.If you'd like to consider a market beating fund from Japan for diversification, do let me know. Current yield despite last year's 16% drop is still 9%+ annualized net of fees.https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
