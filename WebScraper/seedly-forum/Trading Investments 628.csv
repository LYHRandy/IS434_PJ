Because if you short a CD cum dividend counter, you the shorttist will PAY the dividend amount.If you long, you get the dividend. If you short, you pay the dividend amount to the broker. So if you think you can earn from the drop in XD, think again. And there is no guarantee that XD, the stock price drops.0 comments1"
