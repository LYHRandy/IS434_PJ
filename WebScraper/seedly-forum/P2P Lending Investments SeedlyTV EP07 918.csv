1,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusAnswered on 20 Jun 2019There's two different questions and not much background info. Low capital is only one part and there could be a ton of other factors that influence the decision.Is 1k all you have? Do you owe money? Do you need to use the 1k if you need to buy food or a new hp? Do you have emergency funds?The second part is investing and which tools / instruments / platforms. What is your risk level, and time horizon if you invest all of the 1k?If you have no emergency funds and would actually need to use the 1k if you need to buy textbooks or a new hp, then the best advice is prob do nothing and keep it as emergency reserve.Between p2p and other investments, it depends.on your comfort and risk tolerance. Can you take it if the p2p loan defaults and you lose all or some of the money?If you get invested in index or shares, can you go long term and not withdraw the 1k for a while? Because there are fees to buy or to sell, and with 1k, the fees will be a high % of your capital, and you might not get good returns after deducting the applicable fees. And index or shares will take some time before the compounding shows good results....0 comments1"

WonderkidAnswered on 19 Jun 2019Hey there, so I'm in the same boat as you actually, started off with about 2k in May 2019, then threw in abit more after working and getting paid.I'd say nothing wrong with buying stocks with low capital! Yes the commission will bite your ass but that is only in the short term, if you are planning to invest for the long term, just get in there and start learning more about investing. Learn what is your actual risk appetite, can you stand watching 10% of your portfolio disappear in a matter of days or weeks?
Personally I invested in the STI ETF for 2 months and decided to sell them off as I feel like I could do more with the money I put in, but one man's trash is another man's treasure! There is no right or wrong way to invest, just stick to what you are comfortable with!Good luck with your investing journey man !0 comments1"

ProdigyAnswered on 27 Jun 2019Just do it if you want to but whatever you do, be prepare to lose that amount.Do your own research before going truly jump inIf you are planning to buy stock, I would against buying individual stocks, due to potential high cost of entry in comparison with 1k. It will take a longer time to offset the commision fees. Furthermore, the diversification is very limited. Instead, I would strongly advise buy etf (STI or go into robo-advisors). How? split $50-$100 over a year. Avoid putting a lump sum. WHY?You are well-diversified by buying the above instrument and through dollar-cost averagingThe fee to start is lowETF serves as a good core for you to start your investing and start researching more about stocksIn regard to p2p lending, it does have its own advantage of shorter term loan, from as lower as 30 days to longer than a year. This is such that you can plan out to withdraw anytime you need. Of course, I would strongly discourage you to do so as this defeats the purpose of investing.How you go about P2P lending?I suggest you first research and choose one that you trust the most or suits your needs or level of confidence. Start by putting the minimum sum  and 5 - 10 loans. Familiarise with the platform. If you dislike the idea of p2p lending, you can withdraw anytime. If you want to continue, start planning a game plan and follow strictly to it. For example, ensure that you have X amount (ie $200) so that you can withdraw it out anytime. Or set the minimum number of loan you provide. How most people play is put in the minimum sum with auto-invest and stay true to that. Often, opt-out if you are uncomfortable with the loan. In my opinion, P2P lending do give you the necessary flexibility.0 comments0"

Meanwhile, the highest lowest risk highest returns Investment you can do is:Sign up for one or few class in your field with exam that gives you a professional body recognize certificate. Combine with skillfuture $500 credits if you have yet to use. Google all the job boards, see the next level jobs of what you do and the salary and look for the certificate that needed, usually those with professional bodies and exam with membership that needs to maintain. With that , you upkills and can gain higher pay employment that you get to enjoy for long, plus increase incomes means able to save more to invest in the future. That would be the best investment with the highest returns and lowest risk! Cheers ðŸ˜ƒðŸ‘Œ0 comments0"

6,"James YeoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 19 Jul 2018If you are still young, i suggest taking calculated risks and testing out waters. Reading books can only carry you so far until you really dip into the water yourself. Test drive your hypothesis or strategies etc.Personally, i invested in small cap stocks and has been through ups and downs. The upside is much more so i am happy to stick with it. Rmb to find your own way. Cheers.0 comments0"
7,"Marcus GohLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 06 Jul 2018Definitely would recommend you to start investing in the stock market to learn about the different financial instructments and get your skin in the game. Make lots of mistakes and part of the 1k to learn from them. â€‹You could use 1k for several purposes1) Invest in yourself 2) Buy books (Financial, Investment)3) Start a side hustle that will produce income for you4) Dollar Cost Averaging (STI ETF)5) Robo-Advisories.0 comments0"
8,"Daniel LeeLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 06 Jul 2018my 2-cents on your current situation would be to suggest that you stay away from the market. Reason being:Due to your low capital, you...â€‹1) will need a high return in order to break-even from investments due to brokerage fees (min $10-28 per transaction which translates to 2-5% of your total investments assuming a buy and sell transaction is to be made)â€‹2) unable to sustain a proper investment strategy - diversification or dollar cost averaging. (at the very best you will be able to commit to a year of investment operation assuming $100/month)â€‹Remember this - It is not what you invest that will determine your return, it is how you invest that will determine your return. Because of your capital restrictions, i would not suggest you venture into the option of investments. You should be looking at ways to increase your capital and find instruments that will provide for your short-term saving needs. â€‹wait till you're able to commit approximately $300/month for dollar-cost-averaging strategy or at the very least $3-4k per stock investment. Otherwise, chances are you will find yourself in undesirable situation which will most probably cause you to incur a loss which goes against the first rule of investment: never lose money! â€‹Cheers. 0 comments1"
9,Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 06 Jul 2018There are a few roboadvisors and regular savings plan that cater for low capital.â€‹Most roboadvisors allow minimum contribution of $100. â€‹I would suggest you stay away from p2p lending with low capital because p2p is high risk0 comments0
