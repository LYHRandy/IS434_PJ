1,"NNNicholas NbxLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 23 Aug 2019So far I saw YouTrip is specifically excluded from Citibank and UOB card. But it worked for Standard Chartered Unlimited Cashback. I've tried and gotten 1.5% cashback on all my YouTrip top-ups with that card, at least at the of time of this post. Hope it helps!0 comments0"
