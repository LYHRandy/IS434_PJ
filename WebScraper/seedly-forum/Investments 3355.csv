WonderkidAnswered on 18 Jun 2018I believe before you started investing into other financial instruments, you should first invest in your financial education. ​You can:1) Start reading financial or investment books2) Attend courses or seminar. (SGX provides some quality free course in SGX Academy)https://www.sgxacademy.com/ 3) You can consider which type of Asset Class suit you personally after getting some knowledge and able to make prudent investments.0 comments4"

Having all your eggs in one basket is never a good idea (in this case, Singapore).​Thus robo advisories, and traditional FAs can help you set up such a portfolio and do a RSP into it as well.​A good rule of thumb is to have a fixed income portfolio that follows your age band, to have some capital preservation elements as well.​So once you hit your 30s, maybe you can have about 30% in bonds and property. 65% in equity and about 5% in cash instruments. 0 comments3"
