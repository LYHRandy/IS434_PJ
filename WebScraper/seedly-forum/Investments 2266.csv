MasterAnswered on 12 Mar 2019For a start, I thnk you might want to look at company with strong fundamentals (profitable, has sufficient liquidity to meet current obligations, has healthy cash flows etc).To maximise your returns, you could also look at diversifying your exposure eg: buying stocks from different industries that have low correlation with one another. For example, buying Boeing shares and perhaps JP Morgan shares - despite how the shares of Boeing tanked due to the crash 2 days ago, JP Morgan shares are unaffected.0 comments1"
