question,"Career Credit Card Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked on 24 Dec 2018I am a guy starting work next year and realize I have limited office wear. Any recommendations in this festive period?I know most guys commonly would get their office outfit at G2000 but it become such common and identical for us to see people wearing the same thing as us.Would need recommendation on male office wear.Priority for me is the comfort and the quality of design.As the office that I am working in does not require tie, so an informal long sleeve smart casual is fine.I believe there should be good deals in this festive season?Otherwise, I dun mind paying more for sth good and comfortable3 answersAnswerBump0"
