1,"Jason Yip, Project Manager, Sustainable Cities at ÉLectricité De FranceLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 23 May 2019All condos have en-bloc potential if you have enough holding power.The question should be how long and how much more can you earn?1) How LongThe timing depends on two factors (1) resident demographic and (2) market trends.The residents in the condo ultimately determines if a property goes for En-bloc, so you have to see what the residents are like. I know of a very good property that developers are desperately waiting for an en-bloc, but the very good location is also the reason why the residents refuse to en-bloc. Plus the residents are middle-upper with enough holding power to not want to en-bloc.I know many people who have lost so much money buying these kind of property only to be stuck for years with no en-bloc in sight.Market trend is the 2nd factor on how long. Similar to my previous point, location is a double edged sword. Developments around the condo might increase chances for en-bloc but it will also lead to residents resisting the en-bloc. This is made even worse whenever government announce certain plans in the area as it makes residents demand higher prices that developers refuse to give.2) How muchTHIS is the key question you need to ask. Because if a property has a high en-bloc return potential than it is worth waiting it out.Higher en-bloc return comes from:Freehold vs leaseholdcondo footprint vs land areanumber of residents per land areaIf original plot ratio had been increased0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 22 May 2019Low Flats / Few UnitsWhen developers redevelop properties / acquire and rebuild its of great opportunity to increase the number of units / build higher blocks. Therefore, with PLAB shifting and the height restrictions being lifted from the North-East / East area, I foresee enblocks happening there.LocationWith the above reasoning coupled with good location i.e. near upcoming malls / MRT stations, it'd be a motivation factor for transactions to happenPast enblocsMandarin Garden's developer has twiced tried to enbloc the condo but unfortunately the tenants did not agree to it. https://www.straitstimes.com/business/collective-sale-mandarin-gardens-fails-to-get-green-lightThere are reasons cited in the article too!
