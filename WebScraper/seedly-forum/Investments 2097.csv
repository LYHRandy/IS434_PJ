Grand MasterUpdated on 05 Jun 2019I am in the same situation as you.And I choose 1) Invest in your own businessA bit of both is ideal, so I started in a bit of both, but now most of money is back into my business.I have been doing business, have some successes and wondering whether to keep the income in stocks, or try to duplicate the success in other stocks.Realised that I can probably increase my money more if it is in my own business than from buying stocks, I decided to expand and bought over other online business to run and manage.What would you choose?a) Stocks give you returns of 7-10% per year?b) goods can sell for profit of 30%, if you can recycle your capital at least once a motnh, thats gross return of 30% per MONTH (net return probably would be smaller since you need to account for labour, rental etc)Its a lot tougher than buying stocks and not do anything (stocks dividends are the only true form of passive income), but the returns are higher in your own businesses and skills.If you are confident, go into your own business and skills.INVEST IN YOURSELF.0 comments1"

God of WisdomAnswered on 22 Mar 2019Too vague of a question dude.How confident am I in my business? What are my projections like, how are my competitors doing, etc.I'll still make sure I move faster money to fast money to slow money eventually.(Business - Stocks - Property/Bonds/Annuities)But if business is doing well now, and there's lots of market share up fro grabs, I'll invest in my business.0 comments0"
