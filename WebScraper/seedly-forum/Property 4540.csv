WizardAnswered on 17 May 2018Think of mortgage brokers as Independent financial advisors for insurance.​Mortgage brokers will guide and inform you about the whole loan process, range of loans available, reports and analysis.They would help you to compare the different loan packages which you require and based on your needs. Much more efficient than doing all the research by yourself, since there are ALOT of loan packages around. Every package has their own pros and cons, eligibility criteria, and you have your own financial needs too,​Find out more here: https://www.icompareloan.com/resources/mortgage-broker-singapore-best-rate/​​0 comments0"
