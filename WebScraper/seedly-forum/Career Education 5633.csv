question,"Career Education Asked by AnonymousAsked on 19 Sep 2019Hello all, can anybody advise me on what are the normal conditions for a company sponsoring employees for a course?E.g. have to bond for how many years according to how much the course cost?  If the course cost below 5K and the company requires you to have a bond for two years, is that reasonable? What are some aspects to consider before deciding to take up sponsorship? Thanks!1 answerAnswerBump0"

I had a previous employer who would have employees bond for 1 year should a course be 1k and above. Another employer who would have the budget for employees to go on the course so no bonding is required. Some aspects to consider is if you enjoy your job and have any plans on leaving? If you don't enjoy your job, don't let this sponsorship tie you down to the company or it would be stressful in future. Also, would this course benefit you in your current and future progression? Why are you taking the course in the first place? Not sure about any legal aspects, however.1 comment1"
