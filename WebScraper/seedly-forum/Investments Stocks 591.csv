question,Investments Stocks Asked by AnonymousAsked on 01 Sep 2019Hi everyone! Is it possible for me to sell some SGX stocks (bought using DBS Vickers cash upfront account) through my Standard Chartered trading account?Thinking if it's possible to do so since the fees for Standard Chartered are lower. Thank you!1 answerAnswerBump0
