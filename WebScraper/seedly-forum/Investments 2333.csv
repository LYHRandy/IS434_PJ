FreshieAnswered on 10 Mar 2019Hey there!I've actually had the same question as you a few months ago - I was looking for a small starting amount (as opposed to Saxo) and a comprehensive framework to invest. So I decided with two friends (in banking and fintech) to start Mattrvest.We are almost launched so please feel free to subscribe on our website or reach out to me for further information!www.mattrvest.com0 comments0

MasterAnswered on 10 Mar 2019Hey there!If you are looking to trade US stocks, want low charges at the same time receive news articles and research materials , I would recommend Saxo Capital Markets. It is a custodian account (as opposed to CDP) which means that it by default has low brokerage fees. Fees start from $3.99 USD per trade and holding fee is 0.12% of total asset under management (if i recall correctly), which when compared to other brokerage firms, is alot cheaper.0 comments0"
