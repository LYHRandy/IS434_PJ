1,"Jansen Ng, Business Student at NtuLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 10 May 2019Theres no fixed period of holding a stock. So then, it boils down to a question of when to sell:1) When you achieve the returns that you set out to achieve. 
If you enter with an intention of earning a certain %, or have an intrinsic value that you calculated, you should sell once it hits that value2) When the company is no longer good.
This could be due to a change in management, or a change in company direction, or a diminishing moat, or losing its competitiveness, or any other reasons that makes this company no longer desireable to keep3) When you realised you made a mistake.
Its possible to invest in a company you initially believed in, but realised that you made a mistake. eg didnt see the debt ratio which you later discover its too high to be sustainable. In this case, you may want to sell to cut loss4) When the stocks goes below your stop loss limit.
Some investors practice the habit of setting a stop loss limit, which may be 10% below the entry price or something. This is to cut the losses.Dont use money that u need for short term / short term goals, because you dont want to be forced to exit during a downturn.0 comments1"
