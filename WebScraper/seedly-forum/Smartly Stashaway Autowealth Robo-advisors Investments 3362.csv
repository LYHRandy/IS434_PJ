WizardAnswered on 19 Sep 2018Read Seedly comparison and user review of the online brokerage at : https://blog.seedly.sg/the-ultimate-cheatsheet-cheapest-stock-brokerage-in-singapore/​Those who you get via Smartly / Stashaway / Autowealth were all Robo and they inveset in ETF, bonds, gold , cash, a mixture of stuff. You can't buy direct as they are Robo means they will manage for you. You can only adjust the risk level of your profile.​To buy indexes / ETF, you still have to go via online brokerage such as DBS vickers. 0 comments0"
