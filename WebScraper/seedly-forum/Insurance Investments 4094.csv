1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Sep 2018Personally, would rather pick out individual REITS and avoid a fund structure? Why should I continue paying fees and not receiving the full dividends when I can just pay one time transactional fee when I purchase the REIT and obtain the full dividend? Possible to model a portfolio after the fund and do away with the annual fees..0 comments0"
2,"Nicholas ChanLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 27 Sep 2018Yes you can for diversification, but do take note of the addition fees & what the fund holds0 comments0"
3,"Morgan TanLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 27 Sep 2018I would like to see a lower cost (not more than 0.40% TER), market cap weighted S-REITs ETF. Is Lion-Phillip's Morningstar index methodology worth it for the additional cost?0 comments0"
4,"James YeoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 27 Jun 2018Personally, i feel elderly looking for passive income should opt for this. Being able to secure a 5% yield without the need to do any due diligence for individual reits is a blessing. Can just live off the dividends if portfolio size is big enough!On the other hand, it's good to handpick your own REITs if you have spare time and want to keep a closer watch for any change in events etc.0 comments0"

6,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 18 Jun 2018Actually answered this in another question also, but will share it here again as it addresses the same thing! When you are asking this question, I am assuming that you are thinking between a REIT ETF and a specfic REIT right. ​I personally prefer to buy Individual REITS! Because I can actually pick and choose and do an analysis of the REITs I have shortlisted :) Based on both a Qualitative and Quantitative scoring. (eg market, management, gearing ratios, occupancy rate, past dividend histories etc) I personally buy into the Retail and Healthcare REITs space because I have studied these two markets and back-tested them as well.​Some basic definitions:A real estate investment trust (REIT) is a company that owns, and in most cases operates, income-producing real estate.A REIT ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a collection of REITS which form up an index and is traded on the stock exchange.However, that being said, for beginners, espcially with the new ruling that they will not charge the 17% income tax on the fund itself, suddnenly the REIT ETFs become very viable for beginners who may not want to pick and choose but also participate in the higher dividend yielding asset class of REITs itself. ​That leaves the three main things to take note:​1) Fees - The Lion-Phillip S-REIT ETF has a management fee of 0.5%, the NikkoAM-Straits Trading Asia Ex Japan REIT ETF has a management fee of 0.5% and the Phillip SGX APAC Dividend Leaders REIT ETF has a management fee of 0.5%.​2) Management - Who are the fund managers behind the REIT ETF itself. Are they reputable folks?​3) Diversification - What REITs comprises of the ETF itself.​As a whole, it is ultimately your choice but the Lion-Phillip S-REIT has reasonable fees, and a known management team, so I guess it is fitting for beginner investors indeed!0 comments0"
