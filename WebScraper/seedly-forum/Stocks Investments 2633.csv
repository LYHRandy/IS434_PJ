1,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Feb 2019Aggresive stocks are like growth stocks that aims to grow very fast like technology and consumer discretionary, people will buy them when everything is going well but will cut them out first most of the time during recession because they are usually more of a want instead of a need. Defensive stocks are like utilities and consumer staples that even in recession people still have to use electricity, water and get basic items.  Invest through a local broker like DBS, Standard chartered and so on. But remember to do your research first before buying.0 comments0"
