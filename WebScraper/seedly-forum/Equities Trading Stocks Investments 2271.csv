1,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Mar 2019Hi there!Trading shares would suggest that you will be actively entering and exiting your positions in these shares. Knowing when is the right time and how to best execute these trading stategies require some degree of understanding of how the financial markets work and technical indicators.I'd say that if you are completely new to stocks and have no prior finance knowledge/background, it would be advisable that you start by looking at the fundamentals (eg: ratios, company prospects, industry and macroeconomic factors) and buying stocks to hold instead of starting out with trading.Of course, there are always people who loves the thrill of trading and jump straight into it - The choice is ultimately yours!0 comments0"

WizardAnswered on 12 Mar 2019Every beginner starts from somewhere, unless you want to restrict yourself to singapore savings bonds, fixed deposits and endowments.It is normal that you will make mistakes along the way and lose some money. It the ""tuition fees"" for being in the market whether is trading or investing. Start with small amounts as a beginner and as you build confidence you can increase the amount.0 comments0"
