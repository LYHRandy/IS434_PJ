1,"Alvin ChowLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 11 Jul 2018It depends on your strategy.​A deep value strategy like net net where you pay a fraction for the assets, management is not important.​If you buy a founder-led company or an A-grade stock, the business viability and prospect is important, and hence management will play a bigger role. The trap is that investors do not have the ability to discern this properly but they think they know a lot.0 comments0"
