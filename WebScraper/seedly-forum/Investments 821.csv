WonderkidUpdated on 19 Jul 2019Certain dividend stocks allow you to reinvest the dividends into shares (I remember I had ESR REIT asking me to opt-in for that or remain status quo i.e. dividends in cash). For a complete list you would have to dig in and do some research, or perhaps email blast the investment relations department for all the Singapore dividend stocks on SGX. I don't see any such list online for Singapore stocks.Alternatively, you can invest in overseas markets, in my mind it would be easier to get existing lists for DRIP investing.1 comment1"
