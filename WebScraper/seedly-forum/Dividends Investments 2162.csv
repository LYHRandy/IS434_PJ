1,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Mar 2019Preferred shares means that you will have priority compared to regular shares for dividends or if the company fold and liquidate. But you have no voting rights on the company. Regular shares are usually better for long term capital gains. The company will pay dividends to preferred first then regular. So if they are not doing too well and cant pay a lot dividends, regular shares might not get dividends.0 comments0"
