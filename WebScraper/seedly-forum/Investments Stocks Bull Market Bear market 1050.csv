question,"Investments Stocks Bull Market Bear market Asked by AnonymousAsked on 30 May 2019Given today's uncertain and volatile climate, is it a good time for new investors to enter the market?I'm planning to make some investments soon but am having some doubts. The market doesn't look very favourable and many have theorised that an upcoming market crash is looming in. I am concerned from an investor's point of view. Should i withhold my investment plans or dive in and begin investing to get a piece of the pie? Any advice would be helpful! Thanks.1 answerAnswerBump0"

Don't time the market.Instead of going in with a lumpsum, try stretching your capital injection over 6 months or so.0 comments0"
