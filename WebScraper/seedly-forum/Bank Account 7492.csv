1,"Jerry TanLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 03 Jan 2019I was having the same problem of not receiving notifications from my DBS mobile banking app. What I did was to turn off notifications and turn it back on again. When I tried syncing again, it worked! IDK how but it happened haha. To turn on/off notifications for the DBS app: For iOS devices
Access Settings → Select Notifcations → Select the DBS/POSB digibank app or DBS iWealth app → Turn on Notifications
For Android devices
Access Settings → Select Apps & notifications → Select Notifications → Select App notifications → Select the DBS/POSB digibank app or DBS iWealth app → Turn on Notifications 0 comments1"
