2,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Apr 2019To me, you need 3 cards and 1 more if you can.1) DBS Altitude Visa Card2) DBS Altitude AMEX Card3) Citi Premiermiles Visa Card4) Citi Premiermiles AMEX Card (high income req, so a bit of a bummer)The strategy is just charge everything to these cards. If that month Citi has a promotion, just charge to Citi's cards. If DBS has a promotion, just charge to DBS's cards.As points from these cards don't expire, just keep charging to these cards and you should have a sizeable amount of miles in a few years time. Boost the number of points by paying annual fees too.This way, you can don't need to worry about what cards give you what mpd la and no need to every year monitor the soon to expire points. You do need to make an effort to know how many miles for the dream redemption you want though.0 comments1"
