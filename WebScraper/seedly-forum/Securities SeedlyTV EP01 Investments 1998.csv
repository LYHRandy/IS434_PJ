1,"Leo WanLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 27 Mar 2019I believe that people at your age are probably still partying & Yolo-ing. To start investing this young, you have great potential! And Dollar Cost Averaging method is one of my favourite strategy, a no-brainer way into investing. I do practice a few different form of investment currently, and they are:Roboadvisory (Stashaway account for my case) and I set my risk profile to the highest, so more than 50% of my portfolio are on US equities and Reits. The rest are Asia equities and commodities.P2P lending. I have accounts in 3 different platforms, namely Funding Societies, Co-assets and Seedin.Tech. Based on my personal opinion, FS is the best for starters due to low barrier of entry and the frequency of new borrowers. On top of that, I like the repayment methods they have, especially borrowers that offer principle repayment + interest in a monthly basis, yielding you a higher effective interest rate.DBS RSP which only offer SG Index and Bonds. They are good to hold for long term, as it gives you dividend.Investment policy with AXA (Pulsar policy I think)Apart of personal investments, I think you need to cover your protection needs too yea? The just-in-case scenarios blah blah blah. I'm not into insurance, but getting a term plan & hospital/accident plan to cover your life should be enough for now I think?20 years later, you will thank yourself for taking the initiative to invest today. Keep it up!0 comments2"

If you are looking towards a safer form of investment, I think that you can look at investing the Singapore Savings Bond (SSB) since it is a government bond and thus likely to have lower risks. I think it is important to read up more about other forms of investments and better understand the various form of investments that are available then determine which type of investment you will be the most suited for. You can also look to invest in Roboadvisors, but of course do read up about what roboadvisors are as well as look at the various roboadvisors that are available in Singapore before deciding whether to invest in it.hope this helps!0 comments0"

From RSP, one can understand the importance of DCA - Dollar Cost Averaging, how $100 this month might get you 100 shares but $100 next month will get you 125 shares if the price of the plan falls by 20%. And to further make your RSP journey more fruitful, you could look into the basket of stocks the RSP includes and take a look at their individual performance, from there you can observe trends and identify which are the better performing ones, and soon enough, you might possible want to enter into a position in one of the counters.0 comments0"
