1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Jan 2019I believe bid offer spread is tighter for SPY, not to mention the trading volume is higher as well. For S27, minimum lot size is 10 shares, whereas you can opt to buy only 1 share of SPY. You can also trade options on SPY which can yield much better returns compared to buying and holding the ETF. 0 comments0"
