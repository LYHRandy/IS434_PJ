question,"Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 21 Jun 2019Hi, is anyone familiar with the sell limit for DBS Vickers Online trading account linked to MCA ?I am a 21 year old student and I just opened a DBS Vickers Online Trading account linked to MCA. The sell limit for my account is only $75 so I can't sell the stocks that I have bought using cash upfront. I read online that I have to email them to increase my limit but I do not have any income tax or salary statement since I'm still studying. Do I email them my CDP Portfolio instead?1 answerAnswerBump0"
