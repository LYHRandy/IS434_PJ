1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 12 Mar 2019To build on Sandra's point, by reducing the amount of taxes you pay, you actually increase the amount of cashflow you have. This is actually quite a counter-intuitive concept becasue depreciation reduces the amount of net income you have, yet it increases your cashflow. So actually, by taking on more depreciation, your net income is lower but the amount of cashflow your business generates is higher. This is because depreciation is a non-cash expense, but it reduces the amount of tax you have to pay, which increases cashflow.0 comments0"

In tandem with the depreciation tax shield is the accelerated depreciation method. This allows for faster depreciation during the early life of the asset and slows down as the asset ages. In other words, it provides higher tax savings during its early stages of the asset's life.0 comments0"
