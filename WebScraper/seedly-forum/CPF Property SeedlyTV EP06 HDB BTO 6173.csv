question,"CPF Property SeedlyTV EP06 HDB BTO Asked by AnonymousAsked on 31 May 2019If I finished paying for my house using CPF in 10 years, but only sell it 15 years later. What is the accrued interest I have to pay? I bought a BTO and do think i have the ability to finish paying off my HDB loan in 5 years using my CPF. But should i do it? I have already opted for a 10 year loan period maximum and would not be able to reverse it to 25 years. I am only concerned that the longer i stay in this house (>10 years and i would have finished paying for it using cpf), i would incur huge amount of accrued interest that I ""owe"" myself, instead of cpf generating it for me.2 answersAnswerBump0"

ProdigyAnswered on 03 Jun 2019See Gabriel's answer for checking your accrued interest.Refer to CPF website to see how to repay your OA and stop accrued interest from getting bigger. You would need to repay the accrued interest first then make partial or full payment of your principal.https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/servicing-your-hdb-loan/mortgage-loan/payment0 comments1
