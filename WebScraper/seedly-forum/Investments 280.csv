God of WisdomUpdated on 11 Jul 2019With a budget of $100/mth, it would not be cost effective to do stocks. You may consider building up your portfolio with some dividend paying unit trusts. You can do this on POEMS. Start with one fund first and you can switch out into other funds once your portfolio grows in size.6 comments6"

3,"Asheesh Chanda, Founder at Kristal.AILevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 10h agoI would suggest you evaluate a systematic plan into a balanced portfolio - which has a good mix of Equity ETFs, Bond ETFs and Gold. Systematically adding to such a portfolio every month can help build a corpus over time. You can also run the algorithm we have made available at Kristal.AI to see what is the suggested recommendation for your profile. Do note at Kristal.AI we have made investments upto 50K USD totally free of any advisory fee or hidden charges. Do compare it to other Robos before you go ahead. We also do not have any minimum requirement to start an account.0 comments5"

We compared the different RSP (DBS vs OCBC vs PhillipCapital). You can take a look here https://blog.seedly.sg/which-regular-savings-plan-is-the-cheapest/  Since you are talking about $100 monthly, I will recommend you going into POSB/DBS Invest saver. It has the lowest fees of 1%. Good thing about Invest saver is that you can invest without much monitoring. You can read more about POSB invest saver at their page here https://www.posb.com.sg/personal/investments/investing-in-funds/invest-saver . Feel free to ask if you have any more questions! :)0 comments2"
