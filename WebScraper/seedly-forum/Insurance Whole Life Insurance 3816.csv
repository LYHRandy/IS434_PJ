Go back to the insurer, get a updated Benefit Illustration, and see what is the current IRR (internal rate of return) for the life insurance, while also understand do you require the death benefit of the plan.If you do not require it, then you can do another calculation to see if it is still worth to hold on to the insurance.You may want to hire my services to see the report. https://www.qoo10.sg/item/AFFORDABLE-PROFESSIONAL-CONSULTANCY-SERVICES-FOR-INSURANCE-POLICY/646088766?banner_no=1305330Does the return of the insurance bring any meaning to you? Is it growing at a higher rate than 4% risk free (Hint: CPF SA)But if really, you wish to surrender, do contact me either on facebook, or look for your FA to get a better surrender value at the secondary market.
