question,"Career General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 27 Sep 2018Currently serving NS as an NSF. SAF offered me an overseas placement in Brunei for 12 months, offering additional $1,200 on my monthly salary. Should I take up the offer?Anyone been to Brunei for training before? How's the place there like? Will be stationed at both the HQ for admin tasks and Jungle School to assist cadets and trainees. Is it worth suffering for 1 year for $1,200 more?5 answersAnswerBump1"

1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Me! I've been there twice before. for 2 x 1 month stints. First time as a Infantry cadet, second time as an Infantry officer bringing my cadets there. ​What's not to love about Brunei? Haha I'm joking. Lakuin camp is simply amazing and pretty laid back in my opinion. Here is what I remember from my 5 years ago experience:​Good:The regulars there are like a family together, they take care of each other (from cadres to people)Theoretically it's not too far away from Singapore, but if you count in the speedboat ride from the camp to the main town and the bus ride to the airport, that will add another 2 hours of travelling.The food was amazeballs! The cook there really put in effort to cook the good food unlike Singapore camps and very local fare as well.There is like a small gym in the squash court and the people there play football every night also (in the basketball court)I actually spoke to the locals there as well regarding their posting there, most of them actually liked it because they get to save up (the additional $1,200 you shared) which is alot at a young age and building up your savingsTake the time there to read up about personal finance and investing and maybe even get started :)I worked alot with the local cadres and also the local medics, drivers etc, they are all really friendly people and I think this 1 year of their life is really a huge experience for them to bring home and share their stories next time when they ORD! Really you'll learn so much and make new friends there.The regulars stay in air con bunks and a seperate side of the camp which looks very nicely built... unlike the cadets and people who come in and out, it's really messy hahaYou get the kick back and leave the hustle and bustle of the Singapore life behindBad:There's simply no recreation in terms of towns and stuffThe nearest one is a boat ride away at the city center and there is only one big mall... called ""THE MALL"" It's like over 1.5 to 2 hours away from camp. (so travelling time to and fro is really long...There is a movie theather there tho, we watched JUDGE DREAD i distinctly remember. It was affordable and also the food was goodWifi back then was not good.. I dont know about now hahaAll the best man, for me, if I had the chance, I would grab it, even though being far away from my family would be really tough, but I think both the experience and the chance to save up/while investing could be worth the time there! ​Life only goes one way forward, these opportunities only come once in awhile!​P.S: I can actually link you up with a friend of mine who went over there to become a Cadre actually he signed on and went there for 2 years!1 comment2"

And do his vocation as a clerk while exploring Thailand. I think it'll be a good experience. Sad thing for me, an airforce driver, we can't get to go overseas... 0 comments0"
