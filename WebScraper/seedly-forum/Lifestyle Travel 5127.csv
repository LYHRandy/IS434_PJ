1,"Alvin LeongLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I travelled quite a fair bit in the U.S. in the past 3 years, and here's what I learnt through my research!Car RentalSilvercar: Best car rental experience ever. Owned by Audi, they only rent Audi A4, Q5 and most recently, A5 Cabriolet. Super reasonably priced compared to other big national agencies if you‚Äôre looking for a Large (i.e Camry/Altima/equivalent) or Luxury vehicle (seriously, why drive a Golf to the national parks of the west coast?!). No queues at the airport, they‚Äôll pick you up in an A4 to their nearby office to pick up the car, after signing the contract digitally on their app on your own smartphone, you unlock the car using your phone, and off you go. Superb customer service, I returned the car with a flat tyre and they even refunded me $25 for the inconvenience caused lol. The savings really come if you are aged between 22-25, since they don‚Äôt charge young drivers fee from 22 onwards. Most other car rental places charge up to $30/day for drivers 2 comments4"

3,"HC TangLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019All Kenneth shared is excellent! I have some personal experience shared below on top of others: ‚Äã1) GPS - Can rental company charges by day, so if you're android, download your own GPS and USA Map, saves a lot of $.2) Hotwire -  4 start hotel at 2 star rates.  Full size sedan @ small car rate. The only catch is that don't get to choose hotel (but can choose the star) and don't get to choose car mode (but get to choose cc / size ). Save a lot of $. 3) Left side driving - Recommend for more experience driver and it's the same as Asian right side, as you as you follow traffic flow, quite safe. Just becareful when there's no car, we tends to forget, just quickly drive to the road side and get back in line with the right directions.4) Traffic Police and Speed - SG is km/h and in states is miles/h, make sure we learn the speed and always drive in between cars, so don't be the head (fastest) and don't be the tail (slowest) as the LAPD or SFPD (TP) will appear out of nowhere and event book a ticket when drives exceed 5miles/h. 5) Lots of homeless people, so always travel in groups and avoid dangerous place alone or at night avoid going out alone. 6) Their left most (due ot left hand drive) is for car pool or more than 2 passenger or family lanes that is faster and less congestions, so if you have more than 2 pax, go ahead and use that lane, will save a lot of time and avoid lots of congestions. ‚ÄãStay safe folks! Drive and travel safely! :)4 comments4"

5,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Oh this is a fun question haha! And yea, I spent 2 weeks on the West Coast USA for holiday this time last year. It was a blast!‚ÄãHere are some SERIOUS hacks in no order:BIGGEST hack: Buy the National Parks Pass on Carousell! (you can get it at a much lower price than if you get it there, around USD80, you can get it for maybe SGD50 or less?) ANOTHER BIG hack: Download and use the app: HOTEL TONIGHT. I actually used it a ton. In Las Vegas, hotels are heavily discounted more than 40% off, but the only thing is you will have to risk booking it on the day itself :) but rest assured there are a ton of hotels in Vegas.Another no-brainer: Download and use the app: YELP. It is a true life-saver! You can actually use it to check out the top restaurants and reviews in the area! (seriosuly similar to Seedly here) hahaha, it's what most americans use and highly effective.Stay Airbnb in LA, seriously alot cheaper. The other smaller towns along the way, you can stay at common motels like Red Roof Inn or Best Western.Plan your route properly to avoid driving for more than 3 hours or more. Think of more rest stops. In US, Google maps timings are usually very ambitious.For driving, you should get the insurance for the car, highly recommended as we actually witness 2 accidents, but thankfully not us.We decided to drive all the way from SF to LA to Vegas and back. We should have flown from LA to Vegas and back from Vegas to SF. Reduce the driving time, it got quite dangerous also towards the night time. Ton of random dogs and cars driving quickly in the other direction.In your first week, stop by the supermarket to buy a huge 500ml bottle set, we bought 24 bottles and it lasted us 2 weeks!You can also drop me an email or comment below, I can send you our West Coast itenary if you would like! :)‚ÄãOr if you would wish, you can watch our roadtrip video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulNJ6CJmhvA9 comments3"

7,"John YongLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Parking: If possible, try to keep all your quarters for meter parking. You'll also have to read the parking signs to see when meter parking is in effect. They are all different timings depending on where you park. ‚ÄãIf you're parking in malls or barrier parking, you might be able to get parking validation, which will make parking fees way more affordable (less $10 USD or so). There are conditions to get validation (like eating at certain restaurants, spending up to $XXX etc.)‚ÄãCar Rental: I've only booked Hertz, and they have been reliable thus far. You obviously need a GPS, but if you have a smartphone with data, you don't need to rent one. Reserve your car online (sign up for Hertz Gold Plus rewards - it's free, and it shortens waiting time if you're picking up your car at the airport) and pick up your car at your desired outlet. ‚ÄãBe sure to inspect your car for damages and faults (I had to change cars once because it had a slight leak). You don't need any international or conversion license. Insurance is always a good idea.‚ÄãDriving: Stay away from peak hour traffic in the evenings. Traffic normally builds up around 4pm and last till around 7 - 8pm. A simple 15-mins drive can turn into 1.5 hours if the jam is really bad. ‚ÄãOthers: Don't take CDs from anyone there. They'll say it's free but they'll always expect a tip ($5-$10) for their shitty rap music. The same for fake mascots unless you really want a picture with them (Hollywood Boulevard and Venice Beach). ‚ÄãTry to dress like the locals there and they won't really bother you that much. ‚ÄãGet used to tipping. I usually tip 15 to 17% depending on the service. ‚ÄãThese tips only apply to Los Angeles and Las Vegas, cause I've only been to these places at the West Coast.2 comments2"
8,"Kenneth Lou26 Jun 2018Oh! Thanks for these great tips!! especially on the parking and the random ppl trying to sell you stuff! haha. And of course, who can forget about the tips. Really crazy amounts of tips. But i think most likely you'll get used to it very quickly.John Yong26 Jun 2018Yup. I make yearly trips to LA. Tipping almost becomes second nature once you're there."
