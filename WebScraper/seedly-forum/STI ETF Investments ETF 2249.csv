1,"Jonathan NgLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 13 Mar 2019Two most popular ETFs in Singapore are the SPDR STI ETF (SGX: ES3) and Nikko AM STI ETF (SGX: G3B). However, the SPDR STI ETF is better than its counterpart as it has a lower expense ratio (annual fee that ETFs charge unitholders) and lower annualised tracking error. It has also produced an annualised return of 7% to date.There are also other ETFs listed on SGX such as SPDR S&P 500 ETF which tracks stocks in USA (if you are looking in diversifying overseas) and the SPDR Gold Shares ETF.0 comments1"
