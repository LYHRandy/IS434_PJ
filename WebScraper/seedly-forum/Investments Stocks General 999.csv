In a myraid of ways in fact:Trade wars = Increase in Tarrifs when exporting goods. If you're running a company, would these tarriffs be absorbed by your company or would it be passed on to the consumers? If it's absorbed by your company = increase in costs.If it's passed on to consumers = decrease in units sold / revenueAside from supply and demand, one needs to consider from a macro perspective. During trade wars, currencies would be affected too. Countries would want to remain attractive to investors hence they will lower their currencies. This would affect businesses based on fx conversions too and will be factored into their financial statements. Once your top line is lower as compared to previous quarters / years, it'll lead to a weaker bottom line and hence a lower DPU or even leading to the company being in the red.Hope it helps! :)1 comment2"
