WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Actually I would want to correct myself :) I feel for anyone whose family or dependents heavily depend on their source of income would stand to benefit from Disability insurance.I quoted the examples of Doctors and Lawyers as extreme examples because they have the highest earning potential and thus their disability would result in severe income loss for their family before they get back working again.Hope this helps!
