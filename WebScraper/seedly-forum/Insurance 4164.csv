question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 15 Jul 2018Is it necessary to buy retirement plan from insurance company?Currently I can only save 300 for retirement fund (ya it is a pathetic amount at the moment). Basic insurances have been taken care of. I'm also saving for emergency fund and fund to buy flat in future. I'm also contributing to my retired parents' expenses. With the minimal savings towards retirement, is it necessary to buy retirement plan from insurance company or am I better off putting savings into CPF for the interest rate? Thank you.6 answersAnswerBump1"

1,"Christopher HowLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 17 Jul 2018There's no such thing as too little when it comes to savings. Every dollar counts!​Let's break it down on your needs:1) Saving for emergency fundYou need this money to be liquid (to be withdrawn easily without penalty in times of need). This money should be saved in a savings account. Don't bother about finding out which savings account pays the highest interest and chase after that little bit of interests because it's not worth your effort jumping through more hoops the guys in Cirque du Soleil for that.​2) Giving parents' allowanceNaturally this is a cash expense. But have a chat with your folks. If they don't really need your money right now, ask if you can put a portion of it into their CPF retirement account. It will accumulate interests for your folks and entitle you some tax relief (win-win).​3) Saving for HDB purchaseIf I have a time machine, this is what I'd do. Budget how much it costs to buy a flat and how long you will need to save to make the purchase. Save $XXX per month for it. The amount you need to save should ideally cover the downpayment, renovation, misc. fees and hopefully a little bit more (if possible).Don't top up your CPF and then use it to pay for the flat. That's a big mistake. The more CPF money you use to pay for the flat, the more accured interest you will need to pay back to CPF. If I have a time machine, I'd try to at least repay 50% of my mortgage loan in cash instead of 100% CPF.Doing the above will help you plan for your retirement better because you are letting your CPF money do what it is meant to do. Stay in your CPF account and compound interests.​4) Saving for retirementDo not buy a retirement plan from insurance companies. It will not be able to help you retire.Instead, plan to save that $300 and invest in index ETFs. You can either invest through brokerages or robo advisors.The reason for the above is also for liquidity. Assuming you're still young, your investment objectives and goals may change. You want to invest in channels that you can easily sell if those objectives and goals change. Don't lock your retirement funds in a prison (retirement plans).0 comments4"

However if you are undisciplined in savings- Meaning you may be tempted to use the requirements savings for splurging.  Insurance plans are good to lock you up. Otherwise i will recommend you putting 300 either in cpf, srs or just purely investing in etfs 0 comments3"

If not, you would be better off top up the money into CPF SA to 1) get tax relief; 2) earn 4% interest compounding till retirement age. After which, use the money to buy CPF life that give you monthly payout till you die. This is something similar to Annuity Plan.The retirement account also offer fantastic interest rate (in saving context) around 4-6%p.a. compounding. ​There are advantages and disadvantages of doing this way. The biggest problem is that the money top-up cannot be withdrawn till age 55/65 (depending if you set aside sufficient money for Retirement Sum). Hence, it is not liquidate. ​As for the money saved to buy flat, i suggest that you investing this money instead of just ""saving"" it. My personal experience is that it is hard to catch up with the property price increase than my rate of saving. Please do some reading about investing in ETF, P2P etc. Explore different options rather than just insurance solution.​However, investing is not for everyone. We don't have to force ourself if that's not your cup of tea. Cheers!0 comments2"
5,"Daniel LeeLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 16 Jul 2018When dealing with retirement planning, there's always two parts to your equation that you will need to address to provide for the income you need to achieve financial freedom. They are:​1) Guaranteed monthly payout: provides for the basic expenses you need to maintain your daily lifestyle (need)2) Non-Guaranteed monthly payout: provide for the additional expenses incurred for leisure activities (want)​Hence when planning for your financial freedom, it is essential that you quantify your respective needs and wants and from there include any products that will provide for the guaranteed / non-guranteed monthly payout. ​For instruments that provide for guaranteed monthly cashflow, they are: cash, annuity products (retirement plan),  CPF LIfeFor instruments that provide for non-guaranteed monthly cashflow, they are: investments (dividends / interest) and annuity products ​*** bear in mind that for retirement plans, different products / companies provide for different emphasis on the proportion between guaranteed and non-guaranteed monthly payout. Hence, you will have to find the right one that will fit your own plan.​If i may do a little bit of promotion, I'm an IFA that provides for full financial planning services, should you need help in terms of quantifying your retirement expectations and finding the right strategy to help achieve your desired state, you can find out more about my practices on my website: www.sgifa.net ​​​​​0 comments1"

WizardAnswered on 16 Jul 2018I would advise to max out CPF before considering any retirement plans for a few reasons​CPF is risk free and the interest rate is probably one of the highest out there. Plus a bonus 1% on the first 60kCPF gives you tax incentives if you do voluntary contribution​Once you reach retirement, there is CPF life which provides you income for life.0 comments1"
