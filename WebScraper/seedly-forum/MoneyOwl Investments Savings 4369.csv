1,"Eddy CheongLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered 2w agoHi Gurei DotThanks for your interest in investing with MoneyOwl. The projected portfolio values of $140k and $240k are the best and worst returns that can be achieved based on 75% of the time over your time horizon of 25 years. Regarding how these are computed, you could contact MoneyOwl at enquiries@moneyowl.com.sg for assistance.0 comments1"
