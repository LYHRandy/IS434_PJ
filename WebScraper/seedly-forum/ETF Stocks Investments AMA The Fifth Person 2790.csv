1,"Victor Chng, Co-Founder at Fifth Person Pte LtdLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 18 Feb 2019Hi,Below I invest, I will deteremine the number of stocks that will be in my portfolio. For instance, you want to start with a 20 stocks portfolio. Hence, each stock percentage will be 5% maximum. With starting $10k, you can;t invest in 20 stocks because the bokerage fee will kill you. Hence, you may want to invest in 3 stocks at the start which each stock to be around 33%. As you work and save more money, you will have new capital to deploy. Hence, with the new capital, you should deploy in other companies so that your percentage allocation of the inital 3 stocks will reduce until 5% max. The reason I am doing this is becuase investing is a game of probability. If you invest in 20 stocks equally, with 10 stocks making money and 10 stocks losing money. Overall as a portfolio, you will still make money.0 comments0"
