3,"Siti PutriLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 21 Aug 2018I will stay away from MLM, land banking, paper gold buyback scheme, IPO and luxury item (bags, watches, arts) reselling.
For IPO, I don't buy as I prefer at least 4+ years track record. Also most IPO prices rather volatile for the first year. 
For luxury items, the the stuff must really be in pristine condition to be able to fetch good price or even breakeven price, plus it is subjective to 'trend', supply/demand or 'perceived value'. Also i will avoid ILP insurance, although granted this is subjected to the choice of funds and long term objective. Just not for me as the fees adds up 0 comments2"
4,"Leong Wen Fong, Economics and Management at University of LondonLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Aug 2018I wouldn't say never, but I at the moment, I would not go into cryptocurrency.Reason being I find that I can't really measure trends, and I don't have a lot of information on it.​I'm sure given time, it could become a commonplace currency, and also be more stable in its value. For the moment though, the risk is far too high in my opinion.​The principle for me is never to invest in something you don't understand well enough, how it works, what can cause it to go up and what can cause it to fall, and of course how much it can rise and fall is a factor as well. So just some things to consider before you make any kind of financial commitment as well!0 comments2"

RookieAnswered on 21 Aug 2018i would never invest in anything that i don't have enough knowledge of.i believe that getting the best deal in town is all about doing enough research, understanding the investment, where the returns come from and the credibility of the sources before taking the plunge.putting the trust on someone is as good as having someone to blame when something goes wrongat this moment, cryptocurrency seems to be too much of a hype and the prices are no longer reflective of its underlying value0 comments1"
