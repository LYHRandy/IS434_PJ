1,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 03 May 2018They are covered under SDIC for their Singapore operations. This offers some protection to consumers insured under them.​As for products, they offer some RMB and SGD products. The RMB products might have higher yields but the consumer will bear the exchange rate risk since your base currency is SGD.​According to wikipedia, it is one of China's biggest insurer and they are a listed company too.0 comments0"
