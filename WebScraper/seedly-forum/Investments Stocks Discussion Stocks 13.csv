2,"HMHeah Min AnLevel 1. FreshieAnswered 6d agoMy 2 cents:What's your goal when you bought this stock? Capital appreciation or yields? Choose 1 objective only because it determines your exit pointIf it's capital appreciation, did it reach your desired level?If it's yields, does it stay at your desired level?Things get complicated because the investor wants the best of both worlds.0 comments0"
3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered 6d agoThe question you need to ask yourself - can you buy into another stock at a fair or cheap valuation and yet has a similar or higher dividend yield together with similar growth potential? Or can you channel the proceeds into a higher-yielding instrument? If not I'd suggest holding on to your current position until something else can be found. Of course, if you feel that the stock is at current highs and unlikely to go further, can liquidate and hold cash first while waiting for a new opportunity.Hope this helps.0 comments0"
