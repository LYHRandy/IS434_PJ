question,"Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 31 Oct 2018How do we get the historical value (e.g. past 5 years NAV) of a REIT?When valuing a REIT, there are some ratios that we need to look at.. e.g. the NAV, gearing ratio, gross revenue etc. How do you guys extract those values (past 5 years NAV value)? Do you guys manually browse through all the past financial results and extract them individually, then plug into excel and plot the charts? Just wondering if there could be an overview section/place where we can view the data for past years at a glance etc.Reference: http://www.crct.com.sg/irfinancialresult.html2 answersAnswerBump0"
