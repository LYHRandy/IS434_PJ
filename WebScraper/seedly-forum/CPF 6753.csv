I'm assuming here that you may be donating other assets to charity too, or have specific people you would like to have those assets; which means you'll need to make a will so that all assets will be distributed according to your wishes.0 comments1"

Most charity organisation knows the paperwork for this.For Medisave, you can use to a certain limit per situation. you always hear in social media of unfortunate cases where people have Medisave but is restricted by the maximum. Case by case, and you need social workers and proper appeal channels with doctor support.PS: btw no intention of getting married doesn't mean you can't have a relationship with loved ones and having a great partnered life ;)0 comments1"
