God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Make sure you have 6 months of your salary as an emergency fund first before investing.And unless you're extremely risk adverse, you should be investing more in equities and not so much in fixed income yet. Take more risk, you're young. 2 comments3"
2,"Question Poster03 Nov 2018Hello thank you! For equities, do you mean Etfs? I do invest 400 a month into sg etfs. Considering roboadvisor too. Hariz Arthur Maloy03 Nov 2018An ETF is just a closed ended fund. There are equity ETFs, bond ETFs, Property ETFs, Gold ETFs. Equity would means stocks and shares. I would personally not invest in a STI ETF as it is very high risk with low probability in return. And also a Robo Advisor is just a tool that helps you invest in a globally diversified portfolio. And they have different portfolios of differing risk levels and % in asset allocations. Your portfolio should be about a 75/25 split into equity and fixed income for your age right now. This can probably give you 7-8% in returns. If you want to invest in SSBs, then you can go for a higher % of equities in your robo portfolio. "

Also, may I ask if the current 10k savings you have are needed in the near future? If not, then there should not be any problems with investing this money.0 comments0"
