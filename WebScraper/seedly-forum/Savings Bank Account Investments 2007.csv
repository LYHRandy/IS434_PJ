question,"Savings Bank Account Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 06 Oct 2018If I am looking to invest in ETFs each month, is the best way to invest through a bank (POSB Invest-Saver/ OCBC/ etc)? Or are there better ways you would recommend?Read that the general recommendation points towards using banks (POSB Invest-Saver for below $500, or OCBC for above $500). Are there any other ways of investing in ETFs based on your experiences, that will minimise the transaction fee charged?On that note, for investing in ETFs, typically what is considered reasonable as management / transaction fee?6 answersAnswerBump1"

1,"Adriel ChiaLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 27 Mar 2019Phillip Securities has a Share Builder Plan which is in essence a RSP. I invest $1k a month on the same counters (STI ETF and ABF Bond ETF) offered by POSB Invest Saver. The transaction cost ended up to be just about $6 + a few cents. This option has a total of 37 other counters for you to choose. But do note that the $6 charges only applies if your monthly transaction is less than or equal to $1k per mth and less than or equal to 02 counters per mth.If you going for more counters or investing more than $1k per mth, then you will need to invest at least $5k per mth to make the 0.2% or $10 (whichever is higher) worth it.0 comments2"

But easier cos it is automated and you dont realy have to think of it... via DCA (dollar cost averaging)​for self investing via your broker, you’ll have to accumulate more for it to make sense and invest at a higher amount so that the $10 to $20 brokerage fee becomes less than 1%. And often you’ll be abit worried on when to buy up the ETF... or you may forget etc.​your call!0 comments1"

4,"Caleb KhooLevel 1. FreshieUpdated on 07 Oct 2018Yup, save more and DIY quarterly. I know DBS has cash upfront broker account for SG stocks, not sure about STI ETF though. It is cheaper to use prepaid account.​However, the advantage of using posb or ocbc is they deduct automatically. Good for busy people. 0 comments0"
5,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Oct 2018Posb's Invest-saver or Maybank KE's Monthly Investment Plan (gives you access to both STI ETFs and a whole list of other local stocks) would work. Transaction fees are straight forward at 1% which are reasonably cheap. Management fees / expense ratio would be another thing altogether. Not exactly high at around 0.3% I'd say, but not exactly low when compared to Vanguard's at 0.0X% ish for their VOO and VTI counters. But still WAY better than buying into equity mutual funds / unit trusts at their 1.5% and above management fees. 0 comments0"
6,Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 06 Oct 2018Yes the best and easiest ways to invest in ETFs are through a bank's regular savings plan such as POSB InvestSaver or through robo advisors such as StashAway or Smartly. I would consider a reasonable management/transaction fee as 1% & below0 comments0
