1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi there! One reit with a good track record in revenue growth and distributable income First Real Estate Investment Trust (SGX:AW9U). First REIT is a healthcare REIT with properties located in Indonesia, Singapore and South Korea. Over the past 10 years, Firts REIT has achieved a CAGR of 18.03% in portfolio valuation. It expanded from 4 properties worth S$257.1 million in 2007 to 20 properties worth S$1.35 billion in 2017. Additionally, the group revenue increased from S$28.1 million in 2007 to S$111.0 million in 2017 (CAGR of 13.8%). In terms of distribution per unit (DPU), First REIT grew 1.2% to 8.57 cents. Moving forward, First REIT seems to be able to sustain growth with its favorable lease agreements and strong pipeline of properties for potential acquisitions in the future. Additionally, as of 31 Dec 2018, the REIT's gearing ratio stood at 35% which is considerably lower than the regulatory gearing ceiling of 45%. This puts First REITs in a good position to fund future acquisitions through debt.2 comments2"
