1,"Clarence Chua, Financial Planning Specialist at Prudential Assurance SingaporeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterAnswered on 24 Apr 2019The basic insurance to get for your child after he is born will be health insurance. (Hospitalisation and Accident when he is abit older)
These will take care of medical bills for you.Also you may want to consider getting critical illness plan for you child as in the event of a critical illness, one parent might stop working (this will result in a loss of income) to take care of the child. 
Or the family might hire an assistant to take care of the child and the payout from your plan can be use to facilitate all these. Do also plan for your child education the moment he/she is born, education costs is rising like crazy!I pray that your family will have a smooth delivery for the little angel!

It definitely burnt a hole in my pocket but i think it was a very good reminder on the importance of 1. https://heartlandboy.com/integrated-shield-plan-for-your-child/0 comments0"
