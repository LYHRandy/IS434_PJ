Paying other banks credit card bill, or paying for the same bank credit cards is excluded from getting rewards/points/cashback and they do not count towards pushing your Multiplier to a higher tier of interest.0 comments0"

5,"Shun OhLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 30 Aug 2018It really depends on your spending habits because the cards with better cashback rates usually have other requirements to fulfill. For the second part, technically you can't pay off one credit from other bank with another credit card...If not there will be a loophole in the system hah.0 comments0"
6,Alan SeowLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 11 Jun 2018After doing some research. I decided with UOB one account as it doesn't even require you to bank in your salary. 3 GIRO accounts. But the extra effort doesn't warrant this. At max at 50k what u can get is 100 a month max including the blended deposits. Yes it's blended. Meaning the higher deposit rates are for 40k and above. 0 comments0
7,"John Ong ZhenxiLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 10 Jun 2018I haven't used DBS Multiplier, from what I understand, it doesn't require one to spend huge amounts on the credit card. As long as the Salary credited monthly is > 2,000. And maybe use your DBS cc for 1 purchase. That will get you near to max returns. It makes sense to me actually to charge to other credit cards to optimise returns.0 comments0"
