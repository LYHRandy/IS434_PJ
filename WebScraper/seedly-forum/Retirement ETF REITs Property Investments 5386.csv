God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019REITS are a great way to get passive income but shouldn't bank so much on it. Make sure you still diversify. They are very volatile and sensitive to interest rates. I'd go for individual REITS though. There's only so few and not that hard to analyse a good REIT. 1 comment4"

WizardAnswered on 30 Oct 2018The easy one would be to buy the REIT ETF since they also removed the additional tax on the REIT ETF which makes it almost as competitive as buying up individual REITs.However, for me personally, I chose to pick out my own REITs as I find more meaning in buying up REITs which I frequent often. And only some REITs which I understand more than others eg Retail and Healthcare. For logistics and commercial, I catch no ball. So I chose to not buy from those sectors.0 comments1"
4,"DeleteEditArpita MukherjeeLevel 2. RookieAnswered 6d agoHi,Although both strategies have their own advantages and benefits, I'd still recommend, you go with individual REITs for starters. Here's why:High Yield â€“ This is a big one! As REITs are required to pay out most of their taxable income to shareholders they offer a high stable dividend yield. Dividend yields vary depending on the type of REIT and geography but typically they yield anywhere between 4% to 8% (paid out quarterly or semi-annually).Hassle-Free â€“ REITs provide an easy means for the average investor to access a sometimes unaffordable property market (e.g. commercial real estate), either via an exchange or over the counter like a mutual fund. In comparison, buying and selling the property directly involves higher expenses and more headache with administrative tasks. When investing in REIT there are professional managers who deal with all of these.Diversification â€“ REIT returns have shown a relatively low correlation to equity stocks and fixed-income investments, which makes it a good portfolio diversifier. When most stocks are overvalued, this is the time you want more of your portfolio to be in bonds and REITs instead of stocks. REIT share prices are also less volatile than equity stocks. This is because rental income and expenses are predictable over the short and long term.Total Return â€“ In addition to income, REIT returns also capture the price appreciation of the underlying REIT properties. Hence it is a good hybrid between dividend income and growth in the stock price. With property generally having a high return potential, REITs over a period of time have shown strong returns and have outperformed the stock index. In 2019 alone REITs have rallied by ~15%, outperforming the S&P 500 index.Tax Advantage â€“ REITs are not taxed on the corporate level as long as they pass most of their earnings directly to shareholders. However, investors do need to pay taxes on dividend income and capital gains from sales of the REITs.Affordability: Investing in a large asset such as a shopping mall or office/institution might not always be an affordable bid. Also, investors will always be wary of the risks involved in investing all their money in one asset. But by investing in a REIT, they get to put their money in a pool of similar such assets but in smaller amounts. This will also dilute the risk of losing all the money lest the market observes a fall.Hope this helps!I work at Kristal.AI, and my mojo is to help people make the right financial decisions.

5,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 Jun 2019I'll choose to buy individual reits. Does not make sense to pay management fees and receive a lower yield as compared to buying individual reit counters. The holdings in the Etf are transparent so you can replicate if you wish to0 comments0"
6,"Emile ChiuLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 03 Jun 2019Disclaimer: I am no reit expert, just sharing my views on this.Tldr: if the 2 industrial and retail reit have steady grown and proven growth rate then you can stick to it. If you want to have a more diversified portfolio consider the reit etf (Lion-Philp ETF) which is more stable (per se) as you are investing in more reits in different sector. Many eggs in many different basket ðŸ¥š Too short, want more (TSWM) ðŸ“– Here are some factors or key points to note for considering etf vs indi (individual reit) 1) like what Hariz mentioned, reits are very volatile and sensitive to interest rates so this is something you have to consider 2) Like what Kenneth Lou said, the removal of the additional tax on reit etf makes it almost as competitive vs individual reit. So this makes the reit etf considerable to buy3) the thing about indi (refer to above to know the abbreviation) is that good indi reits with a good factors (such as DPU, growing NPI and dividend yield) are heavy to invest in. (for a small retail investor) Heavy as in 1 share in ParkwayLife REIT is 2.99 (as of time of writing) and it will cost you $2990 to buy 1000 shares (of course you can buy 100 shares but the dividend is lower by 10 times). That's a whopping amount for a small retail investor. So this is why (maybe) retail investors consider reit etf which is priced at 1.082 (as of time of writing) which is significantly cheaper but provides stability and diversity.So first of all, what I would say is if you have a considerable stash of money ( 5k) and you want to buy the reits you understand you can purchase indi reits in the healthcare sector as they are more defensible or retail sector if you frequent to the malls you have been and like the atmosphere at the mall.If you want a buy and forget approach (but at least research and read reviews a bit before you buy) then you can consider an etf reit. Cause they are also almost stable in the sgx market.0 comments0"
