1,"Jacky YapLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019hello!​Yes i think it is ok. p2p lending is run by experienced team who will screen all the loans before they take them in and open the loans to public investors. im not in the p2p business but i think this is the process:​1) loan application by SME from P2P2) P2P platform screens, does audit of the SME's business and determines risk and suitability + loan quantum3) If business is sound, P2P approves the loan, if it is a bad business, P2P platform wont approve4) Once loan approved, P2P platform publishes the loan and avails it for investment by public investor5) public investor can take a look at the summary of the SME, the risk assessment and decides if he wants to invest in the SME's loan.​So you can choose which business loan you want to back. And you can choose the amount. ​It is also in P2P platform's interest to ensure that the default rate is very low so that investors will continue to invest, because a bad apple will really break investor's confidence in the P2P platform. Funding society's default rate is 1 comment1"

3,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 17 Jun 2018As always one must account for the risk involved. In this case of P2P, can you accept that you may lose all your capital?​When a default occurs, there is a chance you might not get back your capital at all. ​You can check out some reviews here:https://seedly.sg/reviews/p2p-lending0 comments1"

P2P lending carries very high risks, so if you do not have experience, it is likely that you may end up making large mistakes when it comes to choosing the company to loan your money to. This will result in a high chance of you losing very large amounts of money. I personally think that people with lesser or no experience who want to try investing should invest in areas that are of lower risks, such as investing in the Singapore Savings Bonds.0 comments0"

I would not give you answer to your question but would like to ask you to ask yourself question:
How much are you willing to pay and prepare to lose in P2P Lending? 
Why do you choose to look at or even want to try p2p lending? 
How much have u researched on p2p lending?
Is it regulated? 
Are you comfortable with the platform?
Is there any measures the platform do to avoid default? 
What do they do in an event of default? 
Most importantly, what do you do in an event of default and after that? Are you prepared for the risk and even reduce those risk?For your last question,  think that is unlikely and it is mostly highly unlikely0 comments0"
6,"Luke HoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Jun 2018Horrible idea if you're a newbie. From my experience as an investment specialist offering multiple investment platforms, most peoples declared risk profile is very different from their actual risk profile. Losing or winning money in your first investment in a drastic manner could prompt your expectations in that manner. You might take on too much risk at the expense of your loved ones or too little risk at the expense of inflation. I usually start my first timers off with a classic, balanced fund with dividends. They can see their money grow and updates are forcibly sent to their doorstep. Once theyre sick of making small money, they can start to explore other options one step at a time. It also allows me to take responsibility and prep you on my advice, rather than read it online somewhere and have no one to blame but yourself.0 comments0"
