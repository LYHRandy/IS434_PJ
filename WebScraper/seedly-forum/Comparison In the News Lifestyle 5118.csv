WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019If you on no contract sim only plan, and don't mind holding unto 6 then keep using it since just change battery for another 2 year to save $. if you on contract and have sizable subsidies for buying new phone, then get iPhone XR, cheap and excellent phone. 4 comments0"
2,"See all 4 comments Leong Wen Fong24 Oct 2018LOL, CNET just said that iPhone XR is the best iphone value sia! looks like you're on point!HC Tang24 Oct 2018I been reading quite a few review before and after launch to review the product, everything same spec as iphone XS / XS Max except screen is LED instead of OLED, 1GB ram lessor but still faster than most android phone, and single camera at the back but still can take potrait photo for human (bokeh effect) but all these for only 3/4 the price! If not my telco subsidy is higher, I would wait and buy XR.  See this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4otE9sE0mQ&t=637s"
