1,"Javier Lim, Financial Consultant at Prudential Assurance Company SingaporeLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 28 Jul 2019It really depends, For SQ Business it would require 92k Miles (Europe) 99k Miles (USA East Coast) One Way Per Pax.So For a 2-Way ticket for 2 Pax it would cost 368k Miles For Europe and 396k Miles For USA; you have to pay for taxes with cashFor SQ Economy Class its about 152k For Europe and 160k For USA; though i much rather pay for an economy ticket rather than using miles to redeem them.So For Example, the UOB Privimiles card would earn you 1.4miles per dollar and you would need to have about $262,800 of eligible spending to earn 368k Miles, and about $108,500 to earn 152k Miles.You have to also consider how long would you take to earn those miles as the amount of miles required to redeem the ticket might increase overtime and if you can redeem your miles before they expire as well.https://www.singaporeair.com/saar5/pdf/ppsclub_krisflyer/charts/SQMI_AwardChart.pdfIt eventually boils down to how quickly and how much you spend.Personally i use iPaymy with a fee to earn extra miles for expenditures normally not accepted using creditcards.0 comments4"
