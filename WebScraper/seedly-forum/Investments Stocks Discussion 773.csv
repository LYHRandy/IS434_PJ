1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 25 Jul 2019As of 25 July 2019, this is what the stock price looks like:
It is currently trading under it's list price of $38 USD.Some other personal anecdotes:I use slack every single waking hour of my life (almost 6-7 days a week, for work related issues and it's really a solid work app)We are paying for every user and team member as awellIn our parent company ShopBack, there are over 300 plus employees all also on SlackIn the Singapore and regional tech startup world, almost all the companies I know of are also on Slack and we can't live without it. (quite a strong and powerful lock-in factor and defensible business in the enterprise SaaS space)Saw this very detailed explanation on Investopedia which I will reference below. The full source is on Investopedia.Slack Technologies Inc., a provider of cloud-based tools and services that facilitate workplace collaboration, will go public this week. The company filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 26, 2019. Several highly-touted IPOs already have hit the market, as tech-oriented private companies seek to go public while the major U.S. stock market indexes are at or near all-time highs. Key facts related to the Slack IPO are summarized in the tables below.Slack Technologies IPO: Key FactsTo be structured as a direct public offering (DPO)Existing privately-held shares will be sold to the publicThe market, not investment bankers, will determine the offering priceWill start trading on June 20 on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under symbol ""WORK""The company has received a reference price of $26 for each share, which would give the company a $15.7 billion valuationFinancial HighlightsRevenue of $400.6 million in fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2019Revenue up by 82% from prior fiscal yearLost $140.7 million in its latest fiscal year, versus $140.1 million in prior yearCash burn rate in the latest fiscal year was $97 millionNet losses exceed cash burn rate because customers pay up frontCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities: $841.1 millionUsage StatisticsDaily active users exceed 10 millionCollective weekly usage exceeds 1 billion messages and 50 million hoursTypical paid user connected for 9 hours on at least one device per work dayTypical paid user has over 90 minutes of active usage per work daySubscriber DataUsed by over 600,000 organizations with three or more employeesMore than 500,000 organizations are currently on a free subscription planMore than 95,000 organizations are Paid customers as of April 30, 2019.Paid customers increased by 49% in the latest fiscal year from prior yearPayment plans are monthly or annual, based on number of usersPaid customers include more than 65 companies in the Fortune 100Has 575 large customers that pay $100,000 or more annually, up by 93%The 575 big customers contributed 40% of total revenue in last fiscal yearSources: Form S-1 filing with the SEC, The Wall Street JournalChange of Strategic DirectionSlack is an example of a company that changed strategic direction as it grew. Starting out as a gaming firm called Tiny Speck in 2009, Slack eventually saw greater opportunity in commercializing the messaging software that it originally had developed strictly for internal use, as an alternative to traditional e-mail, the Journal notes.DPO vs. IPOBy choosing a direct public offering (DPO), Slack should save tens of millions of dollars in fees that otherwise would be paid to investment bankers, underwriters, and members of the selling syndicate in a typical IPO as described below, the Journal notes. Slack has engaged Morgan Stanley to advise market maker Citadel Securities LLC on setting an opening price for its shares, which will depend on buy and sell orders.Morgan Stanley played a similar role for music streaming service Spotify SA (SPOT), when that company went the DPO route in 2018, the Journal adds. As of the close on June 18, 2019, Spotify's shares were 9.8% below their opening price on their first day of trading, April 3, 2018, and 24.8% below their all-time high, which was reached in intraday trading on July 26, 2018.How Traditional IPOs DifferIn the vast majority of IPOs, a company that is going public engages an investment banking firm to manage the offering, estimating demand and setting the number of shares to be offered and the offering price accordingly. In any IPO of significant size, the lead investment banking firm will assemble a syndicate that includes other investment banking and broker-dealer firms that will line up buyers, among both retail and institutional investors.The two main categories of IPOs are best efforts and firm commitment deals. In a firm commitment deal, the investment bankers who underwrite it promise to raise a specific minimum amount for the issuer. By contrast, no such guarantee is made with respect to a best efforts deal. As a result, the fees paid by the issuing company to its underwriters on firm commitment deals are higher, to compensate for the added risk. By choosing a DPO, Slack essentially has opted for a low-cost version of a best efforts offering.2 comments2"

3,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 25 Jul 2019If price is undervalue and other indicator is healthy, I think is worth buying. I've been a user of both Slack and MS Team, though MS play the same old game to lock in enterprise user, use Windows and office to Monopolize enterprise market, now using office 365, their MS Team (Blatant copy of Slack) still sucks (lack of feature, lack of integration with external, buggy app) compare to slack. Furthermore, they have too much product overlapping,  eating into own family product market. In short, as the pioneer of such work suite to replace majority part of email , and with the current lock in client , I believe it has large potential to grow much much bigger than it it now and become one of the key biz communication provider of this century.0 comments0"
