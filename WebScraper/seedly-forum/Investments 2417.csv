While the below are good general guidelines, you may want to see a licensed professional like myself to customize your investment portfolio. https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.54You could read Rich Dad Poor Dad. Don't absorb it like the word of God, but it's certainly useful at teaching you what this is all about.0 comments1"

3,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I am not sure what you mean by 'set'. I assume you mean portfolio allocation.As a rule of thumb, the bond allocation in your portfolio should be equal to your age.For example, if you are 27 years old, you should have 27% bonds and 73% equities.If you are 75 years old, you should have 75% bonds and 25% equities.1 comment1"
