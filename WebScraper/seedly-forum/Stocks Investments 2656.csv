1,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Feb 2019Hello!You will need to look for a company that has consistent profits. Try looking for long-term earning growth expectation between 5% and 15%. Also, make sure the company has strong cash flow generation since cash flow is the one paying for the dividends. You should also  look for entities that have increased their dividend for five years or more. This greatly increases the odds of continued dividend growth. It is also important to check the industry health in order to see whether the industry is in a good position. Also stay away from dividened paying companies with excessice debt. Should the company have large debt it is likely that the extra cash will be used to pay off the debts instead of giving out divideneds. 0 comments2"

WizardAnswered on 25 Feb 2019You also would probably want companies that are paying dividends out by their normal operating activities, and not take on debt or have to sell its capital to simply fund dividend payout. One way you can do this in through look at Free Cashflow to Equity (FCFE).  Basically you would want their FCFE to be lesser than dividend payment and the cost to buy back shares, because that would show that the company is funding dividend payout or share buybacks by issuing more debt or existing capital or by issuing new securities.

3,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Feb 2019Hi anon,Regarding this, it would be encouraged to first understand the business model of the dividend stock, and how it sustains the high payout of dividends which it commits to.  A consistent stable historical payout is a good indicator of commitment to the dividend payout schedule for the stock.Cash flow growth and generation is also another good way of allowing you to pick stable healthy stocks. Yuo may have heard about the entire issue with Starhub and its high dividend payout amongst its high debt and low liquidity situation that has led to a selloff and dip in stock price, which essentially shows the importance of the long term stability and ability of the firm to fulfill and keep up with its dividend payouts. 0 comments0"
