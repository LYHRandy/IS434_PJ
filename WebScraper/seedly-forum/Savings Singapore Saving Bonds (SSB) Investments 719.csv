1,"PatLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 04 Aug 2019Hi! It is through the bank which you bought the SSB from.
Mine is through OCBC and basically you go to Singapore Government Securities under Invest, and instead of clicking ""Buy"" you click ""Redeem"". You can only ""withdraw"" within the working hours of SSB which is weekdays 9-5 I think hahah and if you are withdrawing it now i.e. early August, do note your money will only be back in your account next month :)0 comments2"
