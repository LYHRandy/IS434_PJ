question,"Hospitalisation Insurance (H&S) Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 19 Oct 2018Hi! May I ask, can someone who was clinically diagnosed with depression before get hospitalisation insurance?My friend was diagnosed when she was 16. She was put under some youth therapy programme till she was 18, and she discontinued it when asked if she wants to switch over to the adult programme. She has not had any relapses or medications for 10 years. Recently, she got a hospitalisation plan from AXA, but she did not declare her depression because she did not remember seeing any fields on the application form asking. Would any future claims be declined? Also, how can she work around this issue?4 answersAnswerBump0"

See what AXA says. Better now then when asking for a claim just for it to be denied later on.Usually depression can be a little tricky. If there are psych evaluation reports in your favour, it might help you with underwriting.It's not a clear reject case. 0 comments2"

GeniusAnswered on 28 Oct 2018The insurance company usually does not honour the claim if there has been a pre-existing condition that is not being declared.You should ask your friend to free-look the application if it's still within the 21-day free look period.Then subsequently ask her to submit a new application form to apply for this policy again.From my experience, when I submit hospitalisation insurance application for my clients, the company always DEFER the application for clients with depression history, and will usually wait out 6 months to 1 year before they check their medical condition again, and accept the policy, provided their medical reports satisfies the requirement that the insurance companies are happy with.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 28 Oct 2018One way is to check with AXA first.At the same time, she can apply for Aviva Moratorium Underwriting subjected to the actual diagnosis that the doctor gave as there are certain conditions that do not allow for moratorium underwriting.What such underwriting mean, in simple terms, is that if she doesn't display any symptoms or seek treatment for depression for the next 5 years, her conditions will be fully covered after that.Feel free to drop me a PM at www.facebook.com/brandan.chen if she would like to have further clarifications.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 20 Oct 2018Disclose immediately before any possibility of claims arise and the insurer void the policy due to non disclosure. Not sure what will the insurer do, as it varies between insurers, but always do full disclosure of all medical conditions when applying for any life and medical insurance products. Possible actions by the insurer will include acceptance with full coverage, acceptance with exclusion to depression related claims, or voiding of the policy. 0 comments1"
