You can also consider a private retirement plan, where you can customize when you want to get paid, how much you want to get paid and the rest without CPF changing the terms and conditions every time. https://www.moneymaverickofficial.com/posts/are-n-t-all-private-retirement-plans-terribleIf you want more money, you should just  invest it in a diversified portfolio aiming to make between 6 and 9% annualized net of fees, compared to the paltry amount that CPF is giving. I'm self employed, so I don't get CPF either and this strategy is working extremely well for me and will continue to do so. You can drop me a message either way, and I'll design something specifically tailored for your preference that makes you happier and wealthier. https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
