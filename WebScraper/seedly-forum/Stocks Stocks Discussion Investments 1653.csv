1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Apr 2019Hello! There's a large sentiment among the public that Uber is going to tank just like Lyft, as Isaac mentioned. However, I feel that Uber's IPO and Lyft's IPO are more different than similar! Lyft went public at around $25 billion market cap, whereas Uber is going to debut at around $120 billion dollar initial market cap. Uber also operates on an entirely different scale although currently it is still unprofitable. Uber has a bigger reach compared to Lyft, with presences in markets with huge potential such as freight shipping. Uber is constantly trying new things, UberEats which is a massive network in Uber, they recently purchased a bicycle rideshare company, _Jump _and have been pumping investments into incorporating driverless technology into their vehicles. TLDR: Difference in valuation, Lyft went public with an impressive valuation, however it pales in comparison to Uber's rumored valuation. Uber is expanding into markets that Lyft is not, making Uber more attractive to investors.0 comments6"
2,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 11 Apr 2019As Isaac and Sandra shared Lyft's poor start has definitely affected sentiment heading into Uber's IPO.Just read from https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-ipo-exclusive/exclusive-uber-plans-to-sell-around-10-billion-worth-of-stock-in-ipo-sources-idUSKCN1RM03L that Uber dropped 20$B in valuation justf from Lyft's poor IPO.Morgan Stanley being sued by Lyft for advocating a sell-side and Damodaran's assessment of Lyft being closer to $59 also doesnt help the case of Uber. Highly doubt the market sentiment will shift unless there's a big headline positive or quarter earnings improvement.Update: Saw this meme and I figured to share it here-""Scientists reveal to us the first ever image of a black hole""0 comments5"
3,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 10 Apr 2019I feel that is going to tank just like Lyft. From what I see tech industry seems quite overvalued based on market hype surround it. This overvaluation could have also occured during the private equity and VC funding rounds. Cases like Lyft, Theranos and other Silicon Valley unicorns could have generated too much hype, funding and valuation even to private investors based on the tech story that they are trying to sell. I read a pretty good article on this VC bubble recently in the Straits Times, which really sheds light on this tech bubble we are facing. (https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/coming-bust-in-venture-capital-spore-may-be-worst-hit)Some investors might be able to ride this bubble and make returns but I feel this is quite risky.0 comments5"
4,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 11 Apr 2019To be honest, with the way Lyft is going right now, I actually think the opinion that Uber's price will not drop after IPO is now becoming the contrarian opinion. It's hard not to see the similarities between Uber and Lyft, and even though the fact remains that Uber is much larger than lyft, these ride hailing companies constant competition with one another within emerging markets (arguably the place for the biggest organic growth) shows that the ride hailing competition is extremely fierce - and extremely costly. Uber isn't just fighting Lyft, they are fighting every single ride hailing app that exists within the local context of their markets. It's almost like a gladiator pit down there!I think just like Amazon, unless they can truly revolutionize once more and become the leaders of their industry, it is difficult to bet on any particular ride hailing company to succeed in 5 years or more. It will become another war of attrition just like between Grab and Uber in Singapore, and the last one standing is the one with more money to burn at this point in time.Uber will look to still remain unprofitable for quite some time given the competition it has, and I doubt that will really boost any investors confidence. I think once recession comes, the winner will finally be decided, when money dries up and business strategy is put to the test.0 comments4"
5,"Goh Kah KiatLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 12 Apr 2019It is difficult to make a case to invest in ride-sharing companies other than based on a hope that they’ll figure things out. Using the current business model, the more the ride-sharing company expands, the more money it loses. They have been able to survive so far thanks to venture capital backing. With the IPO, the bag is being passed on the retail investors.The main problem with ride-sharing companies is the lack of ”stickiness” or customer loyalty in their current business models. Consumers just book through the service that can get them from point A to B in the cheapest way. This means the only way to compete is through price wars and a race to the bottom.The only path to profitability I see is if the ride -sharing industry becomes a monopoly or at best a 2 player oligopoly. With anti-trust laws in place, I doubt this will be allowed.As such, until the industry dynamics changes or until ride-sharing companies find a new way of doing business, I am staying away.0 comments3"
