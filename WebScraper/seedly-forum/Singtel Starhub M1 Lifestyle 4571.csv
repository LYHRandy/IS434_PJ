1,"KAKhairudin AliLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered 2d agoIn my opinion, it boils down to individual preference. I would suggest you compare the prices among the 3 telcos. M1 might be the best from friends comments but me personally prefer singtel eventhough they have shitty customer service.Just make sure your telco bills falls within your monthly budget. That's much more important. Cheers!ðŸ˜„0 comments1"

I believe each CIS scheme is tied to the companies that offer them... eg your parent's or siblings companies.Alternatively you can also compare with the other sim only plans in the market, you may get a pretty good bang for your buck (in terms of data and talktime) as well!Here: https://seedly.sg/compare/sim-only-mobile-plans0 comments0"
