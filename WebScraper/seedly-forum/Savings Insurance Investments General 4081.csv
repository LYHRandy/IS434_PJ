Cyptocurrency is just an application which is build on blockchain technology. I prefer to call blockchain a transaction ledger in simplied term. ​​In future, I would like to see more application using blockchain technology as this means there will be more transparency in all the transaction which ever business is doing/making. For instance, in investment point of view, you may see companies' business transaction as an open ledger; perhaps in depth of who is their debtors or creditors. This will allow us to think twice/carefully on the potential of whether should we invest into this company in long term or short term. ​Bitcoins may be a hyde however blockchain technology is never a hyde.

MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019In the future I believe contracts and payments will be made in a flash using advance multi factor  biomatrix Authentication. This will be powered by block chain technology that would marry business IT systems together with bio technology. This is is the beauty of block chain to form and validate digital contracts 2 comments1"

5,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 09 Oct 2018IMHO, I belive the underlying tech still need some maturing.​The hype of bitcoin die down a little, its still more of a hype. But I don't see the rest of the blockchain being deploy very efficiently yet, still some teething issue to resolve and it's not even known by majority of the people out there. They only heard of crytocurrency but nobody really cares much or know much about blockchain.​​Hopefully the exiting incumbent matures more in the underlying tech, this way it can be applied to mainly Finance and also every business. I see it possible since we always need transaction record tracking, transaction history tracking, records validation. Blockchain is the basis for keeping track of data changes / information changes that requires authentication, thus I still believe it can be the basis for the transaction record tracking in the future of all trades / business.​​Just waiting for it's maturity :)0 comments1"
