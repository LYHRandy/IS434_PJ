4,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Love this question, mainly because I consider cost per use for purchases these days!Razer Phone (got this at a good price) - because I mainly use mobile payments these days. Metallic water bottle - possibly indestructible, so unless I lose it, I probably can use it for life. Comfortable shoes - so important if you are walking lots everyday. I tend to wear the same pair everyday - so I make sure I get a comfortable pair that I can move in. Currently I am wearing the Nike Flyknits, which I got at 50% off.1 comment0"
