ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi Anonymous, take a look at this.It shows that in 2015, 58% of members lost money with their CPF. BUT it also shows that in 2016, 78% of members made more than 2.5% What does this mean to you?
1) Investment has risk. You could lose. If you hate it, then stay safe with your CPF.
2) Investments need time to perform. One year you lose the next few you win. On a diversified approach, this is just to describe the journey. If you're now clear about whether it suits you and want to start, look to invest only the amounts above $20,000 for your CPFOA.

The great thing about it, is that any any time you're fearful, you can always exit your positions and start earning 2.5% interest again.And using the CPF approved funds, you can easily set up a globally diversified portfolio which can return you a 6-8% return per annum. 0 comments1"

Personally i invested some of my oa into REITs that are yielding at about 6% onwards. Do note that you can only invest the amount that is above the first 20k/40k for oa/sa respectively.0 comments0"

WonderkidAnswered on 27 Feb 2019Simply ask yourself 2 questions:1) Can you almost-guarantee earning than 2.5% pa  or even 4% in the long-run?2) How comfortable are you with losing your capital in the short-run for longer-term gains?If you are less risk averse and know suitable products that pays more returns that the cpf interest rates, why not go ahead, especially if you are young and have decades till retirement?:)I don't think you need to worry about investment experience/knowledge. Such things are easier learnt along the way.:)0 comments0"

If this is your first time investing, i would say, keep the money in cpf, and research on what is investment? Read up books, join courses, ask your investment savvy friends, bloggers, etc. Build up your knowledge so that you know what you are buying into, what’s the risk you are taking, etc etc Without any knowledge, without focusing on risk, and only focusing on returns, you will eventually set yourself up to lose most of your cpf. And no, i’m not fearmongering. I’m considering the worst case scenario whereby it is 100% capital loss. When one thinks about what to do with their retirement fund, better be safe. if you do have investment knowledge, and practical experience, then it may be a good time to use cpf to invest. main considerations include not needing the money soon, e.g. bto, getting higher returns that the guaranteed 2.5/3.5/4/5% that cpf gives, with relatively lesser risk.0 comments0"
