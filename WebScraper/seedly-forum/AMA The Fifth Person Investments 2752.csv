If passive income is important to you then income investing make more sense otherwise you will want toconsider growth or value investing. You can also mix strategy by having 70% income 30% growth/value or vice versa.0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 20 Feb 2019Know your personality with regards to how you handle money, whether you can take a loss, as well as your risk profile before starting out on anything. Understand why you need to invest as well. Get an emergency fund in place and while doing that, perhaps you may want to read deeper into the different types of investing as outlined by Richard and see if they fit your personality. Start small then go deeper once you are more comfortable anf confident 0 comments0"
3,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Feb 2019That's quite a broad and difficult question to answer. What you must first understand is what is your goal regarding doing investments and the risk that you are willing to take - Are you looking for long term, safe investments meant for your retirement, or are you specifically looking for ways to create relatively fast capital appreciation, which would be subject to greater risks? or a middle way between the two? this is the most important question we must ask ourselves first which tells us the type of asset classes we want to invest in and the type of investment strategy we want to mostly focus on. A basic breakdown of the 5 main types of investment strategies which can be commonly found in books and internet resources are listed below. 1)Growth Investing(Capital Appreciation Focus)Growth investing is somewhat different from value investing, in the sense it's focus is not about the valuation of the stock, but more of its above average growth potential in profits and revenue, which in turn should drive up the price of the stock. This method was largely used by Peter Lynch, whose growth investment strategy cemented his place as one of the legends of the investment and mutual fund world. This method is somewhat risky, in the sense that firms that exhibit such growth tend not to be as stable as your blue chip stocks.2) value investing (Buy undervalued stocks)this type of investment is largely made famous by Warren Buffet, but can be attributed to somewhat the ""founder"" of value investing, Benjamin Graham. Simply put, what value investing does is to buy stocks which are deemed to be ""underpriced"", meaning to be at a price below that which you think is the fair market value. This fair market value is determined via extensive fundamental analysis and research of the company, which I suggest looking up the many extensive resources provided by the libraries and websites such as Investopedia to obtain the necessary information to do so. But when you find such gold mines, you essentially will buy and hold them, possibly for long periods of time until it rises.3) income investing (Steady income payouts at regular periods)Income investing is relatively a stable and efficient method of wealth accumulation, whereby your investment portfolio contains securities such as bonds and high dividend payout stocks that payout at regular intervals, which is almost like your investment ""salary"". Such securities are like your bonds and REITs, and their attractive dividends and coupon payouts at a somewhat low risk allows you to more accurately plan for your expenses, especially for retirement.4) Small Cap Investing Small cap investing is essentially investing in small market capitalization firms (meaning that the valuation of their firms are quite small relative to other companies, perhaps from a few hundred million to 1 or 2 billion). Such smaller companies look quite attractive to investors because such smaller companies carry greater risks in investing in them - they have less information and are much more volatile in terms of performance as they are much more affected by movements in the market, lacking capital to buffer against potential shocks. However, this means that such companies go unnoticed, and experienced who are able to pick out these small cap firms are able to reap substantial profits in their investments when the firm starts to experience rapid growth.5) Socially Responsible Investing what this investing method means is to invest largely in sustainable, socially responsible companies that have a proven track record of thinking beyond profits to help play a part in helping the environment, the needy - maintaining social conciousness. This form of investing for investors also looks beyond purely capital gains and dividends, but to also ""support"" the socially responsible firms and ""boycott"" those that flout regulations regularly.TLDR: Understand your investment goals and timeline first, as well as your own personal risk tolerance, before jumping straight into the types of investment strategies listed. Of course, this list is not mutually exclusive nor exhaustive - you can be able to create your own type of investment strategy, or mix 2 or 3 in different proportions, but at the end of the day you must understand what you are buying into, and be willing to take the risks involved.0 comments0"
