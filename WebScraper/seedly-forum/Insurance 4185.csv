1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019See whether got limited payment options for the whole life plan. Whole life covers you for life and while the premiums might be high, if you can pay it off within a few years while you are still working using limited payment, why not? As some people point out, WL have CI coverage which is important during your retirement period.And since you are young, premiums for limited payment is still relatively affordable.Not asking you to drop term but a WL with limited payment is a very good addition to your insurance mix2 comments1"
2,"Ang Bing Xian14 Jun 2018Sorry, could you elaborate on what limited payment means? Do you mean non ILP? I'll definitely avoid ILP. Aik Kai18 Jun 2018Yes. They are non ilp. Basically instead of paying for life for WL, you pay only for a certain number of years. Like, you pay 20 years only for this WL plan and your coverage is till youe death. This helps in your retirement period whereby you are still covered but you are not paying anymore since you already paid finished"

7,"As DfLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 13 Jun 2018Ask them to give you an actual illustration instead of ""maybes"" and ""tiagong"". Compare it with a level term plan of the same amount taking time value of money into account.There will probably be some fudging about how you are also ""investing"" but just strip that out and look at guaranteed numbers.0 comments0"
8,"Hariz Arthur MaloyTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered on 13 Jun 2018Hi Anon, It's not a question of one over the other.I believe in getting WL for CI and ECI purposes and a top up of term for death coverage.The good thing about WL as well is that your death coverage gets inflation adjusted due to the savings element of the plan.Plus even if you decide to cancel your plan at retirement age, you'll get back more than what you put in. Probably more than twice your total premiums paid.0 comments0"
9,"Brandan ChenLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Jun 2018I am a financial planner with Manulife. I would suggest that since you are still young, couple your insurance policies with a combination of whole life for critical illness coverage and top up death coverage with term. Reason for doing so is that it may be more cost effective for you to take up a limited pay whole life rather than a term for critical illness coverageAt the end of the day, it boils down to your needs and budget.0 comments0"
10,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 13 Jun 2018If you believe in term, then go term.â€‹Any insurance will be cheaper the younger you buy. Even for term insurance, it will be cheaper if you buy younger.0 comments0"
11,"Hannah FooLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 14 Jun 2018However low the whole life premiums are, they are still more expensive than Term0 comments0"
