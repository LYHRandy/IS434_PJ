WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Yes you are allow to sign up many card, take the gifts since there's no rules of banning that and neither is it a crime. It's more of a business transactions of willing buyer willing seller. In this case, wiliing applicants willing card provider :P​The catch:1) Out of the 22++ cards that I've applied before over many years, for the cash back gift, it usually have min spending amount, within the 1st or first 2 months (or CTB to spend any amt for 6 months to get cash back gifts spread out in 6 months) to get the free gifrs or voucher.2) Those with singsavers who gives vouchers or other gift,  I recall don't have. ​However, I am sure that after you fulfill the above, you don't need to use the card at all.​Yes, signing many credit cards at once and then cancel all of it will affect the chances for loaning from bank in the future.​You can refer to points below to improve or have good credit scores:1. Check credit report and rectify any mistake.Free check at: https://www.creditbureau.com.sg/available-options.html​2. Pay any cc bills on time/all the time in full (not partial or min).​3. Avoid applying for multiple new cc within a short period of timeSometimes a few new credit applications will push you from a responsible consumer to an unreliable one from a bank’s point of view. And every bank has a different set of requirements and criteria to satisfy.Whenever you apply for new credit facilities, it would put enquiries against your credit report. Many enquiries within a short period of time can have an adverse effect on your credit score.​For your information, “Previous Enquiries” are retained on your credit report 2 years from the date of enquiry. So it takes a long time before the effect wears off.​4. keep your credit active​But if you do not use your credit, the banks cannot assess it. If you have “insufficient credit activity”, there is very limited information such as credit applications or accounts status history to derive a score.​5. Commit to keep it simple and improve your credit score​default records stay on your credit report for 3 years upon full or negotiated settlement, and bankruptcy data is retained for 5 years from the date of discharge.​It is ok if you have made mistakes before. But if you want to see the light of the tunnel, you know you have to commit to the following in the long term:​Check your credit report annually and rectify if there is any mistakePay your bills on time, all the time and keep your balances lowAvoid multiple new credit applications within a short period of timeKeep your credit activeAnd your credit score will work out fine.​​Tips: Read this hack on getting highest credit score in SG​https://www.singsaver.com.sg/blog/how-to-get-aa-credit-risk-grade-in-singapore2 comments3"

4,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Sep 2018Yes, you can sign up for all the cards. However, it does not make any financial sense to have so many cards at any one time.  Moreover, it affects your credit rating. 0 comments2"
5,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Sep 2018Short answer, no. You can sign up for all the credit cards, get the sign on bonus and throw the card in the drawer. Jus remember to cancel before the fee waiver period.However! You cannot just trust what is advertised. Please spend a bit of time to read the T&Cs, and see if you can hit the minimum spend to get the sign on bonus. I remember some banks require you to spend some money before they will give you the sign on bonus or they will claw back the bonus.With regard to credit score, just don cancel everything at one go.Hope this helps0 comments1"

8,"JianHao SooLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 19 Sep 2018Yup. It's a good method to gain all the welcome gifts from the banks as you are their ""new customers"". Do note that some banks has a requirement of at least 6 months before you can cancel their card. 0 comments1"
9,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 19 Sep 2018Based on what I know, I will try to explain how banks and Financial institutions make money from these cards and having seen it happen a few times with family members and also on the business front! There are two types of rewards:​1) Sign up reward​For these type literally when you sign up, you get a reward (be it some cashback or free cash or capitamall vouchers or miles). Most of the time, this is for first time customer, or what the industry defines as NC (new customers) to get your contact details so they can up-sell you more stuff in the future, eg other cards, loans etc. Then from there, you will be able to cancel if you want without spending (and make sure you do so) most of the time the card companies make it hard for you to cancel, some of them literally will beg you to think twice over and over again. eg AMEX and UOB. (lol literally last week). They will say... I can give you a special deal if you continue holding on to it... waive fees etc.​To be honest, if the card is still in your wallet, there is that slightest chance you may use it, hence the trick is to get into your wallet first. Thus often, the banks do not give rewards for second time customers.​The underlying concept here is how they make money... which is really surrounding the idea of late payments and crazily ridiculous interest rates at around 28% p.al. So be really careful and force yourself to cancel if you don't need it. Next is the 0.5 to 1% per annum if you spend at any outlets that the merchants will have to pay both the bank and payment processor (eg VISA or Mastercard).​2) First spend reward​For these, you will have to hit a min spend, I remember that time we got a card (not going to give the name here cos they discountinued it) but we had to spend $5,000 (and just nice we were going on a Holiday) to get a huge samsonite luggage, pretty good deal, so we just did it.​Same for Miles! We're thinking of getting a good card for our upcoming large spending at my wedding, so that one we'll have to spend also around 5k within the first 6 months which is likely possible, to get a reward of 30k miles. Pretty good deal!​Some food for thought :) do let me know if you have questions in the comments section below!0 comments1"
10,"Tang Ching PangLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 19 Sep 2018Thought of this question before. As far as I concern , cancelling credit card might effect credit score, besides,  you might have difficulty to apply the same bank when you actually need one. I do think occasionally you can apply one of them, maybe every half year . And when they unwilling to waive the annual fee, just cancel it. *Recently just apply ocbc card to get $50 cash credit. Haha. 0 comments1"
11,"Jeff Yeo,   amateur Social contributor  at School of social sharingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Sep 2018In a small way it affects your credit rating if you do not manage your credit cards well ​make sure to pay off all your credit card bills on time Do not take a loan if you do not need it I heard that cancelling the credit card that you hold for the longest time is bad -> I don’t see why or understand how this affects credit rating maybe it is not True. 0 comments1"
