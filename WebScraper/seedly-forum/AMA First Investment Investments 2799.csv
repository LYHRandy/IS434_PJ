1,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Feb 2019Hi!Just a small add on point as to how you could systematically research on individual stocks:1)  Macroeconomic AnalysisLooking at how current macroeconomic trends may affect future price movements for stocks eg: US-China Trade War? Brexit? Forecast of slower global GDP Growth by IMF?2) Industry AnalysisLooking at how the industry performance may be affected, perhaps due to global factors eg: oversupply of oil, leading to decreased profits for companies in the energy industry? Is this a dying industry?3) Fundamental AnalysisLooking at the specific company's health by looking at the ratios as suggested by the others. Hope this helps!​​​0 comments3"
2,"Isaac ChanLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 12 Feb 2019Hi there! The answers provided by the others are comprehensive, but I hope to stress this point, which is that cash is king! One of the most important factors in deciding what are good stocks, is how much cash the company is generating, and how much cash it is keeping. Without proper cashflow, it is needless to say that a company won’t be able to survive. But it is very important to also note that cashflow earned and retained does not equal net profit. Companies with strong net profits but with weak cash flows may collapse, simply because these are 2 are very different concepts. Net profit, to put it simplistically, is derived from revenue minus cost and expenses. However, a company also has other uses and sources of cash. For example, a company needs to repay loans, and invest in capital such as machinery and buildings. These uses of cash don’t necessarily show up in a company’s expenses. Moreover, a company might sell a product, but the customer of the company might only pay the company after a while (mostly 30-60 days later). This means that the company records that sale as revenue, but has not received actual cash from the customer yet. To look out for such factors, pay close attention to a company’s cashflow statements, since they show how cash is used and received, instead of just focusing on how much profit a company is earning. And remember, cash is king for any company!0 comments3"
3,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Feb 2019It depends whether you are in for the long term or just for short term trading. I prefer the former which is towards value investing.The following are some pointers which I look out for:1) Industry - Is it a growing industry with huge growth potential? Does the industry have a high barrier of entry? Is this industry easily disrupted?2) Company - Does this company has a unique value proposition? Does this company has any unfair advantage towards it's competitors?3) Price to book Ratio 4) PE ratio relative to it's competitors in the same industry5) Cash flow - How much emphasis does the company place in investments for the future? Is the company operating cashflow positive? Is the company paying too much in debt?6) Debt to Asset/equity relative to it's competitors in the same industryThese are just some pointers that I look at before deciding to invest in any particular companies.0 comments2"
4,"Gibson JunxunLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 02 Feb 2019I would think that finding a stock/ business that you’re interested in and that the business is something that you can understand is very important. Cause if you don’t understand how the company makes it money, you wont know whether is it growing or losing money.Knowing when to buy in would then come next0 comments1"

Find the brands, the companies behind them and whether they are listed and start from there. Great brands create a moat by themselves and will grow over time 0 comments1"
6,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 31 Jan 2019There are many school of thoughts in investment.Though the more prominent and safer way is to do value investingYou look at the P/B, P/E, NAV, company financial (whether it has enough FCF free cash flow), is it earning money, is it a sunset industry or not? How would commodities and other futures/Contracts affect it? Company CEO has track records for business? The safer investment are those that have less variable (but also less growth normally).I let the experts chip in as my understanding is still basic and more on short term trades. 0 comments0"
