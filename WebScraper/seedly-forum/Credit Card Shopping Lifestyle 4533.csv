A number of miles credit cards have decent signup bonuses which will be easily met with your $10K spend. However, do choose your card carefully as the miles earning rate/transfer partner/validity of the miles will vary from card to card. Take some time to do your research.0 comments5"

I personally used to use SCB Cashback for the cashback as I am lazy of tracking my miles. Now it's probably Citibank Premier Miles or UOB Priv Miles for my miles accumulation.0 comments1"
