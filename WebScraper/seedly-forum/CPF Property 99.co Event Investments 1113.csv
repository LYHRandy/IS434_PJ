1,"Vincent Tan Wen Bin, Assistant Vice President at Thinkers AllianceLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019If I am intending to use the money to purchase a house, I wouldn't aggressively transfer my funds over to my SA. If you are taking an approach that you would want to build your SA to hit the minimum sum fast, by all means do the transfer. If you are still thinking to purchase a property, you might want to be careful on the top up. Funds transferred from OA to SA is permanent and irreversible. I won't wnat to be caught in the situation when I want to purchase a property and I have all my money in SA locked up for retirement. If you have some spare in your OA, by all means do up some transfer to maximize yield. Just have to ensure you got sufficient spare in OA when you want to purchase your property.3 comments2"

If the objective is to get a 2nd property, you have to take note on what is the amount that you have to set aside. Assuming you want to get a 2nd property without selling off your first property and the value of the property you are getting is $1.5million. Excluding ABSD and BSD. You have to set aside $375,000 and $75,000 must be cash and $300,000 can be contributed from CPF OA and the rest of the 75% can be loaned from the bank.Vincent Tan Wen Bin28 May 2019Amount will be higher if you include the BSD and ABSD. So if you reverse calculate the amount you need in 5 years time from your OA, you will be able to decide how much or whether do you want to transfer your OA to SA. Hope this info is helpful."

However, don’t do it if you’d be on a shoestring budget without savings.One common issue of people who do this is that, when things go wrong, they start resorting to credit cards and personal loans; this would defeat the entire purpose.You can read more abour prepping for your first home on the 99.co blog!0 comments0"
4,"Siow NanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 Jun 2019I did top up from OA to SA to max up the FRS earlier. Looking back from my experience, here are some things that I might do slightly differently. 1) Since you have 5 years to go, you do not need to quickly top up to the max FRS so early.  Plus for doing so is that you can gain on the 4% interests and typically they will cover the yearly FRS limit increment subsequently.  Down side is once you have max up your FRS, you cannot contribute any more top ups in the subsequent years, so you will need to plan how to invest the spare cash. 2) Spreading up your yearly cash top ups, eg up to 7000 SGD yearly limit can allow you for tax rebates.  If you max up your FRS fast, you cannot top up further and get this tax rebates3) Overflows from SA will NOT go into your OA. I miscalculated as well earlier.  Overflows from MA will first go to SA, then to OA once FRS is reached. You will still contribute to SA even after your FRS is hit.  So only your OA will have MA overflows to it.
4) I would use cash to pay for my mortgage like you did now as well. If you have cash, then why don't you use it to fully repay your existing mortgage unless you can get better returns from it vs the current interest rates or OA rate.0 comments0"
