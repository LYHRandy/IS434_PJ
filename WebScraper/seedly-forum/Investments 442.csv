Grand MasterAnswered 4w agoI will use the money in SRS to buy stocks or REITs for the long term.The bank you are with does have a stock/fund scheme for your money in their SRS bank accounts. Do check out some low fees, or blue-chip stocks for your long term investment. You are right, $4k is not high, but keeping it to work is good. It will incentivise you to continue saving money into your SRS too.0 comments0"

With such a long time frame, it is best to stick to stock investing. ETF is recommended unless you are a good stock picker, then active ivnesting is good for you0 comments0"
