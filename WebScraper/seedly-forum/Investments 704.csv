question,"Investments Asked by Kaushik IlangoAsked on 09 Aug 2019What should a student working part time and making about $1000/month invest his money in? Need some financial planning advice, thanks in advance!?I am currently a second year medical student at NUS and I work for my parents company during my free time. However I would like to have a lot more financial independence as well as have a good foundation for the future. I would really like to have a stable passive income that I can rely on.1 answerAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 09 Aug 2019You're probably really young, I'd focus instead on accumulating my wealth and reinvesting dividends from now until my 40s to 50s where I will then start changing my strategy to a more income/distributing strategy.So with that 1000/mth, I'd suggest investing in a globally diversified portfolio, preferably something more adventurous/aggressive for the next 10-15 years minimally.0 comments2"
