1,"Christopher HowLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 11 Jun 2018I'd suggest to always start with a HDB loan.​1) If you start with a bank loan, you can never switch over to HDB loan. If you start with a HDB loan, you can refinance with a bank loan.2) The downpayment required if you take HDB loan is 10% (cpf and/or cash) whereas downpayment is more if taking a bank loan:20% of purchase price for loan ceiling of 80%5% in cashBalance using CPF OA savings40% of purchase price for loan ceiling of 60%10% in cashBalance using CPF OA savingsRemaining amount for loan ceiling of 50% or lower20% in cashNote that you will also need to pay another 5% in cash during the key collectionBalance using CPF OA savingsSource for #2: http://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/new/finance/costs-and-fees0 comments5"
2,"Rave Ong Ci DeLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 18 Jun 2018HDB loan better. In the worst case scenario, when one can’t finance the mortgage (retrenchment, hospitalised due to accidents, etc), HDB is unlikely to evict you to force sell the property. Banks however, are will do so. Yes and no, for the part on the paying off as much loan as possible. This depends on what kinds of returns you can consistently make with the ”spare cash”. If you can consistently make more than the loan interest rates, you should not pay off the loan that quickly. If you cannot, perhaps it is better off reducing the % of loan. Also, if you used your CPF for either loans, remember you have to factor for accrued interests. Most importantly, it depends on whether you will have a peace of mind with either options. 0 comments1"

4,"Andrew LimLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 12 Jun 2018i will think HDB loans if you are looking for 20 years period.. bank loans are more for 10 years or less (less risk in interest fluctuations)? CPF earns interest, so keep some inside....for retirement0 comments1"
5,Alan SeowLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 11 Jun 2018If you feel interest rates would go up. I suggest a HDB loan. If you were to go for a bank loan. I suggest having a fixed interest rate loan for the first few years for certainty of cashflow. 0 comments1

8,"Amanda Ho, Financial Planner at AXALevel 2. RookieAnswered on 21 Sep 2018Hi there, would recommend you to take up HDB loan (2.6%) instead of wipping out your CPF OA account if you can. Keep at least 20,000K in your CPF OA account as interest rates will be at 3.5% instead of 2.5% when CPF-OA account drops below 20,000K.​3.5%-2.6%=0.9%With that you can actually be ""earning"" 0.9% with the remaining amount in your OA account to ""pay off"" your HDB loan. ​Hope it helps :)0 comments0"
