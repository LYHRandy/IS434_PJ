God of WisdomAnswered 1d agoHi anon, I would suggest you sit down and have a heart to heart with your boyfriend.One of the most common reasons for a relationship or marriage failing tends to be over money issues. It's important to have a common understanding on how both of you will manage money when things get serious. (e.g. buying a flat, staying together, having children) I would not go as far as to say it is a big red flag, but it is one of the many factors that may potentially contribute to stress on a relationship.To improve the situation, he needs to understand his own expenditure habits. Start by tracking where his expenditure goes to. This is where the seedly app might help, although for people like myself (I have been tracking for 10 years now), excel is my preferred method due to my strange fascination on plotting pivot tables, colourful pie charts and analyzing how much I spend on KOI bubble tea vs LiHo. But you get my point.With some figures in mind, encourage him to setup a saving account where he transfers some money into every month after salary comes in. Even $50 is better than nothing. Then use the money to pay off all outstanding debt. The goal is to reduce all debt to $0 first (especially the credit card), which will put him in a better position financially to contemplate the next steps such as marriage/starting a family.It's never a good idea to pay credit card bills by installment as the interest is high and is one of the surest paths to financial ruin. You can explain to him that you would like to help him improve his financial standing, as I can't imagine anyone saying no to having more money in the bank.$1K/mth on insurance is a little excessive. Based on my own 4-3-2-1 expense rule and his take home of $250/mth, he shouldn't be spending more than $250/mth cash on insurance, and probably a maximum of $500/mth going to investments and savings. But $500/mth on investments and savings can be started later on. Clear all debt first and have an emergency savings of 6 to 12 monthsTo put it in perspective, if $1K/mth is not too much, then ask him to calculate how long he'll last if he is out of a job. That should give him an idea of his financial standing and hopefully lead to an epiphany of sorts, and some form of action, hopefully.I can't comment on what his mom is doing, unfortunately. I'm not aunt agony nor do I profess to be. I can only give your logical and practical advice on the financial side of things. However, if he shows commitment to take action, I would say that is a positive development.I wish you all the best in helping your boyfriend improve his finances. Please feel free to ask further questions if you require. All the best!0 comments4"
2,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusAnswered 18h agoThe biggest issue I see with what you have described is the credit card payment. How you should tackle the issue is take the annual interest, convert it to monthly, and show him how much interest he is paying per month. At this junction, based on the circumstances I am helping friends understand their credit card debt trap...if the credit card / lines total balances  3 mths, and = 12 mths of take-home pay, the situtation is very very bad. You wont be paying this down comfortably in less than 6-7 years. Best to cut the cards, get debt consolidation loan, and aggressively pay it down.if credit card / lines total balance >= 18 mths of take home pay... I think they should apply for bankruptcy. The hole is too deep to get out of easily. There will be a lot of pain, and repayment could take as long as 1.3 x 6 x (debt / mths of take-home pay) mths. Not a pretty picture.The 2nd might be more insurance than he can afford, but this would reduce as his pay goes up. So for time being, I wont see it as an issue, though I would recommend keeping insurance costs below 12.5% of take home pay. But there are people who feel more comfortable with endowments.0 comments0"
