1,"Yeap Ming FengLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 15 Apr 2018For a start, I would not outright recommend Robo-advisor alone for beginners. I believe that everyone should have a portfolio of different products to diversify their risk.As much as Robo-advisors allow a low cost and certain degree of diversification, it will be good to really understand where all the money is going to and how else can you enhance it. I am currently on Stashaway to give myself a little bit of exposure to the overseas market. This is however, only after I have a little bit of Singapore Savings Bonds and STI ETF and of course, insurance coverage. As beginner, it is good to build a good base of stable, low-risk investment products, which at the moment, I would not be considering Robo-advisors as low risk yet. 0 comments3"

Unlike traditional funds, they have less fees and easier to use product2) Which to consider:
There are 3 main contenders in Singapore: Stashaway, AutoWealth and Smartly. The other 2 are by older players in the market: FSM MAPS and POEMS SMART.Each has their own pros and cons. I'm personally on Stashaway, but so far the returns have not been great due to a pretty bad market since the turn of 2018. Till date, my returns have been -1.5% as it has been up and down. But at the end of the day, I plan to Hold on for almost 10 years (a long duration) so let's see!But I would highly recommend you to read a few things:The intro to Robo-advisors in Singapore: https://blog.seedly.sg/singapore-robo-advisor-investment-comparison/For you to read real reviews of Robo-advisors: https://seedly.sg/reviews/robo-advisors 0 comments0"
