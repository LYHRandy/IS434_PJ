With so many people selling their investment strategies, it really becomes difficult to find who is the best among them. I agree they should sell their strategies to hedge funds to make millions. One of the reasons they avoid doing it is because they are actually not sure about their own strategies. They are just there to make easy money by fooling others that their strategies are great for others and they should buy it.0 comments0"
