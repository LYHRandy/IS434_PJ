Annuities are an important puzzle piece in a retiree's portfolio. And they are usually better when purchased earlier. There are many lifetime income annuities now that pay a % of your capital for life with 0 drawdown of your capital unlike CPF Life.If you'd like a comparison, do let me know. There are single premium ones, regular premium ones, different payout schemes, etc. I'll need to know what exactly you're looking for but I can show you all the products that are available in the market.0 comments0"
