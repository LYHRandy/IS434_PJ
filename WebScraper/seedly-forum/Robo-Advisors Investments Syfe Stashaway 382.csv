Does it still make sense to use DBS Invest-Saver?I'm currently using StashAway and Syfe as my Robos (most aggressive portfolios) and exposure to international ETFs. Does it still make sense to use DBS Invest-Saver at least for exposure to the SG market? https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/investments/investing-in-funds/invest-saver2 answersAnswerBump1

1,"Angeline TeoLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 15 Sep 2019I would say each Robo-advisors is already diversified.... don't over diversify by spreading to too many Robo-advisors too.Overspreading wastes your time in looking at so many different advisors and then thinking hard whether to switch when 1 is doing better than another. (and then after you switch, the other does better and you wonder again....)Stick to the 2 you chose and spend the time enjoying life ;)0 comments1"
