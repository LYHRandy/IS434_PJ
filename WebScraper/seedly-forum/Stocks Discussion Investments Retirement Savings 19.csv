1,"Dhruv Arora, Founder & Chief Executive Officer at SyfeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 5. GeniusUpdated 3w agoHi anon, as you look deeper into this topic, perhaps I can share more about Syfe's proprietary investment methodology ARI (Automated Risk-managed Investing). Simply put, ARI helps investors achieve better risk-adjusted returns by keeping their portfolio risk in line with their risk level.Your Syfe investing journey starts with you taking our Risk Assessment to better understand your risk profile. ARI then builds you a personalised investment portfolio, allocating assets which have shown the best return for your risk profile. Thereafter, ARI continually monitors your portfolio to keep your portfolio risk in line with your desired risk level.For instance, during periods where higher market volatility has been forecasted, ARI will adjust your portfolio allocation and reduce your exposure to higher-risk asset classes. This ensures your portfolio risk stays aligned to your desired risk level. Conversely, during periods of market calm, ARI will adjust your portfolio allocation to include more higher-risk assets. Your overall portfolio risk is still kept in line with your desired risk exposure, but you capture the market upside as well.What is truly distinctive about ARI is how it provides better risk-adjusted returns, no matter what market conditions may be. You may view our backtested returns during specific events such as the 2008 financial crisis here.Regarding Syfe's ETF investment universe, they include ETFs from multiple asset classes covering 20 sectors across more than 15 countries, as shown in the image below. You're also free to deposit and withdraw any amount you prefer – anytime – with no additional charges. So yes, investing $200 per month is definitely possible with Syfe.If you'd like to find out more, please feel free to join our weekly investing workshops!

6,Kishor BhagwatLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 3w agoThe main difference is their strategy. You will need to decide which one makes more sense to you but it's not easy to do that for a layman. No point investing in both unless you are simply comparing.0 comments0
7,"SLSamuel Lee, Financial Planner at Advisor Alliance Group (AIA)Level 3. WonderkidAnswered 3w agoHi, do remember that most robo-advisors will invest in a basket of ETFs and funds for you. How they usually perform their adjustments is usually a proprietary secret. (I suspect we can only know if their algorithms are really effective after seeing historical data of their results post different phases of market conditions)
Two things we can openly observe is the portfolio that the respective companies will invest in as well as the management fees.
Decide if the portfolio they will be investing in is something that you personally agree with - you may have overlapping funds that you have already invested and that defeats the purpose of diversification with robo-advisors right?
Management fees are also a fixed cost (while market returns are usually a volatile number). I would personally prefer investments of similar instruments with the lower management fees!0 comments0"
