1,"DeleteEditKenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 18 Apr 2019If you are reading this, chances are, you are considering the next step on your investing journey and deciding whether to pay a few hundred dollars to be taught a session on investing.Particular to the above mentioned FifthPerson Dividends Machine course, it costs close to $469 SGD to attend the course and it’s run only once or twice in the year.Full disclosure:__We were invited to a FifthPerson class on one Saturday to share our experience. Of which, I will give my full unbiased review here from an attendee POV before breaking down what you should be looking for and what the course is NOT.If you are keen to read more crowd-sourced community reviews from Seedly community, you can jump ahead here.TL;DR Summary: YES I would recommend this for the average Singaporean investor (who is starved for time)It is better to spend this $469 for an intermediate course to learn about investing for someone who is starting with a clean stateThere is a comprehensive online series of content which you can consume in your own time over the weekendsNot forgetting that there is a really good offline workshop which you can attend (for as many times as you like when they run the course yearly)You also get a really comprehensive thick booklet with the course material covered that dayHowever, this is NOT a course which you’ll get immediate stock tips and a watchlist (for that you’ll have to pay for the Dividends Machine next level which I did not get)This course is good for:People who are complete beginners to investingYou can easily earn that amount back in dividends in 2 to 3 yearsIf you are looking to do DIY investing (and not the other passive ETFs or index investing etc)This course is NOT good for:People who just want an easy way to get a list of stocks to buySomeone who is just keen to get positive returns (all the time)You’ll still need to do effort and work on what they teach you before you make the right decisions for the long gameWhat happens after the course:Yes, I did something. I sold of my loser stocks (which I realised why it was a bad decision to begin with)And now have a better plan when it comes to dealing with market crashes and learnt some strategies to deploy capitalI got very interested in AGMs, and thus started attending some of them these few weeks. We wrote about it recently here.Conclusion: Good for beginners to inetermediate InvestorsSo all in all, thanks Dividend Machines! And Fifthperson, you may be keen to check out other community reviews, and understand what others are saying about their program.Victor, Rusmin and Adam are really great guys with a strong passion for investing and they do what they preach. The hallmark of a real educator in my humble opinion.0 comments5"

It doesnt take rocket science to build a simple dividend portfolio.If DIY is not your thing, go for plans instead. Even with the overheads included in the plans, it save you time so that you can focus on other things more important in life.0 comments1"

I like that there are unlimited resits for free and there's also online support and self learning through the portal. And the price is not too expensive either. For someone who has been investing in reits for some years, it's an eye opener to how they select stocks. Certainly can use this material to do a better filtering and when to buy/hold.0 comments0"
