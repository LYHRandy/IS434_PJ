1,"Clarence Chua, Financial Planning Specialist at Prudential Assurance SingaporeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterAnswered on 22 May 2019Will anyone be splitting the mortgage with you? 3k a month is a bit of a stretch when it comes to mortgage payment.A simple way to keep track if you are ready to own a property is when your mortgage do not exceed 40% of your income. (I recommend to keep it in the 30-35% range)If you are using it for rent, rental income must be higher than the mortgage you are paying.0 comments3"
2,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 21 May 2019How much is the condo you have in mind? I agree with Gabriel that you might be stretching it abit with 3k a month - do consider payments especially in the case where job is not there any more. Would you have enough to service the mortgage?Additionally, will it be for yourself to stay, or looking to rent? If the latter, consider rental yield.0 comments3"
3,"Vincent Tan Wen Bin, Assistant Vice President at Thinkers AllianceLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 22 May 2019Not sure about what price point would you be going for your condo. If we use $1 million as illustration. You would need $50,000 cash payable by cash compulsory, $200,000 either Cash or CPF OA. The rest of of $750,000 will be able to take a loan subjected to the TDSR (Total Debt Servicing Ratio) If you are keen to explore more, do reply to my message and let's discuss more.0 comments1"

5,"Siow NanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Good to know that you have high aspirations at a young age!That's a neat sum of savings as well and it will certainly help you to get invested. Give me a ring or whatsapp @97649657 and I can share my journey with you if you like. The information that you have shared is too little to make a proper suggestion or advice at the moment, so it will require further discussions at least over a drink.9 comments0"
6,"See all 9 comments Siow Nan24 May 2019Then I presume that you have already considered your future possible requirements for a matrimonial home already. There are definitely options available and it might be good to discuss further on your wealth planning needs, with an overview of your total portfolio.Siow Nan24 May 2019Other questions to consider, eg are you solely focused on getting quick rental yield returns, or would also consider potential capital gains from your property investment? Have you considered reits too as an alternative for direct property ownership?"
