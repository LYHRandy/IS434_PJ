MasterAnswered on 21 Sep 2018Your take home pay will be $2400 with an annual tax of $410.For a single income earner, this amount might be a stretch if you got high loans to pay.If you had no loans for now, u have to focus on savings.You can adjust your family lifestyle to a more frugal one like eat at home more often.Getting parent to help might be an option for you since you are the only bread winner and I assume you do give your parents allowances.If u dun give ur parent allowances, tt means u might have to seek a higher paying job bcos you are really struggling to survive and your family follows you.All in all, there are many way to plot out how to control your spending, save and refinance if any to help you save more.If you believe in enjoying and giving ur family the best with ur future and their future at risk, then the result might be painful.Staying together and going thru thick and thin together will make the family stronger when you are a good father and son.Hope my reply helps.If you feel this reply have Quality, please upvote and check other Quality Reply.https://seedly.sg/profile/a-kenichi-xiThank you.0 comments1"

WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I'm sorry about the situations and also our system is not fair to single parent, where living in a high living cost society, single parent were still being penalize with no CDA, no subsidy, no tax rebates is given though 1 or 2 MP has bee fighting for it.Let's just hope that one day situations change for the better and be fair to single parent.A few things can be done as shared by my friend:Check out Ministry of Social and Family and find as much financial assistant as possible: https://www.msf.gov.sg/assistance/pages/default.aspx?topicID=2Apply for the blue CHAS card for defraying some medical (GP/Specialist/Dental cost): https://www.chas.sg/Default.aspxP/S: Not a lot but ranges from $15 to $35 (not sure the upper limit) but at least some help monthly.If your kid still very young, can sign up for NTUC Good Start bundle for some goodie bags of rice, formula and some other goodies:https://www.chas.sg/Default.aspxand child care subsidies and assistance:https://www.ecda.gov.sg/Parents/Pages/CCLS_HomeParentsSubsidies.aspx#ChildCare%E2%80%8BInfantCareSubsidyIf kid is in kindergarden, can apply for KIFAS to defray cost : https://www.ecda.gov.sg/Parents/Pages/FAQs-on-Kindergarten-Fee-Assistance-Scheme-(KiFAS).aspx

Finance Budget:Assume that you'll be living one roof with your parents on have the whole flat by yourself (fully paid for) or with maintenance income:Below is the breakdown on how to manage 2 preschool kids with 3k income:Summary:Note: Costing is based an article by Dollar and Sense.(1) Expenses for 1 preschool child = Orange $340 . So can x 2 if is 2 child and row 12 $85 for some etc cost to be shared by 2 kid.(2) Basic protection for yourself at row 13 - Term insurance for you, and good to have accident / term insurance for kid (as a add on / tag to your insurance as a rider) is also important as it is the basic protections.(3) Savings as row 15 though only manages $400 ( to save at least 6 months of total expenses as emergency savings). Can be subsides by year end AWS or bonus of 2 to 3 month worth of salary less CPF(4) Monthly direct investment (not ILP) is minimum for those Regular Savings Plan (RSP) such as POSB invest savers or others of your choice to have some investment for future.(5) Do save up the year end AWS or bonus of 2 to 3 month worth of salary less CPF for the purposed shared in red.As you can see above it is still possibel to manage 2 preschool kid with 3k income alone. If you have to pay for HDB flat, can use CPF OA to pay for but try to avoid as much as possible so that when retire you have $ for yourself and when kids grow up, can use some of the funds as study loan for Poly / Uni. Furthermore, in OA it also earns 2.5% to 3.5% interest.Hope this is good information for you.Happy Parenting :)2 comments0"

4,"Loh Tat Tian, Complex Manager at Ocean Ifm Pte LtdLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Sep 2018As a Sole breadwinner,Your take home income is $2,400 each month. You definitely need a 10% savings if possible.
So you are left with $2,160.00 a month.1) work with your spouse and children on budgets. 2) Set aside all the fixed expenses like (A) Home expenses - electric bills, water, telco (internet only for entertainment)
(B) Food can be home prepared (exchange of time with money)
(C) Balance the need for time and money.3) Control Variable expenses with the family helpEncourage them to think of ways to do it together. Kids can learn some art crafts or technical tools, help out with housework so it lightens your wife load (so she can focus on more difficult task).(4) set aside 1 hour a day for self improvement. Be it for a side hustle or reading books. No matter what, money is not enough until a certain threshold where you are financially secured.Hope this helps (general advise as I do not know your strength and weakness)0 comments0"
5,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019My dad is the sole breadwinner of my family, with 2 kids. His take home pay is about $3000, and my mum is a housewife = $0 income. An advice would be to cook whenever you can. It'd be cheaper than eating out, especially if you cook often (so ingredients can be shared between days).I would also suggest not having a car/expensive telco plans/TV subscription plans etc.Also make sure your kids know the importance of moeny, so they will not spend unnecessary :)4 comments0"

7,"Yu EnLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 22 Sep 2018If you're Singaporean, apply for the CHAS card for the entire family. That will help with medical and dental expenses. Explore ways to increase income. Upgrade yourself by picking up more skills, using skills future, reading books related to your profession/industry. See if its possible to look out for higher paying job. Reduce expenses. Use an app to track expenses. Cut down on unnecessary expenses. Focus on saving rather than investment for the time being. Make sure you have an emergency funds and insurance sorted out since you are the sole breadwinner. 0 comments0"
