2,"Julie TanLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 08 Nov 2018I saw bulk buy crabtree and evelyn handcreams on Qoo10 during some Black Friday/Singles day promo last year. Works out to be within your budget. I think handcreams are pretty practical, but not sure if that's what you are looking for. Other stuff like stationery should be afforable as well. 0 comments0"
