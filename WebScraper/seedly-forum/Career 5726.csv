1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hmm ideally you shouldn't lie. Think about it, for every hiring manager worth his or her salt, they would be able to tell if you are lying or not sincere. If you want a better job or better benefits, then ultimately you would have to show why the company should hire you over the other candidates. If you prove to be an invaluable asset, you can get the better benefits at any company that recognizes the value you bring to the table.2 comments1"
2,"Question Poster05 Jun 2019Hmm but i dont know why i want to join a specific company though....i just know i want to upgrade from SME to MNC...any MNC doesnt matter to meJunus Eu05 Jun 2019Why exactly do you want to join an MNC? Because there are also people in MNCs who want to join smaller companies, because they feel that they can add more impact to a smaller organisation, as opposed to being a COG in a big machine."
3,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Brand names with naturally be associated with bigger companies(?).I really don't think you should have this pernicious mindset and lie to enter the company. Yes, there's bigger perks associated with larger companies. But how much effort and time will you spend to keep that facade up? Is the energy wasted worth it? The rewards you get is synonymous to how much effort you put in. If you want better incentives, keep upgrading yourself so that you will able to move to a bigger company.At the same time, we shouldnt be shortsighted and only look at the gains. Larger companies also look for results. If you are unable to deliver them because you do not meet the job requirement, losing the job will stain your portfolio permanently (hard to lie about this).An alternative is to politely discuss about the possibility of other benefits with your current boss, though unless there's results or compassion, the likelihood is slim.The rest is up to you to make your prudent judgement. All the best ahead!2 comments1"
4,"Question Poster05 Jun 2019Yea big brand names, MNCs are definitely what I want to try to get into. SME benefits in SG is really sucks. That's the reason why i dont care which company, just MNC, big company, big name can already. Hard to think of why join a specific brand name kind of questionLok Yang Teng05 Jun 2019The benefits are quite obviously incomparable to each other. However, is that your sole motivation at work? If it is, I urge you to reconsider. Thereâ€™s no free meal in this world and the benefits come with a cost. Lying may come at a bigger cost than proving your abilities through results."
5,WnkLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 04 Jun 2019Hi Anonymous! You donâ€™t have to tell a lie at all! You have to be sincere in an interview - your hiring managers can see past lies. You just have to phrase your answer in a more palatable way i.e. Your Company is the leading brand in the industry and I will be really proud to work for an establishment that runs at the forefront of the industry. I can see myself working hard for your company and to grow together with. There you go! You do not have to mention the benefits and all. It comes with it ðŸ˜‰0 comments1

7,Jacq NgLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Are the benefits the only factor that makes you want to apply to the company? Focus on what other factors that attracts you to click that apply button and you will not need to lie in any way..2 comments0
8,"Question Poster05 Jun 2019Better benefits are my only concern though...SME benefits are shitty in SG. Even leave entitlement is 12 day haha...MNC I think minimum is 16-18 days. Plus my SME no medial claimsJacq Ng05 Jun 2019I see.. but in terms of the role that you will be applying for? i think you can focus on what you can bring to the company during the interviews.. in this case, you will not need to lie in any way.. :)"
9,"Justin Kieran OngLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 04 Jun 2019Like what some of the others have said, the best would be to lie.That being said, you obviously think they are a good, or at least better, company so would it be a lie to say you're looking for new opportunities to apply yourself?Also, a bigger company usually comes with more situations that you won't get in a smaller company. So would it be possible be a lie to say you look forward to overcoming new challenges as I'm assuming thar you don't intent to just slack in the new company.It's all about positioning and marketing yourself. With the right words, you can make something as self centered as I want more money into I'm looking towards the future and think that your company would be a better fit for me in the long term.Good luck.0 comments0"
