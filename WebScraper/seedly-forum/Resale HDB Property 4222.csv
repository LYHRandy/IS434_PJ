question,"Resale HDB Property Asked by AnonymousAsked 4w agoHow do I calculate the highest price of resale HDB I can afford? Assuming I don’t want to fork out any cash for the down payment?Since we are aiming to not use any cash, just fully CPF, we’ll most probably be taking a HDB loan. Just received our HLE and not sure if HLE amount is 90% of the total price or 90% after deduction from grants. Ie. HLE = $480k~Total income = $7k~Grants = $90k (4room resale: $50k, EHG: $20k, Proximity: $20k)Thanks, community!1 answerAnswerBump0"

Grand MasterAnswered 4w agoHDB loan = up to 90% of the value can be loanedBank loans = up to 75% can be loaned.I personally prefer bank loans because the interest rate (best currently is 1.89% for first year) is way lower than HDB 2.6%Let's use HDB loan for now since you can use the lowest downpayment of 10%, and 100% of this downpayment can be from your CPF.So how much CPF-OA both your spouse and you have?If you have, say $50,000 combined, then that is the maximum you can use to pay for the downpayment (the 10%) so that means the maximum flat you can buy is $500,000.No cash.A simple formula for HDB loan  = whatever you have in CPF X 10 = maximum flat you can buy (i am ignoring your income assessment, just based on downpayment affordability)If you want to use a bank loan for long term financial savvy, great for you. Downpayment is 25%, 2.5 times of HDB loan. And 20% of the flat value can be paid by CPF, but 5% downpayment MUST BE BY CASH.I chose a bank loan because the interest rate difference is large. But if you need cash, the HDB loan is more useful for you.2 comments1"
2,"Question Poster4w agoThank you so much for your response!
It makes a lot of sense to me! 
We did thought about bank loans but the uncertainty of interest rates is quite daunting. From you experience, did the bank loan interest rates exceed the HDB one?Cedric Jamie Soh4w agoBank interest rates has been lower than HDB loan as long as i can remember. And going by American fed expectation, i still think interest rates are expected to stay low or go even lower. do note, however this is not a 100% sure thing :)"
