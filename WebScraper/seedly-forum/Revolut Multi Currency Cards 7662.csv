1,"SLSamuel Lee, Financial Planner at Advisor Alliance Group (AIA)Level 3. WonderkidAnswered 2w agoFrom Revolut:Client funds are safeguarded at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Singapore Branch. Your money is not covered by the Deposit Insurance Scheme. As an authorised institution, Revolut safeguards your funds as per regulatory requirements. In the event of an insolvency of Revolut, you will be able to claim your funds from this segregated account and your claim will be paid above all other creditors.Note that this means it is not confirmed that we will get our funds back in the event that Revolut closes down. accordingly.0 comments2"
2,"Kelly Trinh, Technical services at financial services firmLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated 1d agoAs mentioned elsewhere, balances aren't covered by SDIC, so there is some level of due diligence required on Revolut as a counterparty in case they run into difficulties.That's the technical side, but on the general life side, how should this affect behaviour towards Revolut.The MAS regulations that Revolut operate under (see below; heavy reading but the FAQ section is informative) look fairly consistent with worldwide best practice. https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/acts/payment-services-act
Given that funds are separately held and not commingled with Revolut's cash used for general business operations, I wouldn't worry too much (but at the same time I am not going to be keeping with them large amounts - you don't get any interest after all !)0 comments1"
