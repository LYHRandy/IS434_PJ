1,"Xinyi Lum, Content Strategist at SeedlyLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 03 May 2019Hey! Are you asking with regards to the Seedly expense tracker? As we are a Singapore-centric budgeting app, the currency is in SGD. However! You have the flexibility of keying in transactions in MYR (amongst a list of many other currencies) and have it converted into SGD all within the app to best reflect the total balances :)Hope this helps!0 comments1"
