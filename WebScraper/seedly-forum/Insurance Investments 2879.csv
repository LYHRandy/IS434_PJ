MasterAnswered on 22 Jan 2019Imho,Your insurance should cover all the basics required.Minimally, Health insurance is the most important (as hospital bills are largely the one that could cause catastrophic risk to the finances of the personal finance).The rest really depends on your needs. You could diversify to a few investment depending on your risk appetite.Not limited but includingStocks picking (high risk)Robo-advisors / ETF dollar cost averaging (medium risk due to the etf)Or just stash up enough in a highest interest savings account to build up both your capital and investment knowledge.0 comments0"

3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Jan 2019Always sort out your medical / protection needs first. Unless your investment portfolio is in the 6-7 figure range and you feel you don't need insurance. Basic plans to look into are hospitalisation, death, tpd and critical illness coverage. Personal accident as well if you have some spare funds. These will cover the basic stuff if anything were to happen to you in terms of hospitalisation or major illnesses / physical impairment. Hope this helps 0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 21 Jan 2019If you have the essential insurance already and an emergency fund, I would say just use it to invest. Theres a lot of things you can invest depending on your how much volatility and risk you are willing to take. If dont like to take risk, can put into SSBs. Able to take risk can put into STI ETF or even overseas ETFs.0 comments0"
