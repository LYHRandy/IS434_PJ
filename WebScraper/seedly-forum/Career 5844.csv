2,"DeleteEditHC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 30 Dec 2018Continue your data Science, if you can go for PHD go for it. It's a niche now. Check when your company give out bonuses, after that will be the time people would quit and time for you to move to the company of your choice. Meanwhile, as you land in a stable good company, quickly go for your degree and gain more exposure and experience by doing side gig on data science. It helps! work hard! Cheers! 0 comments1"
