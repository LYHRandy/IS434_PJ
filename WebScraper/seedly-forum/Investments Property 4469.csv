question,"Investments Property Asked by AnonymousAsked on 24 Oct 2018With the recent property cooling measures. Do you think that property is still a viable option for a middle aged couple as an investment vehicle?My wife and I are both around 35 years old and have 2 kids who are in primary school. We are thinking of selling our BTO and moving into a private property (condo) both as a place to stay and potentially looking at capital gains. However, with the recent cooling measures, wonder what people here think if it is still a good strategy to adopt? or continue staying in our BTO and invest in stocks.5 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Nicholas Woon, Marketing Director at ERA Realty Network Pte LtdLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 29 Oct 2018The resale value of MOP HDB goes down in general if you choose to delay the sale of your HDB. The best time to take profit is once your HDB reaches MOP. Since you’d be selling your HDB, then you’d be considered first timer for private properties and do not need to pay ABSD. There is much more capital appreciation potential for you as compared with people who pay ABSD for the property. Having said that, I would diversify the cash proceed from the sale of your BTO into other asset classes like stocks as well. In the long run, the capital appreciation potential of a private condo would be more substantial than your current BTO. 0 comments1"

What you need is to get yourself educated in property investment or stocks investment, whichever that you feel you are not so familiar with, rather than relying on all the heresay around you.0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 24 Oct 2018I would only personally get a private property if the cost of the property is not more than 5-7X my household income and if I can place a downpayment of at least 50% upfront.If not, I'd rather look for more liquid options. 0 comments0"
