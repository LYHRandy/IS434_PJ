question,"Investments Loans Savings Asked by Takingstock @Asked on 16 Jun 2019Which is better, paying down property loan or investing, if I am recycling the savings from cutting out expenses / unbudgeted salary increments?I am negotiating for loan refinancing. My loan interest crept up to 2.74%, but I expect this will come down over the next 6 months. My cash investments are doing about 5 to 5.8% dividend yield, but that's still less than half the monthly interest (in $$) I am paying on the loan.Very undecided. It seems better for me to stop buying SSBs and just throw these to pay down the loan. I can't decide if its better to stop using the dividends to reinvest or pay down the loan.2 answersAnswerBump1"

1,"Siow Nan, Electrical And Computer Engineering at NusLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 17 Jun 2019If you are using money from ssb @ around 2% to pay off loans with interests of 2.74%..then it can be considered.
If you have additional cash able to generate consistent 5 to 5.8% dividends... Then why use them to pay off a 2.74% interest? You can enjoy the leverage still and liquidity of funds if needed. 
Importantly, make sure you still have sufficient emergency reserves if you choose to redeem your loan. Pros you get ease of mind and can consider to switch job etc easier if you have a lower loan commitment. But if you have a better way to gain additional interest above the loan interest, then why not make use of this leverage? You can also consider refinancing to lower your loan interest rates as well.4 comments1"

I should hit FRS next yr, so the OA will be balanced between investments and padding on the reserve against the loan. Just hope the rates come down ans I dont need to activate the buffers.

3,"Charmaine Ng, The Value Maximizer at @ Every Ma La Xiang Guo StallLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 17 Jun 2019I would use the money to pay down the loan. If it doesn’t fully pay down the loan - you’re still paying interests.. best to eradicate the need to pay interest in the first place.11 comments1"
4,"See all 11 comments T@Takingstock @16 Jun 2019Anyway 8% is pretty hard to do for dividend yield, so I guess Tat Tian is referring to capital gain alone. I only plan for cash dividends to offset my expenses and cashflow (in case I get retrenched). 

If I continue with my current strategy, the dividends inflow will not offset the interest outflow until at least another 5 years. Not that paying the loan down will make it much better either.Loh Tat Tian17 Jun 2019It doesn't matter whether its capital gain or dividend anyway.. If you are able to use investment return to pay off the loan, its a win to me.

You can extrapolate the returns and see how fast you can pay off your money. Compare 5% to 2.5%. The number of years required to double is different.

Imaging you have 50k now growing at 5%, versus a 100k loan at 2.5%.
