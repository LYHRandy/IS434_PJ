question,"Bank Account Asked by AnonymousAsked on 29 Oct 2018Iâ€™ve just started a sole proprietorship. I want to separate business profits and personal savings. Should I open a corporate account or use my DBS multi currency account to receive all revenues?Just require an account which I receive payment and deposit cash sales (Amt is 10k per month), after which I will split up the revenue into CIMB fastsaver, STI index etc. I would also want to make use of UEN PayNow, which could be linked to the DBS multi currency account.1 answerAnswerBump0"
