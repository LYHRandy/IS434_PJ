1,"Charmaine Lim XiaomeiLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 1d agoIMHO, the best time to stock up on toothbrushes is when you travel.Hotels, most full service carriers and airline lounges provide toiletries (such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, razor, combs, shampoo, conditioner, body wash etc) for free.Malaysia and CK department store are pretty cheap places to stock up on household items too!0 comments1"

I feel you too! While I can't answer why toothbrushes are so expensive in FairPrice, I can recommend a few places you can get them for cheap!
Depending on which one is the most convenient for you: Pink Beauty/Venus (They've got a few outlets and I think they're usually side-by-side)Swanston (Chinatown) Ocean Cosmetics (Chinatown)MustafaCK Department Store
Otherwise, do check out Lazada, Shopee and other e-commerce sites for good deals too!
Hope this helps!1 comment0"
