1) attend HPB workouts. Under their Sunrise in the City programme, there are alot of classes by alot of studios/gyms all over sg. Sign up for the mailing list so you know when the booking window opens, cuz popular slots like weekend workouts get snapped up really fast!2) use your ActiveSG dollars if yours are still valid. Some people's expire alr.3) if you need help getting out of bed for exercise, wear your workout clothes to sleep.  Once you wake up next morning you're almost ready to go!4) if nice workout clothes motivate you, then just buy them. But don't buy too many lah. Look out for sales at your favourite brand, check out outlet stores, and maybe go jb/usa buy. I generally refuse to buy workout clothes at their original price. 5) follow your favourite brands on social media. They often have free events that you can work out at, and most would come with some sort of discount for their products. And you'll also know when the sales are, for Point 4 abv.6) download fitness apps and subscribe to fitness youtube channels so you can workout whenever wherever. I like the rockstar fit app by Natalie Dau, videos by blogilates (Cassey Ho) and Emi Wong are cool too, and a tabata counter app helps time my tabata workouts at home.7) make your steps count! Apps that reward you for simply walking include the AIA vitality and HPB healthy 365. 8) if you need motivation to run, sign up for virtual races with 42race. Normal virtual races usually cost just $9.90 for various distances, and they mail a medal to your home. The medal designs are always quite thoughtful! You may also sign up for free virtual races, those come w virtual medals. And most races come w lucky draws too!9) when on holiday, make use of the hotel gym  or find a fitness class nearby. Exercise in the morning e.g. sunrise yoga by the beach, and carry on your vacation after that! 10) check out parks and nature reserves in sg instead of walking in shopping malls.11) find a fitness buddy because exercises are usually more fun to do w a friend. Sometimes got 1-for-1 deals too.12) make use of free/cheap trials to workout and to explore gyms! Examples are fitness first, pure yoga, guavapass, classpass.13) find sports teams to join so you have some community support, and that would most likely push you to work harder. Check out running teams like running department, adidas runners,  the high panters etc. For other sports, check out USports. If your company has sports interest groups too then just join!14) Check if your company has corporate rates for gyms. Could save you quite abit if you're alr thinking of signing up!Diet: 
1) hydrate mostly w water. Bring a full water bottle out and refill wherever since sg tap water is fine. 2) working out more often will likely make you hungry easily, so stash aside some nuts for a healthy cheap snack. Buy no-brand ones weighed out for you at bugis market, or maybe wet markets near your home will have too.3) research on whether popular supplements like protein shakes, BCAA etc will rly help in your workout. Quite likely you're not working out at the intensity that justifies buying such pro stuff.4) no need to buy expensive healthy/clean food like daily cut/ommivore/whatever. Modify your favourite hawker food like more veg/less rice/whole grain, or try food prepping. I'm a cheapo lazy bum so i usually just go to a cai png stall that doesn't look too oily.5) But if you really want actual healthy food, usual cheap food hacks apply too--shop at clearance aisles, use entertainer/burpple beyond apps. Im quite glad that Wafuken is on entertainer!6) treat yourself when you're really craving for sth. Like, if you want a coke just do the normal coke, don't do coke light/zero cuz the satisfaction level is different. If you want a latte just do full cream milk cuz it's nicer and you're not saving very many calories by switching to skinny anw. You'll be miserable/angsty if you keep forcing yourself to eat clean all the time. Your healthy lifestyle should be one that's sustainable. Have fun!0 comments4"

4,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019A topic close to my heart! I do think that fitness should come at an affordable price, and actually feel that Singapore is a great place to do so!What I do daily:1. 30 burpees - it is a full body strength training exercise and a good example of functional fitness2. Drink lots of water 3. Walk as much as I can. Singapore is an amazing city to walk in - the whole section around the Marina Bay area is one, for example.Apart from the water, the above 3 points are basically free ;)1 comment2"

(e.g. NTUC UTAP, SkiillsFuture $500, SkillsFuture Qualifications Awards)Bodyfree programmes (SITC) and company-subsidised programmes (lunch workouts for $5/session!)apple cider vinegar+honey+cinnamon+lemon in the morung for detox. be mindful of your appetite as it increases appetite, esp initially. can buy apple cider for about $7-8 per 900+ml bottle on qoo10 when on offer. drink lots of water to dilute the acid thereafter!drink more water, reduce snacking, eat more fruits and vegetablesSoulI try to do some mindfulness meditation daily using free apps when commuting in the morning1 comment2"

8,"Wesley EeLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 13 Sep 2018Leverage on technology by tracking calorie intake and activity apps Eg. Myfitnesspal, mapmyrun. Fancy salads can be substituted with your humble fish soup - veggie and white fish in soup = salad soup?? High nutrition content yet not as painful on the wallet. ​Weight training can be substituted with a proper program using the neighbourhood fitness corner. ​As with finances - if you track you finances to achieve progress, why do you not track your caloric intake and activity to hit your fitness goals?0 comments2"

10,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusUpdated on 22 Jun 2019Hmmm, I have done some stuff together to cut calories and spending at the same time1) cut sugar. My personal rule is anything with more than 12% sugar (when viewed by grams or ml) is automatically out. Unless its ice-cream and I happen to be on leave or special occassion.2) change my daily wake up coffee to be kopi o siew dai, or teh si gosong (down from normal kopi). Normal kopi has added sugar and condensed milk which also contains sugar. Save at least 10 cents per drink, and the rate of weight gain slowed tremendously.3) try to replace snacks with fruits (good ones). Fruits cost more but you also tend to eat less as they contain more natural calories, with the vitamins and fiber. Less processed food.4) if you can afford a few extra min, alight one to two stops early from the bus and just increase the walking. Minor savings in fares perhaps, but only slight change to lifestyle while adding a bit more exercise. Feel free to extend the no. of stops if you can take it.5) generally more efficient  to cut the calories from eating vs trying to add a lot more exercise, ie cutting average daily intake from 5000 cal to 3000 cal is much less effort than increasing exercise time by 10+ hrs per wk to burn extra calories. Still good to exercise a few hrs per wk, but the extra calories are like debt, its really hard to clear it while its still piling on...6) sleep more. Sleep seems to consume a fair bit of calories for body to repair itself, and less wake time = less eating. Sometimes I think its just that we are tired and eating to keep ourselves awake but the body just needs to rest and convert eaten food to energy, not eat more.0 comments1"
11,"Ronald SzieLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 20 Jun 2019If you stay in the west, do go use the new ActiveSG gym at Jurong Lake Gardens (take a bus from Lakeside MRT and it's along Yuan Ching Road). The equipment are nice and clean (cushions not soaked in perspiration and not rusty) and a good variety of machines to train. Best of all, it's only $2.50 per entry, same as other ActiveSG gyms.0 comments1"
12,"Teresa WuLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 16 Sep 2018Join kfit or guavapass! Their late cancellation charge will give you no choice but to turn the class itself. 😂
10 classes a month is quite doable for those who are starting out and the best part is that you can try many different types of exercises with professional supervison. The last thing you would want is to injure yourself while getting yourself started on a more active lifestyle.
All the best!0 comments1"
13,"Jeff Yeo,   amateur Social contributor  at School of social sharingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018Meal prep your lunch for 4-5 days in advance bring it to work. You get two benefits your own controlled diet + cost savings when you buy in bulkDont buy drinks. Bring your own water bottleskip the Starbucks! A lot of them are liquid junk food  drink your own freeze dry coffee with fresh milki go to the gym daily in the morning so showering at the gym saves the home water bill and you get your work out down first thing in the morningchange the fries, rice, bread when eating out to boiled or steam veg skip the fruit juices ! It’s just sugar water, eat the fruits instead if you gym, buy your own protein powder and bring it along. Skip the expensive protein drinks and bars that are soldin stores 0 comments1"
14,"Elsa GohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 13 Sep 2018Ignore diets with fancy names, need you to google, or which need you to count calories. They are difficult to follow and have little to no scientific backing (blog articles that try to dumb down scientific studies don't count as scientific backing, im looking at you keto diets).Eat at regular mealtimes. Don't snack.Sleep more.See no. 1.0 comments1"
15,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 20 Jun 2019First off, I feel that we are extremely fortunate to be in Singapore. Because, for some reason we have a system that has given us NO EXCUSE to not be healthier... personally I really think this way! (no political or biased opinion here) Let me cite some examples.​Fitness:Every Singaporean has ActiveSG credits ($100) which alot of people don't even know about (in an app with a Singpass login)The gyms that these places offer actually are very decent with functioning machines and some even offer free classesFor guys, there is the EnergyOne gyms at SAFRA which will allow you to use also at a decent affordable monthly subscription rateI was getting my BTO recently and studied floorplans, so many fitness corners and running paths designed for everyone to keep fit (from young to old)Gyms are everywhere (paid and unpaid ones) if you have more money to spend on classes you can use apps like Guavapass or KFIT and a newly launched MasterpassFor guys, you should aim to get at least a pass with incentive for your IPPT yearly which gives you $200! Not too bad bonus just by running some days and doing some basic weight exercises!Diet:2 Eggs at a coffee shop or hawker will cost you between $1 to $1.50Buy the 7-11 chicken thigh, this will cost you around $3 to $4 and makes a good meal (along with the eggs)Go to Cold Storage to buy the roast chicken, which will cost you around $4 to $5 (for a whole chicken)Buy milk x 2 cartons (to save on some cost)For veg, you can either choose to meal prep or just get salad combos on a normal dayJust for an example:​This is how Toa Payoh ActiveSG gym looks like (photo below, taken last night)! I get it that not all neighbourhoods are like this, but to be fair, I've been to Potong Pasir CC gym as well (Which is entirely free also, if you live there) Very good!​Looks almost like any gym membership which would cost you anywhere between $1500 to $2000 a year, but this one is only $2.50 per entry! :)​0 comments1"

18,"Jay Liu, Diploma in Accountancy  at KHEALevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018Was a gymer in the past before I injured my shoulder and become fat now. So 1. Calculate your daily macros intake. How much protein,  carbs, oils your body need per day. 2. Execute a meal plan for yourself. Meat options like chicken breast, fish. Cooking yourself is cheaper and healthier. No msg etc. Try to really run instead of going to the gym using the treadmill. Vice versa with cycling.  Buy ACTIVESG membership instead of paying per entry if you are frequent user. 0 comments0"
19,"Charmaine Ng, The Code Breaker at @ Every Chye Peng StallLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018I've been doing these recently:cutting down sugary drinks (Starbucks down first... then now bubble tea!) Not yet totally off the addiction but at least I'm not buying it daily or even twice daily! Expected savings: $50/month at least.​Using the AIA vitality app! So far been on it for 2 weeks and earned $10. So tempting to blow it off on Starbucks but I'd be saving it to get healthy products for my upcoming meal prep! (Instant office soup lunch~). I am expecting the whole meal prep to cost me max $2.50 per meal with all the ingredients I love and the vitality programme allows me to enjoy some good discounts (15%?) on healthy products + the earned voucher so far would help subsidize around 4 of my meals! Meal prep is also going to help with my health since I can decide the amount of sugar/oil/salt that goes in.​I'm not a gym person but I try to walk home when I could.. thats a $-2 or $-10 (if you talk about grabbing) per trip.​Cutting down on outings/gatherings. Outings/gatherings should be meaningful and  turning up for every single gathering or dinner isn't financially smart (especially when spent on less than worthwhile food you could easily cook up). I believe you need to pick your war; and same goes for social niceties to maximize your finance, time and energy. I calculated this actually helped me save more than $150/mth (imagine one outing costs $50!!)​If friends are just up to meet each other it can be easily done through food court and hawker centres and let's not forget celebrations = eat more = lesser time for exercise = fat = gym = money lesser due to getting a gym pass which I'd not utilized = poorer = more indulgence. That's a vicious cycle right there! XD​watching my purchases in view of lesser wastage for groceries (no biscuits/snacks/chocolates whatsoever till the pantry is empty) and holding back that piece of cake from rive saves me approx. $40/month.0 comments0"
