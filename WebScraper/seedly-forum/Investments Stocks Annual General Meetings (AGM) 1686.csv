question,"Investments Stocks Annual General Meetings (AGM) Asked by AnonymousAsked on 08 Apr 2019Is it important to attend the Annual General Meetings (AGM)s by companies you bought stocks in. What happens there?I recently received a bunch of annual reports in the mail, some of which are my parents and some are mine. I hardly see them go down for the AGM and I also hardly hear my peers who just started investing go down to these AGMs. So I wonder how important is it to go or not?4 answersAnswerBump0"

MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi there, I would strongly recommend you to attend if the stock you've bought is a sizeable one, its really interesting to listen to questions raised by others and how the management of the company answers them. The main reason why people attend AGM's is to interact with the management. I've heard questions such as why don't the company increase frequency of dividends (their dividend payout was on a yearly basis), how they intend to mitigate risks moving forward, how does one justify director fees given poor performance by the company. It's akin to interacting with the Annual Report of the company, just that this time round, its a responsive one.1 comment4"
