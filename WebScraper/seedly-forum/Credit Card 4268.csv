1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 03 Nov 2018Hi Anon! Thanks for bringing this up :) I fully understand where you are coming from and while I agree with you that there are indeed many repeated questions, we can actually do a much better job to make sure that the people who need help (askers) find the answers they need quicker as well.Our design and product team is hard at work making this happen so no worries :)To your second question, we actually made the call to remove ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù as there is not much meaning to a ‚Ä¢General question.what we have done instead is to better categorise topics which you will see very often now also!0 comments2"

But I'm learning. 2 comments2
