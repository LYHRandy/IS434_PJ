ProdigyAnswered on 21 Feb 2019Hi,Investor used to purchase First REITs because they collect their rental in Singapore dollar despite depreciation of Rupiah. The agreement is about to end soon and when that happen there is high probability that it will re-rate to the current exchange rate which then causing a decrease in dividend. Based on your three companies, in term of sector wise, seem like a good mix.0 comments2"
