1,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 21 Nov 2018As a fresh grad, focus on the most important insurance first(1) Hospitalisation insurance. Its cheap, and most likely the possible wealth killer if you ever got into accident or fall very sick.(2) A Whole Life insurance with Critical illness cover (Early CI) (please check the conditions covered). possible(3) Term insurance for the rest for the coverage gap needed. You still have time to think through until you reach 30, but please do some scenario planning. (out of job, going to married, housing, baby?). these milestone will change the coverage you need. I opted for max coverage first.(4) Disability insurance. Something which is good to have imo unless you are earning at least $6,000.00 per month (which may make sense to insure since no job can pay you $6k easily, if you got involved in accident etc).(5) Accident policy. Good to have to top it up in case your TPD is a result from the accident.You need hospitalisation insurance the most. The rest needs further anaylsis before it is a want or a need.0 comments0"

3,"Loo Cheng Chuan, Founder at 1M65 MovementLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I am not a big believer of buying life insurance or ILPs. I believe in Term Insurance with adequate coverage, one should focus on investments. Do not mix protection with growing wealth. Once I have become comfortable financially, I will kill all my insurance plans (which I have already done at this point of time).2 comments0"
4,"Pat08 Nov 2018Hi just to clarify, you have cancelled your term insurance but are you still under a hospitalisation and/or critical illness policy? Thanks!Jim Ng11 Nov 2018When you say you'll kill all your insurance plans when you're comfortable financially, does that include your Integrated Shield Plan?"

God of WisdomAnswered on 07 Nov 2018Once you're employed you should look at:Ugrading your Medishield Life to an Integrated Shield Plan for Private Hospital Stay10 Years of your annual income as Life Insurance for death cover3 to 5 Years of your annual income as Income Protection in the event of Critical Illness.I would tag the CI Cover on a whole life and the rest as Term till Retirement Age.0 comments0"
