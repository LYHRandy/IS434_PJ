1,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 14 Nov 2018I do not think that is a right comparison. I assume when u say 'invest with insurance company' means buying a policy underwritten by the company? Personally, I do not advocate investing through an insurer. The cost structure is much higher doing it this way. There are several DIY platforms out there with minimum cost.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 15 Nov 20181) Before we even begin, I'm thinking maybe you can let us know why are you even considering the 2?2) Its important to understand both underlying risk.3) Insurance has too many products. When you said Investing, which products are you referring to? If its ILP, there are also different ILPs (traditional Timebomb which includes protection), and ILPs which are hybrid endowments and funds, or pure funds?They both have different fee structure and the complexity differs.4) Investing in an ETF has less headache, but same as ILPs that are funds, you could lose the entire investment. That's why I'm worried about you not understanding the risk first.0 comments0"
