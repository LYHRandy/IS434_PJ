2,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Apr 2019Definitely for sure.From a financial planning perspective, Marriage, besides the legal bond of your LOVE relationship, is also the begining of a financial relationship.Imagine if one is married to someone with a pile of credit card debts which was unknown to the other half prior to marriage. It would be hard to make any plans for family planning (babies), buying a house, owning a car, etc.Marriage is also about the pooling of resoures together to better both lives. Savings/ Investments - It is important to know how much each party has so that one can make plans for retirement, buying of a property, renovation, raising kids etc.Insurance - It is very important to get your financial planner to prepare a summary of your insurance policies so that both parties are aware of the coverage that each party has. On top of which, it would be good to also do up a nomination for life insurance so that there would be lesser disputes should any unforeseen circumstances crop up.Assets: Both parties should be clear of each other's assets and make sure that the Assets do not actually turn out to be liabilities. Imagine finding out that your future husband/wife has 3 properties but have difficulty in renting them out. This instantly turns an asset to a liability.On top of being financially transparent, it would be important that both can contribute to a joint account to fund whatever family expenses that are required. Preferably that the contribution amount be discussed beforehand and that GIRO standing instructions are set up the moment your pay cheque comes in.0 comments3"
3,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Apr 2019You definitely should. Marriage is a forever thing where you will be trusting one another for the entire life. Not being clear with finance might be bad in the future when the other finds out that you hide from him/her whether its because you have a lot of debts or you hiding money from him/her. Few months ago, I went for a couple personal finance event and a relationship advisor mentioned that around 50% of couples that went for her help in their relationship problems were related to money.Its better to be honest from the start than hiding it from one another. So that you and your partner can work together as a team.0 comments1"
