Given that you're working full time while taking up a diploma course, you might not have time to take on additional part time jobs. So maybe you can consider other alternatives like dropshipping0 comments2"

Give yourself a fixed pocket money, say $100 per week and do not exceed it.As for part time jobs, you seem quite fussy about it. Nonetheless, you can look for those warehousing/packing type of jobs for part time.As for skills, perhaps you can look through what courses you can apply for using Skillsfuture credits. Most importantly, you must have the passion and interest for it0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 09 Nov 2018You can use the 70-20-10 rule to budget out your salary.70%  for monthly expenses 20% for savings, unless you have pressing debt10% for investments, retirement,so effectively you'll be saving 30%, about $420 per month. Making your own meals, bringing water bottle when eating out, can add up to huge savings! I'm not too sure how to go about with increasing income though. 0 comments1"

Don’t understimate Grab deliver. They can earn more than $2k/mth. You may dislike it but simple as them can earn more than you!3) Invest portion of your money. Returns will get in the future but definitely will benefit youYou cannot belittle jobs such as tution and driver jobs! Did you know Tution in Singapore is increasing because Singaporean parents are “FOMO”. It is a billion dollar demand!!! Imagine GRAB. More of the business owners nowadays are using delivery platforms to get more sales!0 comments0

GeniusAnswered on 21 Jan 2019I’d think it’ll be better for you to focus your non-work time on your dip rather than work more.therefore you should try saving up instead. But what are you actually saving up for? Maybe first up is to save an emergency fund of 3-6months your income? Try this needs-wants method:Needs: Work out how much you must spend each month, e.g. transport expenses, basic food costs, bills etc. Wants: Then decide how much you want to let yourself spend on stuff like new clothes, shoes, gatherings etc. Once you’re adding up the amounts here you’ll likely realise how much money you can actually save if you spend less on things you don’t actually need. Your savings would be the leftover amount when you deduct your needs and wants from your take home pay. Since you said you have no savings, it’s most likely that your wants are too high. Are there some stuff that you can spend less on? Maybe don’t shop so much? Or maybe your needs are too expensive? Are you Grabbing instead of taking public transport? Would a SIM-only phone plan be better for you than a usual conttract plan? If you’re smoking, would you consider quitting smoking?0 comments0"
