ProdigyAnswered 3w agoHi,Saxo is different from StashAway & MoneyOwl, StashAway & MoneyOwl are Robo-advisors where they decide the ETF for you based on your risk. As for Saxo, they are a brokerage, just a middleman to help you buy the stock of your choice, beat to use them for U.S stocks as the fees are cheaper than most brokerages though they do have a 0.12% per annum custody fee with no minimum. You can use them for local stocks also but DBS Vickers Cash Upfront is better as the stocks bought through DBSV Cash Upfront directly goes to your CDP.0 comments0"

3,"Question Poster3w agoMay I know why DBS vickers for local stocks? Does this mean SAXO is not the right choice of buying local stocks?MIModel Investor3w agoHi anon, you can use SAXO to buy local stocks as well however the difference is that SAXO is a custodian account, when you buy the stock they hold it for you, whereas for DBS vickers which you open using CDP account you are the owner of the shares you buy. There is not much difference between a CDP account or a custodian account tbh, the main difference comes in the price, which is the lower fees in which custodians account such as SAXO charges you."
