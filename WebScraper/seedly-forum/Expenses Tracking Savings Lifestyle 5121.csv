1,"Leong Wen Fong, Economics and Management at University of LondonLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019One way is to go through friends who are in universities. I don't know about Polytechnics, but for one, SIM has a popular bookstore taht sells Apple Macbooks for a discounted rate (that's how I bought mine). However, they are limited to one per student only, so you have to find someone who hasn't already bought one.Alternatively, you can shift away from Mac and buy other brands, I believe that there are many more brands more worth it than Apple these days.From what I do know, Apple usually does not give a discount during IT fairs, but they give more free gifts then. So something for you to consider as well!1 comment1"

4,"Leong Wen Fong22 Oct 2018Not sure how reliable this is though! Had a friend working in Apple, and I think she said the discount isn't that much for Macbook! More for accessories though!Question Poster08 Nov 2018Thank you! I tried that route in the end! Apparently, friends working in Apple get taxed for it so its slightly less than 15%. By far, the better deal nonetheless!"
