1,"Asheesh Chanda, Founder at Kristal.AILevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 9h agoI think Nikko AM STI ETF is one of the best ways to get invested into the Singapore equity market. Given its expense ratio of ~0.28% it should not be considered expensive. Only thing you should check if when you buy for 200$ each time (say monthly) how much brokerage do you land up paying. So if you are charged 5$ to buy 200$ of an ETF then it would be considered very expensive.W.r.t ABM I would suggest evaluate a balanced Kristal like All Weather / All Rounder / Steady Growth based on your risk profile or just take any balanced portfolio of US Equities (SPY), EM Equities (VWO/EEM) and Gold (GLD) clubbed with Bond ETFs (try UCITS preferably LQDA or a BND, LQD)Also do run the algorithm at Kristal.AI (investments upto $50,000 are free) and see what that shows for your profile. Happy to help out if you need more info.0 comments4"

3,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 03 Nov 2018By buying into etfs of your choice, you are actively taking a market view. By investing into stashaway (or other robo), you are allowing someone else to take a market view. You didnt mention which exact etf u are buying into and using which platform to do that. So you have to consider what is the risk exposure u are willingly to accept or want to go into. Also u have to consider the costs, what are your total cost involved for both methods (as %of investment amount). 0 comments0"

If you're planning to DCA with Stashaway in local ETFs, then you should compare the management fees between those Nikko and Stashaway. 0 comments0"
