question,"Savings Retirement Asked by Jonathan TeohAsked on 12 Dec 2018Where do asset-rich-cash-poor seniors living in private property go to for financial help when they are broke?Low-income retiree households have a number of avenues to seek financial help provided their household income threshold is below $3500. However there are retiree households that are above this threshold and need financial help.  Assuming they're not able to work, can't monetise their home and don't have dependents who can financially help, where else can these seniors go for financial help when they're broke?1 answerAnswerBump1"

1,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019There are still ways to monetise their home.You should say its the unwillingness to monetise their home (through rental).A counsellor will likely go through many questions even before you say they can't monetise. Private property is different from public, hence the help you can receive will likely only be advice. 2 comments0"

I would like to connect with such person to obtain additional perspectives for a potential solution which I'm working on. Loh Tat Tian13 Dec 2018https://www.ccs.org.sg/need-help 

this is what comes up to me off the head. For other financial counselling services, it depends on the type of financial difficulties they are in. For health care, they can approach HealthHub
