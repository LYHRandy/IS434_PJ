GeniusUpdated on 24 Apr 2019Will You Be Getting NCD 40% Next Year?Yes.As long as you don't make any claims under your insurance plan, you will attain NCD (No Claim Discount) 40% in the 4th year that you hold your car insurance.About NCDFor those who aren't drivers, the NCD is a discount that reduces your car insurance premium for the following year. This is your insurerâ€™s way of recognising and rewarding you for being a careful driver.Your NCD will keep increasing till a maximum of 50% upon the 5th year of you not making a claim on your insurance. After your 5th year, you'll continue enjoying 50% NCD as long as you don't drive like you're in ""The Fast And Furious"" franchise.I'm crying in the car rn.Shopping For Car InsuranceAbout whether you should start shopping around for another car insurance now... think of it this way.Would you plan to buy toilet paper only when you need it? Or would you already start looking around NOW to see what's the best toilet paper available, or maybe even what's the best deal you can get in preparation for when you need toilet paper...Oh, and just in case you're wondering, your NCD is tagged to you. Not your car, or your insurer. So if you find a better deal or a plan with better benefits, and decide to switch insurers, your NCD moves along with you.However, this doesn't apply to NCD Protectors though. Those stay with whatever insurer you're with and cease to be in effect when you stop paying the premium, or switch insurers.If I were you, I would:Shop around and check out current promos/dealsTalk to my current insurer now and see if they will match it or throw in some other sweetenerIf not, I'll switch.Unless your current insurer has fantastic customer service, then I'd recommend you stick with them - because submitting a claim to a non-responsive insurer is something I would only wish upon my greatest enemy - until you find a better plan or insurer.If you'd like to read more about car insurance, Seedly has a pretty good article for reference: https://blog.seedly.sg/best-car-insurance-singapore/0 comments3"
