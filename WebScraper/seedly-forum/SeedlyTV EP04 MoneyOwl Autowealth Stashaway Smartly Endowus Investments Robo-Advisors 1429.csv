1,"Eddy CheongLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 23 May 2019Thank you, Low Rui Jia, for your question. I will answer it in the following way.(1) Who is recommended to invest?Basically anybody who needs to grow wealth should invest so that money works harder than leaving as bank deposits.But before investing, you should be financially healthy, just like you need to be physically healthy to run a marathon. A good financially health means having sufficient emergency fund, avoiding excessive debts and getting major protection risks covered, put you on a firm foundation that strengthen your ability to stay invested in the long term.(2) You should stay invested in the long termFor a successful investing experience, staying invested is necessary in order to capture long term market return. While there will always be short term fluctuations, stock markets go up in the long run because of higher corporate earnings driven by demand of goods and services due to growing global population and rising affluence.But staying invested during market volatility is difficult because of human nature. Even though our HEAD knows that (1) there will always be short term market fluctuation, (2) markets always recover and (3) markets go up in the long term, our HEART usually fails to follow through, resulting in missed investing opportunities.(3) A Trusted AdviserHence it is important to seek good advice and invest with those you can trust. Trust means trustworthy, competent, and one who is able to journey with you to help you stay on course through turbulent times in order to reap the benefits of investing.MoneyOwl believes in this philosophy of trust and competency.. Even though we have a few robos (insurance, will-writing, investment), we called ourselves as bionic adviser. By bionic, it means we combine the precision of technology with the wisdom of human advisers to give you the advice you need. On top of that, our conflict-free salaried advisers are there to risk coach and help you understand how markets work and encourage you to stay invested.It may interest you to know that MoneyOwl is a JV between 2 trusted brands - NTUC Enterprise and Providend. NTUC is a household name that has been around for decades, to serve ordinary working families and help everyone stretch the hard-earned dollar. Providend is the first fee-only, conflict-free independent financial adviser in Singapore since 2003, known for its best-in-class expertise and ethical advisory practice. We are thus confident to bring our services to the Singapore mass market, with this unique parentage that brings a combination of mission and expertise.0 comments2"

Like you said, it's quite lo-touch, which definitely makes it convenient for someone who doesn't like to always check up on it.0 comments1"
