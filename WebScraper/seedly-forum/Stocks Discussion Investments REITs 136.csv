1,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 28 Jun 2019There are currently only 2 healthcare REIT in SGX, First REIT and ParkwayLife REIT.Parkwaylife REIT will surely come out tops. It has a portfolio of extremely good private hospitals in Singapore and overseas. Gleneagles and mount E, very expensive private hospitals but still always packed! They also have nursing homes in Japan and Korea.First REIT main weakness is the indonesian currency. Its portfolio is concentrated in Indonesia and to receive dividends in SGD is taking a toll on the REIT. The indonesian rupiah has declined against the SGD by a huge margin and the rental agreement made 10 over years ago is actually putting a strain on them. The next rental renewal is coming up soon in a few years and that is the main risk factor. Will they renew to the latest exchange rate? If they do, then the DPU will drop.1 comment3"
