Now, we can look at growing your savings. You might want to first start off by opening a bank account with potentially higher interest rates and credit your salary into that bank account to earn the said higher interest rates. You can look into the DBS Multiplier Account or OCBC 360 Account.
Next, you can look at putting your savings into various instruments to make them work a little harder for you. Before you look into any instrument, make sure that you know what your risk appetite is and what products are more suitable for you.
For a start, you can look at bonds like Singapore Savings Bonds for low-risk investments. I'd definitely suggest that you speak to a seasoned Financial Consultant / Financial Advisor to help you work through this. Or speak to several and get a sense of what is most suitable for you.
As for the use of credit cards, you can look at cashback cards. Look out for credit card promos to ensure that you make the most out of a card. Of course, always pay your credit card dues in time so that you don't incur any additional charges! :)Hope this helps!0 comments0"
