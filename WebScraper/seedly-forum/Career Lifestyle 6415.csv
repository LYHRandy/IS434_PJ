1,"WnkLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 03 Jun 2019Hi Anonymous! It really depends on your life situation and career objective. Being a manager might require a steeper learning curve (and longer working hours), but if you wish to rise along the career ladder faster, I would say go for it! If you are considering setting up a family, you might reconsider the spending of such long hours at work as opposed to having more time to spend with your family. You do sound like you are still in the initial stage of your career building though. Never mind that you have no managerial experience, you just have to start somewhere. Do ample preparation for your interview when you get one! The process will be worth your while! Try both roles out! :p0 comments5"
2,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 05 Jun 2019I definitely would explore the one with more learning opportunities - and I say this regardless of your age. Especially if the compensation is the same, definitely choose the one that allows you to learn more, and also potentially expand into other areas.In this day and age, it definitely helps to be multi-faceted in terms of skill set.0 comments1"
3,"Bang HongLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 07 Jun 2019Explore both, since you are still at early stage of your career.With assuption Senior Exec role / manager role is someone with 3 years to 6 years of experience.I will say understand the job scope and sometimes dont be afraid to explore and ask.Recruiter if they are in-house with hiring manager, i might just propose why not I come as a trial for 1 day for each role, the hiring manager can better assess my suitability and I could also make an informed decision. I could go to the extent of signing NDA and other documents that will keep the information which I come across confidential. Be bold, try something new with assumption you have some idea where you are heading to. Don't be afraid to be out of the norm, be yourself and contribute!0 comments0"
4,"Jacq NgLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 05 Jun 2019I think it also depends on your disposition. Managerial role involves handling staff issues, while a senior exec role kinda allows you to specialize more in what you are doing. Would you be comfortable with the additional managerial responsibilities and to guide and develop people? or would you prefer to just focus on just 'doing' the work? If I were you, I would probably apply to both and find out more during the interview what exactly does each role entail. For example, for the managerial role, how big is the team and what is the reporting structure like? and for the senior exec role, what is the scope of the work (to see if there's any room for development and growth) vis-a-vis my current work?0 comments0"
