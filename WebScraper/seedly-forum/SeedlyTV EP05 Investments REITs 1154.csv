Although prices are at an all-time high, but I feel that it is justifiable because REITs are indeed doing actions to grow the company, in turn growing shareholders wealth. A very good example is Capitalmall Trust - With prices nearing 52 week high, Funan is slated to open some time this quarter which would present an additional income stream for the REIT itself, in turn increasing DPU and dividend yield. And with the recent completion of Jewel, there may be a possibility that it'll be included in it's portfolio in due time as well.
