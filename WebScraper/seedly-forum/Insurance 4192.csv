1,"Cherie Julianne TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Apr 2018Hey! This is a common question that most of us would face. There are two types of additional insurance coverage that you can look at (apart from ISP).
1. Term or Whole Life Plans (provides your family a payout for your untimely dismiss)Term is pretty straight forward, you get to choose how long you would like to be covered. However, there would be no cash value to this. Whole Life, as the name goes, provides you with the coverage for life (age 99) with cash value. When choosing the type of insurance coverage, do check if you really do need it. For example, are your parents dependant on you for income? Is anyone depending on you for your income? Personal Accident PlanIt reimburses you any medical fees incurred due to an accident. Few questions you should ask yourself before committing to one. Are you active? Do play sports often?Are you self-employed, and is moving around from one place to another required by your job? This does not apply to everyone, you should also check if your company provides you with coverage as you are allowed to only claim once per receipt.I hope this helps!0 comments3"

2) You fall sick, I payWould you like a pay out to your dependents (spouse, kids, elderly parents), if any of the 2 unfortunately happens to you?If yes, follow the rules of thumb. Coverage for:1) 10-15 years of your annual salary for Death and Total Permanent Disability 
2) 3-5 years of your annual salary for a income protection due to critical illness.After figuring out how much that is, you should then look at finding a trusted advisor that can help you find the relevant products that suit those needs.I would recommend you find an Independent Financial Advisor as they would be able to also compare across the various insurers to find you the best deals and explain the latest updates of the T&Cs, etc.Hope this has been helpful. Cheers. 0 comments1"

Here i the best way to look at it, I'm completely unbiased coming from a financial writer point of view, so you can understand that my article/comments has no sales pitch inside. It is referenced from this article: https://blog.seedly.sg/working-adults-what-are-the-key-insurance-policies-you-should-get-in-singapore/There are 2 types of pure essential insurance that anyone should get (if you can afford it)1) IP (integrated shield plan) which is an enhancement to the current MediShield government coverage (basically this plan is for when you get warded)As you probably know this is critical, gets you to a coverage level which is beyond a B2 ward in a public hospitalYou can and probably should cover up to A class ward or private level (as this opens up ways to choose your doctor, get faster service etc.) Some people choose to add on the Riders as well to pay less deductibles, or co-payment2) Term or Whole Life (basically this is a payout in terms of death)Term Life: This is a purely coverage focused product, where all your monthly/yearly premiums go into coverage, so at the end of 65 years old, you are no longer covered and there is no cash component to this. This is what most savvy people recommend because they know how to use the excess cash saved to invest for better returnsWhole Life: This is a mix of coverage product and savings component tied to it, where there is a cash value associated with your policyWhy do people recommend BTIR (buying term life and investing the rest)? It's because they are usually savvy and they find that instead of having some form of savings/cash value at the end of their life, they feel that they can get more returns than the usual 1-3% that the whole life plan will probably yield.Why do people not fear being not covered beyond age 65?It's because when you draw out your life cycle, the wealth accumulation phase is usually between 20 to 55 years oldBeyond 55 years old, usually you would be in the wealth preservation phase (like retirement) where you would live off your nest egg (CPF and dividends etc)Beyond 65 years old, if you have children, they will be able to take care of themselves most likely as they would be adults, hence all your debt (from housing, school loan etc) would have been paid fully, and you have no more 'financial burden' which will be passed on to themThat's the whole concept right there. :) hope it answers you as a whole!A whole life plan with Critical Illness rider:I think this sounds like a decent plan, I personally have something similar (but with the AVIVA MINDEF group insurance for all NS men)However, I would caution that you should consider not overly cover yourself via the whole life at the start, but instead use a hybrid of term in the earlier part of your life. Reasons as above.So it should look something like this:Whole life with CI rider = $100k till the endTerm life (death) = $400k till 65 *Note: Numbers are arbitrary but used to illustrate an example. The $ dollar values should be matching your amount of debt or liabilities projected.Fact: My own father just passed away from Brain Cancer (a critical illness) at age 54. So yes, all these illnesses are very real and it will most likely hit more people at a earlier age these days. (1 in 3 people get cancer today)0 comments0"
