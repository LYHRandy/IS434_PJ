MasterAnswered on 02 Mar 2019Do a calculation and honestly with inflation the surrender value etc. Is not going to be worth much in future. Most of all, evaluate your needs. If you're focusing on retirement, get a good retirement plan. If you're focusing on protection (disability) then get the right term insurance. It will be cheaper in the long term.0 comments0"
