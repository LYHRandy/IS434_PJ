question,"Savings Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 15 Nov 2018My dad doesn't trust any other places to put his money other than his savings account, which has very little returns.

1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Nov 2018Perhaps alternatives like Singapore savings bonds, ABF Singapore bond index fund through posb's invest saver programme, citibank's maxi gain or cimb's fastsaver may be something more suitable. If you can somehow convince your dad to invest in stocks whose products are used everyday by everyone that may be good as well. Blue chip counters on sgx like the local banks, dairy farm, telcos, or even sheng siong. These potentially give better returns than the others I mentioned above. 0 comments1"
2,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019There are quite a bit of alternatives available:
1) SSB
2) Fixed Deposits
3) Short Term Endowments
4) Mid to Perpetual Endowments
5) Switch Bank account to CIMB or Standard CharteredIn terms of persuasion, it's always about finding out his ""real"" objections about saving money through alternative means such as the above stated.Some of the possible objections:
1) Other instruments not safe
2) Bank is the only safe place to save money
3) Liquidity 
4) Bank's interest rate is enough for mePersuasion wise, there can be a couple of options:
1) Use an example that is close to his life. For example a cup of Kopi-O. Ask him how much a cup cost 10 years ago versus today. If he had placed the amount in a bank 10 years ago, would he be able to buy a cup today? Or has inflation outstripped the bank's interest.2) Show him a spreadsheet on the returns of $10,000 with varying returns (0.05%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 3%, 4%) over 10 - 15 years. I am assuming that your dad is risk adverse, so 4% would be quite a good yield fot capital guaranteed instruments.3) Combine the 2 scenarios above and calculate the inflation of his Kopi-O for the past 10 years. Show him the minimum returns he needs to get in order to beat inflation. The crux is to share with him that he is losing money every day by putting it into his bank. Ask him to think about retirement 10 years or even 20 years down the road, how much would he have? Is he okay for his money to continue to Diminish?Or you may get him to speak to a financial planner like myself!2 comments1"
3,"Question Poster19 Nov 2018Hmm,  will try number 1! I think he'll get impatient with me if I show him spreadsheets! but good analogy though! thanks!Brandan Chen19 Nov 2018Yeah, spreadsheets dont really appeal to the older generation. You need him to figure out that he is not really making any money by leaving it in the bank. 

Let me know how that works out for you! Feel free to drop me an email at Brandan.chen@manulife.com.sg or PM me at www.facebook.com/brandan.chen if you need more options"

7,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Nov 2018A more passive approach would be to try time deposit which has higher rates than savings account, or you could do the math and relate it to being able to afford things he want/more of things he commonly use.0 comments0"
