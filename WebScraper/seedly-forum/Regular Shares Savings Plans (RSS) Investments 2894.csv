God of WisdomAnswered on 15 Jan 2019We can't predict when a bear market is coming but if you're worried I'll go for more defensive industries and short term bonds. I wouldn't wait to invest, but I may put my money to better use, so SSB or paying off a loan for the time being. Both giving guaranteed return.0 comments2"
