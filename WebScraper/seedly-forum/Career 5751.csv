question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 24 Apr 2019I work in the supply chain andâ€‹ my work typically involves processing figures and coordination. I feel a lack of motivation for my job. Any advice on how best to work through this? Currently I am also trying to read up more regarding my role and the industry, however,  I still feel like something is missing. In addition, I recently discovered a flair for writing, not because I was particularly talented in it, but because I had spent a good number of years in my life writing (secondary , JC, uni). In addition, I realized that I process thoughts/ ideas better through writing.1 answerAnswerBump0"

In all honesty, writing is not the most sustainable of jobs, especially if you are doing freelance writing. Writing thoughts and opinions is also very different from what most companies demand right now, which is content marketing.For the lack of motivation, try and form short career goals that will keep you moving. In the same way that very few students like to study, they still do, because they know it is necessary. However, short goals can give you a short burst to reach a certain target. If after several short goals, you still feel demoralised and demotivated, then perhaps you really are in the wrong industry after all.That being said, not everyone can work as something their passionate in. Find a good reason to work, be it supporting your family, or wanting to travel the world in the future. It could even be to reach financial independence, or to live comfortably. You may never fully enjoy work, but your work will allow you to enjoy the small things in life, and the things that truly matter.All the best!0 comments2"
