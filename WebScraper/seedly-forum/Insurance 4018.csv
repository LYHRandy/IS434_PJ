1,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Nov 2018I would say it depend on your cash flow. Some like to pay monthly for cashflow and easier expenses tracking, while losing the discount in the process.As Yixiong Mentioned, the discount can vary from 1% to 3% so it also depends on the policy paid. You shouldn't spend too much time though to decide. Also, someone else has posted a similar topic.https://seedly.sg/questions/should-i-pay-insurance-premium-yearly-or-monthly0 comments1"
