Not sure what kind of answer you're looking for. However, here are some financial rule of thumbs for you to follow:1) have 6 months of your salary set aside for emergencies.2) the % of bonds you should have in your portfolio should be aligned with your age rounded up to the nearest 0 or 5. eg. a 25 year old investing for retirement should have a 75% equity, 25% bond portfolio.3) diversify across asset classes, geographies, and industries. don't put all your eggs in one basket.4) instead of trying to time the market, invest regularly. one method is to use dollar cost averaging.5)  track your investing costs. paying for a professional is fine, but don't over pay. 6) always note that past performance is not an indicator of future performance. fundamentals matter more. 7) rebalance your portfolio regularly. every quarter or bi annually should be fine. 8) don't be so eager to realize your losses when your portfolio goes south. wait it out and continue investing if the fundamentals don't change. markets are volatile, expect it.9) investing and trying to achieve upside performance is great, but make sure your downside is covered as well. be well insured.10) no one is perfect. we all have biases. speak to a trusted financial advisor to check your blind spots. you may be repeating potentially harmful mistakes without your knowledge, and it doesn't hurt to ask for help or advice.I can't think of much more for now. Hope this helped.0 comments1"

This means your insurance coverages for life, critical illness, accident and hospitalisation etc. The ability to ""transfer"" the risk on your potential disablement/death/illness/hospitalization to another is, in my opinion, undervalued or misunderstood by many of us whose current assets such as cash or investment are unable to fulfil all our liabilities in our lives, such as potential mortgages, student loans, family expenses and education etc. There are many cases whereby a family's savings are evaporated by a breadwinner's death or worse, permanent disability, due to insufficient protection planning.next, your investments and savings. as long as you are able to meet your investment objectives within your risk profile, i think any method you do is wise, although not the most efficient/best. if you can fully pay for your child's education by the time he graduates, while investing conservatively in singapore saving bonds + government bills, or a mix of sti blue chip equities and reits, or any combination of asset classes is good enough as long as you can tolerate the risk that you are exposed to. equities of course, are riskier than investment grade fixed income instruments, but provide generally better returns. it honestly depends. personally, i think for a younger guy like myself, you can afford to (after taking care of protection) place more into riskier equities and lesser into safer securities (e.g investment grade bonds). e.g if you're 20 y/o - 20 % in bonds , 80% in equities eg. for capital growth.either way - protection first, then investments. but most importantly, start early!0 comments0"
