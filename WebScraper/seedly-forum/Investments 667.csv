MasterAnswered on 18 Aug 2019The following does not constitute advice nor is a recommendation.I sell this fund, so I'll tell you several things about it.1) The dividend yield is extremely high2) The Bond Fund has a decently high credit rating. 3) The Bond Fund is superior to its benchmark in its history net of fees4) The Bond Fund is available in many variations for Forex as well as dividend payout format5) The Fund Manager takes deliberate action not to pay out of the NAVSimilarly1) The Bond Fund dividend yield has fluctuated quite a bit, from as low as 5%+ to as high as 9%+. This can result in both volatility and short term unsustainability.2) The Bond Fund prices recently took a hit.
It's a good fund if you're looking for high dividend yields in the manner of someone retiring. It may be okay if you are looking for capital preservation (I did not say 'good). It certainly provides significant passive income for the risk you're taking, which is not tremendous historically.I typically complement it with other funds to help my clients retire.

Do nudge me back if you're interested in this fund, and maybe I can help you.https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
