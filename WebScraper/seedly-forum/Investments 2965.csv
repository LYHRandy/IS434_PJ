1,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Dec 2018Payout is at the end of 2nd business day, the following Month.So if u apply to redeem now (Nov), the payout will be on the 2nd Jan 2019 which is Wednesday.It might take another day before u see the actual crediting $ in your bank account.Incase u want to ask, there is no difference to apply early or late (within the month), the interest accrued (up to before the day of payout) will be paid to u. Application to redeem closes the 4th last business day of the month. So just apply anytime before that.0 comments0"
