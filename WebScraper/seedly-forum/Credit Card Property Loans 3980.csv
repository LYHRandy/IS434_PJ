These services will charge a fee on top of the amount you pay thus you are actually buying miles or points using those $$$ that you pay.0 comments0"
2,"Sean SimLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 13 Sep 2019Hi, you could theoretically get points for paying your home mortgage by using third party payment apps like plastiq. Where you would pay plastiq using your credit card and they would pay your recipient afterwards via wire or bank transfer. Take note that they charge a flat transaction fee of 2.5% so if your credit card rewards and cashback is higher than 2.5% I would recommend you take a look at plastiq.0 comments0"
