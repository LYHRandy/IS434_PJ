question,"Career Insurance Investments Savings Family General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 18 Sep 2018How should women plan their finances different from their men counterparts?Not being a sexist, but I always wonder from insurance, career, investments to spending and everything in between, being females who take on a different path from graduation to marriage and subsequently motherhood, is there a difference in planning for their finances? I'm thinking of this now, as I am looking to share with my other half on how to think about her money and help her grow it also, either together or separately!2 answersAnswerBump0"

This is due to:Insurance premium will be differences due to coverage and woman live longer and less risky. But woman has more illness to worry about due to being the more complex body and functioning as the one who give birth to human race. Career - Some will give up and sacrifies for family, child rearing. Some were more career  minded like a guy. So that affects the income.Investment - This part i think everyone is different regardless of sexes. It's more towards ages and personal risk appetite and financial situations. Spending - Woman naturally spend more for some and some spend lessor. Basic will be make up, skin care, clothings, facial/hairdo that will be much more than a guy. Some just do basic or nothing at all so will be the same as a guy. Heck, even guys these days spend on skin care, clothings, facial/hairdo! haha. ​In terms of financial planning, I would recommend introduce and read together with her on SG budgetbase blog: http://sgbudgetbabe.com/family-posts as she comes from similar background and family and faces most common problem a woman faces in Singapore.  Both of you can discuss and study and even ask her questions to gain more knowledge and understanding on how to plan a woman, married woman and mother's financial that is also sandwich class like most of us in singapore that needs to take care of parents, ownself and next generations. ​To have a broader perspective, investment from the male side and also learning more about investment, financial planning, read more in seedly facebook and this website with blog post, product reviews and also you may ask any questions. This will helps you guys to explore more options and tools for investment, financial planning and more! :) ​Happy life and financial planning! :) ​0 comments0"
