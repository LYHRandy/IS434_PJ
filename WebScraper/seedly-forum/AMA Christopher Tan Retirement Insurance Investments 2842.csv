question,"AMA Christopher Tan Retirement Insurance Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 24 Jan 2019Should I stop subscribing to Share Builder Plan and invest on my own?I am a 29-year-old lady. Not a invest savvy on my own and have a full-time job. So I depend a lot on POEMS Share Builder Plan started since 2015 till now, back then I invested $600 monthly (3 counters) and slowly increase the amount to $1000 monthly (6 counters). The reason why I choose SPB is because it can reinvest my dividend. However, they do charge 1% on my dividend for reinvest. I am thinking whether I should stop subscribing SPB and invest on my own. What should I do?2 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Christopher Tan, Executive Director at MoneyOwl Private limitedLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Jan 2019Dear anonymous, thanks for sharing about your investments and also for your question. Sorry for the late reply. Firstly, allow me to say that if you are not investment savvy, you should avoid owning individual stocks. In fact, even if you are investment savvy, holding on to just a few stocks might not be a good idea because you are taking on too much risks by concentrating your portfolio on just a few stocks. Personally, I do not own any individual stocks because I have no time to study and follow them and I also want to divesify my money across more stocks. I would suggest that you either invest in a portfolio of low cost ETFs (that tracks the index) or low cost funds such as Dimensional Funds. Low cost = less than 0.5% p.a. in terms of management fee. As a start, here are a list of equities ETF you can consider:SPDR S&P500 ETF - US, a proxy to develop marketsSPDR Straits Times Index ETF - Singapore marketDb x-trackers MSCI Pacific Ex Japan UCITS ETF - A proxy to AsiaBy investing in then, you will be broadly diversified across different geographical regions. There are enough studies to show that it is very difficult to beat the market by trading and there is really no need to. The driver of returns for stocks is earnings or profitability. As long as world population continues to grow (and it is!) and people have needs and companies continue to exist to meet the needs, stock prices will (and have) gone up over the long run. Yes, some companies will fail but most will continue to be around. That is why you should invest in a broad diversified portfolio.So stay invested. Do not get in and out based on views or news. That will be gambling.Ok, hope this helps.0 comments2"

WonderkidAnswered on 25 Jan 2019Well, First of all, I must say you are dealing your money very smartly considering you are just 29 and have a full-time job. Coming to the main point,If you are doing trading even if with the help of ShareBuilder, I guess you are doing your own research little bit about stock trading.  If I am getting your right then in coming future you might increase your amount from $1000 that means your investment will increase that means your dividend payment will increase and that will lead to more fee of reinvestment of dividend. See, there are many people who are do trading with 9 to 5 job. I am telling you a few of the lesson that learned from my experience.Find a trading style that can suit you. You can try swing trading in which you will just have to watch weekly price change and you can do trading on your weekends. Money is waiting, I mean it literally. There are investors who do about 80% of their trading on weekends. Plan your trading strategy and make the trade on weekends.Do not change your trading style over and over again very frequently. Because you won't be able to understand your trade. Figure out what actually you want from trading then plan ahead. I hope I helped, Let me know your response.0 comments0"
