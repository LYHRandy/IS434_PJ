1,"Ray DingLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 28 Jun 2018Citi Cash Back Card would be the best. 8% cash back at food & beverage outlets, supermarkets, food & groceries delivery (including Deliveroo, honestbee, RedMart) and Grab rides globally. Up to 20.88% at Esso and Shell, and 8% Cash Back at other petrol stations. 0 comments1"
