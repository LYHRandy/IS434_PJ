1,"Leo KwekLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 28 Aug 2019Hi you can only apply for a new BTO after the 5 years MOP of your Resale Flat.Once you have completed the 5 years MOP, you can then proceed to apply for BTO Balloting.If you manage to successfully ballot for a new BTO, upon receiving keys to it, you will have 6 months to sell away your Resale Flat.All of the above is assuming that the Resale Flat is your first subsidized housing.4 comments2"
2,"See all 4 comments Question Poster28 Aug 2019Actually, my current resale flat is ?not considered subsidised housing as I did not obtain any grants from the govt, but I guess the MOP of 5 years still stands according to the web link - https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/new/hdb-flat?anchor=PublicSchemeLeo Kwek28 Aug 2019Regardless whether you did or did not receive any housing grants, the 5 years MOP still stands as long as you purchase an HDB BTO or Resale Flat. But since you did not get any grant for your current Resale Flat, when you sell it and apply for a BTO next time, you are considered a First-Timer and do not have to pay any resale levy."
