1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019There are plenty of advisors here who answer questions from people who aren't even their clients.But jokes aside, give them a call, and probably send them an email as well other than just a text. With this black and white, you can ask the insurer to arrange another advisor for you or you can find another advisor and deny your initial advisor with any recurring commissions if any.2 comments4"
2,"Question Poster09 Apr 2019But if I change wouldn't the new agent get no commission? So why would she/he serve me as I didn't buy policy from them..Hariz Arthur Maloy09 Apr 2019If it's a new product, there might be some. But honestly, it shouldn't matter so much. People's lives are always changing. You may have new needs in the future and if the new advisor can make sure you're happy with their service, they may have new business in the future. But if it's just simple questions, it really doesn't take much time to answer. So many of us do it all the time on this platform."

Your agent may be busy etc.However, if you really suspect the non-answer is that bad (more than 1 week, even after a few follow up), you may wish to find a new financial advisor to ask questions. Or put up your questions here and the community will try their best to answer.2 comments1"
4,"Question Poster09 Apr 2019Before I signed she been very keen on follow-up and whenever I got questions she will respond yet now.. guess once money is in their pocket they will ignore us..Alan Kor09 Apr 2019Yes you are correct, once comms are in their pockets, they will drop the act"
