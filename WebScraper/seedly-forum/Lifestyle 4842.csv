1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 12 May 2019For the items that I have bought there - it does offer prices on the lower side! Things I have bought are:bicycleboxing wraps sports gearsports towelbicycle lights That said, sometimes you could have places that are closing down, and are offering really good prices on better quality stuff. In that case, I would go for that option.0 comments1"

Espcially the shoes.But you can try Queensway shopping center also, before it closes down. I recently bought tennis and futsal shoes there. Or IMM via the Outlet shops (Adidas, and Nike)0 comments0"
