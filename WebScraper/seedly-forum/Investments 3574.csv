1,Alan SeowLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 11 Jun 2018You might want to buy ETFs or China stocks listed locally. Another way is to buy HK stocks. China stocks are not tradable due to restrictions in stock exchange and currency. 0 comments0
2,"Goh Kah KiatLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 09 Jun 2018It is almost impossible for foreigners to buy the “mother” shares of chinese companies listed on the Shanghai or Shenzhen indexes. That said, you can buy most of the companies that matter on the HKSE or US exchanges.​Not really a tax expert but I imagine you will be subject to the prevailing taxes depending on which exchange you buy. HK has no capital gains tax but 10% dividend withholding tax.0 comments0"

WonderkidAnswered on 08 Jun 2018If you are talking about china listed stocks A or B shares, those are almost impossible to get for retail investors.​You can either A - buy a china etf.​If you are refering to Chinese comapnies, e.g Tencent, alibaba, baidu, jd.com, etc - these are actually listed in US stock exchange most brokers with access to nasqad or NYSE can do it. 0 comments0"
