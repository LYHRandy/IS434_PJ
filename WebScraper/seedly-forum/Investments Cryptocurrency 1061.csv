1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019They only made a lot of money by entering early and exiting at the right time. So, while some people made some money, some people are down by quite a bit as well.Crypto right now is still speculation and not ""investment"" for now. It's a gamble. Only invest money you can literally throw away and not care about and I'll limit it to 3-5% of your portfolio. You may get lucky, we don't know. But make sure you don't become poor from trying.2 comments4"
2,Question Poster03 Jun 2019So those folks who got rich from such speculation were just lucky & do not posess “skills?”Hariz Arthur Maloy03 Jun 2019Yeah pretty much.
3,"Ron TanLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 09 Jun 2019It is better if u bought and HODL. Understand what is the usage and important of Bitcoin. It is a peer to peer currency. Crypto could become a regular currency, perhaps in the future. So if you have some now, and hang on to them. You could be richer than those now, since u could transact much more easily than others.1 comment2"

5,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 05 Jun 2019Only for those who got in super early, and managed to hold it until the last bull run. I agree with Hariz that those that got rich from that wouldn't have analyzed that to the detail that an equity investor does, but in a general sense believed in the potential of cryptocurrency even as far as a decade ago. Currently, crypto prices are still much more volatile than currencies and there definitely isn't a set rubric to analyse them.0 comments1"
6,"Raymond FongLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Not now or the future. They started investing in Bitcoins shortly after it was launched when it was a couple of dollars per Bitcoin. However, at that point in time, no one would have predicted Bitcoins would hit USD20k per Bitcoin. It has dropped to USD3k since and has climbed to USD8k recently. Whether it will climb back to USD20k is anyone's guess. But at USD8k, you would earn USD12k per Bitcoin, which means you need go buy around 84 Bitcoin to become a millionnaire it if hits USD20k again. The will cost you USD672k. Not really good ROI and high chance it won't hit USD20k per Bitcoin again.2 comments1"
7,"Question Poster03 Jun 2019I was not referring specifically to Bitcoin but rather cryptocurrencies as a whole. And that also involves trading them for 20/30% gains a day and compounding on it, as opposed to just holding them from bottom to high as in the Bitcoin example that you’ve providedRaymond Fong03 Jun 2019It's highly speculative if you intend to do that. Also highly unregulated which means some groups may be manipulating the prices and prices may not rise over many months due to their manipulation."

Its like the next big thing. But now it has went back to a normal cycle with demand/supply dynamics.However, i still believe there is money to be made in crypto. Its only whether you pick the correct cryptocurrencies and how long your investment period is for it to work out.0 comments0"
