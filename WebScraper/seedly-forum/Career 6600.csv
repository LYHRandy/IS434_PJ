1,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 18 Nov 2018Honestly its based on which you prefer. Stable career for me because i think financial consultant is not an easy job, you have to put in a lot effort to do well. You have an ongoing student loan and you already threw yourself into upcoming housing loan and planning for wedding but you have less than 1k of savings. You need a bigger emergency fund of around 6 months expenses. You put 10k in investment and insurance with ongoing student debt, upcoming house loan and wedding cost. Less than 1k is not enough when emergency actually happen. If you are not careful and emergency happens or you cant sell as a financial consultant, you will be in a very sticky situation.0 comments1"
