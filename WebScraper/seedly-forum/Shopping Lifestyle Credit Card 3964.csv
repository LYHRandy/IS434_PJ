1,"LWLee Wen Wei, Cfa, FrmLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 24 Sep 2019It depends on what you are looking for. Cashback or Miles. For cashback, you can consider Maybank FC Barcelona Visa card, it has cashback of 1.6% with no min. and max. spending. For Miles, you can go for UOB PRIV miles card. It gives 1.4miles per dollar spend, and also 6 miles if you book through 3rd party apps like Expedia and Agoda. As for your second qs, definitely use 3rd party apps IMO. Don't forget to sign up for a Shopback account to earn even more cashback while you book your tickets/hotel. Hope this helps!0 comments1"
