1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 07 Apr 2019I find that exercising is a good way to start. A recent news article also puts forward the following: Itâ€™s no secret that exercising comes with a lot of health benefits, but apparently, it also makes people happier than having more money does. https://www.askmen.com/news/sports/exercise-is-more-important-to-happiness-than-money-says-science.html Candidly, cash savings of $100k will not technically make you happy. I achieved that target 5 years ago, and found that while that cash pile grew, I really was not necessarily 'happier'. I find joy in taking the time out to have a meal with loved ones, walks around marina barrage with my dad, dancing, so on and so forth. Know that everyone's time is limited, and I really doubt many people actually think back on their lives in terms of how much money they have amassed. Money might be a lubricant, but ultimately everyone defines success in different ways. If you are not happy and initially thought that money would be a way to make you feel better, and it hasn't, then it might be time to rethink your definition of success, and discover what makes you truly feel fulfilled.0 comments3"

Finding fulfilment is hard and money doesn't buy everything. Why don't you try and find more ways to meet people. Go for social events, pick up a new skill, reconnect with old friends. If you don't fancy social situations, try travelling. Maybe even donate your time to charity. Helping put a smile on someone else's face, might put one on yours.Just know that we can't go through life alone. We aren't built that way. Be interested in the things and people around you.0 comments0"
