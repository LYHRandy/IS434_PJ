1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 19 Jul 2019I find that my peers who usually mention wanting a 'work-life' balance usually don't enjoy their jobs very much.
Think about it: If you love your job, or are building a business that you are excited about - which category do you put it as, work or life?Forbes also featured an interesting piece on this:  https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamvanderbloemen/2017/04/17/there-is-no-such-thing-as-work-life-balance/#58cca56e39c86 comments6"

3,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 18 Jul 2019I don't think is over-rated.  In fact , according to survey, one of the highest staff welfare employee desire is not salary or annual leave or awesome facilities like google, but true flexi work scheme for work life balance.
In NZ, my customer company, the CEO starts at 8 or 8.30am and ends at 4.30pm to go home earlier for their family and hobbies and life. The have dinner earlier and sleep at 8.30pm.
Back to SG, i think it's more of too much emphasis is face time in the office. If more SME and MNC adapt a more pro family, adapt new generations of expectations of work lifestyle.I always believe in balance, single need life , need balance for own personal hobbies, exercise for healthier body and mind.  Parents need to fetch children from school , go home to cook or spend more time helping children with school work, for own hobbies and personal development.
Therein work takes up too much of our life and time. When downturns hits, when recession comes, when company let go of staff, who's the one still with us, stay with us and backing us ? It's our family and love one.
So if there's no balance, no allocation of more focus on family, who will be there for us ? What will be there for us when we're not working anymore ? when we're old  ?
So there, I fully support work life balance. Rather for everything in life, there need a balance.  If we're made for extreme, we won't need so many stages of life, we don't need much of life, we just live for one thing and one purposes, the extreme.0 comments4"

It's all about one's life priorities including but not limited to:WorkFamilyFriendsHealthFinance""Dig your well before you're thirsty.Early retirement is the dream.""0 comments2"
6,"Rachel ChiaLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 24 Jul 2019Personally, I donâ€™t think so. In fact more work-life balance makes jobs better. People arenâ€™t robots and canâ€™t be on their top performance all the time without proper rest.Itâ€™s true that there are cases where individuals are willing to sacrifice work-life balance: difficult financial circumstances, or to speed up their career. But if itâ€™s the company itself that decries work-life balance, it could honestly care more about its profits than its people.#1.Singaporeâ€™s work life balance is actually terrible.First off, working in Singapore today is probably worse than it was previously. Hours might have been long back then (and now), but thanks to the Internet, people are expected to be available for far longer. Itâ€™s gotten so bad that women here are giving birth later and later because they don't have time to raise kids.#2.Itâ€™s not overrated, because it makes staying in a job sustainable.Work-life balance is incredibly underrated, because a job with it way is more sustainable than one without. People are likely to stay much longer in a place where they don't burn out so quickly.Plus, staff who are well recharged are often more way more productive at work - which is one of the key reasons why some countries are proposing a 4-day work week.#3. You could think of it as work-life integrationIncreasingly, top companies are admitting that it's not possible to have 50% of time set aside for leisure and 50% for work. Instead, theyâ€™re suggesting work-life integration - an alternative where people fit more working hours into their schedules by slotting them in around their own life rythms.For example, flexible hours and remote working mean you could leave work at 6pm but then continue working later at night, or work from home in the morning to spend time with family, before coming in later in the day.1 comment1"

8,"Wei ShengLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 18 Jul 2019Each member may have a different opinion on what is constituted as work life balance.For me, my definition of work life balance would be the ability to do my best work in an industry or sector that I can continually learn and grow in, whilst also having the time and luxury to develop my skills and expertise in activities that would be of benefit to me in the long term.As such, it's vital that you decide what you want from a work life balance rather than let anyone else define it for you.1 comment1"

10,"Victoria ErLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 27 Jul 2019Work-life balance is important. We have gotten used to this lifestyle of continuously working and making our jobs a priority so much so that it has become the dominant narrative of what it means to be a good worker, and even a core part of our identity. 
I thought the same way until I met people from Norway and Denmark! They shared with me how their country values balance - there must be time for family and self-development. Denmark believes so strongly in this that they are now moving towards a 4 day work week. They are happy and balanced people because they have gotten their priorities right. In fact, they were named the most productive country in the world! 
In Singapore, we have many hardworking people. We pour in a lot of our time and heart into our jobs. But many are not happy and I don't think it is so much that we hate our jobs, but there is an imbalance. We have no time to enjoy with our families, to pursue hobbies and interests outside of our jobs. 
We need to move towards a society that takes care of people first - advocate for balance and time for family, and stop the obsessive focus on productivity and the economy. These will come when you have happy and healthy workers.0 comments0"
11,"Charmaine Ng, The Value Maximizer at @ Every Ma La Xiang Guo StallLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 23 Jul 2019I don't think work life balance is overrated. It's our culture that is undermining the needs of a work-life balance. I'm using needs vs other terms because I think for some of us; the pole has tilted in such a way that if you don't brake and get off the pedal you won't even realize it's unhealthy.I've had friends who worked everyday; not because they enjoy it but because they had to. They drag themselves to work everyday and lament about corporate life.. the proceed to work 8-8pm; essentially a 12hr shift with no OT.. in hopes to complete the assignment to no avail.Sometimes, they burn their weekends for work too. Is that healthy?The article mentioned rhythm of the company. Yes, I agree with that. Ideally one do not sacrifice the business for breaks but what if the business is perpetually growing and there's simply no breaks? Continuously subjecting your employees to no breaks in a stressful environment = burnout. What would you expect from a productivity point of view?For myself, as an employee I try not to take breaks when it's the peak period but if I could manage my work life to be in sync with my personal with sufficient rest in between it's the best. And by that it simply means I come to work the intended hours; do my best and finish the assignment. Sure, sometimes you'd have to work harder to chiong the datelines but not ALL the time.Every job has a downtime. A time when the system is down, when the pace slows a little for you to pick up where you left off. If today you find that you can't breathe at your job, ask yourself this. Is it your workload, is it your way of working or is it simply your leader at work.. who keeps on piling up unnecessary work to ""keep you busy""?For me, if it's something that can be resolved by changing the way of working or talking it out (re-allocation of workload) then it's fine. If not, the work life balance simply cannot be corrected and it's time to move out.0 comments0"
12,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 18 Jul 2019I believe in Work-Life harmony. And the thought of Work-life changes as we age also.
Recently I was at a industry gathering for the Steel industry due to my father in law who invited me over for a dinner.What I found that there was a ton of old age men (in their 60s and 70s) going very strong and they were all business leaders in their industries. They were all smiling, happy and engaged.They were still very sharp and leading huge businessesI could tell that they cannot live without workBecause the opposite would set their lives into mental decline (and likely dementia)So the idea of Work-life harmony (which is a now popularised term) exists:Keep your mind activeStay sharp while you enjoy workDon't retire too early0 comments0"
