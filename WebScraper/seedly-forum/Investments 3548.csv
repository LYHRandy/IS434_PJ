WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I personally read Rich Dad, Poor Dad back when I was in the Army :) And realised that there were two ways to build wealth.Learn to invest (and make money work for you)Start a businessIn my army days, I did 1) for awhile and asked my brother to buy local stocks for me but got burnt. Hence I went to learn to start a business, soon after, the startup wave started catching fire and thereafter, I went on that path instead :)​Other people would recommend these familiar books:A Random Walk Down Wall StreetOne Up On Wall StreetThe Intelligent InvestorBerkshire Hathaway Letters to ShareholdersThe Little Books Of Common Sense Investing​For me, after the advent of the internet and the mobile wave, I would recommend the following:Listening to podcasts instead about business and how the economy works Reading content on personal finance websites or bloggers to figure out how they started growingThis is espeically important because it usually would be more localised :)1 comment1"

ProdigyAnswered on 05 May 2019Hey there, Good question, and looks like you are trying to understand account/finance with the sole objective of learning to invest. Since you're looking to dive into the accounting books, you're porbably interested in value investing.
There are plenty of resources available, but i wrote a short post covering a sliver of this: (https://seedly.sg/questions/any-tips-or-resources-on-how-to-break-down-financial-statements-i-want-to-read-them-but-there-is-so-much-info-available). It's actually not that difficult once you dive into it.  As with everything, break it down into bite-sized chunks, understand bit by bit, and before you know it you're breezing through 10-Ks in under an hour each.0 comments0"
