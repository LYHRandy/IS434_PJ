1,"Leong Wen Fong, Economics and Management at University of LondonLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Oct 2018Hmm, I'm actually curious as to what you would define a ""result"" of your career?​If the result is to be, let's say, working in Facebook. After you achieve that, you'd naturally want to go even higher - say have a higher position within the company. Thus it's a little tough to define an ""end result"", but every goal will end up becoming the journey as well.​I'm sure this will be the same in many of our financial goals - Eg. getting a house/paying off a house, will eventually turn from being a ""result"" to part of life's journey.​So it's a little hard to differentiate between the 2, so I wonder what drove this question?0 comments1"
2,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Oct 2018I feel that both are important but the end result matters more as you can start from a small role (fresh graduate from Poly/Uni/ITE) and rise up/climb the corporate ladder. A good example are founders/co-founders of start-ups. Starting off from a small idea to executing it successfully, e.g. Grab, NinjaVan & Carousell. I'm sure that along the way, they had an awesome experience as they learnt many new things too. 0 comments0"
3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Oct 2018I'd say it depends on your personality. Some feel the end result may be the most important and will just take the most efficient route to reach it. Others will focus on the journey experience itself. 0 comments0"
4,"Png Cheng Xi Damien, Happy Life Seeker at HomeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 12 Oct 2018Both are equally important, if not, results are slightly more important. Think of it as delivering goods. The way you drive is important, but more importantly, you need to deliver the product! You can't be telling yourself ""I took a nice route, I enjoyed the ride"" but you don't deliver at all. Then it becomes pointless. But of course, you shouldn't be running people and animals over just to deliver the product.0 comments0"
