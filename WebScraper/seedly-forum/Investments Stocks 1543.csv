Starting out with only investing in one company is perfectly alright since we will all need to start from somewhere. However, once you are able to gain more capital and can invest in a larger amount, it is important to start diversifying and not only stick to one stock from the same company.However, if you want to be able to diversify from the start, some alternative to stocks would be ETFs and roboadvisors. Roboadvisors essential invest in ETFs as well.  This is because when you are investing in ETFs, there will tend to be a large number of stocks and other investments within the fund. Thus, this will make it more diversified than a single stock.  Roboadvisors will help you to invest in a range of stocks just like the ETFs, thus engaging a roboadvisor would also help to diversify your portfolio.Hope this helps!0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 22 Apr 2019If you're picking individual stocks, it's almost impossible to diversify well enough with such limited capital.But diversification is important. So look to buy funds that hold multiple securities instead.0 comments0"

You can use the subsequent 3k to find another stock to diversify.Diverisfying with small capital will only incur more commissions and any capital gains or dividends will be very insignificant.0 comments0"
