1,"Tracy LimLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 23 May 2019TL;DR: As Singapore is increasingly going green, should we take a look at Enviro-Hub which does recycling and refining of materials?Business overviewEnviro-Hub Holdings Ltd (“Enviro-Hub”) is a Singapore-listed organisation with a diverse portfolio that includes trading, recycling and refining of e-waste/metals, piling contracts, construction, rental and servicing of machinery, property investments and management, as well as plastics to fuel refining.Share priceCredits: Yahoo FinanceCurrently, Enviro-Hub Limited is trading at $0.0250. (as of writing on 16 May 2019), with the 52week L/H at $0.0200/$0.0680.The company does not have a dividend policy based on payout ratio and did not pay out dividends in FY2018.FinancialsGenerally I looked at FY2018, and whether there is an improvement from FY2017 to see whether it is good/bad. Revenue decreased in FY2018, but their profits actually had a turnaround. (Note: P/E ratio above is based on EPS as at 31 Dec 2018. Updated P/E ratio is 25x (Yahoo Finance). This is a small cap stock thus explaining the drastic change in P/E ratio)Their level of debt is too high and it is questionable their ability to repay debts timely.Revenue portfolioTheir core business is still recycling and construction, while exploring opportunities in property investment.OpportunitiesSingapore is going towards digitalisation, and this means the population will consume technology and innovation. Going green will mean e-waste management systems need to be in place to facilitate e-waste recycling. Enviro-Hub acquired, earlier this year had proposed to acquire a factory building in Jurong to facilitate the development of their recycling business. Comparing Singapore’s recycling efforts to many countries in Europe, we are still very much lacking. Recycling services can only be done if there are materials recycled, and there are much room for improvement here.RisksThere will be great challenges this year, given that there is trade war going on and all, which means their construction revenue stream will be affected. Also, since there is a negative profit in FY2017, which means that their profits can be pretty unstable.ConclusionThought it was pretty interesting to look at this stock for its business operations, although I wouldn't go into Enviro-hub personally. Overall, FY2018 saw a turnaround of their profits to a positive figure from FY2017. The nature of their business is recycling mainly, which is something that Singapore is working towards, especially with digitalisation and increased technology consumption.0 comments2"
