1,"Lin MLLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Great question about CPF as part of investment portfolio. Let's talk about the CPF Ordinary Account (OA). Note that the OA is a risk-free way to net up to 3.5% interest (2.5% plus additional 1% on combined OA, SA & MA balance up to $60,000).The CPF OA is a good way to earn a little interest, but why not make it work harder for you? I use my CPF OA to invest in relatively stable and ""safer"" stocks on the SIngapore Exchange. Here are a few criteria I look for in stocks when using my CPF OA:Dividend yield above 4% (My OA balance only gets excited to leave CPF if it can reap more than 3.5%)Low dividend payout ratio - this is to ensure that the company can continue to pay out and even raise dividends sustainably.Solid balance sheet Strong track recordI also deployed my OA funds like an ""opportunity fund"". This means that the OA monies were only triggered on rare occasions to invest in stocks on my watch list that were depressed or under-valued for whatever reasons.With this method, I invested in ST Engineering and OCBC Bank successfully and reaped returns higher than the promised 3.5%.2 comments2"
2,"AKAndrew Kwek16 Apr 2019Thanks for your answer Lin, it's great to make it work more than 3.5%. I think that it's really quite high and not quite worth the risk to try to make it above that, if I am thinking long term I would transfer the funds from oa to sa. However, I'm quite excited about the FIRE movement and I'm thinking of being FI when I'm 35. Which means my portfolio needs to last 30 years before I can get my hands on my cpf at 65.Lin ML19 Apr 2019Thanks for your reply Andrew. I'll love to be FI soon too! You're right that with 3.5% in OA or even 4% in SA, there is little reason to dabble with CPF. I had a different priority that caused me to make my OA work harder >.< I hope you find smth that works for you!"

4,"AKAndrew Kwek15 Apr 2019If you have 7k to spare would you top up your sa account or purchase a bond?Yong Kah Hwee15 Apr 2019I would put it in a short term bond because I forsee myself needing the money in the near future. If I do not need the money, and I cannot get a bond that gives more than 4%, I would go top up my SA."
