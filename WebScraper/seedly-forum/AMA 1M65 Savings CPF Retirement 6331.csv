1,"Loo Cheng Chuan, Founder at 1M65 MovementLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Nov 2018While it is a good plan, I think that CPF LIFE provides too little as the cost of living in Singapore is too high. One should just regard CPF LIFE as a baseline for a retirement target, and work towards 1M65 so that your retirement life can be worry-free. Even if you are unable to hit 1M65, hitting 500k at 65 years old will also help greatly.I feel that our Government has done their best given the constraints of the FRS that we can put into the retirement account . WE have to help ourselves and work towards a great wealthy retirement. 0 comments1"
