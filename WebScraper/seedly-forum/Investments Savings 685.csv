1,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 14 Aug 2019Bank brokerage or online brokerage are very similar. It is just a broker platform to place orders. Cheapest brokerage for SG stocks is $10 for those cash upfront accounts. And normal rates are about $25.You can just open all the accounts, see which one you like. Opening is free of charge.2 comments0"
2,"Question Poster14 Aug 2019Hey thanks! Yup I do have some accounts opened already. Could you elaborate on what cash upfront accounts are?Gabriel Tham14 Aug 2019Cash upfront accounts require you to deposit cash first before you are allowed to buy. And the amount you can buy is limited by the deposit. Normal accounts allow you to buy first, pay within T+2 days."
