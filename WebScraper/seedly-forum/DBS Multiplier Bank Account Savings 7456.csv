WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019They will create a new multiplier account for you.Salary need not go into the new multiplier account, as long as it has the correct transaction codeNo, You dont have to use multiplier to pay credit card, as long as u clock the spend is enough.Dividend, same like salary as long as credit to a posb/dbs account3 comments1"
