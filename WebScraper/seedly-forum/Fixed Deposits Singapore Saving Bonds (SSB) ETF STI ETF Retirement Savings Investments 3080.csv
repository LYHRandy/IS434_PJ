question,Fixed Deposits Singapore Saving Bonds (SSB) ETF STI ETF Retirement Savings Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 08 Nov 2018Newbie working mom trying to save and maximize yield returns?I'm 32yo wking mom and parking 70k untouched (which I understood is the cap) sitting in my ocbc 360 for rainy days/ liquidity purposes (>12mths of my income just in case). I considered myself a med risk taker and thinking to put my additional 25-30k to generate higher yields. These are my considerations and whether if etf/ssb/FD would be most viable? 1) Prepared to let this $ sit around for 10-15yrs if need be. 2) I may add funds to this instrument over time if it is still the best yield tool5 answersAnswerBump0

God of WisdomAnswered on 08 Nov 2018Hi Anon!If you're a medium risk taker and want to achieve a higher yield, I would suggest you to set up a globally diversified portfolio of about a 60 % Equity and 40% Fixed Income split to achieve 6-7% returns p.a. in 10-15 years.I'll look to set this up with a Financial Advisor and do some planning or with one of the Robos. Do make sure you understand what you'll be investing in as well. :)0 comments0"

Cos your salary would be credited into the account, I believe u should be able to grow the balance? Another interesting account to look at: I can explain more if u do not understand.https://www.citibank.com.sg/gcb/deposits/mxgn-savacc.htmCurrent tranche of SSB will get u about 2.57% if u held it for 10years. No point going for FD. ETF will be a totally different risk level, and it will require more detailed/separate breakdown analysis.   What do u need/plan to do with the money at the end of 10-15years?Do u intend to plan for retirement? Have u ever considered topping up CPF special account?You will earned a guaranteed rate of 4%. For the first $60k in your CPF combined balance (with only up to $20k max from OA), the monies will earn an extra 1%. You might not have passed the limit yet. Thus it is worthwhile to topup to earn effective 5% return. Risk-free, regardless of market conditions.In additional u will receive tax relief for the topped up amount. Eg, your taxable income is $40k, for every dollar u earn above 40k is taxed at 7%. Therefore, if u topped up $1000 into your special account, u get $1000 tax relief, u saved 7% of $1000 = $70 tax money. Effectively have gotten 7% return on your money, in additional u will earn 4%% interest yearly guaranteed.Also, have you already covered yourself with appropriate insurance. I advocate buying direct insurance (buy direct with insurer without the agent involved). If you have bought any life insurance or related products in the past few years, it might still be worthwhile to still compare.Are you taking on HDB loan, started in the last couple years? This is with regards to the HPS insurance. 0 comments0"
