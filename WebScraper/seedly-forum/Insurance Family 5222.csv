question,"Insurance Family Asked by AnonymousAsked on 31 Jul 2019Should I buy 1 more term or CI plan?Hi, I have two life insurance plans bought by my parents when I was younger. I am thinking of buying one more plan as the coverage was only slightly over $100k for the two plans combined. Both plans do cover CI but not much. What should I do?2 answersAnswerBump0"

There are some rules of thumb for establishing how much CI coverage you will need.Once you have established how much you will need for CI cover, subtraact your current coverage and take note of the shortfall. If the shortfall is significant, it is prudent to ensure that you increase your coverage accordingly to cope. Also, when you were younger, early CI coverage was not a thing, and you might consider also getting early CI coverage for more comprehensive coverage.Having said that, you should sit down with an advisor to run through the numbers before you decide if there is a need to increase your coverage or not. Many factors will come into plan when deciding the coverage amount, such as inflation and potential increase in future expenses due to life events (e.g. marriage/kids).

2,"Joyce Chan, Senior Financial Consultant at Prudential Assurance Company SingaporeLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 31 Jul 2019This is really dependent on your existing coverage and your needs. Is there a liability that you would want to get a term policy to cover? Or are you more worried about the costs of living should a CI strike? Different people would answer these questions differently. It'd be best to speak to your financial consultant to go through a thorough review and needs analysis to find out what's best suited for you in your next step.Hope this helps!0 comments1"
