1,Raimi JasmanLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 26 Nov 2018Never ever cancel or terminate your dpS! It is good to have and it is auto once u start working and have a cpf deduction. No cash is being use when u are working part time. It doesn’t cost much too! Jiaoyou!0 comments3
2,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Nov 2018Never cancel your DPS, especially if you don't have any other term or whole life insurance.
The Dependants’ Protection Scheme (DPS) is a term insurance that provides insured members and their families with some money to get through the first few years should the insured members pass away, suffer from Terminal Illness or Total Permanent Disability.

4,"Ck ChaiLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 27 Nov 2018Do not cancel DPS, the premium is just $36/year for 34 years old and below, and is deducted from your CPF only. DPS is a term insurance whereby benefit will be paid out to insured members and their families should the insured members pass away or suffer from Terminal Illness or Total Permanent Disability. It serves as a basic protection.0 comments1"
