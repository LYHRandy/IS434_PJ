1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Jun 2019Frankly it may be better if you locate each of the speakers and see if they have any free previews available. Paying this amount may get you some insights but on the follow up? Will they hand hold you through the strategies mentioned? Just something to think about before you commit further.0 comments1"
