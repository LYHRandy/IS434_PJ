3,"Ericsson TingLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 13 Jun 2019Yes,but dun't let the AAA fool you,remember to look into the financial sheet for info and understand itAs to why i say that,perhaps you could watch the movie ""the big short"" about 4 people who make money during the 2008 crisis,the movie tell us of stories that people really never read into what they brought into.It is probably one of the more interesting financial movie out there along with the wolf on wall street.The movie also mention the various rating agency who are selling rating for fees,do watch this clip from the movie :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwdo17GT6sgand the part where they explain about the rating:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hG4X5iTK8Mfor the full movie you could try netflix,or google it(if you know what i mean)btw do visit my blog @sonicericsg.blogspot.sg if you have the time2 comments1"
