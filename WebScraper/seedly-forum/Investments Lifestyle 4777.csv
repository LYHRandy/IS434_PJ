1,"Tee-Ming Chew, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 25 Jun 2019Hey Gabriel, we are usually quite low profile when it comes to announcing what's next for the product. The reason is because we don't want to overpromise our users with new features.But rest assured we do keep our top contributors (like yourself) notified about upcoming features in a private setting. So do look forward as I will drop you a message soon! :)1 comment3"
