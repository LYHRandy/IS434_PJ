MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Grab every opportunity that come by (if possible), exposing yourself to these opportunities will give you an edge over others. Open as many doors in your life because some day, some time, doors will close, so always have more than 1 avenue for you. Dab your toes in various stints, try out different things while you can (except the vices), so that you can eliminate what you don't want in life. What you have at 22 is time, so spend your time wisely. Read a lot, mingle with different people. Think long-term, don't be overwhelmed with the short-term stuffs :)1 comment1"
