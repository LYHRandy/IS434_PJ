1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 18 May 2019Looking at the previous comments, I also wanted to mention that your life is not all about your job. Yes, the lull of having a monthly salary is strong. But what I have learnt from speaking to people in their 60s/70s is that they wish that they spent their lives (and more specifically, youth) pursuing larger things other than money. If you know what you want to do + your savings allow it AND you have been unhappy/burnt out for awhile now, consider taking a break to explore your options. Or even if you don't take a break, consider what really makes you unhappy about your job. Because for all you know, you might jump into the next job and find out that you are unhappy for all the same reasons you are unhappy with your current one.0 comments1"

WonderkidAnswered on 15 Mar 2019To leech off Gabriel's answer, and to give you the best of both worlds, you can also suck it up and continue, while searching for another job / revenue generating business outside. This helps monthly cashflow, and also helps signal your continued attractiveness to potential employers.This financial consideration should then be weighed against the mental toll the current job and unhappiness is having on you - is it leading to severe depression / impact on interpersonal relationships; or is the unhappiness still tolerable, even if undesirable?0 comments1"

4,"Heng Kai LeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 07 Jun 2019Maybe sharing my personal experience might help.I worked as an Assistant English Teacher under the Japan Teaching Program for two years. I came back to Singapore and searched for a job from scratch.I first worked as a PR executive with an American-headquartered company. Dragged my feet to work every day. Cue Steve Jobs’ speech about changing something if you don’t like facing yourself in the mirror (or words to that effect). So I quit after my probation, without having first secured a job in place.It took me a month to find a relief teaching job. I subsequently turned full time at that school and lasted for five years.The jobs are out there. Just breathe and have faith.0 comments0"
5,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Mar 2019What is an alternative? Is there any other job/industry that you would rather be doing? If yes, you might want to consider pursuing your career in that industry instead.If not, you can think about what you would rather do. OR, like what the others have said, just work and invest and retire early.0 comments0"
