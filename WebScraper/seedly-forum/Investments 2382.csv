1,"Thaddeus Tan, Community Lead at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Mar 2019YOO, that depends on what you want to start investing with which also depends on your risk appetite. For low risk, low commitment instruments, you can consider SSBs (you can find out more about SSBs here) the minimum amount to start investing is $500, and you can only invest in multiples of $500. You don't have to actively monitor it but just wait 10 years before the bond matures.For robo-advisors, it is a low commitment instrument as the software helps you manage your investments Robo-advisors can automatically select investments and build a diversified portfolio for you. Once your funds are invested, on an ongoing basis, the software automatically makes changes to the investments to align your portfolio back to a target allocation. Different robo-advisors have a different minimum amount. Some examples of Robo-advisors in SG include Stashaway (min. $100) and Autowealth ($3000) You can find out more here. These are just some of the many investment instruments out there.0 comments2"
2,"PatLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 07 Mar 2019After you have set aside emergency funds and other necessary future cash flows (e.g. insurance, exchange...), with the remaining funds, consider your timeline. Are you in it to invest long term or short term? Do you have basic knowledge on finance/investments? If not, equip yourself with what is necessary. Don't jump in too quickly to get your feet wet unless you view yourself as the kind who 1) learns best through doing 2) won't be hurt if you do encounter heavy losses.The rest have suggested good investment instruments but I'll just like to add on about SSBs. Although the min is $500, but you need to consider the $2 application fee (and withdrawal fee if you withdraw early). If you're planning on withdrawing before the 10 years are up, I would suggest putting in more than $500 for one application so that the fees don't eat into your returns. Just a note.0 comments1"
3,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Mar 2019You can look at Regular Savings Plans, which require $100/month to start! Robo-advisots, such as Stashaway, also require only $100/month to start.Some other investment instruments include Singapore Savings Bond, which requires $500 lump sum. You can also look at opening a savings account with CIMB FastSaver, which gives 1% per annum without having to fulfil any requirements!0 comments1"
4,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019You can invest $100 monthly with a regular savings plan like POSB invest saver. Singapore savings bond and robo advisors are also another alternatives. However, it would be better for you to have a regular income, emergency savings and insurance ready first before getting into the more volatile investments like stocks. You should start with getting more knowledge about personal finance and investments first while you are still studying. Starting early is good but dont rush into things that you dont understand.1 comment1"
