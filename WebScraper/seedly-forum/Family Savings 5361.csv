1,"Leong Wen Fong, Economics and Management at University of LondonLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Oct 2018$5000 for 2 people is quite enough to go to a lot of places!If you prefer the city life, then I would recommend places like Taiwan, Hongkong or even Japan where the city is bustling, and there is noise and activity everywhere.However, the more rural parts of these countries eg. Hokkaido, Alishan, Are definitely more quiet, and something that I prefer as well! I recommend these places if you just like to walk/drive around to sightsee, and you're not really the shopping type!0 comments2"

Ops for self driving just download any 7 days itinerary from the internet and rent a car there and drive using Here we go GPS app free (download the map for office line and just turn on location service will do, don't need data). 0 comments1"
