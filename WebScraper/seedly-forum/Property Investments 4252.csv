1,"Leo KwekLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 31 Jul 2019It depends on your risk appetite and comfort zone as an investor. Investing in Overseas properties is very different from investing in Singapore properties.A few key points that you will have to take note about Overseas properties:
1) Political and Economic stability of that country
2) Currency fluctuations
3) Taxes and other miscellaneous fees
4) Ownership eligibility 
5) Remote management
6) Legal system
7) Securing loan These are just some of the points. Some of the popular countries that Singaporeans like to invest in are Melbourne, London and Bangkok. UK has fewer restrictions on foreign buyers whereas in Australia, foreign buyers can only purchase new property and not resale. And in Thailand foreign buyers cannot wholly-own land. As you can see buying a Overseas property is not as straightforward as buying a property in Singapore. However, it does not mean that one is better than the other. Do your research on the developer and market.0 comments1"
