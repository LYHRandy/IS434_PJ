1,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 22 Mar 2019As far as i know, there is none. You have to reinvest the dividends yourself. Singapore ETFs are not that good as well. I think you should take a look at ireland domiciled etf on london stock exchange. They reduce the US withholding tax from 30% to 15%, have more and better ETFs for you to choose and there are ETFs that re-invest dividends which they call Accumulating ETFs if that is what you are interested in.0 comments1"
