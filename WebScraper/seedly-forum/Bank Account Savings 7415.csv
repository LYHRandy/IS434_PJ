See how to hack this join Account legally here :http://investmentmoats.com/money/boosted-dbs-multiplier/The beauty of the Multiplier is that if you credit the salary, and transactions to a joint account shared with your spouse, or another person, both your DBS Multiplier accounts will earn the bonus interest if you qualify for it.7 comments0"
2,"See all 7 comments JDJohn Doe15 May 2019Yes but am not looking for a hack.  The multipler Account is a separate account which will earn higher interest.  The joint account where salary is credited only earns base interest.  I am looking for a joint account which is multipler and will earn higher than base interest upon salary creditHC Tang15 May 2019Not that I know off at the moment. Easiest and closest way is that you could turn one of the two DBS multiplier as joint and save combine funds there and leave the join account as it is. Once it hits the cap for high interest, move the excess funds to the join account or other liquid Investment instrument."
