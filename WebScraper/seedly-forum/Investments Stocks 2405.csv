1,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Apr 2019It is going to a tough 2019 ahead for Tesla, espeically with earnings report coming out this Wednesday and how thet are expected to make losses for Q1FY19 Even CEO Elon Musk said "" Tesla is unlikely to report a profit this quarter"".The first few months of 2019 spelled bad news for Tesla, renewing doubts about its future profitability, growth and cash position. This came at the back of how Tesla delivered about 63,000 vehicles in the first quarter, including 50,900 Model 3s - an underwhelming result when compared to the expectations of around 76,000 vehicles, including 54,600 Model 3s. Furthermore, demand for Tesla Model 3 will most likely weaken especially with federal electric-vehicle tax credits being reduced mid-year and going away at year-end. Coupled with that, competition for its luxury cars and even for the cheaper Model 3 could be heating up. The biggest competitor in the US will probably be the Chevy Bolt and other competitors include the likes of Nissan Leaf and Volvo's Polestar 2, which are both cheaper and long-range alternatives to the Tesla Model 3.0 comments1"
