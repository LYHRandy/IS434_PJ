WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi Gab, Douglas here, 2nd Keynote speaker from the event.Your qn is valid but probably too open ended for me to give concise advise. Do you first qualify for BTO? For me, my first property was a condo as I did not qualify for a HDB whether BTO, or resale.Assuming you qualify for BTO and Pte Condo, you must first understand the different rules and regulations subjected to you after you have bought it.You decision will also depend on the prevaling market condition then too. But in general, to BTO first and then sell to upgrade to a condo is a common strategy for Singaporeans for asset upgrading, which u can emulate. Those with enough resources will be able to rent it out and still buy their next private property without needing to sell their HDB.​​​
