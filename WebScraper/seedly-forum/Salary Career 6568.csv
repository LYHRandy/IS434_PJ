1,"Zach HoweLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 05 Dec 2018I was once in a similar situation as you where I asked for a position change to another department (doing a different scope).While at that new department, things are not working out for me, still I tried to hang in there till the end of the project.. However luckily for me, both me and my former manager did schedule to have a meeting after the end of the project to check and see how things are for me and what is the next proper course of action - to be 'officiallised' in that new role, or to go back to old dept. or something...And so before the said meeting happens, I did think long and hard of what I really wanted. Truth be told, a part of me is really really very glad that I am able to try out the new role, always thought it is one for me but guess what - I am wrong (perhaps I did not have a good guidance) and another part of me is sad as before moving to the new role - I was pretty much in a state of 'I am not going to do any more of old dept's work, yay'.In any case, I did go back to my old back but with added responsibilities. Somewhat of a mixed feelings but at least I felt that I am enjoying it a little more, if anything.Having said that, like others have suggested, do have a chat with your superiors. Hopefully something does works out for you!0 comments1"
2,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 04 Dec 2018I would suggest to give yourself a period of time of at least 6months to a year. I'm sure u would have a different/better perspective by then. Thereafter, if u are still unsatisfied with your work, u have a better reason to discuss with your superior. Asking for a demotion now can be detrimental to your career and probably relationships in workplace. If u are granted the 'demotion', things might not return to as before. Even if u decide to change Job then, it will be better on your resume to leave as a higher position. This will put u in a better position to find a better job u want.0 comments0"
