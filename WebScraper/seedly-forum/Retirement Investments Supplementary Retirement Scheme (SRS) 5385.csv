In fact, as long as your contribution is reflected in your SRS account by 31st December 2019, you will be eligible for the tax relief when you file your income tax for 2020. Individual banks have a cut off time.Having said that, I would recommend you do it by the first half of December before festivities consume your time and you might forget about it.0 comments6"
