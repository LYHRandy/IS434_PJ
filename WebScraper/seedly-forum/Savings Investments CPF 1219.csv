1,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019That depends on your objective and immediate needs.Do you need any cash in the immediate or near future? Like planning for house, BTO etc? As you are still young, I would suggest building up your personal cash savings first. Because you might want to use it for further studies, BTO in future, renovations, baby planning, wedding planning etcDo you need the tax relief? (I suppose in NS the pay is still low so no need to pay tax at all)For CPF topups, it can be top up to SA (which will grant you tax relief) or top up to all 3 accounts (OA, SA, Medisave), the allocation will be done for you, and the money split into all 3.4 comments3"
2,"See all 4 comments Gabriel Tham20 May 2019If you really really thought and planned well, and foresee yourself not needing the cash then it is good to get the risk free 4%. 

CPF SA needs careful thought because you can't even use it for HDB or medical.NYNick Yeo21 May 2019Ok thanks guys! Appreciate it alot :))"

MasterAnswered on 24 May 2019If you really want to forego the liquidity which you might need in the future, then MA topup shld be the first for you to consider, at least you can also use Medisave for paying part of MediShield plans.otherwise, you can consider ssb which is safer and may provide you with certain amount of liquidity such that you can redeem it within 1-2 months if necessary at arnd 2% avg yield per year..if you still have spare cash after setting aside some amount for emergencies, then at your age, you can try to explore riskier investment vehicles like stocks for potentially higher returns (but learn first and don’t overtrade if you are New in this)0 comments0"

If you're topping it up to save, I would say you might not start at CPF yet. You are still young and you will be facing an increase in your expenses due to marriage, housing, renovation etc. More cash on hand and liquid investments might make more sense currently. Use those cash and build up a pool of savings first (emergency fund) and once you have that in place, use your excess funds to invest. CPF top up might be when you're earning a good income and you got excess funds that you might want to use it to contribute to CPF so that you can bring down your taxes at the same time.0 comments0"
5,"Cindy TanLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 16 May 2019Don't rush to top up your CPF, especially since you are still so young. Cause once the money goes in, its not coming out till you are old. Make sure you have a good amount on hand first. Only top up your CPF if you have too much excess cash. But I would suggest, using that excess cash to invest in other stuff that you can withdraw in the next few years rather than thinking of putting the money in your CPF.0 comments0"
