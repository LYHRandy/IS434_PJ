MasterAnswered on 29 Apr 2019Hi there!You've hit the nail right on the spot with this line ""wait for the price to fall then invest and when the price increases wait for it to drop again before investing""STI ETF is currently trading at $3.39. Allow me to answer your question with another. When will the price fall? How much will it fall by?(Assuming you have an answer for the above question)What makes you so sure that the ETF wouldn't increase in price (for exaggeration sake) for the next year? Does it mean one wouldn't invest in the entire year? ""Stocks and weather have one thing in common, it's unpredictable""This is just to illustrate and reiterate Wei Ming's point on not timing the market. ETFs aren't very volatile hence its better to invest regularly and recurringly as compared to purchasing a stock that may provide you the opportunity to sell within the same week.0 comments2"
