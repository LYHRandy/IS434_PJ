So choose someone you prefer to work with, someone you can trust and are comfortable with. And if you can afford it, get a level term insurance over a longer period (up to 100 years of age), you can use this to replace your mortgage insurance. Its better because it won‚Äôt decrease(assuming you get a decreasing mortgage term) so it will provide additional money in the event of payout and can also
be reuse when you are looking to invest or buy in a second property.7 comments3"
2,"See all 7 comments Clarence Chua28 Jun 2019Yes there are level term mortgage insurance as well. Level term mortgage is also tied to your loan tenure while level term life is not. 

The pros of a level term life using to ‚Äúreplace‚Äù your mortgage term is that it
be reuse when you are looking to invest or buy in a second property. It also hedge the future risks of being uninsurable.

God of WisdomUpdated on 28 Jun 2019Currently NTUC's Mortgage Term policy seems to be the most cost competitive. But if you want a comparison across multiple insurers, let me know and I'll assist.
Also, you can apply for insurance right before you need to start paying for the mortgage.1 comment3"
