1,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Im also a poly student. I recommend learning more about investment first then you invest once you start working. Right now you dont have a regular income and most likely dont have emergency savings. If you were to lose money in the stock market, you might panic sell. REITs provide pretty good dividends if thats what you are into. High dividend doesnt mean good. Example is Starhub which gives 9% but they borrow money to pay dividend which is not a good thing. The way that i save money is by losing weight. Im overweight so i have to eat less to lose weight and thus spend lesser on food. (Most of my money are spent on food) There are not much way to save more as a student unless you go shopping alot, drink starbucks every day or go club every week. If you do all this and other similar things then you have to cut them down to save more. 1 comment1"
2,"Alcander Seow04 Feb 2019Hi Nicholes, I'm also from NYP, currently in SEG in Engineering with business. For investment, I'll consider the pros and cons before making my decision to invest or not. I too am slightly overweight (need to lose 10+ kg more). I try to spend $5 and below for each meal (Manna [$5.50, sometime + $2 soup], Koufu or south canteen [$5 and below <include drink>]), occasional sweet drink (Iced tea). As mentioned, I don't usually go shopping unless necessary, I'm more of a shut-in who focused on assignments than going out and play with friends. Clubbing is out off the question as I am yet at age to drink (Soon, this year).  Thank for the answer, appreciated it. "
3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hey there. I think it's great that you are thinking about investing at your age. I know I was mostly thinking about gaming when I was back in poly.For investing into dividend plays, look at reits with strong sponsors, like mapletree, capitaland or ascendas. Can't really go wrong with either of these. Look into the individual reits offered under each of time, find out which has been paying out stable dividends or even increasing over time, and consider buy into that. You may not be able to get a lot of shares with the amount you are setting aside but it's ok. Start small and keep adding to it when you can. You will need to open a cdp account as well before you can start investing. Do note that high dividend yields may not be a good thing as well. Case in point, look at Asian pay television trust where the dividend got cut and the price tanked.Besides lump sum investing, you can look to buying into the counter every month as well if you can set aside $100 a month for investing. Maybank ke's monthly investment plan does offer reits from the sponsor companies I mentioned. For the savings part, it's great that you are already focused on keeping to a budget. Try setting aside for emergency funds as well.  Hope this helps 2 comments1"
