MasterAnswered on 25 Sep 2018Honestly, you'd want to invest it in instruments that  will help you attain specific goals and breed discipline illiquid, regular savings plan type.​For someone who doesn't have a high amount of liabilities to pay off, you can devote as much of your salary to investing after covering your essentials (insurance, emergency fund) and you'd ideally invest in riskier, higher yielding funds while you're still young, before transitioning into more stable fixed income as you get older.​I'd love to help you with that, if you'd like, as my specialty is in investments. In the previous year, I yielded over 32% overall on equities net of fees. ​You can always reach me here: https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.54​​0 comments2"
