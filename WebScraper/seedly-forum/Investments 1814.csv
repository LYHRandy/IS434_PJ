1,"Serene TohLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019My immediate & gut reaction is ""NO""There's no guarantee you can get 10% back annually. But the 6% loan annual interest is guaranteed. Not to mentioned that 10% is extremely optimistic, Based on statistics, not many people can achieve this earning. (Unless you are super experience, then I'll ask if you have any tips instead XD)My personal opinion is, you should only invest anything you can afford to lose. Can you afford to pay the bank back should you lose this amount in your investment?Another consideration is the payment to the bank is monthly. Can your investment service this monthly loan? Otherwise can you service this loan monthly?1 comment1"

3,"Thanh DatLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 05 Apr 2019Hi members,If you are taking personal bank loan. Be sure that your payroll is able to service your monthly loan. (If the bank is using your credit card to give you the loan, better be extra careful to make sure you can make your payments every month) As we put aside if you can earn that guarantee 10%. For me myself..I take loan that's around 5% interest charges for a $3000 loan. But with fix deposit at the rate of 7.5% p.a. I can make up for interest charges. Same time I know I can service my loan every month. I be doing this for the past 2 years. Same time I'm doing it on compounding interest for long term. This is personal for me. Every members have their own way. But do consider do you have other payments to make in mind or planning that may affect you. (I still had a free cash flow that's earning me a yearly dividends of 3%).0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 13 Mar 2019If you are sure that you can make 10%, and that you can get the 10% consistently, then sure.However, do be cautious of investment instruments offering this relatively high dividend yield. The risks you take may be significantly higher.0 comments0"
5,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 12 Mar 2019Please be careful.The interest you owe cannot dispute and is confirmed amount. But the returns you get are questionable. It is not confirmed to get 10%. What if the returns fall?0 comments0"
