question,"Bank Account Savings Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 02 Oct 2018Best advice for someone who wants to invest but knows nothing about investing?Hi, I'm a female above 35 years of age and married with no kids. After selling my HDB flat, I have an extra 40-50k to invest. I know nothing about investing. Can you advise me on where I can invest this amount for good returns, nothing high risk as I do not know about investments? I do know about time deposits though but the returns are very small. What would be the best advice you can offer me? Thanks9 answersAnswerBump1"

1,"Jacky YapLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi there, actually i think the best thing you can donow  is just, get a broker account, deposit 1k - 2k inside, and just buy any stocks (something that you can see / understand eg local banks / telcos / big global companies), and then you will figure out the rest. ​Even if you lose some money (lets say 10% on the 2k), it's probably a small amount ($200) considering the fact that this will make you take action today. the inaction today will probably make you lose out on more money (in terms of compounded return) in the long term. :) 2 comments4"

3,"Adriel ThinLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Read up first before investing. If you want something that's low on risk, buy Singapore Savings Bonds (SSB).​If you are looking at stock investing, then definitely read up first. Some good websites include Budget Babe, Dollars and Sense and The Fifth Person.​May also wanna check on the defensive portion of your portfolio such as insurance.5 comments4"

However, do keep in mind that they are incentivised to promote the products which reward them the best commission and not necessarily the best for you. Moreover, the time taken meeting an adviser may be better spent reading some of the recommended articles on sound websites.

Millionaire teacher and Learn to Earn are 2 I'll recommend to start off with. Intelligent investor once you have done basics down. For investment instruments, since you may not want high risk, avoid stocks and stick with bonds, especially government bonds or corporate from strong companies. Once you are more comfortable with your risk appetite and can accept something riskier, look towards robo advisories. I'll recommend options as well but find a mentor who can teach this in a safe way. This is the only instrument I know where you don't need to be right to earn money from the market. All the best. 0 comments1"

God of WisdomAnswered on 02 Oct 2018You can purchase a globally diversified investment portfolio either through a Robo Advisor or a Financial Advisor.You can determine your risk profile and choose your asset allocation. My suggestion is to get a 65% Equity and 35% Fixed Income portfolio. This would be a pretty balanced portfolio and can achieve 6-8% returns per annum without much volatility. 0 comments1"

But as always, all investments come with risk so remember to diversify your investments and read up before investing into something, do not invest blindly 0 comments0"

Driving a car is not risky but not knowing or with limited experience in driving made driving a car risky.​You already buy and sell HDB, use the experience to understand more about property investment instead.​3 comments0"
