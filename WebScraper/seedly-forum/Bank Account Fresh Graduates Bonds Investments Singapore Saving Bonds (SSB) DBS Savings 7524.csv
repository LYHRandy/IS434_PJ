question,"Bank Account Fresh Graduates Bonds Investments Singapore Saving Bonds (SSB) DBS Savings Asked by AnonymousAsked on 15 Nov 2018If I have $10,000 in savings which I'm storing in my multiplier account, is it a good idea to use 50% of them to buy SSB, which offers higher interest rates?I currently have $10,000 in savings that I'm storing in my DBS Multiplier account as ""reserves"". Open to investing around $3k in equities, but the rest will be an ""emergency buffer"".Was planning to just keep them in DBS Multiplier to accumulate and grow wealth. I'm currently getting around 1.55%-1.85% in interest for my Multiplier account. Was wondering if it makes more sense to put $5-6k of these reserves in SSB instead, since even the 1st year interest is already higher than my Multiplier's?2 answersAnswerBump0"

2,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I'm guessing that 3k for equities, 5-6k in SSB, 1-2k in bank? Correct me if i'm wrong. Personally I dont quite feel safe with 1-2k for emergency (even though SSB is fairly liquid on weekdays during office hours). Maybe cut back on equities first. When you've saved a critical sum, then continue from there.2 comments0"
3,"Question Poster15 Nov 2018Yep, good with cutting back on equities and keeping 5k in bank :)

Would you think that investing 5k out of the 10k in SSB instead of keeping it in my savings account is a good idea? Worried that there's anything that I've failed to consider, before investing.Lok Yang Teng16 Nov 2018If you have no immediate need (about 5-10yrs), then sure go ahead."
