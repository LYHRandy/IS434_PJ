Such assistance may help cut expenses for his kids especially. If accumulated hdb arrears are an immediate concern, ask him to meet his mp to ask hdb for some grace.All the best.0 comments3"
4,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Oct 2018I believe that there are various financial assistance schemes available to help your family and yourself cope with the rising cost of living. For your kids, free textbooks, coupons for their recess etc. For your family, some organisations might send daily necessities (toilet paper, biscuits etc ) to your house every month0 comments0"
