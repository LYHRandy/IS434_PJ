1,"Siow Nan, Electrical And Computer Engineering at NusLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 05 Jul 2019Good card as the exchange rates are pretty good and close to the rates online.just need to be able to top up this debit card with a credit card, up to $3k limit.  You can change to aud anytime you think it is favorable, or if aud is not enough, youtrip will use your sgd balance and change it at current rates.i Usually TOP up with my phone right before the transaction so that my cash will not be locked up inside bearing no interest.1 comment0"

You top up and can use it locally or overseas (without even exchanging money), make online purchases or in-store and also able to withdraw money from atm. You can exchange to certain foreign currencies if you like too. Tip: exchange when the currency rate is good and keep until you use it. I‚Äôm going to Australia soon as well and I exchange an estimated amount when the rate was good not long ago, and use it to pay for accommodation, car rental, amount to be use for shopping/groceries etc. Even when you‚Äôre overseas, you can still top up from the linked account (I linked my credit card S$) and just use it for your payment. Love: Competitive rate, so much better than using your credit card overseas due to exchange rate. No need to exchange big amount of cash overseas. Very useful in countries with extensive use of credit/debit cards. I top up as and when I need it so i don‚Äôt have to worry about lost card, stolen money, being mindful about physical wallet with cash etc. Downside: the money in the ‚Äúwallet‚Äù cannot be refunded back to your e.g. bank account2 comments0"
