3,"Soh Sing HengLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 07 Sep 2018I would say the simplest is to go for BTO if you got a partner. BTO flats are heavily subsidised (around 100K lower than market value), but there will be waiting time involved. Now, these flats can be built within 2.5 years vs the 4 years before. If time is still a constraint, going for resale will be the next choice. I've written several articles on housing and property here: https://sgyounginvestment.blogspot.com/search/label/Housing%20and%20property​If you have higher income, you may consider EC or private condo. However, do make sure you calculate your affordability and also your loan eligibility. I've seen quite a few cases of people who purchase condos and then realise that they can't get the loan they require and end up have to forfeit some of the fees they paid. To understand the loan eligibility part, you can read my post on ""How much money do you need to own a condominium in Singapore?"": https://sgyounginvestment.blogspot.com/2014/02/how-much-money-do-you-need-to-own.html​0 comments0"
