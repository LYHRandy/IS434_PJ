1,"Ang Yee Gary, Medicine at National University Of SingaporeLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019For me I use ocbc 365 which gets 6 percent cash back up to 80 dollars.It really depends on Yr spending pattern and whether u want miles or cash back3 comments1"
2,"See all 3 comments Ang Yee Gary13 May 2019To get the cash back u need to spend 800.
Its just 300 more than to qualify for the extra interest in the ocbc 360 account.

After I reached 800 I will try to spend on cimb card but from June onwards the pressure is gone.Question Poster13 May 2019I see, the reason why i ask is because i personally feel that, it is quite hard to get the meaningful cashback everytime i spent around 800. This include groceries, dining, land transport and utilities."
