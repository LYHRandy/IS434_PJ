1,"Elijah LeeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 30 Jun 2019SRS is meant for tax savings. Hence if you have no income, there are no tax savings to be had. However, it is still worth to open an SRS account and deposit a dollar to lock in your SRS withdrawal age at the prevailing retirement age (currently 62). You can always re-visit SRS when you start working.2 comments11"
2,"EEva30 Jun 2019So how does SRS works?? Why must deposit a dollar to lock in your withdrawal age?Elijah Lee30 Jun 2019SRS works by reducing your taxable income for every dollar you put in. Putting in a dollar is to lock in your withdrawal age. You are free to contribute up to your SRS limit for tax relief, on a voluntary basis."

4,"Ryan PhamLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 18 Jun 2019As a 20 year old, unless your earning power is very high then you should use SRS. If not, I would save up the cash and setup a stock brokerage account. Do quarterly or half yearly purchase of ETF or hand pick some growth stocks
Use the power of compound interest to come out ahead in the next 20-30 years0 comments0"
