1,"Charmaine Ng, The Code Breaker at @ Every Chye Peng StallLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Aug 2018I'm not a financial advisor but I hope you've already got a hospitalization plan because that's pretty much the #1 thing you must have. I have personal accident to cover the time from hospitalization to full recovery (because even if company can give you hospitalization leave but you may not be able to get back to work by then and I need to make sure I'm covered for that period of time).â€‹I was on Prudential personal accident for coming 2 years and initially wanted to go for AIA for the (vitality programme ðŸ˜‚) but friend recommend SOMPO which meets my needs better because the coverage is more in line with what I want.. aka coverage on family expenses etc vs higher death benefits. I have the links to SOMPO, Prudential and AIA's personal accident plan brochure for you to go through but most importantly is you need to know what are your priorities and needs then speak to a reliable FA. Hope this helps!â€‹https://www.sompo.com.sg/docs/default-source/products-downloads/products/pa-star/pastar.pdf?sfvrsn=4â€‹https://www.prudential.com.sg/-/media/prudential/pdf/ebrochures/prupersonal-accident-ebrochure-english.ashxâ€‹https://www.aia.com.sg/en/our-products/accident-protection.html0 comments1"
2,"Eric Chia, Senior Financial Consultant at PrudentialLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 23 Aug 2018The attitude I have towards personal accident insurance is to have a peace of mind in my daily routine. Unlike life insurance or savings insurance, personal accident insurance is useful when you least expected it. And worse still, it happens even when you thought you had taken all precautions to prevent bad things from happening.â€‹It's not only about covering income, paying for the bills or profiting from it. It's about ensuring there's money to recover from accidents when it happens. No one knows when this comes but you need it when you least expected it!0 comments1"
3,"Luke Ho, Venture Capitalist at CFXLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Aug 2018Personal accident plans are important because they help cover that gap between outpatient and hospitalization that many people really neglect. A fracture or a broken arm or finger can rack up thousands on thousands - quite a bit over weeks of treatment but not a day of hospitalization. â€‹People tend to buy Group Term PA for it for the price, but it isn't quite as comprehensive as a personal one - so there's really no reason not to get one, especially if you like Traditional Chinese Medicine treatments. 0 comments1"

Personally I rely on the saf group personal accident. It is low cost. In the grand scheme of things the personal accident is the lower priority insurance that you should get0 comments1"

It will be good for people of all ages to be covered so that in the event that accidents happen there will at least be a coverage.â€‹i have gotten the aviva  for Nsmen and it is pretty low cost. â€‹Yes there is no returns on this but but it is risk transfer.0 comments0"
6,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Aug 2018Reasons for geting personal accident plans are as per what Luke has stated.â€‹Do also check out if your company has existing Personal Accident Plans, on top of which some form of medical benefits which allows you to claim TCM, or medical treatment.â€‹If none, you can consider getting such plans which typically starts for about 96/yr or $0.26/day. â€‹Claims from such policies are usually not difficult. Recently, one of my clients suffered a fall, and had to do MRI and X-Ray scans but was not hospitalised as the doctor did not deem it as necessary. Subsequently, she also had to go for physiotheraphy. All the above cost are claimed with a hitch from the insurer.â€‹If you would like to find out more, drop me an email at brandan.chen@manulife.com.sg0 comments0"
