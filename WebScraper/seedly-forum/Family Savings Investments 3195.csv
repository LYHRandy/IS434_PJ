MasterAnswered on 25 Oct 2018Property is good as long as you have the money to pay the downpayment and the monthly instalments in an increasing interest rate environment. As long as you have the holding power in a property market downturn, you could consider buying property. 0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 25 Oct 2018You'll have to make sure that you have at least 6 months of your salary saved as an emergency expense. Only invest anything above that.I'd try and focus on getting side gigs or starting a small and nimble online business for extra income. If not, you can set up a dividend paying portfolio or purchase some REITs or a share of a coupon paying bond.Property is just too illiquid for my taste and rental income is not guaranteed. 0 comments0"
