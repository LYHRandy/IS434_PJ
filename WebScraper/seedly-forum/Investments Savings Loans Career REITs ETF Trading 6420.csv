Or signing on with the company, and they sponsor at least part of it as part of a bond?With a $2k pay for the next 6 years, and assuming it doesn't increase even with inflation, it's going to take a little more help to get $100k, unless you can save $1,500  12  6  = $108,000.Mathematically it is possible to get to your goal, provided you save very aggressively. That said, learn skills on the side, and see what additional income you can generate. $100k may seem like a big amount but trust me you can get there slowly but surely :)0 comments1"

Assuming if you take a very aggressive saving approach and save 50% of the $1600, you will be saving $800 a month and $9600 per year. I would say use a portion of your money to invest in yourself first. Buy books, go for seminars, learn a skillset that you can leverage. This will boost up your income. With a higher income it would make saving much easier. Very early in my career, I invested heavily in myself and never ever regret it. That allows me to have the excess funds to invest. And if you're thinking of what are the skills to learn, go and learn about sales and marketing. These are highly valuable skils that can make you a fortune.0 comments1"
