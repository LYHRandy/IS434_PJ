ProdigyAnswered on 20 Jun 2019Short answer is No - there is no ""parent SRS topup rebate"" as far as i know from my personal experience trying to minimize my tax payments over the past few years of working.An alternative is to simply top up your parents CPF account instead, which provides up to $7k rebate on your income tax. If you already working chances are your parents are pretty close to the CPF withdrawal ages anyway, which will mitigate the lockup of the cash topup.0 comments0"
