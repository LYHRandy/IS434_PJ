1,"Jaren Ng Kok LiangLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 26 May 2019I just use BOC eilte mastercard for my tax and insurance fees via cardup service. It give 1.5miles per dollar spend. For cardup fees, there is a $20 dollar rebate if you use referral code (KOKLIANGN59). So it work out to be about 1.7% for first transaction. Thought is still quite worth it.0 comments0"
