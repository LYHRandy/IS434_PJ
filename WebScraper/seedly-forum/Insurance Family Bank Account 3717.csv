Of these plans, 2 are ECI and CI plans from GE, amounting to ~$2.7k annually.

God of WisdomAnswered on 09 Jul 2019As a guideline, you should not be spending more than 10% of your income on coverage. At $2.7K, this is 9% of your annual income. Hence, the question I would like to ask is, what are you spending the remaining $7.3K on?Insurance is risk management. No family history does not imply that one will not contract any critical illness. Should such a situation occur to you, your financial burden will be tremendous and that is where your policy will relief you of financial burden while you cope with recovery. I would never invest without insurance coverage as there is no way I can conjure up $200K from the markets overnight should something happen to me. I would suggest reviewing your portfolio to see what is essential and what is not, as I know that cashflow can be tight when 1/3 of your income is going to various policies. Let me know if you need a second opinion.0 comments8"
2,"Eric Chia, Senior Financial Consultant at PrudentialLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 10 Jul 2019Just a few pointers to note:1) You are thinking of using money which has been set aside to protect your wealth, on accumulating wealth. These 2 purposes are totally different and if you do not have enough money, you should earn more or spend less, so that you have money to use for wealth accumulation.2) It's precisely that you're healthy and have no family history that you are able to get life insurance coverage. Once your health deteriorates, or when you grow older, the chances of getting coverage becomes lesser and more expensive. In general, people lose between $1k to $5k of coverage per year that passes.3) You're putting in about 10% of your income in insurance, which is pretty standard in the market. The $2.7k should not include savings plans, it should be a budget set aside for protection. So theoretically you're in a sweet spot for coverage. Surely you would not want to ask your parents for money if you fall sick and are unable to work?4) You should consider reviewing the coverage amount with your agent. What CI and ECI plans do you have? Is the coverage amount sufficient, would it meet your expectations in case you fall sick?5) You may also like to consider these questions. How eager are you in investing? How confident are you that you'll make money from investment?Find someone to talk to before making any decisions, so that you'll not regret your choice now. :)0 comments1"
