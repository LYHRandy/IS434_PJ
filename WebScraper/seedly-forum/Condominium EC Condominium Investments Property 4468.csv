ProdigyAnswered on 30 Oct 2018Usually condos with maintenance fees of $1000 and more comes with a private lift in the unit and quite a fair bit goes into maintenance of the lift as well! Luxury condos are definitely worth it in the long run. Quite a huge percentage are owned by foreigners (if they need to pay 20% ABSD, they would rather own a more prestigious one) as they diversify their portfolio and they want to own prime locations in Singapore. As long as you time your exit, there is a huge resale value for D9 luxury properties in Singapore. 0 comments1"
