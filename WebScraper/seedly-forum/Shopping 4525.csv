It is as advertised, but has poor UI, minimum top-up and limited items. Would only recommend if you buy a variety of productsWhat I like:it is as advertised where price keeps dropping. E.g. there's a $10 Coffee Bean gift card for sale at $1+ at the end of the dayWhat I dislike:App UI is slightly overwhelming and confusing as it is rather different from the typical e-commerce appThere's a lack of variety of items for sale daily.A minimum of $30 has to be topped up before you can start purchasing.
