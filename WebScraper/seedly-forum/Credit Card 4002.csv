3,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Aug 2018UOB One account. The perfect fit, in my personal opinion.​https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/chequeing/one-account.page​As long as you spend $500 per month through your card, pay 3 bills via GIRO, you earn interest. The above landing page will explain more.​Besides, you earn cashback based on your card spend, which is a sweet deal.​Reviews from Seedly for your consideration.​https://seedly.sg/reviews/savings-accounts/uob-one​https://seedly.sg/reviews/credit-cards/uob-one-cashback​Hope this helps!0 comments1"

6,"Tee-Ming Chew, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 02 Aug 2018I think most people will recommend the CIMB FastSaver! The reason is because you don't need to fulfil any requirement to get a 1% interest on your savings!​As for credit card, I'm not really sure if there is any requirement for freelancer. Interested to know as well!0 comments0"
