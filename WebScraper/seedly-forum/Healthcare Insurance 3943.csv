God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Sadly the last available moratorium hospital plan just stopped accepting new proposals.But you can just go through full underwriting and declare your condition.You'll most likely still be accepted but with exclusions. 2 comments4"
2,"Jee Lee23 Jan 2019Hi, thanks for answering! :) just wondering, will I be accepted with exclusions for sure? If Im still undergoing treatment. The insurance agents i've spoken to only recommended endowment plans. In the event that say i get accepted for a term or whole life insurance, what will the exclusions be? Hariz Arthur Maloy23 Jan 2019Hi Jee, you could have stayed anonymous, but thanks for sharing. Endowments aren't going to give you the coverage you require. It's not a for sure, you'll have to apply and see, but apply to all companies at the same time, see which one gives you the best deal. Currently in SG, all life plans have a one year exclusion for payout due to suicide. This could extend to a lifetime exclusion for suicide and any accident that was caused by self harm.

This is because almost all insurance cannot be bought (depression is really the worst since you may just die from it).I agree with Hariz and up voted him. Do try your best to get included or see what other solutions you can use. 0 comments0"
