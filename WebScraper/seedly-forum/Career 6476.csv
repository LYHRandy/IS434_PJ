question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 24 Mar 2019What do you deem as the most important factor when looking for your first job?I'm about to graduate this year and currently on a job hunt.

1,"Justin Kieran OngLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 25 Mar 2019As someone that just graduated recently, I feel that a good boss, a supportive environment and a willingness to learn are key.Since you would just have started working, unless you really need the money, money should not be the key concern. You will always get more chances at a pay raise later on if you continually upgrade yourself.A good boss and the environment will also help what you learn. Never underestimate what a good mentor can teach you.All the best in your finals and job hunting0 comments1"

I feel that work culture/environment/benefits/salary will matter more later, but in the early years, learn as much as you can, as fast as possible. Do this by getting the opportunity to help out in areas outside of your job scope. Managers/bosses who can feel your enthusiasm will be able to give you opportunity to progress beyond your current limits and knowledge.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 24 Mar 2019As a sophomore I think this is something that is very relevant to me and it's also something that I always consider.Personally, I value career progression because I feel like for the first job, it is imperative that I learn as much, as fast as possible. Also, I'm someone who likes to work towards a goal and having milestones (such as clear career progression roadmap) in the workplace really motivates me.I guess ultimately it depends on what drives you to drag yourself out of bed at 7am on a weekday morning and look forward to the rest of the day.0 comments1"
