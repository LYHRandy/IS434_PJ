MasterAnswered on 08 Sep 2018Like what Gabriel said, Seedly has written an article about it, but here are some excerpts on the article to give you an idea!​Prenatal Check-Ups – $1000 to $2000Take note that your the trimester begins on the first day of your last period which means, which means by the time you find out that you’re pregnant you probably enough time to schedule in 2-3 check-ups in your first trimester.​Baby Supplies – $4000 – $27,500​Cost of delivery - $6000 - $19,000Hospital bills can cost anywhere between $6,000 to $12,000 for a normal delivery and $10,000 to $19,000 for a C-section. This depends on the ward that you will be staying in, the type of hospital and if you’ll be opting for an epidural or any other side services.​In summaryA child can cost you around $18,000 a year and approximately $360,000 at the end of 20 years. So, it’s time to start saving for this because a child is going to be your biggest investment!​0 comments0"
