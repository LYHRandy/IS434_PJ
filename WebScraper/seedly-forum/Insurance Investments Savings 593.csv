1,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 22 Aug 2019Are you looking into getting serviced and with an independent or Tied Agent (Prudential)?There are many advisors out there with different values and beliefs.(1) The most important criteria is that they should have a fiduciary duty to you. All Tied Agents do not have a fiduciary duty to you.(2) Their knowledge should be there. Preferably someone with ChFC or CFP etc. But certification doesn't mean anything, because they may still not hold their ethics high enough.(3) They should educate you on what common pitfalls to look out for. Like waiting periods, investment risk, your investment mindset or protection needs. They should be transparent with you on the fees and charges from the start, and especially if you ask them.You are the driver of your ship, always remember that. Advisors only advise the pros and cons, and what fits your plan. Hence, I agree that MoneyOwl can be a platform for you or other independent advisors who you can click with.Tied Agents have some disadvantages, but it's up to your preference.2 comments3"

Contact insurer directly?Loh Tat Tian22 Aug 2019If you bought from Direct Insurance, you will need to contact the customer service, fill up the relevant claim forms required yourself, and submit them.

Their role is just to sell insurance products.Whether they answer your questions or provide customer service is totally up to them, beyond your control.Best to take charge of your insurance plans and learn how to DIY your claims.9 comments0"

10,"Luke Ho, Kick-Ass Financial Services Consultant at Trillion Financial PlannersLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Aug 2019You choose someone who solves the conflicts of interests by addressing them when you ask1) How much do you make from this product2) Are there any other options3) Why you, over someone else4) Expectations for future service and reasons for themE.g. ""I will review with you once a year because it's in my interest to do so since your needs change and I want to create customer loyalty.""
I actually say this.
