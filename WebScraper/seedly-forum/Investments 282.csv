Expect Keppel Shares to jump to around $7.35 once trading resumes (trading halt is a maximum of 3 days). You can lock a profit if you wish, or, pending their 'stategic review', hold on if you expect that the business will improve in time to come.0 comments7"

ProdigyAnswered 1d agoIt’s a good opportunity to see some capital gains as one of the logical reasons why Temasek would want to invest more is that it sees potential in it. 51% would let Temasek take control of Keppel. ""The partial offer reflects our view that there is inherent long term value in Keppel's businesses, notwithstanding the challenges presented by the current business and economic outlook,"" Tan Chong Lee, Temasek International's president, said in the statement.Today keepel is 5.84 and yet Temasek is offering 7.35. Whatever next steps they take, the share price should go up. Get ready to huat. Unless you’ve bought it at more than 7.35 previously0 comments1"
