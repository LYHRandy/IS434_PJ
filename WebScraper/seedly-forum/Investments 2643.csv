1,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Feb 2019Hello! To me, investing in cryptocurrecy is to big of a risk after seeing what happened with bitocin. I personally would not invest in cryptocurrency. However, if you want to invest in cryptocurrencies, it is essential that you do not place all your investments solely into one currency and also do enough research before investing in ICOs.Hope this helps!0 comments0"
