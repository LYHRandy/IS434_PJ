MasterAnswered on 12 Apr 2018Disclaimer: I have no experience with their customer service and fine prints personally, this are what I have heard from my friends..It is really easy to purchase an insurance from FWD. However, a friend of mine lost his phone on a overseas trip due to an accident and he only managed to claim partially because there was a hidden cap in the fine prints. I do suggest to read up more on the fine prints before deciding on either of them to see what suits you better! Sadly, I do not have experience with Hong Leong Travel Insurance as of now..You can read more reviews of them below:

3,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 13 Apr 2018Actually, this is a good question... I've never used Hong Leong Travel insurance before and used FWD for over 5 times. When I visited the HL Travel Insurance site to read up on the information, it was quite similar. But very few of my friends have actually used it before. Hope you find out and let us know here as well!0 comments0"
