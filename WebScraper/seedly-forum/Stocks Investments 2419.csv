1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 06 Mar 2019If by efficient you are referring to the Efficient Market Theory, then no, the market isn't really efficient due to the following reasons.Firstly, investors perceive the information very differently and may value differently also. Secondly, the theory also assumes that everyone will achieve the same returns, which is definitely not the case. Thirdly, this theory that investing in indexes would yield the highest returns, which is not really true also. Fourth, human emotions can cloud our judgement also. Fifth, information isn't disseminated so quickly and some people have different information... We can go on and on but the market isn't efficient but that's how people can capitalise on it.0 comments0"
