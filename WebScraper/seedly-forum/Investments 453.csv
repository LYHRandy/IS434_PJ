6,Kobe AlfanteLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 13 Sep 2019Pareto International Limited is a very good platform to invest your money to earn extra income. I've been invested in Pareto Forex Copy Trading and the results are awesome 5 to 10% of ROI every month consistently. So I recommended to my friends and family to joined and earned passive income.The great thing about Pareto is all of their results are verified on https://www.myfxbook.com/members/pareto/client7/33114560 comments19
7,"Jack JackLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 19 Jul 2019I have sat in on their business opportunity, although the speaker was a little corny, what he said made sense. Got to befriend some of the people who also attended the talk and have been told that they are making decent returns. I am going to observe a bit further before deciding to commit or not.0 comments20"
8,"Jonni GgLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 17 Sep 2019The obvious red flag here is the unrealistic returns they claim to achieve and their referral incentives, both classics characteristics of a Ponzi scheme.
When trying to join, you will be directed to a shady Hong Kong registered broker called ""VGX trade"" with a suspiciously plain website. Upon creating an account with VGX, the only funding option available is a bank transfer to a Hong Kong bank account under the account name ""Pareto International Holding"". On top of that, the copy trade agreement provided by VGX lists the same address as Pareto and even signs off with the name and IC number of the ""Chief Trader"" of Pareto.It's apparent that VGX and Pareto are the same guys and they do not even appear to be trying to hide the fact. This means that your funds are directly under the custody of an unlicensed company not even registered in Singapore (so much for the whole ""Copy Trading"" schtick). I believe this is also how they fabricate their trading results on myfxbook as they are the brokers themselves, they can feed in whatever data they want.I wonder what their end game is with this scheme and how it will eventually unravel but I hope no one is dumb enough to actually hand them your money.PS. If anyone at Pareto sees this, whats with the pathetic shilling attempt on this thread? Surely you can fake more believable positive reviews?5 comments15"

I am also dumb enough to have withdrawn whatever I have invested plus profit into my dbs bank account.

11,"Erin LimLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 22 Jun 2019U should do a research on what happen to fortis moneta first, cos one of the boss copy whole thing and came out to set this new one up, previously all in fortis moneta all had been scammedim a previous employee of that firm, i myself also invested 3k USD, not a single cent is backto be honest, if the trader is good, he wont be employed as a employee in the company to trade, he could just retire and trade comfortably at home...to do copy trading easily u can look at "" FBS Copytrade"" full access to u without any lock downor u could learn how to do trading yourself first, as a newbie start from a demo account2 comments9"
12,"Samson Seah22 Jun 2019Hi i was like you, i put my money in fortis 3k USD for their copy trading services, from the first week i tried to take out some money, then they told me all of a sudden that i need to wait for 1 month, then after that after one month can only take out the profits not the principle. then after that the person who was taking care of my account suddenly just left. I last heard that alot of people from fortis have went to set up a new company already. got to be careful.Chua Kim Leong3w agoHonestly, I only know Ryan face to face around May. For knowing him 5 months, observing in every details, he doesn't seem a scammer but an upright man. I ever encountered quite a few scammers before so I know the behaviour of real scammers. I even talked to Ryan about the Fortis' case, he and the rest of the staffs are also victim themselves, being scammed by the real mastermind. They even hired people to chase after their money after Ryan knew the company is running a money game but the person is too good in hiding as he might have planned all these while. I suggested all of you why not have a gentlemam discussion with Ryan, on how to gather everyone's force to pull out the real mastermind and put him in jail together. I won't mind being the bridge between you all with Ryan so that we can join force to put Real SCAMMER into jail and not seeing real victim, being tainted as scammer. Anything can simply whatsapp me at 90704025."
13,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Jun 2019Some questions to ask yourself and to your friend or to the company. How assessible are your funds if you do invest with them? Track record of the cfd trader and/or trading algorithm? Costs involved? Who is the broker or custodian used? Any minimum amount to fund the account with? Need to ask yourself this as well - why get into something you do not understand. There is no get rich quick pill when it comes to investment or trading. Can be a scam for all you know. Success comes with grit, hard work and lots of errors made and lessons learned. Why not learn cfd trading yourself?0 comments6"
14,"Jackson TengLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 18 Sep 2019Was approached by a friend‚Äôs friend re Pareto as well. Was reading what @Jonni Gg had to say on this thread, so I have decided to do further background check on Pareto and VGX myself in hopes of finding out who they are and what we are really investing in - in short, it is pretty much a fruitless effort - the more i researched into it, the shadier it seems. I now have more questions than answers by the end of this little research!First of all,  I‚Äôd love to know more about VGX or Veritas Global Exchange - since Pareto claims that VGX is the only private broker that they are working with to run their copy-trade service. I started googling and guess what I found..? I found nothing - absolutely NOTHING. Their homepage literally says ‚ÄúGet Ready... Something Really Cool Is Coming Soon‚Äù, which frankly, is not cool at all. So then when is VGX set up? is VGX a licensed entity? How long have they been operating? Do they need any licence from MAS to provide brokerage services? Who is the management team behind VGX? Why did Pareto choose to work only with VGX from the various other platforms available? Questions unanswered.Moving on to Pareto - the main concern really, is that they are not licensed by MAS to provide CFD copy-trading services (mind you, offering and marketing such services are also considered as ‚Äúdealing with securities‚Äù under the MAS regulations). It is actually a criminal offence for Pareto to offer the copy-trade services, and if they (or the chief trader) is convicted - guess who‚Äôs going to do all that trading for you then? And what would the regulators do with our funds? Perhaps they would freeze the accounts? More questions unanswered.And now that @Jonni Gg mentioned Pareto and VGX are the same guys... even if our accounts with VGX are held separately and that our funds can only be accessed by the two separate entities (VGX and Pareto), this makes no difference because they are technically owned by the same guys.So... to whoever is considering investing their money in this, I would definitely steer clear given the many red flags this has already raised. To those who have invested, I‚Äôm not really sure what you can still do at this stage. Suggestions, anyone?1 comment5"
15,"Chua Kim Leong3w agoAt beginning, I also thought like you from the outside. After being an investor myself, and I even get to know the people there well, then I know what I thought initially is not actually what it is üòÖ"
16,"Roy LimLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 20 Sep 2019I have been following the chief trader Ryan for years as well as being in his copy trading services. I highly doubt he will ruin his many years of forex reputation to get involved with a ponzi scam or etc. there are some doubts which is understood, but as an investor with Pareto since day one, I have never had an issue with funding or withdrawals. Everything is strictly through the banks, which makes it even more secure for customers.
if anyone has knowledge about forex trading, anything between 5 to 15% (as pitched by Pareto), is highly achievable. I wouldn't call it 'unrealistic'As a startup, there is definitely room for improvement, however, in terms of transparency, responsiveness and customer service, the staff under Ryan has always been fast to provide feedback and/or to alleviate my concerns. they have indeed done a good job so far, in spite of all the hate and negative comments5 comments4"
17,"See all 5 comments Chua Kim Leong3w agoI totally agree with Roy Lim.Chua Kim Leong3w ago[Giang Dang] Since a pig can't fly, can a pig say that flying in the air is bullshit? üòÖ ... everything needs time to grow, to clean and to clear the air. Can you say that I am shady just because you can't see me when I am a fetus in my mum's womb? Can you say that I am not doing anything to grow when I am a fetus in my mum's womb? We are humans, not god, only when we are in the house, then we can know exactly what in the house, and not trying to know what in the house simply by standing outside. That's crazy, right? üôÇ"
18,"JackLevel 2. RookieUpdated 4w agoUnregulated, endlessly flaunting their ridiculous ‚Äùreturns‚Äù based on copy trading. Endlessly finding new clients to fund their company by recruiting naive staffs, with some young ones to bring in more clients. Their company is just run by another one of those that were previously on MAS watchlist as well. Do look out for fortis moneta Pte Ltd, why did they suddenly become inactive when they are doing well? Thread with high caution. All signs of a Ponzi scheme. It‚Äôs funny how they‚Äôre creating accounts even on seedly to post positive reviews.5 comments2"

A bad thought will lead you to a bad path always ... be mindful.Roy Lim3w agoHi Jack you seem to have a grudge against them as well. First, does unregulated means blacklisted? Next, returns have been notarized and produced for all to see, how is it 'flaunting'? How is 5-10% unrealistic if you really do trade? If the company has its way to 'recruit' youngsters, it is their way of doing things. What has that got to do with you spamming them on seedly? Your comments are just as ignorant as your calling of pareto creating 'fake' accounts to post positive reviews? What about others here who may be from competitors trying to bring ryan down. There are always two sides, please be more fair in your opinions. I am an investor with ryan for years and he has always taken time to explain everything to me, i dont even get this transparency or time with other forex traders or companies."
