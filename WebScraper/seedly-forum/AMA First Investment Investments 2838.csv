question,"AMA First Investment Investments Asked by Lok Yang TengAsked on 29 Jan 2019Is SGX a good hunting ground?Is SGX able to provide good returns? I find SG to be more of trading rather than investing due to the nature of the economy. Currently investing in Bursa, but MYR to SGD hasn't been good. Considering US but there's withholding tax.3 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I won't consider SGX good for trading. Market volume is so little, price movement is so small. There are successful trader doing SG market but is not easy to do.Just take the highest volume stock in SG, and you can see the price movement everyday. 1 day up 10 cent, next day down 10 cent, maybe after 1 month only move 20-30 cent. You need big capital or leverage to get the most profit out of small movements.But for US markets, if you do trading, 1 week price movement is enough.2 comments1"

3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019For dividend yield plays, sgx is rather good compared to other markets, I'd think. For US market, if you are keen to invest long term without the headache of withholding taxes either buy into the S&P500 ETF that is domiciled in Ireland, or learn to hold an options portfolio. 3 comments0"

5,"Ashley Wong, Financial Assistant at Multi Management & Future SolutionsLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 29 Jan 2019SGX is good but may not be as profitable as US market. Being a very constrained market, SGX doesn't offer much to traders and investors. Small Price movement is also another important concern for SGX investors.0 comments0"
