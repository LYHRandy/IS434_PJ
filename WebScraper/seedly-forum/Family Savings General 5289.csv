1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 13 Mar 2019Like the others have mentioned, it's key to find your own accommodation first. I personally would set aside a budget for this, as well as alimony and other big cost buckets. Additionally, you might need to add mortgage payments for the HDB, depending on whether the HDB has been fully paid for already.Next, I would look into insurance coverage. Ie. Is there enough to protect yourself, or are there even insurance policies that don't serve you now at 46? I guess six months of cash set aside seems to be the general rule of thumb - I would then look at investing the rest, depending on your risk appetite. Apart from financial investments, invest in yourself. This could be anything from health (because we all know how expensive it can be should one not be well), to doing the things you always wanted to do in your life. As the saying goes, the best things in life are the people you love, the places you go, and the memories you make :)0 comments1"

When you are comfortable and stable with less worries, you may want to think through:$400,000 is a bonus. $1,500/mth can be saved after all liabilities addressed.How much do you have in your CPF a/c - you can use the CPF Life calculator to estimate the amount of monthly income you can possibly receive.Will that amount be sufficient?Do you have the necessary insurance to protect yourself and the $400,000 savings you have?What is your risk appetite if you have decided to do investment?How long are you able to stay invested?When do you think you would like to liquidate/cash out your investment?What is the lifestyle you would like to lead from now?Like what they have mentioned, it is advisable to educate yourself in various financial instruments. Your actions will result in reactions/consequences. Your knowledge will help increase the number of choice you can make. Get more information and make a decision with a consequence you are willing to bear.0 comments0"

Start a retirement plan and work towards achieving it. These are few options:InvestmentsPurchasing AnuitiesPick up a hobby (good for health)Read on wealth managementEnjoy life your own way. ​You're 46, take some time off alone to unwind and plan out your life. It will get better from there. 0 comments0"
