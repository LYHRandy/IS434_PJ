1,"Jim NgLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 28 Oct 2018For wealth protection (insurance):Take up an Integrated Shield Plan, along with the rider to ensure that your hospitlisation bills are 100% covered (minus the 5% co-payment that the government has recently introduced). This is crucial as you have to protect your own wealth first before you can protect your family by leaving behind a sum for them.Next, ask yourself, who are your dependents? Are they your parents? Or do your parents not need you to leave behind a sum since they've planned for their retirement? Calculate how much you need to leave behind for them.If you wish to set aside some money for them in the event of your death/disability/critical illness, you could plan on getting some life insurance (MINDEF/MHA Group Term Scheme at $1milllion dollars for $41 per month) just in case you pass on, critical illness insurance (You could add a rider on MINDEF/MHA Group Term) to replace your income and a simple disability policy (most companies rates are the same) to replace your income.For wealth accumulation / savings accounts:You can consider using Singapore Savings Bonds to deposit your monthly income (if you can save aside $500 at least) , the interest rate is extremely competitive as compared to local banks' savings accounts/fixed deposits/current accounts. It is fully liquid and you can take out anytime you wish to.Starting at 1.8% in the first year, with no minimum requirements to hit any spending or depositing or paying of any bills or any insurance payment, unlike the banks.Read more on my article on why I recommend SSB here:https://savesmartsingapore.com/2018/10/27/the-difference-between-singapore-savings-bonds-vs-endowment-plans-that-every-adult-should-know/0 comments2"

MasterAnswered on 28 Oct 2018As a fresh grad, there may be different forms of liability or short term expenses you may face:Student LoansBTOWeddingRenovationAll the above differs from individuals to individuals but majority of fresh grad will face these liabilities within the first 5 years of work.Consider first setting aside part of your income to cater for these potential expenses and set aside 6 months of rainy day money.When it comes to insurance, there is no such thing as best plans but rather what type of plans are best suited for you.Consider getting a hospitalisation plan first, which will cover you from hefty medical bills should you be faced with one.Subsequently, get yourself covered with critical illness insurance if your budget allows for it. This is to ensure that you lock in a lower premium and your current health status. The aim for such insurance is to provide income protection while one focus on fighting the battle against CI when diagnosed.If you are planning to get married soon, perhaps you can consider maxing out your Mindef Group Term to S$1M at S$41 per month.As for savings accounts, it really depends on whether you are able to meet the different requirements for DBS, UOB, OCBC. If you are unable to meet the requirements, perhaps CIMB may suit you better by providing a 1% (or 0.88%) interest with no conditions0 comments0"
3,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019In my opinion, the most important insurance plan to get is the hospitalisation plan. It covers most, if not all, of your hospitalisation fees, including most treatments/surgeries. As for savings account, seedly actually has a calculator that you can use to calculate which account suits you the best: https://seedly.sg/tools/savings-account-calculator1 comment0"

5,"Luke HoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Oct 2018People without an income really only need minimal insurance to make sure they're not a burden to society, so a hospitalization plan (upgrade your  Shield plan) and ensuring your insurability with a Term or Hospital plan for several years of your current expenses would be good Typically no more than $60,000 for any category if you're on a tight budget, since you shouldnt be spending $1000/mth as a student/unemployed. 0 comments0"
