1,"Isaac ChanLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 21 Feb 2019Here is a simple chart showing how bond prices, inflation and yield correlates. The mechanism behind this has been illustrated by others already. If inflation rises, it usually is bad news for bond holders. One can hedge against this using Inflation-Linked Bonds. These bonds help to link principal and interest payments received by bond holders to the inflation rate or a measured inflation index. Basically during periods of inflation, principal or interest payments are boosted so that the value of the bond does not erode too much.

3,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 20 Feb 2019Bond prices are negatively correlated with rising inflation. Rising inflation erodes the purchasing power of cash. Therefore, investors would seek higher bond yields than they would before(at the same risk appetite levels) and would therefore most likely be unsatisfied with their current bonds, selling them off, causing prices of bonds across the board to fall.0 comments0"
