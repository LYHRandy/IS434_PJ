question,"Insurance Investments Savings Asked by Gideon LimAsked 4w agoWhat's my next step moving forward?Just met my financial consultant for a review. Had bought a few insurance policies (medical, CI, and etc) previously, so my fundamental protection is covered. Now I'm considering to do investments but I was told to consider PruWealth, the retirement/endowment fund upon sharing my current planned goals in life e.g. to buy a HDB/condo in the next 8-10 years. I do think that it is important to save up for retirement but that's not my priority or in my capacity for now. So, how should I proceed?5 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Elijah Lee, Independent Financial Advisor at Phillip Securities (Jurong East Lite)Top Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered 4w agoHi Gideon,PruWealth (actually, it's probably PruWealth II) is an open-ended endowment plan which allows you to access your cash value after premiums are paid. Some key questions you will need to consider for PruWealth (or any other insurance for that matter) areHow will the plan serve your needs?If you need to access the money in 8-10 years, are the numbers appealing enough?Are you able to fund the premiums without issue?If you don't think PruWealth fits your needs, it is okay to politely decline taking it up.Personally, if I wanted to prepare for retirement, I'd do an annuity with a private insurer to complement CPF life. What I want in retirement is a controlled stream of income for at least 15-25 years so that I have predictability in my cash flow, instead of having ready access to a large sum of money, as there is a tendency to overspend when you have ready access to funds.Hope that answers your question, if not, feel free to reply to this post if you may need further clarification.1 comment8"
2,"Eric Chia2w agoJust to add on to point 2 above, if you need the money in 10 years for your home, that money shouldn't be placed in PruWealth. Money in PruWealth is only capital guarantee after 20 years, minimum 15 years if you do annual payment on 5-year term."

Before any financial advice is provided, it's important to understand your money mindset, as well as your life situation and experiences. This would include your age and any foreseeable financial goals.
You mentioned it is not your priority or capacity? So it might be beneficial to start from there. The concept of life-centred planning is something that's big in the USA but quite new to Asia. The purpose of money is really to improve your quality of life, and it's not something you should sacrifice your daily life just to save for retirement.Getting clarity on retirement needs is important, simply because the number can be blown up to a huge number.You mentioned that your fundamental protection is covered, so based on the way you say it, I have a feeling you are fairly young, probably mid 20s or so, maybe even younger. If that's the case, I would consider skipping ANY endowment products. I believe the objective in your 60s is to have passive income that sustains your living standards. This can come from annuities, investment dividends, or even businesses.
It's hard to tell what is your tolerance to volatility, but what I would suggest is to meet a couple more financial planners to just get recommendations. Don't be afraid to meet them and walk away without buying. Guns are illegal in Singapore anyway, so don't sign anything if you don't feel it is right.HDB is a low target in Singapore. Unlike in most countries, the government actually makes it really easy for a married couple to buy. In fact, I would even say you don't really need too much financial planning to hit that goal. A condo is a different story altogether.
In a nutshell, go meet financial planners in person. Nobody can give you a piece of decent advice online.2 comments1"
4,"GLGideon Lim4w agoWhere do I find a pool of legit financial planners?Fergus Tan4w agoHonestly? Luck. I spent a good number of years helping directors and managers in the industry with their digital strategy, and I realise sometimes a lot of qualifications doesn't matter. Number of years in the industry? Good to have more, but you may meet those who already have tons of clients and only do referral biz, or they have no time to handhold. Winning awards? Again, has it's pros and cons. Same for type of company they are from. Being in a tied agency is fine, if they are able to provide products that serve your needs. Likewise, a person can be in an IFA and only focus on a few products. I think the most important 2 factors is that they must understand your needs, and their style must gel with you. The only way to solve that question is to meet up with them. If you are open to chat, I am open for coffee. You can message me on IG if that's easier for you https://www.instagram.com/fergustan/"
5,"Eric Chia, Senior Financial Consultant at PrudentialLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 2w agoHi Gideon, I'm a bit concerned when you mention that it's not in your capacity to save for retirement now since your priority is on the house coming 8 to 10 years. Quoting Seedly's graph here,You don't have to start big to start saving for retirement. The best time to start saving for retirement was yesterday.I feel that you have not fully run through the numbers with your financial consultant. How much do you really need for the house? If it's going to take up every cent of your savings, is it worth it? Best is to split your excess every month into retirement and house, so there's no need to wait until you've saved up for the house before you start saving for retirement.0 comments0"
6,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterAnswered 3w agoFor such cases, it's best to work with someone who can have a holistic view in terms of personal finance.Understand how to save on taxes, cashflow planning etc etc would be the bare minimum before people even advice on it.From the recommendation, I believe you do have some amount like at least $300 or $1000 a month, so you may wish to understand a few things basic like,What is investment meant for?(1) Cover inflation(2) Planning for retirement(3) Long term (in order to be in the positive)(4) Your mindset on risk and risk acceptance.Then can anyone advise anything. for 8 to 10 years for an HDB/condo, are you able to accept that you may not be able to cash out in the 8-10 years (because market downturn normally lasts for 3 years, an extended may last for 5 years)?If you can, it's possible to look into equities investment. But also require diversification to remove unsystematic risk. (ok going to be a wall of text soon so shall not elaborate further).0 comments0"
7,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusUpdated 4w agoA topic close to heart that I wanted to draft an article on it, as part of the things I wished could tell myself 10 years ago.You already know your goal, that's to save up for an HDB, so make it no. 1 priority. Not to say retirement is not important, but if you have to give up one of them (say you lost your job), between the HDB / retirement, which one you want to keep?Keep your priority in mind because that's what matters to you.If your priority is the HDB, put a savings goal towards it with a guesstimate of the HDB downpayment. Put a 10% on top of it for contingency (to cover for inflation and whatever). 
Do your sums to calculate the portion you could pay with CPF, and with cash and recalibrate.Next, look at your budget and consider if your savings allow you to meet both retirement and the HDB. If you could only do one, you already decided earlier. If you could somehow do both, or stretch a bit... Consider setting aside a small portion for retirement.When it comes to retirement planning, yes its good to start early, compounding is key... The key points to look out for is... When you have a cash crunch, is there a way to stop the retirement plan without penalties? Then resume later when your cash crisis is over. In your early career stage, there are so many types of possible crisis (retrenchment, marriage, unexpected baby, unexpected family emergency).Having gone thru the cycle, my personal view and adviceyou don't have to do an ILP for retirement planning. RSTU and SRS are also alternatives, and they give you tax relief. The 2nd point is CPF SA has no transaction fees.use low hanging fruit theory to optimize capital. This means prioritizing your cash to the one that gives the best payoff for the cash. In English... I would exhaust RSTU first, then SRS, then if I have still cash left, I consider alternative retirement products like annuities and other schemes. ask about the penalties for a sudden stop to contributing to the retirement plan. If the penalty is too heavy, it's not the right product. Because shit happens, and these insurance companies only care about their money and profits and don't care if you lose money when you stop/terminate the plan while you are unemployed for an extended period.if you do get into a long term retirement plan, calculate a safe amount you could do comfortably and save a bit of reserve for, so that when you do need to use your reserve to pay it, you could do so without losing the house or your family.Having seen other comments, google on the brochure and hardwarezone forum, I have bad thoughts... Especially if PruWealth is an endowment product. When it comes to endowment products, I would sayignore all these statements that assume a 4.75% return and any values you see of the surrender value. There's no guarantee you will get 4.75%, so its garbage in garbage out.endowment products probably breakeven in year 16-20 (and that is excluding interest). If you are thinking of accessing the money before year 20, this is definitely not the product for you. You will lose quite a bit of money trying to withdraw before year 20.based on my feel of endowment products I have fallen prey to before, pretty much the first 18 months of premiums are insurance and distribution costs, ie you get nothing aside from the death benefit after paying 18 months premiums, and almost zilch in surrender value.You will very likely be better off buying SSBs if your time frame of accessing the money/savings/ would-be premiums is in less than 10 years.If you haven't maxed out your CPF SA by doing RSTU, its probably the better idea (since you lose $$ taking out from the policy before 20 years... Does it make a difference vs putting into SA?).Using their PruWealth brochure, in 35 years, you will get more than 3x your premiums paid if their return is 4.75%, and that's with an ""if"". In 36 years, you might have close to 4x the RSTU contributions => using the rule of 72, at 4% interest, your RSTU contribution doubles in 18 years, with 36, it becomes 4x.
With the tax relief bonus, I think its probably more than 100% chance you end up better off. Imho.0 comments0"
