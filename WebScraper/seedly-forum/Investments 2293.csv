1,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Mar 2019Don't say 'maybe insurance'. Insurance is a must. Without insurance, how are you going to pay for your medical bills when disaster strikes? Worse still, you'd have to sell your investments to pay for the bills. This defeats the purpose of investing in the first place.Get yourself covered first, then think about investments.0 comments0"
