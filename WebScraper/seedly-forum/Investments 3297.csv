question,"Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 02 Oct 2018What should I take note of when investing in Blue Chips, and how should I chart my profits/losses?I have started investing for ~5 months, it was in the last 2 months that I had wanted to do a sheet, late start, I know.Should I jot down the costs at the start of the month, or in mid-month when actual purchase begins? (Unsure if there are any price change in between)I do not have the price information for ABF/STI at June. Are there any platforms that I can use?How should I best determine if I am having a profit/loss? Do I check by average of the number of months I have invested?4 answersAnswerBump0"

5,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 02 Oct 2018Perhaps you can start by logging in the positions you have based on purchase date, counter name and number of shares purchased on each date. Then enter a new row after each purchase is done. For information on pricing, try the sgx website?  Profit/loss wise, averaging method is ok, based on number of shares and the average price vs current price. 0 comments0"
