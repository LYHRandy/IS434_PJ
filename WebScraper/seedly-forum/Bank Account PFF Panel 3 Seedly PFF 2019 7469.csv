1,"Dawn FionaLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 03 Mar 2019Hello! They're still relevant but DBS BYOB is no longer accepting new registrants. I've kept it in the table as many of my readers signed up for it after reading my review in August 2017, and they are still getting the 2+2% on it now. Will strike it out once the 2 year period is up at the end of this year :)0 comments0"
