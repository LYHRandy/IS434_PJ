1,"Ashley Wong, Financial Assistant at Multi Management & Future SolutionsLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 06 Mar 2019Well, I agree to some extent but not completely. Children can be good investment but to put it as a greatest investment, I do not think so. Because you never know what is going to happen with your children in the near future. You may invest a lot on your children but if they fail to deliver when you expect the most from them then what will you do. Will you be ok with it? Nowadays I see a lot of children leaving their parents alone in their old age. This really makes me wonder if we should really consider children as the greatest investment.0 comments0"
