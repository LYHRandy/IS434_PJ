1,"Changzhong Zhuang, Lawyer at Eversheds Harry EliasLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019there.The two instruments you are looking at are at the safer end of the spectrum for investments. They are great picks for diversifying your investments in stocks and other more volatile instruments. Let me first address the two metrics that you have raisedCapital protection
SSBs are very safe as they are fully backed by the Singapore government. The ABF Bond ETF, while consisting of mostly AAA rated singapore government bonds, is still less secure as there are also lower rated bondsReturns
SSB has lower returns with the highest in recent times being the July 18 tranche with a 2.63% return over 10 years. In comparison ABF Bond ETF has traditionally achieved returns of up to 3.6%.Personally when I consider guaranteed returns, I usually think CPF. Even OA already nets you 2.5%,  not to mention the first 20k or even SA.But if you have a shorter investment horizon, that's the spot that SSB can fill. Your short term guaranteed returns investment. Or you can use it as your emergency savings stockpile given that it is relatively liquid; you can redeem it within a month with a nominal fee of just $2.As for ABF, it serves as a step down from SSB in capital protection, with the tradeoff being higher returns. This helps to further diversity your investments. Besides, bonds conventionally move in the opposite direction of equities, and can help you psychologically when there's a downturn. ABF tends to be a long term investment though, because it takes time for average returns to rise to a meaningful level. Hope this helps! 2 comments1"

4,"Jay Liu, Diploma in Accountancy  at KHEALevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Sep 2018SSBs. Back by the government and capital guaranteed. ABF prices movement isn't that much. 0.01~0.02 cents this past few months. So you can't really earn much in this but if you're looking at the coupons repayment only you can buy and hold. But prices may drop suddenly. Rather you just get SSBs and hold it for 10years. 0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018There is really no way to give a fanciful reply but rather then RoI figures and Margin of Safety.Even both have the term ""bond"" in it but they are totally different products.For an apple to apple compassion, fixed deposit product is the more applicable comparison to SSB.Your Principal is protected and the journey is higher capital returns when SSB is chosen with the correct time frame.0 comments0"

7,"Choon Yuan Chan, nᴉʍ oʇ dǝnᴉʇsǝd 不能说的秘密 at Tag Team with Gabriel ThamLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 16 Sep 2018I would go for SSB because of its capital protection and the fact that it is fully backed by the Singapore government. ​Returns of SSB at a 2.63% return over 10 years with full governemnt backing is a good deal as compared to ABF bond which is subjected to market volaitility0 comments0"
