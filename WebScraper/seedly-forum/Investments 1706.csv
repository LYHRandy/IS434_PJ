RookieAnswered on 09 Apr 2019Perhaps u can consider ETF rather than ILP as an investment portfolio for financial gains.Bulk of the premium paid for ILP is given to the insurance companies & agent for first 6 years which is the most crucial. On top of that there Is monthly policy fee and insurance charges to it.If investment gains are your objective, and wish to have a diversified portfolio, you should explore ETF.0 comments1"
