So it's better to sell options on stocks to gain income and aim to have the options contract expire worthless. I deploy bull put spreads for this and aim for 40% returns or more a year. However, if you are confident  in the direction of the stock, you can buy the put or call option and wait. You need to be 100% right to make money this way (in stock direction, strike price and price to pay), as there's time decay in the option price and the option price will decrease, especially when the stock price is going against your position. But when you are right, it can be possible to achieve a few hundred percent or more.Overall, selling options will allow you to achieve more consistent income and returns over the long run.0 comments1"
