1,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 23 Mar 2019Much better idea to reinvest for me (since I'm Young and I'm drawing a salary) - Reinvesting allows you to roll your interest payments into more money, and make it work harder for you. If you spend your dividends, and you initially invested $10 000, your growth will purely be from capital accumulation. Let's say the market growth is 5%, after 10 years it is (10 000)(.05)^10 = $16288.9. Asumming your dividend payouts is 2% per year, so altogether if you spend all your dividends every year you have spent $200(1.05 + 1.05^2....+1.05^10) = $2641.4 worth of dividends in 10 years. This puts you up at $16288.9 + $2641.4 = $18930.3 total net worth, assuming we don't count inflation.However, if you take this 2% per year and continue to accumulate it it is essentially making your capital gain to be 5% + 2% = 7% per year. So, after 10 years, you are looking at $10000(1.07)^10 = $19671.51. you would have gained a total of $741.21, or 3.92% more than if you would have spent all of your dividends away every year.Imagine investing 100 000, or even 1 million! 3.92% is alot of money for such huge sums, and a longer investment period would definitely increase the gap further. If you have no need for the dividends, don't spend it. Money saved is literally money earned!0 comments0"

If you are in need of money in the near future say about 6 months time, I think it would be good to save the dividends. If you are thinking of investment in the long term, reinvesting your dividends would be a better idea as this is when the power of compounding comes to play. Hope this helps!0 comments0"
3,"Good SamaritanLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 22 Mar 2019There are two types of savings account - emergency and future funds.Do you have emergency fund at your bank account? Or do you think you have enough insurance coverage? If Yes, use the money for your future fund!Future fund is your retirement money. The more money you have, less to worry when you reach that stage. Try to get a plan to enhance your future funds but with flexibility to cash out some amount when you need it. I hope this helps!0 comments0"

5,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Mar 2019It really depends on you.For me, I reinvest my dividends to take advantage of the compounding interest.However, you can also choose to save/spend it. It's just like another stream of income. You can decide what you want to do with it! :)0 comments0"
6,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Mar 2019Hi there! Reinvesting dividends allows you to reap the benefits of compounding however it is important to note some things if you were to reinvest your dividends! Firstly, dividends often fail the historic performance test, that is dividend-paying stocks historically have provided lower returns than other types of stock. Secondly, reinvesting dividends could be doing the opposite of diversification, putting your eggs in one basket.0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 22 Mar 2019If you're investing for capital growth, it's good to reinvest your dividends to have compounded returns.If you're already trying to semi retire or live off your dividends, then of course spend them.You can also use dividends to finance speculative investments as well if you're confident that your capital will continue to grow.0 comments0"
