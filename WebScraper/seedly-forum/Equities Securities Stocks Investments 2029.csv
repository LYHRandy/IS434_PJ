1,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Mar 2019Hey there!Not exactly very well versed with valuations but here are a few things you may want to look at 1) Low price/earnings (P/E) ratio Essentially, P/E ratio compares the current price of the stock with the earnings made from each share. In general, aim for stocks that have a P/E ratio of under 9. Howeer, it is good to bear in mind that standard P/E ratios can vary by industry. In some industries, the P/E may be higher than in other industries, but the stock may still be undervalued. Hence, it is important to compare the P/E ratios with companies of similar profile in that particular industry that you are looking at.2) Low Price/Book (P/B) ratio This ratio compares the current price of stocks with the book value per share of the stock.  Ratios under 1 are considered to be undervalued. Again, these ratios are meaningless on its own and should always be looked at relative to the company's competitors in the same industry.0 comments2"
2,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 25 Mar 2019P/E and P/B ratios are really good at looking at undervalued stocks. Just read in Prof Aswath Damodaran's book on a study that tracked low P/E and P/B ratios over the last few decades, which showed that stocks who possessed these indicators outperformed their peers consistently. So here you have actual empirical evidence supporting this theory! But I think you might wanna be certain also of what time frames you are looking at. The market might only ""correct"" and realise these stocks are more valuable over time, which may take quite a while.Apart from just looking at P/E and P/B, you should probably pay more attention to which companies you are comparing them against. If you compare your target company to the wrong company, then from the onset you have already made a mistake.A caveat to looking at P/E and P/B is that having a low value does not mean the stock is undervalued. A few reasons could be that(1) the target company is performing poorly, and the market recognises that these stocks are less valuable(2) higher returns are awarded for investing in these stocks because they are more risky and not because they are undervalued(3) transaction costs may be higher for these cheaper stocks so your returns may be cut(4) The lack of liqudity, trading volume and bid-ask spread may also be an issue0 comments0"
