Seedly app is not a bank account and has no authorisation to move your money.2 comments5"

What I meant was for e.g If I move $100 from a DBS account to a POSB account, of which I cannot sync at the moment, & to enter it manually. Is this possible? Or it’s not part of how the app is suppose to serveClarence Chua24 May 2019Hey Ivan, the current way is as both Johnathan and you had mentioned.

But as you had mentioned it will be a 2 entries thing. Hopeful to see the updates and making Seedly more seamless. :)"

GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi Ivan!There is a transfer function on the Seedly app that you can use to make a transfer from 1 account to another.It can be found under 'Home' - '+ Add Transaction' - 'Transfer' - 'Transfers'. To deduct $100 from your DBS account, key in $100 and press the '+/-' button at the top right to add the minus sign to make sure that it is a deduction. Then choose your DBS account, located below the row with the date functions.To add the $100 to your POSB account, choose 'Transfers' again, then key in $100. Make sure it is positive. If the minus sign is present, press the '+/-' button. Then choose your POSB account.After this, you should be able to see the change in bank account balance under the 'Accounts' tab.By using the transfer function, the $100 transfer will not affect your monthly report and not double count your expenses.Hope this helps!2 comments3"
4,"Ivan Ho23 May 2019This is the only way I found out & tried. Which also means 2 entries is a must & having to bear in mind the ‘+/-‘ at which account every time. It will be really nice to have a single entry function having able to indicate within the single entry, account 1 to account 2. The result should be a reduction & increase of each account respectively. If you know what I mean. I hope this is a possible function in the future :)Jonathan Ng23 May 2019That is a great suggestion and I have forwarded this to our products team for their perusal. Keep the feedback coming as we continually seek to improve the app for our users. 

Have a great day! :)"

Seedly app is an  Expense Tracking App You can: Sync all your banks in one place Quickly add transactions and view reports Ask / read Community Q&A, Read their daily blogs on financial or lifestyle related to financial (also available in their facebook group)Literally a mobile lightweight version of this website on the smartphone app. As it is not design to handle financial transaction, it cannot perform any $ transfer.
