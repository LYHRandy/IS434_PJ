Hopefully all these which I've written on budget weddings will help you! covers topics from budget proposal, budget wedding venues, having your dream wedding at a fraction of the price, etc. Will she be okay with a local PWS or does she want overseas shoot? Does she expect designer gowns or is she okay to rent, or even get from Taobao? all resources here:http://www.sgbudgetbabe.com/2017/04/budgetweddings.html​Proposal: does she want simple or lavish? real or lab-made diamond? fireworks? videographer to capture the moment? ​Wedding: don't forget to include and respect your respective parents' wishes as well! my husband and I had to really talk to them to compromise cos my mom insisted on a hotel banquet at first and I was like NOOOOOOOOOO! ​My biggest tip is, if it is possible for you, to go with a event venue rental + catered food. I LOVE and absolutely recommend Manna Pot for their wedding catering, they're one of the best and most affordable in the industry! ​Have fun! Don't forget this golden advice: a wedding is for a day but a marriage is for a lifetime.My husband and I decided to spend more on our marriage than our one-day wedding to impress people. And when I look back, I still think I achieved my dream wedding, even though it was quite different from the one I had envisioned it to be while growing up as a child :)​0 comments3"
