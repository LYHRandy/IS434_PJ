There would be a form to link to your bank account and setting up of CDP account.Then, you log in to your brokerage platform. Select a stock. Click trade/buy, enter the price you want to buy. You can also double check CDP account if the shares are in there. You are now a shareholder! Can attend AGM too.Once you successfully buy, you have T+3 days to ensure your broker gets money from you. If you don't provide the funds, broker will force sell. When company declare dividends, you just shake leg, few months later on the dividend payable date, you should see the money deposited into your linked bank account.0 comments0"
