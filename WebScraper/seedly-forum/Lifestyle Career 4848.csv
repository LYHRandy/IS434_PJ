question,Lifestyle Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 01 May 2019How to earn as much money as a diploma and degree holders without qualifications to my name? Which jobs to pursue? Most jobs these days need a diploma or degree like a sales job in banking need a diploma or degree. A recognized one. An internship need currently studying in polytechnic or university or an A-level graduate. Why? I don't understand and the MAS requirement of needing to be polytechnic graduate or A-level graduates to pursue a career or job in financial industry. Why is that requirement needed when retired past/older people who previously work in the financial industry have no need of it?3 answersAnswerBump0

1,"Thaddeus Tan, Community Lead at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 03 May 2019Hi Anon,to start off, I feel that is is extremely tough or even almost impossible for a person without qualifications to earn the same as a diploma/degree holder. Being in such a competitive world, people are judged/segregated based on their qualifications and achievements. The hard truth is that the world we live in focuses on qualifications and credentials... there really is no way of running away from that. Is this the right way of doing things? I don't think so, it is unfair, but no choice lor. Next time, when we have the capacity to make these decisions, hopefully we will not carry on this ""tradition"" albeit tough to do so. To sum up the whole chunk up there, I'm basically trying to say that there is a low chance you will earn as much money as a diploma and degree holders without qualifications to your name.The good news however is that it's not too late to start! The very fact that you asked this question probably means that although you might not have the necessary qualifications, you are determined to HUSTLE. GOOD JOB! I would suggest that you find your interest. There are online learning platforms such as Udemy, Upcode academy which you can learn from. You might develop an interest in cooking, flower arrangement (idk why flower arrangement) or other stuff. What I'm trying to get at here is basically, you can go for skills training and then look for a job from there. I would suggest going for skill-based jobs instead of those that need paper qualifications.I had a friend who dropped out of school as he felt that he wasn't interested in his field of study, went for private coding lessons and eventually got a job related to coding. It is possible!Paper qualifications play an important role, but it doesn't mean everything! Paper qualifications give you the headstart, gains you entry but what follows after that largely depends on your work ethic/attitude and skills that you possess. What's stopping the employer from hiring you if you have amazing skills even though you might not have paper qualifications? It's never too late to start! All the best pal! Hope this helps!0 comments1"

In other words, how could someone proof that they are as competent without any credentials.Thus, I would suggest to look at what you are good at and see how can it be visible to your potential employers. For example, tangible portfolio (creative industry) or previous track records.One of the ways to earn relatively good money is to work as auxiliary police. They probably get paid $3000-$4000. Cons: work shifts, little opportunity for progression.However, it should be a good amount to have spare cash for long term investment.1 comment0"
3,"Question Poster02 May 2019But when you have a basic skills as everyone else,o there is no way to create a portfolio and there is no track records to prove. Companies rather accept polytechnic student or A-level graduates than a no qualification person for even as intern. Is there any other way to earn relatively good money or as much as a diploma or degree holder. I don't think an auxillary police earn that much as you stated, online estimate sgd$1900-$2300? roughly a full time retail job salary. There should be ways for a person to try out for those jobs like actors audition even witho... (more)"

Back in those days maybe a degree is sufficient to get a good paying job, but now you might need an Honours degree or even a master to get the same qualification. However, it is still possible to earn higher salary. That depends on what kind of industry you'll be working in and the job experience acquire.1 comment0"
5,"Question Poster02 May 2019Can you give example like which industry and which jobs that one with lower qualification/no qualification can earn higher salary ? Traditionally, sales regardless of Industry would be easier or lenient on the educational qualification or Low/no educational qualification."
