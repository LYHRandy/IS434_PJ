This was done all the way back in 1999, where interest rates are higher compared to the current situation (Source: https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Assets/common/Documents/InterestRate.pdf). The rates are then guaranteed to protect CPF members from low interest rates.My guess is the rates will only increase when interest rates around the world goes up, as we are still in a low interest rate environment. It is unlikely to increase anytime soon as a result, and i fear that it might even decrease if the government finds that maintaining the current interest rates is not sustainable. As a benchmark, 10 year govt bonds have yields hovering around 2.0%2.5%, while 30 year bonds are hovering around 2.5%3.0% (source: https://secure.sgs.gov.sg/fdanet/BondPricesAndYields.aspx), which means there is still a significant gap in interest rates compared to CPF interest rates.0 comments2"
