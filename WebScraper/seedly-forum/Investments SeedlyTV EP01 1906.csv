1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 01 Apr 2019This is how I started 10 years ago:1. Write out my goalsWhen you write out your goals, especially quantitative financial ones + you extrapolate current salary LESS targeted expenses EQUALS savings alone (not taking into account investment returns/losses yet), you will get a sense of how long it would take to reach your goal. 2. Break it down into actionable steps Let's say, from a savings perspective, how much do you want to save a month, with your current monthly income? If so, what are items that you should cut back on? Or another example, your goal is to say, 'invest in $x in x, x, x geographies and industries', then the actionable step is to do research on the selected tickers, so that you can start monitoring and be better informed on when you want to make a position. If your goal is to buy property by age xx, then start doing your own research. Go to the place to recee, do your own research. I had the goal to buy one at 25, and I actually started looking at different properties 2 years before that. And I was literally looking at everything (from out of my budget Orchard road properties, to Geyland shophouses). I was even approached by a man who thought I was an escort of sorts, but that's a story for another day LOL.3. Communicate your goals to people whom you spend time withThis is especially important from a savings perspective. If you are looking to cut back on expenses, but the top 5 people whom you spend the most time with happen to have high SES lifestyle people who want to go to expensive restaurants and vacays dressed in ever-changing nice clothes for the gram, then its highly unlikely that you can cut back if you are expected to spend in a similar fashion all the time. However if they know your goals and are supportive, that will make your journey much easier. And who knows, you might inspire them to do the same! 4. Engage in interest groups and communities Such as Seedly and the like. This is especially so for investments, since it always helps to have an interest group that serves as a form of support. I have since achieved the goals I have set a decade ago, so I guess I gotta start setting new ones too!0 comments2"
2,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 Apr 2019I think that it's important to link back your drive to begin investing to a certain event in your life. To me, it was the point in time in my life where I had to use food stamps to collect food within my Primary school canteen because I couldn't afford to spend money on anything in the canteen. Thinking back on these kinds of events where you truly realise the power of money really pushes you to take that first step into empowering yourself in this journey. I wish that I had the power to change my fate, so I work as hard as possible to achieve that dream. I think if you have such a powerful event in your life as well, you will too!0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 31 Mar 2019Hi!Unfortunately could not be at the event but here are some tips on how to push yourself to start your financial/investing journey.1) Understand your investment objectivesEg: For myself, it is to accumulate money to graduate with as little student debt as possible/go for exchange without feeling like I'm setting myself back too much2) Assess your risk appetiteEg: How much risk are you willing to tolerate to achieve that investment objective? I certainly am not willing to lose all my money while trying to accumulate money to clear my debts (that kinda defeats the entire purpose). Your risk appetite will determine the type of investments you choose such as stocks/bonds3) Identify your investment horizonEg: The longer your investment time frame, the more you benefit from the power of compounding. Hence, that means that you could be more comfortable with a steady 2-4% YoY return for 20 years (assuming you are saving up for your child's education). On the other hand, if you may need the money within the next couple of years, your investment should be liquid.By asking yourself these questions, it forms a better picture as to how and what you need to get started! As people always say: the starting is always most difficult part but once you get started, it gets easier as you gain more experience and build on that momentum.All the best!0 comments1"
4,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 31 Mar 2019List down your goals. Pin it somewhere visible like in front of your workstation and stare at it everyday. Internalise them. You got to be hungry to want to reach your goals. Plan out the steps needed. Find a mentor to guide if needed. And most importantly, start. No matter how small a step, just start.0 comments0"
