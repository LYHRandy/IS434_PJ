There's also limited exposure, since robos have really only developed in the US. Nor is cost everything - a 3 year old can make decisions based on cost. There are still many advantages that come with fund managers or brokers that robos can't provide. 0 comments0"

Robos help you invest in etfs so you're paying for both the robos mgmt fee and the etf mgmt fee. Robos are still quite new and has no track record so people are still vary. As with every product, once it reaches a growth or maturity stage, you are likely to see more retail customers taking up this product. 0 comments0"
