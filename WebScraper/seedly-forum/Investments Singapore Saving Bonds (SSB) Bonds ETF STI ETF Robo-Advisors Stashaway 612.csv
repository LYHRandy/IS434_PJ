1,"Victor Lye, Founder & CEO at SquirrelSaveLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 30 Aug 2019The short answer is to diversify globally. We are seeing increased global uncertainty. This is the worst time to invest narrowly unless you are a trader or speculator. ETFs are relatively low-cost investments compared to unit trusts. And I would choose a Robo which invests using ETFs and diversifies globally. StashAway has been around earlier. However, SquirrelSave is new but uses machine learning AI to manage each person's portfolio 24/7. I created this after years of managing clients' monies and insurance funds. It was the best I could do until live streaming data made AI come alive. So do check out SquirrelSave and the other auto-investing choices in the market. All the best!0 comments5"

Stashaway would be good if you are looking to automate things. If you would like more hand holding session, get a trustworthy advisor and walk you through to process.0 comments1"
