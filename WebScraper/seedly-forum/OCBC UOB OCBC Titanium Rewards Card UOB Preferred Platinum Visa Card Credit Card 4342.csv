1,"YY Yin YuLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 08 Jun 2018If i were you, i would get OCBC Titanium Rewards. At the moment, there is a partnership promotion that allows you to earn up to 11 miles per dollar. Take a look at this page which explains the calculation. ​http://milelion.com/2018/04/19/ocbc-titanium-rewards-offering-6-mpd-on-mileslife/​By the way, i don't use either of the cards above, i use Citi Rewards, Ascend Amex, Maybank Horizon and DBS World Woman Card to collect miles. One card is not enough to cater for my different needs. ​0 comments0"
