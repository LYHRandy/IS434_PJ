1,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 20 Oct 2018Read an article which covers your question a few days back, check it out below.According to the article, it's because these newer universities like SUTD and SIT place a higher emphasis on internship stints (longer duration) for their students so as to allow them to apply the theoretical concepts that they have learnt on the job. Whereas NUS & NTU focuses more on theoretical knowledge as compared to the newer universities. Take a look at job advertisements and you'll notice that employers are looking to hire staff with experience and the only way for an undergraduate/graduate to gain experience is through internships. Some people can be very book smart, able to ace all of their examinations but fail to perform as well when working on their job. Currently an NSF and will be going to NTU in 2020 after I ORD.  Back in Polytechnic, I enjoyed my 6 months internship stint which I felt was very meaningful and useful where I worked as a Customer Success Engineering Intern at a start-up as not only did I manage to apply what I've learnt from lectures and tutorials on the job, I also improved my communication/networking skills through working with customers and attending networking events. I also saw how companies make use of concepts that I've learnt to help their business as compared to just working on school projects which uses certain scenarios or case study. In my case, I saw how the startup that I interned at uses AI to help boost their customers' email marketing results, grow their customer base and drive sales. https://www.todayonline.com/commentary/why-graduates-spores-newer-universities-find-it-easier-get-jobs#.W8e-HE4mREA.facebook0 comments1"
