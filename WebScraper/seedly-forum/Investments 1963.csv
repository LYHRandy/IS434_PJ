1,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019For me I started with a ETF as well - in fact it was the Nikko AM Singapore STI ETF. Was just buying it to try out the whole investing system of Standard Chartered Brokerage at the time, but have been holding and accumulating my position for about a few years now.I think for beginners, it is best to start out with something that is easy to understand and can allow you to generate moderate returns - essentially your broad market index trackers like the STI etf. I would say to try US S&P etfs also, but this is after you feel alittle more confident. You will be exposing yourself to currency exchange rate risk, so you'll have to factor in possible depreciations of the USD against the Sing dollar that might lower your returns! however, if the USD appreciates against the Sing dollar, you could potentially see even higher returns since USD are worth more now!Slowly take steps to take into account more and more risk factors - you'll be a veteran filled with various experiences of ups and downs in no time if you are serious about investing!1 comment1"

3,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi David!I started out investing in ETFs through regular savings plan offered by DBS without much knowledge of investing. Another investment that I tried out is roboadvisors since i do not need to know much as the roboadvisors are the ones doing most of the investment. If you are looking for a safer investment , SSB would be a good option since it is backed by the government. It is good to read up about the investment that you plan to do before deciding whether to invest.Hope this helps and all the best in your invesment journey!1 comment1"
