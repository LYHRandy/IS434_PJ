2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018Mm perhaps some basic understanding first. Reits pay out 90% or more of the income as distribution, typically once a quarter or every 6 months, and their borrowings cannot be more than 45%. Comprise of different sectors such as retail (shopping malls), industrial, health care (hospitals), data centres, commercial (office buildings). Depending on your preference on the sector, there's also sponsors to look at, such as capitaland, mapletree, Frasers, etc. Typical yields for reits go from 5+% to about 7+%, depending on the sector and counter chosen. Try to chasing those with high yields, as there's usually a reason to avoid them eg country and currency weakness (not all reits are based 100% based in Singapore). Do some research (lots of material out there, even on seedly blog) and decide on the counter to buy into.  To embark on your reits journey, you will need to open a brokerage account and also cdp account. Think of the latter as a bank to store your shares. Once done, you can start buying reits. You can also consider using something like maybank ke's monthly investment plan to buy a minimum of $100 worth of shares of a reit. Wide selection available. All the best in your reit journey 0 comments1"
