1,"Amanda OngLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 10 Sep 2018Hi there,​We recommend that customers spread out large investments across several months, investing through dollar-cost-averaging (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp) and holding assets until your goal is reachedBy investing a fixed dollar amount on a regular schedule, regardless of market conditions, you will purchase more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high. This ensures that you will invest at a reasonable price and exchange rate, and avoid investing at market tops, helping you to manage the risk of your investments. ​Your risk level should depend on your risk appetite and not just on returns. You can read an article we recently posted here: https://www.stashaway.sg/r/debunking-high-risk-high-return. If you would like to get a better idea on expected returns of the different portfolios or if you have any further questions, you can contact us at support@stashaway.com or +65 6248 0889 (9am - 6pm, Monday - Friday, excluding public holidays). We will be happy to help :)​Best,Amanda0 comments2"
2,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 04 Sep 2018SA will ask you a series of questions to determine your investment objective and risk profile. After the setup of the goals you can still adjust the risk profile to higher or lower.  My risk profile is the highest now and gets about 4% returns. ​Do PM me over FB so I can share with you my promo code to save 6 months fees over 10k SGD so that at least your first 10k is free of fees for first 6 months. ​So i suggest you can:1) Invest lump sum 10k using my promo code to save on fees for the first 6 months.  2) Use honest bee services and get 450 coins and redeem 50% fees for 6 months for your balance 10k and invest in lump sum on the 7th months onwards to continue to save 50% on the fees for 6 months (7th to 12th months) ​Cheers ​​​​0 comments2"
