Kyith's not my idol, but I do respect him) but like any other strong Singapore stock, there are a couple of reasons.​1) Singapore based Growth - so you can see its growth, its got high liquidity and you'll know if there are any changes. ​2) Information - There's also a ton of information available on both stocks so you can basically play nice with the rest  of the market and make money together (unless you're a genius, in which you'd just beat the crap out of everyone else through options)​3) No forex risk - because yeah.​These are actually some of the most common reasons people invest in the (ugh) STI ETF as well...but if you're looking for high returns...meh. 0 comments0"
