FreshieAnswered on 23 Jul 2019Boy, you're still youngGo for courses that shape your mindset, followed by public relations/communication, then valuable skills such as stock trading/investments and sales/business, if that interests you in the future.Use your multiple gahmen bonuses (don't be stingy) to buy books and online courses that gives you skills that can serve you well after 30s or 40s. Don't rest or be comfy. Be restless and keep learning and applying what you learnt.When you think you are oredi champion, then you're screwed!Invest in your health too. So that when you are rich in the future especially if you follow my advices, you can enjoy the fruits of your labour while you're in the pink of healthDun give excuses or ask too many questions. Seek knowledge thru coaching and mentorships and apply to gain experience. Gain feedback and improve. Rinse and repeat, until cow come home.0 comments0"

However, being a uni student myself i get that it may not be easy to juggle with school work and working part time. So if you are looking at other forms of growing your savings then i think investing would be a way for you to grow your savings.A choice of investment would be to invest in ETFs monthly which can be done through a regular savings plan. Such investments do not cost much. If i am not wrong, the minimum is $100 a month. Such investments would help to grow your savings in the long run. But of course if you can afford the time to do some part time work that would be the optimal to help to grow your savings!Hope this helps and all the best!0 comments0"
