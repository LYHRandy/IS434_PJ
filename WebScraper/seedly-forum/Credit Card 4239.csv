question,"Credit Card Asked by AnonymousAsked on 11 Dec 2018What credit card do the rich/wealthiest people in Singapore carry?I've never seen one personally, but was chatting with a friend of mine recently and he said he say someone with a shiny metal card(the ones take make the metal noise when you hit it against something hard). Read up on cards like Centurion and all too, cool stuff. Wonder how many of SG's richest carry these? Or if they just have the normal cards like everyone else to blend in.1 answerAnswerBump0"
