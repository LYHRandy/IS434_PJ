1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 27 Aug 2019Not really a resource, but I find that the best way to learn firsthand is literally to go down to condos that you are interested in, explore the neighbourhood, talk to the residents about what they are happy with and what they are not. Give yourself time to do so, especially so if you are buying it as a primary home.I probably shopped around for 2 years before I bought my first condo as an investment.2 comments2"

Many of the new launch condos are TINY, so if you're looking for something less cramped, resale condos would be a better bet. Also, you won't have to contend with a wait time of several years :)0 comments0"
