Example if you can take on debt with low interest and get higher returns from investment than the debt, you would be able to profit even more. Companies take loans to expand and so on. Its a double edge sword if not managed properly. There are also risk that your returns turn out to be lower than the debt interest which means you will continue to lose money. Good debt can help you or companies earn more and fast. Bad debt only get you to pay more and more like credit card where you pay more if you do not pay the bills on time. China rising debt situation is not a good thing though. If suddenly something happen as a whole country and a lot people cant pay their debts, it will be very bad for them. Hyflux is another example. They took debts to expand and got the tuaspring plant but in the end the plant returns are very bad compared to the debt interest rates that they borrowed from everyone.0 comments0"
