1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 20 Aug 2019Hey Zach! To answer your question simply, the main considerations here are:Cost per tradeFlexibility on entry and exit of the stockIf you were to use the BCIP or RSP from any of the banks (eg OCBC BCIP or POSB invest saver)Pros:You can set and forget (one time setup)Basically it will auto deduct on every 14th or 15th of the month that stipulated amountThis is true dollar cost averagingCons:You don't get to choose the date you want to enter (to buy the stock)The costs is really high. considering that it is 1% of every amount that you invest.If you do it on your own directly by trading via your own brokeragePros:You decide at what price you want to enterYour cost can be cheaper if you use options like cash upfront, at $10 per trade, and if you trade more than $1,000, it will already be more worth it (less than 1%)Cons:It is more tedious to setup, you will need to have your own brokerage and CDP setupYou will need to enter the market at your own time (ie trying to time the market) Hope this helps!
