God of WisdomAnswered on 03 May 2019Yes, every asset class has some place in someone's portfolio. If yo're young , you may not want so much bonds in yor portfolio because you could be looking for capital appreciation. But when your strategy becomes more conservative and you want steady income instead, bonds would fit right into what you're looking for, as they pay guaranteed coupons and provide capital protection upon maturity.0 comments0"
