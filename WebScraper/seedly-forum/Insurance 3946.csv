MasterAnswered on 25 Jan 2019I'm running a business that deals exactly with your situation.But my general advice (which is FOC), is to keep the whole life insurance until at least 70-80 years old before even considering to surrender.Unless you wish to know more (which includes understanding the exclusion list etc), then you may wish to have a non-obligation chat with me.https://www.facebook.com/Singapore-Insurance-Value-Finding-993196427536303/0 comments0"

ProdigyAnswered on 20 Jul 2018You need to see the Benefit Illustration on the guaranteed part and non-guaranteed part.​Worth it or not, whole life insurance are designed for ""whole life"" or up to XX age stated by the insurer. You need to revisit why you purchase this insurance , is it to leave a legacy behind? or for emergency situations such as death?​If you had been paying for about 7 years, the average break even point is normally 10-15 years period, but this also means you will lose those opportunity cost over the years for the funding.​Not looking into exact calculation, but most cases like yours, the ""typical"" advice will to keep it. Do speak to an advisor or someone have more knowledge to give you some 3rd/4th opinion.0 comments0"
