Now I cook better than my wife :)You can simply search for things like ""basic knife skills"" and stuff like that and learn all your fundamentals there. The Pro Home Cooks YouTube channel is great too!0 comments1"

WizardUpdated on 21 Aug 2019Haha solid man! :) I'm also a big believer in home cooked food and often cook on weekends with my girlfriend but just at home, with no cooking classes. We'd recommend:Watching Youtube videos of:Masterchef Season 10 (to get inspired)Food King on NOC (to see local food)Meatmen channel (to learn how to cook local food)Googling recipes on what you want to makeExample of home cooked Shashuka:If you are keen to go for a class, recently my company brought us on a team bonding event at CullinaryON. Really solid cooking experience for a 3 course meal, but i think it was damn pricey.If not, you can also use your skillsfuture for those classes as well which gives you a certification after 5 to 10 lessons, my gf has done it also, but on her own. Haha.0 comments0"
