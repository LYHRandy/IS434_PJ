In fact, they have increased the mirrors there over time! As a dancer myself, that's one of my favourite places to practice. Otherwise, you could check out the polytechnics. They might chase out folks who are not students though!0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 16 Jan 2019I don;t know about free, but you can check if any secondary school is willing to open up their studios after school hours or during weekends.I remember we rented a studio from my secondary school for about 5 bucks per person, and we only had 6 people. WE were there for about 2-3 hours.Then again, this happened some 10 years ago, so I can't be entirely sure of the numbers0 comments0"
