Grand MasterAnswered on 07 Jun 2019I bought car from authorised dealers as well as from parallel importers.If you want to save money, PI (parallel importer) is the way to go. Their prices is way lower than authorised dealers, and ironic enough, japanese car PI are usually engines from Japan (because they parallel imported them from Japan), while Japanese car AD are cars from Thailand or Indonesia. If you want to save money, and yet wary of being cheated by PI (every year you read cases in Straits Times of PI who went missing with deposits, or giving lousy cars), then go for the established PI.Go for those PI who are in the market for DECADES.Their prices are below AD, but above all those newer PI, because they have reputation and a better network of car servicing workshop for your warranty, so they tend to charge slightly higher than new PI1) Price = AD  Established PI  newer PI2) Service / Reputation = AD = Established PI  Newer PIjust my own experience.0 comments1"
