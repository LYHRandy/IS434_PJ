3,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Feb 2019Hi Anon,Definitely trying to ride the increase in stock price without enough research nor an exit strategy is a huge mistake - firstly, you do not understand the business model or what you are buying into (a golden rule in investing) as well as having a feeling of missing out (FOMO) of a good deal - usually by the time you hear about a good deal and many people are chiming in or searching about it, it is usually overvalued or extremely inflated in price and demand. This especially applies to high volatility stocks - take a look at pharmaceutical stocks in jan 2016, when the nasdaq biotechnological index dropped 4% while dow jones index rose by 1% - all on the back of no new news, but pure speculation. These high growth potential stocks are extremely volatile, and investors who are attracted to it's potential without considering the downside risk get burnt terribly in the worst case scenarios.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 28 Feb 2019Hello!I personally feel that people will likely pick the wrong stocks if they do not research much into the company and just buy the stocks just because their family or friends ask them too and if the people around them are all buying it. It is essential that you yourself are familiar with the company of the stock that you are buying before purchasing the stock, and not buy just because everyone around you is buying it.0 comments1"

WizardAnswered on 01 Mar 2019I think this could be a phenomenon where people just choose to follow the ""herd"" and where prices look like an upward trend, people just buy. The converse would most probably be true as well.  I think the failure here would be not actually understanding what you are buying into.Another potential troublesome phenomenon would just be letting your emotions take over you and making panic decisions. Like what others have mentioned, I think a lack of understanding and research can be more of an issue here. And if you are merely following the crowd, you tend to miss on certain opportunities also,0 comments0"
