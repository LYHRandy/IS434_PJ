As a fix to this issue:
Under the 'Accounts' tab, click on your Account or Credit Card.Click the 'Settings' button at the top right-hand corner.Select 'Delete' at the bottom to delete your account/credit card.Thereafter, choose to 'Keep Transactions'.Add your OCBC account (with your new credentials) to sync.This will allow you to refresh your connection with the new credentials, however do note that duplicate transactions may arise from this. Thereafter, you have to manually delete/ignore the duplicate transactions. :)Please let us know how it works out or if you've any questions!2 comments2"
