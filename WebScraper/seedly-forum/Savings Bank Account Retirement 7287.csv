Leave the minimum and spending amount in POSB saving account for usage.So, he can monitor how much he spend monthly. On top of that, it is easier to draw out the money from POSB bank than CIMB bank.0 comments1"
5,"Shun OhLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 08 Sep 2019Savings account with higher interest tends to need a salary crediting component.
Try looking at CIMB savings account, or even invest in SSB as a form of savings.One of the main criteria for DBS Multiplier would be the need to credit his salary.If he does not have any salary to be credited, the account will not be eligible for more interest.0 comments1"

1) Is he still getting a salary? And how much?
2) does he use credit cards? And how much?
3) does/can he invest? 
4) is he paying any bills (min 3) or through giro? Any of these questions above have a yes, you can look into...SCB BonusaverDBS MultiplierOCBC 360 AccountUOB One AccountAll these have calculators on the websites for you to calculate.
If not, or you’re looking at purely saving, you can look into CIMB Fastsaver. If I’m not wrong, Maybank has something too. Or, if the money can be locked away? If yes, can look into CIMB Fixed deposit too! 1.7% for 3 months not bad I thought!0 comments1"
