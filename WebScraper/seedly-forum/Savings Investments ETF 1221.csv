Create an emergency fund, typically would be 6-12 months of salary/expenses.Get proper insurance for protection too.After that you can consider regular investment plans which can start from as low as $100/month.0 comments1"
3,"Tan Wei MingLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 18 May 2019I saw that you recently bought an endowment plan. Please provide us with some reasons why you went into it? If you do your own research, endowment plan is something that we will always avoid... As for investing with a small sum of money, you can try dollar cost averaging with STI ETF using POSB InvestSaver or Maybank Kim Eng's monthly investment plan. The minimum commission is $1 and commission is 1% of total cost.0 comments0"
