question,"Bank Account Seedly Asked by Tan WenHaoAsked on 06 Sep 2019As DBS account can't feed info into Seedly, is there a workaround?So it's 4 months now and we know DBS ain't coming back. Is there a workaround? Like setting up a complete transfer into another bank account that can do this so that I can see my total money in and out. The hole I have from DBS makes my financial clarity rather vague except for credit card expenses. I pay rent using my DBS too. Is there a hack...like another account and I connect them up or something?1 answerAnswerBump1"
