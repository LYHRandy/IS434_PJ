Thus sudden increase of Wealth without the knowledge on how to handle, retain and grow will not sustain. Ending up fall back to the one more everyone know that don't need to learn, spend it on things that don't bring wealth growth. It also explain why we don't really see the rich spend lots of $ buying lottery for windfalls because they already know / learned how to gain wealth progressively.So the best way to gain wealth is to learn progressively so that we can retain and growth wealth further ðŸ˜„0 comments0"

2) ""I have great opportunity/business""
3) Personal poor spending and overindulgence
4) No sustainable money sources to curb their expenses
5) No planning on how to better manage their newfound wealthAll these points to the attitude towards money that killed them. Overspending basically. 0 comments0"
