Or is there some growth stock vs dividend stock element to this?Kenneth Lou17 Jan 2019Hey Adam! Yup annualised return, so both growth and dividend yield combined. Now my dividends are close to 4.5 to 5% so it's decent... need to look for better yielding stocks with incremental growth elements."

20,"See all 5 comments Daniel Lee19 Dec 2018Alternatively, you could look at getting the family plan for both and then share the costs with a couple of friends! It'll cost you cheaper per month for the subscription. That way, you don't have to kill the subscriptions!Tanyingfang Janice19 Dec 2018Heh oki! Thanks for the suggestions :) "

24,"Loh Tat Tian01 Jan 2019My view personally is, if you can beat the 2.6% of HDB loan, it's good to drag out the loan. There are some strategies which some community members have shared. They max out basic healthcare Sum and CPF SA for interest to overflow to CPF OA. This works if you are a decently high income earner. "
25,"Priscilla LongLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019For my pf resolution, I aim to further challenge myself to learn more on investment by doing more reading and attending courses next year! Seedly had been my go-to place for reading as a beginner. ‚ó°Ãà1 comment4"

28,Loh Tat Tian01 Jan 2019Stay away from having a girlfriend? You might miss out on future partner. Your wife will work with you on personal finance. It shouldn't be costing you much by having a girlfriend if she's wife material. 
29,"Guan WinsonLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 20192019 is a brand new year. In the coming year, I will try to polish my knowledge in financing either in saving or investing.

35,"Chen ZhirongLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Wow I was just planning this last night. For about 35k, including bonus, this was how I planned.Firstly, TREAT YOSELF. Gave myself a budget of about 5k for holidays and entertainment. Planning to catch the Aladdin and Matilda musical next year! Plus visit North Korea.Then, ""business expenses"" read one or two new cameras. I would really like the Fuji XT3 and maybe the 50-140mm. Or maybe get more Canons and get the 11-24mm? Need some LED lights too. Probably 5k for the lot though I might exceed.With the remaining 25k, I plan to put 15k into SRS and invest either in an annuity or stocks, depending on the market. 7k into CPF SA.  7k in my parents' OA. And keep the remaining 1k as buffer or maybe to donate?2 comments3"

37,"Beverly NgLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019In the past, my approach towards ""saving"" money is cutting down unneccessary expenses (e.g.  reduce dining out with friends, cut down on facials, try to avoid taking Grab/taxi as much as possible). Though these are good saving habits, but certaintly unsustainable in a long run as this affects the quality of my life. In 2019,  I will start to take advantage of credit card promotions or/and make dining reservation through Eatigo app to enjoy more savings without compromising meet-up with friends. When booking hotel for overseas trip, I will also book through Shopback to enjoy greater cashback savings. I will also look forward to read more on investment strategies to know how I can grow my wealth. Overall, I hope to improve my personal financial knowledge to acheive financial freedom for myself. 1 comment3"
