1,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Nov 2018Since you've graduated and starting working, it means that the interest for your student loan would've kicked in already. I'd suggest trying to clear off your student loan first so as to reduce the amount of interest payable. You can then start saving with a peace of mind! 0 comments1"

RookieAnswered on 23 Apr 2019Settle the debt the soonest you can.Saving is important as well.In order to-do both, you need to examine your finances.Set a fixed sum of money to be saved.Calculate all your FIXED monthly expenses.look at point 2 and see if you can reduce your expenses.Things like swapping starhub tv to netflix, lower the cost of your mobile plan. evaulate if you are over-paying your insurances, and little things like limiting yourself to resturant visits and eat at hawker centre, etc.Pay off the loan monthly, more is better as you can shorten the repayment period.Work with the rest of balance as other living expenses in cash.Point 5 is also important, that you try to limit the use of credit cards and use only debit card or cash. This helps to discipline your spending and give you total control.0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 27 Nov 2018Definitely prioritise your loan but also continue to set aside some money for savings since $2,000 is barely enough for an emergency should you need money.Suggest that you do up your monthly expenses and see what can be reduced or do away with.0 comments0"

Prioritise to clear your study loan to reduce the interest payable.  If you do feel safer with a bit more cash on hand, you can still work out some minimal savings of $50-$100/month while making sure apart from necessary expenses, balance money should go to repaying your debts to clear your debts ASAP so that you can have a peace of mind.0 comments0"
