ProdigyAnswered on 07 Jul 2019For most banks, there are other terms and condition such as min saving amount with their bank etc. I suppose they are encouraging you to save and spend your money through them.For debit card, the amount is deducted straight from your bank account whereas for credit card, there is a credit limit. In case of fraud, lesser amount of money is subjected to risk. (In both situations, you can get back your money but it would be more troublesome for debit card due to the amount involved and your money is alr gone from your bank)Credit card is good for building your credit history and credit score (provided you pay your bills on time). Itâ€™s good especially if you plan on taking loans (house loan or car loan) in future.0 comments0"
