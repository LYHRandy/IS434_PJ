1,"Eric LohLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 03 Sep 2019Take up another job first and in the meantime, do a part-time degree course (financed by the job) on data analytics if you like. There are also a lot of paid/free online courses out there for you to learn technical skills for data analytics (perhaps you can try Udemy which offers online courses at affordable prices) then look for the opportunity to switch your career or apply for an internal transfer in the same company to the relevant department once you have mastered the necessary skills.1 comment1"
