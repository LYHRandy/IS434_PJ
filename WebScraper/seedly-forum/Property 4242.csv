WonderkidAnswered on 22 Aug 2019It is advisable unless staying with your parents is detrimental to your mental health :)BTO can take up to 3-4 years to build and in the meantime you can save up.If you were to rent a place, the rentals over 3-4 years can be substantial and could have gone into paying for your BTO renovation.0 comments1"
