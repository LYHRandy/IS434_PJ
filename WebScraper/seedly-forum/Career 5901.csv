question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 27 Nov 2018Wanting to grow in career but also looking to start family soon. How?Am looking to start a family in about 3-4 months time, however am also not sure whether to look for a new job. Feel like I'm not growing much at my current company in terms of pay but boss promised a promotion at the end of the year. Should I leave for greener pastures (but potentially longer working hours since it's a new company, and the new company might not be family oriented) or stay in the current one (where I have relatively comfortable work hours and a good of annual leaves)?3 answersAnswerBump1"

Even you have sufficient funds for the future (emergency + child expenses and everything), I think you should start thinking about changing job after your child has settled down. It'll be additional amount of unnecessary stress on both yourself and your spouse during the period. 0 comments1"
