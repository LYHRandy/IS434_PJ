1,"EEvelynLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 16 Aug 2019It can mean a lot of things. 1) since you mentioned you always make mistakes, take the initiative after you realise you make the mistake, ask the person what kinda mistake you’ve made and how you can correct or avoid it in the future. Be more receptive to feedback and willing to change. You might not like the feedback, take it with a pinch of salt, take the constructive ones and throw away the criticising portions out. 
2) ask yourself how can YOU improve the existing system you’re working in, I am stressing the “YOU” as yourself, I’m not saying you have to overhaul the whole company of course. Maybe you wanna look into small things like making things work more efficiently. Something that is within your control and abilities. Wanted to write more but I think these two are already a lot to accomplish. Maybe you want to look into these two first.0 comments2"

3,"AAAmi AtmLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 18 Aug 2019I can share with you something I recently applied.It works better for me than a to-do list.Every day, I look for these few things end of the day: (3)Big wins (I arrive office early or I finish a task before boss ask me or I give thanks or compliments to my colleague)
At the start, it will be difficult but after 1 or 2 days your mind will focus on winning or solution rather than mistakes. (3) area of improvements 
This point learn to let go of my mistakes today and feeling of progress because I can always change (1) big asset of yours 
May be youth or willing to improve (1) big liabilities  - may be inexperience Best emotion today Worst emotion today Best habit Worst habit It seems to work for me even a decade of employment, I appreciate more what I have and always in check of what I can do better for improvement. Feeling of achievement and progress while focusing on the present moment. 0 comments0"
