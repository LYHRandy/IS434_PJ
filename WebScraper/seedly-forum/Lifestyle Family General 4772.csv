1,"Jennifer GohLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 18 Jul 2019If you’re not very close to the person like a distant relative/colleague, give $10-$20 (give an odd number amount because odd numbers are associated with inauspicious events eg. funerals). If you’re quite close to the person $50-$80 will be acceptable.Hope the above helps a little! :)1 comment1"
2,"Fan ZD18 Jul 2019@Jennifer, what do you mean by giving odd number amount? The numbers you listed are even. Anyways just to add on a little. From my understanding, bosses typically give $100-$200 in white gold."
