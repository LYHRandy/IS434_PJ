1,"Dhruv Arora, Founder & Chief Executive Officer at SyfeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 5. GeniusAnswered on 17 Sep 2019Hello there! Perhaps I could share more about Syfe's investment methodology to help you make a better choice.Our key strength lies in our proprietary Automated Risk-managed Investments (ARI) methodology. ARI combines two of the worldâ€™s leading investment approaches and is built by a team of academics, technologists and former bankers.ARI creates your portfolio by allocating assets which have shown the best return for your risk profile. But more importantly, it continually monitors your portfolio. During periods where higher market volatility has been forecasted, ARI will adjust your portfolio allocation and reduce your exposure to higher-risk asset classes. This ensures your portfolio risk stays aligned to your desired risk level.During periods of market calm, ARI will adjust your portfolio allocation to include higher-risk assets so your overall portfolio risk is kept in line with your desired risk exposure but you get to capture the market upside as well. The result is that ARI helps you achieve benchmark-beating returns by maintaining your desired risk level, no matter what market conditions may be.Another point to highlight would be our simple, all-inclusive fee of 0.65% per annum. We have no minimum investment amount and you always have the freedom to withdraw anytime at no extra charge.0 comments5"

WizardAnswered on 16 Sep 2019I am assuming your Invest Saver is investing only in STI ETF and ABF Bond ETF.Then, in this case, a globally diversified ETF portfolio from StashAway and Syfe, with rebalancing and Dollar cost averaging would probably yield better returns.0 comments2"
