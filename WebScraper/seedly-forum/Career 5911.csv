2,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Nov 2018""...it is doubtful that such a certification carries much value in the eyes of senior management.  For example, how many “certified quality engineers” currently hold top positions in a corporation?  Do business executives view such a certification as a leadership credential? "" https://www.isixsigma.com/ask-dr-mikel-harry/ask-certification-training/what-are-job-prospects-if-i-only-have-six-sigma-training-and-not-certification-what-does-cssbb-exam-entail/Lean Six Sigma can be applied to: Marketing / Sales, Design, Production, HR, Maintenance, Supply Chain, General Management, Customer Service where there is room for reduction of 'waste'. The certificate itself isnt worth much, worth comes when you are able to apply the concepts taught into real life. I guess it's not stated cuz it's more suited for engineering and manufacturing sectors.0 comments1"
