1,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Mar 2019Check their default rates, though the definition of default may be different from platform to platform. I currently use Funding societies, and theirs is at about less than 1%? However, they do have late invoice payments though, you have to not panic when that happens. very often you will get your principal back. I think we should always check the way they go about evaluating their potential listees. From what I know, FS is pretty rigourous, so you should not be exposed to too much risk in terms of defaults! but of course, each loan has their own risk, you will need to check the company credentials and performance reports which are usually available on the p2p platforms for you to do an analysis before investing.0 comments3"
2,"Getty Goh, Co-Founder & Exec Chairman at Coassets LtdLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 14 Mar 2019Hey there,I’m Getty and I’m the CEO of CoAssets - an ASX listed fintech company that offers online funding. This is a topic that is very close to my heart, so let me share my thoughts.As much as I may sound like I’m shooting myself in the foot (as a platform operator), my humble view is that P2P platforms face a wide variety of risks. It is precisely due to these inherent risks, which necessitates the regulation of P2P in many jurisdictions.So what are some of the risks surrounding P2P platforms?First is risks surrounding the projects that are listed on the P2P platforms. This has been covered in other posts, so I will not talk too much about it. However, I would like to share some of my thoughts on invoice financing.When it comes to invoice financing, some investors go with the assumption that all (if not most) corporations will pay their invoices on time. In reality, this is not quite the case. Based on a Singapore Corporate Credit Bureau (SCCB) report, the percentage of slow and partial payments in 2018Q3 are 38.94% and 12.74% respectively. Prompt payment only makes up of 48.31% of payables due. (Source: https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/payment-delays-by-singapore-firms-up-for-second-straight-quarter-in-q3). According to this data, it would mean that some investors may face the risk of a delayed or partial repayment for the invoice financing deals they get themselves into.Admittedly, this is a sector that I am not too familiar with and there are platforms in the market that are able to consistently identify good invoice financing deals. It it not to say that investors cannot make good returns from invoice financing type deals - however this is probably one risk that investors of invoice financing P2P platforms face.Putting things in the right perspective, the margin for P2P is quite competitive (most service fees are between 1% and 5%). This means that platforms that ONLY provides P2P service and unable to grow fast enough, may face considerable cost pressures. To illustrate, if a platform’s annual expense is $1.2m (which works out to be about $100k a month), the amount of deals they will have to successfully fund each year would be between $24m (if the service fee is 5%) and $120m (if the service fee is 1%). Assuming the average value of each deal is $50k, even if we use the lower end of the funding target (i.e. $24m), the number of deals that the platform will have to successfully serve is 480. At, say, a hypothetical successful deal conversion rate of 10% (side note: it is IMPOSSIBLE to find and fund 100% of the deals 100% of the time), the number of deals a platform would need to find and qualify would be in excess of 4,800. These are big numbers for most start-up P2P platforms to achieve, in their quest to be financially sustainable.At the end of the day, unless they are listed and/or make their audited accounts public, it will be quite hard to say how platforms are doing financially. In addition, most SMEs that have a revenue of less than $10m will not have to be audited - so there is really no way to tell how well many of these P2P platforms do (in terms of financially). Hence, unless they have access to VC funding, financial viability would be one key risk that most P2P platforms face.So there you have it! These points are not exhaustive and I’m sure there are definitely other risks that have not been highlighted. However, I hope that these would provide some “food for thought” for potential investors to think about.0 comments3"
3,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 14 Mar 2019I used to work in Minterest, one of the p2p platforms, and know that their due dilligence and rigour in evaluating businesses is very high. We were a really small team, but it was a very good experience working there and with other businesses who needed financing. I know the co-founders personally, and for them, it's really quality over quantity. They won't take on deals they know is risky. On the other hand, while doing competitor analysis, there are some platforms out there (don't want to name who), who took on deals that were risky and experienced very high default rates. So I am confident that Minterest is a very safe platform to invest in compared to the rest.Something that you might want to look out for is also how default rates are defined. Different platforms may define it differently and play fast and loose with the term. So it could help if you do your own analysis on the platform too!0 comments1"
4,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Mar 2019Not very sure if this applies to all p2p lending platform in Singapore but from what i know, Funding Societies is backed by MAS.Also, default rates on loans in most platforms are ~1%, coupled with the fact that your investments in loans on p2p platforms are usually capped.In short, its pretty safe!0 comments1"
