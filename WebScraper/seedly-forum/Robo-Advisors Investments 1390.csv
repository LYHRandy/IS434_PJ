question,"Robo-Advisors Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 07 May 2019Why is MoneyOwl seemingly trying to upsell themselves so much here. It feels like im getting a one sided sale pitch from a company rather than an objective views of different robo-advisors? Or would it be possible for Seedly to 'influence' the other representatives from other robo-advisors to make their claims. But then this entire thing might turn into a pitch sale. disclaimer: I love moneyowl involvement in this space and like their sharing of knowledge. But with almost every question tagged robo-advisor answered by only them, its kinda one sided imo. Or am i the only sensitive one here2 answersAnswerBump2"

I answered as many question as possible for MoneyOwl because I thought this was part of the """"must do"" activities leading up to the event. I didn't expect us to be the only one answering. So sorry you felt that we were trying to upsell  too much but we hope that some of my answers are of some ways beneficial for you.2 comments3"
