question,"Credit Card Shopping Asked by AnonymousAsked on 01 Jan 2019Best payment method for online shopping? Credit card or MCA debit card, youtrip?I'm a frequent taobao shopper, and have been just using POSB everyday card because it is the only one I have. Never really thought to consider the transaction fees. I also pay for my air tickets, hotels, airbnbs with the same card. What payment is best for such transactions? While I don't spend thousands upon thousands, I'd rather not be losing bits of money here and there if I can. Then again, not sure about convenience vs that small bit of money (e.g. youtrip like a bit troublesome)1 answerAnswerBump0"

We did some comparison on different MCA accounts and YouTrip previously. You can have a look to see which suit your usage best.0 comments0"
