1,"Clarence Chua, Financial Planning Specialist at Prudential Assurance SingaporeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterAnswered on 26 Jul 2019Firstly get your insurances settled first. Wealth protection should always be the first step of building a good portfolio. Too many people are overly eager to grow their wealth, only to lose it to death and illnesses when they strike. A really basic and simple guideline to how you can manage your money is. Keep your expenses to below 50%. Then set aside 20% for savings, you may put them into different instruments. Set aside another 10-20% for investments. Set aside 5% to get books for self improvement. Also remember to start building your emergency fund. (6 months of income) And maintain a healthy cashflow!0 comments4"
2,"Joke JongLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 16 Jul 2019What i did for myself when I was at that state of my life was to:make sure I have adequate insurance coverage using term insurance so that if something happens to me, I am not a burden to my family and community. I need to be able to get cash easily and quickly. After deciding what I can save a month, I will setup 70% of my savings in a short term plan and another 30% in a longer term plan.For the short term plan, it could be a fixed deposit or a SGS bond whenever I have accumulated a sum of $1000. for the long term plan, I will accumulate about $1500, then buy ETF (Straits times index fund). i am not sure what kind of liquidity moneyowl investment and savings plan offer. if it provides the returns you are expecting and itâ€™s easy to retrieve money when you need it for wedding, and house Reno next time, then Yeap, stay with it. :)0 comments1"

FreshieAnswered on 23 Jul 2019Boy, you're still young Go for courses that shape your mindset, followed by public relations/communication, then valuable skills such as stock trading/investments and sales/business, if that interests you in the future.Use your multiple gahmen bonuses (don't be stingy) to buy books and online courses that gives you skills that can serve you well after 30s or 40s. Don't rest or be comfy. Be restless and keep learning and applying what you learnt.When you think you are oredi champion, then you're screwed!Invest in your health too. So that when you are rich in the future especially if you follow my advices, you can enjoy the fruits of your labour while you're in the pink of healthDun give excuses or ask too many questions. Seek knowledge thru coaching and mentorships and apply to gain experience. Gain feedback and improve. Rinse and repeat, until cow come home.0 comments0"
