If you are under F-1 visa, you're allowed on-campus employment:Associated with the school's established curriculumRelated to contractually-funded research projects at the post-graduate levelAlways check whether it is an 'on-campus employment'. It is the employee's responsibility.As F1 student, 'off-campus employment' is not allowed unless authorised by the DSO.
