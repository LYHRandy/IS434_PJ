WizardAnswered on 29 Aug 2019I would say YouTrip can be a good option for you to consider?If you are spending for a few weeks, not months.Because the banks FX rates are really horrendous. Recently I went to China and used my OCBC card to transact. What happened was that the exchange rate was $20 more than if I would have used YouTrip #TrueStory.So staying there a few months, you can either use YouTrip or choose to use a local card to transact in local HKD currency instead rather than in SGD (because you would be eaten up by the bank FX rates for sure!)0 comments1"
