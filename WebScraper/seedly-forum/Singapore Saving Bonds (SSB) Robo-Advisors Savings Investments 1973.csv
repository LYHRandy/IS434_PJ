Savings and investments are seperate.Investing in roboadvisor at lowest settings cannot be used as savings. There might still be downsides even though the lowest risk setting reduces volatility and focus on capital preservation.For savings you need peace of mind that the money will never face a downside. You can accomplish that with Singapore savings bonds.0 comments0"
