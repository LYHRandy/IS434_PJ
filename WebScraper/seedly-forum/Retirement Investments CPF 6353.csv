God of WisdomAnswered on 27 Oct 2018You can only do a voluntary contribution to your SA up to the FRS of the current year. This year's its 171k. Then it can only earn interest. Same with MA. Any new monies trying to enter MA will flow to SA, and if that is full, will flow to OA. OA has no cap but only earns 2.5%. 0 comments0"
