1,"Sarah Chan, Business Administration at NUSLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi anon!Hope this answer didn't come too late. Current NUS student here anyway!! My answer won't be focused on promoting NUS over NTU, but rather i think these are the following points you should think through:Do you really wanna do DDP or are you alright with say, a minor in business instead? Or taking business modules as unrestricted electives (UEs) instead?If you cannot stay in hall for all 4 years (or more, depending if you extend) in uni, are you alright with traveling to & fro whichever uni you decide on?After doing your preliminary research into what modules you can expect at both NUS & NTU's Computing, which of them suits you better? Or at least piques your interest?Ultimately, you should ask yourself if a) having that extra degree in business is really crucial for yourself, or can you live with taking business modules as UEs instead & b) which uni's computing curriculum do you prefer/think you can thrive in?Finally, speak to seniors from both NUS & NTU Computing! Directly ask them what are the cons of studying in their course in their uni, don't focus on the pros (we can easily google them out). Ask yourself if you're alright with them and can live through 4 years of that.Hopefully this is helpful and I wasn't too late! All the best in your future endeavours in uni :-)1 comment2"

Indeed, a very important question."
