1,"YY Yin YuLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 07 Jun 2018Usual Unlimited Cashback card offers 1.5% with no minimum spend requirement. However, if the amount is >S$2000, can consider HSBC Advance Card which offers 2.5% (cap at S$2,800).However, if the salon can accept Apple Pay, can use CITIbank Rewards card, 20x per dollar. This is the best at the moment. â€‹0 comments3"
