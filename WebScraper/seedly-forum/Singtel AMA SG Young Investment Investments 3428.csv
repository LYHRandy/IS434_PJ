question,"Singtel AMA SG Young Investment Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 11 Sep 2018What is your take on SingTel stock (SGX: Z74) as a blue-chip?Seems to be a really tough ride. My family has quite a fair chunk of our assets in blue chip stocks, one of them being the SingTel stock. And being a fellow blue-chip investor, I'm wondering whether the fundamentals of this stock has changed and whether it is a bargain now (at 5 year low for over the past few months) or is it going down hill, one to avoid and cut-loss?1 answerAnswerBump0"
