God of WisdomAnswered on 15 Aug 2019The general rule of thumb would be 10 X Annual Income in the event of Death and 5 X Annual Income in the event of a Critical Illness.So if you make 100k a year, that's 1m and 500k respectively.
This is a guideline and would change slightly from family to family. So do speak with a financial advisor to run the numbers if you want a deeper look, but if not the rules of thumb work well enough.0 comments2"
