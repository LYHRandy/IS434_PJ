1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 18 Mar 2019Importantly, free cashflow to the firm also nets the effects of capital expenditures, which operating cashflows don't take into account. Free cashflow is usually used for valuation, while operating cashflows are not. Free cashflow to the firm can takes into account broader business cycles and development of the company, since capital expenditures are usually a big part of the business. Operating cashflow takes into account what happens to the company on a regular operating basis.0 comments1"
