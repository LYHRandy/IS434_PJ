The REP allows you to retain your permanent residence while you are outside Singapore. If you leave Singapore or remain overseas without a valid REP, you will lose your permanent residence. I doubt that you can continue to contribute to your CPF account then.From there on, you can apply to withdraw your CPF sum. If your application to withdraw CPF is approved and you are covered under the CPF LIFE Standard or Basic Plan, you will be given two options:Terminate your LIFE policy and receive a refund of the unused premium. Retain your LIFE policy under the CPF LIFE Scheme, and you can start receiving monthly payouts from your  payout eligibility age for as long as you live. You will need to have a Singapore personal /joint bank account for us to credit your monthly payouts.0 comments1"
