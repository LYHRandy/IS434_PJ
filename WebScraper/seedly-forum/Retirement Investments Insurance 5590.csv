God of WisdomAnswered on 03 Nov 2018Hey Anon, since retirement is about 35 years away, you should look to invest into a globally diversified portfolio if you want something passive, or learn investing yourself if you want something active and save on costs.However one thing I would like to say is that when you're single and without kids, you should try and save at least 50-60% of your income. If this is an issue, I suggest you look into your expenses and try to trim things down. 0 comments0"
