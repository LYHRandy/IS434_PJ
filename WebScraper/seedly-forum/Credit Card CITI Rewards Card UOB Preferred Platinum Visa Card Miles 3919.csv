question,"Credit Card CITI Rewards Card UOB Preferred Platinum Visa Card Miles Asked by AnonymousAsked on 15 Jul 2019Citi Rewards Card vs UOB Platinum Preferred Card?I largely spend on Grab, GrabFood, Shopee, Zalora and dining out. I spend about $300-500/month on the mentioned platforms. Both cards seem to do pretty well! UOB has the $5 blocks which I'm not sure if it affects much, although I'm unsure about the Citi eligible spending categories. Does it include all those that I mentioned? Also, are there any other cards to consider for miles?2 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered 3w agoThis sounds like a very late reply now but based on the categories you mentioned, I would choose Citi. The $5 block for UOB will make calculations a little bit tricky so I would avoid that.For Grab, these 2 cards don't give points. Citi is a hit and miss so it depends.Better miles card for your mentioned categories:Grab: Maybank Horizon Visa and AMEX Krisflyer cardDining Out: Maybank Horizon Visa.Refer to this for more information:  https://milelion.com/credit-cards/guide/0 comments1"
