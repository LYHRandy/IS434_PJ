WonderkidAnswered on 26 May 2019Hi Ivy, Douglas here. 2nd Keynote speaker.Yes the downpayment is heavy for the 2nd since you can take only up to 55% loan for your second residential property.You will have to look at the commercial and industrial sector where u can take a higher loan quantum as long as you clear the TDSR as an individual buyer.​​​
You can always connect with me via https://www.facebook.com/douglas.chow.908 or simply whatsapp/sms my company 24/7 hotline @83324283
Remember, plan your finances properly, don’t overstretch, do your homework and enjoy your property investment journey.
