It shows a growing economy. But too much is bad, shows a lack of fiscal policy and deflation (or negative inflation) is bad too, shows that the economy is slowing down and people get worried that companies and countries aren't making enough profits. They might lose their jobs, foreign investments pull out, etc.0 comments0"
