question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 27 Nov 2018I'm 21 Diploma holder, I work at a job that pays me 2,100 which is pretty good, but I detest. The career I want will mean a pay cut of $300, how can I balance interest and income practicality?Working in the job I like will mean up to 6 months of low paying internships and unstable work for the next 2 years, but I can't help but think it could make me happy. My family is quite disapproving of me moving away from my current stable, banking job though.5 answersAnswerBump0"

MasterAnswered on 27 Nov 2018Do you have enough money for any unforeseen circumstances or any big ticket items that may come along? if you do then stay at your current job first till you have accumulated enough. When you have sufficient you can transit over. I believe if you have the right motivation, higher salary wouldn’t be a problem in a few years. 0 comments2"

If you like the new career and you are good at it, making up the $300 should be relatively easy and potentially the upside is larger0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 27 Nov 2018My personal view is nevee take a pay cut when moving jobs because it takes a long time to climb up again.on The flip side since you are young with little or no commitments I would say why not ? take a leap of faith and if it doesn’t work out find another job.0 comments0"
