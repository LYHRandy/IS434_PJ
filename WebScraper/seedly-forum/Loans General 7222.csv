WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Yeah agree kah hwee, can just tell him nicely that you cannot afford to lend the $ now as you need it for whatever reasons or gf / wife not allow.​If he don't wanna be your friend because you don't lend him $, then he is not your friend. He's just treating you like a free cash machine only. Such not worth to be friends.​True friends will borrow $ and return in time.True friends will understand if you can't lend him $, you have your reason.So keep true friends and let the fake friends go.2 comments2"
