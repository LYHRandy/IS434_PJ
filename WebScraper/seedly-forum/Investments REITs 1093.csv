question,Investments REITs Asked by AnonymousAsked on 28 May 2019Should I buy Parkway Life REIT now? Been watching the price since Dec last year (but missed the opportunity to buy). Now i'm afraid that the price will just go and i'll regret it. I'm aware that Parkway Life REIT is overvalued now. Any thoughts and opinions on this? I'm still a beginner at investing.3 answersAnswerBump2

1,"Tracy LimLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 29 May 2019Agree with Gabriel. When I wrote this article, it was $2.86, now it's $3.00! Personally wouldn't go in now. Almost at the 52 week high.0 comments3"

ProdigyAnswered on 29 May 2019To me it’s a buy, if you look at its price trajectory throughout 2018, it was a collapse in the 1H (likely ignited by fears of further US interest rates hikes) followed by a gradual recovery in the 2H. But the financial & operating fundamentals for Parkway Life reit still remain strong and unchanged with dividends consistently increasing for 2018. Hence, theoretically speaking its share price for 2018 should actually be better than 2017, however that did not happen in hindsight. My personal opinion, it should have more legs to climb, in order to catch up with the step back it took during 2018. Further more, there will be some investors shunning from more riskier equities to more defensive stocks in light of the US-China trade tensions. The yield looked compressed now because it’s using the current dividend. As a long-term investor you had to look at the forward dividends and subsequent yield-of-cost. Just take a small position first, and monitor whether your want to buy more on the dip should it correct.0 comments1"

But if you are afraid of missing out, can consider to buy a small amount. When it drops alot, you buy more. This way you won't keep thinking about missing out.0 comments1"
