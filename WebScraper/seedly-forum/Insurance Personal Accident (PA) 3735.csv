1,"Eric Chia, Senior Financial Consultant at PrudentialLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 26 Jul 2019Most accident plans in the market are guaranteed issuance, I.e. you can buy with disabilities. However, there's no insurance payout on your existing disabilities and disabilities due to pre-existing medical conditions.What this means is claims can be made from personal accident plan if the disability happens due to an accident that occurs after the plan is purchased.1 comment1"
