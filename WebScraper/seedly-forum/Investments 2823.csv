Look into reits for stable dividend payouts. On the other hand, UTs will be subject to many fees, including but not limited to bid offer spread, management fees, platform fees and if you are buying through an insurer, admin and policy fees. How much do you think these fees will erode into long term profits? Oh, and dividends paid out are from NAV so price will drop. Avoid like the plague0 comments1"
