Grand MasterAnswered on 24 May 2019Hey June, there is no best time to enter the market, profits can be made in both a bear and bull trend. The strategies and execution are different for sure.Donâ€™t try to time the market when it comes to your investment. Stick to your investment horizon and portfolio strategy, review it regularly and update as required.Make sure your portfolio is always in your risk profile range and stay invested. If you had went in the market at one of the highest point before a crash but stay invested for a good 20 years (with proper portfolio management) chances are you will still end up being in the green.There will always be opportunities to buy an asset at a great value in most times. :)0 comments3"
