There's the chance of losing quite a fair bit of your portfolio if you are not careful. For low risk instruments, you can look into bonds like the Singapore savings bonds or the abf Singapore bond index fund which you can dca into via posb. Back to your query, firstly you will need a cdp account to hold your stock purchases. Unless you are using a custodian account where a financial institution holds the stock for you. As you are new to investing, do take some time to read up on investment books first to get a better understanding. Maybe you can also consider buying into a stock or the STI ETF on a monthly basis for a start. You can do this via posb's invest saver or maybank ke's monthly investment plan. Or start a portfolio with a robo advisory like stashaway. Whatever you do, don't walk into a bank and say you want to open a trading account. You may be whisked to a side and be talked into signing up for an endowment or ilp or annuity plan instead. Which is not what you wanna get into, as a large portion of what you are paying goes to the commissions and the bank / insurer. Hope this helps 0 comments0"
