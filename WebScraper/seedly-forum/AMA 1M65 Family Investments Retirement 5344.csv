1,"Loo Cheng Chuan, Founder at 1M65 MovementLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019This is a very good and profound question. Never had anyone asked me this question in all my talks and online feedback. I think retirement means having the freedom to do what you want without any worries of money. At 43, I stepped down from my corporate life and start a business. Fortunately, I need not worry about money, living expensives or business funding.  Strangely, my ""retirement"" life is more active than my corporate life.  I become an entreprenuer which i was very passionate about. Also an investor and mentor to a few startups, and most importanly, start 1M65 movement and actively promoting 1M65 with many talks and writings.  These are work that I really enjoy.  So my retired life is more ""siong"" than my corporate life and the passion and joy of doing things that I life keep my adrenalin going everyday. 1 comment5"
