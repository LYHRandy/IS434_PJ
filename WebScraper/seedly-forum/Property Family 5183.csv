1,"Meiling TanLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 17 Sep 2019I like Hariz's short and simple answer, but given that you are fresh grads, I'd also like to point out a few extra details:Since you're buying a condo, you'll need to have at least 20% (ideally 25%) of the 700k purchase price saved up for the downpayment. 5% ($35k) must be in cash, and the rest can come out of your CPF OA. I don't know how much savings you have, but hopefully you've got enough (or can borrow from relatives!)Don't forget the costs of renovations, legal conveyancing, furniture, and so on. Most of these also require cash upfront. You can take out other loans to cover these, but that's assuming your home loan doesn't take up the entirety of your 60% TDSR limit.This costing guide has a full rundown of all the bills you can expect along the way, so you can make more detailed calculations.Best of luck with your new home purchase! :)2 comments6"
2,"Kenneth Lou17 Sep 2019This is a good answer! Thanks Meiling! :)Siow Nan17 Sep 2019You will need more than 25% for downpayment actually with the revised rules, plus bsd and legal fees to add in. Also need to account for future cash flow and maintenance fees."

God of WisdomAnswered on 12 Sep 2019You both make just under 110k/yr.The rule of thumb on home affordability is between 5-7 X Combined Annual income. In this case, you can afford a 550k-770k home.So yes, you should be able to afford your intended home purchase should you continue being employed.0 comments6"
4,"Billy OngLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 17 Sep 2019This is a breakdown in cost if you are looking at a new launch at $700k.25% Downpayment 
(5%: $35,000 Cash)
(20%: $140,000 Cash/CPF)Buyer Stamp Duty
($15,600)Legal Fee
($3000)Total Cash outlay: $193,600Assuming loan tenure is 30 years at 2.5%, you will be loaning $525,000 at $2,074 every month. Since you mention that you only have $50,000 in your OA, you need to have cash of $125,000 for remaining cash outlay. Oh yes, add in your property tax and maintenance fee. Does it still seem feasible?3 comments3"

Grand MasterAnswered on 24 Sep 2019Yes, this is within your affordable range.Do include these for considerationsPotential pay rise in the futurepotential pay drop? Especially if you guys decide to have a SAHM (stay at home mom or stay at home dad)increase in interest rate, that makes mortgage payment higher.Do note that condo has a higher maintenance bill (MCST) compared to HDB (town council fees). You pay higher property taxes, higher parking fees (for some condos). You also don't enjoy fee rebates on town council fees during the yearly budget.0 comments0"
7,"Kenneth ChanLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 18 Sep 2019The general rule of the thumb (according to Dave Ramsey) is:Not more than 15 years of loan.Not more than 25% of your income to pay the mortgage loan.Assuming a $525k loan with 2% interest, your monthly repayment of about $2k is about 27% of your combined income of $7.3k, so you should be fine. Just note the $175k downpayment and you will be fine.0 comments0"
8,"YY Yin YuLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 17 Sep 2019If the downpayment (the major struggle to most people) is not an issue, surely you can afford at the initial stage. But I would Budget 30% cash plus CPF. I just want to add one more point, that’s about the monthly loan Installment. 23% of your combined income will go to OA which will be used to pay the instalment, that’s only $1679. Hence, you need to top up the difference in cash of at least $400 to $1000 depending on the loan tenure and amount. On top of that, there is a monthly maintenance fee.
I kepo a bit to highlight this. If you forgo the chance to get the HDB flat first, it will be much harder for you both to get the housing grant offered by the government when getting HDB later (if you both are not SC or don’t intend to own any HDB later, then you can ignore this).
Good luck with your house hunting!0 comments0"

First, your downpayment is a problem.1 comment0"
10,"Peko Peko17 Sep 2019You didn’t mention your motivation for getting a condo. Have you considered that:

1) for 700k, what location/size could you get? Likely somewhere really far out like CCK/woodlands etc and just barely enough for 2 adults+1(?)kid in terms of size. For the same price you could possibly get a much nicer location for HDB and larger flat size
