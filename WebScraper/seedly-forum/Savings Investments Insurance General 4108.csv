MasterAnswered on 29 Aug 2018If you are already contributing 500 per month into STI, perhaps, u can use this opportunity to bolster your savings as per what Gabriel suggested.

2,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 29 Aug 2018Hi, you can consider opening a POSB Save As You Earn (SAYE) account and contribute $100 into that account monthly. If you do not make any withdrawals for 2 years, you'll be able to earn an additional 2% interest in that account. I feel that it is a great way to kick start your savings with your NS salary. https://www.posb.com.sg/personal/landing/posb-says/savings-account.htmlAnother $100 can be put into a robo-advisor monthly like StashAway by doing dollar cost averaging. 0 comments1"
