ProdigyAnswered on 08 Aug 2018Insurance is something ironically that you can buy when you don't need, and when you need it you can't buy it anymore.​Prudential and AIA is giving folks like yourself a second chance. Here's the links to the products: Prudential's PruVital Cover - https://www.prudential.com.sg/en/our-solutions/products/pruvital-cover/AIA's Diabetes Care - https://www.aia.com.sg/en/our-products/critical-illness-protection/aia-diabetes-care.html0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 06 Aug 2018Hi, I'm sorry to hear..I'm sure you already know most insurers will exclude your pre-existing medical illnesses.​What I can think of is tapping onto the group health insurance with your company and if you are a Singaporean receiving subsidized treatment at a medifund approved instituions but still having difficulties; to make the payments; you may want to contact for medifund assistance.​https://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/costs_and_financing/schemes_subsidies/Medifund.html​Apart from that, you may want to get coverage for yourself for other possible scenarios.. note that the premiums will definitely be higher as you will be considered high risk profile.​Hope this helps!0 comments1"

GeniusAnswered on 09 Aug 2018On top of the suggestions shared by others earlier, also consider reaching out to a social worker at your dialysis centre. He or she would be best positioned to help you manage your fees.All the best!0 comments0"
