question,"CPF Asked by AnonymousAsked on 12 May 2019Do I have enough SA to hit FRS at age 55?I am 30 yrs old.I understand from Seedly to quickly estimate FRS when I'm 55 will be ($5k x 25) + $176k which is $301k.Now, I calculate the Future Value of my 103k in my SA (if it exist!). I keep $20k in my OA for housing loan payments.25 years, 5% int, first $40k will grow to ~$135k25 years, 4% int, the remaining $63k will grow to ~$168kIn total, the future value is $303k at age 55.Is this the correct method to find out whether I have enough at this present time to hit the est.

But subject to changes of increasing FRS figure of more than 5k per year (black and white says to expect 3%), interest rate of SA, and if 55 would even matter (this could also change in 25 years). Note that you'll still have CPF contributions as well.0 comments0"
