God of WisdomAnswered on 22 Feb 2019When your investment horizon is long and you're expecting compounded growth to be your friend, going for growth stocks would be the way to go.When you're slowing down and nearing to retirement and want some passive income going, you can slowly switch over to dividend yielding stocks. But I personally believe to leave passive income to the asset class made to give you passive income. Bonds. 0 comments0"
