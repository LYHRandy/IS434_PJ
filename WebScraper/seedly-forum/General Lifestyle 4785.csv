1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 11 Jun 2019I would take that question even further - why do people like money so much, and why does it not seem to be enough? In this generation, we see the phenomenon of people still wanting more, no matter how much they had. And this is also in a world where we seeing increasing inequality. In Singapore alone, we already see elderly selling tissues at hawkers, or even older uncles and aunties asking for money near the MRT stations. When I was in Mumbai, I would be in the car driving to the office, and I would see an opulent 5-star hotel to my left, and see children begging right outside the car. Even in developed cities like New York and San Francisco, it is not an uncommon sight to see people sleeping in the frigid weather out on the streets, and even outside the Apple store.

As we fulfil the bottom tiers of Maslow's Hierarchy, we then progress to comforts and luxuries. Additionally, with the advent of social media, we are constantly exposed to influencers like the likes of Kim Kardashian etc, who readily flaunt their wealth. Other influencers follow suit, to give the impression of looking rich online. Source:  https://giphy.com/gifs/money-eastbound-and-down-kenny-powers-qi8Yhj4pKcIec1 comment3"

3,"Serene TohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 12 Jun 2019There are 2 type of people that like money.The ones that like to spend it and the ones that like to accumulate it.The ones that like to spend it, well, like to spend it. I should fall under the other category, though I do spend and not subject myself to strict budgets. If I look deep down inside me, I will summarise the need to accumulate wealth due to fear. Fear of losing job, not being able to retire properly, fear you will end up in dire states, fear of not being able to survive easily... etc. Die, I sound like those horders that accumulate lots of stuff at home. ...Suddenly thinking what it would be like to be buried under a pile of money...hmmm...

To begin, we love money because it allows us to obtain our tangible AND intangible needs & wants. The Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (as pointed out by Junus) explains this well. We attain these needs & wants for survival purposes & satisfaction respectively. The fact that money can be quantified and calculated is another reason why we love it so much. The higher the figure, the more we're able to afford our needs & wants, and therefore, the more powerful & in control we feel.0 comments1"
