MasterAnswered 3w agoBought mine this year and in the market. can share more if you pm me.But, in summary, this year there are plenty of new launches in the market and prices for the last 2 years have been quite steady or even with slight price increments or discounts depending on the development.luxury developments are moving a bit better recently due to more foreigners coming in due to their local political pressures compelling them to seek alternative safeguards outside their home country.locals have more to choose from this year, with many still on the sidelines apparently due to the uncertainty of trade wars, recessions etc.  But would expect lesser supply in the next few years as Developers plan to complete selling the current stocks, and from the lesser en-bloc and gls activities this year compared to the years before the last cooling measures in 2018.0 comments0"
