1,"Vicky FaithLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 04 Dec 2018Like what many mentioned, it depends on which company you want to work for and ideally, you should customise your resume to meet the job description. When I say customised, it's not blindly copying and pasting it, but you will need to understand the job description  know what you have to offer based on that description   reword and write it in your resume. If you're fresh grad, it means your cohort are probably competing with you to get the same job, ask yourself, what makes you different from the rest? CCA probably can help to show some traits about yourself. A team player, a leader, a determined person and more.Since you're fresh grad, companies probably wont bother much about your past work experience unless you have anything related in terms of technical skills, or transferable skills. So it is important for you to be humble, yet highlight the key traits you have.My part time job in secondary school landed me a position in polytechnic prior to O level. My part time job probably helped me to get a place in uni despite my below 3.0 GPA. When I apply for my first job after I graduated, my employer also asked a lot about my part time job and a lot of situational questions. They are probably trying to see my transferrable skills that I can bring to the job I was applying for. Dont be upset if you dont receive any calls for interview because that does not prove how bad you are as a person. I always feel that the best way to write resume, is always to know yourself and what you have got to offer first. Just remember it's not a 10 min work, it could take a day, a week or a month for the perfect resume (in your eyes) :) 0 comments6"
2,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 08 Jun 2019Depends on the job you're applying for:If is social media / start up / new company.= Skip the documents resume and get dress, prepare the script and do up a video resume. This will allows you to stand out among all documents resume!if is SME / MNC:= Back to documents resume, go sign up for a linked-in account. Search for top / best resume of the role that you're applying for, see and copy the way / style that it works.Note: As you'll be fresh grad so you also need to google for more resume samples for fresh grad, since you don't have much work experience but more educational details.Tips: Try to focus on your attachment / intern experience , highlight those!Finally, the most important is to go for more interview, the more you go, the less nerveous you'll be and the more you'll know how to answer typical questions such as:(a) Tell me about yourself.(b) what do you see yourself in 5 years(c) Tell me 3 strength / weakness that you haveRemember to research about the company and the jobs, look for points on the JD about what are they looking for and to link up what you can bring to the table to resolve their problems!Think about yourself as a Product, try to sell yourself to the company! That's how you should focus on it! :)3 comments4"

4,"Heng Kai Le, Mondomover at School Of LifeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 08 Jun 2019I was trying to look for a new job last year and hence updated my resume. So I will like to share this battle experience with you.You mentioned that your resume looks kinda boring. I think you have received many good suggestions below, so just to add on to what they said, create a resume that will reflect the real youi know it's a no-no in regards to putting various photos inside a resume, but because i kept changing jobs, i thought a photo collage depicting happy moments i experienced at all my jobs would tell my story better than a chronological description of my jobs. i also inserted three photos in the last section to showcase my personal passions.not saying that you die-die have to include photos, but my experience goes to show that there really isn't one fixed way. just chew over it and think about how you can make it more creative and just go for itthese days, a lot of graduates like to present their resume in the style of an infographic. looks sleek and succinct and easy to read. this could be you!0 comments0"
5,"Serene TohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 05 Dec 2018I tend to have a standard resume (report style) that contains all my necessary data. (education, skills, hobbies if relevent to your field)The special part is the individual letterhead for each company that I would write. You'll have to research the company you are sending the info to, to customise your letter to them, describing why you want to join them and how you can easily fit into their company, because certain skills and character you have. What you hope to achieve while you are with them. If you have a long term plan , would be even better, as a company would appreciate someone that plans to stay long term.I overheard part of this from a conversation between dad to daugther last week, an thought it was quite good advise. You can't really change your results but there are some things you can boost your submission. Use your hobbies & skills as a bonus. For example photography for artistic skills, team sports like basketball to indicate you are a team player, don't include things that make you seem like a loner.0 comments0"
6,"Yk LaiLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 05 Dec 2018I am not expert here for resume creation. But as someone who has experience to read some real candidates' resumes, my feedback is, pls write one with quality. I take the resume is part of the reflection of someone's character and working style. If I needed someone who need to write a good report, I don't look for a candidate with lots of typos and the content does not entice me calling him or her to for interview.0 comments0"
7,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 04 Dec 2018Many online tools and resources to help you. First impression counts greatly so do spend at least a day just sitting down looking at it And working to make it better.Here are some tips off the back of my mindAdd a picture of you (semi professionally taken, not selfie or bad light) ideally you can use the Potriat mode on most phones todayFocus on key points of working experienceRemove all the educational points (secondary school, JC etc) start only from poly or UniFocus on main impact factors (ie I helped grow X% or made X change in the time I was there)Last but not least, seriously look at ways you can actually get more experienced people to help you out, maybe folks who are 2-3 years your senior or even your siblings to help you vet your resume based on their job hunting experience.These should help :) all the best!0 comments0"
