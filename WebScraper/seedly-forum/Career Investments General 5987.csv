question,"Career Investments General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 18 Sep 2018Is taking CFA Level 1 beneficial? Should I just self study it if it is just for personal interest?Has anyone here done CFA level 1 (USD 1100)? Thinking of signing up for personal interest (early bird 10 oct), but not sure I will do level 2 and 3. Current job has no relevance to financial industry.  Should I instead just self study old textbooks without the test? Although it might be a good benchmark to check understanding. Has anyone taken purely for self interest before? Was it beneficial? Do you think it would be a waste in my case? Are the Schweser books (exp) really necessary?1 answerAnswerBump0"
