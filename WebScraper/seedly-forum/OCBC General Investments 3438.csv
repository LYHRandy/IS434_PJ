1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 06 Sep 2018Gabriel is right. It's not like buying insurance where there is a cooling off period and you can cancel your purchase during this period. Can consider holding the shares and wait for it to rise back up, or if you cannot hold you'll need to cut loss and sell them. For investments, only put in funds that you can afford to lose. There's no such thing as a get rich quick method when it comes to investments. 0 comments2"

WizardAnswered on 06 Sep 2018Sadly, there is no such thing as reversing your stocks purchase. ​Buying shares is not like putting money in fixed deposit or saving account. There is a risk that money can be lost.​If you are really in need of the cash, you have to decide if you want to cut your losses or continue holding the shares.​​0 comments2"

If you are investing in OCBC share for 3 years or 5 years. This is the right time to buy it. It may go down from here but for long-term investors, it is a great opportunity. ​I am not suggesting you hold it. Because the market is volatile and god knows what is hidden in the future. Moreover, I would like to suggest you to read this blog post http://www.mmfsolutions.sg/news/right-time-buy-ocbc-bank-investorstraders/​​0 comments0"

ProdigyAnswered on 07 Sep 2018First of all, let me apologise in the behalf of everyone who had senseless criticisms.To your question, unfortunately, there is no such clause to let you cancel the purchase. For all stocks, once traded, there is no refund. You can only buy/sell at the market bid/ask price.If you are that panic over a one-day change in price, I would recommend against investing in stocks for now, and spend more time reading up on securities as a whole. You are probably unsure about this investment and thus having a buyer's regret now.You have two options now: hold if you think it will appreciate, sell now if you think that it will depreciate. All these should be substantiated with your own research. But if you are so unsure right now, my advice would be to sell the stocks, keep the cash, and try again when you are more ready mentally. 0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 07 Sep 2018Sounds like a case of emotional investing. ​Investments will go up and down if you have the holding power keep it till it rises(provided it is a good stock). If you are worried about losing your capital then go for safe bets like SSB and Fixed deposits​you should not invest if the money needs to be put into immediate use within a short period. 0 comments0"
