1,"Thaddeus TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 27 Feb 2019There is no right and wrong answer for this. If i were you, i would not. after all it really depends on a few factors. 1) Are you in urgent need of the money?2) In your opinion is these bond able to sustain and give you even higher returns in the future? 3) Do you want to reallocate your finances and invest in other areas? The reason why i would not sell the bonds is that i do not need to take out the money urgently. I'm still relatively young and am able to wait till the bond matures. even then, this is with the assumption that the bond will be able to do better in the future and i will earn more from it if i sell in the future than now. Lastly, if i already have a regular savings plan, already allocating money to different forms of investments, i feel that i don't have to sell the bond as of yet so that i can diversify my portfolio.0 comments1"
2,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Feb 2019It depends on how much increase there is. Does the one time capital gain beat the interest you can get by holding it to maturity? If yes, by how much? Make sure it also covers the commission!0 comments0"
3,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 27 Feb 2019Hello!Personally, just like what the others mentioned, i would only sell my bonds if i am in need of cash. Otherwise, i would continue to hold these bonds as its value may increase even more in the future. There is no correct answer to when is the best time to sell your bonds, but here are some signs that it may be time to sell. 1) interest rates are set to rise2) if the issuing entity suddenly becomes financially unstable, suffers a huge loss that compromises its ability to remain profitable in the future.3) the market price is unusually high.Hope this helps!0 comments0"
