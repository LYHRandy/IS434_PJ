question,"Property Retirement CPF SeedlyTV EP06 Asked by Ting HanAsked on 12 Jun 2019Hi guys, I achieve the FRS when I hit 55, is it advisable to do a monthly transfer of the balance of my monthly CPF OA contribution to my CPF SA after the mthly deductions for my HDB loan repayment?More details on my question above, this would mean that my OA account would not have any increase in amount on a monthly basis (as the balance left from monthly contribution would be transferred to SA), other than the interest earned on the $20k left in my OA account. This is with the plan of leaving $20k balance in my OA upon my collection of my HDB flat in the near future.2 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"CPF BoardLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Jun 2019Hi Ting Han,Transferring your Ordinary Account (OA) savings to your Special Account (SA) is only available for members below 55 years old who do not have a Retirement Account (RA).
For members aged 55 and above, you can transfer your SA, followed by your OA savings to your RA to build up your retirement savings, up to the current Enhanced Retirement Sum. Doing so will help to build your retirement savings to give you higher monthly payouts from age 65.
You can try using this online tool to estimate the payouts under CPF LIFE: https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/Schemes/LifeEstimator/LifeEstimatorDo note that transferring your SA/OA savings to your RA cannot be reversed, so you should take into account your personal circumstances to see if itâ€™s the right move for you.Thank you.0 comments6"

Unless, you already decided that you might now wnat to upgrade, you can go ahead and proceed with your plan. However, if you are still considering to upgrade or buy a 2nd property, I will recommend you to take a more prudence approach. Which is to save some funds in your OA so that you can use it to buy a property before 55.Ting Han17 Jun 2019Thank you for your advice. It helps a lot in helping me plan for the use of my CPF funds."
