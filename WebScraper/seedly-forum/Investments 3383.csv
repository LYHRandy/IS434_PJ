MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018Whenever I see Qs on ETF, i wanna ask back what is the ultimate plan for ETF?​Income?Growth?​Recommending an ETF is easy but making money out of it will depend on the future needs of the person who have a position and the type of strategy applies along the years.​If you are still confuse by now, is better to stick to savings and i will recommend looking at CPF for retirement plan, maybe a good withdrawal at age 55 or just SSB if the amount is less then $100k for now.​Think about it.0 comments1"
3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018If you are new to etfs, consider robo advisory firms that specialise in this, maybe stashaway for a start if you have low amount of funds to start with. Your risk profile will be determined when you create an account and you run through a series of questions on the platform. Once that is done you will be recommended a portfolio to start investing into. Hope this helps 0 comments0"

5,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018Nikko AM STI ETF. This tracks the Straits Times Index, which is basically the top 30 stocks in Singapore). You can get it by subscribing to the POSB Regular Savings Plan (RSP). How this works is that you can choose to put X amount of money each month, which the RSP will help you buy a number of units of the ETF.
