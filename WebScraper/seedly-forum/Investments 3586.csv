1,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 18 May 2018There are actually 2 types of share splits.​The first type is when a company wants to lower the stock price or increase liquidity. Maybe the stock price is too high and this stops alot of traders or investors from being able to buy. ​So, the company will declare a stock split, example, 2 for 1 stock split. Meaning every current share will become 2 shares. This effectively doubles the outstanding shares and also lowers the stock price accordingly.​Another type of share split, less common is a reverse share split. To create the reverse effect, reduce the outstanding shares and increase the share price.0 comments0"
2,"Pascal SamsoonLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 17 May 2018It is when a company increases its outstanding number of shares. However, the share price will be decreased accordingly.  ​Overall, the total number of shares held will increase while the total value of shares held remain the same. ​It is a strategy to improve liquidity and make the share look ""more affordable"". ​Hope this clarifies.​Pascal0 comments0"
