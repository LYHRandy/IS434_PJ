1,"Darren ChewLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 18 Jun 2019There are quite a numbers of good dividend stocks in Singapore. Below are some criteria that you may want to consider when picking dividend stocks
1) Revenue and income growing or stable for the past 5 years.
2) Dividend stable or growing for the past 5 years
3) Dividend Yield is more than 3%.
4) Payout ratio is stable and less than 100%.
5) The company business will still be viable in the next 5 years.
6) Avoid small cap stock for dividend play. Some of the stocks are Capitaland, the 3 banks, SGX, ComfortDelgro, SATS, ST Engineering, Singtel. Just to name a few. Additional point to note, If you have a choice to choose between REITs and Business Trust, do just go only for the REITs. Hope that help.1 comment10"

3,"Elijah LeeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered on 18 Jun 2019You can consider companies which have a resilient business model. Examples are telcos, services companies (E.g. transportation) and banks. However, you will need to do your research to decide if you like the figures you see (fundamental analysis) as well as wait for the right entry point in terms of pricing. Some popular stocks would be DBS/OCBC/UOB, Singtel, Comfortdelgro, SATS, VICOM, etc.0 comments6"
4,"Tan Wei MingLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 18 Jun 2019SGX StockFacts allows you to search for dividend yield  stocks. The most important factor to take note isnt about the dividend yield but the sustainability of the dividend. I use Payout Ratio and Free Cash Flow to determine the sustainability of the dividend. For payout ratio, it must be less than 100% and for free cash flow, it must be more than the dividends paid to investors.0 comments1"
