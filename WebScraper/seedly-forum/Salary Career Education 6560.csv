2,Question Poster11 Dec 2018Isn't working experience more valued than education nowadays though?Chee Kit Chong11 Dec 2018Quite the opposite I think OP
3,"Geraldine MarkLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019You can consider deferring your studies for a year if that's an option. Gain that working experience so you enter Uni with a focused perspective on the specific skills and knowledge you want to grow. A degree is to get your foot in the industry you want to enter, after all. If the job doesn't work out or you find some aspects of it undesirable, at least you gave it a shot and you still hold your spot in Uni.1 comment2"

6,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Dec 2018I'd say stick to getting a degree. If your boss really values you, he'll want you back after you get your degree -  and offer you a higher pay.0 comments1"
7,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 07 Dec 2018Suggestion is: NO. Don't give up Uni for a job. Because educations = With you whole life once you've learned! Especially degree is basic in Singapore. Work / Job = This is only your first few job, you'll need to move on some day! Without a degree, it is harder to find better job. No matter what others may say, there's always a MNC that does first level discripmination that requires a degree. Without a degree won't even pass thru the HR screening system. I have a better suggestions for your considerations:Talk to your boss.  Discuss to arrange work part time. since you won't be having class everyday. Try to arrange it such that you can continue. It might be more tiring but you'll gain experience, able to save $ and do more than your peers and when you've completed your degree course. You're no longer a fresh graduate but an experience degree holder that will have higher chance of getting into a better company or getting a better deal in current company. All the best.  :) 0 comments1"
8,"Daniel Lee, Growth Marketing Lead at SeedlyLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 11 Dec 2018I agree with the other answerers here as well. Please do not give up your place in uni! It is important to have a degree as a fall back plan in case. Things are good now, but you'll never know what will happen to the industry or the market at any time in the future. When everything is rosy, career security and progression can always be promised. But when poo hits the fan, it's always important to have your educational qualifications that you can at least fall back on. 0 comments0"

Good on you for performing well at such an early stage of your career!I'd say stick to uni and finish your degree. You never know what sort of doors are open - or shut - just because you have or don't have that cert at the end of the day.0 comments0"
11,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Dec 2018Yes, you should stay provided you have a good boss and you are remunerated fairly based on market rates. Otherwise, it is not worth it.  At the same time, you should also go for your studies, preferably part time in NUS, if it is feasible. 0 comments0"
