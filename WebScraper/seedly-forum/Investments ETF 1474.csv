1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Apr 2019If I really need to choose, SPY will be my choice due to the size of the fund and its liquidity. But I will not consider buying the ETF to hold; will sell options on it instead for much better returns.0 comments0"
