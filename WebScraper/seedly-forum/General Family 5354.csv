1,"Kevin Zyleon NgLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019All you need to do is get your documents ready before hand. Your spouse's birth certificate, education certificates and letter of employment. Preferably get them translated into English (if they are still in their native language). Get the approval for marriage with MOM. Submit them via ICA's website and just wait patiently. You only have control over how fast things get done on your side, ICA/MOM works pretty fast if all the documents are in place.2 comments2"

I've heard so many friends having trouble and long wait times for itKevin Zyleon Ng26 Oct 2018Yes, the above is JUST getting married. There's the application for dependent pass (because work permit holders are unable to apply for PR) and of course, the elusive PR application. There are agencies out there which can help you to prepare your documents before you go for PR application. The costs are steep though."
