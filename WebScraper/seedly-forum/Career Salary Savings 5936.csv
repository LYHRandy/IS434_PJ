question,"Career Salary Savings Asked by AnonymousAsked on 31 Oct 2018Anyone knows what are the best savings account for entrepreneurs? Since I don't have a ""credited salary"" which is one of the main requirements of such BYOB Account?I am in my last year of uni, I run a blog that generates me about 3k a month. I have accumulated about 30k in my POSB savings account. I don't spend much (about $400 a month after incl. insurance and stuff). After some research I realised that the best account is POSB's Build Your Own Boss but I realised that it requires salary crediting. I just collect sales by Paypal and then transfer to my POSB account currently. Not sure how it works now...1 answerAnswerBump0"

MasterUpdated on 31 Oct 2018Since you don't meet the salary crediting requirement, you should consider using CIMB FastSaver instead which gives you 1% interest per annum so long as you maintain at least $1,000 in your account. Also, it doesn't have any other requirements to enjoy the 1% interest and you can easily sign up for an account online.
