1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 09 Mar 2019Etfs are basically funds traded on the stock exchange. The most common one here is the STI, offered by both State Street and Nikko. For Nikko you can buy in on a monthly basis (dollar cost average) via any posb or dbs atm or through their Internet portal. For State Street, you can do dollar cost averaging via Maybank KE. Both platforms start at $100 per month and there is no commitment period.As both etfs are listed on the SGX, you can just buy into them via any local broker.And yes, both of these etfs are dividend paying. Hope this helps0 comments0"
