question,Investments Money FM 89.3 Show Asked by AnonymousAsked on 31 Aug 2019Do you prefer to save up a war chest first before investing? Or invest with whatever you have in hand first?It’s always so tempting for me to put whatever I have in first because I never know if the share price is going to drop back to that price. But knowing that there are extra fees charged per trade. Is it worth for me to do so?11 answersAnswerBump6

1,"Dhruv Arora, Founder & Chief Executive Officer at SyfeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 5. GeniusUpdated on 04 Sep 2019Before you start investing, I’d suggest setting aside an emergency fund containing 3 – 6 months’ of expenses, having adequate insurance, and no high-interest loans. A home mortgage is ok, but try to avoid high-interest debt like credit card debts. In investing, time really is money. The longer you invest, the more money you will have, thanks to the power of compounding. Compounding i.e. time in the market is one of the keys to investment success, rather than waiting for the perfect moment to invest. It's nearly impossible for any investor to time the market perfectly on a regular basis. So, realistically, the best action that a long-term investor can take is to invest as soon as possible, regardless of the current stock market conditions. Furthermore, don’t let the size of your savings deter you from investing at the earliest possible moment. If you want exposure to Singapore equities, you can now invest from as little as $100 each month with Regular Shares Savings (RSS) Plan. If you want a globally diversified portfolio, you can consider digital wealth managers like Syfe. Syfe has no minimum investment amount and unlike traditional brokerages, no commission charge each time you increase your investment. Finally, some advice against picking individual stocks. You should always diversify your investments, rather than go all-in on one specific stock. This way if one underperforms, it doesn’t drag down your whole portfolio.2 comments8"

God of WisdomAnswered on 02 Sep 2019A war chest will come in handy, but you should look at investing piecemeal when opportunities present themselves. Since we don't know when the market will come down, investing when good value presents itself will at least ensure you do not sit on too much cash.For myself, I RSP regularly into UTs, while buying stocks occasionally which I deem to be undervalued. The war chest is ready for a crash, but markets are telling me it's not time yet.0 comments7"

GeniusAnswered on 21 Sep 2019Assuming you are young, and with no dependents with an active life, do consider to buy personal accident insurance and top up your Medishield Life plan to an Integrated Health Shield plan (if you like private hospital treatment). Frankly, I believe that Singapore's public health system is really good and a Medishield Life plan is good enough, subject to personal ward preferences. Apart from personal accident, you should consider critical illness or term life - if you think you will start a family. This is to future proof your ability to provide for dependents - because starting term life insurance (not whole life) and critical illness at a young age is cheaper.Apart from protecting your future, set aside emergency funds of 3-6 months income - depending on your lifestyle. With technology affecting job roles, you should be prepared for future changes. After that, you can consider investing. But there is no need to build a ""war chest"" as there is no end to the human perceived size anyway. Just start with what is available and keep investing to smooth out the ups and downs of markets. Stay focused and pick your risk appetite carefully. Fix a time horizon of at least one to three years. Any shorter, and you will be no different from a trader, speculator or gambler!Singapore is fortunate to have digital investment services offering low fees and low investment entry. So check them out.All the best!0 comments4"

Just like Warren Buffett chooses to sit on his cash pile (like right now) when markets are overvalued, you don't have to feel compelled to invest just because you have money in hand.0 comments1"

Grand MasterAnswered on 05 Sep 2019Don't have to be All or No.Invest with whatever you have, but on a long term basis.Say I have a surplus of $500 per month currently, I would probably not invest the whole $500 on a monthly stock purchase plan.I will probably do a $200 or $300 per month purchase (OR more likely I will do a $300 per quarter if my amount is small)Then the rest goes into a flexible bank account for opportunities.0 comments1"
7,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusAnswered on 02 Sep 2019I had a problem in this area, so I started thinking about my framework. To spare you the details of my thought process (took a couple of mths), I came up with my own approachA) split my monthly excess/savings into two parts, 1/3 for regular investing, and 2/3 for the war chest.B) for the 1/3 portion for regular investing, I put it into an RSP like BCIP, and focus only on one share, which is decided roughly along the lines of the best dividend yield stock among the options which I am comfortable with its profitability, growth rate, ROE, and governance. Every few weeks, I redo my screening on the SGX screener and consider if there's a better one, and if so, change the BCIP instructions. The shortest duration for a change I did with this method was SGX, for 4 mths after the price hit 7.4, and it has hit 8+ now. C) the 2/3 portion goes into a savings goal. For this, I set a criterion that I can only take $$ out if the dividend yield of the share (that meets my criteria) is above R x 3 mth SIBOR rate (R = 2.3 for shares, and 3.3 for REITs. 2.3 x 2% = 4.6% now). So if there's nothing that meets this criterion, the $$ earns 3.2% interest risk-free in my 360 Account. If there's something that meets it, I already saved up for it and so no guilt about the share purchase.This is my two cents. I recognize I have limitations, but hopefully, with this framework, I would not run out of cash when the yields are attractive, but yet not too fixated on catching the bottom (and taking in low interest on cash hoarding). I have seldom caught the real bottom, to be honest, and I am not so sure how others know when the ""right"" time to buy is ""right"".0 comments1"
8,"JackLevel 2. RookieAnswered 3w agoPersonally, what I like to do is to dollar cost average into the stock I want to buy. When there’s a sudden drop in price due to negative news and If I believe that the price will recover, I may put more money on my next purchase. I don’t recommend investing everything in one shot as it is risky. But if you like to put large sums and not dollar cost average, maybe you can split it into 2 or 3 purchases at the support levels.0 comments0"
9,"Vincent Tan Wen Bin, Assistant Vice President at Thinkers AllianceLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 03 Sep 2019Personally I would build up my emergency fund worth about 6 months to 1 year worth of current expenses.
You can also use a RSP (regular saving plan) process to acquire stocks and/or funds if you do not have much lump sum to invest.
The key is to start investing early and at the same time build up your investment knowledge and active income. So when the moment comes when you do have a large war chest, you will know how to utilize it the best way.0 comments0"
10,"Zen Rogue XuanLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 03 Sep 2019Time and time again, it has been proven that time in the market wins: https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/c02ml4/timing_the_market_the_absolute_worst_vs_absolute/ From one's perspective, the market can always go higher/lower, and that there will be a better opportunity out there. Rather than trying to time the market, start with what you have. Investing should be a boring, routine thing- if you want excitement, go to the amusement park, or worst, the Casino.0 comments0"

ProdigyUpdated on 31 Aug 2019Hi there, ""never know if the share price is going to drop back to that price"" - If you are new to investing this fear of missing out is hard to get past. Prices almost always come back to ""that price"" at some stage.I'd suggest learning a bit from history. Look back at price actions in 2008 carefully.In addition, I have got this youtube video to share with you below. Hope it helps!More ... Should you buy when markets are up?0 comments0"
12,"Wei ShengLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 31 Aug 2019From my perspective, I invested using money that I have allocated within my War Chest. I would allocate money into the war chest based on my Investment horizon, risk appetite and Investment Style. One tip to note, It's ideal to have an emergency fund of at least 6 months salary before you begin to invest.0 comments0"
