question,"Investments Asked by Andrew ChiaAsked on 13 Nov 2018How long term investors keep discipline when market is undergoing correction?For investors who practice buy and hold for long term (>5years), how do u instill discipline and ignore the short terms swings in price and at the same time be in tuned to market sentiments /news? Especially in recent times, moderate down swings (brain) makes me wanna sell (in fear of it going even lower) but heart says otherwise (cos I should be in for the long run. )2 answersAnswerBump1"

When entering an investment, understand the following:1) Why did you invest?2) Did the fundamentals Change?3) Is it a short term correction?4) Whats the correlation to the Market?Most importantly, set a stop loss and abide by it, rather than let emotions take over.You should also consider the above questions. if you still do see potential, perhaps its time to buy more when its going down, or in other terms Dollar/Value cost averaging.0 comments0"
