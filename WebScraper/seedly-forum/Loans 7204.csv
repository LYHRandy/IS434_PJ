1,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 Nov 2018Debt (no 's', like sheep) typically refers to money that is owed to someone else from borrowing. Typically you want to be the guy who someone owes debt to, not the other way round. Debt is often unwanted and unhealthy since it is in essence, you owing money and likely having to pay a specific interest rate on it - whether its debt you owe on your credit card, house, car, student loans, etc. There are instances where debt is good also, but I'll stop here and keep it simplistic for you. Generally try to avoid debt or pay it off quickly. The only exception would be if your debt interest rate is low. 0 comments0"
