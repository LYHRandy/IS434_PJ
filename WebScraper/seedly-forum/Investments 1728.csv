God of WisdomAnswered on 09 Apr 2019A 100% global equity portfolio overweighting in smaller cap value stocks with emerging market exposure. Such a portfolio with the right funds capturing the above asset allocation would have given you 9% p.a return for the last 25 years.If you want to sacrifice on some diversification, going narrower and overweighting into financials and tech can give you higher short term return but a recession may hit you extra hard.0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 08 Apr 2019If you have a high risk appetite but you still want a diversified portfolio, you can get sectorial diversification while investing in Asia Ex-Japan, which will give you a broad list of emerging markets while covering your main equity sectors. You can toss in like 10 or 20% bonds as well if you'd like, and make them high-yield if you really have a high risk appetite (high yield bonds dont have the same correlation as efficient bonds).This kind of portfolio that I've spoken about typically does between 8 and 14% annualized, which I'd love to show you in person if this is something you're genuinely keen on exploring. https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
