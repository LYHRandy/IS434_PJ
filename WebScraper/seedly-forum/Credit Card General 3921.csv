Adding on from Kenneth's post, I think it's also important to see if you want just one card, or if you are okay to spread your miles among different cards for different purchases. As a guide these are some of the more popular cards in the field:DBS WWMC 4mpd for online spend cap at 2k a month. Points expire in 1 year if I remember correctly DBS altitude/Citibank premier miles card: basic entry level miles card that gives 1.2mpd for most spending (might get more mpd on certain categories like online travel etc), points don't expire the new BOC miles card: current promo till Dec that earn more than the altitude/premier miles. However have also read reviews that the card takes really long to arrive, and their internet banking is quite primitive üòÇ  points have expiry date 1-2 years too.amex krisflyer is the only card that credits miles directly into your krisflyer account, instead of accumulating bank points then transferring in a lump sum of points. Also, collecting air miles usually requires some effort too! Bear in mind if you just want one card, miles collecting might be slower, and make sure to check the points expiry with the bank. But if you spread yourself out too much with many cards, beware of orphan points when you don't hit the min points to exchange them to miles.I hope I did not just confuse üòÇüòÇ have fun with the miles game! I'm still learning too :) 0 comments2"

You can try checking out the blog for weekly card reviews.Regarding best miles card, it depends on your lifestyle really because the card companies do give bonus miles in certain categories. If you know which merchants you regularly transact act, you can again go to the site to use the merchant search tool to see which card gives you the most miles for spending there.0 comments0"

WizardAnswered on 31 Aug 2018I'm by no means a miles expert but been studying it for quite some time with my Fianc√© because we plan to work backwards for our upcoming wedding to plan 2 years in advance to see how we can maybe fly first class (at least once in our lives) lol. A trip to US on the first class cabin would cost us 120-130k miles per person... means we will need double that! LOL.‚ÄãIn the description below, I have included some card recommendations also! ‚ÄãHere are some tips which I've picked up along the way:Have a miles strategy (start with the end in mind, eg a trip for a honeymoon to X country with X miles needed for business class)Work backwards till todayFind the best card based on your needs (are you a local, overseas or online spended primarily) For example for online spend, you can use the Woman's World mastercard(http://10x/4mpd for online spending. (Grab, Fave, and pretty much everything online%29) which gets you almost 10x/4mpd for online spending. (eg GRAB, Lazada etc) or the CITI rewards Card which seems to be highly rated as well.Only spend on either Business or First class (it's most worth it only on those)Sign up bonuses (time your purchases eg home renovation or pre-wedding or banquet packages) these are hugePaying for yearly renewals to get the miles (per dollar)You can consider using Mileslife but not many merchants on it yet (it's like a payment option which allows you to redeem miles per spend) The bonuses here are pretty good also (get 1,000 when you sign up)Finally, without fail, subscribe to Milelion and his blog at http://milelion.com/ he's clearly niched himself very well in that space :) And he has a telegram group as well where miles hunters hang out frequently. 0 comments0"
