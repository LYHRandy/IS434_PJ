1,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Kraft Heinz Stocks are tanking due to the inability of the company to change with the times - nowadays consumers demand more healthy varieties and options, such as gluten free/organic products, which kraft heinz's line of products do not appropriately cater to. Their line of condiments and products such as squeezy instant cheese, mayonaise etc. have not fundamentally changed for the past few years, which have not helped the fact that their competitors such as Mondelez and General Mills have jumped on the organic produce bandwagon. as a result, KRaft Heinz posted huge losses due to the $15.4 billion writedown of its Kraft and Oscar Mayer Brands, and has reduced the dividend payout. All not good signs of healthy growth.  $8.3 billion from an intangible asset writedown of the Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands and $7.1 billion from a goodwill impairment to its North American refrigerated and retail business. Kraft Heinz has also a SEC probe into its accounting practices, where not much information has been released. This is especially worrying as it signals to investors that there may be fundamental problems with the earnings reports and accounting standards of the company. As a result, investors are currently fleeing the asset, and there is a huge selling pressure which has resulted in the dip in price.Though some may recommend buying the dip, I suggest to hold off until the SEC probe results to understand the true state of KHC's accounting and books.1 comment2"

WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pqc56crs56sAt time 17.56 to 23.56, Warren Buffet stated he miscalculate on Kraft. He explain about the business and why it was a tough one.Totally understand the thesis behind it.Don't hear it from us. Hear it directly from the person himself.2 comments0"
4,"Question Poster01 Mar 2019Thanks alot for the video! it helped me understand the situation better.Terence Tan01 Mar 2019Someone actually asked me the same question on other platforms if we should look at kraft now. This is my reply ""I will continue to ignore Kraft Heinz after going thru the Warren Buffet video. At 17.59 to 23 mins, he commented packaged food products/FMCG are losing out to home brands at walmart or costco. Home brands are earning more money for these retailers with lesser number of shops. In my opinion, this is happening in SG as well. I see myself buying more home brands stuff (Sheng Siong = Happy Family, NTUC = fairprice or Pasar) from the supermarkets. Hope this explains."""
5,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 25 Feb 2019Just to add on, another potential reason why the shares could have tanked is due to revenue and earnings fall short of estimates.In the long run, others have also speculated that packaged foods are becoming less popular. People are more focused on fresh food or more niche brands that offer more interesting flavours.There has also been talk about management having adopted the wrong strategy, by focusing on driving costs down, and neglecting its brand equity admist changing trends. The move to cut costs could have also led to less investments to develop the brand as a whole.0 comments0"
