question,"Savings Bank Account Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 29 Aug 2019How much should I be saving if I'm 24 years old and am currently on a 1-year contract with $2,240 take-home pay?Breakdown of expenses: $400 (daily)$85 (bills)$161 (insurance) $200 (savings plan)Not be getting married/BTO anytime soon. Parents expect me to give them money every month (amount at my discretion). I read online that I should be saving 20% of my income, but I think it's too low. I'd love to have guidance on how much I should be saving (& how much to give my parents). And perhaps where is the best place for me to channel these savings. Thanks!1 answerAnswerBump0"

When you're single without much commitments, you should be saving 60%. Once you get married and a home, that drops to 40%, and then when you have kids, you'll probably save 25-30%.2 comments2"
2,"Question Poster31 Aug 2019Wow, I'm assuming the 60% already includes 20% that goes to CPF?Hariz Arthur Maloy31 Aug 2019Nope, 60% of take home pay. Yeah I'm serious. If you can do it, you can retire earlier. If not possible, try 40%."
