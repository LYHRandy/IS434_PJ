question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 26 May 2019How to hv pay raise & convert to Perm staff? Contract 2yr renew 1 yr+1 yr again. Now Yr 5, still Contract staff! Management won't convert to Perm or up my pay, citing my contract ""no pay raise""But add work load! Unfair! Team members all Perm nw! Even those who join 1 yr ago! Manager say if I improve teamwork MAYBE hv pay raise! Stupid reasons for no pay raise & convert to Perm staff -must wait for Perm staff to resign then I replace, quota reach, FY over, some staff wk 5-10yrs no pay raise & still Contract too! Feel that Co condemn me as my communication skill weak, sometimes got conflict with colleagues. They complain & ostracise me.I am 51 yo woman, hard to resign & get new job.3 answersAnswerBump1"

My dad works as a delivery driver for a company for 20years and they didn't even gave him a pay raise either. Only when he decided to leave, they asked if it was about the pay, this shows alot about a company.0 comments1"
