If it doesn't, better keep the money where it is. Personally I would be thinking about the 175k not insured.2 comments0"
2,"Question Poster05 Dec 2018Thank you for the link! I read it up and apparently it requires me having cold hard cash of 250k which i am unable to do so.. So i decide to continue normal banking and work harder towards that goal now! On a side note.. what is the 175k not insured information that you are referring to? I cannot seem to find it..Lok Yang Teng05 Dec 2018Singapore Deposit Insurance (SDI) only insurers up to 75k in each bank account (up from 50k previously). In the unlikely event money is lost, anything more than 75 will not be claimable."
