SPDR, as well as Nikko AM. You can google to see how their historical performances compare against each other!0 comments0"

MasterUpdated on 02 Oct 2018You dun really have to sell your invest saver, you can leave it there without monthly contribution if im not wrong, its up to you. STI ETF got 2 different company. 1 is SPDR, another is Nikko. There are a few different SPDR ETF in SGX. POSB is Nikko STI ETF. Most people think SPDR STI ETF is better than Nikko STI ETF.0 comments0"
