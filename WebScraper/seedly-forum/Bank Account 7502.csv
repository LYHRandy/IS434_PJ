question,Bank Account Asked by AnonymousAsked on 14 Dec 2018Is there a relatively fuss free account that I can use for spending that has little or no minimum balance that I can just use for spending?I've been using the OCBC frank account since I was in uni. Since there was no minimum balance all I had to do was to transfer however much I wanted to spend for that month into my FRANK account and use that for spending while my savings/salary went in another account (out of sight out of mind). I'm turning 26 next year so I would need to keep a minimum balance in the FRANK account and am thus thinking of closing the account altogether. Finding out what are some of the other options I have? :)1 answerAnswerBump0

Similar to other banks, you'll be charged a fall-below fee if your balance is below a certian amount after reaching a certain age. In this case, you may consider opening and using a DBS/POSB savings account along with a debit card which can all be applied for online. I'm using DBS Savings Plus along with a DBS Visa Debit Card and I understand that there won't be a fall-below fee of $2 for not maintaining the minimum average daily balance until you reach 29 years old. Alternatively, you can also consider getting a credit card since you seem to do budgeting and are able to control your finances/expenses well! Moreover, you'll be able to earn cash rebates/miles/rewards depending on the type of credit card that you have. Just make that you pay your monthly credit card bills on time to prevent any late payment fees or interest charges! 0 comments1"
