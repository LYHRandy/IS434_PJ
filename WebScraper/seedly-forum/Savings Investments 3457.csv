1,"Soon XiaohuiLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 28 Aug 2018I feel it's totally alright. While in the mean time, do educate yourself more on how to build your portfolio, selecting the right stocks for your portfolio, etc and learn how to control your emotions while doing investment on your own. ​But here is a tip for ya, even when the stock market crash, please avoid putting everything in at one go. This is a typical gambler behavior, not investor behaviour. How to be a investor - you gotten do some homework first before any investment. Therefore do take the current opportunity to do your homework first, when the time has arrived then slowly excute your plan. ​Good luck on your investment journey :) 0 comments3"
2,"Jacky YapLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 29 Aug 2018I think this is a question of rebalancing your portfolio. ​Here's how i split my holdings:​Equity (Stock market) - Currently the highest because it is still at the tail end of the up market. I'm also trading in and out (for US stocks) instead of holding long term since the ""crash"" might come soon. Bond (SSB / CPF) - Relatively safe, dont have SSB but treating my CPF as my bond portionCash - In a high interest rate savings account (DBS multiplier)​You can rebalance the % of the holdings based on how soon you think the ""crash"" is coming. If you think it's this week, then maybe reduce the equity holding and put more into bond / cash. :) 0 comments1"
3,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 29 Aug 2018Personally believe in 'TIME IN MARKET' vs 'TIMING THE MARKET' ​This is for 3 main reasons:​1) Look at the long term chart of any market index​What that means, is to continue to Dollar Cost Average in Index funds or ETFs.​In the SG (Straits Times Index)​​In the US (Dow Jones Index)​​This article would paint a better picture for you if you were to do the DCA strategy for the past years.​2) Diversify your portfolio​Don't put all your eggs into one basket. Any prudent DIY investor would diversify across stocks in several sectors (eg retail, property REITs, Blue chips and index funds) ​And a stock market crash would also result in several counters being affected but of course some more than others. ​3) Honestly, nobody will know when a stock market crash is really coming​Nobody can know when a crash is coming. Especially the gurus you see on the TV. They aren’t using academic data or arguments. Or any blog for that matter (or any of us). ​Unless you are in a giant hedge fund, eg those on wall street where information is analysed everyday, it is highly unlikely that you would face any headwinds and also dare to act on any information that you recieve. We are merely passengers on this giant ship if you decide to jump in the investment markets. If this is a Titanic, we are just along for the ride :) (That's my personal opinion la)​I'm going to quote an answer which I found which is also very well put:​""Nobel Laureate William Sharpe wrote a paper in 1975 called “Likely Gains from Market Timing”. He found that a market timers must be accurate 74% of the time in order to outperform a passive portfolio.​This may surprise viewers of CNBC and Bloomberg. The advisory group CXO looked at forecasts from well known market gurus who appear on the show. They looked at their forecasts. Marc Faber was only right 44% of the time. The most successful was Ken Fisher, who was right 66% of the time.​However, none were right at the 74% threshold which makes market timing profitable. Remember, being right 66% of the time isn’t going to be as profitable as staying invested for three reasons.​One, you will need to hold money in cash when you think a crash is coming. Two, when you are sometimes wrong (the 33%+ of the time) you are missing out on good gains from those days when markets soar. Three, you will be accumulating costs, including trading costs and tax from selling""​Why do DIY retail investors, 80%-90% of them fail? They fail due to using emotions and not rationality. Emotions like:Fear. The market is going to collapse!Egosim. They allow short-term performance to get to their headGreed - wanting to get super big returns.Conclusion: We are retail investors, not hedge fund managers​So with all things considered and the above 3 pointers, I hope you see my perspective and also start to do a meaningful DCA. But at the same time, not put all your eggs in one basket (but importantly diversify).​Also, word of caution, don't go all in. I believe having restful sleep is priceless and having sleepless nights (to me personally) is not worth any money at all. haha. All the best friend! :)0 comments1"
4,"Grace CongLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 28 Aug 2018Same as Pete, I would suggest you study and practice placing trades now. TD Ameritrade has this platform called Think or Swim which has a PaperMoney section, basically a simulated trading section where you are given 100k paper money to invest and trade with. That way once you're ready and the market crash comes, you just switch over to actual market transactions (with your own real money of course). Or even if the crash doesn't come, you can still make winning trades, depending on the trading or investing strategy you eventually settle on.Do keep some of that cash as your emergency funds, though.0 comments1"
5,"Eric Chia, Senior Financial Consultant at PrudentialLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 28 Aug 20185 years ago, I thought the real estate market crash would come - everyone was saying and seemingly people are buying homes a lot. But it never came. Prices went up and 3 years back I bought my home. Now my home is worth more than it was 3 years ago.​Timing investments is a bad idea - no one knows when the market goes up and down. You shouldn't wait for things to happen - the best time to start is now.​Don't invest your savings; invest the excess of money you have. And invest wisely. Look for opportunities and things that you see it's value appreciating. Know your risk appettie - if you are up for adventure, FOREX or shares can be the thing. On the other extreme, if you are very capital sensitive, fixed deposits will do the job.​If you are up for a balance, then insurance savings and unit trusts can be the thing.​Leaving excess money in the bank is the worst. It's interest rate can't hedge against inflation. The more you wait, the less you earn.0 comments1"
6,"Pete Tan, Investment Coach and Equity Analyst at Value Investing CollegeLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 28 Aug 2018There is no right or wrong but I would definitely suggest that you start practicing investing now to prepare for the crash. Staying on the sideline will likely result in inaction during crash too. 0 comments1"
