God of WisdomAnswered on 15 May 2019If you really know when it's going to crash, then you should buy an Inverse Tracker. Market go down x%, your fund goes up x%.But I suggest not timing the market. We've been thinking market gonna crash since 2016. You can pivot to a more defensive portfolio, but maybe try not to exit the market in total.0 comments0"
