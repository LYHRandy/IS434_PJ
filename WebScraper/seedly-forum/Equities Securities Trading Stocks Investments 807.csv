A good price reference is  http://www.fuwell.com.sg/ (download the price list). Strange enough that they only have the curved ones now at the bottom end for Samsung.And get loads of RAM (2x 16GB), Samsung 1TB SSD, and if you need more space to store historical data for crunching algo models, another non-SSD harddisk (hunt for HGST ones if you can, though seems like they are getting rarer).0 comments0"
