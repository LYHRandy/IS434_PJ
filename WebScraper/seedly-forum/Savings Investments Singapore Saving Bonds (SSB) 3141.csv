You have to understand them before you get into it, and not follow someone's advice blindly!

Meanwhile, you can put it in a high savings interest account like CIMB FastSaver which gives 1% interest per annum or you can also consider CIMB's Fixed Deposit Christmas promotion which gives you 1.90% interest for 12 months!Once you've learnt more, you can consider some low-medium risks investments like STI ETF and US ETFs via Robo-advisors0 comments0"
