Here are some essential indicators and numbers to take note!DPU increased 6.6% (to 3.07cents)Distributable income increased 9% (from $53.5million to $58.3million) Gross revenue increased by 2.3% (from $91.5million to $93.6million) Average portfolio occupancy increased to 88.2% from 86.7% in previous quarter.Gearing ratio stood at 34.7%.MIT has grown its DPU from 0.24 cents in FY12/13 to 11.75 cents in FY17/18. This gives investors a 4.9% CAGR! The gain in this quarter was driven by a build-to-suit project for HP Singapore, as well as contributions from new properties; 7 Tai Seng and Mapletree sunview. MIT's gearing ratio is way below the regulatory gearing limitation of 45%, signifying a healthy position. Additionally, MIT's acquisition of 7 Tai Seng, 18 Tai Seng and Mapletree sunview will grow its high tech building and data centre portfolio, thus increasing the overall portfolio WALE (weighted average lease expiry), providing income stability.
