1,"EEdisonLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 06 Mar 2019What do you means by guaranteed returns? 
I have never seen a REIT that guarantees that their NAV won't go down.Although they are required to give out a certain percentage of their earnings as dividends by law, there is no guarantee that the dividends can make up for drop in NAV.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 06 Mar 2019People have become a little wiser to the fact that property in Singapore isn't the way it once was, which is why the emphasis for returns has been a bit more on overseas REITs and overseas property. It doesn't have guaranteed returns but I get what you mean. Because REITs are obligated to pay up to 90% of its profits to its investors on a regular basis, so even if the value of your unit goes down, you receive dividends and feel like its a regular, guaranteed return (although its not).Like Hariz said, property is sensitive to interest rates. Not everyone will buy that, knowing that they could potentially lose a lot of money in the short term. Historically, REITs are even more volatile than stocks in Singapore. You can always drop me a message if you're looking for avenues of guaranteed or non-guaranteed return. https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 06 Mar 2019No investment has guaranteed returns.Property is highly sensitive to interest rates. As a lot of them use gearing or leveraging to finance the properties they hold. So there'll always be a chance of negative performance of the REIT.0 comments0"
