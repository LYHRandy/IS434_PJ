1,"GTGabriel Tan Jun WeiLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 30 May 2018Hi ​I agree with Gabriel. Consider adding rider to your current policy. But if the plan doesn't allow, you can consider a standalong early CI plan with no cash value.​But if you want something limited pay, then you can consider having a whole life with early CI. ​I'll drop you my email gabrielgrantt@aia.com.sg if you need a second quotation!0 comments2"
2,Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 30 May 2018Check if you can add on a CI rider on your existing policies. It is much better in terms of trying to claim and also save you money.​You might also want to evaluate if you really need 2 life policies that you currently hold.0 comments1
3,"Brandan ChenLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Jun 2018Similar thoughts with both Gabriels.Option 1: add on a rider to your existing WL plan.Pros: Limited pay, Lifetime coverage
Cons: More expensive compared to Term, Sum assured of your existing plan will decrease if you make a claimOption 2: Stand alone CI plansPros: Cheaper, May allow for multiple claims
Cons: Pay till you do not want coverageAs a rule of thumb, you should cover ~10x your annual income for Death & Diability, and ~4-5x your annual income for CI (including ECI) 0 comments0"
