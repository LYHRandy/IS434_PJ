1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 07 Mar 2019I feel that the biggest mistake, along with not understanding what you're investing in is being too emotional and panicky when making decisions. This can lead you to situations where you blindly follow others or to make decisions without thinking enough. Another potential pitfall I feel is being too greedy initially and just wanting to make as much returns as possible, without thinking through a potential strategy or staying invested for the long term. Not sure if this can be considered the biggest mistake, but I feel that not sticking to an investment or a portfolio strategy can also be an issue, and merely flipping around with your portfolio strategies. I feel that being consistent is much better here!0 comments0"
2,Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 06 Mar 2019Hello! I personally feel that one of the bigget mistake would be inveesting in things that you are not familiar in especially if you are a beginner. I think what most beginners would do is to listen to what people around them are saying to invest in and just follow. I feel that it is essential to understand what exactly you are investing in and not just follow what others are asking you to do. Hope this helps!0 comments0
3,"Leong Wen FongLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 06 Mar 2019I think most of the community can agree on one mistake:Investing in something you don't knowBeginners sometimes see ""investing"" as a way to make more money quickly (because of various reasons). Sometimes due to bad advice from friends, or other times due to simple hype, Beginners invest into something that is highly volatile and unknown - without fully understanding what they are getting into ahem crypto.There are many more simple general advice on Seedly to kickstart investing in a safer and more prudent way. However I believe this mistake is not only made by beginners, but even some more veteran investors.So, avoid what you don't know.0 comments0"
