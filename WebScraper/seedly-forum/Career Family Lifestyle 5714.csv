question,"Career Family Lifestyle Asked by MujimoroAsked on 24 Jun 2019When u get a bonus at work, do you (1) spend it on yourself/family or (2) invest it? A bonus feels like just that - bonus money to spend on things you like (and deserve :)). How many of you spend your bonuses, as opposed to investing it?family5 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"DeleteEditHC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 24 Jun 2019I'll spend 10 to 20% upgrading myself to earn more in the future. I'll probably use 5% to pamper myself if there's some place i really wanna go or something I really want. Balance save it for current or future investment. There are too many ways to spend $ but limited ways to invest good for future. Best to delay gratification than regret later.0 comments4"

5,"JLJ LLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 24 Jun 2019For now I’m still saving up my emergency savings, so I maintain the same amount of expenses as any other months, putting that bonus into my emergency savings first. That being said, I think it’s ok to treat yourself but set a percentage limit of your bonus e.g 20% then save/invest the rest.1 comment1"
