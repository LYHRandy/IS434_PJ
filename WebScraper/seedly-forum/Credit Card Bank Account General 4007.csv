WonderkidAnswered on 23 Aug 2019Just call in to the credit card hotlines (tip: call during offpeak hours) to cancel. Be firm about wanting to cancel and voila, it's usually processed within the day. :) Hope this helps!0 comments1"

4,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Aug 2019Um, you can't avoid CS as they are the ones who process your cancellation application. Normally they will just go ahead and cancel but they will act a bit, try to convince you to stay etc. Most of the time I just say, ""oh I am emigrating"" or""Oh I am posted overseas for work"". Most of the time, the conversation ends here and my card is cancelled. If you are afraid of the CS kaypoh and ask here ask there, just use the above reasons.0 comments0"
