Price fluctuation | ProfitingYou can head on to http://www.sgs.gov.sg/savingsbonds/About-SSB/Risks.aspx for more info but here's the answer specific to your question:""However, you will always get your principal back when investing in Savings Bonds. Once a Savings Bond is issued, interest rate changes will have no effect on the bond’s value.""Therefore, bond prices will remain as it is throughout your entire investment period. But do note there's a $2 transaction fee to whenever each transaction is performed. Maturity PeriodThis bond is a 10-year bond with a step-up interest rate at some years into your investment. If you hold the entire 10 years, it'd be on average 2.13% simple interest for the entire 10-years vested.Hope it answers your question :)2 comments0"

Does that mean in theory I could buy this bond and we find a few months later there is a new issuance of the same bond with higher rates, I could see this bond and buy the new issuance? If it falls - then I just keep the bond as the principal value doesn’t change?Billy Ko15 May 2019You're most welcome and absolutely, you're free to enter and exit whenever you want. They will accrued (pro-rated) interest should you choose to redeem before the payment date.
