1,"Dhruv Arora, Founder & Chief Executive Officer at SyfeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 5. GeniusUpdated on 17 Jul 2019Hi Darren,My name is Dhruv Arora, and Iâ€™m the founder and CEO of Syfe. Thanks for your interest in finding out more about Syfe.My experience as both an investment banker and then a consumer technology expert was a building block at Syfe - we always wanted to bring the best of financial services to the masses. Syfe is built for all investors, whether you are new to investing or a seasoned investor. And we have.Your process starts with understanding your correct risk appetite through our robust yet straightforward Risk Profiler (for free). That is when the real magic begins.
Our proprietary Automated Risk-managed Investments methodology (ARI) will allocate assets which have shown the best return for your risk profile. But more importantly, it continually monitors your portfolio. During periods where higher market volatility has been forecasted, ARI will adjust your portfolio allocation and reduce your exposure to higher-risk asset classes. This ensures your portfolio risk stays aligned to your desired risk level.
Conversely, during periods of market calm, ARI will adjust your portfolio allocation to allocate more to higher-risk assets, so your overall portfolio risk is kept in line with your desired risk exposure, but you can capture the market upside as well.
The result is that ARI helps you achieve benchmark-beating returns by maintaining your desired risk level, no matter what market conditions maybe, just as a real wealth manager should do for you, round the clock.For more details on ARI, you can also check out our investment methodology paper here.I hope this helps. Do not hesitate to reach out should you have any other queries. Happy investing.1 comment8"

3,"Yuva ViswanathanLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 17 Jul 2019To give my own 2 cents, Syfe seems to be a robo advisor like StashAway, AutoWealth etc. At 0.65% AUM, it does seem pricey especially since they do seem to have asset allocation in SDPR and IShares ETFs, which you can technically buy on your own using a Saxo Investor brokerage account.Rather than diving head long in, I do advise acquiring some knowledge first and then truly understanding the investing world. I am not averse to paying fees for sure, but you ought to really understand what you're paying for in the first place. You can never control investment returns, but you can control costs that do eat into your returns.For starters, I highly advise reading Financial Horse's guide to investing to get started : https://financialhorse.com/guide-to-investing/0 comments0"
