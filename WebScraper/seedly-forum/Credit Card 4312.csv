MasterAnswered on 20 Sep 2018Yes miles are credited directly so you only have to monitor the miles expiry on the KrisFlyer side ​you can talk to the CSO Amex are very friendly if you can reach an arrangement with them then you can keep the card :) 0 comments0"
3,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Saw this question asked on the group also... Here is the simplified idea: The miles are directly credited to your KF account. ​Even if you don't renew the annual fee, the miles will still be in your account till it expired. However this defers for other cards such as CITI and DBS which allows you to rack up points (which needs to be converted to miles). Those may have a 2 year expiry!1 comment0"
