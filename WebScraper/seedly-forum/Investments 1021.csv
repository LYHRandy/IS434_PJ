God of WisdomAnswered on 08 Jun 2019Well if they are high earners and high savers and good investors, it's quite possible.If you managed to invest 50k a year for 7 years with a compounded growth of 12%, you'd have turned 350k capital into 500k. So if you're investing 80% of your income, you only need to earn 62.5k a year from age 23 to 30. Possible? Yes. Probable? Let's just say lots of things need to align.0 comments2"
2,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 09 Jun 2019It really is quite possible, but it really comes with earning a considerably high salary and being prudent.Consider if someone who has already saved 10k starts working from 23, and is putting aside say 6k a month. After 7 years, not including any returns from investing or bonuses, the saved sum alone would be $442k. Throw in bonuses on good years (in some industries in good times, people do get generous bonuses), and some sound investment returns (including 2% bank interest on that capital), and you would be at $500k.It takes prudence and discipline to get there. I agree with Hariz - it does take a couple of things to align.That said, everyone has their own life paths. I have met very wealthy people who are deeply unhappy despite living a luxurious life and sitting on substantial income generating assets, and also people who live very humbly and prudently, but always have the most heartwarming smiles. Having money is not an ends, but a means to a goal.1 comment1"

What I am baffled by sometimes, though, are the MLM guys or insurance agents who suddenly look like they are living the high life #ballerlife - and I'm wondering where that money came from + is the extravagance necessary"

Investing is not about comparing who has a bigger networth or portfolio. Just do your best, set your own target and go for it.If everyone starts comparing networth and portfolio, then there is no end. Someone will always have a bigger networth.0 comments0"
