question,"Credit Card Savings Bank Account Asked by AnonymousAsked on 29 Aug 2019What is the best saving account for freelancers?I'm moving from a full-time job to freelancing soon. Currently, I have the POSB Everyday Card + DBS Multiplier combination. I have 1 GIRO for telco (2 mobile numbers) and 1 GIRO for NTUC Plus! Membership. Is splitting the telco bill into 2 accounts (total 3 GIRO) and switching to UOB ONE Account + UOB ONE Card a better choice? Actually, does that works? If yes, which credit card should I go for? ONE Card/YOLO? I think I'm ok to spend $500 per month including the GIROs3 answersAnswerBump1"

MasterAnswered on 29 Aug 2019I'm also looking into getting UOB One Account + One Card for my freelancing because I do not have salary credit too.There is a hack of topping up your grab account and using it to pay for all kinds of bills (since AXS started accepting GrabPay). You may look into it :D0 comments1"

I would suggest you take the CIMB account since your Income might be unstable too to have the $500 1st tier spending every month for a quarter of a year at least.Also, the comparison of the bank accounts have been asked and replied to by many of the Seedly community here. You may search for related tags and read on it for more feedback. 1 comment0"
