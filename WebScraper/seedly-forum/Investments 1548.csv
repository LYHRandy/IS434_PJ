2,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 20 Apr 2019I've gotten a little bit into whisky, but that's honestly because I like to hold on to collector's items and have worked in DFS before, so I understand the underlying value behind a particular brand, age, barrel etc.Another one that I've gotten into actually is collector editions for games, untouched. I think that the value behind these game are based upon their scarcity, so I buy into their collector editions and sell them off at a auction after a few years. The value doesn't lie in the game itself, but the extra collector edition items that are within (figurines, cards, signatures) that are worth alot to the right man.But as with all these alternative investments, they aren't exactly very liquid, so you'll have to be prepared to hold them for some time without any transactions. But if you've got a passion for them, you wouldn't mind for these prized pieces to stay with you a while longer!0 comments0"
