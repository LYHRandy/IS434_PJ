1,"Yk LaiLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019It is minimum lot size to buy over SGX. But need to check if it is cost effective for the brokerage fee to buy esp. for penny stock. I have a friend whose strategy (trade, not investing) is to buy 7-8k for a stock to reduce the cost effect via iOCBC (brokerage fee = $25)2 comments2"
2,"Question Poster19 Nov 2018Yea but my point is that isn't it expensive to do so? shouldn't they buy more at once to overcome the transaction fees?Yk Lai20 Nov 20187-8k is the total amount ($) of the stock. $25 divided by $7-8k, is 0.0036 max added to the stock price. It is considered negligible, right?"

5,Question Poster19 Nov 2018Yea but my question is why don't people buy more? isn't it harder to overcome transaction fees by buying such a low amount?
6,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Nov 2018This is the minimum amount of shares that needs to be purchased when you buy through a broker. 1 lot equals 100 shares; used to be 1000 in the past. Sgx lowered the minimum lot size to allow more people to buy shares. There is a way to circumvent this requirement, and that is to buy the shares using a monthly investment program offered by brokers like maybank ke, ocbc and Philip securities. You will get odd number of shares, depending on the amount you out in. 0 comments1"
7,"Serene TohLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I do that for expensive shares. Totally understand it’s not cost effective. But it’s easier to get the foot in the door for a beginner.(Was brought up old school by parent who prefer freehold to 99 years, so was uncomfortable with concept of custodian accounts.)2 comments0"
8,"Question Poster19 Nov 2018so it's more for people to start going in? Serene Toh19 Nov 2018Prob. The starters that don’t have confidence but still want to try it out. When I started out, I saved $1000 per month and buy a stock every 2-3 months. So for expensive stocks, like DBS I can only afford 1 lots. Previously didn’t really like unit trust because other than the TOP 10 stocks I don’t know if they have the stock I’m interested in. But I’m recently starting to feel more inclined towards them."
9,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Nov 2018There are only a few people who would do this.1) To be able to own the stock. Jardine CC at $34.50. you need at least $3,450 just to buy 100 lots. Previously, it was $34,450 because minimum shares is 1,000.2) Traders. They trade small amounts to accumulate at different spots and it will be compiled as 1 trade for the day.3) To minimise commission. Some stocks are priced at $1. But to minimise commission, for most trades, you require stock price of $9,100 (for iOCBC) in order to pay only $25 (or 0.275%, whichever is higher). So people may enter 9,100 stocks to buy at $1.4) RSP (Regular Savings Plan), which may be able to enter into a trade, but mostly it is just to facilitate the buying of shares.0 comments0"
10,Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 13 Nov 2018It could be they are new and don't want to invest so much capital in one stock (uncertain) or just not enough funds to buy more lots. Not really a strategy per se since returns for 1 lot will be quite minimal.0 comments0
11,"Robin LimLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 13 Nov 2018That is probably due to the minimum lot size for normal brokerage. but will it be cost effective?you should try to understand why they buy only 100 shares. They might be using Rip, recurr investment plan etc PS. In Sgx, u can also buy 1 shar.0 comments0"
