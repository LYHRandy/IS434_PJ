1,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I'm not sure how you got such a ridiculously high housing loan to begin with. The highest one anyone should settle for is the HDB one 2.6%. And trust me, every 0.1% counts. The first thing I would do for you is negotiate and refinance a much lower rate, like 2% or less. It ultimately depends on your investing skill and discipline. Especially discipline, since investing for 30 years is not something every likes. But its very easy to beat 3%. So if you ask me personally, I would absolutely just invest the $100k. The interest may look high by not paying it off early but it would be nothing compared to compounding $100k for 30 years. With that kind of time horizon, I could also take a more aggressive position and make double digits annualized. In 30 years, your 100k at a 10% compounded rate - which is VERY doable...you'd have 1.745 million dollars.This would be on the basis that I don't intend to sell my house in the future. I can still take out a second mortgage on it later for even more income. Do let me know if I can help you further by messaging me below. https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.542 comments0"

I use the hypothetical figures for illustration purposes to show just how expensive housing loans are that not many are aware of (i.e. after 30 years, you would have repaid to the bank 130 - 150% of your loan quantum due to a seemingly harmless looking  2-3% p.a. interest p.a.)

... (more)Ernest Lin Yizhi06 Dec 2018Or for example, you really achieve +10% YoY on your $100K for 10 years, and you have ~$250K+... and you have to spend $150K+ at the 10th year, Thus, you are back to square one ($100K) so to speak......"
