God of WisdomUpdated on 24 Aug 2019Do check if they have any existing life insurance policies. That might be a place that have cash value or a means to pay for funeral expenses.Another way is for you to give them more allowance and possibly top up their CPF accounts.Lastly, if they're already making $600/mth, I think that's great. If they have the time, energy, and opportunity to find more income, it'll be an option, but if not, I think that $600 is already pretty decent.You should be the one giving them another stream of income through allowance. :)0 comments4"
