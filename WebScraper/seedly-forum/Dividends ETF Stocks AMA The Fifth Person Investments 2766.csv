1,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Feb 2019Risk can be managed via diversification. For example, say you have all your investment money in DBS. this exposes you to not only the global macroeconomic risks such as the Trade War between China and US that affects all companies, but also DBS's own industry specific and firm specific risk, such as a scandal regarding DBS's financial statements, or increase rules and regulations by the Central Bank of Singapore that leads to more stringent requirements for DBS's operations. The risk here that can be ""taken away"", or diversified away, are the industry and firm specific risk, as you add more and more stocks into your portfolio to make it more diversified and covering many different sectors of the Singapore economy. Adding more stocks does not mean getting more stocks from the banking industry (which will mean that industry risk still remains), but also adding stocks such as Starhub, CapitaLand Mall trust, Venture Corp etc. The ups of one firm in another industry covers the down of another firm, and so the deviation of returns you experience become more and more stable, until all the risk you are left with is the Global Macroeconomic risk that affects all companies, which cannot be diversified away. This is the crux behind the whole idea of risk management. Of course I am giving you a rather layman version of this, but that is why many people recommend investing in broad index funds and ETFs that purchase a broad variety of stocks that track the performance of a particular index, which are tied to the performance of the economy. Such an example of this is the STI in Singapore, which comprises of 30 of Singapore's largest companies.For someone who does not track his investments frequently, I suggest looking into perhaps an ETF that tracks a broad market cap weighted index, or a passive index fund that basically ""tags"" and tries to follow a benchmark index as closely as possible, providing generally respectable market returns. However, you must take note of the costs of management of such funds and ETFs, for such passive funds, low costs of management are essential in ensuring you are getting the best returns for your investments.If you would like to learn more about such concepts of index funds and indexing, might I suggest a book "" A little book of common sense investing"" by John C. Bogle, founder of the Vanguard Group, and is credited with the creation of the world's first mutual fund. I have gained much insight regarding index funds from there!0 comments8"

MasterAnswered on 18 Feb 2019Diversify your investments, make sure you have your insurance ready, have an emergency fund ready before you invest and only invest money you can afford to lose, dont borrow money to invest or do leverage. You can invest in global etfs like IWDA or VWRD regularly. You should go for growth first if you are still young. You dont have to track regularly but do your research properly. Dividends are not the most important factor when you invest. Example starhub who gives 9% interest but share price dropping and they are borrowing money to pay dividends to shareholders. 0 comments2"
3,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Feb 2019There are quite a number of articles contributed by Seedly and other members regarding your question so I would just give a short answer to your question.In terms of risk management, I would suggest the following things:Having a rainy day fund of at least 6 to 12 months of your income/expensesGet yourself adequately insured: Health/hospitalisation Insurance, Life Insurance, Disability income InsuranceKeep a diversified portfolio. Diversified over different industries, geographical regions etcAs for ETFs, it depends on which ETF you are talking about as there are ETFs that cover specific markets like STI & S&P500 SPY, or even sector/geographic specific ETF. ETFs may be a good source of diversifying your portfolio and may suit your passive/hands-off investment strategy. Depending on your current age and life stage cycle, focussing on dividend/passive income may not be suitable for you at this point in time. If you are in your 20s, 30s, i would suggest that you focus on capital appreciation as a key priority. Feel free to drop me a PM if you would like to have a more detailed chat on this.https://brandanchen.manulife.sg/0 comments1"
4,"Victor Chng, Co-Founder at Fifth Person Pte LtdLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 19 Feb 2019Hi, I managed risk by having a diversify portfolio. Investing is a game of probability. Let say you want to invest in 10 stocks, make sure you allocate equal percentage to each stocks. If 5 stocks make 100% and 5 stocks lose 50%, as a portfolio level you still make money because of probability. 0 comments0"
