This means you can only get charged if the transferer hire a lawyer and do a claim from you via a court order. However, if the amount is not substantial, lawyer fees are not gonna be worth it.​Most likely, the bank will try to contact you and do a phone confirmation with you or what not (depending on their verification procedure) to get you to agree to return the money. Any trasnfer that has been effected and successfully transfered cannot be recalled without the account holder's consent, even if it was done on mistake.​That said, please return the money because you may not know how much the person really needs the money. By not returning, it makes you no different from those scammers cheating hard-earned monies.0 comments4"

A civil lawsuit can develop though and no judgement here but we never know what's the money for and I wouldn't be able to live with it knowing if someone could have died from not having these money.. you know.​An example from the pay for reference.https://www.straitstimes.com/forum/letters-in-print/legal-to-keep-mistakenly-wired-funds​​​0 comments0"

You are not responsible for the transferor's error - but you ARE responsible for spending money you know very well is not yours. Like picking up someone's wallet and spending the money in it.0 comments0"

Idk about being charged, but if i alr saw that a transfer was made to me wrongly, i would alr be using my phone. So since I'm on my phone, it's quite easy to transfer back. So why not just do it?0 comments0"

WizardAnswered on 10 Aug 2018Here's what I found online... a really interesting problem and unique in today's ePayment world - PayNow, PayLah, PayAnyone.​Indeed, a wire transfer (for us it's like FAST or bank transfers), in most cases, cannot be reversed. Some fraudulent wire transfers made from accounts, which do not have the funds on them, can be called off by the bank. ​Legitimate wire transfers (like the one someone makes to you), definitely, cannot be recalled.0 comments0"
