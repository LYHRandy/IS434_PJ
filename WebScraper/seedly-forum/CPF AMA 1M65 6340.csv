1,"Loo Cheng Chuan, Founder at 1M65 MovementLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Nov 2018This might sounds surprising to you: it is precisely the illiquidity of the CPF schemes that make it good. Many young aspiring investors didnâ€™t realise that it is precisely the ease of buying, selling and withdrawals of other liquid investment that cause you to underperform financially. Solid Long term investors would buy good assets and hold them for very Long term. And the more illiquid an asset is, the more possible it is to harness the power of compounding to snowball your wealth.
It takes guts and conviction, but .... hey, I did it. So can you! 0 comments7"

3,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 05 Nov 2018Yes infact I advocate it, but maybe no need 'so much money'.You will earned a guaranteed rate of 4%. For the first $60k in your CPF combined balance (with only up to $20k max from OA), the monies will earn an extra 1%. Since you are still young, u will not be near the limit yet. Thus it is worthwhile to topup to earn effective 5% return. Risk-free, regardless of market conditions.In additional u will receive tax relief for the topped up amount. Eg, your taxable income is $40k, for every dollar u earn above 40k is taxed at 7%. Therefore, if u topped up $1000 into your special account, u get $1000 tax relief, u saved 7% of $1000 = $70 tax money. Effectively have gotten 7% return on your money, in additional u will earn 4%-5% interest yearly guaranteed. In future, when your income increases, your tax savings will be higher.chat me up on my fb if u like to discuss futher.0 comments0"
