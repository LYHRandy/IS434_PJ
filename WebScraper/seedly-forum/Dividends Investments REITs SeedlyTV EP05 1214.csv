I will use it to reinvest into the counters when opportunity arises. You might want to explore a bit into other markets such as etfs, bond funds to balance out your portfolio.0 comments0"

Slowly as years goes by , the effect of compounding will surely grow it into a sizeable amount. So for now just treat it as a discount in your expenses from time to time.0 comments0"

Remember the compounding curve. This is just the begining. Jia you.0 comments0"
