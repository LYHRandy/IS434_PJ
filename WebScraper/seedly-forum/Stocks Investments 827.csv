God of WisdomAnswered on 17 Jul 2019If you have direct crediting service, the dividends will be credited on the payment date so you should see it reflected in your bank account on the next day.Foreign shares will probably be credited to your brokerage account so do give your broker a couple of days to process.0 comments3"
