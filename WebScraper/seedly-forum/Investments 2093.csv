1,"Ang Han WeiLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 08 Jun 2019I will hold off for now. Even though it is a business that is familiar to most Singaporeans, and we would likely have experience with SS from a customer's perspective, I have some concerns...1) Unsustainable Growth Strategy
The strategy of pursuing growh from opening more stores is unlikely to be sustainable if it means opening more of the same types of stores they have currently.
This is limited by the (small) size of theocal market, compounded by the presence of other brick & mortar competitors going after similar group of target customers. It is a matter of time stores get close enough to canibalise sales from one another. Groceries are commodities, and hence sensitive to prices. If I have 3 shops selling the same thing that I need within 5min walking distance, I will just go to the lowest price provider.2) Store layout and management
The stores differentiate themselves from other groceries providers by having separate dry and wet segments. I think this segregation works well with the senior generation, and the population of this bracket is shrinking. It can work for now, but management should use this time to revamp their stores to cater to the next generation of customers, which is the people currently in the 30's or 40's.3) Venture into online sales
This can be a good way for SS to address the concerns highlighted in 2). However, I am able to discern how well their online strategy will be executed currently. Online sales can give them an opportunity to get the younger demographics on board, with low upfront costs since the infrastructure to support the newly acquired customers are largey in place.4) Uncertainty in Overseas Expansion
The recent foray into China has not produced any results to cheer about. This was probably a way to mitigate effects of concerns highlighted in 1). However the overall strategy and the execution of it has not been convincing thus far. Chinese customers may also require some time to switch from their grocercies incumbents to SS.Until I see some signs of that, I am watching this stock, but prefer to stay on the sideline. The current valuation is not cheap enough for me to bear the above uncertainties.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 22 Mar 2019Honestly speaking though sheng siong's current venture into China has actually net a loss from it's beginning of operations in mid 2017, there still remains good upside in Sheng Siong's stock price - it can be easily be majority derived from the growth in revenue from their aggressive expansion in Singapore. In 2018 the Sheng Siong group opened a record number of stores - 10 to be precise, and closed down 2 in Woodlands and at the Verge. This means that Sheng siong currently has huge plans to expand while not being afraid to stop operations of lagging locations - very good signs for the future. Their 4th quarter gross margins even after opening 10 new stores have only decreased by 0.4% from 27.5% to 27.1%,  meaning that these expansions aren't doing badly either to substantially affect gross profit margins. So all these factors contribute to strong growth and good future upside just merely looking at Singapore's market. Hence, I am quite bullish on SS actually, I might actually pick them up soon!0 comments0"
