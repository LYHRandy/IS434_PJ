1,"Christopher Tan, Executive Director at MoneyOwl Private limitedLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Jan 2019Hi anonymous, thank you for your question and sorry for the late reply. Unfortunately, you do need to open a CDP account if you want to buy an ETF that is listed on SGX that tracks the S&P500 index. If you want to buy it off oversea exchanges, there are factors you need to consider and this has been highlighted below by other memebers. All the best!0 comments1"
2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Jan 2019Besides Stanchart, you can consider using TD Ameritrade or interactive brokers for buying into US based equities. SPY would be a very popular Etf that tracks the S&P500. IB can also allow you to access London stock exchange if you wish to access the Irish domiciled etfs mentioned0 comments0"
3,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Jan 2019There are things you should know before investing. Singaporeans gets charged a 30% withholding tax on the dividend for US shares and etfs. By investing in ireland domiciled etf from the london stock exchange, you can reduce the withholding tax to 15%. There are also accumulated dividend etfs in london stock exchange where dividends are reinvested into the fund that will increase the price of the etf (it does not increase the amount of shares you hold). CSPX is one example you can buy from london stock exchange that tracks S&P 500. You can buy using standard chartered. If you really still want  to buy from US, you can still consider standard chartered and buy IVV or VOO etf. Buying stocks outside of SG does not require CDP account because all of them will be placed under a custodian account.0 comments0"
