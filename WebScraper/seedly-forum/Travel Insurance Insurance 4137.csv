1,"Ck ChaiLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 27 Aug 2018Company bought travel insurance is most likely to cover for biz trip only and coverage may be limited.  I'll usually buy single trip travel insurance for my own personal trip, in fact, I'll purchase own travel insurance for biz trip at times, depending on the location and duration.  Nowadays we can often get discounted rates due to competition and promotion for travel insurance which is much more affordable.

If use company name, you might not get much back. However, some single trip personal travel insurance are affordable (because of competitive market) so I would just add on. ​Unless the work you take part in overseas is high risk (i.e diving, military). ​$100 for much much more coverage is not too much. Think of the persons receiving the payouts if unfortunate events do unfortunately occur. 0 comments0"

Also oftentimes to reduce costs, the company travel insurance are purchased by blocks and not per name based on typical number of people travels on biz per year. eg out of 100 total employees, only estimate 10 people travel often, so the travel insurance only cover 10 headcounts on a year regardless the names. 0 comments0"
