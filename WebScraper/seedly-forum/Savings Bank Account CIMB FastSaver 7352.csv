WizardUpdated on 25 Jul 2019As a student, I am assuming you do not have a job currently.If that assumption is right, then CIMB fastsaver is the better choice. Because POSB SAYE requires salary crediting and you only earn the higher interest on the amount you deposit into SAYE account.  https://www.posb.com.sg/personal/deposits/savings-accounts/saye
CIMB fastsaver is a no frills 1% interest if you have at least 1k.3 comments2"
3,"See all 3 comments Gabriel Tham22 Jul 2019Yea, I think CIMB is still better here. Because for POSB SAYE, only the amount you transfer into the SAYE will get the bonus 2% interest. Let's say you earn 1.5k and you put $500 into SAYE, you get interest for that $500. If you make withdrawal within 24 months of opening from this SAYE, you will not be eligible for the bonus interest. 

To prevent lock ups, just go for CIMB.Question Poster25 Jul 2019Thank You!"
