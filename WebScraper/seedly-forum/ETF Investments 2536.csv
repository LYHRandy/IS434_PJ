1,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Mar 2019There are people who really are capable of beating the market so they stock pick for more returns. Some will argue that US is at its peak and some will say investing in S&P 500 is not diversified enough for them. I think even the NASDAQ 100 is much better than our STI ETF although it will be more volatile. Once again, some will argue favour heavily on the top few like Apple, Microsoft and so on. But they are much bigger companies than DBS, OCBC, UOB and again more diversified than STI ETF. Everyone have their preference and think differently, just find the one that you are comfortable with the most.0 comments0"
2,"Ivann FokLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 03 Mar 2019Because there is a behavioural bias called the lottery effect where people generally enjoy picking stocks as though they are 4D tickets. They end up picking flashy stocks where they might win big even though the probability of that big win is very small. This is happens even among professional fund managers in active funds where they take huge, concentrated positions in their portfolio. As a result, many of them end up going bust. An estimated 90% of active fund managers can’t beat the market.Sure, these people could be one of the 10% who beats the market. But honestly, it’s not worth the risk because company specific risk is not rewarded by the market. I prefer to diversify my portfolio and reduce the risk of any single stock destroying my life savings. In doing so I’m already beating 90% of active managers out there.0 comments0"
