1,"Clarence Chua, Financial Planning Specialist at Prudential Assurance SingaporeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterUpdated on 09 Jul 2019You should always get your insurance set up first.
Because of the unknown that can happen. A simple way to set up your priorities for finance in order is a CSI concept. (Coverage, Savings, investment.)Let‚Äôs say something happens in one year time, 1k into insurance can give you 500k. 
Even if you were to put 10k into investment, you will need 500x or 5000% in return to get the 500k. Set up a firm foundation then build your tower. üëçüèª1 comment4"

At least get your hospitalization plan settled and purchase CI cover for about 5X of your annual income as coverage.Then only invest after setting aside 6 months of your expenses behind as emergency cash.2 comments3"
4,"William Ng22 Apr 2019How do we determine the CI coverage? Let‚Äôs say someone is at the last stage of cancer.Hariz Arthur Maloy22 Apr 2019CI coverage should be around 5X their annual income. This is for replacing the income loss due to inability to work. For treatment, your hospitalization plan should cover about 90% of all costs."
5,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Apr 2019Always INSURANCE first because insurance forms the baseline of any form of financial planning.Like what Hariz mentioned, make sure that your parents did purchase health insurance for you!Thereafter, speak to a financial advisor that is abe to consolidate all your policies to show you the coverage that you have. From there, make sure you are adequately covered for ECI (1-2x annual income) and CI (3 - 5X annual income)0 comments2"

WizardAnswered on 22 Apr 2019Insurance first (Defence first)  because it's your basic protections, after that only go offence (investment). Find out from your parents what's the policy they bought for you, get the details from the agent. Follow this guide to sort out the insurance.

WonderkidAnswered on 23 Apr 20193 stages of Financial Planning:1) Manage your cash flow & establish an emergency fund2) Protect yourself against financial risk (Insurance)3) Invest a portion of your monthly surplusIt has to be in this order. It doesn't make sense otherwise.Regarding the policies that your parents may have taken up for you. Check on what these are. In my opinion, if these policies are endowments they do not count as protection against financial risks as they are designed as saving tools.0 comments1"
