question,"Career Education Asked by AnonymousAsked on 21 Jul 2019Which business school should i go for my undergraduate studies? What should i do?I was offered by all three local business schools but am really uncertain which school i should go for. Each uni has its own unique selling point and that makes it even more difficult. NUS has its own prestige, NTU offers a 3 year programme, while SMU offers graduates with a higher pay in the workforce. I really want to experience hostel life too, therefore, I am incline towards NUS and NTU but at the same time i do want to receive a higher pay cheque when i am in the workforce.1 answerAnswerBump0"

I think a better way to understand this would be: which one would you be willing to pay the costs ie which downsides are you willing to bear:NTU: compressed timeline, so everything is a rush. NUS: Being ""Stuck"" in school for too long as compared to your NTU peers SMU: Competitive, no hall.
With regards to the paycheck, I would like to tell you that skills and experience matter more than your cert: For the same company, I have first class honours friends who were unable to secure even an interview while my 2nd lower friend were able to get the job, thanks to his internship experience.0 comments0"
