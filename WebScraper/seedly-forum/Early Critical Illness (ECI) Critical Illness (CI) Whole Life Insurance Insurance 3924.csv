God of WisdomAnswered on 25 Feb 2019To answer your question, you need to look at the total coverage you require.The rule of thumb is around 10 X your Annual Income in the event of Death and 5 X your Annual Income in the event of Illness.Top up accordingly. However, I suggest to skip on the CI coverage provided by the Mindef Aviva Group Term plan as premiums change as you age and their ECI list of conditions covered is not comprehensive. 0 comments1"
