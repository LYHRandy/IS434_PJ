The yield is likely to be higher...But you should probably invest in a diversified portfolio instead, where you can make 7%+ instead of 4%+ from an annuity. Investing is my specialty. If you're interested in making more money early, you can always drop me a message and we can talk about it. https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
