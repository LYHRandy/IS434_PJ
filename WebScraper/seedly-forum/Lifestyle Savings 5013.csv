question,"Lifestyle Savings Asked by AnonymousAsked on 18 Dec 2018I'm currently paying $44/month for a 3gb data plan on Singtel. I can only recontract in late May. Should I recontract now and pay the early recontract fee of ($240), and enjoy Singtel's promotion of 10gb data for $20/month?I want to switch over to a SIM only plan ($20/month) I'll be saving $24/month too. Note: I can only use Singtel as there is only Singtel coverage at my workplace.3 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Leong Wen Fong, Community Lead at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Dec 2018How much are you paying on this current plan? (including the money you pay for exceeding the data usage)If all the numbers you provide are ""nett"" numbers (which I doubt, because you havent factored in caller ID and all these)Then it's not worth it to change now. If you change plan you save:$24/month for 5 months = $120BUT this $120 is significantly lesser than the $240 penalty you have to pay for the early recontract. Thus you are paying more than you are saving.0 comments4"
2,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 19 Dec 2018Agree with Wen Fong! Based on the numbers that you have provided, you'll be spending more than you'll save. I'm in the same situation as you now, stuck with StarHub until May 2019 on a SIM+phone contract with 6GB of data (3GB + Plus 3). Since I don't have enough data and my phone is dual-sim, I got an additional SIM card from Circles.Life ($0 Flexi Plan) for more data. It comes with 1GB of data and can add $8 for 1GB or $12 for 2GB.In your case, you can consider Zero1's 1GB to unlimited plan since it leverages SingTel's network.0 comments1"

ProdigyAnswered on 19 Dec 2018It doesn't make sense to pay for the penalty if you are just using only 3 GB per month.Unless you exceed your data usuage limit and paying each month extra of $48 & more on top of your basic plan, then it is worthwhile to do the switch...Alternatively, consider to get another line for personal use.0 comments0"
