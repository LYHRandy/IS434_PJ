1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Mar 2019For me it varies. I would set it based on how risky this investment is and volatile this stock has been performing. If I am going long on a stock I believe fundamentally in the long term horizon of 5 years, I probably would not set a stop loss. I would set notifications if the stock falls below 5% and probably look to increase my holdings further.For higher risk investments like options trading or short term plays, I would typically set a stop loss of about 6-8%.0 comments0"
