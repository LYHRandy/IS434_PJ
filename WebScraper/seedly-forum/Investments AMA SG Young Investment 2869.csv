1,"Luke Ho, Venture Capitalist at CFXLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Sep 2018Historically speaking you wait another 12 years (looking at you, Straits Times Index) or 10 years (MSCI Emerging Markets). Quite frankly speaking, the 40 - 50% statement you made is an assumption. For 2008, in efficient markets it was like 50 - 60%. If you were in an efficient market fund, it was more like 20 - 30%. For EMs, there were 75% drops. ​Generally most people prepare for this kind of volatility ANYWAY when they invest. Means you're likely yielding your annualized yield DESPITE these market downturns. All you can really do to prepare is the same as any other way you mitigate risk.​1) Diversification: Proper diversification, not just randomly in different places. The standard deviation should be lower and the sectors should be greater for roughly the same yield (best case scenario)​2) Dollar Cost Averaging: Not really my thing because historically it yields lower than lump sum investing, but its a great way to manage risk.​3) Defensive instruments: E.g. Commodities, Bonds. Ugh. I don't even want to touch this, unless you're very old and you're worried about this. If you're above 50, contact me and I'll help you rebalance your portfolio. If you're younger than 40, stick with the equities but make sure you peg it to a purpose - like retirement - and just don't sell beyond a mix of historical and personal threshold. Otherwise, you'll buy high and sell low like 90% of the clowns who try and fail at investing. ​I specialize in investing. You can always drop me a PM, if you'd like my help, being the FA that I am.​https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.54​​​​0 comments2"

Assuming you're still below 40, you'll have time to watch your portfolio ride back up over the course of a decade or two. Then when you reach about 50ish you can move some of that into less volatile bonds.0 comments1"
