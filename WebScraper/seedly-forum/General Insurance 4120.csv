MasterAnswered on 10 Sep 2018To be honest I haven't really considered personal cyber insurance before because such insurances were often for commercial entities; not individuals. Cyber crimes are very real and frankly speaking with the technology now an anti-virus, anti-spyware etc. ain't enough anymore.​I just looked through and find that actually Etiqa's one could be a good policy if you're concerned (please always observe good surfing pratice too) because it's only at $6.70/mth to secure all your equipments + your family members who are living with you who are Singaporeans. ​Imagine something happen and you'd have to pay for it first (because banks usually need time to investigate) and you're needed to take time off to settle the administrative work. Time off = money. Transport = money. To get things done there are processing fees such as document replacements and all these costs money too. ​Consider if you're a low or high SES persona and what is the impact if something like this were to happen to you. Would you be prepared to pay for $6.70 a month to feel safe? I know some people who don't believe in the product itself so it's up to you.​There are a few companies who have similar policies for your references here.AXA: https://www.axa.com.sg/pdf/our_solutions/cyber-risks/cyber-protector/cyber_protector_fact_sheet.pdfAt $234/annum vs Etiqa's $80/annum, it covers up to 50,000/yr (each time max 25k).​AIG also has one but cyber extortion is on extension only. https://www.aig.com.sg/business/business-products-and-services/financial-lines/cyber-insurance0​Hope this helps!0 comments0"
