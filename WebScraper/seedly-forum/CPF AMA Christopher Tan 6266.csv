question,"CPF AMA Christopher Tan Asked by AnonymousAsked on 24 Jan 2019What's your thoughts on topping up your CPF SA account?I am split about whether to top up SA account. The interest rate for SA will be at 4% but the cons will be that I can only withdraw the amount at the age of 55 (provided I have sufficient FRS amount in my SA account). The interest accrued from 55 to 65 will also not be allowed to be withdrawn. The pros will be it can help me with tax savings. If I were to purchase annuity plan, it can give around 4% too and I can decide when I want to withdrawn. Of course, the cons is it's non-guaranteed.1 answerAnswerBump0"

1,"Christopher Tan, Executive Director at MoneyOwl Private limitedLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Dear anonymous, thank you for your question and sorry for the late reply.Firstly, if you intend to top up your SA using cash, it must be because it is for retirement planning and not because of the tax savings. Because topping up your CPF SA comes with an opportunity cost.There are 3 ""things"" you will need in retirement:A fully paid house A good medical expense insuranceA lifellong income streamUnder lifelong income stream, CPF LIFE forms the foundation. It gives you a reliable income stream that hedges against longevity and market volatility risk. By contributing into your CPF now, you are actually accumulating towards a lump sum to buy this annuity (CPF LIFE) at age 65. So if you have excess cash and if your SA has not reach $176K this year, it might be a good idea to use your SA to accumulate towards this lump sum of buying CPF LIFE later.Hope this helps.1 comment1"
