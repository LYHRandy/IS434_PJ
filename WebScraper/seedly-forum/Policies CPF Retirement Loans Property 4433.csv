MasterAnswered on 11 Oct 2018You can invest your OA into Funds or ETFs, where you should typically expect a range of 5 - 10% annualized (otherwise it wouldn't be worth investing them). ​I do offer these options, so you can always nudge me here if you want to look at funds that have this kind of performance. ​https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.54 ​​0 comments1"
