question,"Investments Savings General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 04 Oct 2018I'm in my 20s and I have some emergency cash stashed aside. My plan is to save up a separate sum of money just for investing, Am I being too prudent?If I were to save up a separate sum of money just for investing, it would take some time before I can invest in stocks. Would the opportunity cost be worth it? I'm also keen in taking up some SSBs to meet the investment criteria for my DBS multiplier account so my cash flow is limited for the next couple of months .... What do you guys think?4 answersAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 04 Oct 2018Do try to keep a 3-6 months of your salary as your emergency fund before investing into higher risk assets.This is just to make sure you have something that's safe and available if you were to lose your job, get injured, or fall sick for an extended period of time.Being prudent is good. Wealth accumulation is a slow and boring process. You'll also feel much better taking on higher risks in your investments if you know you have a rainy day fund. 0 comments2"

Note that all investments carry risks and thus, only invest with money that you can afford to lose and diversify your portfolio to minimise the rise. You can take up SSB to meet the investment criteria to earn additional interest since SSB is safe and provides decent returns, killing 2 birds with 1 stone0 comments1"

To me, this was the most straightforward way to park aside a bit of money(rather passively) for investing because having only just graduated, I was low on financial responsibility and cutting back on spending was not an issue for me then.Perhaps have a look at what your expenses are like and if you aren't able to tighten your budgeting/cashflow, then come up with a slow but steady plan to save without compromising too much on cashflow - it WILL take a while longer to obtain an ideal amount for investing, but you should eventually reach your goal. Jia you!0 comments1"

Some are aggresive and some are conservative in investing. Just take your time and learn about investments and see which suits you more. I had no idea SSBs will meet investment criteria, learn new things everyday haha :D Just do your best and plan it out, starting soon is better than starting in your 30s or 40s or never start at all.0 comments0"
