Since SRS withdrawal is pegged to retirement age, similar to CPF style, then it would be better to top up CPF to your maximum.If after topping up CPF to the max, and you still have alot of income tax to offset, then use SRS.Top up CPF and top up SRS both give tax relief but CPF has better interest rates and no taxation upon withdrawal.If you meant that the 200k is currently savings and have no income tax to offset, then you might want to consider Singapore savings bond. Max allocation is 200k per person with better than bank interest rates. Good liquidity, 1 month withdrawal notice and pro-rated interest upon withdrawal.0 comments0"
