How do I convince him that there's no benefits to it, and he can better spend the money elsewhere?I've already tried using the ""how much you can save if you were not smoking"" method, but it didn't work.

1,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 24 Dec 2018Most of my bro who smoke smokes 1 pack a day at least. Their GF also ask them to quit or reduce but they ain't listening.  Those who don't quit had a character of avoiding or running away from serious topic or things they don't like to deal with. So it's not a logic or sense that we could talk them into or out of it.  I suppose it really depends on you if you wanna stay with him,  know that this character traits stays until he is more mature or faces something dire then only willing to change. Otherwise he could be like this forever since nothing really make him determine enough to wanna quit smoking. if you do wanna stay with him , then find one day very seriously discuss future with him. Know that it's very hard to quit smoke for heavy smoker. Share that you will be there together with him and help him quit step by step every step of the way. Remember , being angry or scolding or nagging only chase a guy to escape from reality and lie. Only true love, acceptance and support allow him to felt safe to reveal his trueself to you and willing to appreciate, go thru life's thunderstorms, thick and thins and stay together. All the best to you guys ðŸ˜Š0 comments3"

WonderkidAnswered on 24 Dec 2018Take this time to really consider if your boyfriend is someone whom you want to spend the rest of your life with.You should not even think of accepting his habit. If he places you in priority and definitely knows that smoking is harmful to the people around him especially you deemed as his loved one, he will try to kick his habit. This kind of prove that he doesn't love you enough. I'm sorry for the direct way of saying this matter but I have gone through one narcissistic relationship and current real love relationship to tell you this.0 comments2"

GeniusAnswered on 24 Dec 2018It is good that you are mature enough to think about the financial aspects of the relationship, but remember, there is no perfect man/woman.find out why he smokes. Is it because of work, stress, habit, etc etc. Also, see if he can find a substitute. Remember, men and women are programmed differently.0 comments2"
