question,"Investments Savings Asked by AnonymousAsked on 13 Jul 2019How does a 25 year old save and invest? I am currently only earning about 3.5k and my bf and i recently managed to secure a BTO successfully.?However, our monthly repayment is pretty high (approx $2.5k per month). My take home is only $2700. And my bf and I are most likely going to split the repayment which means i would be paying $1.25k per month and that leaves me with $1.5k per month. Minusing my expenses, i would be left would $800 per month.. how do i invest with $800 only? Not to mention i need to save a portion of the $800 for rainy days....

God of WisdomUpdated on 13 Jul 2019I don't wanna be too harsh but you may be buying a too expensive house.It's 550k++?Your home should only cost between 5-7X of your combined annual income.If y'all make 2.7k each. That's 65k a year and at max should only be buying a 450k house. Preferably a 325k house. I suggest earning a higher income to compensate for the home purchase. Now, if let's say you can only invest 800 a month, that's way more than enough to start a globally diversified portfolio. Save 6 months of your income aside for emergency, so about 15k before investing everything after that.2 comments2"

Thanks for the advice anw!Hariz Arthur Maloy13 Jul 2019If he makes more, you guys may want to discuss paying the loan in accordance to your earning, not sure how much you guys want to combine in terms of income and wealth. It's a discussion you need to have. After that just make sure you have your emergency fund set aside first. Only invest after that is settled."

Hospitalisation and Personal Accident Insurance. 
Mortgage Insurance. 
Home Contents Insurance. 
Life and Critical Illness Insurance (once you have dependants e.g. old parents or children). Also, at the same time, keep a healthy sum as emergency funds in a high yielding interest account (maybe DBS Multiplier). Just imagine if you're suddenly retrenched, so how much money you would need to survive til you get a new job. After all these, then your cash is called spare. With the spare cash, you can divide into 3 parts. 
1) Short term investment 
2) Mid term investment (E.g. children needs) 
3) Long term investment (E.g. retirement) Short term. You can consider maximising your high yielding saving account. For the risk taker, you can try purchase crowdfunds. Mid term. You can consider Endowments. If you don't mind DIY you can purchase unit trusts or ETFs. Long term. You should consider Maximising your CPF SA, by transferring from OA or cash top up. Just some basic guidelines, further information are found all over the Web. If all these not possible, although not recommended, just buy a ILP but please don't buy ILP as your first choice.1 comment1"

The prices in hdb resale market is going down with the massive number of new btos popping up.
Our generation will never see the profits like our parents did. We have to work smarter and be proactive in looking for new opportunities while accepting the hard truth that we have it worse. Looks like you have to bite the bullet and burn the deposit. The numbers you wrote don't make sense.
Remember an owner occupied house is not an asset, it drains money from your pocket. Best of luck.3 comments1"

Reno costs, monthly bills, property tax, etc. Less your income and evaluate whether there is enough wiggle room for investments, holidays, children. You cannot hope for a future profit on sale or a salary increment, a bird in hand is worth more than 2 in the bush.Jefremy Juari13 Jul 2019For the case of investments - when you're young, focus on learning the markets and accumulating your funds in an inflation resistant asset, e.g. Gold. A figure of a $1000 a month would be good, giving you $60k at year 5, assuming 0% currency inflation. Be warned in 2018 our inflation was as high as 10% in some sectors, and we are facing negative growth. The civil service has already restructured in a preemptive action to the economic climate. Don't catch falling knives, work with what you have."
