Just that your end will capital gain tax. ​This wil give a basic idea: https://www.asiapropertyhq.com/buying-commercial-property-malaysia/​Best to just go to any properties house that sells industrial properties in Jb and go in as a interested customer and ask them about the buying and then selling process to gather more info.​Huat ah! :) 0 comments0"
