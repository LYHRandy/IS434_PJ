1,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019If u are refering to physical gold, buy ONLY investment grade bullion. They are easily recognised and can be easily traded.Go for gold coins like american eagle or canadian maple leaves. Personally I prefer the canadian maple leaves as they are beautiful and the purest at 99999 fineness.Just google silver bullion u can find several dealers in singapore. One example is www.silverbullion.com.sg , their retail office is inside CertisCisco at paya lebar. Whatever u buy , Just be mindful of the current spot price of gold/silver. And the premium u pay above spot price for the bullion.You might want to consider silver too. 1 comment2"
