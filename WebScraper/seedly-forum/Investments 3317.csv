1,"Png Cheng Xi Damien, Happy Life Seeker at HomeLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Observe the stock market. If the peaks are getting lower and lower without any sign of rebound above the previous peak, it may mean that the market is bearish. That said, bearish market doesn't equal to bearish every stock. Certain industries can still be bullish in a bearish market. Same goes for companies too. Well-managed companies usually perform regardless of market conditions.1 comment3"
