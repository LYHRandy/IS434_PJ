Unfortunately there is no shortcut to life and nobody can point you in the one direction that you would absolutely excel in.What's ""good"" is in fact what's ""good for you"". And since we're not you, we won't know your preferences, habits, quirks, personality etc. Only you know all these. It is never too late to start anew. And if you're unhappy where you are now, it is probably worth it to start anew. You say you have no strong passion in anything, but then why are you questioning your career now? You must have some preferences that are not met at your current position. Take some time to reflect on your preferences and find job opportunities that match your preferences. They may come from various industries, and that's ok. Apply for those jobs, go for all the interviews you're called up for. Ask all the questions you want to see if your personality is a good fit.Finding something good for you could take some time. If you have commitments like a spouse, a property and/or children, you will have to seek support from your family as you go on this journey. Also give each job opportunity some time. You may not start off doing what you like, but over time you might like what you do. All the best!0 comments4"

We see 80's grannies go study in Uni to complete her degree.We see Jap grannies do IOS programming do coding for apps and gamesWe see our very own SG grannies play rock guitar at NDP! So, it's never too late! :) ​No relevant experience ? Nevermind.No passion ? Nevermind. Any industry that you like or interested in, will be a good start. ​Sales experience is what you need ultimately. This is becaus businses establish for the sole purpose of making $ (heck, even non-profit also have to make $ to do good). So every business will need sales person, someone who gather leads, make transactions happens. A company can survive without A/C, IT, Manager, Admin, Finance but a company can never survive without Sales!  Even a startup or co - founder first skill is to know how to pitch to investor (which is SALES!) ​So go ahead and go thru linkedin, glassdoor and the job site , go network and talk to people. They would surely appreciate someone who can make sales happen! ​0 comments1"

It's the same for people in their mid careers doing a career switch. Find something you will enjoy (even if you are not passionate about it) so that work will not just be ""work"" per se. All the best! :)0 comments1"
6,"Pascal Samsoon, MBA Candidate at Singapore Management UniversityLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Nov 2018Never too late. I started many times from scratch. I might start again in a few years. It might not be the most perfect career strategy but it is a risk to take. On to some pieces of advice...Some great starters...Start by mapping out what motivates you (money? fun? friendship? ownership? long list...)Understand what are the behaviours that suit you (your strengths, your skills, your personality...)Maybe, look at where you are now and where you want to be in 5, 10, 20 years time...From all of the above 3 points, develop your strategy...""The only person who knows what is right for you is you"" With regard to industry. Since you are not passionate about any specific industry, focused on your skillsets and intrinsinc motivations to find roles that could suit you. From there on, you could end up in a few industries. Join one and figure out along the way how to excel in that industry before moving to a new industry...Hope it helpsPascal from Time to first byte0 comments1"

8,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 27 Sep 2018It is never to late to start a career. But with no relevant work experience, you may have to take a big pay cut. If you are young and single at 28, you may want to take a gamble. But if you are older and married with a family, you may have to seriously consider. Even if you could go hungry, your wife and children still need to eat. A family man has to shoulder the responsibility of ensuring the family is well taken of even if you seek a career change. This is my humble opinion. Hope it helps. 0 comments0"

10,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 27 Sep 2018Not too late. I started around your age in the financial sales industry as well. Decided its not my cup of tea and went into financial operations instead. Maybe you can consider a similar route since you have this background?  Ultimately you need to see what you are good at and start from there. Doesn't have to be your passion. Who knows? You may find your passion after you land a role. All the best. 0 comments0"
