1,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Either is fine. I've been very vocal about my dislike for the STI ETF in particular, but you're not going to be an NSF forever. And assuming you don't intend to use your investments to pay for uni fees, at least it will roll for a couple of years until you have a job. Good for you. When you have a job, look for something that yields higher or has better dividends, which I can offer you easily.  https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.542 comments0"
