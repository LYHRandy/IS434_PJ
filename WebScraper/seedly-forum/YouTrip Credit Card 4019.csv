1,"NNNicholas NbxLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 23 Aug 2019So far I saw YouTrip is specifically excluded from Citibank and UOB card. But it worked for Standard Chartered Unlimited Cashback. I've tried and gotten 1.5% cashback on all my YouTrip top-ups with that card, at least at the of time of this post. Hope it helps!0 comments1"

In addition, unsure true or not, you might still be able to get 0.5% to 1% rebates.0 comments0"

There are no perks for topping up to a preloaded credit card and even if there are, most banks do not acknowledge topups as a criteria to earn rewards. Mostly expenditures do.0 comments0"
