God of WisdomUpdated on 20 Jul 2019Instead of investing your 30K savings, secure your job first, and grow your human capital. Analyse your expenses and ensure 6 months of liquid cash in a bank account. Only the amount in excess of that should be invested, and even so, only after you have settled your insurance.But to answer the questions you posed: My goal is to help clients grow their wealth in absolute terms. It's as simple as that. For clients who need our help, we have various portfolios and solutions so it does need a little bit of discussion to see which solution fits them. Charges range from 0.5% to 1.5% p.a. But ultimately the charges are not the key thing. What's important is the net return to you, the investor.And for clients who are familiar with investments or prefer to manage their own, our POEMS platform will allow them to access a multi asset multi market environment where they can invest and manage on their own.In the end it's a matter of choice and preference. Whether you want to do it on your own, or with the help of an advisor, I can offer both.0 comments6"

Naively, he asked where all the customers' yachts were? Of course, none of the customers could afford yachts, even though they dutifully followed the advice of their bankers and brokers.
Just subsitute the bankers and brokers with insurance agents.1 comment3"
3,"Fergus Tan22 Jul 2019Well, I think this is biased and coloured. 

For example, a relationship manager in the bank dealing with entry level HNW (ie, treasures/premier/privilege/priority/etc) are dealing with clients who has $300k in the bank, but their total portfolio of clients is $100mil worth. Usually they would have about 300 clients, and maybe 20% would be actively investing.

I charge lesser for clients who are also my insurance clients.I suggest speaking to an Independent Financial Advisor Rep and asking them about their investment methodology and planning. I discuss with my clients about asset allocation, diversification, accumulating and distributing strategies, and portfolio shifts as we move into different parts of our lives.What you want is also an advisor that can generate above market returns or similar market returns with lower risk taken or reduced volatility. If you'd like to understand how I provide investment advisory, drop me a message on Facebook or an email. Hariz.maloy@promiseland.com.sg0 comments2"
5,"Fergus TanLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 22 Jul 2019There are many types of financial services representatives. You have stock brokers (or formally called trading representatives), you have financial adviser representatives (which can market insurance, unit trusts, alternative investments), you have robo advisory (which essentially invests in ETFs most of the time, though there are some doing a hybrid human-robo model).
My suggestion is to shop around. Talk to a few people. Don't feel pressured to buy anything.There is a difference between a tied representative from an insurance company, a tied employee from a bank, and a representative from a financial advisory firm. If you are looking purely for investments,  you can probably skip the rep from insurance company, and the employee from the bank. Unless you just want to get some insights.
I don't know if you have covered your protection needs, or how savvy you are on holistic financial education. Hence, the best is really to talk to a few people. Don't feel like you owe them anything if you think their philosophy and style differs from your own.In everything, there are always pros and cons. Be it a human financial advisor, a robo advisor, or diy investment. Understand the pros and cons and make a choice thereafter.Most FA firms in Singapore are pretty okay. It's really the individual representative you want to take note of, and not necessarily the firm.2 comments0"

7,"Harvey TanLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 20 Jul 2019Hi there It would served you better to read a couple of investment books first.
Recommendationsa) The Intelligent Investor - Ben Grahamb) The litte book of common sense investing - John Boglec) A random walk down wall street - Burton MalkielIt will serve you well in the long run.It all boils down to probabilities. Contrary to popular beliefs, the probability of you picking an advisor that can contruct a portfolio that outperform the market is slim to none, which as good as the probability of the active manager picking winning stocks in the long run, to generate consistent alpha. You are better with index funds. But if you are adventurous, there is no serious damage if you allocate 10%-15% to active funds.0 comments0"
