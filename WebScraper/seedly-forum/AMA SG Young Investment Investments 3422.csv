1,"Soh Sing Heng, Financial Blogger at SG Young InvestmentLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019For stocks, you might want to try out stocks cafe. This platform will calculate all your stock returns automatically for you. For SSB, you just have to take the coupon paid to you as your investment return. â€‹Asset allocation depends on individual risk appetite. For young people below age 40, I would think a portfolio of mainly stocks is good for long term investments. For those above 50, it would be better to invest in safer assets such as bonds or stable dividend stocks. 1 comment1"
