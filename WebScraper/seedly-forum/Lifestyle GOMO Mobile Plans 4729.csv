WonderkidAnswered on 30 Jul 2019Well I am Using GoMo and I think the offside is when you want  travel, it is not worth to pump the value in for oversea data although you could get the  Gomo oversea Sim card but still I don't think it is worth. Other than  that, data speed is good but I don't monitor the speed and it is debited from your account to save you the hassleof paying bills..0 comments2"
