It's a great platform, with a robust charting system built in. Yet simple to use. Fees are decent, more so if you are part of a community which negotiated with TD for cheaper comms (I'm getting min USD 5 per trade for stock). They also do not charge inactivity or custodian or live data feed fees, which is the case with other brokers. Do note that TD only allows access to US market, so if you want to get involved in other markets and only want to use one single platform, Interactive Brokers may be a better idea. They do have higher funding requirements, and some of the fees I mentioned above will be applicable.0 comments0"
