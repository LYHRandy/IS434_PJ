MasterAnswered on 02 May 2018Some things to note if your stocks are under a custodian: Your stock purchase was not bought under your nameYou will not be invited to the Annual General Meetings, unless you make a request way beforehandYou would not be notified of any rights issue or share buy back, basically any announcement by the companySome hefty and hidden management costsSome things to note if your stocks are under a CDP: If your stocks are in your CDP, you have the freedom of choice to use any broker to make a transaction.The opposite of all of the above, except that CDP does charge some fee to your brokerage (if I am not wrong!)But if you're not planning to be much of an active investor like me, just transfer it to your CDP! Hope this helps!0 comments1"
2,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 02 May 2018If you are paying custodian fees, I would suggest you transfer to CDP to save on the long term fees for holding shares.â€‹If your custodian account does not charge fees, then there isn't really a need to transfer out. The only difference between CDP and custodian account is that you get direct ownership of the shares, any corporate events such as AGM/EGM will directly address you. For custodian account, you have to request to go for AGM/EGM and they may have quotas shared among other custodian shareholders.0 comments0"
