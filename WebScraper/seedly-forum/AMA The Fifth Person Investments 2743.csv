1,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 19 Feb 2019When recession happens, you should invest even more. Prices are going down and if you do your research, you can get good stocks at a discounted prices that usually you cant get. Look at companies that have the ability to handle the recession. Although you should have a plan on how much to invest when recession happens like maybe 30% drop you invest 25% of your cash on hand, 50% drop you invest another 25% something like that. Bonds and commodities is to reduce your portfolio risk and volatility. It may makes you feel better that you lose lesser money compared to others during recession. Its up to you though some people are perfectly okay with the stocks going like a rollercoaster and continue to hold them.0 comments2"

Though it may seem very intuitive to exit the market completely in times of recession, it is also in recessions that many performing stocks become undervalued as emotional investors exit too quickly and impulsively without assessing the possibility of a likely comeback. However, timing the market and exiting just before the crash is no easy feat - in fact not many can do so consistently and profitably over long periods of time. Hence, if you are just a rather new investor, much research points to the age old ""buy and hold"" strategy - where you invest into an index tracking ETF or fund and hold onto the investment for an indefinite period of time. Of course, this means that your investment value falls during period of recession, but generally growth of economies are on a uptrend - this means eventually, your investment will still grow, albeit at a rather modest rate at the market return. Another method is dollar cost averaging - where you essentially invest set amounts at set timings regardless of market performance. So instead of locking all your investments into a set number of shares, you are able to buy more when the share prices fall, and less when prices rise. You average out the price of the share over the period of time that you invest, disregarding market timing. Such a method is also possible for beginning investors who are not confident in timing markets, but wish to be involved in investments still, and regularly contribute to investing.0 comments1"

Therefore, investing more during recessions would make more send than investing more when the economy is peaking. Of course, whether they are good stocks or bad stocks, you'll have to evaluate them yourself. Also bear in mind that you should have some money set aside for rainy days!0 comments0"
