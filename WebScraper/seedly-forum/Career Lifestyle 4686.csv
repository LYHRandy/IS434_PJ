1,"Jacqueline YanLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 23 Aug 2019I'm not at a masters level yet as I am pursuing a part-time bachelor's degree, but I assume it will definitely be more vigorous.
Working full-time while studying part-time is downright tiring. It involves sacrificing time that you'd have spent with your family and friends, sometimes even your hobby.
If for some reason, you tend to end work late or have late meetings, rushing to school can take a toll on your mental capacity to be attentive in class.
Plus, I'm not sure if the same applies for masters, I find that some of my modules are very touch-and-go. Like for example, maybe a full time degree would let students run a 'real' campaign for a public relations module? But for us, it was just on paper.
If I had the chance to start over and have enough finances to fund a full time programme without having to work, I'd take it.
Good luck though!0 comments3"

Especially with all the rushing from work to school. As with most things, a compromise is necessary.However, if you do have an understanding boss, work out an arrangement that suits you! Could be part time work or telecommuting, either way, it alleviates the stress of studying part time while working full time.3 comments3"
3,"See all 3 comments Pat20 Aug 2019Enough to cover cost fees + 3 years of living expenses (this sounds crazy but rly you need the additional year of expenses as a buffer just in case you don’t find a job immediately upon masters grad). This is assuming you don't work part time, hence the high savings. I do think there is time for part time jobs and will recommend tuition hahah but if you can continue your current job on a part time basis I say do it for job security upon grad. :)Pat19 Aug 2019I’m assuming you currently have a full time job ahh but honestly if you don’t it is ok! Look out for job opportunities months before your masters graduation if you can :)"

Pros of Full Time:Ability to focus fully on doing your masters. Speaking from personal experience, it is not easy given the number of papers to read and write, along with group work in some cases. Imagine if you were doing it part-time but cannot dedicate the full-focus it requires, some eventually drop-out due to no time and bad grades. Defeats the purpose of getting a masters. Would highly recommend full-time IF you have enough savings and investments giving a good yield to tide you through those 2 years. It is possible to juggle both a masters and a job that provides flexibility, but usually rare.Cons of Full Time:The opportunity cost of income in the 2 years doing full-time masters could be detrimental to some, especially for those who don't have adequate savings. IF for whatever reason you are doing a full-time masters, and procrastinate all the way, then GG. Not only do you not earn income, but you are also wasting money on a masters where you are not learning.0 comments1"

I study part-time while working, it's actually a bit hard to cope especially during assignment/presentation/exam period. If your finances allow, you can go ahead with 2 years full time, so you can fully focus on study. Got Pros and Cons lah.0 comments1"
6,"AAAmi AtmLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 18 Aug 2019If you have enough savings and budget and you are in millennials, I would suggest going for full time.I studied 2.5 years to study part time back in 2012 . It was an exhausting schedule, especially since I worked in IT and had to rush projects, from both school and work. You probably have no time for vacation, social or immediate family. Time invested mainly is for team projects, research, self-study and preparation rather than course timing. I believe 2 years cost less than 4 years at your school?Few people drop out halfway due to family commitment in my class even for 2.5 yrs. We need the grit to finish through what we started and clarity of why you want Master degree.2 comments1"
7,"Question Poster17 Aug 2019Thx for answering! How much emergency savings do you think I should save up before studying masters full time and will I have time to take up part time jobs?AAAmi Atm18 Aug 2019Obviously Course Fee + 
Simplify living expenses for 2.5 years + 
if you have family obligations to your parent for 2.5 years 
If I were you, I would still go for part time freelancing for some income and exposure ."

I took two years off to do full time, classes were between 8 am to 6 pm (not all the way). More or less like when I was in polytechnic. Maybe around 20-24 hours week plus discussions with group mates. I would say I was relatively hardworking. I took up tuition like 4-6 students (12 hours or so) which were enough for me and mum’s allowance too and a bit of travelling to nearby countries once or twice a year.0 comments0"
