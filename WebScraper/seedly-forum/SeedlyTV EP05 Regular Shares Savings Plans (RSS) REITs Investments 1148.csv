1,"Ashley Wong, Financial Assistant at Multi Management & Future SolutionsLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 24 May 2019Investing in REITs is similar to trading shares on the stock exchange. For trading and investing in best REITs, you must hold 2 accounts namely: SGX CDP account and Brokerage Account. If you are already investing in shares and trading on stock exchange then investing in REITs Singapore will be a cakewalk for you.0 comments0"
