1,"Yinghua LiuLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 30 Jun 2019You can set up 2 standing instructions from your bank to transfer on 15th & 29th. (Do note that it will take them some time for the amount to be reflected.)If you have multiple portfolios, the money from each transfer will be spilt to the different portfolios accordingly.0 comments0"
