Yesterday, I have read a blog Top 5 Singapore Stocks to Buy Now! and it contains Singtel in their list of stocks. As per my analysis it is alost near to it low for this year and as we know that It has potential to give good return on investment. ​​0 comments1"

Or income?​From a fundamental perspective, I feel that the dividend is very much sustainable and it can be a good income stock for the dividend investor. Growth wise, not that much.​A key question for you is whether you think competition is going to be as bad as what people think its going to be, and if 5% yield is enough for you to stomach the volatility.​FYI I'm vested in Singtel, but do your own due diligence before you buy.0 comments1"

Or is it a price war?​Is it still a viable business?​Are its overseas expansions viable and makes sense?​Can it sustain the dividends payout?​If you buy now, are you able to tolerate further drops in its share price?​These are only a few questions to ask yourself before buying, got alot more questions but I lazy type all....0 comments0"
