God of WisdomUpdated on 17 Jun 2019Get him to go through all the pros and cons to switching. Most of the time, you'll be losing out on cancelling and re purchasing a new insurance policy.However, if he really puts in the work and you'll be better off with the new policy, then why not consider. But before you commit, ask a 3rd party to analyse his pros and cons listed and see if its valid.1 comment9"

3,"Huang Yixuan, Product Designer at SomewhereLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 21 Jun 2019I understand how you feel!! Happened to me last year also. Just started working and my friend (okay actually not really close but we hang around in a group sometimes) asked me out to talk about insurance and I felt bad to say no. But only afterwards I realised he didn't actually take the time to talk to me to understand my needs, but only just generically tried to sell me a whole life insurance. And when the insurance underwriters rejected my application due to my exisiting health conditions, he tried to push me to get an endowment plan instead. Now I just ignore him when he texts me cause he was just too pushy and I don't think he actually cared bout my welfare.I think when you realise that your friend is using the ""friend card"" to guilt trip you into buying insurance for him, you need to decide if he is really your friend and if he is somebody you want to keep in your life. These things can show their true colours. Hope you manage to siam this!3 comments8"

I've had my fare share with such but I've met some good ones too and since the products are generally similar (varies according to your personal needs), I got it from a close friend who wasn't pushy at all. Hope you find a good one to help manage your health and wealth! :)"
5,"Samuel ChinLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 21 Jun 2019If you really are not interested, be honest and open with him that you don‚Äôt want to discuss about it. If he appreciates the friendship I‚Äôm sure he will understand.
If you‚Äòre curious and don‚Äôt mind listening, let him know too, that you‚Äôre just knowing more. See what he has to offer and make sure he doesn‚Äôt sugar coat the whole one with only benefits.2 comments6"
6,"Edward Boon Sun Shee21 Jun 2019Yup i stand by honesty as the best policy. Because if you really don‚Äôt want, no one can force you to do so. Keeping the friendship is more important than spoiling the relationship. Because at the end of the day, there‚Äôs so many people out there needing help for their financial portfolio so reject politely lor if you really not keen to buy. If the person is really pushy then no choice don‚Äôt waste your time.Allison Chan21 Jun 2019I totally agree"
7,"Jennifer GohLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 14 Jun 2019While a straight no is the most effective way to cut the topic short, I can imagine the rest of the conversation will be quite awkward...In that case...Indirect no...by saying something like 'you need some time to think about investing an insurance as you've some other responsibilities and priorities...'If he/she persists, they're not respecting the friendship and they don't deserve your time coz a true friend will understand and stop bugging you about it :)0 comments6"
8,"Charmaine Ng, The Value Maximizer at @ Every Ma La Xiang Guo StallLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 15 Jun 2019Since you already know you have no intention to switch; just tell him straight no that at this stage you have no intention to switch and that you'd like to keep it that way. If he tries relentlessly, let him know what products you have and ask him for his recommendations. If his recommendations truly help to complement your current portfolio; consider it. If it doesn't and/or is just asking you to switch over for sake of his sales, decline and tell him that you value him as a friend and would like to help but no because he doesn't value you likewise.He should stop bothering you after that.0 comments3"
9,"Alan KorLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 16 Jun 2019Just say no and if he is persistent, ask him to pay for the product which you will buy from him2 comments3"
10,Kenneth Lou16 Jun 2019DeleteEditLol. üò±what a move. @Alan KorCharmaine Ng16 Jun 2019But that is a very effective move to be used on the last straw. For anyone who's reading it and if your friend agrees please sign a contract with them. (Thumb print works best)
11,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusUpdated on 14 Jun 2019Why not just say you would like to remain good friends? And that if he / she should respect that. And that you do not want to risk losing friendship if things sour.Show him / her this message.If you ask me, insurance / financial products make / break friendships as bad as a joint trip in Japan.There is too much conflict, and you may let friendship cloud your judgment. A lot of times, you may trust your friend more and skip reading those lines in the contract. And when you do later, and find out you have been ****ed, all hell breaks loose. So no, just no.0 comments3"
12,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 14 Jun 2019Well, I also had this situation before. At the end, before signing, I thought carefully and said I am not interested to sign the policies.0 comments3"
13,"Joseph Sng, Chief Curator at CurateXX AsiaLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 22 Jun 2019Check with him the reasons for asking you to switch, perhaps there is some cost-saving or additional coverage, which he did it out of real good intention for u?0 comments2"
14,"Steph Yeo, Auntie Uncle Whisperer at Agency for Integrated CareLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 21 Jun 20192 cases to share:1) aquantaince in uni asked to meet up for lunch to chat. In a separate uni clique a few of us have also been approached so i know what she wants. I told her directly that all my insurance needs are alr taken care of by an agent that looks at my whole family, but if she wants to meet up to chat or to practise her pitch I'm ok. So we just met up for lunch and chatted about random things in uni. Did not talk about insurance at all. And also never spoke or met ever again. 2) jc friend asked to meet for dinner to catch up. Treated this case somewhat different because she was a friend, not just an aquantaince. Met, chatted, eventually diverted to insurance but same thing i said i had a family agent. And it so happened that anyway she was working for the same company so she didnt continue trying to sell me anything. Now she still keeps in contact for promos from the insurance company. I think lesson learnt from these 2 cases is to set the tone right from the beginning. If you don't give them the hope that you'll become a client then they'll most likely leave you alone.0 comments2"
15,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 23 Jun 2019If a 'friend' shows up out of the blue after months or years of not keeping in touch with the sole intention to sell you an insurance product, I would re-evaluate my relationship with said friend. But jokes aside and if he's a good buddy, then it makes sense to listen to him.
Even if you are not looking to switch as he's said, you can look at other ways to support him for eg. helping him refine his sales pitch and recommending him to your friends, provided you feel that he has his clients best interests at heart.
I have an insurance agent that sends me the occasional message on, hey what if you get an accident/die/etc etc - do you want to buy this additional coverage. Needless to say, I have bought other insurance policies from more well meaning insurance agents.0 comments1"
16,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Jun 2019Just be honest and say you don't see a need to switch now, but appreciate his thoughts and that you'd keep him in mind if you decide to switch one day! :)0 comments1"
17,"Joash ChuaLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 22 Jun 2019At the end of the day, no one can possibly put a gun to your head and make you say ‚Äúyes‚Äù to any recommendation - just remember that you are always in control of the final decision.
As for the suitability of the recommendation, it‚Äôs more subjective than it seems. In fact, looking at this on a product level is too myopic. You should take a big step back and look at this from a much wider perspective.
1) Is the advisor competent? As far as I‚Äôm concerned, a financial consultant needs to actually understand financial concepts. If you go to a licensed doctor to be treated for ailments, then there‚Äôs no reason to be suckered into buying dubious health products frm a door-to-door salesman.
2) Is the advisor emphatic and a good listener? If he starts the meeting talking about a product without actually listening to you talk about your life and goals and fears, that‚Äôs a problem. Rule of thumb for the advisor - 70% listening 30% talking.
At the end of the day, there is a lot of information asymmetry (what the advisor knows vs what you don‚Äôt know) which can be used against you. It comes down to whether u feel he/she can be trusted.0 comments1"
18,"Allison ChanLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 21 Jun 2019Friend or no friend; no obligations to accept any or every proposals made. Just tell it plainly and honestly, be it not interested, not so much money,  no such need now, enough insurance already...etc. It's long term leh...dun want the friendship to go sour then must be honest upfront, rather than regret or hold grudges. If still friends after rejection then this is real friendship. Professional ones will handle rejections with no emotions involved.0 comments1"
19,"Farez OmarLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 21 Jun 2019If your friend truly had your welfare in mind, he would be more focused on the value that he can provide to you instead of merely trying to get you to switch agencies. Going through the pros and cons of switching first would be a good start. Else, I‚Äôd be skeptical too.
If you are adamant about not switching, honest with him and tell him you have no intention to switch. If he truly believes in putting your personal choice and welfare first, there should be no further reason to push for a switch (unless the costs of not switching is proven to be higher).0 comments1"
20,"Tina Sharon LeeLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 21 Jun 2019Best to be upfront and tell him that you are not switching. You can say that if you come across anyone looking to buy, you will send them his way.0 comments1"

22,"Cayson ChoongLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 21 Jun 2019I think the first thing you have to tell him is the reason why you do not want to switch. Maybe you're not comfortable with him or you already have an amazing advisor.Ultimately he's there to close a deal with you, if you're not interested or comfortable just let him know.And always, always educate yourself first before making decisions0 comments1"
