It will be hard to find statistic for all the 'critical illnesses', not even to mention claims experience from any of the insurers. If u want more narrow stats like children cancer, it will be easier. According to KKH, Children (under 15yo) makes up about 1% of all cancer cases in Singapore, about 90-100 new cases are detected each year. The cancers for children being:Leukaemia 35%Brain tumour 20%Lymphoma 10%Eye tumour 7%Kidney tumour 6%Adrenal tumour 5%Bone tumour 5%Germ cell tumour 5%0 comments0"
