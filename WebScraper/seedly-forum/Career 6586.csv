Maybe u can help your father to structure the business in such a way that it could be sold to someone else instead. Why fold if it could be sold? unless it is loss making..0 comments2"

Try to make him understand that you are currently enjoying and liking you job very much. Find out more about the business and try to map out the potential of which under your helm. Importantly, the two of you would have to determine together, whether it will be a legacy wasted if it isn't you that is taking over. I have a couple of friends give up their jobs in the creative and media industries to take over the family businesses that were totally unrelated. There isn't a right or wrong answer here. Lay out all the cards on the table, find the most logical and move forward with everyone's consent. Ultimately(and sometimes, unfortunately), given the culture we're in, it is still important to think of Family as a priority in the decisions we make. 0 comments0"
