1,"Ck ChaiLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 08 Jun 2018Not sure how much you know about the company.  When googled around, there isn't much info of the company.  And looking at their  corporate website profile, there is totally no mention of health products related biz under their biz stream. https://www.noblevici.com/about-us​Personally, I do not feel comfortable in investing, you may want to find out more of the company and consider the possible risk before jumping into investing.0 comments1"
2,Charmaine NgLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Jun 2018I've googled around and it seems there's no mention of healthcare products linked with the company.. what's more the company seems to be listed very recently with high votality. ​When investing I believe it's important to do your own homework; know what they are doing for sustainable growth and take a leap of faith if necessary.​Personally I'm not comfortable and would advise you not to but if you know them well personally and believe these are legit investments with sustainable growth then go for it. Also please do make sure the health products have gone through stringent quality checks and suitable for whoever is going to consume them. It is never worth it if you invest 10k for health products you will not be using.. do not let that be a bait.​https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/noble-vici-group-inc-otcmkts-043300369.html0 comments1

4,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Sep 2018How did you get to know of this companuy? Hot tip from a friend / family?  What can you hope to achieve from the purchase and holding of these health products/shares?  For non listed investments, I'd suggest staying far far away, unless you know the company inside out and are comfortable investing with them. Even then, invest only with funds that you are ok to lose, which you won't leave sleep over.​If you are new to investing, do read up materials available to get a sense of what investing entails, ask about the community here as well if you need help understanding. All the best.0 comments0"

WizardAnswered on 16 Sep 2018​It's very weird why health product ??? when over their homepage and fb says: ​We are the investment holding company of several leading fintech and analytic technology-related subsidiaries; consisting of research & development, market analytics and e-commerce.  We are distinctive in our abilities to develop integrated ecosystems leveraging Blockchain Technologies, supporting both business and consumer marketplaces.  Headquartered in Singapore and listed in America, our operations spans across Asia PacificI see them more of a fintech /blockchain investment company, like angel investors etc. I wouldn't brush them off too quickly. However, I wouldn't buy any health product from them at all, because it doesn't seems to be relate. Furthermore, 10k worth ??? (How long can it last ??) ​Can google and observe some time on what company did they actually invest in,  if those company has good product fundamentals, mostly could be fintech / blockchain, it will then for you to decide if want to invest in because the tech is still new and no sure of their execution capabilities to keep the startup that they invested in to becomes a decent company that will stays for long.  0 comments0"

8,Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018Don't think it's a wise decision to invest so much into this company and it's health products which you are unfamiliar with. Do also diversify your investments to minimise the risk taken 0 comments0
