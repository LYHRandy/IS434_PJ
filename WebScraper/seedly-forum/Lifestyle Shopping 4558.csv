I learnt a lot.I used to sell silver, gold coins online. but sales were bad, so I moved to cushions in Qoo10. I sold 1 cushion in 6 weeks.Yes. 1 cushion in 6 weeks.I asked this guy - Ecommerce Marketer to teach me some small skills.After 1 coffee, i went home and changed my Qoo10 listing, i sold my 2nd cushion in 2 days.Then I started selling manuka honey.Then I soon moved to adult diapers, elderly products, etc.Now I am in Amazon.Learn from the best.

You want to go and sign up a seller account first by going to their website, scroll down to the bottom on the desktop version and you should see a link that says sell on Qoo10. Follow the instructions there to sign up. You will need to buy SGD$100 worth of Q-cash(don't worry you will have use for it later) to have a seller account. Forget about the Q-store because it takes up $50 of the Q-cash and honestly doesn't help you to get more sales on Qoo10 at all.Secondly, once the account is setup, go to Promotions  Keyword Plus and type in the product ideas you have and look at the results. If there is a lot of searches, this product has demand. Now go into qoo10 consumer site, and search for the product as well, look at the number of competitors with 300 or more reviews. If there is more than 7 competitors selling that product with that many reviews I would skip and find another product idea to research on. Keep doing this until you find something worthwhile before you start selling.Lastly, once you find you product ideas, go ahead and order the inventory and start selling. Bid the top spot on your product keyword in keyword plus, and that should help your kick start your ecommerce career.For more tips you should join my Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/158010781507949/0 comments6"
