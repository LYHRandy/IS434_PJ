question,"Bank Account Savings Asked by AnonymousAsked on 22 Jan 2019What are the best savings accounts that don't require a salary deposit? Looking for something to complement the Bonus$aver.The Bonus$aver account is capped at 100K. Any funds beyond 100K are simply languishing. Are there any other savings accounts that don't require a salary deposit? The only one I could find is the Citibank MaxiGain tiered account which hits 2.2% after a full year.I'm looking for a savings account because of liquidity needs (buying a house, etc). Thanks and looking forward to your recommendations!3 answersAnswerBump1"
