question,"Revolut Multi Currency Cards DBS OCBC Asked by AnonymousAsked 3w agoWould Revolut be a good solution for transfer from JPY to SGD?I'm living in Japan and earning my salary in JPY but need to often send back money to DBS/OCBC account. Does it mean I need 2 Revolut accounts? (1 in JP, 1 in SG)? And does transfer out from Revolut card to DBS/OCBC incur any fees? Thanks a lot!1 answerAnswerBump0"
