question,"Salary CPF Asked by AnonymousAsked on 13 Jan 2019How do I calculate my tax relief for topping up my own CPF?Hi, I would like to clarify how does the tax relief calculation work. For example, first $40k pays a income tax of $550 and subsequent $40k is 7%. But what if I earn $41k(annual) for example and contribute $5k to my own CPF. Do i fall to the previous tier of first $30k pay $220 income tax and next $10k at 3.5%? Since $41k - $5k = $36k?1 answerAnswerBump0"
