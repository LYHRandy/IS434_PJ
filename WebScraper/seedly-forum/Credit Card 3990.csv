WonderkidAnswered on 06 Sep 2019I believe this is a workaround to utilize GrabPay credits for overseas transport rides, such as Indonesia, Malaysia or Thailand.In the local context, there is no use for the moment actually, as it is better off using the conventional credit card0 comments1"

MasterUpdated on 06 Sep 2019The benefit of the MasterCard is that you can get grab points from online shops that don't offer GrabPay as payment as for me I used it for Shopee. Currently UOB and Grab partner up so you can get up to 10% cashback using or top-up grab with the UOB One credit card. And you can get the 10x grab points compared to just using UOB one directly getting up to 5% cashback.0 comments0"
