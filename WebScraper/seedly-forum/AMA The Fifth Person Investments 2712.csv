MasterAnswered on 21 Feb 2019Start because you are comfortable and knowledgeable about investments and not because of your age. You should start learning about it and then start investing once you are comfortable. I would say primary school kids can learn about basic money and savings first. Secondary school can start to learn about basic personal finance stuff like CPF, SSBs, emergency fund, insurance and high interest savings account. Tertiary students can start to learn more about the different ways to invest and different types like REITs, value, growth, large cap, small cap, sectors and so on. Everyone is different in learning and dont have to set a specific age to start investing. In my opinion, start as early as possible when you have the knowledge, regular income and the basic things ready like insurances, emergency funds and savings accounts.Im a poly student and most of the classmates and frens dont even talk much about such things even when i try to start this type of conversation about finance and investments. I feel that it is important for them to know and discuss because we will be graduating this year on april and some friends from ITE alr started working.0 comments0"
