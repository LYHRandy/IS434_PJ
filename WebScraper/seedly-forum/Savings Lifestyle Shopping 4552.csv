5,"Heng Kai LeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 07 Jun 2019It isn’t exactly cashback but I recently downloaded this app called Milieu. You accumulate points by doing surveys. If you get enough points, you can either choose to exchange the points for cash or donate them to charities like Singapore Children’s Society. I donated my first 5,000 points to charity. Now very close to hitting 9,500 points so that I can use them to redeem $10 through PayNow. GrabPay and PayPal are other possibilities.my referral code, if you are inclined: NQW9W10 comments0"
6,"Jacq NgLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 05 Jun 2019Not an app but i've also tried rebate mango. (actually, i'm not sure if they have an app version.. heh) sometimes, there's a difference of 1-2% in terms of cashback by the same shops as compared to shopback. Still, shopback button helps to remind me to activate shopback so i usually go through shopback (while on desktop).0 comments0"
