question,"Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked on 18 Aug 2019What should I do when the way we split the bill with my friends bothers me?Hi, I usually dine out with my friends and I felt unfair when they readily offer to pay the bill first and the other would have to ""paynow"" the person who foot the bill. However, I felt I am at the losing end as the person footing the bill will get to enjoy card benefits ie. reward points while the others simply had to repay based on the actual bill. How do I solve this by not showing my displeasure to my friends?4 answersAnswerBump0"

Do you have a card that enjoys similar card benefits? Or you are just jealous that your friends are getting extra benefits from the card at the cost of you guys eating out?If you do, I presumed you are dining out with similar clique, maybe come to an agreement that each time you guys dine out, each person have the chance to pay the bill? Letâ€™s say tonight Friend A pay the bill; next time Friend B pay the bill, then it will soon be your turn to foot the bill? Or you can just tell them you would also want to enjoy your card benefits?0 comments1"

WonderkidAnswered on 21 Aug 2019Do you go for 2nd round or even 3rd round every time you dine with your friends and how often you dine with the same friends?If it is a different group every time then I think just let them enjoy the benefits (that is if you do not have a card that let you enjoy the benefits..)If you do have the card and dine with the same group of people, you could volunteer or make your way to pay the bill 1st and ask them to paynow u.Even if they show displeasure, just tell them you have a minimum spending to achieve to be able to waive your card or something, tactfully. If they are still displeased, maybe it would be best you don't dine with them anymore. 0 comments0"

Or you can just say you want to rewards so you would like to pay first. Usually, I just let them know and most people don't mind... especially if they are good friends!0 comments0"
