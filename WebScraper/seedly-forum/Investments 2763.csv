1,"Isaac Chan, Finance at NUS Business SchoolLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Here’s a quick response to your answer.Will I buy the shares? Not necessarily. Simply because millionaires decide to buy the shares does not mean that you should do it as well, since they may not be good investment decisions.Rather, you need to determine what would be an appropriate strategy for you, which depends on your investment goals, such as how long you want to hold an investment, or how much risk you are willing to take on. Your goals therefore should be your guiding principles in terms of your investments. However, you did present an interesting scenario here. If I were you, I would probably investigate if these shares are currently being undervalued, and if the share prices will increase over time, before making an investment.Share prices are always affected by the forces of Demand and Supply. If there is more demand than supply, then share prices will go up, and the converse will happen if demand is less than supply. Hence, we would need to analyse both demand and supply forces before forecasting whether share prices will go up or down. However, if in the scenario you provided, only demand for the shares increased by the purchase of shares by the millionaires, then share prices will go up if supply is constant.1 comment4"
2,"Question Poster14 Feb 2019Thank you for your reply. Will there be anything you would add if we are talking about a blue chip. And based on a year’s trending, the share price have somewhat stabilized at that range. "
3,"Lee Jin Fei AndreLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 14 Feb 2019What I could say is the other posters are right in their responses. Personally, I would follow, because higher buy volume is also a sign that people see additional value in the company's future hence they are buying now. It only makes sense, provided the company is stable and without any red flags, but you'll never know...More importantly, even if you followed, would you ever know when these millionaires are going to pull out their investment? If you can't tell, and don't pull out yours in time as well, I would say you're in the run to lose big. (Assuming the trades are legal and not any ploy for manipulation etc).0 comments1"

7,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Do you share the same line of thought that is compiling this group to purchase the shares? Even so, you need to do your own due diligence first. The big and regular purchases  may cause a big jump in share price, which may trigger an investigation by sgx. 2 comments0"
8,"Question Poster14 Feb 2019Thank you for your reply, putting law aside. If this fund is a blue chip fund will there be anything you would add? Jonathan Chia Guangrong15 Feb 2019I'll assume you are referring to a unit trust. If this is the case frankly I won't be able to advise much. Not sure if significant buying/selling into the fund will impact the nav much as I do not have the interest to evaluate funds other than to scrape part of the surface as part of my day job. "
