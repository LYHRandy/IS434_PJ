1,"Soon XiaohuiLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 08 Oct 2018hmm I used to be a hard core gamer haha. But I quit gaming after I decided to do something else. Something unknown about me, I have game development (programming/testing) background. I cant deny that it's always a gamer dream to do something related to gaming, which explains why I choose speciality in game development. Once a gamer, will always be a gamer. =)‚Äã‚Äã#gamerforlife (Make a guess what kinda of games I actually love to play~ definitely not maple story lol. )‚Äã‚ÄãOn serious note, In the past, there are little platforms for gamers to make income. Those who are paid are really rare, unless you're in s.kr, etc. It's easier if you are in a team too.However, with the up growing of e-sport, people started to build a career/income in it. And maybe you are not aware, this year, they made an announcement to give e-sport a trial & it may be included in future Olympic‚ÄãBut back in reality, we all do need an income to survive. I do understand your frustration. Here is some checklist for you to go through:‚ÄãWhat type of game is he playing?Did he record his games? Keep a result of his performance?Is he in any team or Did he sent his videos/result to any professional esports teams or sponsor??did he do anything to increase his presence/popularity in the game?‚Äãwhy I ask so, is because sometime, opportunities must be seeked. It doesn't come naturally. If he has done the above, look at it again. Is it possible to improve? Is it possible to find a sponsor??‚ÄãHowever I can't comment whether 2 year is a long or short period is because it is depending what type of games & its popularity. Popularity & the game potential are critical to sponsor(s)‚Äãbut as a couple, it is best to sit down & have a discussion on realistic timelines such by when, he should have a certain income coming in. And do remind to him gently, marriage is always about 2 people, it's a team work similar to gaming. Even if it is a solo game, you need to be on form to play/perform well, this applies to relationship too.‚Äãand if his game performance is not outstanding, do not discourage him but let himknows that he should at least try to build an income to support this gaming dream of his. in this way, it is easier to preserve on, and fighting to achieve what he has in mind for both of you (Idealistic & realistic)‚Äãwish you both all the best & hope to hear something good from you.‚Äã‚Äã0 comments3"
2,"Jay Tee, PC enthusiast at HomeLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Haha I‚Äôm a gamer too and twitch is huge. I mean amazon did buy twitch for 970mil. ‚ÄãHowever the people who actually ‚Äúmake it‚Äù on twitch are far and few in between. Those who barely make ends meet doing twitch full time are probably TOP 5% of streamers, and those who make good money are TOP 1% or less. ‚ÄãMy opinion: start twitch part-time first, when something substantial comes along then you might consider going full time.7 comments2"

4,"Leong Wen Fong, Economics and Management at University of LondonLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I won't say that twitch is an impossible dream. If gaming is his passion, and he can potentially do what he loves. Not trying to sound sexist here, nor am I promoting this, but (good looking) women do find it easier to find subscribers.‚ÄãTo be a good twitch streamer, there must be 2 main things that he must consider:‚Äã1. SkillThis sounds like an obvious thing - but really how good must you be? Take the game Overwatch for example. A quick google search tells us that there are 40 million players worldwide. Let's pretend only half of them play every day, or at least relatively often. That would bring us to 20 million. Most streamers with significant following come from the Top 500 of that region. That means that you must be in the top 2000/20,000,000 pool of skilled players, or top 0.1% of players. ‚ÄãThat being said, there are a handful of successful streamers that fall in the Diamond-Masters range. (Ranks from lowest, go like this: bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond, masters, grandmasters/Top500)So how do these people gain subscribers? It brings us to the 2nd thing to consider, which is‚Äã2. CharismaNeither is said to be more important than the other. I have seen not-as-skilled players with a good following, very skilled players who are not as vocal, and players that are both skilled and have great contentIf he wants to practise, he can take short videos of himself, or watch his own streams. Or if he can bring you a portion of his stream, and you don't fall asleep watching it, then it's a good start.‚Äã(By now you can tell that I like gaming haha)‚ÄãI can understand how the lack of income would frustrate you, but why not use this chance to learn to create some passive income through investments, so that you can (very slightly) alleviate your worries. In any case, I do feel that your husband should at least take up a part-time job to support himself, as he tries to realise his dream of a streamer.5 comments2"

6,Nicholas ChanLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Oct 2018Show him the statistics on how many actually made it to become millionaires doing that. Then help him to see where he stands among the top players & whether his dream is realistic 0 comments2
7,"Elsa GohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 08 Oct 2018Mmm if he would have made it big he would have done so already. Can tell he is stuck in inertia. Ask him what caused him to leave his last job, it may be an underlying fear holding him back. If so, let him ease back into working world by choosing a different job.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 06 Oct 2018I think it's normal to be very concerned; my gf now wife was the same when I was out of job for a while (she wanted security).. That said, my personal opinion is that this should be considered a side line, unless your hubby is really good and has a big following, with endorsements and sponsorship. Till he gets to this stage, best to get a day job that pays the bills. Hope this helps 0 comments1"
9,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered on 06 Oct 2018Hey Anon, I'm sure you're pretty worried about the situation.‚ÄãYour husband needs to know that he needs to treat Streaming on Twitch as a business. And he and his entertainment value is the product.‚ÄãThis means that you need a business strategy. Which will include marketing plans, financial plans, how to track progress, allow for feedback, and milestones. ‚ÄãIt can be a job, but it must be treated like one. ‚ÄãAnd he needs to prepare all this and convince you, his investor. Because while he's not working you've been funding his ""growth"". Well guess what, investors now wanting some ROI back before pumping fresh funds. ‚ÄãAll the best. Link his twitch ID, I don't mind checking him out.0 comments1"
10,"Rave Ong Ci DeLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 08 Oct 2018Hi there, ‚ÄãI would say these are a few options/considerations. ‚ÄãFirst, what are the types of games he plays, ie. fast paced like FPS(First Person Shooter), or slower paced RPG(Role Playing Game). Next, does he chase after games, like doing pre-order of games? Also, what platform does he usually use, i.e Xbox, Playstation, Mobile or computer? Does he buy the DLC(Downloadable content)?‚Äã‚ÄãReason why I asked all these is to decide which Platform suits him better. Either a) Twitch, which requires him to Multi-task(something which guys suffer at), bring his A-game, every game, keep his emotions in check, i.e. Don't throw tantrums when he loses. Twitch is more of an Active income, Orb) YouTube. I have seen gamers who do Twitch (Live Streaming), and then, edit the clips and post to YouTube. If he can get at least 1000 subscribers, he can have the option to monetise his video, i.e. you know those annoying advertisements when you watch a video halfway? Those ads help the video uploaders make money. YouTube is much more friendlier to non-competitive players, such as those making guides, or walkthrough of the games, or even review. YouTube is more of your passive income, as long as your video is up and people watch the advertisements(or leave the video to stream while doing something else). I have seen people who do very old games, such as Old School Runescape which is a 2008 MMORPG (Massive Multi-Player Online Role Playing Game).‚ÄãAnyway, have a talk with him and don't assume he is not going anywhere. For all you know, he could have gotten somewhere decent, but is aiming for better. Hopefully, this will give him options and if he does not make it, at least he would have no regrets. ‚Äã0 comments0"
11,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 08 Oct 2018I think he might be addicted to gaming....this is a serious mental issue of addiction. You might want to get him to attend counselling to rid his addiction first.‚ÄãThere is passion for gaming and there is gaming addiction.....0 comments0"
12,"Tee-Ming Chew, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 08 Oct 2018I think no matter what passion, there should be a fixed duration where the person can try to make it happen. 2 years in my opinion is long and if he hasn't shown anything yet, then maybe it's time for him to move on.‚ÄãPerhaps you can talk to him and set goals/deadlines for him to achieve? Once the goals/deadlines are not met, then he has to move on to something else.‚ÄãAll the best!0 comments0"
13,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 06 Oct 2018Haha. Able to last 2 years play games everyday without concern for cost of living or retirement, then must have substantial savings. ‚ÄãNevertheless, research about success or failure case about twitch gamer making it. There is. But not many. ‚ÄãWhy not show him the research results , if is good then support him. ‚ÄãIf is mostly failure case , then ask him what's his plan to make it a successful career. ‚ÄãSupport his plan and help him to plan. If he make it good for your family, if it doesn't then he will come to his senses and find other things to do.
‚Äã This way, at least he has tried and won't regret later. ‚ÄãTalk to him about it. Try üòÑ0 comments0"
