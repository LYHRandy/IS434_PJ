God of WisdomAnswered 3w agoBoth are world indexes (ETFs) but from different fund houses, so they will largely perform the same. However, it is important to note the currency risk as both trade in USD on LSE. On the surface, a quick glance shows that they have between 1.6K and 3+K holdings, so diversification is good. I would expect that returns will closely mirror the MSCI world. Fund size wise, both are relatively large.0 comments2"
