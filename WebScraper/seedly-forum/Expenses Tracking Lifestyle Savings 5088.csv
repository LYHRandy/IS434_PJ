MasterAnswered on 12 Nov 2018I think until Go Jek comes in, there is littel we can do for this.If you take grab often, then accumulate points to get the higer grab vouchers, because simple calculatio s show that the higher the value of the vouvher, the less points you need to use for each dollareg. 2x $5 grab voucher needs 4000 points1x $10 grab voucher only needs 3800 pointsSo it's more worth it to wait and redeem a big amount!Shopback also give cashback for taking grab! though it's only 20cents, but the amount can really add up if you take many small trips!0 comments2"
