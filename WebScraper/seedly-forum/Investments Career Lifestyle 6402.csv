WizardAnswered on 23 Jun 2019Straight from IRAS:All payments and benefits derived from the carrying on of blogging, advertising and any other activity performed on social media platforms as a trade or business constitute gains or profits from a trade or a business under section 10(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act (ITA). Payments in exchange for services performed by bloggers/social media influencers can take the form of money, goods or services. All monetary and non-monetary payments / benefitsin-kind are taxable if they are received in return for services rendered or to be rendered by bloggers/social media influencers. Any benefit whether monetary or in-kind provided to the families and friends of bloggers/social media influencers will be taxable on the bloggers/social media influencers.  The following are excluded in terms of declaration:Bloggers/social media influencers will not be required to declare non-monetary benefits if the following two conditions are met: (a) The product/service is given to them on an ad-hoc basis for one-off consumption or testing; and (b) The value of each product/service received does not exceed $100. If the value of the product/service exceeds $100, the full value of the benefit should be declared and be subjected to tax. The $100 threshold does not apply to non-monetary benefits received by bloggers/social media influencers if it is a recurring supply provided over a period of time Source: https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/uploadedFiles/IRASHome/Businesses/Social%20Media%20Influencer.pdf0 comments2"

WizardAnswered on 24 Jun 2019Well, since you already put it out in public and ask, then yes you need to declare such income.Freelancers, grab drivers, grab food, also need to declare. So, do keep a record of all your income and business expenses, then file your taxes as well as tax relief.0 comments0"
