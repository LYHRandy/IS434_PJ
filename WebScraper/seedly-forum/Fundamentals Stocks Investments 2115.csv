2,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Mar 2019Hello!One of the most common investment strategy for a beginnner would be to invest in ETFs. This is usually done by investing about $100 each month and can be done through regular savings plan that are usually offered by banks. This is a passive form of investment wher you do not need to do constant monitoring of the markets thus making it suitable for beginners who may not have much knowledge about investing and how the markets work.Another alternative form of investment for beginners would be investing in SSB, which are singapore savings bond. SSB is usually considered a rather low risk investment since it is backed by the government. For beginners who are looking at safer investments, SSB would be a good choice as well! Also, the starting amount needed to invest in SSB is also not very high, with the minimum being $500. Therefore if you do not have much capita to invest, SSB would be a good choice!Hope this helps and all the best in your investment journey!0 comments0"
3,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 20 Mar 2019This question has actually been in part answered by another thread, which had a pool of pretty good answers already! (https://seedly.sg/questions/what-are-some-good-investment-strategies)But maybe I can just add on with some guiding principles! Diversification: Aim to diversify over businesses, industries and even countries if possible. The main aim is to ensure that you spread your eggs over the different baskets, and your portfolio won't suffer too much if something happens to one of your investments. But do bear in mind that there can actually be risk of over-diversification! Pick one of the Investment Strategies and stick to it: Each strategy has got their own methods of choosing your stock, as well as their own pros and cons. They may also reap you returns at different time periods. Thus, to capture the full benefits of a potential strategy, do stick to the same one over time and not jump around too much. DYDD! (Do your Own Due Dilligence): Make sure you understand why you are making an investment, and do not go in blindly! Do not blindy follow the crowd, as people often get too excited or downtrodden when the market goes up or down.0 comments0"
