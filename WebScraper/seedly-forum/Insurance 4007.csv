1,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I do not advocate early ci. Just get the normal CI coverage.  Typically u can get 2-4x more coverage per dollar for the standard plain vanilla plan. eg, in the case of cancer, for the ""early CI plans"", u can claim when the diagnosed medical condition is still in the early stage (pre-cancer). A pre-cancer (stage 0) treatment is fairly simple, typically a surgical procedure to remove it. Such medical procedure is simple, you can go back to your normal life after a day. Afterwards with close followups and regular screening. The dreaded chemotherapy is not needed, it is only needed when cancer has spread, or potentially has spread.Not to say it doesnt affect your life. It is definitely traumatising. Cancer at the later stages will be life threatening and cause much physical damage. You would really want to stop working (or cant work) at that time. That is the time where a huge insurance payout will be life changing.Getting payout (money) at any stage is always good. Who doesnt? But is when the money has the greatest impact. From another perspective, the 2-3x more coverage is alot money. From $100k to $200-$300k. $200k becomes half a million. You can get $400k coverage till age65 for someone age 30 for about $1k premium annual. Go for direct insurance, dont buy through agents.Do add me on facebook if u require further advice. 8 comments0"
