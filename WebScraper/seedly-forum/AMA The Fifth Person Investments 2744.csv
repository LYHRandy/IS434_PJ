1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Feb 2019Hello! Dividend.com is a good one to track the performance as they offer a historical data dividend section! One feature I really like from Dividend.com is the advanced dividend screening. What this feature does is it allows you to search for companies that have increased their dividends every year for the past 10 or 25 years! Another good comprehensive stock screener is Google Finance. They offer a ton of financial and tehcnical criteria to search by for instance, price (52 week high/low), P/E ratios or market capitalization, dividend payouts, margins, financial ratios (book value, litquidity, leverage) etc. 0 comments1"

It is a portfolio tracker, and helps us keep track of ex-dates, payout dates, financial ratios, etc etc. Basically everything i ever wanted in a portfolio tracker is there. There is a free version, as well as a paid version. You can check it out here: https://stocks.cafe/help/support0 comments0"
