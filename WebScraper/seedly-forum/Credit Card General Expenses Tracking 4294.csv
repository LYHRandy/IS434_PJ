WizardAnswered on 28 Sep 20183/4 tank must be full before go into JB is the law requires or risk get caught will be fine at singapore side. ​Go Jb top up petrol, if you also go eat / buy groceries , watch movie etc. Otherwise the time , the jam may not worth the effort. Best if you go in for a few days then it is worth it just for petrol alone. ​The savings is more than 50% on petrol over the causeway. ​​​0 comments2"
