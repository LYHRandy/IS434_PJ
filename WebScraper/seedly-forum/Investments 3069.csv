Most of them have brokerage at $25.00 and minimum commission of 0.275%. The clearing fee etc should be the same for all.However, if you are using cash up-front account (deposit cash into account before buying the stock), then its better to go for DBS vickers (due to low brokerage 0.12% commission and minimum $10).You may also see the following article https://blog.seedly.sg/the-ultimate-cheatsheet-cheapest-stock-brokerage-in-singapore/0 comments0"
