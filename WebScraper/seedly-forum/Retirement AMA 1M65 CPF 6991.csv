1,"Loo Cheng Chuan, Founder at 1M65 MovementLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Nov 2018I do not pay much attention to the CPF LIFE scheme because I feel that it is grossly inadequate to fund my retirement lifestyle. Once you have obtained 1M65, you will discover that it will far outweigh whatever CPF LIFE is able to offer you. CPF LIFE exists because there are many out there who are unable to manage their retirement funding properly and CPF LIFE can function as a form of a safety net for this group of people.0 comments1"

We're living longer and CPF has to remain sustainable. We either need to expect lesser payout per month, a bigger increase in the Retirement Sum year on year, or a delayed payout.Most likely we'll see an announcement after the next GE.0 comments0"
