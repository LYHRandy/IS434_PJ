1,"Yeap Ming Feng, Head of Content & SEO at SeedlyLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I was from an MLM in the past actually. The one that broke the news, Sunshine Empire and here's what happened.​Before Sunshine Empire, I was asked to join a get-rich entrepreneurship programme called Alpha in JC by a friend. Back then, as a student, and this formally dressed wealthy looking man _(think MLM starter kit meme) _spends time talking to you, calling you team mate, it felt good.​Naturally, when promised financial independence at such a young age is like a dream come true. So I started selling Iraqi Dinar (their product) and my parents bought it to support me when they clearly know that it was a scam.​And naturally when the sales of Iraq Diner (they were still at war then?! How gullible am I?!) did not go well, the company paid for my membership into Sunshine Empire.​The pitch across was, "" we are sorry that the Iraq Campagin didn't do well, so we helped paid for all your membership with Sunshine to get rich!""​If you had been to Sunshine Empire's office in Toa Payoh back then, it's really beautiful! Within seconds, JC kids like us were sold! No questions asked. We were hungry for sales.​Over time, there will be leadership seminars, sales seminar, usually once a week. There was even a chalet where our bosses booked and gave us a really motivating session.​He spit onto a S$50 note, crushed it, and asked if anyone wants it. One dude raised his hand, and the boss went "" there you go! It's yours!"". In JC, S$50 bucks is a lot of money!​Over a span of months, I would bring my friends down to the office where my boss or mentor would pitch to my friends about Sunshine Empire's investment scheme.​It sounded easy, but if one does a bit of research online, the bag of worms is not that difficult to expose.Sunshine Empire claims that they invested in:Underwater hotel in DubaiA Sunshine Empire Building somewhere overseasHuge malls around the worldNone of the malls will ever appear in your Google searches.​And by putting in a 5 digit amount, one will receive constant interest overtime!​The Interest did happen! (At least for the first few months)​And then it stopped.​As more members join, the interest stopped coming, due to vast amount of members and there was simply not enough to go around. This is what we call the fall of the pyramid system.​My boss, Bryannz Fan, eventually went on to set up a few more MLM businesses and even became a Dato. Still rich, still sharing endless motivational videos and status on Facebook. LOL.​Of course, here's a list of MLM companies in Singapore: https://blog.seedly.sg/multi-level-marketing-mlm-companies-list/3 comments6"

5,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 12 Sep 2018Sharing from my own expeirence around 7 years ago as a fresh-out-of-army and hungry young dude.​I was considering between doing internships or learning sports etc. In the end when I was playing alot of tennis, I had a friend who shared how ""I COULD BE MY OWN BOSS"". ​So what happened was that one day, he brought me to this Mapletree business city location some posh office at the top few floors to interact with this guy called Bryannz Fan. (back then the internet was not so establihsed yet, so I did not have the luxury to do a google on the spot). But what happened thereafter was he showed me around his office and everyone was very cordial and they started talking about luxury high profit projects in neighbouring countries. And asked if I wanted in on it.​So we had lunch at some posh Sushi restaurant downstairs etc to start to gauge if I had enough family backing to put in huge sums of money to 'invest'. So coincidentally there was another meetup event where they invited around 100 plus folks down to this CBD area to talk about the projects they were investing in. What a strange sight I thought, I believe the minimum was around $5k-ish. And interestingly enough, there were people from all backgrounds, students, After-NS folks, old retirees and probably people with CPF money taken out. ​With all that being said, they showed 'real-life examples' on all the various investment returns % that they could make from the projects and stuff. I left because I knew for sure that there was no way in-hell that I would borrow money to invest or those dudes look mildly shady. Interesting one is that they actually gave us a $30 ROBINSONS voucher each. haha LOL.​So that was pretty much it, I never saw that friend till around 3 years later where I noticed he has left it entirely but never did ask about how he lost money. I read online that many did.​Another one example was a friend from school selling a health product and I had to pay like $3k right off the bat to buy the products to sell. Didn't make sense at all, so I walked away immediately. LOL0 comments2"
6,"Lim Chun Long Jimmy, Distributor at Newbrand Organic Green TeaLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019One day Mary (not her real name) contacted me to catch up over coffee (We have not been in touch for 5 years before that). During meetup, she wanna invite me to a seminar at a training hub about the money-making opportunity that she has been involved in for 2 years. ​I attended the seminar. During the seminar, 3 speakers take turns to present in front of the crowd to share how Amway has helped them achieve financial freedom. The 1st speaker claimed that she can now travel around the world almost daily, with pictures of her being overseas. The 2nd speaker claimed that she can now keep buying new clothes such that she wore each of them only once, with pictures of her clothes. The 3rd speaker show off his Rolex-es, a Lamborghini car key and videos of him alighting from a private jet and entering a big house.​At first I thought I have found my Lambo dream. But on 2nd thought, I chose not to join the money-making opportunity as I was not convinced.​Today Mary has already achieved Platimum level in the Line-of-Sponsorship.2 comments1"

13,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 12 Sep 2018Similar to MLM that we seen.I've been attracted to good free gift last time ( a video camera!) Where we've been pull to a talk @ orchard while shopping, so the sales person starts to bombard us with the timeshare of the properties in Gold Cost, saying we could pay by installment to buy the said vacation properties and the management will rent out for us and give us a cut after all cost related. ​Saleslady was permisistent for 2 hours and I've been persistenly saying NO that:1)  I don't buy major things without going home to sleep and think about it on 3 nights and2)  I don't buy things on the post no matter how good the deal is or how soon the deals / sale / offer gonna end soon​Next, as she fail to convince me to buy, she escalated the case to her Superior, ""The Manager"" and we continue another 2 hours of ""Tai Ji"" with my persistent No.​In the end after 4 hours of tiring battle, which we wasnt' aware it's gonna drag and take so long, we earned our ""Video camera"" ! hahaha! ​So, beware of those hard sell tactic and always persist!  You will emerge as the ultimate winner! :P​​0 comments0"

17,"Leong Wen FongLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Sep 2018I think I had just finished my Polytechnic, and my secondary school friend asked me out for lunch. Very innocently, I thought how nice of him to think of me! ​Nearing the end of lunch, he told me how much he was earning, and how great the company was, and how since it was expanding, they had a space and he was curious if I wanted to join. Then he invited me for  dinner a few days later, he said more of his company people will be there, and that he wanted me to meet with his boss, who was a really cool guy, etc.​During the dinner he wasn't even there, but another lady talked to a few of us, and talked about how everyone is earning a lot, some of them could even buy cars after 4 months of working, and boasted about how my friend was one of their top earners. Then she asked us to immediately message a friend to tell them more about the product and persuade them to join the company.​I was very turned off by then, and asked to leave the dinner. My friend never contacted me after that, ever again.​Well I guess this makes you sort of realize who your real friends are.0 comments0"
