question,"Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 18 Sep 2018What is shares of NTUC Healthcare Co-operative Limited and Shares of NTUC Income Co-operative Limited? What benefits does it provide?Hi all, my late dad had shares of the above mentioned. I'm really curious what this is about. We had the certificate of purchase (bought it in the 90's) and the price ($10/ share) stated on the certificate is the same as what NTUC will pay out to us today ($10/share). What benefit does it has? Dividend? He bought it twice. This requires nomination too, if not a probate is required. :(There is little information online, hopefully someone could enlighten me. Cheers and thanks!1 answerAnswerBump0"

MasterAnswered on 19 Sep 2018The straight forward answer for NTUC INCOME HEALTHCARE SHARES is to visit NTUC INCOME INSURANCE to find out the benefit and whether it has a dividend payment policy.From what I know and have from NTUC INCOME COOPERATIVE SHARES, the benefit does not come much from the 6% Dividend Yield because we are only allow to buy 20 shares at $1 per share so the annual dividend is only $1.20.The benefit of having the SHARES is the 4% patronate rebate capped at $6k per annum which is $240.As for selling off the share prices, you might have to contact them whether the membership cessation gets a refund for the exact value you bought in and whether there will be fee incurred for the processing.Hope my reply helps.If you feel this reply have Quality, please upvote and check other Quality Reply.https://seedly.sg/profile/kenichi-xiThank you.0 comments0"
