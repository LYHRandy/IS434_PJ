question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 26 Nov 2018I drag my feet to work every day. Should I consider a change of career even though I'm only 28?I studied accounting for my degree. My company is pretty okay, but I just really don't look forward to the work. Instead, I look forward to coding programs online (though I have no official background), and spend most of my weekend working on codes. Should I change my career?17 answersAnswerBump2"

I did accounting degree too and my passion is in digital marketing.
Didn't do the Big Four route cos I couldn't see myself pass 12months, let alone 36months to get my CA.At 24, I dreaded my corporate work and after working 14 months + pay back all my study loan. Quit my job to start a business.Learn lots from the first business but eventually parted ways and build my side hustle with focus. The OMO served me well but I was evaluating my choice when I saw my friends rising up their corporate ladder.At 29, I had to decide if I want to stay self-employed or go back and start from the bottom of the ladder and work my way up. So I took a #yolo trip to #findmysoul - i intended it 6 months but with an ongoing project I took 2 weeks. In that 2 weeks of travel, i realised what I had was a firstworld problem. I was doing ok and I want to jettison everything for something uncertaI also remembered why I dread a corporate job - I even filmed the dreadful CBD crowd marching towards their offices in the morning and watch it on my phone when i was talking a 5-day professional course to be reintroduced to corporate life. That drive kept me out of a corporate career.
So, my journey is somewhat similar, questions and questions before the big 30. If you have financial commitments/liabilities, make sure your decision is risk-calibrated/managed. Otherwise, experiment fast.One thing I've learned so far about career/work choices: 
Few know exactly what they are meant to do/their true north/ikigai.
For me, i learn to strike out quickly what I hate doing and keep trying new things. Once I find something/a community I like, I dig deep.
Kiss many frogs, one might become a prince. 
Date the prince. If it's a good fit, marry it with the rest of your life and make the most out of it. Carpe diem! 2 comments14"
2,"Xinyi Lum28 Nov 2018So encouraged by your answer, Kok Koon! Thanks for sharing~Heng Kai Le07 Jun 2019I agree that it takes time to find one's life purpose (or ikigai, as you said). I like the way how you lead your life, much like a design thinking initiative. discover need, prototype, try, strike out, prototype again, try again"
3,"Yuhan LianLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Given that you spend the weekend coding away, do ask yourself if you really enjoy it. For me, I fell in love with it.Here's some route you can consider:1) Hold on to your job, but during your free time say, after work or during weekend, build something and keep going through those free tutorials on YouTube and read those well-written documentation.These days, most technical team prefer someone who can do the job rather than some paper qualifications.2) Enroll into a course full time basis. I did mine in https://www.thoughtworks.com/jumpstart and never regretted spending 3 months working from morning till late, learning something new and to code in a big group. Though it is considered a tech bootcamp.3) If you need some allowance, consider internship. Some developers are kind enough to teach. You'll be surprised how much they are willingly to share. Rarely do I get this when I was in poly and uni.Regardless of which route you take, you should be ready to feel some discomfort and of course some financial strain if you do take the full time path. About me: I did step 1, 2, 3,  and now work in MNC as a developer after a year preparation :)2 comments5"

5,Steph YeoLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Is there a community of people w coding careers that you can consult on what a coding job entails? I'd imagine that coding as a weekend hobby would be q different as coding for a living. And i dont think age should limit you from switching careers as long as you make an informed decision. All the best!1 comment4
6,Charmaine Lim Xiaomei27 Nov 2018Linkedin will be the perfect platform to get advices! People there are generally quite friendly too
7,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Nov 2018it depends. do you see yourself being happy in another job? how probable would that be? if it is very probable, then yes, you should change your career.in the meantime, learn as much about coding as you can. Skills future offers some courses on coding i believe!0 comments3"
8,Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Nov 2018Perhaps you could take up a course in coding to see if you really like coding. You could consider combine your accounting background with coding to make yourself more marketable. Just my humble opinion.0 comments3
9,"Tiffany SQLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 26 Nov 2018Use your skill future credit ($500) or skillfuture study award($5,000) to study proper coding programs. You can check out many of the tertiary educations in Singapore, as many of them have specialised diploma courses, etc for u to take. From there u will gain networks and slowly switch to other fields once u know this is where u really want to be in :) And is okay.. many ppl do career switch in life too.0 comments3"

13,"Eva HJLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I do what I do best for a living (not my favourite thing  in the world and there‚Äôs a corporate ladder to climb)but in my free time (2-3hours per day + weekends) I build my own  side projects.Once one of the side projects can pay me as much as my full time job, I will quit. I do have a financial commitment so that‚Äôs the best alternative for me.1 comment1"

In my previous company not all programmers have computer science or IT degrees.
Some are from Business Admin and other branches of Science like Mathematics Physics or Biology4 comments1"

17,As DfLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 26 Nov 2018Look for bigger companies into digital transformation. It's kind of the in thing nowadays and being able to understand what the heck the problem is and how you can help automate will be a good place to go.0 comments1

19,"Heng Kai Le, Mondomover at School Of LifeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 07 Jun 2019I‚Äôm 39 this year, and I feel that career decisions are less irreversible than is normally assumed to be.I have always been a teacher after graduating from college. when I was 31, I took part in the Japan Exchange Programme as an Assistant Language Teacher. When I returned to Singapore at the ripe old age of 33, I wanted a change of scene and secured a job as a Japanese-Chinese-English PR executive.it was a gross mismatch. Like what you mentioned, I also dragged my feet to work every day. But I finally decided that quitting was nothing to be ashamed of and left the firm after my probation.so I returned to teaching. Am still a teacher. But I‚Äòm glad that I have that 3 months of PR experience under my beltyou never try, you will never know of course, taking on coding side projects will help you prepare for your big switch in time to come, so just gather as much experience as you can all the best!0 comments0"
20,"Jeff Yeo,   amateur Social contributor  at School of social sharingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Apr 2019I believe in this, you don‚Äôt have to love your job, at the very least you should not hate it. Dragging your feet means you most likely hate it and should look towards a career change. Since you found your pass in coding, I would say jump right into it.0 comments0"
21,"Npm AdeleLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 23 Apr 2019Yes. The answer is pretty obvious, isn't it? You know deep down in your heart this doesn't suit you and you do not wait it either. If you retire at 60, you still have more than half your life ahead of you. Further, you are still young in your career, can afford to job switch easier now. Coding's rising too. So don't be afraid. Just need to step out of your comfort zone!!:D0 comments0"
