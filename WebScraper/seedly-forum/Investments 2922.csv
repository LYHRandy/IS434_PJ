2,"Lim Chun Long Jimmy, Distributor at Newbrand Organic Green TeaLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 29 Dec 2018I attended their presentation a few times, for both Orion and Trident trading robots. The information I gathered during the presentation is consistent with what the other reviewer here named ""Jemi Sitanayah"" has answered.In short, if you're willing to take higher risks for higher returns, then Orion is probably a suitable trading robot for you. Else, go for Trident.Most importantly, do your own due diligence and decide your own course of action.0 comments2"
3,"Jemi SitanayahLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 29 Dec 2018Dear All,I would like to share my experience using Algo Merchant robot. I attended their presentation twice a few months ago. The first presentation I attended was about Orion and the second presentation was about Trident. During the presentations, they explained that Orion is a more aggressive robot and able to produce a high profit in the bullish market. Trident is a less aggressive robot compared to Orion and suitable in any market condition, either bullish or bearish. However, the profit is less than Orion.I was considering whether to sign up for Orion or Trident. After thinking for a few days, I decided to go for Trident. Five months have passed, Trident has grown 11% out of my 10K capital and it has covered one year of the subscription fee. Trident is not a holy grail as there are winnings and losses, however, the losses are quite minimum.So far I'm happy with Trident performance. I don't need to stay late waiting for the US market to open and close. I don't need to screen and do technical/fundamental analysis on thousand of stocks to decide which one to buy. I can still sleep well at night, perform well on my full time job and spend time with my family. The profit is a lot better than keeping the money in the bank term deposit.I would like to share my portfolio so we all can take a look together. Please remember to always do your own due diligent before signing up for the robot.0 comments2"

But there are monthly fees involved for using it. So far the charting functions are very good, better than chart nexus.â€‹You can try attending their events to find out more.1 comment2"

6,"Roy TanLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 24 Jul 2019For me using (their Trident robot) since July 2018, returns are roughly in line with the S&P 500 (~3% up since July 2018). However I put in only a small sum to test (since the returns in $ terms are small) and the 1080 fees I paid for 1 year subscription didn't pay for itself. Also, they choose very selective representation of a small sample period to show that they outperform the market by XX times, however as based on my experience there isn't enough evidence to show that they outperform the indexes. My suggestions for Algomerchant management: 1) have a free or heavily discounted trial period2) be more responsible in your representation3)work more on existing products instead of rolling out new robotsPersonally, I won't be renewing my subscription as I feel just purchasing an index fund is probably more cost-effective and until their robots have demonstrated consistent outperformance in a live trading environment for an extended period of time (at least 1-2 years) there is no difference to an index/mutual fund.3 comments0"

I just ran report from 23 July 2018 to 24 June 2019 and it was 3.83% on my account vs 7.12% on SPX (could have missed a a couple of signals due to technical difficulties experienced). Point is relative performance is pretty subjective depending on the period.  As of the backtesting point, I can partly agree but it is akin to the trader trying to sell his trading course by producing historical charts : ultimately its the dem...

We are sorry to hear that your portfolio did not outperform the market due to technical difficulties. However the HISTORICAL LIVE DATA shows Trident outperformed the market. We understand that different starting point will show you different performance, since it universally applies to any asset, except cash (always preserves same nominal value at different time). In order to avoid any accusation of ... (more)"

9,"Darryl Tan Shih ChiunLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Terrible. dont try it. Product still in beta. Team is weak in presenting and also actual support. They charge 100SGD a month for platform fees for their auto robot trading Orion. I tried it for 6 months and lost 17% of my initial 10k investment , excluding platform fees.They tried to sell me their other robot when I said the returns were terrible.Extremely poor and expensive experience. Please do not invest. 1 comment1"
