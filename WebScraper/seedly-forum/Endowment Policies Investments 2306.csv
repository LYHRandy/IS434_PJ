God of WisdomAnswered on 11 Mar 2019If you want potentially higher return but not guaranteed, invest. If you want decent returns, plus have guarantees, endowment. If you have more budget, do both.When you're young, you want to grow your capital as quickly as possible, when you're older you want to preserve it.So it's not either or, but how much and when.0 comments0"
