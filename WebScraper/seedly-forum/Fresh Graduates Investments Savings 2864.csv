3,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 17 Sep 2018hi As a fresh grad, you should building your defence first. Read this: https://blog.seedly.sg/beginner-series-tips-seedly-money-framework/Do Step 1,2 and 3 then only comes Emergency funds. Seedly share a lot on how to, you can work from there on how much emergency fund to build up. ​w/o a stronge defence,  emergency funds will be depleted anytime and retirement funds will be gone even before that! ​So do all the above in the links, build up defence, emergency funds, then can aim at investment towards your other goals (since you will get marry, settle down, have kids etc), so work step by step then about close to 30 when you have well prepared for all these middle goals, then can start focusing on retirement funds building. 0 comments2"
4,"Jay Liu, Diploma in Accountancy  at KHEALevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018Emergency fund is a pool of money ready to be used at any mishaps/emergency e.g. Hospital bills, money used after retrenchment. Build a emergency fund first. Then head towards building your retirement fund. 0 comments2"
5,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018Emergency fund can be 6-12 months of your expenses. So if you aim for 6 months your expenses is $1000 every month, your emergency fund should be $6000 which to be honest 1 year is more than enough to reach if you save most of your savings. Cant give you exact number cause i dont know your salary/expenses. After you reach your emergency fund, you can start to build your retirement fund. Then everytime your pay increase, increase your emergency fund again and then continue building retirement. If you are earning lots of money, you can also increase your emergency fund to 12 months of your expenses. It depends on your preferences.0 comments2"
6,"Jeff Yeo,   amateur Social contributor  at School of social sharingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018My advice would be to build emergency funds first in a high interest account like UOB One/DBS Multiplier etc​once you have 6 months of expenses then use the excess to go into investment. The profits can then go into a retirement fund or channel back into other investments.​may be be good to have clear separate accountS for this use case0 comments1"
7,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018In my opinion, an emergency fund should be built up first because you never know when you might need it. You can put this fund into somewhere liquid, where its easy to take out. A good sized emergency fund should be 6-12 months (like what Nicholas mentioned) of your monthly expenses.0 comments1"

9,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 18 Sep 2018First priority is emergency fund. Because it can protect you from any downside.​After that focus on retirement fund. 0 comments0"
10,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Sep 2018You can do both at the same time, but prioritise on building on your emergency fund first while investing slowly. Those monthly investment plans by Maybank KE come to mind. Or stashaway, where there is no minimum you can contribute to. ​Once emergency funds are in place, you can up your investment amount, or diversify into other investment schemes. ​Hope this helps0 comments0"
11,"Loh Tat Tian, Complex Manager at Ocean Ifm Pte LtdLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Sep 2018For this question, it seems like both options cannibalize each other (one or the other), but we can look it in another way.​1) Can you get your emergency funds up first? How long do you need to? This will already give you an idea of your retirement funds (which is normally 30X more than the emergency fund, since emergency funds are typically 1 year expenses).​2) If the rate to hit your emergency fund is long, then you need to employ the strategies as listed by HC Tang. From there, then you will be able to shorten the time period to hit the emergenc funds.​3) Getting an emergency fund also means, your first pot of gold comes right after saving the emergency funds. (anything in excess can and will become your pot of gold). Let your pot of gold turn into a hen that lays golden eggs (for you to sell off and build more pots of gold).​I opt to write shorter because many answers here have covered the rest of the details.0 comments0"
