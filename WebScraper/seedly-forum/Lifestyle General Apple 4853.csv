No need to bring out a whole chunk of cards (different bank cards have different promo and rebate). With Samsung Pay I can choose the best card for that particular transaction. Furthermore, Samsung pay have integrated with the SimplyGo for bus/MRT usage. Rewards and cashback. As mentioned by yewfong, use cards that gives cashbacks or rewards such as miles to get the most out of your spending! On top of the card rewards, Samsung Pay has its own rewards too!0 comments1"

The more intermediaries there are, the more benefits there are to consumers because they have to entice you to use their platforms. i.e. Credit card cashbacks are also applicable on mobile payment platforms and on top of that, as everyone else mentioned, some mobile payments platforms do offer rewards (Dash, Grabpay etc, Samsung Pay etc.)0 comments0"
