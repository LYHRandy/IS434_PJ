question,"Bank Account Credit Card Asked by AnonymousAsked on 02 Dec 2018Hello, I am heading to China in late December. I need to buy a bus ticket from an agent who only accepts RMB via WeChat/Alipay and USD via PayPal.Does anyone know how i can send them the money? I have done some research and both options require a chinese bank account. Is there no other way? Many thanks for your help in advance!1 answerAnswerBump0"
