1,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusUpdated on 03 Sep 2019Hey there. The bank will send you statements, though I guess there have been one or two cases I think the mail was lost (read: possibly dumped in the trash by the mailman).Easy solution - sign up for e-statements on the SRS.
This was just available for OCBC since July 2019 I think. Before that, I guess its only pure paper statements.1 comment1"
