WonderkidUpdated on 10 Apr 2019It depends on how much you spend in a year.Two round-trip Business Class tickets to Europe on Saver will cost you 92,000 miles (one-way) _2 (round-trip) _2 (two pax) = 368,000 miles.The optimal strategy is to achieve 4 miles / dollar (not taking sign-up bonuses or promotions into consideration).That will take about 368,000/4 = $92,000.How much do you spend in a year?If you spend $36,800 a year, it'll take about 2.5 years.Most optimal card set up: https://milelion.com/credit-cards/guide/0 comments0"
