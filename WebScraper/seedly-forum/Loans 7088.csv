question,Loans Asked by AnonymousAsked on 12 Sep 2019May I know how could I prevent my maid from lending from licensed money lenders? Thank you!?I'm currently having a problem whereby my maid keeps borrowing loans from licensed money lenders. I am aware that there is a framework set up by the government recently on how to tackle this issue. There have been debt collectors who came up to my house to try to collect payments from my maid and this had caused some stress among my family members and myself. Would be really good if someone could suggest me how to deal with this! I've advised her time and again on the best money practices.1 answerAnswerBump0
