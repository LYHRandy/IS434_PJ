Growth companies at the extreme like uber, lyft are growing rapidly but losing money.Secondly, if the mature companies are not paying out dividends or buying back shares, sooner or later they will be debt free and cash rich
They are then at risk of being taking over by corporate raiders and thus they will overpay for silly companies to get rid of excess cash.0 comments0"
