1,"Sg 30s DudeLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 25 Aug 2019Had some experiences at both public and private hospitals due to my family's medical condition, here's what I think about the pros and cons.Time with Doctor/Private vs Public care-Private practice doctors tend to spend more time explaining the patient's condition (usually more detailed) and are more readily contactable. -Private Nurses also tend to be more experienced both in terms of medical knowledge and degree of care (hospitality)-In comparison, public hospitals tend to be crowded (understaffed nurses) and senior doctors are usually not readily reachable apart from their daily morning rounds. Its common for medical students, junior doctors as well as nurses repeating the same questions to patients with nothing being done in between apart from waiting for procedures or decision from senior doctors (e.g. Do you feel pain? on a scale of 1-10 how much pain? ..... it can be rather annoying when you are in pain. )Waiting Time-Typically no/low waiting time in private hospitals compared to public hospitals. Worse for non-life-threatening conditionsGeneral environment-Private hospitals tend to have fewer beds per room (probably max 2), sometimes it can get rather rowdy in a public wardLastly, on the additional $777 premium for private hospitalisation coverage, believe in the event you opt to ward in a public hospital despite having private hospitalisation insurance, you do get some cash rebates from the insurer. Hope the above helps.0 comments3"

WizardAnswered on 25 Aug 2019Coming from the perspective of someone who just visited Parkway East today for a fractured foot (bringing literal meaning to #breakaleg), this one-off experience has not been superb for me AND I was finding myself wondering if I would have had a better experience at a polyclinic.Because of Sunday charges, it was an additional $120 for each X-ray, just because it's a SundayIt was still a fairly long wait. In fact, every time when things started moving was when we asked them how much longer we had to wait. Only then, they would attend to us. For that, I prefer polyclinics because at least there is more visibility on waiting times
That said, I recall having to bring my mum to CGH and Parkway East on two separate occasions. The latter was a much more pleasant experience for her; whereas, in CGH, we were staring at a cockroach loitering down the hallway.
On a more serious note, I feel that better doctors ARE IMPORTANT in the more complex illnesses. Eg. neurologists, oncologists etc. And from what I see, I find that the better ones tend to be in private practice.
Happy to hear more perspectives!0 comments2"
3,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 22 Aug 2019I doubt any plans give you full coverage currently. Because of the co-payment scheme currently required now for Private.  https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/5-per-cent-co-payment-new-integrated-shield-riders-10021398
I can go through with you the pros and cons of each. Private - Do not need to wait to send to any hospital, no pro-ration. Might have daily hospital benefit should you choose to send to Public Hospital instead. Wait times 90% shorter than public (because they are THAT expensive, no one really goes to them).Public - Full suite of services for all kinds of medical complications. However, waiting time is bad especially if your condition is not as urgent as the rest of the patients. Cheaper premiums.I believe some insurers have SAVER options or similar, which allow you to pay only the deductibles (fully payable by Medisave), which gives you the option at least, to go public or private (with no pro-ration to the co-insurance).0 comments0"
