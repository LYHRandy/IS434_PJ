ProdigyUpdated on 09 Jun 2019Assuredly yes. doing something to improve your situation beats feeling stuck in a rut. true, taking the coding course could be time-and-energy-consuming, but on the other hand, it may also energise you as you acquire not only coding skills but also the technical jargon that will help you in your work. also, you may also meet people who are in a similar situation as you. or you could meet someone who can serve as a mentor. building connections outside work is priceless. the thing is, you never know until you try, so just go for it. at the very least, you will gain in self-confidencemy friends from non-IT backgrounds say that coding is not a passing fad, is here to stay. so i think picking up some Python skills will help you in your career. if not now, then in time to come.gambare!2 comments4"

WizardUpdated on 09 Jun 2019First of all, what is the exact reason why you are struggling?If it is purely technical and you know you can turn it around with improved coding skills, then definitely yes! At the same time, learn from your seniors in the IT firm if they are willing to help you.2 comments3"
4,"Question Poster09 Jun 2019Thanks for your reply. Yes, i am struggling at work as i am still not very proficient in my coding fundamentals. Therefore, i am contemplating whether i should sign up for a coding bootcamp to upgrade on my skillset which would improve my working efficiency.

However, i would also like to put emphasis on my new job and not to neglect my work. Signing up for a bootcamp means extra commitment out of work...Junus Eu09 Jun 2019I would go for it! And, also tap on your seniors at work to see how you can do better. You have a good mindset with putting in extra commitment, and I am sure your peers at work would be able to see and sense that :)"

GeniusUpdated on 10 Jun 2019Hi anon!I hope you do find your work interesting even though you are struggling (so you don't dread going to work on Mondays haha).There a few reputable coding course providers in Singapore:Hackwagon AcademyUpcode AcademyNTUC Learning HubI personally attended Hackwagon Academy's Data Science 101 and found it a good introduction to Python! They also offer courses on Full Stack. They offer weekly classes on weekday nights or weekends which will fit your work schedule! I recommend you continue to take higher level courses such as Data Science 102 & 103 as 101 is a really introductory course. There are various subsidies offered by the government under the Data Science track (you can click in to find out more). Hurry apply before the subsidies are terminated!!Hope this helps!1 comment1"

Yes, i have heard of hackwagon. From what i know, they will only open the next Full Stack Development part-time course on late 3rd quarter. And that is one of the course that i am considering.

I am also looking out for other training providers which provide on software develop... (more)"
