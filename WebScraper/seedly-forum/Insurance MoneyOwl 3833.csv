The main downside is you have to go down to their office during office hours to meet the advisor for the final process.The advisor explained everything very well, going into the details of the policy. There was definitely no hard selling or pressure, just a simple sit down and explaination.You can ask any questions during the meeting. After sales, not too bad for me so far. I haven't had the need to make claims so I cannot attest to that.But the advisor does send me whatsapp on updates to moneyowl, like the launch of moneyowl investment, and about the upcoming events by moneyowl.0 comments5"
