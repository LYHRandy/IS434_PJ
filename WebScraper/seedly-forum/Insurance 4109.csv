2,"Daniel LeeLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 03 Jul 2018to answer your question, let me ask you this question instead: ""what are your priorities and what are you hoping to achieve by having this insurance?""  While i may not understand your current situation, I can provide you with some suggestions as to how you can decide if the coverage itself is sufficient. ​First, you must understand the purpose of a life insurance: a life insurance is essentially an instrument that helps provide you with the money you need to REPLACE YOUR INCOME should you encounter an unfortunate event that causes you to be in a situation where you cannot work (be it illnesses, death or disability). ​For a start, for individuals of your age, the conservative amount that you should be looking at in terms of coverage would be 15-20x of your expenses (expenses that you need to maintain the lifestyle you're enjoying today) or income depending on your preference and comfort level. ​Just like technology, the insurance market have also been constantly evolving. Over the years, there is a new invention called ""multiplier or booster"" which multiplies your whole-life sum assured coverage for a certain period of time (usally till the age of 70). ​Because of this invention, consumers are now even more confused at finding the right level of coverage for their life insurance, because while they understand that they might need 300k in coverage, there lies a question of how much the base coverage should be and what is the corresponding multiplier. For example, to achieve 300k coverage i can get a different mix between the base sum assured and multiplier: 100k x 3 or 60k x 5 or 75k x 4. ​As such it is the basis behind your financial plan that matters at the end of the day when it comes to answering all these questions as you will also need to strike a balance between cost payable and benefits receivable to ensure that you're not spending too much in insurance expenses. That is why I posed the question of what are your priorities.​Bottom line: To answer the question of how much is enough is not as simple as what the market seems to say - 10 or 15x income or expenses, there are alot of other factors that you will need to consider and balance it out before a proper decision can be made. As such, i would suggest you focus more on the PLANNING aspect of things to help answer your question. ​Usually, what i would do for individuals of your profile would be to consolidate their financial portfolio and compare what they have today with their own expectations and the products that are available in the market. Only then can we come to a sound conclusion of whether:​1) the coverage is enough2) what you're paying is worth what you're receving 3) with your current financial portfolio, will you have any troubles in financing for short-term commitments and achevie your long term goals? if not what are the alternatives? ​Best of luck! :) ​​​0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 03 Jul 2018If possible, go though with a trusted FA for the plans.​The 40k coverage may or may not include CI, ECI, which is important.​For general advise, the only person who is happy if you cancel is the company insuring you.​Why not seek to top-up instead (my 50k coverage limited pay is $1400 a year).0 comments1"
