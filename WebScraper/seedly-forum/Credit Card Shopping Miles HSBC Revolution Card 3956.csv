Grand MasterAnswered 4w agoYou may have to download the specific credit card transaction terms and conditions to see if Singtel Dash is EXCLUDED.My guess is almost or all credit card out there would have excluded Singtel Dash, and set it under topping up of another payment system, and hence no credit card points for such transfer of money anyway.0 comments0"
