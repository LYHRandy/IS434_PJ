Grand MasterUpdated on 04 Jun 2019Deposit Insurance Scheme (SDIC) will cover your money in bank up to $75000.Even without this, given MAS tight policies on the banks that are allowed to operate in Singapore, i say there is very little risk of savings that will be lost.Rest well.Do note that despite the assurance, you are losing value of money kept in the bank because of INFLATIONDo the right thing- go for stocks or ETF funds. Or bonds if you have less than 5 years to use those funds. Do not do the riskier thing and leave your retirement savings in the bank.0 comments1"
