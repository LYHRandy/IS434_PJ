3,"Nguyen Thu HaLevel 1. FreshieUpdated on 29 May 2019Hi Yvonne!This depends on how long you are planning to hold the unit. Currently, Tengah is considered an “ulu” area with limited accessibility. Jurong Regional Line with a dedicated Tengah MRT station is only targeted for completion and opening in 2026. The town is planned to be car-free, meaning that the use of private vehicles will also be restricted.The Jurong Innovation District’s completion in 2022 may create spillover demand for Tengah. However, with the planned 42,000 new homes, it might take a while for the demand to be absorbed fully and for the price for your unit to go up.If you are eager to upgrade in under 10 years, we wouldn’t count on it to appreciate so much.
