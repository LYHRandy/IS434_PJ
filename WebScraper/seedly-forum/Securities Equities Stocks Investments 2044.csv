1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 24 Mar 2019There are mainly two school of thoughts:1) Time in market: Basically what this means is that it's always best to invest and stay invested for the long term (what Nicholas is sharing)A simple strategy to adopt here would be to do a Dollar Cost Averaging Strategy DCA. Which invests a fixed amount on a regular schedule regardless of the current share price. This way, you average out your entry price in the long run and stay invested.I personally do this for index funds (ETFs) such as a the STI ETF.2) Timing the market: Find the lowest price (or roughly where you think it's low)There are a 2 signals you can consider for Dividend Paying stocks:At the Highest historical Yield % = Dividend payout / Share priceBasically for this, it is true when the dividend payout is consistent but the share price drops to a low, thus it will be where the historical yield % is the highest :)The gap between the historical Share price to the Book price (NAV) is the widest, This is abit obvious but also makes the most sense.Now this is obvious because: The NAV (net asset value) is bascially the price if you liquidate the company and all it's assets, the actual value of the company per share. Thus naturally, if there is a gap, it means that the price is 'under-valued'.I learnt some of these at the Dividends Machine class with the Fifth Person, you may be keen to go for it, I learnt a ton over the whole day spent at the course: You can check out the reviews for the course here: https://seedly.sg/reviews/investment-courses/the-fifth-person0 comments2"

MasterAnswered on 24 Mar 2019Hi there!That's a good question that I'm sure everyone has in mind and here's a brief illustration to show how you can better ""time"" your entry when buying stocks.(Do note that in the graph below, I'm looking at the share price movement of SGX: BS6 Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Holdings Ltd)If you notice, the share price seems to follow a general upward trend (I'm using the 50 Day Simple Moving Average (SMA) Trend Line in this graph, which looks at a more short term movement of the share price, do note that you can use the 100, 150 or 200 days Simple Moving Average if you want to have a better idea of how the share price move over a longer time horizon). What a SMA does is that it functions as a support in an uptrend or a resistance in a downtrend. I will not go so much into detail but generally, the price of the stock/whatever you are looking at would generally follow this trend. Hence, if you are bullish that the price of a stock will go up in the short-medium term (after doing your own research and due diligence), you might want to wait until the stock price retraces to somewhere above the 50 Day SMA before making an entry in order to maximise your gains. Disclaimer though, this does not work 100% of the time it is merely to serve as a rough guide to how you can optimise your investments/trade.Hope that helps!​​​0 comments1"
