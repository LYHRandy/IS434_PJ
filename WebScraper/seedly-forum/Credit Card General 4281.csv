question,"Credit Card General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 19 Oct 2018How many credit cards do you have, and how do you maximise all of them?Credit cards were always portrayed as a bad thing to have by my parents, and something that is unnecessary. Yet I've also heard that there are benefits to them. How does that work?2 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Oct 2018Currently an NSF and I have 1 debit card which is the CIMB AWSM Card which has no annual fees (Free) and gives 1% cashback on Dining and Entertainment, Telco (Starhub/M1/Singtel/Circles) and Online Shopping (Qoo10, Shopee etc.). If I spend on those categories which qualify for the 1% cashback, I'll pay using my CIMB AWSM Credit Card. Otherwise, I'll pay using my DBS Visa Debit Card. Credit cards are bad when you can't control your spending or pay your bills on time since you'll either overspend or land yourself in a credit card debt due to the late payment fees and interest  0 comments0"
