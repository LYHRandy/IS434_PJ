1,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Apr 2019Hello!1) InflationI personally feel that the main reason for investment would be due to inflation. Over time, the value of our money depreciates, due to inflation. Thus, with investment it would be able to increase or maintain the value of our money instead of depreciating it.  Investing would help to grow your money.2) Saving for reitrement Investing your money would also help you to grow your savings that would be able to help you save for retirement3) Reaching your financial goals Investing can help you reachyour financial goals. If your money is earning a higher rate of return than a savings account, you will be earning more money both over the long term and within a faster period.Â 0 comments1"
2,"Jansen NgLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 02 Apr 2019Firstly, it is important to know that if we do nothing, inflation still hits us at around 2.2-2.6% and our value of money depreciates over time.Savings generally wont hit this high, perhaps some higher savings acct at 2-2.2%, or ssb at 2.16%. Hence one way u can see investment is to just retain ur value of money, and invest in lower returns instruments such as bonds etc. Most people see investing as a means go grow their wealth. So instead of working longer or harder for the money, u make your money work harder for you.0 comments1"
3,"Billy Ko, President - Investment Club at Singapore Institute Of TechnologyLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Apr 2019Hi there!Both Zann and Jensen brought up really good pointers on inflation, savings and growing your wealth. Let me add on a couple of others to hopefully get you to see the light on investinga. Diversifying income streamsMany simply rely on one major income stream to fund our expenses etc. However, sometimes we don't see the 'what if's' because in this case, if one loses their job, that sole income stream will be gone too. Therefore, investing will allow one to have passive income which in turn reduces one's financial burden should one income stream be suddenly taken away. b. No one got rich working a 9 - 5 jobWell, truth be told, we all want to get rich (probably gonna be shot by many as rich differs for all) but we all do want to get the things we need and (if possible) want as well. This adds as an additional booster to supplment our funding into the necessities in life. c. Let your money work for youEveryone has 24 hours in a day and we can only generate a certain amount of money working on a task / role. However, the amount of money your money can generate for you is endless and best of all, it can do it 24/7 even while you're asleep.I hope you see the light in investing. It's never too late and never too early to start investing. Now is always the right time. I invested since I was 18 and have been averaging 7-8% annual returns through REITs and Blue Chip stocks, not the highest, but it's something as opposed to my peers who doesn't.0 comments0"
