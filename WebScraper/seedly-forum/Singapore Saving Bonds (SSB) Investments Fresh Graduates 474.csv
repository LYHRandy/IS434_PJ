On a minimum investment of $500, that's 0.4% already.Recent SSBs have also been providing pretty sad coupon rates. Unless you're doing this to build an SSB ladder (6 consecutive months of purchase) to satisfy the DBS Multiplier Investment Category, it may not be the best investment decision, especially for a recent graduate who can be looking to take more risk and build an aggressive portfolio.But if you still want to go ahead, then buying $2000 will make the fee just 0.1% of your purchase. I think that'll be a reasonable fee for such a product.0 comments3"
