Most banks require a salary to do so. Some may allow you to apply for a credit card provided that you can put a collateral with them, but the quantum of the collateral is usually 5 figures.Perhaps Aaron of Milelion or even Aik Kai of this community could chime in with his knowledge here.0 comments2"
