1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Mar 2019Some predict Uber's stock to perform better due to its larger market cap, approximately $120 billion at offer compared to $15 billion for Lyft. However, you can get a bang for your buck by investing in Lyft. The lower the number of shares being traded, the potential for market manipulation is greater. Investing in Lyft is more risky than investing in Uber due to the nature of Lyft's assets. Despite Lyft investing billions in building their network and brand, there's little tangible assets to show it. Apart from some intellectual property, there isn't much liquid assets to pay off obligations.0 comments1"
