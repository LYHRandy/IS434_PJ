question,"Credit Card DBS Altitude Visa Signature Card Asked by AnonymousAsked on 01 Aug 2019Are online transactions part of 'eligible local spend' for the DBS Altitude card?Are online transactions e.g. Shopee, Facebook ads, Google ads, Spotify, GrabPay, FavePay considered as eligible local spend for the DBS Altitude Card? I called a staff earlier today and she said these aren’t counted. Does that mean that the card can only be used for local retail store purchases? I'm looking for a general spending card for miles here, so this card doesn't seem very ideal if it’s just offline local spend. Anyone using this card who can shed some light? Thanks!1 answerAnswerBump1"
