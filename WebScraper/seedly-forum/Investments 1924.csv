If you're a student and your school has Bloomberg terminals, you're able to obtain the certificate FOC. However, do note that the accreditation is only valid for a year so you have to constantly re-accreditate yourself if you're keen. I wouldn't say its like the star on the Christmas tree of your resume, but it can certainly act as an ornament on the Christmas tree. Increases your knowledge on financial concepts too!0 comments2"

MasterAnswered on 30 Mar 2019Yeap I've done that!Its a course that will take approximately 10 hours to complete and I found it to be extremely beneficial as not only did it help me revise finance concepts, it also helped me gain mastery on some of the key functions on Bloomberg that will come in handy if you are looking for a career in the finance industry/complete school assignments that require financial data which may be otherwise difficult to obtain.0 comments1"
