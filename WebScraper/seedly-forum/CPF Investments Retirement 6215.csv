question,"CPF Investments Retirement Asked by Farik OmarAsked on 19 Mar 2019What should I do to save on income tax?Hi, I’m in one of the Uniformed Services and will be retiring in 5 years time as part of compulsory service tenure and I’ll be 55yrs old by then. My SA should meet the FRS even if it raises to $200k by time I retire. I have a loan for my EC which I need to service till I’m 60years old using OA.

2,"Goh Kah Kiat, Editor-in-chief at Risknreturns.comLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 21 Mar 2019Hi Farik,As your SA is likely to be capped at this year's FRS, I don't think there is much leeway for you to top up your SA. If there is, you can only top up to $7,000 for tax relief. If you are married and your wife has not reached FRS, you can consider topping up your wife's SA up to $7,000 for tax relief.Alternatively, you can top up your SRS account up to $15,300 as you indicated.I've written an in-depth 4 part guide on how I plan my taxes.

5,"Kenneth Lou20 Mar 2019Hi Farik, I just went to help you find :) The limit on the total amount you can put into your SA is up to your FRS. However, the max per year for CPF relief each year is up to $7,000 per calendar year if you are topping up for yourself and additional tax relief of up to $7,000 per calendar year if you are topping up for your parents, parents-in-law, grandparents, grandparents-in-law, spouse and siblings.
