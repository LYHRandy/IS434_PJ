1,"Brandan ChenLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 02 Aug 2018If you are looking for a summary, it shouldn't be more than a page and should cover the following areas. Death, accidental Death, TPD, CI, Early CI.In addition include the premiums you are paying for be it monthly or annually. Cash vs CPFWould be good to have a remarks column to capture key information like the scope of  coverage and till when the coverage ceases.Drop me an email at Brandan.chen@manulife.com.sg and I can share my version with you0 comments2"
2,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 21 May 2018Usually I would ask my FA to add in whatever I feel is missing. After all they are the FA and should do their best to help you understand your financial situation. Otherwise, the alternative is to find another independent FA to do a financial report for you and then you can do a comparison.​Perhaps you can share some details as to what you think is missing from your FA report. Because there are alot of financial stuff that can be included but not all are suited to everyone. 0 comments1"

I believe he/she should be well-versed enough to include all the categories to ensure that you are sufficiently covered if he/she prescribes to a hollistic insurance planning for his/her clients.​If you need a second opinion, feel free to drop me an email (gabrielgrantt@aia.com.sg)​0 comments0"
