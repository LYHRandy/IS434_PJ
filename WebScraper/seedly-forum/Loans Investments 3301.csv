1,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 02 Oct 2018Heard of them through Facebook, they are regulated by MAS and have funded many loans. Based on their statistics, they have 0% default rate.

Don't invest too much at one go for a start or into a single loan. https://sg.seedin.tech/statistics0 comments0"
