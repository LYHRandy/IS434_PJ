3,"Charmaine NgLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Jun 2018As Gabriel has mentioned, if your school has a installment plan then please go with the school. Otherwise, I'd suggest you take out a study loan (I highly recommend RHB - they had better interest rates vs the other banks) Link here but please do your own homework as there are always promotions etc.​Never use your credit card for school fees if possible. First, for installment plans it's up to the bank's discretion to approve or not. Meaning banks could reject and they don't need to provide you a reason why it is rejected - it is just rejected. Then you'll be slapped with the hefty interests. Two, your credit limit will be limited during these period of time until you clear the sum and if you can't, your credit score will be severely affected as well. Double whammy.0 comments1"

WizardAnswered on 02 Jun 2018If your school allows for an installment plan, then you can consider it.​But please check before going for installment plans.Check for extra fees/charges.Total up the monthly payment, check that the total installments = the full bill. Sometimes you pay more for installments.​Do note your credit limit is also going to be reduced if you use an installment plan. 0 comments0"
