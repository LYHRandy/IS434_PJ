1,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 07 Jun 2019Unfortunately, no, there isn't. Any laws can be changed with a simple majority of elected MP. Even the constitution  can be changed with a supermajority vote. There are only certain areas with a 'backup' plan. That is using Singapore's past reserves and appointment of key civil service appointment holders. This power lies in our elected President. But this is only possible for a term, and hopefully the next term a 'proper' governemnt will be voted in place. The elected presidency is actually mooted by our late Lee Kuan Yew. Quoting Mr Lee said in an interview (regarding if a 'rogue government' was voted in)  "" if you change all the permanent secretaries, military chiefs, commissioner of police, heads of statutory boards, then you’ll ruin the system. For five years, the President can prevent that. And our past reserves cannot be raided. ""​​​0 comments0"
