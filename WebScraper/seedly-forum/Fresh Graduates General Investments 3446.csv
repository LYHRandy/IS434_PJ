1,"Chris ChinLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 04 Sep 2018In a financial crisis, almost every stock is affected.
However, you need to hold on to your stocks if you invested in good companies with good business fundamentals.
Many novice investors sell off when stock prices drop in a panic response, while institutional investors would buy more at low prices or sell off to invest in other good stocks in their watchlist that has suddenly become dirt cheap if they have made enough profits before the price drop below his profits. 
During a financial crisis, It's your holding and buying power that helps you come out better and richer if you made the right investments.0 comments3"

GeniusAnswered on 04 Sep 2018There are people who view a market crash as opportunities. ​Here are some stocks which you might want to take a look at: https://blog.seedly.sg/stocks-to-buy-in-the-next-market-crash/​I think fundamentally it is important to know what are some of the stocks and industry that generally do well in times of market downturn. In the mentioned article, companies such as  Alibaba Group Holding Limited, Alphabet Inc. (Google) and ETF such as SPDR S&P 500 or PowerShares QQQ ETF were mentioned. Might be worth looking at. :)0 comments1"
3,"Lim Chun Long Jimmy, Distributor at Newbrand Organic Green TeaLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019 Diversification is key to surviving the next financial crisis and thereafter. You can still hold mixture of stocks, bonds, REITs and cash. Let Stashaway do most of the diversification and rebalancing for you. If you have at least 5-digit cash to invest in addition to cash set aside for diversification, can consider currency-neutral investments such as property and fine art. 3 comments1"

5,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 04 Sep 2018Theoretically with a roboadvisor you most likely will not lose all your money. You will likely see your portfolio in the red with a paper loss but unlikely it will be portfolio value = 0. Because if it goes to that case where your portfolio assets go to 0, it is more than a financial crises, more like a great depression. Then we will all be in deep trouble.​What to do during financial crisis?​Stay calm, stick to your plan. You can even pump in more money to ETF or stashaway and HOLD on to your portfolio. Ride out the downturn and you will see the up.​Do not panic sell0 comments1"

7,"Khuan Yew CheahLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 04 Sep 2018No, you will not lose all your money especially if you are diversified through a roboadvisor, government bonds and ETF. The ride downwards may be unpleasant but if you understand that over the long term, economies and markets trend upwards with occasional bouts of negative returns, then you'll be better able to handle the downturns. Fearing the next crisis and not investing with the appropriate risks could have significant impact on your retirement. 0 comments0"
