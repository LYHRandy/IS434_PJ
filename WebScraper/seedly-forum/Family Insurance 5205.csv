God of WisdomAnswered on 20 Aug 2019Hello, reading your question carefully, you mentioned that you wish to use the plan to ""cover all costs associated with maternity""...I need to point out that maternity insurance is not meant to cover the costs of childbirth, gynae check-ups and the likes. Maternity insurance is meant to cover costs associated with pregnancy complications, congenital illnesses etc.However, if you are in the market for a maternity plan for protection purposes, then there are a multitude of plans available. Some are stand-alone plans, some are bundled plans, some offer the transfer of Critical Illness coverage without any medical underwriting to the newborn, etc. No two plans are similar, and I would suggest sitting down with an independent advisor like myself who can list down, explain and give you a wide range of options. The final decision on which plan to take up is ultimately yours to make, but having the full range of information at your fingertips will make it easier.0 comments4"

RookieAnswered on 19 Aug 2019AIA Mum2Baby Protect is a bundle of the Wholelife plan AIA Guaranteed Protect Plus II (GPP) together with maternity coverage.1) The AIA Mum2Baby plan allows you to transfer the life coverage from you to the baby. Includes also the early critical illness coverage.2) You can guarantee life insurance coverage for your child after birth. 3) This is very important as I’ve seen children born with conditions like heart murmur that complicate any insurance coverage at birth.For IVF/IUI/ICI and ICS pregnancies, there is no extra premium needed and this can save you quite a bit.Once again, there’s no such thing as the best plan as there’s only the more suitable ones!

ProdigyUpdated on 20 Aug 2019Hi Jean Michoud,An international healthcare plan with the maternity benefit can cover your costs with maternity after you've cleared the waiting period (typically 1 year).For pregnancy-related risk, it can be covered with a pregnancy plan. Manulife Readymummy is the latest offer. I have arranged it for my private clients on many occasions. To get a general overview, this post can help you, all the best and congrats! https://www.theastuteparent.com/2018/11/should-i-buy-pregnancy-insurance/0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 18 Aug 2019The most recent, award-winning one is Manulife's ReadyMummy.It has the most features, is technically standalone (meaning you have no obligation to buy another policy at the same time) but you also preserve your child's future insurability AND you can buy the follow-up policies at a discount if you do opt to buy them (e.g. Life Plan).You'll notice I didn't actually answer the question because best is subjective.
But worth a consideration!
