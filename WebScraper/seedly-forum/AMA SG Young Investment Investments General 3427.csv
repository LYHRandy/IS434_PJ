1,"Soh Sing Heng, Financial Blogger at SG Young InvestmentLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 11 Sep 2018I'm not afraid of a market crash as I'm still looking to invest more. I still have quite a lot of cash to deploy so a market crash will be good for me personally. For us retail investors, it will be always good to have a war chest (standby cash) so we can deploy during a market crash. 0 comments0"
