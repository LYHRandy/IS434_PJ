1,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 19 Nov 2018I do not quite understand? Did u mean u have $700k cash, and want to buy 2 properties with the money? If u do not want to take a loan, u will have to pay full in cash. Unless u have a property already paid up, then u can take a mortgage on that property, and use the money to pay for a new one. Then rental of the new property will be used to pay the mortgage. 0 comments0"
