1,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 11 Feb 2019It's not  about fees, its about the long run.IF you're truly invested in the long run, it's certainly worth the risk. Asset allocation is 90% of the returns and it provides very decent asset allocation. So you have an alarmingly high risk-adjusted return, certainly higher than the STI ETF or even the SNP500 ETF (although the sharpe ratio is roughly the same and the SNP500 returns are higher). But I mean if you're invested in the long run anyway, you should go for higher returns. Which you can get, if you're willing to take more risk. I can help you with that.0 comments0"

Its just that robo advisors can rebalance for you and help you take care of your investment. DIY will be better as fees will be lower but it will take abit more effort. Some people dont like to think too much so putting money with robo advisor is easier for them. 0 comments0"
