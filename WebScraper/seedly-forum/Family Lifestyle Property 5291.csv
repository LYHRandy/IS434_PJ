WonderkidAnswered on 02 Mar 2019Hi!Generally, mature estate resale HDB flats are more expensive, that's why those who manage to get a BTO in these areas enjoy high capital appreciation.Which mature estate in particular - Tampines/Toa Payoh/Ang Mo Kio? This is an important question to ask as there are new towns that are springing up and BTOs are coming fast, i.e. Bidadari, Whampoa and you should consider trying out at these areas if you have not done so.If you plan to stay in the resale flat until the end then the only worry you should look at are your finances:If you are able to afford the downpayment + stamp dutiesIf you would be able to offset the mortgage loan with your CPF and incomeSee if the resale flat is close enough for a Proximity Housing GrantThe reason this is so is because resale HDB flats trends generally depreciate a lot, especially after 20 years. If you are not planning to move out until the end, then this does not matter at all.However, for those who are not certain on where their final homes would be, buying a resale flat can be a huge mistake as they have already bought it at a high price and are forced to sell it lower because of the depreciation.It is unlikely that condo prices will be lower than HDB resale prices in the same area. Although depreciation is less for condos in the long term and there is a potential for en bloc, the upfront payments and mortgage may take a bigger toll on your wallet. There's a lot of questions to ask here - family size, TDSR, future plans but if I may provide you with general advice based on your question, its this:Keep trying for BTO, especially in New Towns (that are close to where your parents live)orKeep track of resale prices, if you don't plan to move out and plan to retire in that flat and get one close enough to qualify for a proximity housing grant.If you need any clarification on the above information, feel free to contact me. Will be more than happy to help you out.0 comments1"
