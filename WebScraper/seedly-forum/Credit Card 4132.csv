question,Credit Card Asked by Prasanta SahaAsked on 18 May 2019I'm new to Singapore. How long should I wait before applying for a credit card? I've seen few banks are asking for 3 months salary slip. Do I really need to wait for 3 months applying for my first credit card?2 answersAnswerBump0

1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 18 May 2019I believe that a minimum income of $30,000 per year is required to apply for a basic credit card in Singapore, and that could be higher if you are a foreigner. I do think you would need to wait 3 months first, because chances are that the credit card application would get rejected and you would need to re-apply again when you have 3 months of salary to show.0 comments2"

If you dont have salary slip with you, they will ask to open up your cpf and do a back calculation, because they need a verifiable source. Gotta wait >3 months. Because on their end they gotta make sure your salary is consistent and stable. If you are working for commissions, then will require longer period like 6mth-1year or dependingIf you are a foreigner, may require higher than 30k a year depending on credit card terms0 comments1"
