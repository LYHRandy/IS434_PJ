question,"Bank Account General Asked by Guillaume RondanAsked on 07 Jul 2018Incorporating a company in Singapore for a non resident?Hello,I am a French living in Vietnam owning an online business and I will close my current company in France as i don't live there anymore (I am living in Saigon, Vietnam and I plan to stay in SEA for the next years).Singapore would be a good place to set up a company (I might do business in Vietnam in the next years as well) and having a company in SG would allow me to diversify my assets and rely on a strong banking system. if someone have contact of reliable company doing the incorporation, I am looking for some feedback. is it easily possible to open a personal bank account in SG when we own a company in SG (but not resident ?).Thanks ;)Guillaume1 answerAnswerBump1"
