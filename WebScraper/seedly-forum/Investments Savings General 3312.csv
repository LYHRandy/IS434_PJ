It's literally my job to be an expert on the entire subject. ​Meh well..​Bank Account: DBS Multiplier and UOB One is suitable for getting your salary, higher interest and convenience. Your emergency fund, which you can get used to keeping with your low pay as a painful habit, will help you maintain the criteria. Estimated additional interest is almost 30 times a standard savings account.​Passive income/dividends​Passive Dividends: Typically people turn to dividend yielding stocks, bond/bond fund coupons and REITs. For diversification, you probably want a combination of all three. Most fund houses will provide funds that provide this for you easily, but you can manually do it yourself if you are the type that enjoys picking out things individually. Do keep track of your spread costs. You should typically aim anywhere from 5 - 10% a year in dividends, assuming that's what you want.​Should you even though?: There are very few scenarios where your small capital and even small dividends are going to amount to anything particularly significant. You may want to consider options where you grow or reinvest that money instead.​If you are largely into dividends, like Kevin O Leary, just ensure that profits aren't taken out of the NAV. There are a variety of funds that do this specifically or take measures to do this, by taking advantage of currency differences for example. ​My overall portfolio did 32.7% on every dollar I invested last year, so if you change your mind on the Financial Advisor thing, you can always drop me a message.​https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.54​​​​2 comments3"

As a recent grad, it's better u focus on your job full time. Do dollar cost averaging with your savings in some equity funds, it will do you well in the long run. 0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 29 Sep 2018If you really want the best for a dividend portfolio, you need to look to the US market, specifically at two classes of stocks known as dividend aristocrats and dividend kings. These are the companies that raise their dividends every single year for at least 25 years and 50 years respectively. No mean feat. The starting yield may be lower than what you may get out of a REIT here in Singapore, and there's 30% withholding tax to boot. But over time as you hold the stock the dividend will increase and make up for these.​For access to US market, consider using a broker like TD Ameritrade where they have an office in Singapore, or IB Brokers (minimum USD10k to start). Their commissions are cheaper compared to other local brokers here, I believe. Use a bank account like DBS' multi currency account to change to USD at your preferred rates, and then remit the funds over to the broker online. There is a promotion now for zero fee remittance to the US, so if you open a TD account, this will help save on some wire fees.​Hope this helps0 comments0"
