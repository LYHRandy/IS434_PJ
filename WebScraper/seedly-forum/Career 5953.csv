1,"Huang YixuanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi! Since you said that you have no prior experience, I think the first step would definitely to find out if this is something you really have the passion for. For UI practice, you can start with copying, go to pinterest and look for UI designs that you like, and start replicating them. You can understand UX principles better by reading up, there's lots of resources online. I use Sketch for designing digital products, and Adobe Illustrator for illustrations.To prepare yourself for a career in UIUX, you definitely need a solid portfolio. This might mean that you would have to take on internships to gain the exposure, if you get a good mentor, I'm sure you'd learn a lot. UIUX is something that can only be learnt with real life practice, a course might be helpful to get you started but try to look for more hands on opportunities! If you have other questions you can reach out to me on Facebook :)All the best!1 comment2"

WonderkidUpdated on 15 Oct 2018I second the GA UX course that Tee Ming suggested as I have friends doing it who recommend it, but if you’re not so inclined to drop $4k so quickly before commiting to UI/UX, try the free courses on Coursera/Udemy.Then, try to create some cool website/mobile prototypes that'll utilise those skills, so that when you're looking for jobs, you can present that website and explain how you applied UX principles to it.Since you're not great at coding, I reckon you should learn Photoshop if you don't already know, as it's a skill you'll more than likely need in UI/UX.Anyhow, the GA course is great because you get to makeover existing company websites, and if they decide to implement it you’ll start off your UX career with a bang haha.0 comments1"
4,"Tee-Ming Chew, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019There are courses that you can attend to learn more about UI/UX. For example, General Assemnly does have a User Experience Design Immersive course which focus heavily on UX portion.From what I see, many employeers do tend to look at your design portfolio. So do try to build your own (especially the focus area you're interested in)!Hope that helps!2 comments0"
