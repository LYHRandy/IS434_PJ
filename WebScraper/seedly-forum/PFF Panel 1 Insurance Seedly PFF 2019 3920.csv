So from the above choices you mentioned, Aviva MyLifeIncome would be the one I'll look at.You'll get projected 4% return, 2+% guaranteed, and a lifetime income without a drawdown of your capital.So if you're old and not interested in the annuity payout anymore, you can surrender the plan and get more than your premiums paid.0 comments1"
