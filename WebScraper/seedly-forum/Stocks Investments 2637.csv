1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 26 Feb 2019A Goldman Sach analyst actually warned that this could be an issue for Apple. Apparently, the fold technology that Samsung uses is still not accessible to Apple, and that it has a 2 year lead time over Apple. Depending on how consumers react to the product, there could be an impact on both companies though.

2,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 26 Feb 2019Big as it was, investors must evaluate how attractive consumer demand for a foldable phone will actually be. For me, seeing this news gives me a little throwback to my younger days during Nokia's glory days where Motorola Classic flip phone was a thing. Whether its the start of a new trend or anything more than nostalgia____- time will tell. Personally, looking at the preliminary footage(found in link below), I think we might be on the cusp of future smartphone design. But at its price point of 1890 USD, it might be beyond the reach of many consumers.Also to note: Samsung is not the only company who announced this. Huawei's MateX has also just been announced hours ago(marked at 2600USD). Lets stay tuned to see who wins this tech innovation battle.https://www.cnet.com/news/galaxy-fold-vs-huawei-mate-x-battle-of-the-foldable-phones-comparison/0 comments2"
