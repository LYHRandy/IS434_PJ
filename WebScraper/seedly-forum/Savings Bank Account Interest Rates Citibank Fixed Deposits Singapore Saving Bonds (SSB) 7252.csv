question,"Savings Bank Account Interest Rates Citibank Fixed Deposits Singapore Saving Bonds (SSB) Asked by Ha Lai WahAsked 2w agoShould I stick with Citibank Maxigain or get higher interest elsewhere?I have a Citibank Maxigain account with about 16k inside until the new rule came out needing 70k and above to enjoy the max interest rate. Right now I am on step counter 12, meaning I am getting 1.2% interest.So I am thinking should I continue this account or I should go for others like SSB or FD to get higher interest?Many thanks!1 answerAnswerBump0"

I would recommend using Citibank Maxigain if you can manage to top up to 70K, as it is no-frills but do keep a few months spare cash at other accounts. If not, I will keep the 16K at Citibank Maxigain as it takes a year to gain 12 counters, and put the rest of cash to either Maybank iSavvy/SCB Esaver/CIMB Fixed deposit depends on how much cash and do you need it for short terms.
