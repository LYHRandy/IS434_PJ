GeniusAnswered on 21 Aug 2018Hi, ​  the most profitable investments tend to be the investments that are most entrepreneurial. what do i mean by this?​  These are the investments that you need to combine time and effort, as well as to execute well:​i seen someone have a forex trade that worked well that turned $20,000 to $300,000I seen a lady turned blogging into a very lucrative side businessI have seen investors identifying small caps, put in adequate amount of money and seen a small position balloon to a 6 figure positionI have seen people quit their current work domain and pivot into doing property which is a much more lucrative career​you would realize that the common trait is that they can be lucky, but also take a lot of risk. There will be many that fall on the wayside, and we only get to tell the winner's story.​For all the above i have seen  more people blowing their $20,000 forex accounts, give up on blogging, and lose money in small cap investing, not to mention burning a lot of money in property sales and not closing.​i view my money this way:​​you try to minimize your spending. what you are left with is your wealth. I dont have savings or investing. It is just my cash flow or my wealth. And I try my best to grow it. I grow it so as to meet some goals that I have. ​I dont aim to save a certain %. ​rather, I try to become real clear about what i spend on. if there is not a need to then i minimize what i am left with i try to set them aside.​I have a section called building your wealth foundation. It is free and it contains all the stuff that makes the most impact to your wealth. might be helpful for you to read it0 comments2"
