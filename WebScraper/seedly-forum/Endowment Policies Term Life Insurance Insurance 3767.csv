5,"Bryant ChuaLevel 1. FreshieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi Cherie,most term life insurance are paid yearly for the term that you choose. It still provides for a life coverage for the stated number of years that you are looking for. Limited pay would be more for the Whole Life insurance, paying for a 10/12 years and getting coverage for life. However, limited pay are usually more expensive as the cost of insurance are squeezed into those few years instead of spreading it out.Hope this helps! Do drop me a PM if you have more queries 1 comment0"
