1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 May 2019No. Not really a good idea to hold BTC. Would rather you learn how to trade BTC like a commodity instead. Or subscribe to signals that allows you to do so. Know of a group that does so and they seem to be doing quite well0 comments0"
2,"Billy Ko, President - Investment Club at Singapore Institute Of TechnologyLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 11 May 2019Personally I don't feel that Bitcoin would be considered a wise investment choice over stocks and the following are my reasons:1) No valuation methodWhat's the NAV of Bitcoin? What's the PE or PB ratio of Bitcoin? Is bitcoin considered cheap or expensive now? No one knows. Now, many would say this goes the same for commodities as well. However...2) TangibilityGold, you know its something physical, something that's present. Although when you purchase gold from the stock market, it isn't physical gold but however, it is a lot safer than Bitcoin.3) No trendWe know that gold prices moves inversely to the market (similar to bond, investors to retreat to this 'safe haven' when markets are going chaotic), however, that isn't the case for Bitcoin which has no correlation to markets and is simply operating in it's own vacuum. It operates more manipulatively i.e. when some large investor buys into it = confidence booster = price shoots upAnd lastly, even if you manage to hold it for long, pray hard that no one hacks into your bitcoin wallet - as we've been hearing quite a couple of such news https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/05/09/binance-hack-marks-6th-largest-in-crypto-history-lost-bitcoin-recouped-in-47-days/I would advise you to go for stocks anytime for the opposite reasons of all I mentioned above0 comments0"
