1,"Andrew Fong, Associate Partner at St. James's Place Wealth ManagementLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 19 Nov 2018Yes. You now have the luxury of working because you enjoy what you're doing instead of working to pay the bills. If working is not an option, finding an activity to occupy for time is essential.0 comments2"
2,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 01 Apr 2019For sure. After all, work can provide meaning in life. I would definitely still work, but on my own terms. Take for example, the need to take the MRT at peak hours. As a daily user of public transport, I find that taking the train at peak hour and looking at many bored faces looking at their handphones quite depressing. Additionally from a bigger picture level, we still need to find and live out our lives purpose. That usually comes from work, not idling.0 comments1"

4,"Yeo Wee TeckLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 20 Nov 2018Work does not just contribute money. It is also a source of meaning for some people. In 2-factor job satisfaction literature. External factors like pay and benefits are considered as ""hygiene factors"". One will not be dissatisfied if the amount of it is sufficient. On the other hand, there are the so-called motivators like job meaning. With sufficient job meaning, one would most likely continue to stay at work. Meaning could derive from many different factors. e.g. nature of work (e.g. doctors), able to contribute their wisdom despite older age (e.g. professors). For me, I would try to stay in work force as long as I could if I believe I could continue to contribute my expertise.0 comments1"

For me, if money is sufficient, perhaps i would work part time to past time, keep myself relevant to the society and have my brain working. In that way, i could have more time to do things i really wanna do. :)0 comments0"
