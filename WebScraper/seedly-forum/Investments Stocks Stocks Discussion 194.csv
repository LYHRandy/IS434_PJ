1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 08 May 2019Business ProfileEstablished in 1828, Boustead Singapore Limited (SGX: F9D) is a progressive global Infrastructure-Related Engineering Services, Geo-Spatial Technology and Healthcare Group listed on the SGX Mainboard.They have 3 main divisions.

They have also had several first-mover advantages which have enabled Boustead to maintain their foothold in their industry. They also have quite a healthy balance sheet but perhaps too much cash on hand.Weakness: The firm has had decreasing revenue over the past few years, which is a sign that demand for the firm's services is decreasing. The energy sector for the firm isn't doing well due to the cyclical nature of the sector as well, which brought down overall earnings.Source: Boustead FY2018 AROpportunities: There is also definitely a need for the services they provide in a growing Asian economy with a growing middle class. Their strategic operations could allow Boustead to really ride on this growth and improve earnings even further.Threats: Trade tensions between the US and China, and perhaps now within Europe and the US could impact their earnings more significantly. The increasing protectionist stance of countries might be a long term threat especially.Source: Boustead FY2018 ARFinancialsSource: Boustead FY2018 ARIncome StatementSource: Boustead FY2018 ARAs a whole, revenue as a group has decreased consistently over the past few years, which is quite an unhealthy sign, that has been accompanied by a fall in net profit. As can be seen, the bulk of revenue comes from Real Estate Solutions at 49%. However, I believe their revenue streams is well-diversified such that Energy and Geo-Spatial both contribute substantial amounts as well.Source: Boustead FY2018 ARThe most profitable segment is Real Estate Solutions, contributing the most amount of profits, followed by Geo-Spatial technology. In fact, energy had made a net loss in that year. This segment was affected by the global O&G recession which continued for the fourth consecutive year. Real Estate Solutions was impacted by the challenging industrial real estate sector while Geo-Spatial experienced steady demand acrossexclusive markets in Australia and South East Asia.Balance SheetThe company has a very strong balance sheet, as evidenced by the high amount of short-term liquidity and very low debt levels. They also have very low liabilities, which reduces default risk. However, I do believe that the company is holding too much cash. This is evidenced by a cash ratio of 1.27 times! I believe that the more cash should be reinvested into the business, either through R&D, capital expenditures or acquisitions, since the balance sheet seems very healthy as well.CashflowsFor FY18, the company looks like they have quite strong cash flows. They have a decent amount of cash flow from operating activities and had a positive cash flow for investing activities due to disposal or the sale of financial assets. For financing activities, it is quite heartening to see that the company has been using cash to repay debt and pay out dividends. However, they also bought back shares from shareholders, which may be another sign that the company is hoarding too much cash. Cashflow seems quite strong, with a good amount of Free Cashflow especially when compared to sales.0 comments1"
