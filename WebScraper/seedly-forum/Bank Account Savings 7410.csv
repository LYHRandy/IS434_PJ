question,Bank Account Savings Asked by AnonymousAsked on 26 May 2019I need to pay my kids school fees twice a year. So I usually put aside an amount every month. Is there any account that is preferred for this type of movement other than my regular savings account? My intention is that i get some kind of minimal interest and I also don't use that money till I need to pay the fees. Which is every 6 months.1 answerAnswerBump0

If you have already maxed out those type of account, you can try CIMB Fast saver, recently they have increased the interest rates to 1.5% for above $50k.6 Months is a really short time for most Fixed deposits. Though you can try Singapore savings bonds but take note there is a 1 month withdrawal time required so it might be even more inconvenient to move the funds around.0 comments0"
