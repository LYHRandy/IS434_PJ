question,"Credit Card Asked by AnonymousAsked on 07 Apr 2019 I was thinking of getting a credit card that can give me good rebates.  I am considering the Citibank SMRT card, but not sure if all my onlline spending will be recognised as such? Are there better cards out there for me?I buy from taobao, iherb, lazada, zalora, travel websites (airlines, airbnb, booking.com) most frequently and I was thinking of getting a credit card that can give me good rebates. My other in-person spending would mostly be F&B, fairprice and ezlink top-ups. Monthly spend ranges but usually under $600.3 answersAnswerBump0"
