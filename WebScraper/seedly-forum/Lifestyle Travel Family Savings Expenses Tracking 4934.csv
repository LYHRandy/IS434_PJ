Still water can be more expensive than sparkling water, so bring along bottles to refill at the hotel or if you chance upon any water coolers.Depends on where in EU you are going, you can check out Eurail passes. Youths get discounts off these passes.Don't visit theme parks unless you absolutely have to, and buy gifts from Aldi or those budget supermarkets, foodstuffs you can't get back home cheap or at all. Like ferrero hanuta, it is so cheap there.0 comments2"

You can combine it with Shopback to earn cashback and pay with a credit card to earn rebates/miles/rewards depending on your credit card. Check online to see if there are free walking tours available. It's always great to explore the city with locals as you'll be able to better experience the local culture and they know some hidden yet good spots like for food.

It is hard to plan a trip but more than that it is very hard for one to limit the budget according to the plan and i make sure that i exceute my whole plan as planned.Starting from ticket bookings to the overall plan i make sure that i never miss a single thing that let me spend more money and on abaove all one must have to book the tickets and stay properly as that is the amount that asks for more amount and that is where we must have to save the best amount.There are many travel sites that are aailable online that definitely give you a great travel experience and a beautiful stay that too within the budget. The travel sites like Oman sir, Etihad Airways, Emirates, Qatar Airways like this we have many travel portals that offers exclusiive offers on bookings. Before booking you must have to check the offers that every travel site is offering and choose the best disount available offers in the travel and then book accordingly so that you can save the best amount. It may find difficult for you to check each and every site and find the offers that is why the coupons website Rezeem list out all the offers at one place so that you can easily choose the offer that you need among all.So, go through the offers that stores got for you and use Oman Air coupons or any other offers while booking to get the discounts.0 comments0"
