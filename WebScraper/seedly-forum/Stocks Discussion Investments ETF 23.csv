God of WisdomAnswered 2w agoYou are right.The ABF SG BOND ETF tracks government/sovereign corporate bonds largely from the government of Singapore, as well as stat boards such as LTA, HDB. Hence, the average credit rating is AAAThe Nikko AM SGD Investment Grade Corporate Bond track corporate bonds from a mix of government/sovereign but this time with a mixture of private sector companies thrown in the mix, including our local banks, etc. Hence the average credit rating is A. It's perceived to be not as strong, credit-wise, compared to ABF SG Bond ETF, but it is still investment grade.3 comments2"

A35 has been around longer, but the AAA rating of the underlying will mean you cannot expect very high returns. For MBH, the A credit rating will probably allow a higher upside. Both are investment grade so that should provide you some amount of ease when it comes to risk. MBH is likely to return better returns over the long run compared to A35Question Poster2w agoOkay thank you so much for the informative advice!"
