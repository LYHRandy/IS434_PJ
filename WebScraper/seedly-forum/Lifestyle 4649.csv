every car inside has an ""annual depreciation""
from that u can estimate the depreciation for that model.
For example, this Vezel depreciates around $9140... other vezel would be around this figure tooWong YH13 Sep 2019Thank You!  Sorry, i missed that portion but u kindly reposted the thread. Much appreciated..."
