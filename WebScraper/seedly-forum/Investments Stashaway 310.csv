question,"Investments Stashaway Asked by AnonymousAsked 6d agoAny recommendations on how I should build my portfolio, with around 1k/month to invest?Hi, I'm 25, I have set aside an emergency fund of 6 months expenses and managed to save around 100k for my warchest. The 1k/month is purely for investing as I have another sum set aside for future big-ticket items, such as house and wedding.I would say I’m aggressive, currently on $200 monthly to StashAway (high risk, 36%)2 answersAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomAnswered 5d agoHi anon,To put things in perspective, you will want to compare your current portfolio size with your warchest.If you have not started anything or have a small or negligible portfolio size, then consider taking maybe 20-25% of your warchest to start off investing. If your portfolio is already sizeable, just stick with $1000/mth and retain your warchest in FD or high-interest saving accounts.Although your profile is aggressive, it is still prudent to ensure that you have hedged yourself against market risk. Consider putting together a multi-asset portfolio with various asset classes in order to make sure your portfolio achieves some semblance of balance. Your budget of $1K/mth can be used to build this portfolio while the warchest sits and waits for opportunities. If you need help understanding the classes of assets available to you, speak with an independent financial advisor to understand your options.Lastly, if you have 6 months of expenses in an emergency fund, consider bumping it up to 12. In the current economic climate, finding another job can take as long as a year.1 comment5"

4,"Question Poster5d agoGot it! Any recommendation on which books/courses I can consider?HMHeah Min An4d agoI invest in stocks, which is an ownership of businesses plus I’m passive thus I like value investing.

I started off with Robert Kiyosaki’s 2nd book: A Guide to Stock Investing; it was 10 years ago thus I may have gotten the book title wrongly."
