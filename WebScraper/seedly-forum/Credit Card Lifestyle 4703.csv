I've owned a miles card for close to 10 years. Based on personal experience, it is incredibly difficult to accumulate sufficient miles to redeem for air tickets if you do not spend lavish amounts monthly. I had to spend close to 70k miles to redeem an economy ticket to London. The main reason I managed to accumulate large amount of miles was due to payment of school fees for family members as well as unfortunate incidents such as hospitalisations that raked up 5 figure sums.
You can also do some additional research by looking at the miles calculator, https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/ppsclub-krisflyer/miles/mileage-calculator/
Search for a desired travel location, look at the miles needed, divide the amount you spend monthly and you'll have a good guage of how long it will take to accumulate that amount. One more thing to take note of, airlines can adjust the minimum miles needed, as and when they desire. This can make it even harder for you to save up the minimum required miles.Examples:Citibank Miles CardLets take the London example. If a ticket costs 70,000 miles, you would have to spend approximately $58,000. Assuming you spend $1,000 a month, this will take you close to 5 years.
Citi Cashback Credit CardAlternatively, if you use a cashback card that gives you 8% on Dining/Groceries/Petrol,""8% cash back on Dining, Groceries & Petrol daily, worldwide. Subject to cash back cap of S$25 per category per statement month with a min. spend of S$888 per statement month.""Assuming you receive $50 cashback a month, this gives you $600 a year. You would have received $2,400 in cashback in 4 years, enough to purchase an economy ticket to London.
Happy researching!0 comments0"
