question,"Investments General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 06 Mar 2019For the young and still studying individuals, instead of investing in the stock market, would you recommend that they do sales on the sideline to earn higher returns?Because purchasing items and selling it can be seen as an ‘investment’ too right! I wouldn’t consider it a business yet just sales. Products may be like phone accessories, clothes, k-pop related goods, gaming gadgets etc (selling may be on carousell or having a website/pop up store)4 answersAnswerBump0"

And, also not so much to earn money from the get go, but starting to work at a young age really instils two values:It takes hard work. I know of peers who come from wealthy families, and for them, having money is a given. But the realization when you need to start earning your own keep is very rewarding.The value of thrift. When you start to earn your own money instead of getting it from other sources, you will then really examine where you are spending your money.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 13 Mar 2019Yup! after all, unless you are planning to purely work on your investments full time, you should also look towards earning a steady income on the side to pay for your own expenditures and perhaps look to pay for your own school fees, hall fees etc.I think financial freedom is easy to say, but not easy to do. Alot must be sacrificed in order to achieve the level of payout from your investments that easily allow you to retire comfortably with just a passive investment strategy. Personally, I'm working 2 part time internships to pay for my own expenditures, while learning as much as I can from my jobs at the same time. I think if you are passionate in learning and constantly improving, you will be able to do it!Not only that, the opportunity to expand your network via these selling of items can come back to help you sometime in the near future, you never know, the person you meet next may be your business partner in the future!0 comments0"

Just need to remember also that one is still studying and technically investing in oneself, so need to be committed to that and not be distracted if/when the money comes in.0 comments0"
4,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019You dont have to be young and still studying to do a side gig. There are other people who do side gigs such as sales, tuition and so on to increase their income. If you want to have more income and you have the ability to do side gig, just go for it.2 comments0"
5,"Question Poster06 Mar 2019I agree! Just wondering bc the community seems to encourage investing at a young age (time in the market) but we lack the capital (say >$10k) to invest in equities so would this side gig be more viable in earning returns above 6%? (I’m thinking aside from Blue Chip plans and Robo Advisors).Nicholes Wong06 Mar 2019I think you can also do both. Although to study, side gigs and invest at the same time will be extremely tough. It is important to find a good balance. If you are good in investing, even $1000 can earn good sum of money. It really depends on the individual i guess."
