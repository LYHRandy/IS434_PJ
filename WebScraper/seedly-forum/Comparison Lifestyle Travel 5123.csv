1,Dawn FionaLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 21 Oct 2018Klook. I've tested them out and compared prices locally multiple times - they usually come up tops in terms of convenience and are either equal or even lower priced than what the locals will charge the tourists in the countries I've tested it out in.Combine with a cashback or miles credit card that rewards for online travel bookings for even more savings ;)0 comments1
2,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I recommend looking for and booking tours through Klook - https://www.klook.com/city/63-krabi/ . You can also use Shopback when checking out to earn 3.50% cashback (for tours) and pay with a credit card (if applicable) to earn rebates/miles etc. depending on your credit card's reward scheme. Also, check online platforms like Picodi and Cuponation to see if there are any promo codes that you can use to get more discount!My friends and I used Klook to book a one day tour when we were in Taichung, Taiwan during our graduation trip in March this year. Good experience and affordable price! 2 comments1"
