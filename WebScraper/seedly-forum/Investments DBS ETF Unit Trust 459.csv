1,"Jessica Ann LeeLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 05 Sep 2019Signed up a while ago.Always been interested in Robo-advisor, the concept of putting money and not caring about it (maybe check once a year or once every quarter). DBS is a local bank and I have accounts there, so the signing up process is really easy.It's pretty new, so no one can tell you the performance results now, probably need to wait 1, 3 or 5 years later.Sign up now with a small monthly contribution?2 comments1"
2,"MTMax Trimble05 Sep 2019Yeah, I've been reading up on it but there doesnt seem to be too many reviews online. Not sure how the cost/fees compare to other Robo-advisors like Stashaway. 

Will think about it some more. How much do you put in monthly though?Wai Kheng3d agoIâ€™ve invested in StashAway. Think their fees is 0.86. Returns depends on yr selected portfolio. There's also syfe which I have not tried yet. These platforms fits investors looking for ease and long term. If you have the know how, saving the mgmt fees is a better option. I've just tried DBS and the returns came pretty fast."
