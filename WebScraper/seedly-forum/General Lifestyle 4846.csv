question,"General Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked on 03 May 2019Should I learn driving when I'm in NS?If I have to repay my student loans (approx $50k), and require at least $7,500 (source:https://blog.seedly.sg/buy-car-how-much-should-be-earning/), Is it actually worth learning driving as a NSF considering that it will take quite some time before I can reach a stage where I can purchase a car?6 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Jansen Ng, Business Student at NtuLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Yeaa best time to learn, regardless if u can only afford a car in later stage / you may not even want a car. To me, learning driving is a good skill to have, and I dont intend to get a car till i have kids (IF i have kids:p)But, consider the following (caveat, based on my own thoughts. Others may disagree): Are you able to practice after you pass your driving license (eg family car) . Im asking this because passing the test is just the first step, but if u dont start driving after u pass, it is easy to forget / become not confident. But if u can drive outside (eg family car or rent) for >5-10 times after u pass ur license within thr first 6 months or so, the skill you learn when driving will be more ingrained and probably this is when ppl say that if you learn driving you wont forget it in your lifetime. But if u learn finish but dont touch a car in the first 1 year or so, good luck to you cos its easy to become not confident and require more time to rebuilt the confidence. Will you need to take on more debt. If so, I rather you dont learn, because driving will take $1-2k, and your student loan seems quite heavy.2 comments4"
2,"JJoel04 May 2019Agreed. You gotta factor in the cost of car ownership in Singapore. Owning a car is just for convenience and in this day and age, travelling around via MRT/Bus is way easier than beforeJansen Ng05 May 2019Yep thats right. But imo, personally im of the view that even if i wont be owning a car in singapore, it makes sense for me to learn driving because (1) its a good skill and last a lifetime, (2) if need be i can rent a car for short period of time, (3) can drive overseas easily.

In fact, i also learnt 2B motorcycle license for the same reason lol. And I dont own a bike in sg. Haha some may think its a waste of money, to me its more of a lifeskill an... (more)"

4,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 May 2019I do think that it is the best time to learn. If you were to wait till you finish repaying your student loans, which might be 4-7 years later (assuming you're going to university), then you will likely not have much time nor the energy to learn.0 comments2"
5,"JJoelLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 03 May 2019If you intend to drive in the future , learn during NS. Else dont bother learning if you donâ€™t intend to drive. Taking private transport like Grab is still cheaper in the long run.0 comments2"
6,"Justin Kieran OngLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 03 May 2019As someone that just started working with no license, NS is definitely the best time to learn. Even if you're in a combat unit, there will be more time closer to the end (if you need to do stand by/4NTM, ETC) for you to do it.Most commanders are OK with you going to learn as long as there is no distruption to training and you come back after.0 comments2"
7,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 03 May 2019Yes...it is one of my regret not doing it during NS.Once you come out working life or continue uni studies, really is no time to go learn driving.0 comments2"
