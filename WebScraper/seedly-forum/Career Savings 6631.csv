1,"Png Cheng Xi Damien, Happy Life Seeker at HomeLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 09 Jul 2019You already know the answer. It takes so long for you to save up the sum, you have to put down everything after ~8 years (including any bonuses, career progression, life plans) just to do a Master's degree overseas for a few years; and come back to start anew.How much will the masters give you in terms of employability and value?1 comment0"
