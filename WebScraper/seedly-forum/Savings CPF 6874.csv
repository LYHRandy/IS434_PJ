Your interest is deposited into your CPF accounts and thus distributed according to your nominations done. The only scenario that this is semi true, is in the event that you have paid the premium for CPF Life. Interest earned on your premium is paid to the lifelong fund and not paid to you upon your demise but instead paid to you when you outlive your CPF Life premiums paid.0 comments0"
