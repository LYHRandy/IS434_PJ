It’s a retirement scheme haha.ponzi schemes require you to keep contributing and recruiting downlines to get more sales people with no real product.our cpf funds are invested through temasek and GIC. And here’s the thing. The money you see on your cpf login is REAL.my dad passed away earlier this year. My mum recieved a 6 digit cheque from cpf basically his CPF savings. And she now doesnt know where to put this money which has similar safe and high returns at around 2.5 to 5 percent.food for thought! But good question.1 comment3"
2,Question Poster19 Nov 2018but where do they get the money to add on the extra 2.5-5% though? do they do investments? Is there a chance this money will be lost?
3,"Luke HoLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Well it's not like Social Security...that's very much the exact structure he was talking about and pretty much a Ponzi Scheme...it's understandable where he's coming from, though - but it doesn't make it true. There's a world of difference between it being invested safely and the measures in place to make sure its not a Ponzi scheme compared to the actual thing. 2 comments2"
4,"Question Poster19 Nov 2018how do they make sure that they can constantly give back the 4% (from SA)?Luke Ho20 Nov 2018They kind of don't, really. 

I run/ran a SME investment management business so I can tell you roughly how it works, since I tried to emulate the CPF model. 

Basically Temasek makes about 15% annualized through the fact that they're a large institution, so they get access to all the cool Accredited Investor stuff, cheaper prices ... (more)"

This is also similar to how insurance work they take other insured money to pay. Like that might as well call everything ponzi scheme. The driver dont like cpf thats why he say its ponzi scheme.0 comments1"
