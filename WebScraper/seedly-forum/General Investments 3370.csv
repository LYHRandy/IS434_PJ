WizardAnswered on 18 Sep 2018For blogs wise, I would highly recommend the blogs found on this list here:​ https://blog.seedly.sg/financial-blogs-singaporeans-should-be-reading/​​For videos, I don't really think you can get the best content as most are US based :) We may be creating some content for the video generation. You can see some of the FB LIVEs we have done before: https://www.facebook.com/pg/seedlysg/videos/​For books, I personally read Rich Dad Poor Dad, And realised that there were two ways to build wealth.Learn to invest (and make money work for you)Start a businessIn my army days, I did 1) for awhile and asked my brother to buy local stocks for me but got burnt. Hence I went to learn to start a business, soon after, the startup wave started catching fire and thereafter, I went on that path instead :)​Other people would recommend these familiar books:A Random Walk Down Wall StreetOne Up On Wall StreetThe Intelligent InvestorBerkshire Hathaway Letters to ShareholdersThe Little Books Of Common Sense Investing​For me, after the advent of the internet and the mobile wave, I would recommend the following:Listening to podcasts instead about business and how the economy worksReading content on personal finance websites or bloggers to figure out how they started growingThis is espeically important because it usually would be more localised :)0 comments0"
