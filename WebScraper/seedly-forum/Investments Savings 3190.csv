1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 26 Oct 2018Save first... Get at least 6 months worth of rainy day funds, then invest the excess beyond that.Rainy day funds is basically 6 months worth of fixed expenses and necessities (eg rent, water, food, utilities, insurance premiums etc) Yup! So the steps would be: Save up enough that cover 6 months of your rainy day fundsInvest the balance beyond that by a Dollar cost average method (DCA)Or if you see that the market is down now, you can choose Lump Sum invest (LSI)And adopt this method you see here monthly: You can read more about this here: https://blog.seedly.sg/working-adults-allocate-your-monthly-salary/0 comments0"

3,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 26 Oct 2018Like what Gabriel said, why not both? It's not supposed to be a choice between both of them.Also, 'better' in terms of what? It depends on your personal preference. If you prefer to let your money stay in the bank and not take risks, then of course saving up is better. Of course, you'll lose money every year because the bank's basic interest rate is so low; can't even match inflation.0 comments0"
4,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 26 Oct 2018Why not both? Maybe you can invest between 5 to 10 percent of your income and save up the rest in a high interest savings account like DBS Multiplier, UOB One or CIMB FastSaver 0 comments0"
