Grand MasterAnswered 2w agoI still like Keppel DC Reits.It's different from the usual REITS, not a shopping mall, not office space.It's focused on data centres, which is the thing powering all the apps we are using. Something that has longevity.I would not put all my money in, of course, a small portion of it in my REITS.(And REITS is a small component of my overall stocks, just for the fun of it, personally I don't hold too many REITS as the returns are stable but low)0 comments0"
