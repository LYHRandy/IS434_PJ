God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hey Anon, SSBs yields are a little low and coupons are paid out bi-annually. If you're looking for some regular passive income, you may want to consider high yield dividend paying funds. I suggest looking at some High Yield Corporate Bond funds. Dividends of 6-7% are quite common. They pay monthly, and are less risky than investing in equities as well.2 comments2"
2,"Question Poster06 Apr 2019How do you start investing on high yield corporate bonds? Is it like ssb also low risk kind? Sorry I am very new to these.Hariz Arthur Maloy06 Apr 2019If you know what to look for, you can get them on fund supermart. If not you can speak to an FA like myself. Its definitely not as low risk like SSB because that's government backed by our AAA rated Govt. But the fund buys bonds from individual companies. It holds hundreds of bonds at the same time and you can get access from as low as 1k."

This SSB is not going to give u huge extra income. It will be better than bank deposit rates at least. I am not sure of your definition of extra income, so I will give you the safer recommendation.4 comments0"
5,"See all 4 comments Gabriel Tham05 Apr 2019Banks have hurdle accounts that give attractive interest rates based on salary+spend. But if you have small capital and don't spend alot, I guess SSB makes a good choice. You can still construct a SSB ladder, buy 6 consecutive months of SSB and soon you will get SSB money every month.

Or you could take some risk and invest into dividend stocks/ETFs but there is risk.Question Poster06 Apr 2019Do you think ssb or high yield corporate bonds is better?? Like safe and low to no risk kind"
