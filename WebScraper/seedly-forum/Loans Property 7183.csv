1,"Ken TanLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 04 Jun 2018when you refinance home loan, you are basically changing banks to get the same loan at a lower rate.â€‹for home equity loan, you are using your home as a collateral to get more funds out. Similar to a credit line.â€‹Would probably need more details before giving advice.â€‹Example.Some of my clients who have fully paid landed property, took home equity loan to leverage out at a very low interest rate and used that money for other investment. In this way, they can use the current low investment environment to generate more passive income and perhaps even invest in another property if their finances allows.â€‹â€‹0 comments1"
