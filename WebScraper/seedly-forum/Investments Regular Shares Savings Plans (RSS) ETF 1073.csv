1,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019You cannot directly transfer the RSP holdings to your CDP account.DBS does not provide that option. The only thing you can do is stop the monthly RSP or sell all your holdings.I suggest to just keep it there if you want to stop investing in the RSP. At least this way you still get the dividends and potential future capital gains.2 comments0"
2,"Question Poster04 Jun 2019Hi Gabriel! Thanks for responding. Actually I saw that DBS has a transfer of rsp-etf form, I thought it allows for transfer to CDP account but there will be a fee of ard $11 involved.Gabriel Tham04 Jun 2019Ah cool, didn't know DBS RSP had that option. But I still think you should just keep it there unless you really need the money. The account is in your name so unless DBS goes bust or something, it should be safe. The fees are not worth too since ETF dont have AGM for you to attend."
