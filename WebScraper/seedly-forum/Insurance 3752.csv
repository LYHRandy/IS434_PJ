God of WisdomAnswered on 02 Jul 2019A Personal Accident Plan only pays out on accidental death. The Grup Term Life pays out on normal death, doesn't have to be cause of accident.So they are different and cannot be compared directly. You can compare the AIA Pa 100 to the Group PA Plan. I'd be more inclined to choose a private policy because at least it belongs to me and not the group.0 comments2"

ProdigyAnswered on 02 Jul 2019Honestly your question is quite broad so it's hard to nail a specific answer as each insurance type /or instrument is designed for different personal needs. For fixed term, you pay a small premium (till you reach an old age) that gives you high leverage in the case you suffer something unfortunate. It's all sunk cost if you live on perfectly till age 65 I believe.For whole life, you pay a decent premium but only for a fixed period of time (usually 20 years) but you get to surrender your policy and get back the money + interest depending how long you intend to keep the policy for post maturity. So for people who are better off, they may consider using whole insurance as a catch all, using it as both an endowment plan but also one to provide death, total disability and critical illness coverage. Regardless what you choose, starting early is the best advice anyone can give to you because insurance act as your shield of defence as you build up tools (income, investment among others) to build wealth. My other advice would be to add early stage critical illness, accident and hospitalization riders to cover all basis. If you want to take one step beyond, you can consider income protection but that will be based on additional premium to pay and that is all sunk cost (similar as term plan).0 comments1"
