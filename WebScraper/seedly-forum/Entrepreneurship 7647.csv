Especially in the age of data where we are empowered with information to buy direct (and avoid paying the layers and layers of fees to others in the network)For me, anyone should buy a product only if it provides value for them, not if a ''friend"" is coercing them to buy it.0 comments2"

MasterAnswered 4w agoNetwork marketing structure has an inherent weakness(1) distributors or the lower tier are not earning enough to support themselves (unless they are just buying the product for usage, and if that happens, congrats, that's your gold mine).(2) The network dies off if there are no genuine users of the product(3) Normally the product is a costly alternative, hence you need a value premium to justify the cost.(4) not easy to scale if people do not believe in the product.It's a paper theory that it can earn money. but try it, and you will understand the difficulties, and if you can overcome them, you hit your goldmine.0 comments0"
