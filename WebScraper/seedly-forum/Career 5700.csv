1,"SShieleenLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 03 Jul 2019Go ahead, let your mother learn a new skill! Assuming 67yo as retirement age for her, she has at least another 10 - 20+ years in her career life. So, why not?  Career pathway and salary range in Early childhood education & development sector is very straightforward and rather transparent. Start looking for more information on ECDA website. A few checks for your mum to consider:
1) Motivation to take up the course (for fun, just feel like attending or serious in committing to a job in future?) 
2) Motivation to take up the role when she decided to enroll into the course. 
3) What is her priority in taking up a job assuming she pass the course? E.g. salary, location, or factors she cannot really control such as company culture and relationship with colleagues etc. If not continuing in an admin job, what skills does she have to pick up another job? Facing the reality, the ball is still in employers’ court, it will be difficult to find a job where all her expectations or criteria can be met. Hence, adaptive / interpersonal skills makes a whole lot of difference. Besides, admin role is so easily replaceable. Accountant job scope is pretty similar, she can ask for higher salary if her skills and value to employer can justify the price tag she asked for.Be realistic in expectations and do your homework/research to avoid similar workplace issues or reasons for leaving again.0 comments3"
2,"Eric Chia, Senior Financial Consultant at PrudentialLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 03 Jul 2019Hi I'm assuming your mom doesn't need to support the family, she's working to pass time and/or to cover her own expenses.Leaving the first job at 41 is no easy thing. She would have felt a great sense of lost in purpose and direction in her career. She needs a lot of encourage and confidence getting back in the work force. Encourage her to search for her passion.Understand how she feels the past 3 years moving around different jobs. Ask what makes her happy and what doesn't. Also help her find and focus on what she enjoys the most.If childhood education is what she likes then please support her idea. Money shouldn't be the key driving factor.However, if she really needs the income, then have to consider the ""investment returns"" on going for the early childhood course, I.e. how much it would cost her and how long it would take for the repayment of course fees if a loan should be taken. The course fees divided by expected monthly income increment from her current job should be less than 1 year (I.e. ROI on course fees should be less than 1 year).If ROI is greater than 1 year, she's better off looking for better paying job.Also do note the ROI benchmark will differ based on the length of course.0 comments0"
