God of WisdomAnswered on 05 Oct 2018Dude, you're an FA, you should know these things. ​While many have already provided good alternatives, I would instead suggest you to focus more on producing more and improving your skills as an FA.​You can focus on saving money or making more. I always choose to focus on making more. And you are in the best position to do that literally overnight. Sales. ​All the best friend and good luck on the career, we need more good people here.

2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Oct 2018Safer choices. Ssb will be perfect for the 10 year duration. Same can be said for high interest yielding savings accounts (cimb fastsaver or citibank's maxi gain). Riskier choices will be basket of s-reits and blue chip stocks, or an options portfolio (30% pa and upwards). You may want to consider contributing to your OA account as well to grow the funds for your housing. Hope this helps and all the best 0 comments0"
