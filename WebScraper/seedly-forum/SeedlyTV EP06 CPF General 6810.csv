1,"CPF BoardLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Jun 2019Hi,CPF LIFE is a life annuity, this means members can receive a regular stream of income for as long as they live and not worry of outliving their savings. When members pass on, any unused CPF LIFE annuity premium (without interest) and Retirement Account savings, will be paid to their beneficiaries.Thank you.0 comments7"

3,"See all 4 comments Question Poster13 Jun 2019Yes. what happens if there is no more funds left in the person's cpf and he or she is still living?Clarence Chua15 Jun 2019If the person is on CPF Life, the payouts are guaranteed till death. It is also not possible for the CPF monies of a person to run out before going to CPF life, as monies in SA are not usable (lest for the investment I mentioned above) until retirement.

However, if the person is on Retirement Sum Scheme, he/she will need to opt in to CPF Life"

God of WisdomAnswered on 12 Jun 2019If you are on CPF Life, your payouts will last for as long as you live.And if you want a higher payout, you can opt for the Enhanced Retirement Sum on a standard plan. Today, for someone that is 55, that will give them about 2k/mth from 65 onwards.0 comments2"
5,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Jun 2019This question only affects people under the Retirement Sum Scheme (Old scheme not under CPF LIFE).If you are age 62 and above now, you are definitely not under CPF LIFE. You will be required to OPT IN to CPF LIFE ro have gauranteed payouts for LIFE.If let's say, you are under the Retirement Sum Scheme, by age 95, you will likely have depleted all your CPF monies, and will require support from the government to fund your living, or you have to head back to work.Since every $30,000 gives you $100 a month, meaning to say, if you have $150,000 you will have gauranteed $500 a month for life.The only way to prevent drawdown of capital is to only use your interest earned from CPF RA and to throw back any amount drawn back into RA to have a pepetual annuity (maybe through your kids etc) etc.0 comments0"
