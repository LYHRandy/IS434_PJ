1,"Javier Lim, Financial Consultant at Prudential Assurance Company SingaporeLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 05 Aug 2019From what i have gathered, they usually only accept policies between 10 to 20/25 years since inception. Usually the surrender values then are not high, so it's kinda like buying an undervalued property.Of course another way of looking at it is that they are buying into the death benefit of the life assured and/or the participating subfund that the plan is written with.1 comment6"

for Reps Holding and all, they do take the non-gauranteed portion. But if you need more info or is willing to look for partnership, do contact me on such arrangements.2 comments0"
4,"T@Takingstock @15 Aug 2019Have thought about this, but maybe not yet. Its a decent alternative to bonds (including SSB) but I think I can do better with reits. Need to consider the net balance between all the available tools. 

I am comfortable with stocks / reits and SSBs for now.Loh Tat Tian15 Aug 2019No problem. Its quite easy to ""cut loss"" too if you find that the returns are not as good or fall below your projection."
