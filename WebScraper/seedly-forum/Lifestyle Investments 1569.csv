1,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Apr 2019The idea that ""laziness"" and ""investments"" come together without the appropriate amount of starting capital is an unfortunate lie that is purported by many get rich quick method sellers. Contrary to belief, investments are not ""lazy"", the closest thing I can think of it being lazy is being passive, and being a passive investor will not be able to get you the investment return you need to sustain a lifestyle. If you are investing passively, you most likely will be indexing- and indexing modestly give you about 8% year;y(on average here, there will be some years you get negative return). If you put in $100 000, you only get a $8000 return - can you survive on $8000 a year? Maybe, but it will be pushing it, no doubt, if you don't pay for any insurance, bills, rent etc. and only pay for your own food.If you go and actively manage your own investments, you won't be lazing at home anymore - everyday will be a hustle to pick the right stocks and reading of annual reports in order to put food on the table. Of course, there are those that have done so, and become stay at home day traders, but the way is littered with the bodies of many who failed as well, and have ended up with nothing. What if you bought into the wrong stocks as well? A big investment into something like the hyflux incident will also evaporate your hard earned capital.TLDR: Unless you have a huge amount of capital like a million dollars for you to passively invest in an index that can help you earn 8% modestly, or for more security into bonds (at a lower return), it is extremely difficult to stay at home without a job and expect the investments to generate a good enough return for you to live comfortably. I think investments should be something that helps you supplement your basic income, and to make money work hard while idling for your retirement, and shouldn't be entirely depended on for a regular joe like me or you.0 comments2"

3,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 17 Apr 2019Sad to burst your bubble ah....investing you also need some capital. Money will not magically appear for you unless you somehow have a huge inheritance that allows you to laze at home and no need to find a job.If you do have a huge inheritance waiting for you, then invest wisely and don't waste it.Else it is time to find ways to get capital to invest.0 comments1"
4,"Leong Wen FongLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Apr 2019Agree with Gabriel here. If you think investments are a great way to make a quick buck, you're wrong. If it really was, then everyone would be doing it. Of course, there are times where people really get lucky with it, but if you treat it that way, then it's no different than gambling. Be in gambling or investing, you still need to start with some capital.Investing takes time to learn, to read up (unless it's like SSB/fixed D, but even so, you need to know which one helps you the most). Even choosing the right savings account/credit card, the people here are willing to read up and do some research, so I don't think you'll find an easy answer to your question0 comments0"
