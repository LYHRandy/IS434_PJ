1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Feb 2019Building up on Hariz's reply, derivatives in isolation are essentially worthless and derive financial value from an underlying asset(s) tracked.  There are many different types of derivatives- most popular for retail investors being options and futures.Derivatives can very easily magnify loses and gains-making it a very dangerous tool- especially to uninformed investors.Used properly however, Derivatives can be used by shareholders to manage exposure and hedge against risks. Covered calls and protective puts- are just some of the strategies people use to minimize their exposure to downside risk! 0 comments2"

God of WisdomAnswered on 22 Feb 2019Derivatives are contracts made on speculating the future price of an asset or commodity.They aren't dangerous in the right hands, but for those who don't exactly know what they're doing, some derivatives have unlimited downside protection. The most common derivatives are options and futures contracts.You can learn more on investopedia. :) 0 comments1"
3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Feb 2019Derivatives are basically financial instruments that derive their value from their underlying instrument. I gave the example of wine being a derivative of grapes in my previous sharing on seedly on options on stocks. Dangerous perhaps, if you don't know what you are doing with them. You can have unlimited liability if you did not structure your positions correctly. But when used correctly, it can create income that is unparalleled when compared to traditional buy and hold strategy. Personally I'm managing an options portfolio generating 60% returns pa that will allow me to retire early.  0 comments0"
4,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 23 Feb 2019I think ""dangerous"" is quite relative. It probaly depends on what kinds of derivatives you have, the market for derivatives, the underlying assets they are based on and like what others have mentioned, the investors themselves. I personally know people who have burnt quite a sum of their savings by playing with options. I guess they were just looking to make a quick buck!0 comments0"
