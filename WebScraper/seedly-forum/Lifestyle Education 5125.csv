1,"Bertrand Wong, Reward Specialist at Schneider ElectricLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 20 Oct 2018I think the academic rigour that we experienced, which has been influenced by the education system and high expectation from our parents, has probably translated into our steadfast attitude towards learning and mastering our proficiency in picking up new skills. The high standards and structured academic system has challenged us to excel at what we do, and we are naturally inclined with this strong need to develop ourselves continuously for the purpose of being a better version of ourselves. Just my 2 cents based on my experience.0 comments0"
