1,"DeleteEditElijah LeeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 26 Jun 2019Probably just me, but I actually enjoy spending on stocks and UTs and the like, and so I find them worth my money and time. I have a goal to be financially free the moment I graduated and I have not lost sight of it. (Didn't have a time frame for that though, although things are starting to crystallize now). The adrenaline rush when I get a stock at the price I want or buy into a good UT to average down prices probably is the same as when someone buys a physical item like a bag or a car. Maybe that's why I am in my current job!That aside, your question made think deeper and I would say I do spend on my hobbies as well. Once in a while I also ensure my family and loved ones can have a good meal during occasions like birthdays. Of course I would ensure that I don't break the bank doing so. It's all about budget, planning and control.1 comment11"

1. Nutrition - by this, I mean nutritionally dense foods. So for $5, I would choose protein and fibre from the cai png stall, as opposed to bubble tea.
Long term benefits:  Good health, mental clarity etc etc. 2. Exercise - this can be free, but I have found that spending money to learn from good instructors is very helpful. Their advice helps to push you beyond what you thought was possible, and all in a safe way. I can count the number of times I have seen people doing poor form in big gyms, and this counts towards potentially injuring themselves in the process.
Long term benefits: Strength and mobility as I get older 3. Investments - this includes anything from big ticket items like high rental yield free-hold property, to equities. I definitely favour putting money into things that grow.
Long term benefits:  Hopefully a growing investment portfolio ;) 4. Memories with loved ones - this is where I am probably the most extravagant with my money. I have no qualms bringing for eg. my dad on a Japan trip and checking out good food places, because I know all these count towards memories.
Long term benefits:  Treasuring time with loved ones.0 comments1"
