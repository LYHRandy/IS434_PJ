question,"SeedlyTV EP01 Education Career Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 27 Mar 2019I'm 19, female, and just entering university this year. I'm really interested in finance (especially investments). Any advice on how to get a head start in Uni? CCAs, mods, self-study? I feel it a really huge transferable skill set to both my own life + any other place I might think about working for, and I really wish to make the most of my time in Uni. Also, is it tough for girls to enter the industry? Btw, I'm planning to enter NUS this year, Business! Any tips for me would be greatly appreciated!!!!4 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 27 Mar 2019ModsI agree with Jonathan that your mods may not teach you much about investments, especially having taken some finance mods myself and having talked to others. From what others say, your first accounting mod and finance mod give you a good foundation on how to look at financial statements and basic invesment concepts like time value of money and financial statment analysis. CCAsLike what the rest have said, CCAs can give you some help in starting to invest. But I would think that learning on your own can be much more helpful also, to complement what you learn. What you can do before UniIf I were you, reading books about finance such as the Intelligent Investor, or taking online courses on Cousera or Udemy can give you a starting point before school actually starts. I actually know friends who started investing on FX just by reading books. They even have others passing them money to invest in FX, so they have become mini fund managers. The internet has a wealth of resources already, so you don't neccessarily have to wait for school to start before learning.0 comments2"
2,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Mar 2019If i could turn back time I definitely would have joined the investment club and/or investment banking club in your particular university of choice. Coming from NUS, there is a main investment club (NUSInvest) that has a global macro division, equity research division and analytics division for the investment related activities, so definitely if you are extremely interested in investing in equities then perhaps you should try out for their equity research division when you enter and their sign ups begin. Just take note that you'll have to have some form of prior knowledge, it won't just be a "" go in and have a general interview"", it's more of a serious interest club so they'll expect applicants to do a stock recommendation as their entrance criteria. However, getting in has alot of perks because you'll be surrounded by like minded individuals that can help you along your journey, as well as provide you important networking contacts for your future!So, read up on accounting, understand the 3 financial statements and their uses in evaluation of firm performances, and just be up to date with the general going ons in the economy. As for whether it is hard to break into the industry, I think as long as you have the passion for what you do, we are all treated equally in the eyes of the interviewer. Most of the time it is mainly because the investment side is more traditionally male dominated, but if you're good at it, then you'll have no trouble breaking in!0 comments0"
3,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 27 Mar 2019Hello!Im currently in NUS business, and just like you im interested in finance and plan to speclialise in it! What I would recommend you to do in uni would be to join investment clubs such as NUS investment society, or go for any invesment sessions that are being held. For me, I stay in one of the residential colleges and they have weekly investment sessions held which I attend when I am free. It has helped me to better understand about investments. On top of joining CCAs, another way would be to read up about  the basics of investing online like reading investopedia, investment blogs etc. In terms of uni life, I personally feel that time management is of utmost importance when it comes to juggling your studies and any CCAs or hall commitments that you have.Hope this helps and all the best in your studies! Enjoy your uni life!0 comments0"
4,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 27 Mar 2019Joining investment clubs will be a good idea. Can learn and share among your fellow peers who are also keen on investing. Other than joining investment workshops, there's not really much else you can do on your own, especially if you want to succeed fast. Modules will focus on theory which may not translate well in real life investments. Can investment theory teach you how to achieve 30% roi a year? Good to know for the background but personally I feel it's just to gain a perspective. As for barriers to entry, I don't think it's impossible. Boils down to how hungry you are to make it in the industry and achieve your career goals. Hope this helps and all the best in your upcoming studies and investment journey.0 comments0"
