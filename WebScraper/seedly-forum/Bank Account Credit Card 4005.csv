Not just DBS, but almost every bank in Singapore now has an automated system to waive off the credit card fees or other fees. They do not want their customer service officers to spend time on this too.You just call the hotline listed at the back of your credit card, and the automated telephone system eventually will have a ""Press X if you are calling to waive off your credit card fees""Bonus: no talking needed!0 comments1"
