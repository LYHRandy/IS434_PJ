1,"Cassandra ThoLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 13 Jun 2019Hey there! I’m Cassandra, the community manager for CoAssets Pte Ltd. As everyone has already mentioned below, Singapore saving bonds (SSB) are probably the best and most secure passive income investments. Your capital and interest is guaranteed by the Singapore Government, which has a AAA-rating. Although it’s a money back guarantee, a single person cannot own more than $200,000 (Since 1 Feb 2019) worth of SSB. Redemption is also flexible with no penalty. Principal and any accrued interest will be paid in multiples of $500 monthly. Source: Singapore Savings Bond Fac Sheet You can apply through ATM or internet banking via UOB OCBC or DBS, alternatively, one can also use the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS). Yields are considered low at 2.16% for May 2019’s SSB for the next 10 years (1.95% for 1 year). However, they are comparatively higher than interest rates by the banks. You can check out this post for the interest rates: https://blog.seedly.sg/best-savings-accounts-singapore/Depending on the definition of long term investments, P2P lending could be another platform to diversify one’s investment portfolio.
P2P lending is another passive income investment that one may consider “best”, due to it’s higher rate of returns. i.e. CoAssets Pte Ltd has a weighted average of 9.91%, Moohlahsense at 9.9% and Funding Societies at 9.32% just to name a few. It is definitely not as secure as P2P investing is considered a high-risk investment. The risk is also dependent on each individual’s risk appetite, where loans are being funded to and the type of financing options. With Singapore’s reputation as a major financial and technological hub, there is a growing interest for P2P lending.Hope this helps :)0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 07 Jun 2019Although reits might come to minds of many when one mentions passive long-term, one must forecast market conditions in a year's time. At this rate, many speak of recession which might lead to interest rates being cut thereby lessening the burden of reits. However in a growth / inflationary market whereby interest rates are growing, one needs to select reits that are able to still shine in such an environment.0 comments1"

Do have REITs that have property in SG and some other REITs in overseas too, as to diversify a little.It will be a stable and steady passive income, do allocate more in bonds as you grow wiser. This is to further reduce risk depending on your style.0 comments0"

Backed by the government and gives at least 4% for Special Account and it will provide you passive income when you are 65. Although government may change the rules from time to time.0 comments0"
9,Tan Wei MingLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 06 Jun 2019Currently the best and most secure passive income investments would be government bonds. Singapore Savings Bond and 2.7% Temasek Bond are one of the two safest bonds you can consider.0 comments0
