God of WisdomAnswered 3w agoIf you are buying to hope for a capital gain upon listing, then I would be careful not to be overly optimistic. Not all IPOs 'pop' on listing (think UBER).For myself, an IPO is a way for me to participate in a stock that I believe (after analysis) will give me good returns (either capital gain or dividends) in the long run, provided that I believe it is fairly valued. If a company is well managed then there is no reason to not hold on to the stock.0 comments7"

Most of the time, a company went for an IPO when the company looking to do fundraising.
And first questions to ask is, what is the objective of fundraising?Is it for business expansions? or is it for debt repayment?Most of the time, for business expansion, is more preferable as it also means that the company found ways to grow the company further, where investors would have an opportunity to have investment return later on.Next, if the company is for business expansions, then the next question is to ask what is their current company situation, and with the fund how the company could grow the company further.This is a tougher questions to find out, where you would have to do more research and understand the ability of the company to grow the company further.
Lastly is what is the valuation of the companyIn IPO, the owner is selling his ownership of the company. As a seller, they would seek to sell at a higher price. Hence, it is more likely a company to price it high when they go IPO, as they would price in future growth. But not to say that the company couldn't grow further, take an example like Facebook when they go for IPO, they valuations is almost 100 times PE. However, due to the fast growth, and company moat, it grows even further over the years.If you like to find out what are the metrics to look at a growth company, you may find it in this series of the article: https://wealthpark.io/articles/how-to-find-best-growth-stocks-1/0 comments1"

Generally, for tech companies, it seems like the share price can go both ways drastically, and thus banking on it for capital gain might not seem like a good idea...
