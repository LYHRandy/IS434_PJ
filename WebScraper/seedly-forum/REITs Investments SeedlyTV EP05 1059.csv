3,"Question Poster02 Jun 2019I kinda like this 2 reits including the industries they are in. Provided that I have only 2k, would it be better if I invest in Q1P to have more shares and better dividend payout?Tan Wei Ming02 Jun 2019If I am not wrong the valuation for the hospitality reit is at P/B 1 or lower which is definitely cheaper than MCT. You should look at the historical distributions for the hospitality reit to see if it is growing YOY. I kinda avoid hospitality reit because it is really very cyclical so doesnt provide the stability that MCT provides."
