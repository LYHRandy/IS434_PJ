2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Jun 2019Are you investing for growth or for dividend income? If you are investing for growth, frankly the local market has been flat for many years. And if you want to get into Etfs, look into a globally diversified one instead.If for dividend income, the local reit market is quite excellent. Only thing now is that the prices are a bit high. Monitor the spread between the nav and the current price and move in to buy when the spread is at lowest.0 comments0"
