question,"Retirement Asked by AnonymousAsked on 15 Nov 2018How can I start saving-cum-investing after wiping out my savings in housing?I am not a financially savvy person and find it hard to learn investing. So, I am considering low-to-middle risk investment, such as REIT. Furthermore, Iâ€™m going to be 40 years old, so I have shorter time to save for retirement.3 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Nov 2018Mm perhaps you can attend a workshop on reits like what Dr wealth is offering. Covers some fundamentals and how to evaluate a reit. May be a good starting point for you. Financial savviness can be taught; you need to be hungry enough to learn. As you don't have much time towards retirement, you may require a lot of capital to invest into reits to achieve meaningful distribution income that can afford you a comfortable retirement. The other alternative I can think of in view of the tight time span will be riskier, but returns are much higher. That is find a mentor to guide you on how to manage an options portfolio. You can achieve returns upwards of 30% or more. But before doing all these, as Brandan mentioned in another comment, do ensure that your protection and medical coverage are in place before embarking on your investment journey. Hope this helps 0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 16 Nov 2018Well, Retirement is like climbing a flight of stairs, its much easier in your 20s and gets significantly harder post 40s.Increasing your savings means you need to reduce your spending.1) set out a monthly savings goal2) With that plan out your weekly budget, and try not to exceed it.3) spend some time researching and understanding more about your investment options, try to diversify your options so u have multiple streams of income instead of just Reits and CPF life4) Ensure that before you start investing, you have your insurance covered, and have already set aside of funds for emergency.If you would like to have a deeper discussion, feel free to drop me a PM via Facebook. www.facebook.com/brandan.chen0 comments0"
