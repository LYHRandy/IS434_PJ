And you can't compare them.DigiPortfolio is a globally diversified portfolio built with multiple ETFs to achieve that exposure. Based on your risk profile and investment horizon, you would be recommended a portfolio with asset allocation in both stocks and bonds.The STI ETF is just one ETF that invests in the largest 30 stocks in Singapore.So think of it this way. DigiPortfolio is like a full meal with lots of different meats and veggies. Sourced from all over the world.STI ETF is just one chicken wing. You can have a whole plate of chicken wings sure, but that's all you're eating. And all the chicken from the chicken wings was bred in just one country. Whether or not it's going to be very nice, depends.0 comments1"
