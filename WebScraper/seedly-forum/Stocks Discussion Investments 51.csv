Grand MasterAnswered 4w agoI didn't subscribe but do read their free articles.My feel is that they recommend TOO MANY stocks to be a useful and effective stock advisor.I recommend 100 stocks that are good, I am sure at least a small basket will be great, then I will tell everyone I am a great stock picker =)2 comments0"
2,"SISufrie Ishak 4w agoIf you have actually tried subscribing it, you'll know that they only recommend one new stock each month. And so far, a majority of their recommendations are doing very well. Do note that they recommend investing for the long term.Cedric Jamie Soh4w agoThank You for sharing the 1 stock per mont! i still don't understand why they have to go write for so many stocks daily (for the overall website)... its too much for me. :)"
