1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 23 Mar 2019It depends on the stage at which the private company is at as well. Coming from a Venture Capitalist perspective, a very simple thought flow is as such:Let's say that an early stage Software-as-a-Service is raising at 5x price to sales. You look at comparables and see that other similar companies have raised at 3x P/S. Based on this, you then need to evaluate other factors such as quality of team (are they serial entrepreneurs who have exited successfully before?), Technical due-diligence of their product (is it really superior?), the veracity of their go-to-market strategy.It is also common to tri-age this with other valuation mehods, but if you are looking at a super early stage startup, it could be challenging as financial historicals are limited.0 comments2"

Grand MasterAnswered on 10 Jun 2019Tons of stuff but let me touch only on 1:-The talents running the company.The founders, the current operating teams. These are the real gems of the company.  There are many instances where big companies swallowed a start up for the sake of the talents.And many times the startup will fail if the talents leave.Always look at the company and analyse, will the company still be as valuable without the core team now?0 comments1"
3,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Mar 2019A comparable company analysis is a common private company valuation method. The comps table will include a group of companies that share similar characteristics to the company in question in terms of size, industry and oeprations. Multiples are then calculated from the companies to calculate the industry average which is then used to compare against the company's.0 comments1"
4,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Mar 2019Definitely industry averages and competitor relative valuations. The relative stock prices and performance indicators like return on equity, return on assets, profit margins eg. of a close publically traded competitor, of similar capital structure is a very good indicator how well a company should be doing and how much the value of a stock should be priced (if you are looking at valuating a private company IPO). IAfter all, how well you do is all depending on how well you do compared to another person. If the industry is doing badly, but you are doing the least badly, you in fact are doing extremely well! So always take a look at how they compare in terms of their balance sheet and cash flows. But of course, private companies have less requirements to post about their own financial standings as compared to a public company, so you may not be privy to all the information... just take note!0 comments0"
