3,"Josh NgLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 02 Jul 2019Had I not read your additional context around you sticking around for 5 years to get that bonus, my straight answer would be yes - stick to current and be smart about the timing.My hunch is the fact that you are already thinking about moving goes to show that you are not learning as much as you would desire to, or acquiring skill sets that are relevant to the changing ecosystem. In that regard, I would advise moving (only if you have thought hard about what you want i.e. skill sets to develop, the right growing sector) and have found a suitable opportunity. Personally I won't be too caught up with the money as you are still relatively young and as the saying goes: your income goes up when the value you bring goes up. In fact, sometimes it can grow exponentially. There are enough cases I've seen where individuals' career leap off when they make the right decisions (kind of similar what you are experiencing now). There is no absolute guidance on what you should do, as with the limited information that you have provided but I would lend on the side that as long as you are learning, you are already better off than staying still. Good luck with your part time uni :)0 comments2"
4,"Yuenice LinLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 19 Jun 2019First of all, would recommend you to atleast finish your part time uni before any change of career. Once you have completed your uni, you could consider approaching your boss to ask for better pay / a review of your prospect in the company. If boss sees a future with you in the company, you may choose to stay. If not, start looking for opportunity else where. Find a new job that gives you better prospect and pay before you quit.1 comment2"
5,"Eric Chia19 Jun 2019Agreed that you should finish the part time university first. Ultimately, you need to search your passion. What do you like to do for your career?"
6,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 20 Jun 2019It is never too late for a career change. Ultimately it's your life and you should decide what you want to do in your time. Besides, 32 years old is considered pretty young, especially considering the fact that people are potentially looking at lifespans of 80-90 these days.From a bigger picture perspective, what do you want to do? This would help guide your thinking of whether you want to change your job or not.0 comments1"

9,"Irving SohLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 23 Jun 2019Ask yourself first what you want to be doing 5 years down the line everything else is just noise. Follow what you love as long as it makes practical sense. If it doesn't, then find a path that's both practical and that you can live with. Bonuses, schools, working experience has very little to no effect long term. Unless you're a doctor or a lawyer in a special niche, years of exp won't make much diff if ur not up to par. And you'll only ever be up to par in a place you feel motivated to work in outside of monetary rewards.0 comments0"
10,"Steph Yeo, Auntie Uncle Whisperer at Agency for Integrated CareLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 19 Jun 2019Maybe think about your motivation behind wanting a career change? Is it a push or pull factor? Not sure it's enough to say you ""want a new experience"". If your current role allows you to do your part time uni with minimal distractions, I'd think it's wise to stay till you're done with the degree before moving. After the degree, if you still wanna explore, you may want to consider requesting for a different role in the same company for a different experience, or really find another company.0 comments0"
