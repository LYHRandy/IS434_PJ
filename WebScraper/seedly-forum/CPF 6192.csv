question,"CPF Asked by AnonymousAsked on 27 Apr 2019Is there a limit for Medisave claims for medical bills in a year?I would have to undergo a few dental procedures, including wisdom tooth surgery. I know some of them are claimable through Medisave. I would be doing each procedure seperately. So I would like to know if there is a limit to the payment through Medisave in a year.1 answerAnswerBump0"

Bone Graft, Gum surgery, sinus liftThe Medisave withdrawal limits are different for each procedure.For example for wisdom tooth surgery, the more teeth you are required to remove, the higher your withdrawal limit. The complexity of the surgery will also affect your withdrawal limit (tooth division/bone removal)For a clearer clarification for your own case, you should check with the clinic staff, they will be knowledgeable in this aspect.
