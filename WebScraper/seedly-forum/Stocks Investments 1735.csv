MasterAnswered on 08 Apr 2019My parents are more comfortable with a guaranteed sum of money at their age, so I set a guaranteed amount/yield like 5% or something and keep the rest. I also have to pay them during losses though, but it all works out like leverage. There are similar strategies you can adopt from me if youre interested.  https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
