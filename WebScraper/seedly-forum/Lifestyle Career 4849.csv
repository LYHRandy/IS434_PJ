God of WisdomAnswered on 01 May 2019Think active income instead of passive income.A side hustle or a weekend job are great ways to make more money. Also, pick up skills that people are willing to pay for.This could be coding, running advertisements, even making birthday cards. (my gf sold a 3D bday card on carousell)All these a great ways to add a few hundred dollars to your pocket each week. :)0 comments1"

Seek out knowledge and improve yourself professionally.Save up to build a safety net and also see if your new company provides medical insurance coverage. Exercise and invest in your health. Use your free time to continue growing your skillset, in order to maximise your earning power as fast as you can. 
Also read up on financial management and educate yourself. Open a high interest rate savings account.
As your income grows, set aside amounts to invest in RSPs or SSBs for a start.0 comments1"
