1,"Candy GohLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 06 Jul 2019Yes, I've heard of it and I know some friends who has been through it and highly encourage me to go for it. From the little I understand, this paid course is very intense and it will make you increase in self-awareness to explore personal growth via stepping out of your comfort zones. Think of: You crying because you have to face things you might have sub-conciously hid for a long time.  Yep. From my friends' good reviews, it seems like a life-changing course, but one you must be willing to be open to change, if not don't waste your money. You will probably also gain a new supportive community (imagine seeing each others' vulnerability and growing through discomfort together!)I'm curious regarding why some people mention it's brain-washing and give bad reviews. Would love to hear your experiences.1 comment0"
