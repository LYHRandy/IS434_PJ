1,Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 30 Nov 2018A degree can be a general degree or a specialised degree.

I think some of the education or career fairs would be helpful.2 comments0"

Mind telling me a bit of what you do, and the good and bad about it?Yk Lai28 Nov 2018I studied materials engineering, have a MBA. I work in semiconductor manufacturing. The good thing is it is a high tech company, frequently grab the news headline in the Wall Street.
