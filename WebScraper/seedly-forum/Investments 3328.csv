1,"Dwivid SharmaLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 26 Sep 2018Hi there,​I would love to help you about Singapore airline stock. Nowadays, SIA stocks is under selling presure due to hike of crude oil price and trade war among China and The U.S.But I can see good opportunity in near future for this stock. It is almost near to its strong support, from where it had taken good comeback.​Most of the famous indicators showing up trend in near future.

Airlines are generally very thin margin businesses with little pricing power (think about how most people choose their airlines). 0 comments1"

Similar to other transport, people want cheap, good and fast. ​Last time taxi is expensive but comes grab and uber so now is abit cheaper.​Now have many cheaper flight to take. When oil price increase, it is hard to increase price because people will just take the cheapest and good one.0 comments0"

ProdigyAnswered on 15 Sep 2018I think one important consideration you will need to note will be the on-going litigation between SIA and it's pilots (especially with the rise of airport tax and expansion of route plans). The oil price hike is also another factor that may eat up the operating expense. ​0 comments0
