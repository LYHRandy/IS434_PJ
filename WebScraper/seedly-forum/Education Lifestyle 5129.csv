1,"Ronald SzieLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I will say exams are good way to provide a standard to understand how well do you understand. However, the current examinations in schools only cover a narrow aspect ot learning (e.g. Language, Math, Science...) and these determines what secondary school/college and universitt will they enter. There are so much more stuff ( communications, leadership, business...) that a person learns, yet there is no system to capture them. The whole system will need to incorporate more than just academic examinations as criteria for selection, otherwise the old mindset will still remain.1 comment1"

3,"Chen ZhirongLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 30 Sep 2018Exams might not be the best measure but they are by far the most accurate and reliable. I worry about whether its replacement will be fair to our students. And yes, there will be a replacement. What did you think would happen instead?0 comments1"

WizardAnswered on 30 Sep 2018Yes as an self assessment against established standards but not as comparison against each others for endless rat race. Which was what caused and created the kiasu mentality of Singapore and funded the billion dollars tuition industry. ​If only it focus more on learning and application not on assessment , others it simply kill the joy of learning and wipe of a potential great future generations of creative thinker and resilience generations. 0 comments1"

WonderkidAnswered on 01 Oct 2018our current education system, doesnt allow skill learning but theory memorising..our education system doesn’t teach the student how to think on the spot l, how to be creative.​ Some people are not the type that study day and night to memorise the 10year series of exams.. But they are intelligent in their.own way.0 comments0"
6,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 30 Sep 2018Yes to a certain extend as it shows how much you have learnt and understood about the content/concepts taught thus far. But on the other hand, it causes stress when students do not perform well or up to their parents standard. It also brings about competition which has both pros and cons. With that said, exams does not define one's intelligence. 0 comments0"
