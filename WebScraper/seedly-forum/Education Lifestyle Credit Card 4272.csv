1,"Elsa GohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 27 Oct 2018Hm if u are not working im not sure whether the banks etc will give u these cards, but here goes:Amex true cashback gives you cashback for virtually anything. New signups get 3% cashback up till 5k for first 6 mths. Therafter 1.5%. Amex also has a miles card but check properly first. But a lot of places dont accept amex.If your school fees are paid in a lump sum each time, can consider ocbc cash flo. It will auto split your lump sum payment across 3,6 or 12 mths and the bill every mth gives u 1% off. (Hard to explain but u can google it). But do check directly with them whether they give the 1% cashback on school fees. I think works for insurance as well. This is not amex so ur school more likely to accept.If the banks etc need u to have an income before they will issue u a card, and u dont have income, then ure left with the ones they have specially for graduates... that one a quick google will help you but i have a feeling very few allow cashback on school fees. Air miles im not so sure.Whatever card u get really make sure u can service the monthly bill if not ure just killing yourself.0 comments0"
