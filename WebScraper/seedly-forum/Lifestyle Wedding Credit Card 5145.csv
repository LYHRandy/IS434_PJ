1,"Isabella JoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 14 Aug 2018How about American Express True Cashback card? It has Welcome offer: Enjoy 3% cash back on up to total of S$5,000 spend for first 6 months.If you and wife both apply for individual card, it means up to S$10k spend with 3% cashback. Applying via singsaver also gives you S$150 cash rewards. (Disclaimer: We are in the process of applying and have yet to receive this cash rewards)

MasterAnswered on 11 Aug 2018For cashback, maybe u can check out SCB, look out for roadshows, they may be able to provide you with a lower annual income limit.​For miles, check out Citi Premier Miles, min 30k Salary, and the miles do not expire​And yes, you can swipe as many cards as you want. Do take advantage of the welcome promos for both credit cards so that you maximise the benefit.0 comments1"
