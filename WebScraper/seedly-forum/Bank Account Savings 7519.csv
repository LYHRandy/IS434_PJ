1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 05 Jun 2019I think it does sound pretty healthy - additionally the fact that you are conscious about how much you are saving etc probably means that you have targets to hit and probably exercise prudence in spending. You might want to consider investing as well, given that you are still young and can be less risk-averse.0 comments1"
