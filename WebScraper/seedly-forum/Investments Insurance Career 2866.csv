1,"Wilfred LingLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi,​If you want to provide unbias advice (in any industry), you need to be unbiased yourself.  Your question itself is already loaded with biasness because it is assumed that only a fee-based adviser can provide unbiased advice.  ​Whether is it fee-based or commission based, it is a form of renumeration system. The renumeration system does not make a person good or bad. A person is good because he has decided to do so. A person is bad because he has decided to do so. The ability to provide an unbiased advice is a personal choice, and not due to the renumeration system.  ​Nevertheless, if you charge a fee, your scope of advice will be expanded so that it becomes more holistic and comprehensive. A holistic and comprehensive advice is always better than narrowly focus.  ​Many financial advisers want to move to a fee-based renumeration system for the wrong reasons. The wrong reasons are: Want to provide unbiased advice . I always asked them why they can't provide unbiased advice in their present situation.  I often found out that the real reason is poor persuasion skill resulting in poor production (hence the pressure to sell more commission paying products to make up the low productivity). Thus, the problem is that of a poor persuasion skill. Moving to a fee-based system does not solve the fundamental problem.  In fact, it is made worst because you now need to persuade your prospect to pay you a fee. Does not want to do sales. This is also the wrong reason. A salesperson can be good or bad. It is a personal choice. Moreover, it is not true that the fee-based adviser is not selling anything. He is basically selling a financial plan to his customers. If the customers 'buy' his financial plan, they will achieve their financial goals. If the financial planner cannot persuade his customers to implement his financial plan, his customers' problems remains and the financial planner has failed in his duty.   There are basically two obstacles why the fee-based industry could not take off in Singapore:One reason is that the incumbents are refusing to change. In a fee-based system, the financial planner is renumerated by the client. He does not need to sell products to earn a living. Thus, the incumbents will lose the entire distribution channels and forcing them to sell direct. As direct selling will incur huge marketing cost with no guarantee of profits, they prefer to rely on commission based advisers who are only paid for each sale. In a commisison system, the incumbents' marketing cost is based on guaranteed results. Another reason is that there is very few advisers in Singapore who are doing fee-based. Without a critical mass, there is hardly anyone to guide newbies on how to go about doing it. Without a mentor, the newbie will be left in the dark to figure out how to do it. There are also some misconceptions with regard to fee-based advisory.One misconception is that FinTech will take over the human adviser. Actually FinTech has already revolutionised the way financial advisers conduct their advisory business and it started more than 10 years ago already. Contrary to popular belief, it actually increases advisers' productivity to do better.Another misconception that there are so much information on the finance in the Internet that nobody is going to pay for advice. Contrary to popular belief, the Internet has resulted in a huge demand for fee-based adviser. The Internet contain so much information that it also contain what is irrelevant and false information. But what people want isn't more information, what they want is wisdom to know what is relevant and how to apply it. This is the ideal market for fee-based adviser.The final misconception is that people are not willing to pay. This is not true. The more educated a person, the more likely he is willing to pay for good advice. By my experience, the sandwich generation is more than willing to pay. However, the high networth is unlikely to pay for advice because they are used to getting so called 'free' advice. But what they do not know is that they are often ripped off by expensive products (so life is quite fair, the rich get ripped off  and their money 'distributed' to others who need it. Haha, like robinhood).  I am not doing recruitment but if you wish to speak to me further, you can google my name on Internet to get hold of my contact. I can point you in the right direction. The most important is to join the right company. Your initial group of customers will be your own friends and relatives. If you switch company later, you would have abandon those who supported you. ​Wilfred LingA fee-based financial planner for 12 years​4 comments9"
2,"See all 4 comments Wilfred Ling13 Sep 2018I became a fee-based planner not by choice actually. During the initial 2 years I did not charge any fee. Unfortunately one of my competitor (a company) offered commission rebate to entice customers to buy products from them. I lost all my prospects to them and I didn't earn anything for 3 months. I was so fed-up / desperate that I started charging advisory fee. Strangely my business grew significantly after I started charging fee. Now all my referrals expect me to charge or else they will not trust me. So there was no turning back since.

3,"Christopher Tan, CEO at Providend LtdLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019As a matter of interest, globally, there are three compensation methods in providing financial adviceCommission-based : Advisers are paid 100% by commissionsFee-based: Advisers are paid by fees + commissionsFee-only: Advisers are paid 100% by feesIt does not mean that an adviser who is paid by commissions is any less independent, honest or competent. However, because commission is a source of conflict, removing commission from advice not only give clients more assurances that advice will be independent of the product commission, it also takes away the conflict from the adviser. In addition, because the client pays fee for advice, there is a greater expectation from the client that the advice given must be worth the fees paid. As such, a fee for service adviser will have to ensure that the quality of advice given will meet his/her client's demands. Over time, this builds the adviser's advisory competence.​Providend is Singapore's first fee-only advisory firm. All our advisers do not take commissions for advice. We have been operating as a fee-only adviser since day 1 of our operation in 2003. After 15 years of our experience, my conviction is that while it is the best way to give advice, it is not the only way. This is because, it might not be suited for clients who have simpler financial needs. They should not need to pay fees for simple advice. ​So depending on the type of clients you wish to serve, fee for service advice might be or might not be suitable. Hope this give some answers to your question.​You might also wish to read this article that I contributed to Sunday Times a few months ago and also various articles on our company website at www.providend.com​https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/know-financial-advisers-conversations-christopher-023800463.html​Have a blessed day!​​2 comments7"

5,"William Seah, Financial services consultant  at PiasLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 13 Sep 2018I think it's awesome that you want to provide unbiased financial advice.  It's something all advisors should strive toward. ​however, whether you are in a fee based or a financial advisory firm, biasness can still creep in. Its about the agent's belief and actions that will result in a bias or otherwise. If the agent in biased, no renumeration scheme will help. ​I'll also add that bias is not a bad thing; being pro btir means you are bias toward btir. what counts is whether you can justify why your bias results in a positive outcome for client. ​Extending the argument, its hard not to be biased. People are naturally biased; we are advisors not websites. We don't merely provide facts, we advise clients toward certain decisions. We help our clients by filtering out the noise, and choosing the solution that best fits. ​I do two things: 1. I do my best to determine my bias and why I am biased. I then consider the client's situation and decide whether my biasness helps. 2. I try to look around. Challenge your beliefs. Don't focus only justifying your position; spend time on trying a different solution and disproving your pre conceived notions. Often times , we find that it is in reading up on the opposite stand that we learn. It is when we cannot disprove our decision that we have a better foundation to stake our claim. . ​0 comments1"
6,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Sep 2018Yes, it is good. However, the competition in the financial advisory services is very stiff and the turnover rate is very high. However, as long as you are passionate in what you are doing, you will definitely tide over the difficult times.  Just my humble opinion. 0 comments0"
7,"Charmaine Ng, The Code Breaker at @ Every Chye Peng StallLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018I'll let the experts give their take but for me while commission based has more incentive to provide certain advices; same goes for fee-based. So long as you are earning from it; you're definitely biased in one way or another.​I think it's great that you're enjoying the learning (me too!) and would like to make it your career.. but you don't have to be in financial advisory to be advising people and to share the knowledge. You can take seedly as an example where people from different walks of life with their knowledges coming in to share together with peers..! ​I actually think it'd be more receptive for me this way; knowing that I have a question and the answers can be discussed by the community and sometimes even the pros might not have the most foolproof answer - and that's totally okay.​However if you do wish to make it as a career still, how about helping the community members here/starting a financial blog? Believe it would help your credentials really well and might actually help you to headstart the career you wanted! :)0 comments0"
8,"Dwivid SharmaLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 14 Sep 2018Definitely, it is a good choice for your career. But your path is not that simple and easy. There are lots of people who are providing same services. All you need to initiate with a free service provider. You need to help for free on several local forums and need to create your virtual value on the Internet.Then once you become valuable you can start making money with your advice.0 comments0"
9,"Kok KoonLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Family offices, fund management companies also work on % fee for AUMs. Market still used to getting advice from financial advisors for 'free' at this point although this is changing. ​Daniel (google him) from DIYinsurance, is fixed salary but the company that pays him is still paid by insurance companies. I like that he speaks with so much passion about his job.​There is a market for your service. Especially comprehensive ones that looks into not just protection, but asset allocation, investments, generational wealth planning, wills, trusts/foundations, business continuity base on family needs, age and risk profile. ​However, you really need to target a VERY SPECIFIC audience who knows, likes and trusts you to sustain a business. Become the valuable advisor people will pay to have you around.​The question then is - who do you want to serve? Do you enjoy being with your chosen clients or just because they look glam? ​Be so good in your chosen niche that they cannot ignore you. Differentiate yourself by educating your market and give practical, high value, usable advice.Let your free content be so good that your paid content or services or training will be so in demand people queue for it. ​We treat those who treat us well. The law of reciprocity. 1 comment0"

11,"Loh Tat Tian, Complex Manager at Ocean Ifm Pte LtdLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I'm having the same interest as you too. But I think if you really want to do such personal finance, it's better to think, what other value can you give besides unbaised opinion?A workshop? I am contemplating on setting up Insurance 101 for people to identify, breakdown Insurance policies, calculate ROI and have worksheets to go with such courses.2 comments0"

13,"Leong Wen FongLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Sep 2018Hahahaha I think it will be hard... When user can get this information for free here. ​Not impossible though! Having a mentor can lighten the burden of researching and trial and error when it comes to researching and investments. Perhaps what you can really consider is to join an investment-education institute like Dr Wealth to teach people and share your knowledge!​If you don't mind doing this for fun, then do answer the questions that people post here!0 comments0"
