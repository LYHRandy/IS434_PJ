1,"Dawn FionaLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 14 Aug 2018I would like to have two children ideally :)We saved up $30k for our current baby to cover prenatal costs, cord banking, baby essentials (just posted how we are saving costs by using Taobao), maternity insurance, delivery and hospital charges, and (touch wood!!) emergency C-section if the situation calls for it. Education is a huge topic for another day and will involve a mix of savings, home tutoring, values teaching and investing. I'll detail those answers in subsequent blog posts, do watch out for it! 0 comments2"
