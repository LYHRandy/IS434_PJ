1,"JianHao SooLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I found a very good loophole to become an AIA viatility member without buying expensive plan. Here's how it works: ‚Äã(1)  AIA Direct 5 year Term Plan $50k sum assured, no rider, non-smoker, no CI for 25 year old male only cost $46.05 a year, which is $3.83 per month. ‚Äã(2) AIA Vitality cost $5 a month. ‚ÄãEach week, if you meet the inidivual weekly target, you will get $5 voucher - Cold storage/Starbucks. Assuming if you meet the target every week, you will get $20, less $8.38, you will earn $11.62. ‚ÄãNote that you have to sign up the plan with AIA Customer service directly as there is $0 distribution cost (meaning agent don't earn anything). 2 comments9"
2,Zul Idham11 Nov 2018I've just  checked the aia website. Limited policies attached to aia vitality. Personal accident no longer has aia vitltyBrandon Lee4w agoIt works! Downside is you have to go down to the customer service counter to purchase it (Raffles or Tampines). Thank you Jianhao!
3,"Cherie Julianne TanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Oh dear, I was about to say Personal Accident Plan cheapest plan without all the options available. That would be about $17/month..‚ÄãHm..maybe your company's insurance? Hopefully they are under AIA.‚ÄãIf not, another option would be AIA Glow of Life! Its a female critical illness coverage, it is about $18 - 22/month and it comes with free health checkup every 2 years!4 comments10"

You can check it out here. https://www.aiavitality.com.sg/memberportal/how_to_join"
5,"Lee Shan ShanLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019You might actually want to look into the benefits of the aia solitaire pa plan vs the prudential pa plan. For example, the pricing of the plans are very similar for the basic plan but for aia you can actually add in an additional riders to get a weekly indemnity benefit of 100 per week. This will be useful when you are injured accidentally and is given a period of Mc to rest. ‚ÄãIn addition, the benefits and discounts of the AIA Vitality would far outweigh the costs of the premiums involved. ‚ÄãLet me me know if you need further clarifications. 1 comment7"
6,Charmaine Ng17 Aug 2018I noticed that I am paying $14.88/mth for the personal accident plan so if the costs isn't too big of a variance yes; I think I might switch over! Ultimately coverage is most important and the indemnity of $100/week could prove useful. Thank you so much!
7,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Aug 2018For AIA, I am currently on their hospitalisation plans.‚ÄãSince personal accident plans are renewable yearly, guess u can consider switching to AIA after your current term finishes? The vouchers from the Vitality Programme is more than the premiums of the PA plan itself. But that is also provided that you spend about S$40 per month on either Cold Storage or Starbucks (=0 comments5"
8,"Vinc TayLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 01 May 2019You can get AIA PA, then drop your Pru PA. (Or hold both if you like lol.) Remember to have the new one in-effect before you cancel the other one, so you do not go without coverage. Personal Accident policies do not require underwriting, hence you can buy like you are subscribing to Spotify.While reimbursements you will have to choose either to claim, the sum assured actually adds up in event of death etc.0 comments3"
9,"Jim NgLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 12 Nov 2018Provided that you do not have an existing medical condition:You can switch from the Prudential Shield Plan to the AIA Shield Plan, which is largely competitive in terms of the price in the market as well: If you are already paying for the Prudential Hospitalisation Plan's cash rider, take note of this: With the AIA Max Essential A Saver Rider ( Reduces the cash rider costing), you enjoy saving more on the cash rider portion!Compare between Prudential and AIA here:https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/sites/default/files/image/2017/07/24/onlineupdated_0.jpg0 comments3"

11,"Charmaine Ng12 Nov 2018Hahaha yeah, this question was asked some time back. I've got my AIA triple cover plan. Thank you so much.. for those who are interested to find out the eligible policies; please find it here: https://www.aia.com.sg/en/our-products/aia-vitality.html"
12,"GTGabriel Tan Jun WeiLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Your best bet would be AIA Solitare PA or AIA Glow of Life to justify your premiums with the benefits‚ÄãHowever if you still have a gap in your coverage, why not consider other plans AIA has to offer? ‚Äã‚Äã2 comments3"
13,"Charmaine Ng17 Aug 2018I agree! Am looking at other insurances and plans. One thing I'm lacking is term insurance so I'm actually looking at AIA triple critical coverage plan. GTGabriel Tan Jun Wei17 Aug 2018If you need a quote üòÅ, you can email me at gabrielgrantt@aia.com.sg "
14,"Derek KooLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019If you are willing, you could perhaps switch one of your plans over to AIA. That way you are not purchasing an additional policy for the sake of it.‚ÄãIf for example the AIA PA aia more expensive than your prudential, the benefits from the vitality program should more than make up for the difference. 1 comment3"
15,Charmaine Ng17 Aug 2018That's a great idea! I'm exploring all options before weighing the costs to the pros and cons to make a decision. Thank you!
16,"Paul Sherwin AngLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 04 May 2019I am currently with the AIA Solitaire personal accident plan just solely for AIA Vitality, and that plan is actually pretty good for people who play sports regularly, as it covers physical injuries from sports, from ambulance to outpatient procedures. It even covers food poisoning incidents, and TCM sessions relating to injuries! I was so amazed by it that I upped the plan under my own discretion.0 comments2"
