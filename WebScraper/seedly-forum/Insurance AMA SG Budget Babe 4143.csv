GeniusAnswered on 14 Aug 2018Unfortunately that's how insurance works :( which is why buying early when one is healthy is SO important, but very few people think about insurance when they're healthy, sadly!​Alternatives would be government-led insurance such as MediShield Life. However, it is mostly insufficient if CI hits again.​Another option is that of moratorium underwriting, where you do not need to make health declaration but instead survive a waiting period imposed by the insurer. If no treatments, medication or symptoms of your pre-existing condition appears during this time, then your application may be approved. Unfortunately, this practice is not common in Singapore among most insurers.​Another resort would be that of international health insurers, some of whom provide coverage for pre-existing illnesses BUT they're often very very expensive! ​Therefore I think the best alternative would be to self-insure i.e. save up and/or grow your money to cover your own costs.0 comments2"

GeniusAnswered on 19 Aug 2018Moratorium underwriting will not work as cancer is a permanent exclusion. ​Are you asking regarding medical/hospitalisation plans or plans that will give lump sum payout inevent of critical illness?​There are no individual medical plans in the market that will not exclude your condition if you are even accepted. You have to look for group policy that will accept participants that will cover pre-exisitng conditions. Ping me if you would like to learn more.​0 comments0
