1,"JJeremyTop Contributor (Sep)Level 5. GeniusUpdated on 20 Sep 2019Yes, I do have the BG50 Referral programme Code for US$50 worth of MCO tokens when you use my referral link: https://platinum.crypto.com/r/5yz2mybv64, or enter Referral Code: 5yz2mybv64.To unlock the sign-up bonus, you'll need to stake at least 50 MCO (in other words, apply for the Ruby Steel Visa Card).P.S. 50 MCO stake is equivalent to about SG$240 at today's rate. And this would allow you to get the Ruby Steel Metal Visa card that you can use to get 100% rebate on your Spotify subscription and 2% cashback on all transactions. Well, you can, of course, choose to stake more, 500 MCO (~$2400) for the higher tier card to get 100% rebates on both Spotify and Netflix and even airport lounge access.More details on the BG50 referral programme here: https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/3124990-bg50-referral-program0 comments3"
