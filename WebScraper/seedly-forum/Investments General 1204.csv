WizardAnswered on 22 May 2019I'm in a similar situation as you, so what I have done is to:Put aside an emergency fundApportion a segment to equities Bought a freehold property (that was sometime back) for rental yield Put the rest in interest generating savings accounts With regards to whether short term savings plans are 'good' or not, it really depends on your risk profile and need for liquidity.0 comments1"

God of WisdomAnswered on 22 May 2019If you're investing for retirement while trying to build financial independence, I'd convert half of that into a dividend paying portfolio and the other half into a capital accumulating portfolio.One to pay you every month so you can start living for free, and the other for you to exponentially grow and help you truly stop work one day and live a very comfortable retirement lifestyle.In both cases, there's a rule of thumb for asset allocation. You have a long investment horizon and should be able to take risk. Divide the number of years to retirement by 3 and 4 and you would have the expected rate of return your portfolio should be expected to generate. Eg. 30 years to retirement, your portfolio should be giving you 7.5-10% return p.a.To achieve this you can also follow the following rule:Your age should be the % allocated into bonds and fixed income in your portfolio. Rebalanced quarterly and adjusted every 5 years.If you're 30, you should have a 70% equity portfolio and a 30% bond portfolio.When you're 50, it's 50% equity and 50% bond. And with 15 years to retirement, your portfolio should be giving you 3.75-5% return.Invest globally, stay invested, and ignore the headlines. You can set up a portfolio using funds with a IFA like myself or through the various digital investment managers/ robo advisors. If you know you're able to take risk but still can't allow yourself to, speak to a human advisor and let us do some investment and emotional coaching to help you be more assured in your invested monies.0 comments0"

Many would aspire to be in your position in early 30s!There are so many ways to construct an investment portfolio that is it so hard to answer this. But the fundamentals of an investment portfolio comes down to, what is your risk appetite.Low risk = higher allocation in low risk investments (High yield savings account, SSBs, defensive REITs)High Risk = higher allocation in high risk investments (REITs, growth stocks, alternative investments)Im not a financial advisor so I can only share what i wish would be in my portfolio if i have S$250,000 in savings.Risk appetite: Moderate to high riskCash in high yield bank account: S$50,000 . I'd allocate these into DBS multiplier for a 2-3% annual interest rate. This forms my daily expenses, emergency fund, serves as liquid cash.REITS: S$100,000. I'd aim to get some good quality REITs which gives me 5-6% of annual dividends, of which I'll reinvest to get more REITs. US Growth Stocks: S$100,000. I'd aim to get 6-8% of annual capital gain from this, of which I'll reinvest into my REITs portfolio to get more recurring dividends.Of course, if I were to do these, I would have made sure that I have S$50,000 - S$80,000 in my CPFSA as a safety net / buffer for my high risk appetite. Disclaimer: This is an illustrated portfolio, and I'm not a financial advisor. :)Private property is great but with S$250,000 - it's pushing it a little, even more so if its a single owner occupancy. A 3BR condo can be between 500k - 1M or more, and the downpayment, renovation, monthly upkeep and mortgage can be stressful.Are short term saving plans eg. lock up capital for 3-5 years with 2-3% returns good? Hmm i honestly dont think its good. There are many other instruments that gives u 2-3% without the capital lock up (high yield savings account, some defensive REITs).Hope this helps!0 comments0"

DefendAttackDefendEnsuring that liabilities are covered using insurance instruments. Life/Term/ Critical illness and hospital insurance coverage etcAttack Therer are many areas that you can start off with. You can just start somewhere and build your portfolio slowly. Some areas that you can look into include REITS, ROBO, Stocks, Bonds, Funds, Retirement plans. Of course, if you do not want to spend too much time reading up, invest in building a long term relationship with a professional financial advisor and let the expert walk you through.0 comments0"
