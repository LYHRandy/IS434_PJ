God of WisdomUpdated 2w agoHi anon,The Live Fresh student card comes with no fees for 5 years, so no worries about forgetting to pay the fee. A credit card basically works on 'credit', meaning the bank 'credits' you money when you spend first, and then you have to pay them back when the bill is due (it's a monthly cycle). One of the benefits is 0.3% cashback (uncapped), along with other promotional tie-ups with other brands. For example, if you buy GV movie tickets with cash from Monday to Wednesday, you might pay $10. Pay with the card, and you get a dollar off. Yes, it's that simple. So check out the list of deals/merchants that the card has in order to maximize it.Just remember to pay the bill. You have to pay at least 3% of the monthly statement balance (or S$50, whichever is greater) but you should pay in full. The problem comes when you don't. That's when interest piles up and compounds and debt becomes unmanageable. Don't get a credit card if you are not sure that you can pay off the bills in full. I cannot stress this enough. I assume you are working part-time? Your salary minus off expenses leads to decent cash flow, and the credit limit of the card is $500, so you will likely not overspend since your credit limit is capped.Yes, DBS credit card spend will count towards a higher interest in the Multiplier account. You'll have to do the maths to see if it's worth.0 comments6"
2,"Justin Kieran OngLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered 2w agoHi, just would like to add that the student card is really for students only. So if you're not currently enrolled into a poly/uni, you most likely will not get the card.If you have just graduated, you might still be able to get it but no guarantees.Once you have the card, you can keep it till it expires even if you're no longer a student. But most people will change as the cash back is only 0.3% on all spend.0 comments0"
3,"Huang Yixuan, Product Designer at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterAnswered 2w agoHey! Understand all these can be confusing to you, I'd start off with a brief intro to how credit cards work:
Let's say you have $1000 in your bank.
You use your credit card to pay for this month's phone bill, food and transport ($225).What it means is that your bank will still have $1000 for the whole of October, and you only need to pay that $225 next month as a whole to DBS.Let's say in Sept you cannot afford to pay DBS that $225 you owe, that's where you would incur the monthly repayment of 3%, where you have to pay them interest. If you pay DBS on time every month, then you don't have to worry about this at all.So what are the benefits of getting a credit card then?Monthly cashback The higher interest rate in Multiplier account.For monthly cashback, you get 5% cashback on everything you spend on Paywave and online (capped at $20 each respectively). This means to maximise your cashback, you should aim to pay for your food with Paywave and pay your phone bills online. Otherwise, this segment could be quite redundant for you given your spending habits.0 comments0"
