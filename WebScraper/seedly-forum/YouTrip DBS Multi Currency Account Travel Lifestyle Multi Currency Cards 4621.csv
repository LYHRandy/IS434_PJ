1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 24 Jun 2019Personally, I prefer Youtrip for the competitive rates.I just used Youtrip on my Japan trip, and found rates to be comparable to what I could get from the Raffles Place money changers.Another big plus - when I was out of JPY for a transaction, it converted my SGD to JPY. Which also means, no small change that I need to change back to SGD when I get back! For me, that's a nice plus since I typically don't like to change it back to local currency.I don't mind using it as a one-way wallet, because I use Youtrip as an EZ-Link card as well for my local commute!Get S$15 free money after your first top up on Youtrip with this link!https://youtrip.app.link/HUI%20JUN128899 * Update June 2019: GET AN ADDITIONAL $5 with the code JUNUS - which brings you to a total of $15 instead of the usual $10 from other referral codes!so a total of $15!0 comments1"

Youtrip is a one-way wallet. You can only empty it by 1) using it fully at a merchant, 2) keep the account active, upon expiry, but subject to their approval.0 comments1"
