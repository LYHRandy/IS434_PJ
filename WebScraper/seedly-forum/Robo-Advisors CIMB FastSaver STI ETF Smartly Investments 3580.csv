1,"Goh Kah KiatLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 07 Jun 2018You have a great start compared to your peers. I think you just need to increase your income source from future full time work and you should be fine. Given your interest in index investing, I'll refrain from recommending active stock investing to increase your returns.0 comments0"
