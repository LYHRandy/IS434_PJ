question,"Lifestyle Education Asked by AnonymousAsked on 26 Dec 2018My children have all grown up, and I don't have any financial needs. I have always been interested in digital marketing, but have been an engineer all my life. Should I take up an internship?More context: I have enough savings and CPF that I don't need to worry about retirement. I took a few courses on marketing just for the fun of it, but want to look for a job for it in real life- more to occupy myself. Do companies allow older people to work as interns?7 answersAnswerBump0"

Try:Go for DM related networking events. Join and find some groups or restaurant or nearby nearboughood cafe and offer your pro bono service to help them do DM and manage their Social Media accounts and increase business. You can show them your qualitifications and passion.  If they are skeptical, you can negotiate to try help them out for like 3 to 6 months, and since you're providing pro-bono  free services, I don't see why they wouldn't take it up or even work together with you manage it together!
If I have a business, I would definite get your help to work this out together! :)
Cheers!

I think it would resonate well with you at this stage in your life :)Synopsis:  Seventy-year-old widower Ben Whittaker has discovered that retirement isn't all it's cracked up to be.

ProdigyAnswered on 26 Dec 2018No harm trying, while it seems challenging for the older people to get job in new field, there are a couple of the govt scheme that encourage companies to hire the older folks. And if your desired internship pay is affordable to the company, they might be open to offer an internship!0 comments0"
