1,"CPF BoardLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Jun 2019Hi,
The rules were updated to take into account the changing needs and higher life expectancy of Singaporeans. With 1 in 3 Singaporeans aged 65 today expecting to live beyond 90, the rules were changed to focus on whether the remaining lease of the property can last the youngest buyer until at least the age of 95. This will give Singaporeans more flexibility to buy a home for life, while safeguarding their retirement adequacy.
Hence, CPF members turning 55 who do not own a property that lasts them to at least 95 years old can only withdraw above their Full Retirement Sum (FRS). This also ensures that if a member outlives his/her property, he/she can still tap on savings above his/her Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) to purchase a home that can last him/her to at least 95 years old.
Thank you.0 comments6"
