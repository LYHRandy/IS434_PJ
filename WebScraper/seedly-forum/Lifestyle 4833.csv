question,"Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked on 22 May 2019Huawei-Trade War incident: what's the moral thing to do? ?Yall probably care more about the resale value of your phones and the share price of your stocks if you have China stocks. But what I'm wondering is, there is something more important than just money. This seems to be a net neutrality issue, and also about how the world is allowing a demagogue to anyhow ban stuff. Why shouldnt we boycott American industries/Google instead? Am I missing something important, because what Trump is doing doesnt seem right.1 answerAnswerBump0"

1,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I wouldnt say if it is right or wrong. Trump is just acting in the interest (from his point of view), whether USA will ultimately benefit(net benefit) is another story. It will be more of a matter will it be effective at all.China had long ban the use of Google (youtube, gmail, googlemaps etc), facebook, whatsapp, netflix and many other websites and services in their country. So China is right to block foreign businesses to protect their own industries? Among many issues, it is no secret China businesses had stolen/copied technologies/IP from western business, and China is doing little about them. In part maybe of course it is beneficial to China itself in the 'technology transfer'. etc etcWe all just happen to be caught up in collateral damage.2 comments0"
2,"Question Poster22 May 2019Seems like both are equally at fault then. If I were to act according to what I think I right or wrong I will have to boycott both Chinese and American industries for fighting this stupid war. Unfortunately these two players make up almost the entire global economy and most tech emerges from them.Yixiong Chang22 May 2019Yes, in the end it is the common people that suffer."
