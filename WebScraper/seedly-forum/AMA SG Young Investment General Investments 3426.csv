ProdigyAnswered on 11 Sep 2018You can read some books which I recommend to get started: https://sgyounginvestment.blogspot.com/p/books-i-recommend.html​Also, some posts which I have curated for readers who want to get started: http://sgyounginvestment.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html​Yes you'll need to open a brokerage and CDP account. For more info, you can refer here: http://sgyounginvestment.blogspot.com/2013/06/hot-do-i-start-investing.html​Whether a company is worth investing takes experience and skills. First, you'll need to learn how to read financial statements. I have a 2 part series on how to pick stocks:​http://sgyounginvestment.blogspot.com/2013/08/how-to-pick-stocks-part-1-economic-moats.htmlhttp://sgyounginvestment.blogspot.com/2013/08/how-to-pick-stocks-part-2-profitability.html​Lastly, to gain financial freedom, its about creating passive income that surpasses your expenses. Learn to create passive income through investing or other ways. It takes time and effort but you will get there one day if you start somewhere now. Make it as a goal will be good. 0 comments0"
