question,Robo-Advisors Investments Stashaway Asked by John DoeAsked on 19 May 2019I am quite pleased with Stashaway's mobile app and returns in the last 6 months (about 9% capital growth). However - their annual fee of 0.8% + 0.1% FOREX fees is high. Are there advisors who are cheaper in the long run if I were to do monthly SIP?3 answersAnswerBump2

1,John DoeLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 19 May 2019Here is my analysis:ETF investment:Stashaway: 0.8% (p.a) + 0.1% (forex) + ETF fund mgmt. fees (0.2%)Autowealth: 0.5%(p.a) + 18$ paltform fee + ETF fund mgmt. fees (0.2%) + 0.1% (forex)unit trusts:Moneyowl: 0.65% (p.a) + 0.18% platform fee + fund Mgmt fees. (0.4%)Endowus: 0.6% (p.a) + fund mgmt fees (0.4% - 0.5%)Clearly the trend is between 1-1.2% p.a choosing either ETF or unit trusts. ETF's also have 30% tax on dividend which unit trusts don't. Cheapest seams to be Endowus under unit trusts and auto wealth for ETF's Many thanks0 comments1

3,"Amanda Ong, Head Of Client Engagement & Pr at StashawayLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi John,Just jumping in to clarify some of points above. Our pricing structure ranges from 0.2-0.8% i.e the more you invest with us or as your AUM grows, the lower it gets.The 0.1% currency conversion fee is charged by our broker and is actually much lower than what you would get if you converted with your bank. If you'd like to save on your fees, you can also consider our referral programme here :)2 comments0"
4,"John Doe23 May 2019Thanks Amanda.  Have already referred 2 people and they signed up on StashAway.  But I didn’t get referral promos as they forgot to use my code when signing in.  Both of them are senior colleagues and it’s embarrassing for me to reveal or ask them more info on this. Unfortunately Stashaway Support couldn’t help without the above - not a problem of your support but I feel a bit pinchedAmanda Ong23 May 2019Hi John, can you send us an email at support@stashaway.com (addressing it to me) with your StashAway registered email so I can check this out for you."
