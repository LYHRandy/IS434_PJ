1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I would recommend Canary! in Orchard Delphi center. You can check it out. Really helpful and not too pushy salespeople.I bought mine there after walking around alot in Orchard road lol. I rather feel and look at the ring offline (because there were some people who recommended online) but I feel less safe haha1 comment1"
2,"Loh Tat Tian20 Dec 2018For my wedding bands (I didn't get any engagement ring), i bought it at Venus Tears. They do have some nice range of engagement ring too. (Why i went Venus Tears is because they are the only few ones who have platinum ring bands. Titanium Ring bands are heavy...)."
