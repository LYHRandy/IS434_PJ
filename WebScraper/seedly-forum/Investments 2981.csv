1,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 03 Dec 2018How about allocate some funds for retirement planning by topping up your CPF special account.You will earned a guaranteed rate of 4%. For the first $60k in your CPF combined balance (with only up to $20k max from OA), the monies will earn an extra 1%. Since you are still young, u will not be near the limit yet. Thus it is worthwhile to topup to earn effective 5% return. Risk-free, regardless of market conditions.In additional u will receive tax relief for the topped up amount. Eg, your taxable income is $40k, for every dollar u earn above 40k is taxed at 7%. Therefore, if u topped up $1000 into your special account, u get $1000 tax relief, u saved 7% of $1000 = $70 tax money. Effectively have gotten 7% return on your money, in additional u will earn 4%-5% interest yearly guaranteed.0 comments1"

God of WisdomAnswered on 03 Dec 2018If you're looking for income streams, you can get them from: Bond Coupons/Funds (3-4%), Annuities (4-6%), Rental Payouts from REITs or Property (4-6%), Dividends from Stocks (6%).I've also listed them from lowest risk to higher risk.Honestly, Seedly's articles and other local investor's blogs cover them to a quite in depth extent.0 comments0"
