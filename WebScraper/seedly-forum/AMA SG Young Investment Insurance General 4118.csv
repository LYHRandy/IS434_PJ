question,"AMA SG Young Investment Insurance General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 11 Sep 2018I have a loose shoulder joint that is causing me some discomfort and pain. Can i claim my insurance for this to see a specialist?I had a bad fall about a year ago, and after that have been hearing a snaping sound on my left shoulder blade. It’s really in discomfort and i saw a regular GP once who said that it was just a strain. But it won’t go away. How do i go to a specialist for this? And which insurance can I claim? I have a personal accident plan by FWD and the private H&S by NTUC income. My agent has left the industry sadly.1 answerAnswerBump1"

For private H&S, its only for hospitalisation unless you had stayed inpatient for the loose shoulder problem before and still can claim for outpatient treatment (within 3 months after discharge for NTUC). You'll have to check with a financial advisor on the details of your plan. For your FWD, you can definitely contact them directly and they will be able to advise you. 0 comments1"
