1,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Feb 2019Hello!You should look for growth in earning, which comes from higher revenues in terms of higher occupancy rates and increasing rents, lower costs and new business opportunities. It is also important that you research the management team that oversees the REITs properties. A good management team will have the ability to upgrade the facilities and enhanceÂ the services of an under-utilised building, increasing demand.Hope this helps !0 comments0"
2,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 28 Feb 2019Based on what i have read, i think that there are a few factors that you should look out for.First, earnings that are growing or have growth potential should be one of the key factors that should be considered. This can be driven both by occupancy rates and rental charge. Look also at the costs associated with the real estate.Second, look at the management of the real estate, their track record, growth plans and experienceThird, i think it would be important to look at industry trends such as growing or worsening demand for different kinds of real estate. Different forms of real estate may be going up or down and i think that it would be quite helpful to be forward looking on this.Fourth, when looking at the REIT portfolio, you would also need to see how diversified the REIT is itself, such as geographical differences and sectorsFifth, look at the weighed average lease expiry which is the average number of years left before the current lease expires. When the wale is longer, the retail income is more predictable, and less prone to disruption. The risk associated with such investments would be lower.Sixth, look at the gearing ratio, which shows how much debt has been incurred relative to equity. A lower percentage of gearing could mean less interest expense being incurred and with more space for being able to take on more debt in the future to fund growth or operations (there is cap on how geared you can be in SG).0 comments0"
