1,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 11 Sep 2018There are robo advisors that invest in US ETFs such as Stashaway or smartly. However, with them you are not able to DIY your choice of ETFs.​For DIY, you have to open a broker account with access to US markets, sign the W8BEN form and you are good to go.​​0 comments0"
