question,"DBS Altitude Visa Signature Card AMEX Singapore KrisFlyer Card Credit Card Transportation travel Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked on 02 Aug 2019Is the DBS Altitude Visa or Amex Krisflyer Blue better based on my spending behaviour?Hi, I expect that I can spend $5000 in the next 3 months: $2500 on flights, $1500 on accommodation, $1000+ on a new phone. Which of the 2 cards is better for me?A little torn as I'm a GrabPay user for Grab rides and offline merchant payments (~$300/month). Amex has 3.1miles for GrabPay & 7500 bonus if I hit $5000 spend. But DBS Altitude has better rates of 1.2 miles local spend, 3 miles for flight bookings, & 5000 bonus with $6000 spend.Which would you recommend me for maximum benefits?1 answerAnswerBump0"

1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 03 Aug 2019Why not both? LOLBut to be serious and honest, get the DBS Altitude Card for better sign up bonus. Furthermore, you get more miles (3mpd) paying for air tickets and hotels (airbnb included) so it is better than Krisflyer AMEX. Furthermore, DBS points earned don't expire so you are not in a rush. AMEX Krisflyer points are valid for 3 years once they are transferred over to your Krisflyer account so there is a sense of urgency there.Typically, AMEX cards are good for sign up bonus. Once you see a very good sign up bonus (their current one is meh~), apply, get the bonus and throw it one side. I only keep mine because it gives me 3.1 for Grab rides. Otherwise, my spendings are directed towards other cards.2 comments0"
2,"Question Poster02 Aug 2019Thanks for this! Super helpful. Yeah main consideration against getting both is that my S$5000 spend that I forecast in the next 3 months can only be expensed to one card haha. So it's one or the other for me (for now) :P

What's a gauge for good sign up bonus for AMEX? I'm new to this, so don't have any past experiences to benchmark against.Aik Kai03 Aug 2019Woah. hard to put it simply. But if it helps, use the total bonus miles divided by the spend required. The answer should not exceed 2 cents per mile."
