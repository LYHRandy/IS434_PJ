WizardAnswered on 03 Dec 2018Here are my quick thoughts, because I actually tried it out:Really affordable for that level of coverage in terms of $50k, 100k and 200kGood add on for folks who do not qualify for SAF level MINDEF MHA term insurance and riders (eg ladies or people who did not serve army)Can buy seperately on it's own, so that's actually a good thing (you don't have to buy an existing policy and use as a rider)Quick and easy DIY, explained in simpler english on their website0 comments0"
