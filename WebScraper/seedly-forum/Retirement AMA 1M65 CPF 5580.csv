question,"Retirement AMA 1M65 CPF Asked by Neil BowyerAsked on 07 Nov 2018How do I grow my CPF as fast as possible?I am a late starter, became PR 2 years ago at age 45. I pay max contributions through my salary, transfer from OA to SA every month, and make a voluntary contribution to SA of $7k each year, which I think is my max.

1,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 07 Nov 2018You can top up more to your special account, just that tax relief is granted only up to $7k per year. The topup limit is up to the Full retirement sum. If the 4% interest rate makes sense for u, u can topup more. Since, you are a high income earner, it makes sense to take advantage of the tax relief every year. But probably we can do a simple spreadsheet to calculate how to max out your retirement account over the next 10-20years. Since you are getting max CPF contribution from your salary, I can easily assume you are a high income earner at least $80k annual. That makes u in the 11.5% tax bracket. Or if u are $120k, will be in the 15% tax bracket. You might also want to consider the SRS (supplementary retirement scheme). The current contribution limit is $15,300 per year, (dollar for dollar tax relief as well). But u have to dictate your own investment for that money instead. Do add me on my facebook if you would want more detailed discussion. It will not be convenient to discuss here extensively. 0 comments1"
