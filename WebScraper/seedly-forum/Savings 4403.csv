God of WisdomAnswered 3w agoHi Cassandra,If I was following Seedly's 50-30-20 rule, I would probably classify it under the '50' category, seeing as how travel trip monies can't be classified under the wealth or savings category.I personally use a 40-30-20-10 rule to budget my expenses (and I recommend it to my clients as well), but basically the '40' category would be used to settle day to day expenses. '30' is for loans (eventually when you get a property, you'll have to take a mortgage) but if '30' is not being utilized (when you don't have a house yet), then one can direct it to '20' which is for savings and investment. In this instance, savings for a holiday would still be under my '40' category.Perhaps Kenneth can shed light on this since he wrote the article. Kenneth, over to you.1 comment7"

3,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusUpdated 3w agoUpticked the question coz there's so many different ways to look at it. From what I have read, plus the different variations:Seedly - 50% expenses / 30% wealth retirement / 20% savings or emergencyElizabeth Warren who's running for elections:
50% needs / 30% wants / 20% savingsGail Vaz Oxlade (Canada): 35% housing / 15% transportation / 25% life / 15% debt / 10% savings.Big items actually come in several categories (eg downpayments, medical emergencies, retirement, wedding)... Personally I feel three category is too tight (you end up with very broad buckets), but if I had to recommend, I would use a six bucket framework like this:A) Allowance for self, and family (some call 家用): 15% +/- 5% B) Housing / Rent: 30% +/- 5%
If you have yet to pay your own mortgage, consider splitting between saving for downpayment and household utilities.C) Recurring expenses and/ or annual ones like insurance, transportation, tax, wifi / cable, s&cc, dental... : 15% +/- 5%D) Entertainment and Wants: 10% +/- 5%
Travel would be here, as well as clubbing/movies, shopping...E) Emergencies: 5% (keep in bank and/or SSBs)
Theoretically, we all advocate 3 - 6 mths, which is a topic in itself. It's a nice place to be but even for myself, I want 12 mths for certain types of expenses. But if u carry consumer debts, then hoarding a lot of emergency funds in low yield safe places is not a very smart thing to do.F) Lumping up retirement / savings / non-housing debts / other future goals here. Would suggest 15-25% here, but it goes in an orderpay off debts if you have anyno debt, look at future goals (wedding/children)split out some for retirement, helps to start early, but up to your comfort level in things like annuities, SRS and RSTU.put the remaining in investments that you have some sort of flexibility in case you really really need to sell them to meet some needs.They would need to be balanced to 100% total. And it's not dead... For budgets, you will slowly get the hang of it and adjust as necessary based on your priorities.Personally, over my entire career, my total savings per year (for category E and F) tend to average about 3 to 4 mth salary, so about 1/3 goes to retirement, I adjust my emergency funds between cash and SSBs, and the rest in dividend-paying assets to have passive income in case shit happens.2 comments2"
