WizardAnswered on 24 Oct 2018These are the short selling regulations in HKhttps://www.hkex.com.hk/Services/Trading/Securities/Overview/Regulated-Short-Selling?sc_lang=enI suggest if you want to short any stocks in any market, better to use CFD. Short sell a physical stock without owning it can be disastrous if you are not able to obtain the shares.0 comments0"
