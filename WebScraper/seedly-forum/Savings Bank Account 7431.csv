3,"SWShaun Wq LimLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I am assuming that you are asking because you like simplicity.One simple option could CIMBâ€™s FastSaver account. 
Min. $1,000 for 1% up to max. $50,000.Another simple option is CIMBâ€™s StarSaver account.
Min. $1,000 for 0.8% with no cap, I believe.Consider also Singapore Savings Bonds.
If you donâ€™t need the money on tap, as redemption of SSBs is credited back to your bank account the following month.
Min $500 for variable % up to total $200,000. 
$2 transaction fee applies.If you have a large sum, Citibankâ€™s MaxiGain is another option. 
Min. $70,000 for up to 2.2%(depending on the SIBOR rate) on up to max. $150,000.Have not included others such as Standard Chartered Bankâ€™s eSaver account or UOB Stash account, as they have tiered interest rates for balances. Which I find not simple ðŸ¤“. They do mention the effective interest rate(EIR) in their small print though. Do check them out if you are interested or already have a banking relationship and want to keep it within the same bank.1 comment1"
