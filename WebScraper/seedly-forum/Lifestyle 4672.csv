1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 30 Aug 2019What is the price of the EC or private condo that you are looking at? Even if it's $500k (quite rare), just the 20% downpayment alone will fully wipe out the $100k of cash and CPF that you have.
Don't forget other liabilities and the cash buffer/emergency fund you will need.
I agree with Gabriel, in that 'there is no other way around', especially if you said without taking on too many jobs or debts. Unless a windfall comes.0 comments2"
2,"Charlot NgLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 30 Aug 2019Current Piermont grand going at 1100 psf and riverfront residence also about 1200psf. If you go for the smallest unit about 450 sqft, you are looking at close to 500k price tag (psf will be higher than what I listed for smaller units). Since you can only loan 75%, means you'll need cash/cpf upfront of at least 125k, which you are 25k short. After including tax and fees, maybe 50k short. Maybe can borrow for family, but what's the point of overstretching yourself to buy a mickey mouse unit in the heartland? ROI also not good. So do think over carefully0 comments0"

Perhaps you need to consider that EC or condo might be out of your budget?0 comments0"
