From a fundamental perspective, $SNAP has rebounded since beating analyst estimations in its previous earnings report. Although the company is still losing active users, it does not appear as bad as street forecasts. Even though many people are believers in the bear case for SNAP, SNAP is not going down without a fight from management!0 comments0"
