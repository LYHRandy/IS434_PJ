RookieAnswered on 08 Mar 2019First...you will have to understand:How long do you want to stay invested?When do you see yourself liquidating/surrendering/cashing out your investment?Endowments and ILPs might be other avenues for you to consider other than Regular Saving Plans from banks.Actions leads to reactions/consequences. Choices arise from the knowledge you have and thus, making the best decision with its consequences something you can bear.0 comments0"

If you wanna accumulate the money and buy intermittently, and have more time to do research and monitor prices, then you could buy 1 - 2 stock positions every year. 
Other instruments like fixed deposits, short term endowments, (good quality) corporate bonds are also worth considering when the opportunities come up. 0 comments0"
