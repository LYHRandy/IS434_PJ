1,"Zen Rogue XuanLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 10 Jun 2019CPF Life provides you with monthly payouts for as long as you live. The amount you put in will determine how much you will be getting. If you do not hit the CPF Full Retirement Sum(FRS), you will be eligible to withdraw 5k, while the rest will be given in the form of monthly payout.0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 06 Jun 2019Yes as long as you have more than 20k in your OA + SA Accounts. CPF Life will pay a pro rated amount, so if you set aside 65% of the FRS, you'll get about 65% of the payouts. You can use the CPF Life estimator calculator on the CPF website to have a look. Play around with the numbers. :)0 comments0"
