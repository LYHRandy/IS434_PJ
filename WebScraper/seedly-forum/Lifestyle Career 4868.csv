1,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 Dec 2018I think we have to look into two aspect of the issue first.1) It appears that the family has met with some financial difficulties curently. Your objective appears to be getting your husband to work aka finding another job. It makes more sense if you can support him by laying out the facts and see what he has tried. Maybe he is looking for job related to his field, or sneding out resumes and can only wait for replies.2) A dog is a responsibility for life (just like children). If he can give up on the dog, he can give up on anything right? At least that's how i feel. You can't have a perfect man, only perfect actions from the imperfect of everyone. He might be having some self-doubt and require some alone time to think through things.This is based on my own experience, and hopefully it can help you see some light.0 comments2"

Additionally, if your husband had just lost his job, it might be possible that he might be feeling down - and having man's best friend by him could help brighten up his day abit. Perhaps talk to him on what the expenses are for the dog, and how it can be reduced without needing to give up on the dog? I certainly hope the situation has improved!0 comments1"
