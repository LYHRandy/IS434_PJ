question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 26 Nov 2018What tier should I go with Enhanced IncomeShield and which rider should I get?I am 26/M and currently on IncomeShield Plan B (super old plan that is not offered any longer). I am thinking of upgrading to the Enhanced IncomeShield scheme, but I am not sure which tier (Preferred, Advantage, Basic) will be suitable for me. Also, do I need a Plus Rider or is Assist Rider more than sufficient? I am comfortable staying in a B1 ward, based on previous experience.1 answerAnswerBump0"

1,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Go for the highest tier and plus rider if cashflow is not problem. Always have the option to go for private. Most of the experienced doctors are in private practice. I'm not sure what reason for your hospitalisation, but it is a significantly faster and better quality going by private route. 2 comments0"
2,"Question Poster26 Nov 2018Thanks for your perspective! I wouldn't say cash flow isn't an issue, as I intend to get married, have kids and the house is coming in 3 years. Just thinking whether the basic coverage is enough not to make me a bankrupt when *touch wood* tragedy strikes. Cos considering the new changes next year on ISP, Assist Rider is decent at 10% bill payment right? ðŸ˜… Yixiong Chang26 Nov 2018Yes, assist rider is 10% of bill, capped at $3k (for preferred). The difference in premium is about less than $166 a year till age 29, and $286 from 30-34. Assist rider is fine, your risk exposure is limited with it as well. But getting the preferred imo is a must. It gives u options with the plan. 
Do add me on facebook if u require more advice. Are u taking on HDB loan? I can also provide some money efficient advice on it. "
