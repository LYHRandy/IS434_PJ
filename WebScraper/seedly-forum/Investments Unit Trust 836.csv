1,"Elijah Lee, Independent Financial Advisor at Phillip Securities (Jurong East Lite)Top Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 18 Jul 2019There are unit trusts that can deliver decent returns, so 6% is not an unheard of number. However, whether or not one should invest in unit trusts in the first place will come down to a number of factors, includingRisk appetitePreference for asset classes (some UTs are in equities, some are in fixed income, others are mixed)Sector preference (some people like tech stocks and hence tech UTs might be appealing)Analysis of the unit trust also is down to several factors such asVolatilityPeer to peer comparisonSharpe Ratioetc...I presume that your colleague is probably buying from the Navigator Platform when you mention that he bought it from Aviva. What is more important is the actual unit trust that he bought.4 comments7"

4,"Albert Tan, Fin Lit Trainer at MoneyOwlLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 15 Jul 2019The short answer is yes.A unit trust offers a cost effective manner to access a diversified portfolio of investments. As opposed to buying individual shares and bonds to build your own portolio. This diversification can also happen across various countries, industries, asset classes etc.It is also important to take note of the implicit (or hidden) costs of unit trusts. These usually come in the form of annual management fees which are net off your investment holdings. There are a number of platforms offering low cost instruments via low cost unit trusts and ETFs. When you hear of a 6% p.a. return, that is just one side of the story. Always have this habit of probing further. Just like in the world of social media, you almost always only just hear of/see the good stuff. Nobody goes around sharing ""Wow my portfolio has been yielding -6% year on year since I started x years ago!"" It is highly possible his portfolio generated 6% p.a., but how consistent was this performance?Sometimes we may become too caught up in the noises of geopolitical events and make short term decisions which affect our long term goals. Fund returns does not equal investor's returns due to many factors such as exiting the market at the wrong time etc. It does help to have an competent and qualified adviser to walk this investment journey with you through times when the most difficult thing could be to do nothing.1 comment2"

What you should look at in UT depends on
1. risk appetiteEquities or bonds?Do you want dividends?What countries or region are you interested in?What market segment are you favorable in?These are the questions that you should be asking.0 comments0"
