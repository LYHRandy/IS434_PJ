2,Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 20 Feb 2019Saxo is pretty good with fairly competitive commission charges . Robinhood- if I am not wrong works with a different business model and is capturing market with 0% commission rates. Tried creating an account there last time but I had to use foreign banks to do so. Not sure if its more SG friendly now.This page aggregated commission charges pretty well. Be sure to check for the markets you want to trade inhttps://www.valuechampion.sg/average-cost-online-brokerages-singapore#nogo0 comments0
