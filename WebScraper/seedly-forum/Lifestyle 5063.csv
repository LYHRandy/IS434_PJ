1,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Nov 2018Is 2k the take home pay for one person or combined? Assuming it's raw 2k a month, that would means about 1260 max take home pay after CPF per pax. It's not impossible, just have to be very frugal with spendings. Have to lower the 'Spending' category of your budget and it might be harder if haven't gotten a place or planning to have kids.0 comments0"
