If you are investing $10k,get some referral code from the users here so that you and him/her could save on management fee for 6 months.
I wouldn't Comment on the returns since it is suppose to be a long term investment and before you sign up, you have to assess your risk appetite based on the questions they ask you.. Different risk. Indexs would have different supposed returns0 comments1"

There is a risk assessment to help find your preferred risk levels for the portfolio generation.Once you have decided to try, then just put in your funds and let the roboadvisor buy the units for you.....If you think it is working, then you can consider increasing your monthly top-ups etc. So far it is working ok for me and I am happy to do a DCA on a monthly basis.1 comment0"
