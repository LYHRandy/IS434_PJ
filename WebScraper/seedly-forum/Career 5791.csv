question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 20 Jan 2019Should i quit my job which i love but the pay is low?I'm 26yrs old, currently working in a big company with okay benefits for 2 years. I've learnt alot and i iove my job. My boss and colleagues are great too. My pay is $2.1k after cpf. I'm in events/designer line, have a bachelor in architecture. Is the pay low as compared to other companies? Should i quit? I don't think it will increase anytime soon. My colleague has asked for a pay raise before but my boss said it's more about the passion and not the money. This made me afraid to ask for myself.3 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 24 Mar 2019It's great that you love your job and have learnt alot! And to boot, your boss and colleagues are great! It's not often that so many positive factors come together. Look for other jobs so that you have options. When you have options, you might be in a better position to weigh it more objectively. If you are doing a great job, it is likely that the company will value and ask you to stay. This is especially since it is a big company, and HR probably is able to look at cases of increasing pay for exemplary performers. Is it the industry you want to progress in? What are the opportunities to learn more in the firm, or have you exhausted that already? All the best, and treasure the job in any case since there are several plus points!0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 21 Jan 2019Maybe just try to look for other jobs first and see if you like those jobs that also pay well before you quit. Its really your choice in this situation. But do make sure you can find another job before you quit. Maybe work for another year to see how it goes and learn more new skills that can help to get more pay at other jobs.0 comments0"
