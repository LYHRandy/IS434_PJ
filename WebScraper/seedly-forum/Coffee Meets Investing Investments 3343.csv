ProdigyAnswered on 23 Sep 2018As stated by fellow community members, build up your investment knowledge, there are a few financial bloggers who touch on personal fiannce and warn you on the trappings of Singapore society. Some of them include Budget babe and me (yours truly); however if you want in depth and comprehensive table form, you can consider investmentmoats by Kyith. He is very detailed in his write up and puts in mathematical concepts.​As self advertisement: Below is my guide for young investors to know of basic financehttp://investmoolah.blogspot.com/p/good-financial-knowledge-to-learn.html0 comments1"

ProdigyAnswered on 13 Aug 2018 Hi anon, I've shared my thoughts for a question that's very similar to this!​But TLDR:A portion of savings monthly into Robo-advisors and Regular Savings Plans ->  doesn't require much knowledge + easy to set upPut mid-term savings into savings accounts that give bonus interest if you do not withdraw + no penalty for withdrawingAttend investment courses and events to gain exposure -> mostly affordable and some are freeCheck out this article by Seedly's teamHope these helps, all the best! :)​0 comments1"

All investments carry risks so the money that you invest should be the amount of money that you're willing to lose should anything happen. Thus, set up an emergency funds/savings first before investing. To start off, you can consider the STI ETF or robo-advisors0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 20 Sep 2018Before you start investing, you have to consider your objectives.​Many people don't plan, and become resentful later as a result. If their investments are liquid, they'll have many excuses to take them out. Their returns and their capital becomes abysmal over time, instead of high. ​I've also seen people invest out of convenience alone, like in the STI where they've given up their monthly payment plans halfway when they don't get or understand the results they're getting. It's a phenomena developing recently, which I've written over here: https://www.moneymaverickofficial.com/​For first timers, I'd love to take you through a good mix with dividends - so you can see how profits are generated from actual companies you're invested in, and be motivated by the balanced growth before deciding what kind of investment result you want to aim for in line with you objectives.​Do drop me a PM and we can always talk about how I can help you.
