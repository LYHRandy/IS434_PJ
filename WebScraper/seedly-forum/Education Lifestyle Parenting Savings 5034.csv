WizardAnswered on 22 Sep 2018hiMaybe you can look at how much does it cost for the potential program you want to enrol them in, and work backwards to be realistic. Otherwise, we won't know if $500 is sufficient and we also won't know how long do we need to save / invest to be just in time for the usage of the fund. ​Read: https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2018/05/24/child-education-in-singapore-how-much-it-really-costs-and-how-to-save-on-it/​and https://www.valuechampion.sg/2018/05/child-education-singapore-how-much-it-really-costs-and-how-save-it​To find out more on the potential total cost requires and then you can ask the community on how much to save, how long to save and to save / invest in what tools to achieve your target in time :) ​Cheers​​0 comments2"

5,"Conor Gan, Agency Development Manager at AXALevel 2. RookieAnswered on 10 Dec 2018Personally i would suggest to work your way backwards. Reasons on why:Kid education expenses will be a definate thing you would incure in the futureIf you plan without considering the inflation rate, you may fall short of the amount required.Consider the inflation you will be looking at for example a boy would enter uni at 21 and a girl at 19Is the savings plan catered to your needs, i.e you want it to help suppliment for your kid's tuition and at the same time save for their university fees or just for the tuitionI would also suggest to look on endowments that provides significant coupons annually that would suppliment your kid's expenses (tuition, textbooks, pocket money) and at the same time save for their university fees which would be greatly inflated in the time to come. Otherwise, the money saved could also be used for your own leisure / savings / retirement planning.Hope that my suggestion will be useful for you:)0 comments0"

If you don't want to worry about stock market movements, get into high interest savings accounts like cimb's fastsaver, or citibank's maxi gain account. Or consider Singapore savings bonds as well. If you are ok with stocks and have a fairly long horizon, look into dividend aristocrats and kings. Or if US market is not your cup of tea, basket of s-reits (with strong sponsors) with distributions reinvested until you need to start using the funds. 0 comments0"

8,Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Sep 2018Would recommend either POSB SAYE and/or CIMB FastSaver. POSB SAYE gives you 2% interest on the amount inside at the end of 2 years. You can then move the money over to CIMB FastSaver at the end of 2 years to enjoy the 1% interest.0 comments0
