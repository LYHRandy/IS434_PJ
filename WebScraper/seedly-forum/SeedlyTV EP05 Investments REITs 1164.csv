1,"RusminLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 24 May 2019I think it makes sense that lease renewal should be based on latest exchange rate, instead of the old rate when the REIT just got listed. Rupiah has depreciated by almost 50% since day one. So the initial batch of expiring leases would be affected negatively unless Lippo decided to incentivise Siloam hospital. At the end of the day, the likely outcome would depend on Lippo Karawaci's final decision.0 comments2"
