It's great that you're stepping up and preparing yourself with financial knowledge to plan well for your future. However, the cheapest does not always reflect adequate coverage. It's common for people to want to pay the least for insurance coverages.For a young adult, your concerns would be:HealthPlanning for upcoming short term goalsWorking out a strategy for long term goalsWith regards to your health, you should actively seek insurance to cover your-- Hospitalization and Surgery (H&S) via a Integrated Shield Plan (ISP)-- Personal Accident-- Critical IllnessThe main goal is to protect your ability to earn income.With regards to short term goals, you should actively seek to grow your professional development, skillsets and explore ways to increase your income by choosing the right career or negotiating for a higher salary.

As there are too many different benefits from each provider, the most important thing is... what is your needs?You need to identify what are the good to have (which you normally have to pay a premium) versus what are the essentials.Do you really need a final expense? Hospice coverage? New technology like proton beam treatment for cancer? OR just basic hospitalisation? Do take a look at ask more questions ro form your own answer based on your NEEDS. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/almost-complete-guide-understanding-cpf-central-fund-6-loh-tat-tian/0 comments2"
3,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered on 07 Jun 2019Aviva Mindef GTL is not a health insurance policy. Its life insurance.A health insurance policy would be an Integrated Shield Plan in Singapore's context, this covers hospital and surgical costs.There are 7 insurers to choose from. And they have plans ranging from Private Hospital benefit to Govt B1 Ward benefit. The higher the choice of comfort, the higher the premiums. Speak to an Independent Financial Advisor to get a comparison or search online. ISP plan info are all available online.0 comments2"

GeniusAnswered on 07 Jun 20191) Integrated shield plan for hospitalization2) Term life for death, tpd and ciThere are protection only insurance plans.Please, do not mix insurance with investments and buy ilp, endowments and whole life. These are very expensive plans with high premiums but giving low coverage and returns.0 comments1"
5,"Siow NanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019If you are a public servant, then you can consider the public officers group insurance scheme (pogis) under Ntuc income. this is similar to the one offered by Mindef group insurance.  it may be even cheaper but main risk is that you will lose coverage if you leave public service.it may be good to diversify and include other insurances as you have greater income and responsibilities, eg new house, new kids, marriage etc.1 comment1"
6,Siow Nan07 Jun 2019Agree with Hariz too that having an integrated shield plan first would be Important
7,"Bang HongLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 07 Jun 2019I got the NTUC one because it was cheapest at that time with the coverage although all are almost the same, but please note this change from time to time and I last checked NTUC is not the cheapest anymore, but it is okay.I have faith in NTUC maintaining a competitive pricing. Choose a company that you think you can trust and for me it is NTUC Income.0 comments1"
8,EEugeneLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 06 Jun 2019I would say minimally you should get is a hospital plan. Cause that is where the main bulk of expenses would fall under. If you want to know more I can intro you my agent. So far his planning for me is quite good and he plans according to your income.0 comments1
