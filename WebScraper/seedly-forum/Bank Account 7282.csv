Grand MasterAnswered on 24 Sep 2019Nope, there is no need to.Most of the time, at counter service, they almost always ask for your NRIC to verify the identity anyway.Also, most transactions are digital now, using either the digital token in your smartphone or the physical token OR SMS to the verified mobile number.Signatures are no longer that strong and valid, and the banks know that too.0 comments0"
