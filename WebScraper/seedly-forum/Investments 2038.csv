Reading different chart and recognizing pattern. Knowing the support level and the resistance level blah blah blah. I feel like it's more interesting than fundamental analysis but they are both still important and since you are eager to learn, try to google or read up on both :D ohhhhh I think sgx have a few courses for free not sure if they are of any use but worth a shot Good luck0 comments1"
