1,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 29 Jun 2019When its reinvested they would announce quantity of shares reinvested.So you are effectively buying X shares at $1.50 without transaction fees.
So now you just add these and average out with your main holdings the same way as if you buy from broker but without any fees.2 comments0"
2,"Question Poster29 Jun 2019Hi but the extra $0.5 i wont be able to receive back, so do i count it in as well or i dont?Gabriel Tham29 Jun 2019Well, it is like receiving lesser dividend next year. You dont count it in as a loss. It is already reflected in the DRIP, you purchased lesser shares with that amount."
