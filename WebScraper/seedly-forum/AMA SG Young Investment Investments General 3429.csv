1,"Soh Sing Heng, Financial Blogger at SG Young InvestmentLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 09 Sep 2018My portfolio mainly includes dividend stocks like REITs that gives about 5-8% dividends and blue chips companies that pays sustainable good dividends of about 5%. About 70% is made up of dividend stocks and the rest will be value stocks. To be a value investor, more time is needed for research to spot value companies which will grow over the long term. I prefer to structure my portfolio heavier on dividend stocks as it doesn't require a lot of time to manage. I focus more time on growing my savings through higher income. I do not think this will change over the next 5 years. 0 comments1"
