2,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Feb 2019Stock picking also needs to have diversification and is not low risk. Stocks are never low risk. Financial literacy doesnt mean you will always pick the correct stocks and thus low risk with high returns. If you have strong financial literacy but you are not mentally strong and tends to panic a lot , you might constantly panic sell when price drop and lose even more money. No matter what ways you use to invest in stocks, I dont think its a good idea to think stocks are low risk. If you dont have lump sum and you dca on a stock that you did your research on which is stock picking, theres nothing wrong with that.0 comments0"
