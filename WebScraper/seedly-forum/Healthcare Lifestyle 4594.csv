question,Healthcare Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked 2w agoHow do I know which medical screening I should go for?There're so many types of health screening. Basic to comprehensive screening with cost varies. I was introduced this Prumen plan which gives medical screening every 2 years. I have checked the screening covered 21/22 test under Raffles deluxe plus package. Is that sufficient for a checkup every 2 years? Are there other types of insurance that give free medical checkup and cover some illness?1 answerAnswerBump0

God of WisdomAnswered 2w agoHi anon,There's probably no right or wrong answer as to which medical screening you should go to. A quick check on https://www.fullertonhealth.com/our-services/health-screening shows that they offer 4 types of packages between $500 to $1700, and the differences between the cheapest and most expensive package would include things like tonometry and stress ECG, which you might not wish to undergo. So it does depend on you, what do you wish to check for, and how extensively?Hence the question of whether Pruman's health screen package is sufficient will also depend on what you feel you wish to get tested for in a health screening examination. I would say a check-up every 2 years is the norm, but do note that some companies may, as a work benefit, provide you with a free or heavily subsidised health screening benefit, so you might not get as much mileage out of another screening as there would be some overlap. To answer your last question, yes, some insurance companies provide a wellness benefit as part of their critical illness policy, which basically gives you cash periodically to do a health check-up, which may be of interest to you.0 comments2"
