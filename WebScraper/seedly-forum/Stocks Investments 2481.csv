1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 02 Mar 2019Analysts are highly bullish towards nflx, expecting a price targetof $470 per share in 2019. This price target is supported by the strong growth of nflx in terms of global expansion, usage and subscriptions. The most glaring con of nflx as Isaac has mentioned is the high programming costs. Nflx spent $2.1billion on content creation in 2018 and this has number is expected to increase in 2019 as original content remains one of nflx's usp.  Although on a fundamental basis it is expensive, it could possibly be a good long-term investment as netflix is well-positioned for growth in the future.0 comments1"
2,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 28 Feb 2019Based on what i have read, it seems that nflx has been overvalued for a long time, with extraordinarily high pe ratios. Some investors seem to be okay with this kind of valuation because of how fast nfx is growing, as shown by their rapid increase in subsriber base and ebitda growth. These investors award nflx with a growth premium.  However, they also warn that there's a need to watch their competitors also. Aswath damodaran also had a post regarding nflx where using the dcf approach, he concluded that the shares were overalued by quite a bit. (http://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2018/04/netflix-future-of-entertainment-or.html)I have also seen other comparable approaches which showed that the shares are also overvalued. I think operating costs are also quite an issue for netflix, in trying to drive the costs down, since they seem to be more fixed than variable as compared to spotify.0 comments1"
3,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Mar 2019It is my personal take too that Netflix is overvalued- many people are buying in to its amazing growth numbers- pointed out by Isaac, and proven by Damodaran's DCF.That being said, I made a comment recently regarding my take on NFLX's outstanding Oscar performance,  and I stand by my beliefs that fundamental investors on the fence should get some validation on long term outlook from recent news that reaffirms their buy stance. Therefore while IMO NFLX is overvalued, expect the possibility of further rise in prices that would increase P/E further.0 comments0"
