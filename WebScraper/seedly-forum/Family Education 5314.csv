question,"Family Education Asked by AnonymousAsked on 03 Dec 2018My son is studying banking in Polytechnic. He tries hard, but is constantly failing in his studies. He has to repeat a year and the fees are piling up. How do I help him?I'm a single mom, so the school fees are still quite expensive to me. He works part time for his own allowance, but I don't want him to work too much and neglect his own studies either3 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Ck ChaiLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 27 Dec 2018I think you should have a talk with him, to find out what may be the problem that he constantly fails.Is it due to his part-timing causing him lack of stamina on his studies? Like Tat Tian suggested, to take 1 semester break to work and save the money, else to fully concentrate on the studies?Or could it be he is struggling to complete the course which he doesn't enjoy studying? If so, will it be better to drop the course, though seemingly wasting money but constantly failing and repeating the modules is just as costly? Maybe he can temporary join the work force, save up the money then go for part-time / full time studies after he is clear what he is interested in.0 comments0"
2,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 Dec 2018I agree with Yang Teng. Just show care, concern and support to each other. I believe as more communication occurs, its easier to understand the underlying issue of failing. The most likely reason is your son has yet to be able to concentrate or focus on the work in school while juggling his part time job. I am more inclined to ask how is his schedule holding up? Could it be too long drawn and hence he is losing his stamina on his studies? Maybe he may want to take 1 semester break to focus on either working hard for money first, then fully concentrate on his studies. Hope my reply help in resolving the issue.0 comments0"
