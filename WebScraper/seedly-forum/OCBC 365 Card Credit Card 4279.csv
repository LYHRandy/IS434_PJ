question,"OCBC 365 Card Credit Card Asked by AnonymousAsked on 20 Oct 2018Cash back for Chope using OCBC 365 card?Hi all, noted there are changes in the OCBC 365 card. Does any one know if we will get cash rebate if we spend on apps like Chope? Is that considered as dining spend since Deliveroo and Foodpanda are considered.1 answerAnswerBump1"

WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I did an article once on the MCC payment codes... if i remember, I saw that for all such app purchases, they are considered as 'online' payments, unless they are specifically ommited like Dliveroo and Foodpanda (as F&B).For the OCBC365 your online spend rebate is not too bad also? At 3%? 3 comments1"
