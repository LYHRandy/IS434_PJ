1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 30 Sep 2018As I recall from millionaire teacher, there's mention of a global Etf, local country Etf and a bond fund to balance it out. This is what is termed as a couch potato strategy where its rather passive in nature and you can afford to leave it as it is and do rebalancing every quarter or so. So perhaps you can look at vanguard's total world stock Etf, sti Etf and the abf Singapore bond index fund. Couple of ways to go about it. For convenience, you can look to use a broker like dbs vickers to buy all 3 and hold in the same account. This has the issue of higher commissions for the Vanguard Etf. Alternatively, find a low cost broker that can access the US market like Td Ameritrade or interactive brokers to buy into the Vanguard Etf. More active monitoring across 2 different platforms but can save some commissions. Hope this helps 0 comments1"
2,Choon Yuan ChanLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 29 Sep 2018Spdr sti etf and nikko am etf. I will recommend the former because it mirrors the sti index closer and is not overweighted in one sector (banks) There is an abf bind etf. However i feel putting the money in Stu etf or cpf sa is better than the bond etf0 comments0
