Read investment books, and/or attend investment courses (most aren't value-for-money / too costly for too basic content, please read my reviews for the ones I recommend, or read the reviews on Seedly to find out more sentiments). SGX offers some great courses, workshops and free webinars too!Readings:http://www.sgbudgetbabe.com/2017/07/recommended-books-on-personal-finance.htmlhttp://www.sgbudgetbabe.com/2018/02/what-you-must-know-before-investing-in.htmlhttp://www.sgbudgetbabe.com/2018/05/what-stock-can-i-invest-in-that-is-low.htmlhttp://www.sgbudgetbabe.com/2018/08/dr-wealth-factor-based-investing-course.html​Understand yourself and what you're investing for.
