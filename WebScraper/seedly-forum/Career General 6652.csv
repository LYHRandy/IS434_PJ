MasterAnswered on 01 Oct 2018The truth is there are many talents from overseas which are better than local students.​By giving scholarships to such talents you enhance the overall productivity and competitive position of different industries within the country. ​picture it this way if you have a choice to pick the best basketball team in the world and you can choose any player. ​Would you choose the NBA all stars or would you pick an aspiring rookie that may be the best player in Singapore? ​​0 comments0"
