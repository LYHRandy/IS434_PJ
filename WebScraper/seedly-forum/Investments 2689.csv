1,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Feb 2019Hello! Firstly, you should sell your stock if it hits your targeted price. When you first purchase the stock, you should establish a price target or a range of price at which you would consider selling. When your stock reaches the range or the target price you should then proceed to sell it. Secondly, you should sell your stock if you see that the business fundamentals are in decline. It is important to monitor the performance of the underlying business. Next, you should sell a stock should a better opportunity come along. Before owning a stock, compare it with the potential gains of owning another stock. If it is found out that the alternative is better, you should then sell the current stock you own to buy the alternative. Hope this helps! 0 comments0"
