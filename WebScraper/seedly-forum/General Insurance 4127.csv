question,"General Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 05 Sep 2018How does selling insurance policy works?Basically, my friend had convinced me to purchase Pruflexi Cash from her. After a year, I do not believe that it is a right instrument for me. I am aware that I am able to sell my policy to some company. Will I be getting back at least 50% of the premium paid?1 answerAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 07 Sep 2018After a year your surrender value would most likely still be $0. Companies like Reps Holding will only purchase a policy nearer to the maturity of the policy. And they'll give a couple of % points higher than the Surrender Value.0 comments0"
