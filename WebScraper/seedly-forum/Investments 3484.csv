1,Marcus GohLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 10 Jul 2018I believe you are looking at Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) which is more of a dividend investing. You should know the fundamentals and the things to look out for in REITs to maximum your returns like the Gearing Ratio and Distribution Per Unit (DPU) and ultimately do your due digilence. ​Fifthperson has compiled SG REITs data with Live Daily Updates (According to their website) and you could look more about it and make your choices according after doing your homework.https://sreit.fifthperson.com/0 comments1

Moreover, if we talk about  Capitaland Mall and Frasers Centrepoint Trust both are the undervalued stocks, but both has good returns in long term investment. you can check their return stays here https://www.mmfsolutions.sg/blog/best-undervalued-stocks-singapore/0 comments0"

GeniusAnswered on 17 Jul 2018i wrote a short review on retail reits a few months back. if you are just buying 1 lot (1000 units) of CMT, i think it's still ok, but just be prepared for fluctuations. if you are buying even lesser, just check the transaction fees cos usually brokerage charge about $29 per transaction as minimum. 52 Wk Range: 1.95 - 2.17​http://littletoybrush.blogspot.com/2018/03/stock-review-if-i-were-to-pick-retail.html0 comments0"
