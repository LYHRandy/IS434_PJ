1,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019That would make about $6,000 a year. Dividend yield has been increasing over the last 4 years (https://www.dividends.sg/view/G3B). Assuming a 2.55% dividend yield, you will get $153.2 comments2"
2,"Pak Hoon Lum12 Mar 2019Hang on, ES3 pays dividends in Feb and Aug, if you invest $500/mn:
In Feb there's only $1000 that attracts dividends, and in Aug only $4000,
so it will be less. ;-)Lok Yang Teng12 Mar 2019ES3 is for SPDR! You'll be assuming investment starts on Jan. What I assumed however (for simplicity of calculation) is that dividend will be made payable only in Dec."
3,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 08 Mar 2019I think its better to look at dividends in terms of percentage instead of in absolute numbers. In this case, the G3B gives an average dividend yield of 2.5%-3.5%.0 comments1"
