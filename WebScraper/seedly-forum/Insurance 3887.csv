God of WisdomAnswered on 08 Apr 2019The XIRR is between 1.62% (projected at 3.25%) to 3.01% (projected at 4.75%). And the numbers posted looks oddly familiar to Aviva's MyWealthPlan. I highly think it is.In the guaranteed product space, this is the kind of yields you'll possibly get (low 3+% for a 15 year product). It has a higher projected return than SSB but sacrifices liquidity but also has a potential for lower return. But you've sunken in 2000+ dollars already, unless you're changing from guaranteed product to non-guaranteed investment, it would be hard to make up for your sunk cost.0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 08 Apr 2019I generally don't recommend abandoning plans, but its extremely possible to beat 74k in 15 years with the kind of capital you're pouring into it.Even if I only help you invest and yield 4%, you'll still get $80,578 from that capital in 15 years. Thats more than enough to make up for your losses and then some.If we aim for a higher annualized yield, you should be able to get more money. And this is my field of expertise.
