question,"Hospitalisation Insurance (H&S) Insurance Great Eastern SupremeHealth Healthcare Asked by AnonymousAsked 4d agoMy mum wants to get GE SupremeHealth, which rider will be enough?She wants to stay in minimally B1, that would be the Bplus plan? As for the rider, is a classic B Totalhealth enough? Seems it differs from elite B only in copayment (classic B has min copayment 2.5K for inpatient B1? correct me if wrong) or is it that since classic B covers deductible up to copayment but copayment is deductible then actually need to pay the same? If so, then is elite B better cos copayment is 5% of the total bill no min? A bit confused. thanks for any help!1 answerAnswerBump0"

1,"Cheung Jian HuiLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered 3d agoHi for GE hospitalisation riders, for elite rider just understand it as 5% copayment of your bill.For classic rider, it is slightly more complicated.Let's use an example
For a bill of 10KWith elite rider you pay 5% - $500
With classic rider you pay a deductible of 3K and then 5% of remaining 7K.
Hope this clears things up.Do reach out to me if you need more information, I would be glad to help :)0 comments1"
