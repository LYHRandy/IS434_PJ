1,"Jeff Yeo,   amateur Social contributor  at School of social sharingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Apr 2019I feel that endowment plans are for people who have problems keeping up with regular savings The returns and time frame is too long and I feel that it would be better to put the money else where Since you have signed up for one it might be wise to stick with it. Cancelling half way will mean a great lost in capital0 comments3"
2,"KYKo Yang Zhi, Assistant Director, Investment Advisory at Ifast Global MarketsLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019The returns from Endowment Plans aren't great, even in the long run. But it has its merits. Here are some reasons why people get Endowment Plans despite the low returns:1) It forces them to save. Financial success starts with good savings habits. If you want to build a saving habit, and don't have any alternatives (ie. UT/ETF/Stocks/Bonds) that you are comfortable with at the moment, then an endowment plan would be your next best bet.2) They have a goal that requires a sum of money at a planned time period. For example, if you are saving for a big ticket item 10 - 20 years down the road and you want to be certain that you will have money for that. Endowment plan will provide SOME level of guarantee and give you SOME certainty that you can reach that goal. However, the guarantee does come at a cost (of lower returns, and some others). So it depends on which is more important to you - the level of returns OR the guarantee.You should consider stopping the endowment plan if:1) You are struggling to finance this $200/month and this is starting to cause you to eat into your savings. That being said, it is always good to have some stress. Like going to the gym - you wont get muscles if you dont feel the pain. You'll have to judge for yourself, or speak to your financial consultant about this.2) It was an impulse buy. And you are feeling the buyer's regret now. While you will make a loss if you surrender the plan, I think it will be the better choice to surrender it. Simply because this ""buyer's regret"" will keep coming back to haunt you.3) You bought because of chiobu or free gift XD1 comment0"

If you cannot bear to terminate the plan, yet you want to minimise the monthly commitment to that same plan, you can go down to the customer service centre, ask to reduce the Sum Assured to the bare minimum, keep the Crisis-Rider/Crisis-Waiver if possible, thereby you'll minimise the premium payable, free up more cash for yourself.0 comments0"

If want to save for studies in 2 yrs time, just use higher yield savings account.
Depends on what your cash needs are.0 comments0"

GeniusAnswered on 03 May 2019How much are you earning, how much are you saving and what do you intend to do after NS? 200 may be a bit to excessive, if your monthly allowance is 400/500. This is about 40-50% of your monthly allowance! What you may wanna consider, if you want to keep the plan, is to reduce the premiums to say 100, which would be more affordable. Your savings is important as it determines how long you can keep the plan after NS. If you are going for studies, an endowment plan may not be the best option. You also have to plan for the future, in case you do not have a job to fund for the endowment. Next, you have to know what does your endowmen cover, be it in rider, or the usual TPD (Total Permanent Disability) , Death and CI (Critical Illness) coverage. Otherwise, it is comparing a half product which may not be an accurate comparison.0 comments0"
7,"Vinc Tay, Ex-fc at Prudential Assurance CompanyLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 03 May 2019I’d assume that you’re on PruFlexiCash (PFC), and the policy term is for at least 15-25 years. Taking note that such plans let you ”take out early” if need be or continue accumulate till maturity.Note: I have a 70/month PruFlexiCash and was ex-Pru FC.Say you are 22 now. Depending on the term, you get full sum of money back about age 37-47. $200 a month, that’s about 30% of a man’s pay. If you get a part time job after NS (waiting for Uni etc / easily $1k monthly) then you won’t have to dig into your savings to pay monthly premiums. PFC is a good instrument to make sure you save money for future, “in case you forget to”. But of course try to make sure you have at least $10k liquid cash in your bank account as emergency funds. Alternatives: Singapore Savings Bond (guaranteed interest about 1.9-2.5% p.a., can take out any time without penalty) – this one I put few k to sit for 10 years Feel free to clarify if any doubts. Good luck!0 comments0"
8,"Tan Pau CenLevel 1. FreshieUpdated on 17 May 2019My two cents: I personally love endowment plan as it has guaranteed portion, it gives Reversionary bonus, with compounding effect. It has to be a long term, to let the compounding effect works longer and gives better return. Investment does not have guaranteed portion, you may even risk losing all of your capital if you do not monitor your investment closely, which bring me to another good point about Endowment plan that is you do not need to watch your portfolio as intense.Endowment policy plans also generally provides death benefit (commonly 105% of premium paid). Some includes TPD & TI.It ”forces” you  to have a system of savings, you are forced to save Before you spend.as for investing: only goes into that after your have built your emergency fund of 6-12 month of your expenses, also ask yourself, if you loose all the capital, can you still sleep well at night. :)But then if you are still not sure if your current plan is worth continuing , we can discuss over a netmeeting. I am from Pru, should you want a second opinion.0 comments0"

Capital Guaranteed
A good method to ensure that you are disciplined in your savings
Low RiskCons:
Low Returns
Long lock in period
Depending on the type of endowment plan you signed, there may be little or no flexibility in terms of cashflowThere is no such thing as a good or bad product. At the end of the day, what matters is whether the product is suitable for you. If you are not a risk taker or is planning to use the endowment plan for something that is guaranteed in the future, perhaps an endowment plan would be suitable for you.Speak to a trusted financial advisor before you decide to surrender the plan0 comments0"
10,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 26 Apr 2019There is a guaranteed returns portion. Some will have bonus non-guaranteed returns.Long committment period required.Returns are not astronomically high, however its considered lower risk.At the end, depends on what are your needs....don't rush to cancel or surrender without first analyzing your needs and plans0 comments0"
11,"Jason Peh Zhun SenLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 30 Apr 2019Hi there,
i have similarly signed up an endowment fund plan under pru-flexi cash saver during my army days back in 2011. Subsequently, i cancelled it in 2015 after realising the returns were really quite low. I made close to 50% lost after terminating the policy. However, for me i just treat it as paying certain portion for the medical coverage and taking back 50% allowed me to pool my money into stock investments to regain back the losses at a greater return %. You have to think through it properly for your case because it is a long commitment. For my case, i wanted to do force savings and i thought why not endowment since that is one of the tool to use back then when i have not turned 21 yet, not being able to open investment account. Always ask yourself how does the endowment fit into your current financial situation. All the best!0 comments0"
