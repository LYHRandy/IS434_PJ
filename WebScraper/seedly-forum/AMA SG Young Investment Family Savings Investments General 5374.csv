WizardAnswered on 16 Sep 2018Australia or NZ as both consider as an upgrade of lifestyle. ​Australia - Great weather and scenery , healthy food eating culture. Good economy and medical facilities. Good University for grown up kid. ​NZ - Most beautiful country with best scenery same as Switzerland. Real work life and friendly country. Slightly lower by few cents currency as SGD so no lost of retirement funds. Friendly people all around. Great 4 season weather. 0 comments0"

10,"Tan Siak Lim, CFP. Director, Financial Advisory Group at Financial AllianceLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 10 Sep 2018For me, that would be SINGAPORE!!​While most people will likely mention other countries like Thailand or Malaysia, the fact is that most Singaporean do retire in Singapore, by choice. I believe this is because we have all gotten to the way things work in this country, safety, and relatively low cost of living! Yes, if you are ok with hawker food, public transport and public housing, Singapore is inexpensive compared to most other countries. We are voted by EIU to be the most expensive city in the world, based on a lifestyle that no local lives. Even in country like China their basic meal can be RMB 20, for a person earning average income of RMB 4000/month, our basic meal can be as low as SGD 3, for an average guy earning SGD 4000/month. We should not complain.0 comments0"
