1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Mar 2019For 2019, the undervalued sectors are healthcare, industrials and energy. Healthcare stocks were the top-performer in 2018 but it still trades below its average 20-year multiple. The industrial sector sell-off in 2018, caused the sector to fall by 17.3% making stocks cheaper. The energy sell-off in 2014, sent oil prices plunging. In 2018, energy was once again the worst-performing sector. On the bright side, the energy sector is yielding 70% more than its 20 year average, so a rally in 2019 is not unexpected.0 comments1"
