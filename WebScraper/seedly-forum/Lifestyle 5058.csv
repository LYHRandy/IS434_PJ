3,Kenneth Lou23 Nov 2018Cool! haha i dont seem to understand the coupons thing very well. for some strange reason... I tried using some but didnt work. I think my value item was abit lower...Yong Kah Hwee23 Nov 2018Some coupons are specific to a store! So you will only be able to use it on the items they sell. Some also have minimum spending required!

WizardUpdated on 23 Nov 2018Personally, so far I've gotten these:1) https://store.playstation.com/en-sg/home/games Some games on Playstation network.!2) And also the 12 month subscription for Playstation Plus. If you are on PS4. this is MUST GET. There are so many free games every month. Highly recommended Indeed. ($36 for 12 months)3) Google Home Mini on Lazada at $46! :) This is a discounted off the normal $50+ (with additional 1% shopback cashback)4) UPDATING0 comments0"
