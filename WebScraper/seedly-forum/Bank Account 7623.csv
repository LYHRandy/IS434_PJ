1,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 20 May 2018I would recommend the POSB SAYE account​It is a regular savings account and does it automatically. Of course, this is assuming you are earning a salary too.​If you are a student, and not working yet, then you can consider the Basic Bank account from Standard Chartered. No min deposit, no fall below fees. But has a monthly $2 charge. ​If you have at least $1k, definitely go for CIMB fast saver.​https://www.sc.com/sg/save/savings-accounts/basic-bank-account/​https://www.posb.com.sg/personal/deposits/savings-accounts/saye​https://www.cimbbank.com.sg/en/personal/products/accounts/savings-accounts/cimb-fastsaver-account.html0 comments0"
