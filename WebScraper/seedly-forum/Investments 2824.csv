1,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 02 Feb 2019The US market is surprisingly, still overvalued generally.The shutdown is barely affecting anyone domestically, and it's starting to kind of show that you don't need a particularly big government or government budget because otherwise the economical impact would be bigger. Largely its more embarassing for the US than any kind of actual economical impact, though one could certainly be caused if it drags out a lot more. Anything that stops productivity isn't good for the economy. 0 comments0"
