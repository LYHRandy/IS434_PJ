1,"Terence Tan, Finance at Singapore Management UniversityLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 21 Feb 2019Over the years when I invest, I have been trying to figure this question out. That was when I created my first scorecard on July 2015. After many amendments, the scorecard has evolved into the Ultimate Scorecard.My first post on the scorecard method is on Chuan Hup Holding (http://tubinvesting.blogspot.com/2016/02/chuan-hup-holding-ltd-overdue-update.html) in Feb 2016.The main thing about the scorecard method is that it will provide a conclusion by giving score to various different criteria inputted with the latest financial data of the company. This is somewhat similar to stock screening using ratios, but it will provide a conclusion. For the Ultimate Scorecard, it will total up the scores of the various criteria and if it scores 8 or above, it is undervalued.However, there is always the flip side to this kind of investing. As much as you will be unbiased, you should not investing in all the stocks that are deemed undervalued. You have to still do your due diligence and understand what the company is doing.Sometimes, as people say, there is a reason why a stock is undervalued.0 comments1"
2,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Feb 2019Multiples are a quick way to determine if a stock is undervalued or overvalued. The more common ratios to look at are P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA. These ratios can be benchmarked against companies in the same industry. If a stock has a low P/E ratio, it means that the market does not have confidence in the firm's future growth so the stock is undervalued. In other words, if the growth rate is more than the P/E ratio, the company is undervalued. You can also look at the asset value. By looking at the company's balance sheet you can determine the book value of the business. After which, compare the company's book value to market value. Stocks that sell below their actual book value is undervalued. 0 comments1"

ProdigyAnswered on 21 Feb 2019Hi,To spot undervalued stock, you can screen them based on valuation method but my suggestion is to focus on finding good companies first. For me, valuation is always the last when it comes to analysis.  0 comments0"
4,"Isaac ChanLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 21 Feb 2019There are multiple ways that you can value a company's stocks. The ""trading comparables"" (or short for comps) approach is one of the most commonly used methods that Sandra has mentioned.To add to her point, one of the most important factor of this approach would be in how you select your universe of comparables. If you select the wrong companies to compare with, your output will be wrong from the onset.Here are a few factors that you should look out for:(1) Financials: The financials of the company should be somewhat alike. If companies are similar, they would have similar financials also.(2) Industry Classification: What industries do the company belong to? How broad is this industry? Bloomberg has industry codes for classification.(3) Geography: Where are the products sold in? Where are the supplies bought from? Where are the companies main operating activities?I am not sure if others will agree with me, but one of the methods for finding out if a group of companies are appropriate comparables is by looking at the current share price relative to its Last Tweleve Month (LTM) High (I picked this up from Rosenbaum and Pearl in their book). Basically, if a group of companies' share prices are trading relatively similar to each of their individual highest share price in the LTM high then they should be good comparables. This would be a way more for filtering out companies that should not be compared with against each other.To find out more about this approach of valuation, do check out this video which gives an in-depth approach.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4_eKPJmy1E0 comments0"
