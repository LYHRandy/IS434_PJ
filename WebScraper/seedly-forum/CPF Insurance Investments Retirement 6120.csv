1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 27 Jun 2019Any lifetime income annuity policy would suffice. I could show you a few if you'd like from multiple insurers. I have the calculations and projections made for different age groups.
Only issue is that CPF is known to change the black and white from time to time, so this rule may not be in effect when you're 55, so that's the issue.2 comments3"
2,"Zen Rogue Xuan26 Jun 2019Thank You!Hariz Arthur Maloy27 Jun 2019Oh Zen, forgot to mention, you don't have to opt out 100%, you can get a partial exemption as well, and have lesser in your RA when forming the CPF Life payout. So you can have a private annuity paying 75% and CPF Life topping up the 25% to form the estimated Standard Plan payout."
3,"Clarence Chua, Financial Planning Specialist at Prudential Assurance SingaporeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterAnswered on 27 Jun 2019CPF has the right to change this as per what Hariz has mentioned.Other than that, any Income annuity will get you exemption. Though I would not want to exit from CPF life totally, itâ€™s a good plan and CPF has one of the best interests rate today and if you are drawing an employee salary you will be making contribution to it monthly.0 comments2"
4,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusUpdated on 28 Jun 2019revised answer in consideration of the comments below, and I don't believe continuing the discussion is beneficialI think most insurers have said it was very difficult (if not impossible) to beat risk free 4%. Initially I thought this was a well meaning question, but the more I thought about the exchange, I believe this was a loaded question, because a) it started out as comparing private annuity to cpf life, and b) ended up bashing cpf life for not leaving a bequest at the later stage of life.its like evaluating a guide dog on its ability to lay eggs, when you got it to lead you because you cant see anymoreBut end of day its your money. If you believe the private annuity to do better than cpf life, then go for it. If you believe the bequest is more important than the monthly payments to sustain your lifestyle through those old age days. If you believe guaranteed 4% is worse than guaranteed 2+% with non-guaranteed returns. When the best way to compare is the amount of money you put in, vs the money you took out over the full term of the policy, and not just entirely based on the last remaining bequest.Consider these questions when considering the private annuity
1) what is the cost / annual premiums required to achieve the same level payout as cpf life?
2) can you afford that premium?
3) how likely do you feel that the insurer may go bankrupt vs cpf board?
4) what is the rate of return they put in the policy?
5) what is exactly guaranteed in the terms and conditions of the policy?My first thoughts, most insurers cannot guaranteed they will beat 4% annual return. If you remember the 2008 financial crisis, there were a number of insurers that needed to be bailed out by US govt. And I doubt the t&c will write down that the company guarantees better than 4%.Further points to highlight on reading example of Aviva MyLife plan which is listed in commentsnote the fine print and what is guaranteed. For example guaranteed increase in surrender value of only 0.25% (from 5th yr onwards), and the capital guarantee is only on the nominal sum of premiums paid (ie the returns or interest equivalent on your premiums does not form part of capital guarantee - 4% compounding interest over a 20 year term is probably quite a big deal to miss out on)guaranteed return is only 2.2% on brochure but the projected returns of 3+% and 4+% are often used to illustrate bonus / non-guaranteed returns. Take note that it is an illustration and you could get something worse or better than that. (i will believe it tends to be worse in reality)when you have the benefits and payout schedule in front of you, take note there should be an insurance / admin cost column next to your age and premiums paid column. The insurance cost is usually high and could be a substantial amount of the first two years premium. Do a calculation of how much that is compounded at 4% over 20 years.when evaluating your investment return, from a valuation point of view, it would be better to exclude the terminal bonus which you will not get on surrender, but could form part of the bequest.Humble opinion - I think private annuities are worth exploring, but I definitely do not see them as a direct subsitute for CPF life. They could be complementary / add-on supplements based on individual preference. One key objective of CPF life is to provide life long payments, which may or may not be enough for own needs, but at least its there. Once you live beyond 70, odds are inflation will eat into the real purchasing power of the payout, and minimizing your burden on loved ones might be a higher priority than leaving a bequest, especially for those who did not have a good start in life.Do conduct a through and detailed evaluation / comparison to get a feel of the minimum guaranteed, the middle ground (assuming low rate of return), and the upside (which could be all airy fairy and never happen at all). Would your decision change if you ignore the illustrated returns tables, and consider only the minimum guaranteed or maybe minimum +1%?I dont know about you, but I had enough of the two %s often used to illustrate the returns, because more than half the time I encounter, the policies I had terminated failed to repeatedly meet either of them.9 comments0"
5,"See all 9 comments T@Takingstock @27 Jun 2019I feel like I am getting lost. I think cpf life was to help make sure people could get payout as long as they live. 

Your concern is you would prefer less payout for your day to day living, so you have ""net worth"" to live for the next gen. Or did I miss it in that you wanted both high payout and net worth to bequest?

Example:
