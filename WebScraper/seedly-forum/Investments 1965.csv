REITs are required to distribute 90% of their income to enjoy tax exemption and as a result they are not able to build cash reserves and thus are highly dependent on debt for financing. This makes them susceptible to interest rate movements. For instance, an interest rate hike would causethe REIT's interest expense to increase thus decreasing the distributable income and negatively impacting the distribution yield of the REIT. As REITs are unable to build cash reserves, REITs often issue rights or conduct private placement to raise equity. These rights offering could potentially dilute current investors' stake. The borrowing of REITs tend to be short-term (less than 10 years to maturity). This requires REITs to constantly need to refinance their borrowings for long-term assets. There is a risk that the REIT would not be able to fund refinancing options when its short-term debt is due.0 comments1"
