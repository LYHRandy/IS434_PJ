WizardAnswered on 19 Sep 2018Dr. Wealth has covered this question before, let's read it from the expert: https://www.drwealth.com/how-much-should-i-invest-in-1-stock/​He shared that "" If you take the $10 cost and divide it by the minimum commission of 1%. This gives you a figure of $1,000.This means that if you want to keep your cost within 1% of your investment capital, you should invest a minimum of $1,000 (assuming your cost is $10)."" ​0 comments0"

4,"Jay Liu, Diploma in Accountancy  at KHEALevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Sep 2018You can start investing with $100 by doing RSP. As the commission for single trade can cost usually $25 commission. So only do that if you have high capital. But there are pros and cons. RSP transact once a month. While the other can invest anytime you want. 0 comments0"

6,ZeeeeeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 18 Sep 2018Well for DBS and OCBC they charge $25 worth of transaction fee so I kinda calculate the potential dividends I can receive in the first year and ensure it is more than the commission fee. Thereafter it's a matter of letting it grow + accumulating more dividends! 0 comments0

(Fundsupermart, Stanchart)Usual brokerage comm is $25 + gst, svc fees etc. = $28+​I would recommend investing at least $3 - 5k one shot to make it worthwhile. Comm should not be shaving off >3% of your returns at the initial start.​0 comments0"

ProdigyAnswered on 16 Aug 2018You can start investing with as low as a few hundred dollars, depending on how expensive the stock you like to purchase is. Stock exchange platform has fees range between $10 to $25 per transaction with a maximum percentage tagged to the transaction amount. To maximise the percentage, you'll need about $5000 to $10000 in each transaction. 0 comments0"
