2,Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Mar 2019Hello!I personally would choose the 6-month intership over the good paying job. I think it is very important to be able to learn as much skills as possible when you have the opportunity. I am currently in uni and i realised how important skills are in terms of getting exco positions in clubs and also when applying for internships during the holidays. If you are not in need of the money i think that internship would be a better choice as compared to a high paying job. hope this helps and enjoy yourself before uni starts!0 comments1

The credentials and experience you get at this point of your life will be valuable, and you will also gain more insight into the industry as compared to your peers. This can affect how you see your school life in the future and the choices you make.1 comment1"

6,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Feb 2019I was at the same stage as you about 8 years back. I chose to go into the sales line selling Time Magazine and other educational editorials to schools. The pay was great then about S$3k per month for 3 months considering that I just finished NS. The skills and people that I met during that short stint really taught me some life skills such as Communication, Relationship Management, Sales, Public Speaking etc.As for internships, it would also be beneficial if you know what you intend to pursue later on in the career. Given an option to turn back time, i woud still have gone for the sales job which i took up since the next 4 years in University would easily expose me to internships after internships every summer break0 comments0"

WonderkidUpdated on 14 Feb 2019Like what the others have said, the internship is a better choice if it is related to what you'll be studying and money is not an issue.Who knows, if they like you and you enjoy the environment, you can intern with then again during your uni (depending on your school's intern arrangements) or maybe try for another company altogether. If you choose former, you'd probably have a high chance for getting hired by that company when you gad (no promises though). If it's the latter, you'll get more exposure into the industry.So it's a win-win cause you have the rest of your life to earn money. 0 comments0"
8,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019You are waiting to go university. I think experience would be better as the experience and knowledge can not only help in the future, can also be useful when you enter university. If you are in need of money, good paying job will be beneficial but getting experience would be a better choice since you are still young.1 comment0"
