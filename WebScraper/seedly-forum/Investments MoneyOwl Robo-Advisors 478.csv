1,"LTLena TengLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 06 Jul 2019Hi Anonymous, It’s great that you are seeking answers so don’t feel sorry about it. I am from MoneyOwl and I’ll be glad to address your questions.First off, MoneyOwl isn’t just a robo-advisor, we’re a bionic financial adviser that can look into all your financial planning needs across budgeting, insurance, investment, estate planning while incorporating national schemes such as CPF into our planning framework. As for our investment ideology, fundamentally we believe that markets are efficient hence there is little incremental value in trying to find mispriced stocks and/or time the market. The data speaks for itself. Many active fund managers, i.e. those who seek to find mispricing in the market and trade on those information, have not been able to consistently outperform their benchmarks. But don’t just hear it from us. Check out the latest SPIVA report to determine this yourself. So we don’t pick stocks since we trust the market.So how do we help our clients?Broad Diversification - We do this by designing portfolios that will help them get the average market returns (about 7% p.a.) over the long term which for most purposes enables them to meet their goals. This is also why our portfolios are very broadly diversified across countries and sectors so that we don’t miss out on potential upturns in any year, and also lowers our country, sector or company-specific risks. In our equity portfolios, we have exposure to both developed and emerging markets across the globe and for bonds, we invest in global bonds hedged to SGD with the main purpose of reducing the volatility in our investments. Under Dimensional’s funds, our portfolios have exposure to more than 8,000 equities and 200 bonds.Low costs – We focus on the one thing that we can control – investment costs because it will certainly erode your returns especially in the long run. Our total fees ranges around 1.14% - 1.2% p.a. which is comparatively lower than many of the actively managed funds since paying more hasn’t proven to deliver better results. However, we don’t aim to have the lowest cost and I’m sure you can find other providers that can beat us, or better still if you can invest DIY. Dimensional strictly isn’t passive investing either because they do try and improve returns by tilting towards securities that are small caps, value and profitable which have shown to offer premiums in returns persistently, and they do this by trading very efficiently so that it minimises cost to the investor.Staying Invested – The last and perhaps most important factor to successful investing is you, specifically your ability to stay invested to reap the market returns regardless of all the noise you hear out there. This is why we believe in the importance of having an adviser or risk coach who ensures that your need, ability and willingness to take risk is aligned to the portfolio you are investing in throughout your life stages. This requires an understanding of your goals, your financial situation both now and in future as well as your attitudes towards money. Many of these things require the human touch and may not be easily replicated through technology at the moment. Dimensional understands this well too, hence their funds can only be distributed through financial advisers. Find out more about our investment ideology - https://advice.moneyowl.com.sg/the-right-way-to-invest/On your second question about whether Dimensional Fund is a unit trust, it is. As to why we chose a unit trust structure instead of an ETF, this is because as a social enterprise, MoneyOwl seeks to provide solutions for the man in the street so that they can start investing from as little as $50 per month. For those of us who are just starting to build our wealth, a regular savings plan (RSPs) is the most disciplined way for us to do so without having to wait till we amass a lump sum. For this reason, while ETFs listed on overseas exchanges were considered, they are not suitable for small investments as the amount invested might not be enough to buy whole shares and investors would end up either with fractional shares, or not be fully invested. We are not comfortable with fractional shares of ETFs as legal ownership is not clear. There is no such problem with unit trusts/ funds. There are a few additional issues of withholding/estate taxes, bid-ask spreads, forex spreads etc. esp for US-listed ETFs which you can read on in this article https://advice.moneyowl.com.sg/why-unit-trusts-and-not-etf/.2 comments10"
2,"Question Poster06 Jul 2019Thank you for the Reply! This is very comprehensive and useful! Are there dividends earned on the funds? And if yes, are they automatically re-invested?LTLena Teng06 Jul 2019Yes there are dividends earned on the funds and they are automatically reinvested to help you accumulate and grow your portfolio."
3,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered on 05 Jul 2019Not from MoneyOwl but yes currently their portfolios are built using Unit Trusts FROM Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA).DFA as a fund house believes in data driven investment decisions. From their nobel winning research on market premiums (additional market returns), small cap companies perform better than large cap, value performs better than growth, and profitable companies do better than less profitable ones.They've built indices to track these dimensions as they call it and then created investment products to replicate them.Their funds are not 100% passive, but its almost like it because they track the index they create.So if you're a value investor and wants exposure to global equities, DFA is a great way to dip your feet into thousands of stocks at the same time. I'm an IFA that distributes DFA as well and for clients who align closely to the research done and want an almost passive portfolio at a low cost, I'll use DFA.0 comments3"
