1,"Bang HongLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 20 Jul 2018I would pay ""little"" and i think it is practical to drag out loan over time. The answer is obvious, I am seeing there is a gap which i can gain.​Interests rate = 1.88% for housing loanInvestment return = 3-5% for a reatively conservative ​Instead of paying my loan, I will drag as long as the economy on my side. Monitoring every quarterly closely should be more than sufficient, rates wont go up overnight unless there is a crisis. ​There will be risks involved in this approach, but to leverage the ""gap"", yes it is worth it for me and many others.0 comments1"
2,"Choon Yuan ChanLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 06 Aug 2018You are absolutely right on this. Home loans at current rates are too low (1.88-2.00% interest only). Conversely, investment returns can return a decent 3-4%. Conversely, instead of paying a huge chunk of your housing principle, you can consider topping into CPF-SA to get 4% returns and tax savings.​Until housing interest for floating rates heads to 3%, i do agree on your view to pay little and channel the excess funds to either (i)  gain exposure in investing or (ii) build up your retirement fund by doing contribution to CPF SA0 comments0"

Reservist man!​While I agree that a percentage of us might be able to generate an OK return on investment, the talk I gave was to give a general perspective on how an average Singaporean can manage their asset allocation.​For someone who is confident of generating an investment with returns higher than interest rate of his loan, feel free to do so. As for those, who are less confident or have no experience doing so, please clear the loans first. It beats trying to beat the interest rate on investments which one is unsure of, incur a loss and still be slapped with an interest rate on loans to pay out. ​One can reason that he will monitor the market really closely, but how many of us actually has the discipline to carry on this habit for years, especially when you are not in the finance industry? ​Cheers man!0 comments0"
