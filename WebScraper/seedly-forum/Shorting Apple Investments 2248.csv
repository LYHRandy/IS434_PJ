1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 13 Mar 2019Some stats released for Apple in Japan's market. While Japan might not be an especially big market, I still think the data shows is quite telling and might be comparable to the trends in other countries as well.If I were to short AAPL however I would not look purely at their phone sales- although this has been their biggest bread and butter. I have been following their Macbook 2019 Rumours- the current problems in 2016-2018 Macbooks(heating, keyboard) seem to be unaddressable and tied to their structural limitation of slim and compactness. It is rumoured they might be making 16 inch macbooks and to finally tackle heating issues.Wins wise- Airpods has been a resounding success and is looking to announce Airpods 2. TV Streaming and news subscription services are set to be announced- although I am dubious on their ability to outmatch NFLX and DSNY's content generation.If anything, look to Tim Cook's big address on 25th March to make your decision. However knowing AAPL's capable management, with so much on the line with the consistent bad news hitting them, I believe Tim Cook will be able to spin a win from their narrative on 25th.0 comments1"
2,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 13 Mar 2019Personally, I wouldn't just peg to their iPhone sales, although it seems that the bulk of their sales (60%) are attributed to iPhone. But the services function of Apple seem promising, with strong gorss margisn of 62%, and increasing number of diversified services coming in as well, such as Apple News. Their Apple Streaming services are also projected to be quite a big hit as well, with the aim of getting 100m users in 3 years. For me, I believe Apple is in a league of their own.0 comments0"
