1,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 25 Aug 2019Try to stay away from penny stocks. Many people get burned there. No liquidity and can be suspended or halted anytime then you will be stuck.Short term or long term depends on yourself and your strategy. Which ones are you good at? There are successful day traders and forex traders, there are also successful long term investors.0 comments1"
