1,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019No stock stays hot forever. Buy a fund, makes sure it beats the tech fund market (it can) such as the QQQ index and just hold onto that and let the work happen for you.Also Isaac, you work too long and too hard for the money you're being paid. It's Saturday, take a nap.1 comment0"
