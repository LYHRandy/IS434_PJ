It only takes maybe an hour max. You can read more here: https://blog.seedly.sg/working-adults-what-are-the-key-insurance-policies-you-should-get-in-singapore/​I Suggest: A Quick 30 min ExerciseReview your insurance policies (either by calling up your agent for a review, Google search)Look for these 2 key essential type of policies: A Health policy (hospitalisation & surgical, private hospital cover) and A Life policy (Understand if it’s a term or life)If you still need help, feel free to post it here on our QnA where many have done so beforeEverything else is a bonus to have based on varying situation (The policy names may be fancy but their updated websites should clearly state which type of policy it is)Most important ones are describe at the top: Health and Life policy. In fact since you are from the Army or MHA or Mindef, you should seriously consider the AVIVA Group Insurance policy. Extremely affordable and beffiting for young working adults :) Find out more why here: https://blog.seedly.sg/should-you-cancel-your-aviva-mindefmha-group-insurance-after-you-ord/0 comments2"
2,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019The more essential insurance to get are:​Life insurance/Critical illnessHospitalization and surgical insurance (H&S)​You can add on other insurance such as disability income insurance, personal accident insurance.​How to choose agent?Same with all products, compare agents. You can get independent advisors, or company tied advisors. Get different quotations, compare.No one can force you to sign on a policy, so comparing is very important.​Or you can try out the DIY insurance portal: https://www.diyinsurance.com.sg/portal/home/​I not from DIYinsurance, but I like to use it. Quotation free one.1 comment1"
