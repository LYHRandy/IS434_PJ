question,"Stocks Discussion Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 20 Jun 2019Would it be a good move to liquidate existing good yield stocks in my portfolio to recycle the capital to potential high growth ones?Hello! My current portfolio contains some banking and retail stocks which i've purchased long ago, and are giving me some good dividend yield of 6-7%. However, their capital growth seems to have stagnated. These stocks account for 45% of the portfolio.At the same time, i've identified some high growth stocks, and was wondering if it would be a good move to liquidate the above mentioned ones to recycle the capital to these potential ones?1 answerAnswerBump0"

1,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 21 Jun 2019Are you looking towards a income portfolio or a growth portfolio?
If you are creating a stable passive income portfolio, why not just hold and collect dividends if the fundamentals remain good?If you are creating a growth portfolio, and you have identified potential growth investments, then probably good to get into them while they are undervalued.
Key point is what is the objective? income or growth?2 comments1"
2,"Question Poster21 Jun 2019Thanks Gabriel! At this point i'm looking at both. Not sure if it's ideal to pursue both objectives of having dividends on 1 side while looking for growth on the other.

On that basis, if i'm looking at both, the best option would then probably be to keep the dividend stocks and inject more capital?Gabriel Tham21 Jun 2019Yea, I guess if you want both then perhaps injecting new capital would be the better option. Eventually the growth stock would reach a target price for you to sell and you can pump it back to the dividend portion."
