1,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Technically QQQ is not known as nasdaq 100. QQQ is known as 'cubes', it is an ETF that tracks the INDEX (Nasdaq 100). There are other funds that tracks the nasdaq100.Cubes is among the most traded ETF. It is also has low expense ratio and best tracking performance YTD. Are u actually asking about QQQ the ETF itself or about the nature of the index Nasdaq100? They are different.2 comments0"
2,"Question Poster16 Nov 2018QQQ etf itself, some people might not understand qqq so i added nasdaq 100.Yixiong Chang16 Nov 2018Well, it is by far the best etf for nasq100. It is the most liquid, and best performance (lowest tracking error) among the few etf tracking nasq100. 

If u want exposure to nasq100, it is the go to etf. "
3,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 16 Nov 2018The management cost is reasonable at 0.2%. Top 3 sectors are technology 61.33% (includes FANG), consumer cyclicals 21.04% and healthcare 9.10%. Top 2 countries are United States 98.15% and China 1.43%. The 5 and 10 year performance seems good at 15.80% and 20.21% (higher than NASDAQ-100) respectively. Some dividends are tax-payable. While the ETF invests in large companies, it's quite susceptible to shocks in tech industries and US domestic economy in the short run. Long term wise does seem decent, I feel.0 comments0"
