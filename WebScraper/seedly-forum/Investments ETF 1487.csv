2,"Billy Ko, President - Investment Club at Singapore Institute Of TechnologyLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Apr 2019The rationale behind dollar cost averaging (DCA) is the discipline in purchasing a stipulated value of stocks / ETF on a regular basis. It works on ETFs because it is what banks / brokers offer through Regular Savings Plan (RSP) that allows one to automatically practice DCA. It definitely can be practised on stocks / shares too - Phillip Securities does have standalone shares which they include in their RSPs called Share Builders Plan ( https://www.poems.com.sg/rsp/#home) However, if one intends to do it manually, one has to note the commission one has to foot For e.g. If one wants to purchase a $100 worth of RSP / stocks on a monthly basisCommission % for DCA for purchasing ETF's via RSP = min. $1 (1%)Commission % for DCA for purchasing stocks manually = min. $10 (10%)Hence it isn't very feasible practising DCA on stocks through the markets manually0 comments0"
