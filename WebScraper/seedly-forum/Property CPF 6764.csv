question,"Property CPF Asked by AnonymousAsked on 12 Sep 2019Does it make sense for me to pay monthly property mortgage by cash?About $100k in various investments, $40k cash savings, protection plans sorted. With a combined income of ~$12k (before less CPF), took a DBS home loan. Thinking whether to pay monthly HDB mortgage of ~$1.8k by cash rather than CPF since (1) collect CPF 2.5% interest, (2) I can afford it now and can switch to paying by CPF if I need the cash flow subsequently rather taking eating straight into my savings (e.g retrenchment or wife stop working to take care of kids). Does this make sense?1 answerAnswerBump0"

I have very little CPF since I operate my own business and has very little CPF in my OA account.2) Choose to do so willingly, as they know they have to pay back the CPF with accrued interest (at 2.5% per year) when they sell off their properties.If it's me, I will maximise as much CPF as possible. Sure, I have to pay back 2.5% pa accrued later (accumulated it's going to be a big sum) but it's still to myself...and let's be honest with all of us, cash is king.You can see your cash, but it's very difficult to see your CPF outside the.. building.0 comments1"
