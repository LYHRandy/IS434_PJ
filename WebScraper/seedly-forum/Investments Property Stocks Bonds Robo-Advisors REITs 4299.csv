1,"Vincent Tan Wen Bin, Assistant Vice President at Thinkers AllianceLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 28 May 2019If I were you I will start off with learning about investments before I made any. I jumped blindly into investments before and lost money due to lack of education in the investment instrument. So the first step is to invest in your own knowledge to start your investment journey. If you are busy and this is not your area of interest, engage a professional financial advisor and work through with them. Let me know if you need more info.0 comments1"
