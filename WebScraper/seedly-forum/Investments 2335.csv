1,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Mar 2019I believe the economic reports you are referring to in this case are the reports on GDP?In the case of US, many would argue that its not really relevant. This is due to the fact that in every quarter/month, there will be reports serving as an indicator of how the economy is doing and the GDP reports function as a mere confirmation of these preceding reports. For instance, they have monthly non-farm payroll indicator, representing the total number of paid U.S. workers of any business, excluding general government employees, private household employees of non-profit organizations that provide assistance to individuals, and farm employees. This serves as a gauge of economic growth as well as inflation.Moreover, the US frequently releases reports on its Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which measures the activity level of purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector; below 50 indicates contraction.In such a context, these reports/indicators serve as a ""real-time"" indicator of the health of the economy, and isn't as ""delayed"" as reports on GDP growth, which can also be roughly estimated based on datas from these indices.0 comments3"
