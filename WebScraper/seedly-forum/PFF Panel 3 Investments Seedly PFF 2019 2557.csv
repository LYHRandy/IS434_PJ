WonderkidAnswered on 20 Jun 2019My personal opinion is that TA is more appropriate for momentum driven stocks, which would be your typical growth / hype stocks (technology, biotech, crypto). FA would be more appropriate for your value stocks (banks, reits). That said, people usually use either one or even both as signals in their decision making process (it lends you a bit of comfort in making the buy/sell decision, because it seems a little more scientific than arbitrarily buying at market last price).0 comments0"
