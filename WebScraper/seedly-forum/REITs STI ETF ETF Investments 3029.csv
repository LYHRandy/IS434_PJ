question,"REITs STI ETF ETF Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 18 Nov 2018How should a situation of rising interest rates affect your portfolio / investment strategy? What should you invest in, to hedge against it?Beginner question here.

Investors will move their money away from stocks and bond since interest rates are higher (Bond yield have inverse relationship with i/r). REITs will do better since increase in i/r suggests better economic performance. Since you are doing ETF, there is already diversification of cyclical and non-cyclical stocks.0 comments0"
