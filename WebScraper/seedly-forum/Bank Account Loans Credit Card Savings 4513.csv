1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 17 Sep 2019Your question, to be honest, is very vague. What do you exactly want to know?DBS cards are credit cards that you can use for your everyday expenses. you can apply for a DBS card as long as you hit the minimum annual income of 30K.Unsecured Loans are loans that you take without pledging anything to the bank. The term unsecured means it is not backed by anything.1 comment0"
