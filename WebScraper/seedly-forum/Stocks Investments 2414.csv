1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 06 Mar 2019I'll look for 6-8+% yield on my income floor portfolio, comprising mostly reits and other trusts. This is my gauge when looking for a new counter to go into. Of cos, the fundamentals shld be ok as well0 comments0"
2,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 06 Mar 2019It really depends on your risk appetite. If you are a risk averse person, then 3-4% would be good.If are a high-risk taker, then maybe 8% cannot even be considered good for you.I would say that 5-8% is pretty decent, at least to me.0 comments0"
