WizardAnswered on 19 Mar 2019I guess most people head to The Arcade where there are over 20 money changes - which is why people feel they offer the best rates. But do your own research and check! Exchange rates vary from shop to shop, depending on your currencies requested for :)Additionally, if you are looking to exchange more money, it is possible to negotiate for a better rate.0 comments1"
