1,"Josh Tan Jian LiangLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 17 Feb 2019Hi anonymous, I saw your reply below. If delivery was in a private hospital and a pregnancy complication happens that is within your ISP, a proration factor would kick in. This means a large part of your bill cannot be claimed. Hence, it is a valid concern for upgrading for possible pregnancy complication needs. There is a waiting period of 10months usually before pregnancy complications can be covered. If you would like to upgrade, most insurers have at present moment launched their new 5% co-payment rider plans.Understand your current ISP for its pregnancy coverage.I've a summary here for you https://www.theastuteparent.com/2017/05/pregnancy-complications-integrated-shield-plan/Good luck and take care0 comments0"
2,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 08 Feb 2019Having the option of going to private care is a huge advantage. I fully understand the difference in how the private care will make in a critical situation. The new ruling will also limit copayment to $3k a year. It will be a very manageable risk against the lower premium comparatively u will be paying. Since u are already fully insured for public hospital, it doesnt harm to wait a few months (1st April) to see what the new plans will be like. Sign up after that, at least it will be much clearer for u, rather than letting your plan autotransition to the new plan.0 comments0"
