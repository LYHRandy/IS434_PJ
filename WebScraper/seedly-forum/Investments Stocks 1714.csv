1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 24 May 2019When I was working as an equities analyst - I had the usual triple screen Bloomberg set-up to reference daily. Because of that, I was able to check the news and stock movements every morning, so much so that it was the replacement for reading the papers in the morning. If there are specific companies that you are interested in, you can easily set up alerts for it!0 comments0"
