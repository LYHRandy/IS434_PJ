1,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Dec 2018To calculate your own assessable income, calculate your take home pay. Use the form IRAS have for income tax to calculate this year possible tax.https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Quick-Links/Calculators/Go to individual and download it. The reason why I asked take home pay is because if you used gross salary, you need to calculate the tax relief (which is contributed to CPF). 0 comments0"
