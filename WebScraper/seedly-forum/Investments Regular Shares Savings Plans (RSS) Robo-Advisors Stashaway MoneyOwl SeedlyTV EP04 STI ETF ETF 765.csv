question,"Investments Regular Shares Savings Plans (RSS) Robo-Advisors Stashaway MoneyOwl SeedlyTV EP04 STI ETF ETF Asked by E-An TanAsked on 22 Jul 2019How should I begin investing as an NSF?Currently an NSF looking into investments after reading up on it. I want to maximise my current advantage of time and a high-risk appetite. I'm thinking of using RSS to venture into STI ETF, and robo-advisors such as Stashaway and Money Owl to get exposure to international markets. Is this a viable strategy? Will my low monthly contributions ($100 each hypothetically) hurt my profits significantly?1 answerAnswerBump0"

It will affect if you are doing manual transactions and the broker fees eat up most of the amount.Roboadvisors charge based on AUM, assets under management. So it will be a % based on your total assets with them.0 comments0"
