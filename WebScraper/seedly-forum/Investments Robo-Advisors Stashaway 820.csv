1,"Eddy CheongLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 19 Jul 2019Hi Shannon, thanks for your question. My name is Eddy Cheong, Chief Advisory Officer of MoneyOwl, and I would like to share what we believe in and how we deliver our investment services for clients.MoneyOwl believes that good advice helps to bring about a successful investing experience and that such advice must involve a human element. Advice includes asset allocation, risk profiling, fund selection, monitoring, rebalancing and very importantly risk coaching to help investors stay invested through turbulent market times. There are many reports that show that investors lose out on market return because they panic and sell too early. Thus an adviser adds value when he or she can help investors understand how markets work and stay invested over the long term in order to capture market return, rather than time the market.
Our investment philosophy and the expression of it through the way we construct and manage portfolios - when coupled with advice - give clients a very good chance of a successful investing experience. Because we are at our core advisors, more than fund managers, (even though we have a full-fledged fund management licence), we do not define successful investing as being about maximising return or even maximising risk-adjusted return. Rather, we want to advise and structure investments for clients in such a way as to give you the best odds of meeting your goals. From a combination of evidence we have examined and experience including across the GFC, we know that the keys to successful investing lie in 4 areas: being globally diversifiedaiming for market-based return, rather than trying to beat the market through ""active management"" (either by adjusting asset allocations tactically in response to reading of economic conditions, forecasts or events); keeping costs low; and staying invested over the long term.You can find more information here: https://advice.moneyowl.com.sg/the-right-way-to-invest/1 comment5"
2,Shannon Tan19 Jul 2019Hi Eddy! Thank you for the comprehensive reply. Is there an optimal amount of money per month that you believe can see significant impact in the returns? I understand that you cater to different risk groups but i am pretty risk adverse myself and i do not want to invest alot per month but i also do not want to invest too little which results in insignificant returns. Would there be a sweetspot amount that you can recommend? Thanks in advance!
