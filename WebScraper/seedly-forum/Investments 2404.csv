1,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Mar 2019The 8th wonder of the world: compounding. This effect of allowing you to earn returns on top of your capital gains is what makes investment so attractive, and so exponential in terms of allowing you to grow your wealth. Thats why you should always start early, so that you can take advatange of time, as time is your friend with regards to compounding. If you invested $1000, at an average annualized rate of 8% for 30 years you will receive $10062.27 - a 10 fold increase in your wealth. Imagine 10 000, or even 100000!But there is also costs, and with regards to costs, time is not your friend, but your enemy. If you do not make sure to check the costs of your funds or ETFs that you may buy into, you may incur substantial costs that over time eat away the potential full gains of your investments. If the costs of your fund averaged at  2% a year, meaning your average annualized rate is 6%, your $1000 gives you $5743.49, barely 5.5 fold. You lose almost half your potential gains from just a 2% cost! The numbers don't lie - compounding is both a wonder, and a potential curse. Always make sure that you check the costs of any ETFs or funds you buy into, and make sure they are reasonable for their service - the money you don't get is money you lose!0 comments1"
2,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 06 Mar 2019One thing to note is the fear, hope and greed cycle. We all know that stock markets go through a cyclical pattern where they reach a high and falls after. Interestingly, different phases of the stock market correlates with our emotions. When the market starts to rise, we become optimistic about it and feel good about our investments. When the market grows further, we get excited,  and we start to invest more money. As the market grows even further, we reach the thrilled phase, where everyone is buying into the market. As we reach the peak of the cycle, we experience a state of euphoria. At this phase, investors are exposed to maximum financial risk, and institutional investors start pulling out their investments and prices start to fall. Individual investors become nervous and start selling. This results in a negative sentiment and people become anxious. As the market falls further, investors fear that they might suffer lost but they don't pull out. Quickly after, investors feel desperate and want to exit from the market to look for safer options. At this phase, more people are exiting from the market and investors start panicking, as they see their returns are in negative. Investors tend to be overconfident when the market is growing high and start investing with a herd mentality. When the market is at an all-time low, investors don't realize it as an opportunity to invest. Investors should be cautious of investments and consistently rebalance their portfolio based on the market situation.0 comments1"
3,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 06 Mar 2019In my opinion, one thing that you should know before investing is to be more discerning and not listening to what your friends/family say, and instead focus on doing your own research before deciding if you should invest in this particular stock.For a start, perhaps you can look at the industry that this company belongs in. Is it in a sunset industry? Does it have future prospects? Eg: Electric Vehicles/Green Renewable Energy. Is it prone to legal clampdown eg: if you are looking to invest in companies in the US that deals with cannabis/marijuana products.You could then look at the company's specific risk. Is this company overly reliant on certain markets for its revenue stream? For instance, if the company is one that heavily depends on exports to the US for its revenue generation. Would it be more susceptible to the uncertainty brought about by the trade war compared to its competitors. Does this company have good fundamentals? Can it meet its debt obligations and is it currently making healthy and sustainable profits? These are some things that you can do research in, instead of consulting your friends for investing advice.Hope that helps!0 comments1"
4,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 07 Mar 2019For me, I think it would be understanding what you are investing in as much as possible. I really think that it is very helpful when you know the inner workings of the investments and therefore can make better predictions and forecasts. Another I think which would be quite important is also being emotionally calm, both during bullish and bearish runs. Following the herd may not be a very good idea since much of it is driven by market sentiment, which has an emotional component also. However, if you know the fundamentals of your investments, and can understand the market conditions, then i would suppose you might have a much easier time trying to make decisions during volatile periods.0 comments0"
5,"Chee Siang, Content Coordinator at Investment StabLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 07 Mar 2019You should read a lot of books  and watch a lot of interviews from those who invest successfully (think Warren Buffett).Start from basic stuff: personal finance. Pick up basic financial literacy skill first. Understand the basic.Then move on to investment: read about the different investment techniques/methodology/style used by different people and see which one applies or works best for you :)0 comments0"
