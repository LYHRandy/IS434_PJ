question,"Investments AMA SG Budget Babe Asked by AnonymousAsked on 14 Aug 2018Gold and Silver. Are precious metal commodities good to invest on? What are your thoughts?Background: I have investment on STI ETF and Stash away. To further diversify, I purchase physical silver bullion from Bullionstar.com every month. Silver keeps declining though and I don't know if I should continue my investment journey on precious metals. But I still have a level of confidence that it will do well some day as it has been money for thousands of years.1 answerAnswerBump0"
