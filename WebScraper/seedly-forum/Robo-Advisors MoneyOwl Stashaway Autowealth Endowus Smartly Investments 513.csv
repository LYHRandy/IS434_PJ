question,"Robo-Advisors MoneyOwl Stashaway Autowealth Endowus Smartly Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 11 May 2019For robo advisors, what is the total amount of assets that you are handling now and any maximum amount of invested holdings or customers?Are there any limits for number of customers or maximum amount of invested holdings (aggregated across all investors) that can be accepted? (As it seems like some use funds rather than ETFs or bonds as the underlying assets and the number of advisors/support appear to be very little.)1 answerAnswerBump0"

WonderkidAnswered on 18 Sep 2019I don't work at any of the roboadvisors/digital wealth management platforms but have attended enough meetups where the StashAway or Endowus teams answer these questions when people ask. It's usually confidential and something they can't disclose because it's private business information that could be sensitive for their clients and also poses competitor analysis risk.0 comments2"
