1,"Loo Cheng Chuan, Founder at 1M65 MovementLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Nov 2018I have always advocated 1M65 as the baseline. This should give a guide for a comfortable living. Outside of CPF, it depends. Professionals will give a guide of 70% of last drawn pay. For me, however, there is no hard and fast rule. We cannot give a guide, but minimally I will advocate 1M65.0 comments2"
