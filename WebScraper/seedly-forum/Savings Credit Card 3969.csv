1,"Jennifer FranslayLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 19 Sep 2019This one might be a little unethical, but Netflix in Turkey is way cheaper so I use a VPN and sign up for Netflix from Turkey :p Paying about S$7.40/mth for the standard plan (Singapore is $13.98/mth I believe)7 comments9"

Grand MasterUpdated on 19 Sep 2019The MCO crypto debit card gives you 100% back for the Netflix premium, but it's not worth it in my opinion because of the hassle to buy crypto to change into SGD to pay for things.Other than this ""hack"" which is not desirable to most, but loved by crypto lovers, no other Netflix hacks I can think of.If you have siblings, you can have 1 account and choose multiple screens, then you can split the account to share with your siblings (or close friends). Will be cheaper than having 2 or 3 accounts.4 comments4"
4,"See all 4 comments Eddie Tan19 Sep 2019Yup i choose the Netflix premium at $16.98 per month. It allows up to 4 simultaneous screens. Then you can create 4 profiles inside this ""family"" plan and share with your close friends or family members. I usually collect 3 or 6 mths upfront.Cedric Jamie Soh19 Sep 2019I agree... now for some sweet upvotes :P"
