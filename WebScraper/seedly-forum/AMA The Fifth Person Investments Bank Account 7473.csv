FreshieAnswered on 21 Feb 2019It was a good decision taking out from your FD because if you do understand how the banks makes money, you just took out a big chuck of leverage for them for your own benefit. The only question is how can you take turn your leverage into your advantage? how do you find the opportunities? Using yours as a case study, If you have $50,000 at your disposable, first split it up into the jars. Look up T.Harv Eker 6 Jar System. One of the Jars if known as the FFA, where the funds inside here are used to grow your assest. So to grow you assest, there are many vehicles in the market. Becareful though. One of the other jar is education, take 10% and go learn strategies and trainings to improve your financial decisions. So for me, one of my vehicles is trading in the market where I only risk 1% everyday of my initial deposit. Based on our own trading stratgies and data analaysis for years, its a winning rate of 83% growth non-accumalative... Meanining if I take out the profit every month, in a year's time, I would have made an average profit of 83% monthly in that year. Cumlative, if you leave your money in and adjust the 1% every month, its abut 200-300%. T Harv Eker is having his event in March 15-17 2019 @ Singapore Expo.
