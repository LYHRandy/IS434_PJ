3,"Yap ZLLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 18 Jun 20183D Printing. It will be made easily accessible to consumers. Cheap printers, not so cheap consumables... sounds familiar?Autonomous vehicles and machines. No only we will say goodbye to jobs of Uber/Grab drivers, bus drivers etc.; drones will be replacing postmen and delivery men. Military industry is already evolving in this direction. Is your child still dreaming of becoming a fighter pilot?Wearable technology. One day, our smartphones will be become obsolete, what will replace them is much more complex than just smartwatches or those clunky goggles.

WonderkidAnswered on 18 Jun 2018There are many mega trends that have been widely speculated to become pervasive in time to come, such as IoT, Big Data, Blockchain, 3D Printing & Cashless Payments.​I'd like to zoom in on one; Artificial Intelligence. Some prime examples that come to mind include:​Alexa. You can read about how smart it is becoming here: https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611216/yes-alexa-is-recording-mundane-details-of-your-life-and-its-creepy-as-hell/​OpenAI by Elon Musk. This example hits close to home. OpenAI is responsible for creating a DotA AI Bot that leveraged deep learning and it's artificial neural network to defeat real, professional players in 1v1 matches. As someone who has played DotA for a decade, this is truly astounding.https://blog.openai.com/dota-2/​Recently, Goldman Sachs used AI to predict the 2018 World Cup results. Cool stuff.https://www.businesstoday.in/trending/world/goldman-sachs-ai-predict-fifa-world-cup-2018-winner/story/279049.html0 comments0"

In no random order, largely tech based:In 5 years: AI, ML, Blockchain (infancy)In 10 years: Distributed companies and income generation, real applications of Blockchain and Crypto at scaleIn 20 years: Clean cars, Driverless cars and Space technology (real use cases), GenomicsAlso these are the things which I personally have interest in, but most likely will happen also! Just a matter of time. If humans can think of it, it will most likely happen.0 comments0"
