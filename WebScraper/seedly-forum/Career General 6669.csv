question,"Career General Asked by Lok Yang TengAsked on 07 Sep 2018Does looks matter in a career?One study reportedly found that a worker who ranked among the bottom one-seventh in looks (in the judgment of random observers) earned 10-15% less per year than someone who's attractiveness was considered to be in the top one-third. That amounted to a typical lifetime difference of about $230,000. What are your views?8 answersAnswerBump2"

1,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 07 Sep 2018The data shows it is true.The reality is that most positions that requires pretty girl / handsome face show that it is true.Even when we go interview, we were also judge for appearance. I've heard colleagues shared that the bosses also favour the pretty one more and give more leeway and chances when made mistake. Another studies also said that Woman in general of same educations / experience earns lessor than man. Not to forget the top 1/3 though may earns 10 - 15% more, they also get more nonsense and problems / issue / trouble brings about because of their attractiveness. At least we're fortunate to be in SG where we operate more by meritocracy rather than skin colours, looks etc. ​​Since typically we won't change out looks , although we can. But I believe that skils, characters, attitute plays the most part of it after the initial glamours and only the one with skills / knowledge and talents stays long and evergreen regardless of looks.​IMO, I still believe, work smart and hard enables to progress much better and further than just looks :) ​0 comments2"

That is why  we have the phrase : never judge a book by its cover. But the fact is people judge simply based on looks and come with up their own conclusions. 0 comments1"
4,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Sep 2018I think that looks do matter, in terms of first impression. Whether you like it or not, people will judge your first appearance unconsciously. So if you look good, you're probably going to score more points in terms of first impression!0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 07 Sep 2018We are all visual creatures and naturally we will be more inclined to be drawn to people and things that are of interest. ​Grooming helps as well ​I would say say yes it matters but no it’s not the only factor. ​If you have a personality, prove your value then you become a trusted advisor and others will appreciate you for who you are and what you represent regardless of looks. 0 comments1"
6,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 07 Sep 2018There was another study which also found that you create your first impression in the first 4 to 7 seconds of meeting someone.​So within that first few seconds, either you look splendid, sound splendid or simply resonate positiveness and radiance that will capture and create a solid first impression. (from executive image below)​​​All these generally help when going for an interview and also along the way, building up your overall profile along the way? Not to look overly scrappy but also decent as a whole.​I think what matters more (tbh) is if you have the 'liao' in chinese means 'capability'. If you don't have that, then I believe no matter how good you look, your true substance will show in the longer term game? 0 comments1"
