Besides the down side of No nights / weekend and unstable income during off peak (school holiday ) period, no CPF contributions. the $ is quite good. ​Suggest that maybe you can do a few other things:Save the hard earn $ to SSB (Check out Seedly blogpost on SSB)Learn to invest like the rest in Seedly.Think of what you do best / like the most, google the ads online and see what others offers, what customer complain about, focus on those weaknesses to make it the strength of your business as side gig. Continue to invest of what you have earned and save in other tools, read more seedly post and attend financial workshop.Top up some in CPF SA for retirement.Save some to wait will you're 35 or if you're already 35, apply HDB 3 room with Single scheme or if attached, proceed the usual BTO (after married to avoid any concern of deposit forfeiture)  so that you always have a roof over your head when old and can rent out room when you get the HDB to pay for the HDB installment and when old as part of passive income. ​Hope it helps!

2,"Christopher HowLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 31 Jul 2018Being an educator is not a simple task and I applaud you for being in this occupation.​Ultimately, being a full time tutor is no different than being a full time Grab driver. You are exchanging your time for money. The day you stop tutoring will be the day you stop earning income.​In the long run, how are you doing to grow your income?​Are you going to set up shop and run more classes? Are you going to hire other tutors to do the tutoring?​If you don't have a vision of how this is going to work out in the long run, I suggest you go back to the drawing board and make a more detailed plan.0 comments1"

My advise is that if you are working on a 40 day week tutoring, you should be earning about $6,000 (for it to be ideal(, must factor in ownself need to give CPF contribution0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 21 Sep 2018I think you should focus on having small groups of tution this way there will always be a pool of students and even when there are cancellations you wouldn’t be that affected ​I think it’s totally possible to run such a business. ​You would also have to put your income to go use and make it work harder in terms of investments​since there is no CPF contribution you might want to TOP up on your own early to meet the min retirement sum 0 comments0"
5,Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Sep 2018It is viable in the short term but not long term. This is because it is very competitive and you are facing a lot of competition from local tutors and foreign tutors. Hence you need to be very established in order to have a more stable income. Not forgetting you are self employed and need to contribute to your own Medisave. Just my humble opinion. 0 comments0
