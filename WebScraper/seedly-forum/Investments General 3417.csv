1,"Charmaine Ng, The Code Breaker at @ Every Chye Peng StallLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018For me I'd be topping cash into the CPF for the compound interest rates to work its magic through the years.​To put it bluntly; look, we're already in the race since we started work and with CPF being used for Housing, education and at a interest rates that is much more higher than our local banks..(let's not forget the bonus 1% for first 20K under OA etc.), it makes sense that we utilize the higher interest rates (with our government no less - who has one of the top credit rating worldwide).​That said, there are always people who says that you could invest in other instruments and get back to 8-15% returns - but those are non-guaranteed and has much higher risk. For every investment there comes a risk but the CPF is one that a lower risk while still giving a decent amount of interest rates without me having to meddle too much with it. 0 comments1"

WizardAnswered on 15 Sep 2018Tax rebate -  Check out IRAS website and your own tax bill and make it an Excel with one item that is CPF SA a/c top up for yourself,  spouse or your parents. compounding interest that is ”risk free” on SA 4%. This is good because it's risk free (since by CPF , government ), guaranteed 4%. ​I'll use it for the sake of the above 2 reason and mainly #2 so that when retire have enough $ back monthly. ​Go CPF website sign up their newsletter, they have roadshow all the time in neighbour centre so you can go ask them more questions and attend their talk to find out more. 0 comments0"

4,"Luke Ho, Venture Capitalist at CFXLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 31 Aug 2018To correct Hariz a little bit - the benefits are level and non-guaranteed returns pegged to historical core inflation in Singapore. (Our 40 yeyar track record is 2.6% while our current level is about 2%, slightly less). ​CPF OA givs you 2.5% and SA gives you 4% (as of 2018). Each one is given 1% additional for the first $20K OA and first $40K SA, bringing it up to 3.5% and 5%, typically in a lifetime about 4.11% guaranteed for SA (from age 30). It's a pretty sick deal that's not likely to change anytime soon, and the only reason I said non-guaranteed is to be specific - CPF rates used to be much higher when inflation was much higher, and the Singapore government is tied for the highest credit rating in the entire world. ​People dislike it due to its inflexibility, but the truth is that it's really a matter of proper financial planning. You can use your OA for housing, education, investing - a variety of other personal benefits, while your SA chugs along compounding year after year at a decent 4% level rate before as Hariz ssaid - becoming completely liquid after 55 once your Full Retirement Sum has been set aside. ​This Full Retirement Sum differs from age to age. ​Hope that helps. 0 comments0"
