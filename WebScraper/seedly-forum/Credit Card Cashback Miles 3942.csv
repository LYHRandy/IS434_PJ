God of WisdomUpdated on 30 Aug 2019You don't have to fly frequently to get a miles card. If you get a card whereby the miles don't expire, you can slowly build up your stash of miles for a good redemption. However, if you are not the sort to maximise category spending or find that you don't really have aspirations to fly in premium cabins, then perhaps a cash back card might suit you better, just make sure you waive the annual fee.3 comments7"

Amex KF cards transfer your miles directly to your KF account and the 3 year expiry starts ticking. This can be worrying if you don't earn enough miles to do an aspirational redemption, and you are forced to either let the miles expire, or redeem for economy.Leong Wen Fong30 Aug 2019I see, thanks so much!"
