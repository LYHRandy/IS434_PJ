Personal accident is good to have too, as the elderly are more vulnerable to falls and accidents.And then term insurance on your own life so they still have money to live on should anything happen to you.Disability income / income-replacement is also a good one only if you still have budget left.0 comments0"

Term insurance for death, critical illness and hospitalization plan for medical conditions and disability income for when you are disabled and unable to work.0 comments0"
