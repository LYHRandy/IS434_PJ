1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019For me it's the security guard whom I meet everyday... He always looks so fierce, but I think it could be a vicious cycle:He feels under appreciated (invisible)He has to scold people (even residents) and make his voice heardPeople treat him badlyHe feels even more under appreciatedJust a random thought. Next time I see him, I'm planning to buy him a Putu Piring. To brighten his day. Let's see how that goes :) will update on this story when it happens. 4 comments7"

3,"Leong Wen Fong, Economics and Management at University of LondonLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 09 Oct 2018I think policemen can be fairly under appreciated. There are those who genuinely join the force because they want to protect the law an dorder of the country, but soemtimes they are seen as being inflexible, or ""ruining the fun"". ​To be the one that breaks the party can be a real bummer, and I'm sur ethey would love to have everyone having fun, but the law that they enforce and help to keep also plays a part in the everyday security of Singapore.​Sometimes it's the black sheep amongst a community or a profession that dirties the flock.0 comments2"
