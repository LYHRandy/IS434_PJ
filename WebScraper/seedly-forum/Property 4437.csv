We chose not to go with an exclusive agent. :) I think it varies across, but I think exclusivity comes with time, so maybe if we keep using a same agent and trust builds up, we may be keen for exclusivity. But if it's a one off transaction of a much larger sum (ie a sale of a private landed), I think multiplie agents could work in your favour better :D0 comments0"

Unless agent can offer something that u find worth in exchange (eg. Much lower comm). Exclusive for much shorter time period perhaps say 1month, if u are satisfied with the number of real viewers/enquires, u can renew the exclusive with the agent.0 comments0"
