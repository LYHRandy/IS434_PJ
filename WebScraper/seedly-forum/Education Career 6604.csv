1,"Leong Wen Fong, Economics and Management at University of LondonLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Nov 2018There are many around, you just got to take time to search and apply. Hard to advise you where to go unless you know what part of Finance you want to do. Accounting? Audit? Wealth management? Finance has many aspects to it, you have to decide what you want to learn, and when you get interviewed for the internship, ask the employer if these are some of the skill you can pick up during the intership, then decide from there.0 comments1"
