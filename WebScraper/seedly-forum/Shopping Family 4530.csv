Grand MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2019Pawnshops give very bad rates for diamonds and bad rates for jewellery.You might be better off on carousell.Visit 2 or 3 pawn shops, get a few different prices, and go carousell or gumtree and set a higher price. Unless you urgently need the money.You can go female forum like https://petalbytes.com and post your diamond ring too, some savvy ladies may be keen on getting the diamond to remake into a piece of jewellery.0 comments1"
