question,"Investments Fresh Graduates STI ETF Stashaway REITs ETF Savings Singapore Saving Bonds (SSB) Robo-Advisors Regular Shares Savings Plans (RSS) Asked by AnonymousAsked on 13 Aug 2019What should I invest in, aside from STI ETF?Hi! I currently have invested $5000 in SSB and have a $100 RSP for STI ETF. I estimate around $1050 for expenses each month and was thinking of investing around $300/mth with my current salary. What would you recommend for me to invest in, with the extra $200 more per month?Feel free to let me know if $200/mth is too little, and I should consider lump sum investments too. New to investing, and won't have time for active trading or market monitoring.2 answersAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 13 Aug 2019I'd suggest skipping the STI ETF and going straight for a globally diversified portfolio through a financial advisor either digitally through a Robo or through a human advisor.This would allow you to not worry about managing your investments as you can just up a Regular Savings Plan and automatically invest monthly.0 comments3"
