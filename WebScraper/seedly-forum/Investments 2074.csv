2,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Mar 2019Hello! Perhaps you can look into putting your money into fixed deposits since it is rather liquid and you can take out the money when you need it.You can also look into P2P platforms, however thes platforms are likely to carry higher risks as compared to putting the money into fixed deposits.Another investment option would be to put the money into the Singapore savings bond. This investment option is also rather liquid. Also, SSB is likely to have a higher interest rate as compared to fixed deposits.Hope this helps !0 comments0"
