1,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 11 Mar 2019Hello! There is no definite answer to this question since whether or not a debt ratio is good is highly dependent on the context that it is being analysed in, such as the industry that the company is in.However, i personally feel that a rough gauge of a good debt ratio would be between 0.3 and 0.6. Hope this helps!0 comments0"
