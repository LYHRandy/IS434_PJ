1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019There are a set of questionnaires available that you can go through.I suggest opening an account using a Robo Advisor just to go through the process and see their recommendation. You don't have to fund your account and start investing of course. Just see which level of risk portfolio would they think suit you.2 comments2"
