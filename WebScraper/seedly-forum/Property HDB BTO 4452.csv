question,Property HDB BTO Asked by AnonymousAsked on 14 Nov 2018My girlfriend's parents are offering to pay the downpayment of a private condo for us to have a place to stay immediately as compared to BTO. Will this affect our chances of BTO in the future?I feel strongly that we should not give up on getting a BTO because of its affordable prices and potential gains. What do you think?3 answersAnswerBump0

1,"Yiyang ChenLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 14 Nov 2018if the private condo is in a good location with 999-year lease/ freehold, private condo will definitely beat BTO in terms of capital gain. There is no limit to how expensive private condos can go but government will always curb government housing prices. 0 comments1"
2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Nov 2018If the intention is to get a private condo, do it after getting the bto and not before. Unfortunately this will entail a waiting time of a few years as the bto needs to be built. And I believe you can't own a condo under your own name during the 5 year MOP period. One other way is to consider an EC. Still a waiting time for it to be built, but it'll upgrade to private condo status in 10 years 0 comments0"
