1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Apr 2019Hey there! Personally I really liked this show. Felt it was more insightful into the perspectives of short sellers rather than The Big Short- which simply covered the 2008 Financial Crisis. Not to discount the Big Short was a well produced informative show based of real life characters, the China Hustle goes a different direction more towards a documentary esque style following a few notable short sellers in their work across multiple cases. Summary: The China Hustle focuses on the perspectives and work of Short Sellers- the side investors usually dont commonly interact with. Similar to insurance agents, they are not well liked by others- particularly most of the finance industry. To quote one of them ""Nobody likes it when we are right"". In general people only want to see the stock market flourishing. Rarely do people actually benefit from short selling which is why their work is often unnoticed and disliked.For the most part, the show proceeds on to focus on the influx of China companies that have been IPOing in the US stock markets, going mostly through IB listing firms whom capitalize on investor interest, earning millions off listing shoddy shell companies, cheating plenty of retail investors. Sadly due to poor regulations and laws between overseas stock listings, China does not exactly regulate these cases and US bodies are limited in ability to step in as international law and redtape forbids them from prosecuting these frauds.Dan and his other companions- goes  to approach US SEC and the Whitehouse commissions to raise awareness regarding the existing regulatory gap that these shell scams have been abusing, but is sadly turned down in his repeated attempts. Today, I am not exactly sure how much of things have improved since then(late 2017, early 2018). Has US regulatory body caught on and improved? I am not sure. However I believe it is still a good and relevant show to catch, allowing investors to be more skeptical of investing in overseas companies listings even in well established stock markets like the US.Another notable inspirational moment came towards the end when one of the main characters- Dan David, reveals his backstory, coming from a less privileged family and despite being academically untalented with GPA of 2.0, he managed to enter the competitive finance industry and succeed in his own right. Seeing his passion and drive for his work really motivates me.0 comments0"
