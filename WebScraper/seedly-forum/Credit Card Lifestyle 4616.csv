Grand MasterAnswered 3w agoThe consolidated bill is something I love a lot (confession: I haven't had time to get down to set it yet)It's like a credit card, even without the credit card points, you love the fact you can pay everything at 1 go once a month. (and no fees incurred if you pay up on time)For a household, there are tons of bills to pay every month, electricity, water, internet, mobile telcos, Netflix (or something else) etc etc etc1 bill is for the great convenient!0 comments0"
