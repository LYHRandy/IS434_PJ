Unless you are a high income earner, I suggest that you focus on getting yourself well covered first.Another form of insurance you may consider is disability insurance like eldershield or the upcoming careshield.The main rationale for purchasing or helping them pay for eldershield and hospital insurance is such that it doesn't put a strain on your finances in the future should something were to happen to them.You may drop me an email at Brandan.chen@manulife.com.sg should you have further questions0 comments0"
