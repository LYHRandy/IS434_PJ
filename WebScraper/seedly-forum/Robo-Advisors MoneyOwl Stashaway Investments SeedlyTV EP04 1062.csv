Definitely if you are looking at robos, take a longer term view. It's currently only 3 months since you put in your investment!0 comments1"

Thus, adopt a long term mindset and ensure that the risk level that you've chosen is the right one where you are able to sleep in peace at night. Keep doing what you do, i.e. dollar cost average every month where you'll purchase more units when the price drops! Generally and eventually, the market would rise in the long run.0 comments1"

With dollar cost averaging over a long term, you will come out with better returns. The robo will also assist with rebalancing of portfolio to ensure your allocation is balanced.So, don't panic, keep investing.0 comments0"
