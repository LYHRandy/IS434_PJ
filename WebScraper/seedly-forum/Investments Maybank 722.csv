question,"Investments Maybank Asked by AnonymousAsked on 04 Aug 2019Maybank KE no longer has MIP?Hi all, I have about $2000 inside my Maybank KE account. However, they've stopped the MIP recently. Any advice on what I should do with the money inside? Should I just leave it there? Will it compound by itself or will the dividends be transferred to my trust balance and I must manually call to buy the units? Iâ€™m buying STI ETF currently. I've started using other instruments like StashAway and POSB MIP so am wondering if I should just withdraw the money in my Maybank KE and invest elsewhere.1 answerAnswerBump0"

If the latter, you can still use the money to buy the STI if you want to. Just that it the comm rate will be based on the prefunded account structure and not the MIP one.If in holdings the dividends generated will flow into your prefunded account. Which you can use to reinvest into other holdings or do a withdrawal. You can do so via app or online without calling your broker to transact; you'll save quite a bit in comms this way. I'm a tad upset about MIP being discontinued. Especially so when there is no other viable alternative available. Hopefully MIP will be offered again in the future.0 comments0"
