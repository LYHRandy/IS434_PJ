1,"Steph YeoLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 19 Jun 2018Model Answer: Divide according to the 20/50/30 rule and invest the 30% depending on my risk appetite.​Honest Answer: I'd imagine my choices might be quite different depending on the stage of life I'm at, e.g. preparing for wedding/house/kids, and how many dependents I have.​Right now as a working adult earning way less and not exactly preparing for anything, if I have that 6.5k monthly I'll first tap on my 50% spending basket and go sign up for a Ritual gym membership--that place is lit. Then I'll give serious thought into furthering my studies, tapping on the 30% investment basket as this is investing in myself. This is assuming that my work-life balance remains at my current level so I have sufficient time to work, study and rest. ​What I won't do:1) splurge on expensive bags/clothes/jewellery2) visit expensive restaurants often3) announce my pay rise to everybody4) gamble​0 comments4"
2,Sandy ChamLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 19 Jun 2018I would likely first track my expenses using seedly. From there I would have a better picture of my expenditure and how much I can save. Dividing up your expenses into discretionary and non discretionary helps as well. The savings can be used in an emergency fund or used to generate passive income. 0 comments3
3,James YeoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 27 Jun 2018I think it's a pretty decent salary but the same time applies. Pay yourself first.Check where you are from retirement and are you working towards that goal. Having a monthly 3k upon retirement for 30 years requires you to have more than 1.2 million.That sort of pushed me forward and not to lose sight of my end goal.0 comments1
