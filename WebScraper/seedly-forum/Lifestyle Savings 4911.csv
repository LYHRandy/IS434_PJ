RookieAnswered on 25 Mar 2019Undoubtedly this is based on many factors such as how much you are earning (assuming that minimally, you need to cover your own food and transport expenses). You mentioned not having savings after working for a year, perhaps is this because of your present spending or other circumstances such as student or family loans to pay-off?Without being privy to details, as a rough guide I'd recommend setting aside the bare minimum amount for food and transport (say about 50%? though this really depends on your take-home pay) and saving the rest in a fixed account. When you have a stable enough pool of savings you can also look into suitable investments to grow your money.In the meantime, perhaps scour out good hawker deals or for the more health-conscious, making DIY salads instead of purchasing ready to go ones that come with a much heftier price tag. The occasional social gathering also weighs on the wallet and I recommend limiting such outings to x number of times per quarter or year. Instead, find a friend to take part in low-cost entertainment activities. I strongly recommend documenting all expenses too! Speaking from personal experience, sometimes a cumulation of seemingly small-ticket non-essentials can snowball into a significant amount. Together with documenting expenses a savings goal also goes a long way and you can consider roping in a trusted friend or relative to keep you on track with these goals. As a millennial myself I understand that saving isn't easy but documenting and categorising your expenses can go a long way, all the best:)0 comments2"

WizardAnswered on 23 Mar 2019If you have been working for a year and still have no savings as you say, the first thing is to evaluate what you are spending on each month, because currently you are spending all of what you earn. Track your monthly expenses to get a good sense of how much is spent on essentials vs non-essentialsEstablishing a savings goal could motivate you to save $x each month Cut back on non-essentials, or earn more income such that you get to save your target each month, and put that into a high interest rate savings account to watch it grow.Jiayou!0 comments2"

You can follow this formula 50/30/20 budgeting!50% goes to your “Essentials” like Bills, loans, food, parent support, etc...30% goes to yout “Personal” expenses like shopping, travelling, entertainmen, etc...20% goes to two funds - emergency and future funds. Emergency fun can be like $50/mth then for future funds is for your retirement, wedding, children education, etc..Its good to buy savings from insurance company as they usually offer higher interest rate compared to banks, if you don‘t wish to manage them at all! I hope this helps ya!0 comments2"

Then maybe start with $30/week savings and put your spare change/coins into a piggy bank. Every month when your salary comes in, add $100 to your savings pool. Save in a high interest rate savings account. Any amount saved is a good start.0 comments1"
5,"Thanh DatLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 06 May 2019Hi members,For myself since 2012 I put aside $100 every month..after one year I increased the amount to $200. Is automatically deducted from my paycheck..to date. So before I get to spend it. The amount was already deducted. It accumulated $11650. This is a No touch zone savings. On top of this No touch zone savings.. I'm still savings. You are still young at 24yo. You can do it.If you can follow this..time will help you see your amounts growing as you age.Your paycheck play a part but no Matter how big or small you earn..if you don't focus..you will be unable to do it.
