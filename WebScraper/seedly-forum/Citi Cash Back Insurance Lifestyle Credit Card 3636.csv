God of WisdomAnswered 3w agoHi Anon, under  https://www.citibank.com.sg/global_docs/pdf/Cash-Back-FAQ.pdf  insurance (2 vi) and Grabpay (2 x) are specifically excluded from computation for the bonus cash back, but you should be able to get the 0.25% cashback on all other 'retail spend'. Having said that, most insurers only allow initial premium payment by Credit Card, so do take note.I'm not a cashback person, so this is based on my understanding of the T&Cs. The term 'retail spend' is a little vague though.0 comments6"
