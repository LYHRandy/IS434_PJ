The business is legitimate.  I've been using it for over a year and it allows me to adjust risk profile, check monthly statement , check goals, check performance and make withdrawal anytime.  0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018Hi~ Yes, it's a legitimate app to use for setting up portfolio  and I've been trying it out for say 6months at least? So far it's well catered to my risk appetited and I'm at +3%. There are many reviews for the stashaway app which you can refer to under product review section; but as a new user to investment I find that it was really intuitive and easy to understand.​No big terms, no big initial lump sum investment. Choose your risk appetite, your comfortable range of investment and know how the basket is distributed. That said, deposit and withdrawslas are flexible; giving me peace of mind.0 comments0"
