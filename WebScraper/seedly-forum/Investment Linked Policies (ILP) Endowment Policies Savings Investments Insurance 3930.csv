question,"Investment Linked Policies (ILP) Endowment Policies Savings Investments Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 10 Mar 2019What alternatives are there to traditional wealth accumulation products such as Endowment/ILP distributed by insurers? As an agent, to be able to sell a product, I have to convince myself that a product has to provide optimal benefits before I am able to sell it. And I believe that there are a few platforms that are a better fit for clients. Would love to hear your feedback.1 answerAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 10 Mar 2019Unit Trusts, ETF, Stocks, Bonds, Robo Advisors using UTs or ETFS. If you can't distribute some of the above, take your relevant M8, M8A, M6, M6A papers and partner with iFast, Navigator, FAME, and some Robos that are opening up distribution channels as well.0 comments0"
