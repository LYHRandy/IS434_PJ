1,"Zen Rogue XuanLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 27 Jun 2019 Premium holiday:  you  may  temporarily  suspend  your  regular  premium  payments  by  applying for a premium holiday after the Minimum Contribution Period, as long as the value of the Accumulation Units Account of the policy is sufficient to cover the relevant policy charges due. With no premium contribution during premium holiday, the account value of your Pulsar II policy will be significantly reduced due to fees and charges, which are still deductible during premium holiday, and your entitlement to loyalty bonuses may also be affected.   So basically after paying your premiums for a certain period of time, you can exercise the option to stop paying premiums. However, fees and charges will continue to apply, so what AXA will do is to sell the units you bought to service the premiums. In this manner, the value of your AXA Pulsar plan will fall signifcantly, and you may not get the loyalty bonuses too.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 15 May 2019It is not wise to do premium holiday for most ILPs, at least until 10 years have passed. For details, require the product summary and fees to really look into it.0 comments0"
3,HOHazel OngLevel 1. FreshieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I’m not sure about pulsar per se but premium holiday usually means you stop paying premiums but your coverage is still there by using the cash values of the plan to sustain provided it’s sufficient to last till you need it to.1 comment0
4,"PZPeh Zhun Sen06 May 2019Hi I have a pulsar policy as well, I think you can only exercise the premium holiday option after the first 18mths of paying your regular premiums. In any way, it works by allowing you to stop paying premiums up to a max of 10 yrs if I remember correctly. But because of that, your account value will continue to face the policy account maintainenance fee and  policy fee charges, resulting in a decrease in value for your accumulated sum in pulsar untill u decide to resume regular premium payments."
