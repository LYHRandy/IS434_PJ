1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 20 Mar 2019As I mentioned in another post, I don't have much knowledge in this area so I will just share some information that I collected.Business Segments: KIT business segments include distribution & network. On asset allocation, Distritbution & Network represents 53%, energy 28% and water & waste 19%.Financials: Group revnue was $637.4mn, 0.8% higher than the previous year, due to higher contributions from City Gas due to higher fuel prices. This had actually been offset by some service outages in Basslink casued by a third partcy ontractor. Overall distributable cashflows decreased by $3mn, Net Asset value dropped to 27.3 cents and gearing ratio increased to 40.3%. DPU remained the same as the previous year. Based on recorded financials, there doesn't seem to be anything exciting here.Growth Strategies: There are 3 different forms of growth strategies that they are tyring to adopt. Organic growth from existing portfolio, synergy within Keppel group and acquisitions. Organic growth potential doesn't seem too bad based on the figures relating to City Gas, less the incidents which occured from May to June. For Synergy within Keppel, they are looking at Bridge Financing and Co-investment opportunities among the numerous opportunities they are looking at. For acqusitions, they seem to look at more stable, mature businesses with defensible business value propositions. Risks associated with Unforseen Circumstances: There were quite a few hiccups over the past few years, where there have been some issues where facilities needed to be taken out of service. This has actually affected their financial performance and they have been highlighted even during the investor's presentations.0 comments1"
