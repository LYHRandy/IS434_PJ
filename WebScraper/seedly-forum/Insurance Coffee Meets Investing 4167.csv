1,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 10 Jul 2018Hi there! I guess you may be refering to this image here:​​​​Let me explain further:The orange component is actually the term life component (which is around 300k) hence also known as 3xThe blue part is actually the whole life component (which is around 100k)The focus as you can see is between 25 to 65 years old. Most term lifes end at 65 years old. Before the premiums paid yearly starts to climb rapidly till 99 years old. This is for very obvious reasons.​The whole idea is that during that period of 40 years, you would be in the prime of your earning potential of your life. Hence if you die, your dependents or family can actually get the most payout from your death. Thus allowing them to tide over and not have any financial worries.​I must bring back the definitions which I shared on stage and have been advocating here regarding life insurance:​There are 3 types which you will need to understand in this diagram here below. I personally do not advocate ILPs as I am not a big fan of mixing insurance and investments as both serve very unique different purposes indeed.​​Hope this answers your questions!0 comments1"
