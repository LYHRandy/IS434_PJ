1,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 02 Mar 2019I will think they go hand in hand.If you increase your income but also increase your spending then you are back to square one.I see alot of people who are able to increase income rapidly but then they started spending more buying luxury goods, more exquisite holidays, cars, condo etc. Can spend abit more but keep your end goal in mind.0 comments2"
2,"Dawn FionaLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 04 Mar 2019Yes for sure!The difference is which one you have control over.You don't always get to decide that your income WILL rise (some people work very hard and keep upgrading themselves but also still no income raise), but you can have control over how much you wanna save and cut down on.Both should go hand in hand.0 comments1"
