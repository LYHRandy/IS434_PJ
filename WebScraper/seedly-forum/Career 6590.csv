1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Oct 2018Well, do you need to have work life balance in this stage of your career / life? Do you have a family / young kids to take care of? If you don't have any commitments at the moment, can consider the prospective new role since it pays better. And use this as a stepping stone to the next role with higher salary. But if you have family commitments, may be a better idea to stay put since the hours are better. 0 comments3"

4,"Bertrand Wong, Reward Specialist at Schneider ElectricLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 20 Oct 2018Hi there! If you value inclusiveness at work and don't mind working more hours, I would say it's a great opportunity that you should seriously consider. As much as you are comfortable with your current working hours (since it's not as taxing), I would highly recommend you to take that leap and expose yourself to a totally new environment because it expands your perspectives. It's not just a consideration of a pay rise that you should factor in, but also the potential learnings, exposure, and growth that you can gain in your career. All these come into play, especially when you're making a career transition. I can see that you have also done your research to find out more from the people working in that prospective company, which is good because you get to hear from them first-hand, and everyone's opinions do differ, I agree on that. But at least you have a sense of how things are like and may be like, and it's okay if it doesn't meet your expectations, but you can consider grounding yourself to specific work values that will stick with you throughout your career.Hope that helps! :)0 comments0"
5,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 17 Oct 2018Go for it. Not because of higher pay but because of better jobs satisfaction and good colleague. Job satisfaction could be due to better environment , better work life balance or better colleague. It could also be due to more job challenge in the right area and directions. This is much more important than just $ or people because it gives you good exposure and experience in the future. Which goes a long way. As Steve jobs says "" stay hungry , stay focus "". Let's strive to learn and grow more. üôÇüëç0 comments0"
6,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Oct 2018Calculate the hourly wage you will potentially receive, and compare it to your current job. Also, I think it matters whether you are more interested in your current job or in that prospective job. Would you like what you are doing daily more? Would you mind sacrificing time and hours for it? 0 comments0"
