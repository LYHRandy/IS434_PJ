WonderkidAnswered on 18 Jun 2018There are two platforms that I know you could help your children to invest in.​DollarDexYou could specify the account type to Joint or Joint-Juvenile depends on the age of your children. Dollardex is more for investing in Index Fund and etc. You can look up on it more on the website.https://www.dollardex.com/sgn/?current=investUTopen/home&previous=home ​FSMOneYou can create a beneficiary account for your children and they are able to invest in the different Asset Class on their own. You can check it out at https://secure.fundsupermart.com/fsm/account-opening/main for more information.​Hope this helps! :)​0 comments0
