MasterAnswered on 16 Apr 2019Why not do a cost benefit analysis to cancelling and putting into another investment instrument to make a better decision? What's it the yearly yield?How much did it deviate from the benefit illustration? Have you requested for a new BI?Most life plans yield sweet spot is around 70 years old to 80 years old, and the incentive to hold onto the plan is less attractive. But still, DYODD.

The context is really very important.It may not make financial sense to cancel it because you may experience losses as well as coverage.Additionally, how do you determine whether she doesn't need it or not? Did you go through a professional who can give you a second opinion? I could take a look at it.  https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
