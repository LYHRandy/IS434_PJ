MasterUpdated on 21 Apr 2019Some key differences compared to stocksPreferred SharesCompared to ordinary shares, preferred stockholders usually have no or limited, voting rightsHave a higher claim to dividends or asset distribution than common stockholders - i in the event of liquidation, preferred stockholders have seniority over common stockholders and will be paid firstPerps (Perpetual Securities)Most perpetual securities are fixed-income instruments just like bonds, paying a fixed interest rate at regular intervalsNo maturity date and the issuer has the right to never return the principal amount to you. (Like the Hyflux saga)Convertible BondsFixed-income debt security that pays interest payments but can be converted into a predetermined number of common stock or equity shares.Attractive option for investors as they often provide a win-win situation for them; ensuring seniority in the event of liquidate and capital appreciation if investors choose to convert these bonds at the end of maturity to common stocks0 comments0"
