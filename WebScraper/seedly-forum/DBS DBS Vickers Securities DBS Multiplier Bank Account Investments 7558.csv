But do note, the extra % you get for SAYE will be forfeited once you withdraw money from it. As a NSF you don't know whether will you need the cash. And you forgo the liquidity for 1% interest. Alternatively, CIMB fastsaver. 0 comments0"
2,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Sep 2018If you can meet the criteria (salary credit, minimum spending) to earn higher interest for accounts like DBS Multiplier, UOB One, OCBC 365 etc, then go ahead and get those accounts. Otherwise, can consider CIMB FastSaver (Liquid) or POSB SAYE (Not liquid - if withdraw, will forgo additional interest).0 comments0"
3,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019NS is POSB save as you serve. Not sure got diff or not. But you cannot withdraw at all once you put into the SAYS account so do remember that. Not too sure about DBS Vickers. But do remember to check the various charges.1 comment0"
