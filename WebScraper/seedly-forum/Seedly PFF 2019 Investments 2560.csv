Grand MasterAnswered on 03 Jun 2019The value of Tesla is not the number of cars, the profit per car, or etc.The value is the data.In terms of producing electric car in scale and profitable, once mercede, toyota, ford or any of the big major car player decide to do it, they wil be able to do it at a much lower costs.however, tesla has a big moat in terms of data. They have so many cars that have been driving around collecting and sending data back to HQ for analysis, they are closer to a ""Automonous Taxi fleet"" than uber or Lyft or even Grab can be.That is the golden goose.I personally believe tesla will be better because of the guy that made it happen. Elon Musk. I won't bet against him. He managed to shoot rockets to space at a friction of the cost that NASA said can't be done, Boeing said can't be done, etc etc.Tesla is the first new car brand in the past 40 years that succeed (or was it 50 yrs i can't remember the article i read)He may be eccentric and not capitalist savvy, but well, all genius are weird.Disclaimer:- I am heavily in tesla. Would have bought more, but I need my cash for my business.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 01 Mar 2019I think it comes down to how price sensitive customers of Tesla actually are.Haven't done an indepth research on the first time customer profiles of Tesla, but I strongly believe if you people buy Tesla cars, not just because its a EV but because they believe in the vision Elon Musk has, their brand value proposition of embracing innovation, clean energy, challenging the norms. All these factor into buyer decsion making and satisfaction- which I believe outweigh the difference in prices. Sure Tesla Revs might increase in coming quarters, but I dont think that difference will be significant to me as an investor.Of course, cheaper prices would make Elon's goal of replacing traditional fuelled cars to 100% EVs more attainable, but I believe its not just price thats holding back adoption especially internationally.From a fundamental perspective, I would argue nothing major has changed. Buy if you already believe in the long term fundamentals of the company, not solely from this news.0 comments0"
