1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019The max you can top up to SA is via the RSTU scheme (Retirement Sup Top Up), which is up to the Full Retirement Sum for the year. In 2019, this is $176k. So if you have 56k now, you can only top up 120k. After SA is full you can only do a Variable Contribution of $37,740 which will be split to the 3 accounts, but since SA is full, it'll flow to OA. And if MA & SA is full, it can only go to OA as well. 3 comments2"

3,"Leong Wen Fong, Community Lead at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019About a month ago we had an AMA with Mr Loo, and he did address some of these concerns.In summary, like what you said, the main promblem is that people want to enjoy the use of money NOW. Let's say I'm 25 years old. I definitely feel that I will need the money more ringht now, when I'm getting married, having kids, needing to buy a house, etc. Rather than when I'm 65, and all my kids (hopefully) can fend for themselves, and I'm just left with a bunch of cash to spare.Other than that, some people are afraid the withdrwal age will increase, change in political parties will change how CPF will work... etc.Edit: Sorry in addition to this, you can't top up 1 million straight because you can only top up a maximum of $7000 (cash) per year4 comments1"

SA you can only top up to $200K?  No? 1 comment0"
6,"Josh Ng03 Jul 2019No. The cap for SA in 2019 is $176k, but subjected to change every year. So refer to the comments made above, the voluntary top up per year is $37k. You can top up $7k or thereabout every year and do it repeatedly until your SA hits the maximum threshold set by the government. In which case, you can't do voluntary cash top up to SA anymore."
