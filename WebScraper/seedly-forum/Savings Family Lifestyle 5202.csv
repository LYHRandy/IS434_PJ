1,"Alson ChuaLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 23 Aug 2019I used to gave my mom every month $500-$800 cash and pay her phone bills and some other bills. She has a full time job and long story short, I found out that she’s not been saving up the money I gave to her and instead spending on unnecessary stuffs. Now I stop giving her the cash and instead I use the money to top up her Special Account. Calculate how much more to hit the minimum sum when she retire and top up every month accordingly. I told her  I will start to give her cash again when her CPF start paying out the monthly Retirement Sum. This way you don’t need to worry she anyhow spend and no money to retire, all burden falls on you.3 comments8"

3,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 20 Aug 2019I thought I was the only one who worries about parents spending unnecessarily! Interesting to see other people sharing the same concerns.For example, my mum deems weekly manicures and pedicures necessary O_OAs such, I look to directly pay for food (stuff in the fridge), essential toiletries like soap and shampoo, as well as big-ticket expenses like mattresses, curtains, washing machine etc.0 comments2"
4,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 15 Aug 2019I give 20% monthly of my takehome pay. (after CPF)But I don't think there should be a benchmark? You give what you can :)
I think as children, it is the simplest we can do to contribute back to our parents who brought us up.0 comments2"
5,"RxLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 15 Aug 2019About 15-20% too but I try not to give them in cash unless they specifically asked for it because they will spend it on unnecessary stuff like gambling 4D/TOTO and changing tap/door lock which is totally working fine?? etc. I would rather pay for all their shopping, grocery, insurance, bills and meals.0 comments2"
6,"Ck ChaiLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 15 Aug 2019The allowance for my parents is split into few portions:I credit a fixed allowance of $150 per month for offsetting some giro deduction expenses and give cash as & when needed.I pay for the grocery purchases made with the supplementary credit cardI pay for the internet + mobile lines + insurance instalmentsGenerally $600 - $800 per month, which is approx 20 - 25%?Depending on individual's income and expenses, someone's 10% maybe equivalent to your 20% or vice versa, so it's really hard to judge, based on a  percentage against your salary or an amount, if it's an acceptable amount to give. Also, some parents spend less and some spend more, do they spend more on needs or want? How much is enough? It's hard to define.I feel that most importantly, you need to be comfortable with the amount to give and try cover your parents' basic expenses or at least major expenses? You can do some simple calculation to work out your expenses and maybe talk to your parents to know how much allowance they would like to have, and see if it's within your means/budget. Should you have problem giving the amount they prefer, communicate and I believe they will understand.0 comments2"

MasterUpdated on 15 Aug 2019I gave my parents 15%, because I am their retirement plan sadly.Can't negotiate less. But if you can we encourage to give about 10% of take home pay. That is easy and not taxing on your own savings and investment.0 comments0"
