Bascially 2 things:1) Wear and tear. Our credit card is actually quite complicated, holding a lot of information. But as time pass and with frequent use, the card itself will spoil as they are not built to last forever. Expiry date gives the bank a chance to give you a new card. Your credit card account remains active.2) Prevent fraud. I think it is rather self explanatory for this.0 comments2"
