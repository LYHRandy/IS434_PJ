question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 26 Aug 2019What are your thoughts on insurance products replacements?If we advise clients to replace my term life plan and critical illness plans yearly as the company updated the product and offer more discounts, is this considered churning? We still are rewarded with incentive trips and sales incentives. I do realise some of the other agencies would only get 10% of commission for replacements and servicing.1 answerAnswerBump0"

It's never smart to replace an insurance policy. Discounts have to be huge to cover a year's worth of premiums paid already. Cost of insurance will increase no matter what.0 comments2"
