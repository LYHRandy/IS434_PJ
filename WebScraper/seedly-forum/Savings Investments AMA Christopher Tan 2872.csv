MasterUpdated on 21 Jan 2019Even though im not Christopher but ill put some of my thoughts as well.You should first learn more about investment because there are a lot of things you can invest in such as stocks, bonds, CPF, commodities, options, property, loans and more. Stocks itself have a lot of different styles like ETFs, value, growth, robo advisors and so on. You have to see which kind of investment suits your goal and risk appetite. You can simply start by going to Seedly blog to learn or google. Just take your time to learn first. Dont invest in things you dont understand because thats just gambling. Good luck!0 comments1"
2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Jan 2019Find out how to invest first. Read up, ask on seedly. Find out what is your risk appetite like, what is your personality when it comes to handling money or investing. Once you have this, find an investment instrument that meets your risk profile and personality and go from there. Take baby steps, learn more, rinse and repeat. It's a journey, not a race. Unless you are itching to retire now in which case you need something more supercharged (like managing options, trading futures or forex) 0 comments0"

Reading some investment books would be good too. Sgbudgetbabe has an article of some books worth reading: http://www.sgbudgetbabe.com/2017/07/recommended-books-on-personal-finance.htmlYou can also read up on investing on the various financial blogs that can be found online!You should also try to find out how your risk appetite is like. If you are risk averse, you can go for fixed deposits, SSB, etc. If not, you can look more into stocks, REITs, bonds, etc.0 comments0"
