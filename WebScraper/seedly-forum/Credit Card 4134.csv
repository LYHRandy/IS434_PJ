1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Jun 2019I always said again and again you either be team cashback or team miles, not both as you will be on the losing end.It is very hard to give a definite answer as to how much 1 mile is worth, since different people value it differently. Too many factors to consider. HC Tang gave a few suggested readings so do take a look.There are a few cards that gives more than 5% cashback. UOB YOLO, ONE Card, OCBC 365 etc.As far as I know, there is no one card that gives a flat 5% cashback across all spending categories (banks will make a loss so...) but the cards I mentioned earlier give rather high cashback for different spending categories.
