1,"Dwivid SharmaLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 31 Oct 2018Hi there,I have always recommended for REIT's stocks and in the case of Singapore. I strongly prefer to invest in real estate. Pricing of real estate is raising more frequently than anything else. That's why I suggest you invest some money in REIT's stocks. 30+ Top Singapore Real Estate Investment Trust REITs in 2018Moreover, Technologies and Telecom sector have a bright future if you are investing for 2-3 years.

2,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 31 Oct 2018Perhaps you could monitor the stocks that you want using fundamental and technical analysis. In the current market situation, stocks prices are pretty volatile. You have to do your research and be clear why you want to purchase a particular stock. 0 comments0"
3,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 31 Oct 2018It is hard for others to specifically recommend you a stock to buy since we have different risk tolerance, objetives and views (which may contradict) . Whilst it is cheaper now, it's also more volatile.For starters, you can try researching on the various companies (well-known brands such as SingTel, ShengSiong etc) in the local market first on good fundamentals/high dividend-paying/... to suit your objective. Alternatively, there are robo-advisors and ETFs if you are not adept at stocks trading yet. It's best to follow your own judgement since no one cares more about your money than you do (presumably).0 comments0"
