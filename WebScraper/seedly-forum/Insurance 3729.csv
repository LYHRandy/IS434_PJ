There are a few categories of insurance which can be cashflow insurance, which is basically protect you from the risk of unknown cashflow. In order to qualify them as cashflow insurance, basically it must either (1) protect your cashflow or (2) kicks in when your cashflow diminished. For some of these insurance, it depends on your definition instead. But for Academic purpose...(1) Disability insurance - it provides you with (a) an income (disability income insurance) when you are unable to perform more than 1 ADL (activities of Daily Living). Some has stringent criteria of (b) 3 ADLs (Total permanent disability).(2) credit card protection insurance - they protect your cashflow from diminishing due to the high interest rates(3) Trade Credit insurance -  The primary function of trade credit insurance is to protect sellers against buyers that do not or cannot pay (mainly for companies).(4) Daily hospitalisation cash benefit - It is a form of rider that pays you an allowance in the event you goes into hospital. So its also a form of cashflow(5) Cashback Endowments Plans - You pay a premium to save, and after a few years, there are cashback available for you to use as cashflow.So do let me know what do you really mean when you mention cashflow insurance, and i hope to have answered your enquiries when i list out potential insurance that may fit the category.0 comments0"
