1,"Tan YBLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 10 Jun 2018Agoda does have relatively cheaper rates most of the time but I always compare across all sites before booking. Certain times, Expedia gives a better deal. Do also note that there are different discounts depending on whether booking is through Agoda web or Agoda mobile. So do check all before making purchase!Also, do note that certain times if you use shopback to get to Agoda, may not be eligivle to use the Agoda discount codes. So ultimately check all methods before buying :)0 comments1"

WonderkidAnswered on 03 Jun 2018I'm a former casual traveler, but I have friends who travel every week and have some serious strategies as per how to travel frequently and for low cost...​It is a good-to-have to have a Shopback account for cashback - hereIt is inevitable that you need an account on ""social sharing platforms"" such as Airbnb (accomodation), Blablacar (car pooling esp for long distance), Taxify (ride-sharing)Do a quick search about what is available in Europe for travelling...Ryanair for instance is the AirAsia of EuropeIf you have Shopback ,you can shop on Agoda, Expedia, and a few other travel websites...(skyscanner, ctrip, traveloka)Pair your Shopback with RateX, which might help you find coupons and best forexHave a multi-currency account like the one available at DBSCitibank has good credit cards for Rewards and AirMiles​Hope it helpsPascal0 comments1"

It will be cheaper this way.If you're looking for really cheap accomodation, you could consider staying in a hostel? Hope it helps!0 comments0"
4,"Stephanie NgLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 13 Jun 2018I always use Shopback and Expedia. Expedia rates might sometimes lose to Booking.com but because I stick to Expedia, I have became their GOLD member which results in more Expedia points per stay. All these points can be used to pay for my next hotel booking so it's a huge win! I use SC Manhattan or Spree as they have ongoing promo code with Expedia too! 0 comments0"
5,"Xin YingLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 12 Jun 2018There's Insider rates for Agoda. I'll usually compare between Agoda, Booking.com and the hotel itself
 Sometimes it is cheaper to book directly and you have more room for negotiations (e.g., late check out) orommunication. Note though that Agoda etc may not include taxes in the discounted rate that appears. E.g., service tax However if all else is equal and you know you're likely to be travelling frequently, you can consider Agoda so as to maximize the rewards. I personally like it's interface better. So long as you remember to check the total price before you book..0 comments0"
