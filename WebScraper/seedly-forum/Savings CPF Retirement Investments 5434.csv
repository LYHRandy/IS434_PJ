God of WisdomAnswered on 16 Sep 2019Yes, I would consider CPF SA as the investment-grade bond component of my portfolio. Just note that you must be aware that you do not control the terms and conditions of this 'bond' and will be at the government's mercy (e.g. future rate changes or changes to when you can access the money). Having said that, the purpose of CPF SA is the need to provide for your retirement so 4% backed by a triple-A rating is not easy to find nowadays.0 comments4"
