As you know, whatever sum of money that was deducted from your CPF OA to pay for your house, including HDB Grants, will be repaid back into your OA with interest accrued. Since you are on the old scheme called Retirement Sum Scheme, the Full Retirement Sum(FRS) is based on the year you turned 55(https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Schemes/schemes/retirement/retirement-sum-scheme) If your RA balance is below said FRS amount, the money will enter into RA automatically and monthly payouts would increase accordingly. On the other hand, if your RA balance is above that of FRS, the money in the CPF should remain in OA and can be withdrawn anytime:)3 comments0"

As such, if you fail to meet said payout, the sum of money in CPF from the sale of the house would be added to the RA so as to increase monthly payouts. However, certain circumstances may allow the refunded OA to be withdrawn eg medical condition etc. It would be better for you to write in to CPF to ask about this:)Question Poster01 Jul 2019I totally agree"
