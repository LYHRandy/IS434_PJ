Grand MasterAnswered on 24 Apr 2019There are many ways to enjoy better interests rate via your bank accounts. Need not necessarily be through a joint savings account. I recommend a couple (engaged or married) to have a joint savings account mainly for these 3 reasons.Its a commitment towards the relationship and their futureIt helps the relationship as both parties work together towards a common goalIt helps to keep track of the family expenses and separate it from individual expensesUltimately, the joint savings account can help the relationship through behavioural finance.0 comments3"

What i found more common is that couples would each contribute a pre-determined amount into a joint savings account regularly. My wife and I are comfortable channeling our salaries into a joint account and we have managed to increase the interest rate of our savings in this manner.

They prefer Citibank Maxigain because of the higher interest rates and that the conditions are easy for them to meet.1) Maintain at least 70k
2) Do not take out the moneySince its emergency funds, they hope not to touch it.0 comments0"
