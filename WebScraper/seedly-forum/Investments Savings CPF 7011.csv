1,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 07 Nov 2018anywhere more worthwhile could be a subjective matter. CPF is not the best, but it is easily the easiest and safest tool for most. You do not need to understand anything about investment, it carries practically zero risk, and gives a high return for the kind of risk level.0 comments0"
