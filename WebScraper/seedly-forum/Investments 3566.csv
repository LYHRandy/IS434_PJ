1,"Luke HoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 06 Jul 2018Hi, really weird that nobody answered this question yet. I'm a Syariah-compliant trained financial consultant and there are funds available specifically for you available on platforms that I offer. As usual, Syariah funds follow Islamic law strictly and are vetted by a board of external scholars before approval - no violation of riba, no investments into frowned upon activities like tobacco, alcohol, etc. â€‹You can get started for as low as $100/mth, and expected returns net of fees, depending on the type of fund, can range from 4 - 8% annualized. 0 comments1"
