God of WisdomAnswered 2w agoHi, if you don't attend meetings or vote, the EGM will still go on. The EGM is to approve the actions necessary to proceed with the merger, such as the merger itself, and the issuance of the new stapled units. If you don't attend, it is considered that you abstain.0 comments2"
