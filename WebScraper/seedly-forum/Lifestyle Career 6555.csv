Honestly if I could make a side hustle out of game streaming, I would totally do it. Unfortunately, I'm so bad at it, I probably need to pay people to watch me instead of people paying me.For company policies wise, I think if its ad hoc things like helping out at events etc, or emceeing, then it shouldn't be a problem. For more stable side incomes, you have to think about the time you are putting in that hustle, and at the very least, it must not affect your main job. Other than that, you might also want to re-think the time you have sith your family etc, and even the time when you spend enjoying must drastically reduce.There is always a sacrifice to get what you want0 comments2"

God of WisdomAnswered on 14 Dec 2018I provide digital marketing services, business consultancy, sales and marketing funnel consultancy, and for the more fun stuff, I also do emceeing, sing and act when there are gigs.I'll also be co-publishing a book soon, plus I do talks regionally with a mentor of mine, on top of runnings ads and sales for my agency. Seems like a lot, but I don't have 9 to 5 so it's a little different for me. 0 comments0"
