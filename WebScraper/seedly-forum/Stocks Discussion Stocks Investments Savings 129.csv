1,"Darren ChewLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 02 Jul 2019There are no blue chip stocks that is a must buy. In fact there are several blue chip stocks are a must not buy.A good stock that is currently may no longer be good in the furute. in the 90s, SPH is a good buy as it usually move in a range and give good dividend.However, the market condition has changed, this blue chip stock has been declining Would they able to recover in the future?
I would suggest you build a diversified portfolio of fundamentally good  stocks and REITs. Rebalance it when the market condition changes.
Hope that help.0 comments7"
