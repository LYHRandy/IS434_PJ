question,"Lifestyle Family Asked by Ronald SzieAsked on 23 May 2019What malaysia prepaid simcard recommended for monthly weekend trips to JB?I am thinking of getting a prepaid card from Malaysia (mainly using data to navigate). I'm currently paying $5 for 3 day data roaming access via Starhub. Wonder there is a cheaper local option, with easy way to extend validity (in case I do not go in that often).3 answersAnswerBump1"

WizardAnswered on 23 May 2019If just using data for navigations, grabs etc, suggest try: redOne M'sia:  https://www.redone.com.my/postpaid/amazing_plan They just launch in Singapore yesterday but I think getting the M'sia postpaid plan at RM8/month for 1GB LTE /4G data is more, you can get 2 account so free calls between you and partners / family members as compare to Starhub RM15 (SGD5 x 3) for 1GB last 3 days each time. Literally you're paying SGD3 for redOne monthly vs Starhub SGD5 each time.0 comments2"

I don't have the exact numbers cause I can't really rmb but it's really cheap!What I did was I got a Digi Prepaid Sim Card (costs about 30-40rm at the shop in city square mall). Then you top up credits into your Sim card from this machine in the store, and use your phone (dial  8881if i'm not wrong) to purchase data/call time.It costs only 1rm per 100mb of data (for me 100-200mb is defo enough for google maps and google searches for 2 - 3 days), so just buy more using your mobile credits. The Sim itself expires after 3mth of inactivity, so as long as you come back to malaysia within 3 months you can use it.If you run out of credits you can always top up credits into your sim card at the digi store too, I think they have them at all the malls.5 comments2"

Grand MasterAnswered on 23 May 2019I do not travel in to JB often but I believe most prepaid sim card in JB cost more than 5 SGD. Though they provide you data without having you to eat into your own existing data. If you do not go in that often, I believe what you are doing now is fine. There isnâ€™t really much of a difference if you do not go in that often and 5SGD is really reasonable.0 comments2"
