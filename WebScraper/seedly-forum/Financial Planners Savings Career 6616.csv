Don't repeat the same thing and expecting things to change. Try a different method. Seek a different mentor or perspective. Try to step back and look at your own approach. And most importantly, be ethical.If there's no team support, start looking for alternative team/agency to join. No point sticking with something bad. Sales oriented is a myth. Anyone can do it if they try hard and smart enough.0 comments2"
2,"Wilfred Ling, Professional Fee-based Financial Planner at The IFA on DutyLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 02 Nov 2018You do not need to be 'sales oriented' to succeed.  However, by the fact that you lack team support just means your hurdle is even higher. If you are in the 'right' team, you will receive proper training. Nobody is born to know how to 'sell'. While it is not impossible to succeed without team support but why put yourself in such a position when there are many teams in Singapore that do provide support?Considering your client base is still very small, it may be better to just jump ship and get yourself into a team that can truely provide  you with such support. I am not a  recruitment manager but can give pointers on the kind team you should be looking for. Google my name on internet and you'll find my direct line.  0 comments0"

4,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 Nov 2018Do re-examine the reasons why you joined the insurance industry since you mentioned you are not sales oriented. Do think about your own values, strengths and weaknesses and see whether it is a good fit. You could seek a career counsellor for career counselling. However, nobody could answer the question (whether sales is the right line for you)  except yourself. No doubt your manager and team could make a lot of difference, but ultimately it is your passion or calling that is going to make a difference. 0 comments0"

You'll have to decide what you're more comfortable with. Also, doctors don't sell you medicine. They prescribe it to you and you jolly well take it. If not, you'll most likely get worse and instead of a pill today, he'll do your surgery next year. See, all business is just ""Traffic and Conversion"".Maybe you're just not meeting enough people. Or trying to meet people that don't feel like they need any medicine. Find people with real concerns that you can solve. Or find a problem or gap in the market and go deep into the people that would most likely have that concern or problem.If you have enough activity but not closing, it's most likely that you're not giving either good enough advice, or not getting your clients to understand why it's good or important, and they don't feel that same respect they have towards you as their doctors. Figure out the issue, and try to solve it one step at a time. 0 comments0"
