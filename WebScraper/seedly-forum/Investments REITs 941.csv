God of WisdomAnswered on 26 Jun 2019While the screeners give you an idea of the figures, to me, the best way to get the numbers is still through the annual report. Use the screener as a way of filtering out the REITs that you are interested in, but the numbers from the annual report will guide your decisions eventually.0 comments7"
