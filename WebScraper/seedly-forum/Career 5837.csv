1,"Steph YeoLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 21 Jan 2019Maybe. Would have been easier for us to share our opinions if you first explained why you feel that there are no learning opportunities and bleak future prospects.If you’re q new, say maybe less than 6 months, then I’d guess  most likely you’re too quick to judge. Maybe these opportunities are just not visible to you yet.But if these aspects of the job are important to you, and you want to find out about them as soon as possible, find somebody you can ask and share your concerns? I believe most jobs would allocate newcomers with a “buddy” to guide you through stuff like that. Otherwise HR, or your reporting officer?0 comments0"

WonderkidAnswered on 10 Jan 2019If you are employed for less than 6 months, I'd say it's too early to judge.Not sure which industry or company you're in, so it's hard to judge the culture and hierarchy.But, no matter where you are, I'm sure a good boss would love her direct reports to be proactive and always taking the initiative.If you want more learning opportunities, take up more work! Bring this up to your direct manager and tell her to give you more work or different work.After that, if you identify some parts which you feel can be better, or a new idea you would like to initiate, draft up a brief proposal and present it to your boss or your team. Keep trying this until your boss lets you run one of the ideas.There you go, be the change you want to see.0 comments0"
3,"Luke Ho, Kick-Ass Financial Services Consultant at Trillion Financial PlannersLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 02 Jan 2019It depends how long you've been at the job. On average most jobs take about 6 - 9months before you've largely adapted to the routine, about 2-3 years before you hit your primary peak (and also when most employees get bored from the lack of challenge) and 10 years for mastery. Future prospects are usually based on several factors:1) Promotion within the company - are there positions available? What is the company's history of advancing its employees? Is it entirely on merit or are there experience/years of service factors? 2) Increment factors - what kind of increments/pay bumps/bonuses/benefits/promotions are available?3) Scalability - What is the company's overall direction? (and this is the factor most employees fail to take into account). Are they trying to increase sales forever? Are they looking to get bought over? Are they going to stick to a niche market or expand overseas or what? You don't have to actively participate in it as much as simply know the direction so that when the time does come, you have an opportunity to ask for money. Then there's the inidividual factors, such as:1) On what basis do you consider there a lack of learning opportunities and what can you do about it?2) If there are future positions unavailable, would you consider competing for a position that's taken but you believe you're better suited for?3) Are you actively tracking your own individual growth? I can only assume so because it takes a LOT of confidence to suggest that isn't something new to learn in a career. And if you are, have you leveraged it to fight for better opportunities both within your company and outside it?These are just some of the things you need to ask yourself. In any case - I'm a Financial Consultant who's worked with quite a few SMEs, so I give business and financial advice. You can always nudge me on Facebook if you have any other questions. https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"

WonderkidAnswered on 01 Jan 2019It's a good 'problem' to have when you feel you have capacity or the desire to learn more / take on more responsibility than you're currently having. If that's the case, you may want to ask for it and only then are you able to know for sure if the opportunity is available to you.0 comments0"
