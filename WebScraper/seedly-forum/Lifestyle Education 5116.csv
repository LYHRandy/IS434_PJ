1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 05 Jun 2019Definitely. Even as a millenial growing up, I thought my time was stressful enough.But these days, I am hearing about tuition for pre-school (?!), too much extra-curricular activities for kids on top of school time, and sadly, increasing number of suicides over things like academics.We need to recognize that a person's self worth is so much more than academic achievements, and later on, your career.0 comments1"
2,"Julia ChanLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 08 Oct 2018Yes, because it is geared to comparing oneself against others on a narrow set of parameters that may not bring forth many other hidden strengths, and those who have fewer or no privileges to fall upon for help, struggle more0 comments1"

And probably when grades are regarded highly in Singapore, the stress and pressure to perform is probably more prevalent.0 comments0"
5,"Lee JiahuiLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 11 Oct 2018I had a stressful school life because of the school work load. Maybe partly because I wasn't as smart as the rest. The teachers also gave us so much homework that I found it impossible to complete. I barely made it with a lot of time spent on copying homework from friends. The only other activity that beat school life stress in terms of stressfulness was breastfeeding. Basically school stress set my max threshold for stress, which could be a good thing on hindsight.0 comments0"
