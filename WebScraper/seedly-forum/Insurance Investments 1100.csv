God of WisdomUpdated on 06 Jul 2019An annuity is a sum of money given to an insurance company and they in turn pay you back a stream of income for life.Immediate means they pay you starting immediately. Deferred would be after a period of usually 5 or 10 years.We don't have any immediate annuities available anymore. But plenty of deferred ones.1 comment2"
