1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 08 Oct 2018Both offer the essentially the same service - being able to buy into a counter on a monthly interval with a minimum of S$100 per counter per month. How they differ is ease of use and variety of counters available.​POSB will be fairly easy to start, can be done via any POSB or DBS atm. Only thing is the range of counters you can buy into - a grand total of 2.​Maybank KE will take some effort to set up, but it has the widest range among all the brokers/banks here that offer RSP into stock counters directly. ​Dividend payout wise, it will depend on the counter selected. But if you are buying into the same counter, there won't be any difference in the dividend payout as it's declared by the underlying counter.​Hope this helps.0 comments0"
