question,Retirement Investments Dividends Asked by AnonymousAsked on 08 Feb 2019What are some of the ways that I can start a High Dividends Payout Portfolio?I am looking especially for those with monthly/quarterly dividend payouts and the option to reinvest the payouts direct. My end goal is to reach around 40-50k per annum through dividend payouts alone. Is it possible?2 answersAnswerBump0

God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019If you have some investment horizon, look for growth first instead of dividends. You'll need to accumulate a million dollar portfolio to give you 50k per annum dividends. Also, you can set one up with an FA using funds, or look at individual bonds and stocks and REITs. 2 comments3"
2,"Question Poster08 Feb 2019Thanks for the reply Hariz! After some research, it helped to clear some things up! What would you suggest, given if I had about 30+ years ahead to invest, to start off with?Hariz Arthur Maloy09 Feb 2019That's a long time. I'd suggest to build a portfolio that can achieve 10% p.a returns. Maybe a 85% Equity, 15% Bond portfolio.

So 25% US Equities, 30% Asia Inc Japan Equities, 20% Europe Inc UK Equities, 10% Global Emerging Equity, 10% SG Bonds, 5% Asian High Yield Bonds."

MasterAnswered on 11 Feb 2019It's possible since I'm aiming for about 70 - 72k dividend payouts myself for my own retirement.You'd need between 700k - 900k to be comfortable and maybe less if you're want it urgently. I also offer such instruments that do exactly what you want - you  can have monthly income sent directly to your bank, automatically rebalanced and if you're not using the payout you can reinvest it. https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
