1,"Luke Ho, Kick-Ass Financial Services Consultant at Trillion Financial PlannersLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Jul 2019You should have all of your basic insurances first -
1) Your health insurance (shield upgrades)2) Your Life/TPD (total and permanent disability) insurance3) Your Critical Illness Insurance4) Optional: Personal Accident or Disability InsuranceYou may want to get a package for that kind of travel insurance with a high credit rating insurance company since it is for 6 whole months - it could potentially be cheaper than a non-package, especially if you are bringing someone with you.
There are no additional fees for talking to a consultant like myself, who offers multiple insurers like Liberty/AXA/NTUC nor will the cost of the insurance be affected, so you can always drop me a message and talk about specific details so I can recommend the most suitable package for you.
