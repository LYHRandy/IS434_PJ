1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Speaking from the perspective of someone who has been in VC for around a decade, I do think that the term 'venture capitalist' has become more sexy in the last decade especially with the boom in early-mid stage technology companies. Which also means that as valuations of tech companies grew and made huge exits, VC firms benefitted, and grew from that to raise Fund II, Fund III, so on and so forth. VC/PEs are essentially funds that look to invest in private companies, with the aim to get a good ROI. Sometimes, corporates have a VC arm as well. It could act as a way for the company to look outside its core area of expertise, and see what are adjacant sectors it could invest in to help them grow. It could also be exploratory - to see what new technologies are there that could potentially disrupt their business. I did notice that many corporates were starting to have their own 'VC' arms too - even Challenger did back in 2015!1 comment2"
