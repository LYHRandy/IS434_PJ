Grand MasterUpdated on 14 Sep 2019$200 per month is still YOUR money, albeit in investments for the long run.$2 per month (or 1%) is fees given. Probably can find cheaper fees elsewhere. In any case, 1% is about market rate.Earn a few cents? You shouldn't worry about only earning a few cents. You should be worry if there is a market downturn, and your portfolio start losing 1%, 5%, 10% or 20% or even worse... maybe 50%?Do you throw in the towel, give up on investing and never do it again?don't. Investment is for the long run, and the thing about regular investing is that you ride the UPs as well as the DOWNs.Read on more on investments so that when your portfolio starts falling, you don't panic and instead continue your plan. Investment is for 10 years, 20 years. A few months of drops is considered part and parcel.You may ponder more on potential losses than the ""few cents"" of earnings3 comments2"

God of WisdomUpdated on 02 Sep 2019Why do you think you'll earn a few cents quarterly?Also, you do not ""pay"" 200/mth. You're investing it.And an investment is not guaranteed, your investment can both appreciate into double-digit % or depreciate by the same amount or anywhere in between. I feel you should learn a bit more about investing, what you're investing in with the DBS RSP, before committing into anything.1 comment3"
