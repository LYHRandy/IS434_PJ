question,"DBS Multiplier Fresh Graduates DBS Savings Bank Account Investments General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 16 Oct 2018Urgent question: Do I need to hold off investing in POSB Invest-Saver until I open a DBS Multiplier account?Noticed that DBS Multiplier has this clause that states: Existing POSB Invest-Saver you purchased before opening DBS Multiplier will not be recognised. Does this mean that (1) I should avoid starting on POSB Invest-Saver at all, or (2) I can get started with investing in POSB Invest-Saver already. Just that the monthly ETF investments I made before opening my Multiplier account won't be recognised, but the ones made after will?2 answersAnswerBump0"
