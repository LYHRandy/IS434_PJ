1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Mar 2019For 2019, investors are skeptical of the prospect of FAANG stocks after all five stocks tumbled from record levels in 2018. In the face of slowing growth, rising macroeconomic uncertainties (trade policy and monetary policy), it is a risky enviroment for the FAANG stocks. There is also an increasing concern regarding tech regulations for the FAANG stocks. As the FAANG stocks are among the largest stocks in the market, these dominant players are seen as a proxy for overall investor sentiments. Therefore, if FAANG struggles, major indexes will be affected causing more market volatiliy.0 comments0"
