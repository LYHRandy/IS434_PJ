1,"Chua JovantreLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 29 Mar 2019Does your policy have a yearly cash back feature which you are entitled to take out? If so, you can consider taking out this cash back benefit and explore other avenues to put your money into.  Ultimately, you still need to diversify your investment portfolio even if you are aiming for higher returns. And, safer alternatives like endowment policies and bonds makes up part of it.0 comments0"

3,"Hariz Arthur Maloy04 Mar 2019It really depends on how long you have been paying for, the current surrender value and the IRR from today onwards. You'll have to do an opportunity cost calculation and break even rate on any investments you would replace this $100 with. The good thing about your endowment is at least it has guarantees and returns are predictable. Treat it like a bond. Speak to an advisor to see if it's worth it."
