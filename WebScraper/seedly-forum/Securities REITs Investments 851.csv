1,"Billy KoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Mar 2019Interesting point you raised here! In my perspective, I think one should understand the underlying business of REITS which is that of generating recurring income. Possessing freehold properties has definitely more pros than cons in a land-scarce city. However, the impact from owning freehold properties (which I can foresee) than leasehold properties in a portfolio would be that of the valuation since freehold properties are generally worth more than leasehold properties. Property in REITS = Assets, hence it only affects the balance sheet (NAV) and not the income statement (income / expense), Ultimately, a performance of a REIT still boils down to rental income & occupancy of it's assets.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 09 Jul 2019That should not be the only factor to determine whether it is better or worse.still boils down to valuation, yield, net gearing ratio and many other factors.  A reit may hold only freehold properties but command lower occupancies that another with leasehold properties in a better area. older freehold properties may also need higher maintenance or require money for constant refreshing of the property to attract tenants.0 comments0"
3,"Alp BaharLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 09 Jul 2019REITs generate income by selling their assest (properties) as well. Obviously a freehold property appreciates in value as time goes by, while leashold properties depreciate and theoritically they will worth nil at the end of the lease term (unless it is extended, which will be like buying the property you think you already own). This can become a huge issue as time is ticking towards the end of lease term, as the property will not be worth renovating and renting out.In my opinion REITs that own freehold assets should always be preferred in the long run.0 comments0"
