question,"Bank Account Investments General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 19 Sep 2018I had recently inherited $14.7 million (after conversion from GBP). I have no parents nor guardian since 1.5 years ago which is why I don't have anyone to talk to when it comes to finances. Any investment advice?I would like to gain some knowledge with regards to how I can invest without any risks involved. I'm a first year medical student and finance/investments aren't my forte so I hope you can excuse my newbie question. I do have a Singaporean uncle here in this country but I'm not close with him at all. I have read about investor's risk profile and I would say that I am very conservative, too conservative that I am not willing to take any risk. I've seen investment options that have high, moderate and low risks but nothing that says no risk. I have a minimalist lifestyle (eats in hawker centres, stays in school dorm, instant noodles, travels via metro) and am not looking to get rich as I am perfectly fine with extremely low rates of returns as long as it is higher than the HSBC Premier Savings Account I have right now which earns 0.1% interest rate. Would appreciate any feedback given. Thank you so much ^_^29 answersAnswerBump4"

1,"Christopher HowLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Can I just say that very few people (if any) in this community have experience handling this large sum of money. You're really better off speaking to wealth managers (not insurance agents, I'm talking about the real deal here).‚ÄãThey are the ones who can give you proper advice and they will do regular portfolio reviews with you.‚ÄãIf you are working with a wealth manager for the first time, don't hand over all your money to him/her. Let him/her manage $200,000-$500,000 and see how they work. Are they capable of doing a good job?‚ÄãIf yes, you can choose to double down on this wealth manager. Otherwise, you can always switch to find another one.5 comments18"

Im sure the asker will feel very appreciative also :) The SDIC one is a very legitimate concernShaun Goh23 May 2019Yup, just living off the passive income from these no to low risk instruments are way more than enough if you're not living a lavish lifestyle. *cannot imagine $14.7mil* @_@

Assuming you'd just draw down from the amount monthly for 80 years, that's $15k per month :D"
5,"Siti PutriLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I can understand your situation somewhat feeling lost not being sure whom to ask or seek advice from financially. Firstly ask yourself if you are genuinely keen to learn to invest because that in itself takes time, dedication, lots effort and honestly the interest.Thruthfully this $14mil could last 3 generations without even investing since you seem to be very prudent in your lifestyle and most likely will have a well paid career after graduation.Not all ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù can make money, in fact can even be in sub zero level loss if not careful like leveraging CFD etc.Since you know that you are conservative, I would just put in few FD in multiple banks. As HNW you can get special rates. Do becareful when any bank RM or insurance agents when they ask you to invest into products. You will be considered an accredited investor (AI) which means they can purposely give you risky stuff as their fiduciary duties don‚Äôt quite apply to AI. Think also about your future career. Is your intention to have your own clinic? If so, where will the clinic be? You might want to do research about buying a commercial unit where you could one day turn it into your own clinic. I am not sure if now is a time to buy but if you do invest in property in SG, I think you could consider commercial property which you could rent out too in meanwhile till you are ready to convert it you your hypothetical clinic.Do you think you want to live in SG or overseas? If u have plans to migrate overseas and defined sure where, suggest to purchase a property too. It could be for own stay in future be or rental.Since you mentioned that you are conservative. In general, I think besides the multiple FD, can consider real estate provided u do proper research on location. There will be rental yield and also capital appreciation. Also do lump sum put some money into your CPF SA, just to lock in for 4% interest. Do buy a good well covered health insurance too.You can also consider being a venture capitalist. This will be risky but there are courses from Angel Central ( I think) and you could network as well with entrepreneurs. Be diversified across different biz ventures if you decide on angel investing.Good luck with your studies. 1 comment5"

7,"Elsa GohLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Edit: Have the estate matters been settled? I assume the moneys were left to you in UK. You may need to appoint a solicitor in the UK or a lawyer in Sg who is able to advise on UK estate law and tax liability. Big name law firms in Sg are Rajah & Tann, Wong Partnership, KhattarWong, Lee&Lee. Check whether they have UK offices or ventures.But before you do that, pls ensure u have really inherited something and it is not a scam, as it sounds too good to be true.If this is true... congratulations. Also, when it comes to investing such a huge sum, this is beyond us. You need to appoint a fund manager or a banking advisor.By the way, please ensure you have the money in your account before you actually start spending. Sometimes these things can get tied up for ages. And be wary of nigerian princes.1 comment5"

9,"Leck Ting YanLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Please speak to a private banker. In fact, speak to a few if you have the time. If you are happy with monthly or annual payouts plus planning for generations down, perhaps let the banker know you'd want to look into setting up a trust fund for yourself and your future family. ‚ÄãThink most people agree that you need professional advice. Be wary about the investment products that the bankers will offer/advise you to take up. Risk should roughly equal the return and that all products should be low risk as per your appetite (which is why there is no such thing as no risk. Holding cash also constitutes risk from currency fluctutations and inflation)‚ÄãGiven current market conditions, many private bankers will be clamouring to have  you as a client. I do have a couple of friends in the space who've been helping Gen 1 or Gen 2 (Like yourself) manage their funds in UBS and DBS. You should go with whoever you feel comfortable with.1 comment4"

13,"Tan YapShengLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi there, Having that amount of inheritance immediately puts you under the High Net Worth category. When you‚Äôre at that playing field, there are many low risk options you can explore.‚ÄãI personally know a high net worth that deals with Private Placement Programs; it generates returns at minimal risk but it‚Äôs exclusive to the category. I can refer you to speak with him if you‚Äôre interested, afterall, it makes more sense for you to speak with someone who has been there and done that.1 comment2"
14,Kenneth Lou19 Sep 2018That is pretty interesting... private placement programs! :O 
15,"Koh Jun HuiLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 19 Sep 2018Firstly, recognise that there is no way investments come without risk. Investments without any risk involved are called scams. Even banks go bust - Lehman Brothers.  Lehman was the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank at the time of its collapse, with 25,000 employees worldwide (Nick, 2017). Get that clear and out of the way first because thats how people fall into scams when they hear a ""no risk"" investment.‚ÄãIf you really want no risk, leave the money in the bank. SDIC covers per person up to $50,000 per bank, so you might want to diversify. ‚ÄãThe next option try Singapore Savings Bond,  Maximum individual holding: $100,000 according to their website. Its backed by the government. Again, there's risk, however its from a government with AAA credit rating. So, again, are you alright with the risk? ‚ÄãJust like what Elsa said, you might be better off with a fund manager or financial advisor instead of asking a community. However just be aware and learn some of these phrases like when can institutions use ""Capital Guaranteed"" or ""Protected"" etc. So you won't fall prey to people trying to use you for their own gains. ‚ÄãLastly, you are fortunate with this inheritance, do some charity work, it's happiness is what money cannot give you. ‚Äã0 comments2"
16,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 19 Sep 2019TBH, once you have that amount of money, you can be sure that said wealth managers will be able to find you and offer their services. I only have a tiny sliver of $14.7m in bank accounts but strangely was assigned to talk to pretty wealth managers on products to buy.
Like you say, if you are not looking to get richer than you are, don't want to take risk and are ok with anything higher than the HSBC Premier Savings Account, then I would recommend Citibank Maxigain Savings Account. With the step-up interest, you would be able to definitely earn more than 1%. That said, it's only up to the first $150k I believe.
Then put your money into other high yield savings accounts or FDs. That's about all I can recommend if you want no risk.
Also, loving that minimalist lifestyle, but invest in your health and don't eat too much instant noodles. You are a medical student after all! ;D0 comments1"
17,"Amanda Ho, Financial Planner at AXALevel 2. RookieAnswered on 21 Sep 2018Hi there, would recommend getting a savings plan or a long term investment plan to growth your wealth. Savings plans are at generally at 3% interest and investment plans can have interest as high as 10% or higher (after deductions of all charges). ‚ÄãCurrently i might have something that could help you achieve your goals as well as achieve your retirement needs.If you're interested feel free to FB message me. I would be glad to share what i have with you and add value to you. ‚ÄãSide note: With that amount of money, it's better to diversify it instead of throwing a lump sum into an account/plan/investment/biz. It's always good to have a few platforms of income to better protect what you already have and minimise the lost. ‚ÄãDisclaimer, i'm not an insurance agent.0 comments1"
18,"Alvin Teo, Financial Planner at Promiseland Independent Pte LtdLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 20 Sep 2018I would firstly opt out of ‚ÄòAccredited Investor‚Äò status first, otherwise, anyone can ask you to sign anything without explaining to you.‚Äãbeing conservative, i would not invest it just yet especially when you are in school. Maybe put FD or manage it in Citibank‚Äôs Maxigain.‚Äãbut whatever you do, opt out from AI status first‚Äã‚ÄãIf you‚Äòre investing, I read somewhere in HWZ from a master called Shinythings about cash creation, someone asked about creating/redeeming directly from ABF bond fund, his reply: Anyway. If you've got more than $50k to invest in A35 in one lump, you can request that your broker do a ""cash creation"" - where you hand the cash over to your broker, they hand it to the fund manager, and the fund manager hands the broker newly-created shares, priced at the NAV instead of the market price. This is good because you don't pay any spread, and you don't pay any brokerage, but the broker does tend to charge a fee for it (I've seen 0.3-0.5% when clients have done it before, but the fee is entirely negotiable).   II read somewhere in HWZ from a master called Shinythings about cash creation, someone asked about creating/redeeming directly from ABF bond fund, his reply: or A35. DBS can do it, but the RMs are all clueless; you'll need to escalate a few times to find someone who knows how to make it happen.I0 comments1"
19,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Sep 2018Glad that you are seeking advice on what possibilities there can be with this huge amount. Not much most of us here can advice as we do not really come across such a high amount. ‚ÄãIt is not possible to invest without some amount of risk, other than leaving it in fixed deposits or savings accounts. Even then, there's only financial insurance under the Deposits Insurance Scheme for such accounts, limited to S$50,000 per financial institution. So it will be a good idea to spread the funds out among different banks to take advantage of this scheme. ‚ÄãWith such a quantum of funds, you will be eligible for private banking services / acredited investor services across the banks here. Hence, seek out professional advice of a relationship or wealth manager at the banks, and see what solutions they can come up with.. It will be likely that special interest rates for savings accounts or fixed deposits can be given to you if you ask for it. Just don't get drawn into signing up for solutions offered by insurance companies (huge fees involved), which with acredited investor status, they do not need to disclose to you. Hence you will need to be careful and look at what documents you are being asked to sign. ‚ÄãSingapore Savings Bonds will also be a good choice, since it's backed by our government here. Or you can also see if you can access the government bond market here, since our government does auction bonds here on a regular basis. Do buy the bond outright and avoid buying into a fund of bonds.‚ÄãAs an alternative to investment, you may also consider using part of the inheritance to start a foundation to bless others who are in need. Talk to a tax consultant to see if this may provide some tax relief for you. Starting a foundation may also provide non tangible benefits like brand recognition once you embark on your professional medical career. ‚ÄãDo seek further counsel if necessary, especially from those who are of this networth level. ""Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed."" Hope this helps and all the best. 0 comments1"

22,"William Seah, Financial services consultant  at PiasLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 19 Sep 2018invest without risks? That‚Äôs possible only if you don‚Äôt want returns. Return is reward for risk. You sacrifice returns for lower risk. That‚Äôs why plans with guaranteed returns often have low risk; and low returns. ‚ÄãWhat do you want to do? What‚Äôs your ideal life like? Once you can work out what you want to do, what you ideally wish to have in life, you‚Äôll have a better understanding of what money means to you, and then you can set goals and plans for your money. ‚ÄãDon‚Äôt get caught up with the pursuit of yields.
