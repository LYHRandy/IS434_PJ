MasterAnswered on 12 Nov 2018My mum owns property in Malaysia, but I don't think she pays tax in SG for it, so in short I don't think so!However, I believe that Malaysia does place a heavy tax on Singaporeans owning porperty in Malaysia. Again, not sure of the exact figures, but because of this, my mother prefers to sell the property when she is older instead of passing it on to us.0 comments1"
