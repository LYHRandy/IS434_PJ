3,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Oct 2018If i could turn back time, i would have done more homework before putting my money in certain stocks. Back then, I put money into the 3 Telcos (Singtel, Starhub, M1). Foolish decision, as I should not have put my money into all 3 Telcos in the same industry. Then came the news regarding the 4th Telco. The 3 stock prices dropped and never recovered since. My heart has also not recovered since. Luckily I sold them off before the stock prices got to what it is like today.0 comments0"
