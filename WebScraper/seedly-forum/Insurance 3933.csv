1,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 11 Feb 2019I got a whole life plan with 300k ECI and a term CI for 200k, which is just under the amount I make a year (you get 5 years CI).I also have 1 mil in death coverage, which is excessive, but I want my people to have something in the event I have an unexpected death. Basically practice what I preach to clients, at least. It would be bad to be hypocritical, no ? 0 comments0"
