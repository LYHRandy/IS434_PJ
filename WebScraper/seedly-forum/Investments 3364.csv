That's the principles of value investing of buying low and selling high when the price get back to it's fair value. ​It's kind of personal as Investing is 80% psychology and 20% strategy. You have to control your emotions. Don't let emotion cloud your judgement.​Warren Buffet quote, ""if you are not willing to own a stock for 10 years, do not even think about owning it for 10 minutes.""​I hope I have helped you in this post, all the best and godspeed! ​0 comments2"

4,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 18 Jun 2018Hey Jay! This is a pretty personal question but I think it really goes back to your initial hypothesis of buying the stock itself. I have always advocated the idea of investing rather than trading. ​Hence when you buy a certain stock, you would most likely buy it for some form of undervalued reason or long term growth potential.​This would also refer to the term 'Drawdown' where it is referring to a decline in an investment or fund. ​That being said, interested to know what others think!0 comments1"
