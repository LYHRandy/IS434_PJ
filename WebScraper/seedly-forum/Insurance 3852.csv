God of WisdomAnswered on 22 Apr 2019I'm sorry to hear about your condition but I'm glad it has been removed.However, cancer patients have an almost impossible time getting coverage for health/hospitalization insurance.Even for life cover, chances are still very slim but possibly higher to get covered for other CIs other than Cancer. I would suggest that you keep a very high amount of emergency cash in the event of a relapse. You can't take much risk with money, so try to build as much guaranteed streams of income so that you'll be able to continue living in comfort should the worst happen again.0 comments0"

Especially so for cancer since the chances of relapse is there.However, you may consider looking at international health care plans which will cost a Bomb.A suggestion is that you also take up a personal accident plan, so that in the event that an accident occurs, at least some cost or benefit can still be covered.1 comment0"

It also depends on the stage of cancer you had, and how long ago it was since you have been declared cancer free.
