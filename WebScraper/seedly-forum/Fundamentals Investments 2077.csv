1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 21 Mar 2019Building on what Zann mentioned, there are a few other forms of investments that very risky. Penny Stocks: Penny stocks trade outside of the main exchanges and have a love market cap and low share prices. These shares are very risky because there the information regarding these companies could be very skim and unreliable. There are also no minimum standards unlike those listed on major exchanges. Finally, these companies could also be very new or on the brink of collapsing. The lack of liquidity of these stocks means that it might be very hard to find your buyers for your stock if you want to sell them. Junk Bonds: These are bonds issued by companies with such weak credit strength that the credit rating agencies have classified them as ""junk"". These bonds provide high coupon rates and high returns, but the catch is that there is a high chance that the company may default on their coupon or principal payments, and you may never get your money back. Emerging / Frontier Markets: Companies developing in these regions are probably newer, and still have a lot of exposure to different kinds of firm specific risk. However, political and social instability, inflation rate risk, military risk and volatile exchange rates can make investments in these countries more risk. But there is also a range of countries that are within this band, and some of them are much less risky than the others.P2P Lending: Again this has a whole spectrum of companies involved, but there are some which are quite risky. Having worked in a P2P firm before, I have seen loans (from other platforms) being disbursed to companies that have very weak credit strength at extremely attractive returns of 20+%. These companies have a much higher chance of defaulting.In countries which do not have proper P2P systems or platforms in place, fraud could be common where companies just run away. Funds have also been lost because of the complicated tracking system and lack of due dilligence.0 comments1"
2,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Mar 2019Hello!There really isnt a most risky form of investment as all types of invesment are bound to have risks. Here are some investments which are considered to be more risky.1) Options, the prices of listed market options are often changing unpredictably. People who invest in options may lose large amounts of money in a very short period of time. People who invest in options are usually those with a lot of experience2) Futures, Futures carry high risks especiallt for those who are not very experienced and who do not have much knowledge in investing.  Those who invest in such markets are usually putting themselves against institutional investors. 3) Oil and gas exploratory drilling, There is usually a very high chance of a large or total loss when engaging in an exploratory drilling venture. 4) IPOs, IPOs carry large risks, many of the IPOs often fail to deliver what they promise. It is important to fully understand the company model before investing in IPOs5) I personally feel that the most risky form of investment occurs when you listen to what other people tell you to buy without fully understanding what you are buying or the business model of the company that you are buying.0 comments1"

5,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Mar 2019IMO, the riskiest form of investment is the one you make without doing your own due diligence. I.e: listening to tips from friends/family/colleagues/etc and then investing straight without researching, etc0 comments0"
6,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Mar 2019Definitely derivatives - CFDs and like what Mr Jonathan Chia has said, trading on margins. Since trading with derivatives leave you will no potential cap to losses, and the ability to tap on leverage to inflate your position you will see very huge swings in your Profit and Losses (PnL) when you trade these instruments. 1 bad trade leads to another emotional bet twice the size to recoup your losses, and you end up with huge amounts of losses that could be twice, thrice, five times your initial investment. always be careful with these derivatives!0 comments0"
7,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Mar 2019Instruments on margin, if you don't know what you are doing. You stand to lose not just your account but more if your positions and risk management are not done properly.0 comments0"
