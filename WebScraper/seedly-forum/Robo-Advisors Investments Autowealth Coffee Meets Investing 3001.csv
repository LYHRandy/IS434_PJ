1,"Tai ZhiLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 10 Jul 2018FX RisksAt present moment, FX hedging is very costly especially for portfolios below S$1m in size. We do not foresee FX hedging cost reducing to a cost-efficient level over the next few years. ​As and when hedging cost significantly reduces to a cost-efficient level, we will be more than happy to offer FX hedging option to our clients.​You may also note that USD and SGD are major currencies and they tend to be relatively more stable compared to other emerging markets currencies.​Therefore, while FX risk is material, FX risk is not significant. This is especially so for investors who have a medium to long term investment horizon. For example, the AutoWealth Balanced Portfolio (60% stocks, 40% govt bonds) achieved 15.7% returns net of fees on a USD basis over the last 26 months since inception. The same portfolio achieved 16.4% net of fees on a SGD basis over the same period. Therefore, the difference of 0.7% due to FX impact is relatively small.​Tax ImplicationsThe U.S. imposes a withholding tax on dividend payments made out of U.S. listed securities. These are automatically deducted at source before the net dividends are credited into the client's custody account in his/her legal name. ​Despite a relatively higher withholding tax, ETFs listed in the U.S. are still preferred over ETFs listed in other countries like the U.K. after taking into consideration factors including liquidity, bid-ask spread, expense ratio, ETF fund size amongst other factors. 0 comments0"
