God of WisdomAnswered on 16 Sep 2019You have 3 options.1) Transfer OA to SA until SA hits the Full Retirement Sum of 176k.2) Invest 230k of your OA. I suggest going for a globally diversified balanced portfolio. This is something Financial Advisors like myself can offer.3) Do both. Transfer OA to SA until SA hits the FRS and then invest the rest of OA above 20k.One last thing you can just before turning 55, would be to do a SA shielding by investing your SA one month before the RA is created as it will attempt to deduct from your SA first to satisfy your FRS.0 comments4"
2,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2019It depends on what you want to do and achieve from it? (1) When do you need the money? You can withdraw anything above FRS at age 55(2) Do you want two accounts (SA and RA) to earn 4% interest for you?(3) Are you ok to pledge your housing and rent it out, so that you can choose to put Basic Retirement Sum instead? This is because you still can top it up later(4) Will you withdraw 20% of your RA when you reach 65?I think it's a bit difficult to advise, would be good base on the above parameters.But the general guideline by Hariz is good enough for most people who have simple needs (not really needing the money and can invest long term till 65).0 comments0"
