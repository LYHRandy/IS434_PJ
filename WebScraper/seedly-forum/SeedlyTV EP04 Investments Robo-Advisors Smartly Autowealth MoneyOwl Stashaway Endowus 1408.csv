1,"Christopher Tan, Executive Director at MoneyOwl Private limitedLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Dear AnonymousThank you for your question. I understand where you are coming from when you say that you would like to buy low and sell high. while it would be perfect to do that, the reality is that it is quite difficult to do so and evidence tell us that most people fail to beat the market. But what evidence also tell us is that regardless of when you enter the market, over the long term (at least 10 years), the stock markets always go up.It is with this in mind that at MoneyOwl, we do not attempt to time the market (please note that not all robos believe in the same philosophy). You can invest at anytime and at MoneyOwl, being a bionic financial adviser, we do our very best to help you ignore short term noises and stay invested for the long term. What we will also do is that we will do regular rebalancing so that your portfolio will always reflect the asset allocation that you are comfortable with. By rebalancing, it also helps you to lock in some profits. As an example, when the equities markets go up and bonds come down, your portfolio will have more equities than bonds - more than how your original portfolio should look like. What rebalancing will do is that it will sell equities (that have gone up in price) and buy some bonds (that have gone down in price). So in doing rebalancing, you are in effect doing some “buy low and sell”. I have written an article on the topic of marketing timing and you might want to read it here https://advice.moneyowl.com.sg/breaking-the-addiction-to-active-management/MoneyOwl is also holding an investment symposium and you can sign up for it here https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/moneyowl-investment-symposium-registration-60702740531Hope this helps!2 comments6"
2,"Question Poster06 May 2019Thanks man will read it up. I believe moneyowl is looking in DFA instead of ETFs? what are the advantages of moneyowl robo compared to the rest?Christopher Tan06 May 2019Hi Anonymous, thank your for your question. You are right. At MoneyOwl, we have decided to use DFA funds instead of ETFs. To read more on why we made this decision, you can read it here https://advice.moneyowl.com.sg/why-unit-trusts-and-not-etf/

With regard to our advantages as compared to the rest of the robos, please allow me to repost an earlier answer here:

3,"Lim Boon Tat, Applied Mathematics at Brown UniversityLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019In a very (very) general sense, any investment strategy that involves (i) regular contributions and (ii) regular re-balancing, will result in the illusion that you are buying low and selling high.   Let me explain(1) Regular monthly contributions for example, will buy equities/bonds for you every month. This means that you are buying a fixed value (not a fixed number) of shares every month.  When the share price becomes higher next month, it technically means that you bought in low the previous month. (2) Rebalancing almost guarantees that you will lock in some returns.  For example, if you're on a 60/40 portfolio mix of 60% equities vs 40% bonds, when equities rally (go up in price) and the mix becomes 75-25, your robo-advisor will start sell some equities (selling high) and buy more bonds (buying low, relatively at least). In your specific case of equities doing badly, the robo-advisor will actually start buying more of equities given (A) your fixed monthly contribution of $X; and (B) equities typically fall faster than bonds  so to make sure your portfolio mix remains, the robo-advisor will spend more money buying equities. In an aggregate sense, robo-advisors dont do too badly.2 comments3"
4,"Question Poster06 May 2019Thanks for the detailed explanation. does all robos work that way. Seems like each have its own methodology and cant seem to find more info on how they actually choose the assetsLim Boon Tat06 May 2019In general, most robos SHOULD work this way, and if you want to benefit optimally from robos, you SHOULD work this way as well (monthly contributions).  The underlying philosophy (and main questions) you need to ask is whether (A) you want to DIY or outsource investment to an external party and (B) you want active or passive management.

(A) By going to a robo-advisor, you seem to be choosing to outsource.

5,"Tai Zhi, Chief Investment Officer at AutowealthLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Yes, AutoWealth helps you to take advantage of excessive market volatility to lock in extra returns from selling high and buying low through portfolio rebalancing. Read on to know more... Significant market movements may cause portfolio assets to deviate from their original intended allocation weightage. AutoWealth rebalances clients’ investment portfolios timely to realign the allocation weightage of portfolio assets to maintain a consistent risk profile for all our clients and for robust risk management.For example, the escalated U.S.-China trade tensions in 4Q 2018 caused Emerging Market Stocks to decline materially and U.S. Government Bonds to rise materially causing an underweight in Emerging Market Stocks and an overweight in U.S. Government Bonds. In this case, AutoWealth will sell and take profit on some U.S. Government Bonds whilst using the sales proceeds to buy some Emerging Market Stocks at the market discount to realign the allocation weightage of portfolio assets.In another example, the eased U.S.-China trade tensions in 1Q 2019 caused Emerging Market Stocks to rise materially and U.S. Government Bonds to rise by a smaller margin causing an overweight in Emerging Market Stocks and an underweight in U.S. Government Bonds. In this case, AutoWealth will sell and take profit on some Emerging Market Stocks whilst using the sales proceeds to buy some U.S. Government Bonds to realign the allocation weightage of portfolio assets.Our portfolio rebalancing is supported by well-established research, including those documented in “Pioneering Portfolio Management David F. Swensen, CIO of Yale Endowment Fund”. The research concluded that threshold-based rebalancing statistically generates extra investment returns by exploiting excessive price volatility.2 comments0"
6,"Question Poster10 May 2019Thanks Tai Zhi, Separate question, since Autowealth does not allow fractional share. does that mean some of the invested lets assume e.g 500 monthly, would not get fully invested?Tai Zhi11 May 2019Typically, for an investment portfolio of $10,000, the residual cash will be lower than 1% of the portfolio. This means that 99% of the investment capital are invested. Therefore, we are quite efficient in investing the capital whilst maintaining the highest safeguard possible for you. The same cannot be said when you invest in a unit trust or with other robo-advisors. Pls watch this video for other FAQs: https://www.facebook.com/1563327363984028/posts/2227537154229709/"
