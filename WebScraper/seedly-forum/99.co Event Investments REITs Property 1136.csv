2,"Ryan OngLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 11 Jun 2019Property provides a higher degree of leverage, given that you can get LTV ratios of about 70% quite easily. REITS require you to use entirely your own cash. On top of that, you have little control over the investment when it’s a REIT. Even if it’s run into the ground, the manager isn’t going to pay back a single dollar of the fees.With direct ownership of the property, you can decide how much goes into asset enhancement, who the tenants are, whether each expense  is really ncessary, and forth.0 comments0"

WonderkidAnswered on 26 May 2019Hi, Douglas here, 2nd Keynote speaker.I won't say it's an equivalent as REITs and actual ownership of properties are 2 different things altogether.IF you were to invest in REITs make sure you anaylse it like any regular stock. Analyse its assets, how they are positioned and the risk they face. Not all REITs perform, Some underperforming ones are ESR, AIMS AMP etc where reits holder suffer drop in share price and DPU.Reits definitely have lower cost to entry, so worth considering but always do your homework. Don't buy into any REIT blindly. REITs can go bust too.​​​
