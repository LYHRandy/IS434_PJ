WonderkidAnswered on 26 May 2019Hi Yin Ru, Douglas here. 2nd Keynote speaker from the event.Before you do anything, check with the banks first what is the amount of loan you can get. Remember that you cannot use CPF for commercial or industrial property.A lot depends on your status, if you are planning to settle down soon, then a residential property makes more sense for you, since I dun think your partner wants to live in an industrial or commercial unit with ya ans u can't stay in one too for residence (by law).If you are going to be single for the forseeable future or u have a supportive spouse or have accomodation settled, then you can explore commercial or industrial properties as an option.Meanwhile save up and less bubble tea!​​​

Remember, plan your finances properly, don’t overstretch, do your homework and enjoy your property investment journey.
