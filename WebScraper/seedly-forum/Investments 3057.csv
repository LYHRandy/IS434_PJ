WonderkidUpdated on 13 Nov 2018Unit Trusts:Most unit trusts will allow for a $1,000 initial lump sum but you will only be going into 1 fund (even though it will be fairly diversified). You may also consider investing in a Unit Trust which allows for a $100 per month contribution without having to start with a lump sum. This will be considered an active managed investment as the fund managers will be buying/selling when they spot an opportunity behind the scenes.ETFs:Similar to a Unit Trust but it will be passively managed (the fund managers will only buy/sell if the index there are changes to the index that they are tracking). POSB has a Invest-Saver programme where you can invest $100 per month into an ETF.Singapore Savings Bonds:Better than leaving the money in the bank & still have access to it should you need the money.Shares:Not recommended as you will only be able to buy into 1 company which is far too risky.0 comments0"
