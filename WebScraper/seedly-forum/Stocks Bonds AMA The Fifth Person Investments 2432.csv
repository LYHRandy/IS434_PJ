1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Bonds are much safer than stocks - largely due to bonds not being exposed to market risk- which is of course compensated with greater return.That being said there are still a multitude of risks bond investors are exposed to:Default risk- Non govt bonds hold small % of default risk no matter how insignificant it might be.*Interest rate risk- This is the main risk! While bond interest payouts will not change , the real yield and prices of bonds will drop as interest rates(or inflation) increases.Call risk- Only applies to callable bonds. Bonds may be prematurely terminated.Reinvestment risk- Coupon value might not be able to be reinvested at same rate as original bond.1 comment3"

3,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Mar 2019Depends on the type of bonds you buy. If you buy non-investment grade (looking at lower than BBB- on Fitch's or S&P rating) you will be buying ""speculative"" bonds - which means that these bonds have a relatively high default rate, and their companies may not have the ability to fully meet the debt obligation through to the end of the debt's term. Comparing speculative, non IG bonds to a blue chip like DBS, I rather pick DBS. The yields on these junk bonds can go up to 30% ~ 40% which sounds very attractive, sure, if they pay till maturity, but these bonds tend to end up defaulting a few years later. Very volatile, very dangerous to play with large amounts of capital and if you don't know how to evaluate the health of a company, and the ability for them to meet obligations.So TLDR: comparing investment grade bonds with a equivalent in the stock: perhaps a blue chip, then yes, bonds are safer since they are mostly capital guaranteed with a less than 1% chance of defaulting + better ability to get back capital when company goes bankrupt since debtors get money first before stockholders. but a penny stock and a equivalent junk bond -- Very difficult to say which will be better.Each are very volatile in their own right, I rather not risk my money on something I don't understand.0 comments0"
4,"Isaac ChanLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 21 Feb 2019I would say that the answer really depends on what bonds and stocks you can compare with. For bonds they are generally safe but pay attention to the credit ratings given by rating agencies such as Moody's, Fitch and S&P.Long-term government bonds from the US are considered virtually risk-free since the chances that the US can't pay the principal and coupons for the bonds are extremely low. It is often seen as the ""risk-free rate"" used by investors. Governments have defaulted on their debt before though (https://www.worldfinance.com/strategy/government-policy/top-5-worst-defaults-in-history)Bonds also have covenants that the borrower has to meet. Basically, they are a set of conditions that the borrower has to meet as set out in loan agreements. They can be broken down into Positive and Negative Covenants. In short, positive covenants are actions that the borrower must do, such as having audited financial statements or meeting certain financial benchmarks. Negative Covenants are things that the borrower can't do, such as taking on even more debt. If these covenants are broken, the lender can actually take actions against the borrower, such as increasing interest rates or increasing principal payments of the loan.Covenants are to protect the lenders in ensuring that (1) borrowers don't increase their credit risk over time (2) lenders are compensated if borrowers become more risky.Such covenants do help bonds to be safeguarded, and to reduce their risk profile vis-a-vis investments in stocks.Read more about covenants here:https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/debt-covenants/https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/debt-covenants/0 comments0"
5,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Feb 2019Hello!There is not really an answer to this question as both carries their own risks and it is unlikely that one will be safer than the other. Bonds are likely to be safer than stocks when the comparison is within the same company.Here are some reasons why bonds are said to be better.1) Bonds have a lower risk as compared to stocks. This is because if a company were to liquidate, bondholders will have superior claims as compared to the shareholders of the company. 2)Those holding bonds are paid their principal upon maturity while there are no guarantee returns for shareholders.Deciding whether you want to invest in bonds or stocks will depend on the type of investments we are looking for. Bonds are more suitable for wealth preservation while Stocks are more suitable for wealth accumulation. 0 comments0"
6,"Victor Chng, Co-Founder at Fifth Person Pte LtdLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 20 Feb 2019Hi,I don;t think bond are safer than stocks or vice versa. I think the key is to understand the risk of each investment. If you know what you are investing in and understanding the underlying risk of the instrument than your safe level will increase.0 comments0"
