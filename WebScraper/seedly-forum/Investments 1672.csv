If you believe in the future expected return EM will give you for the risk you take, approach it with a holistic view and look at everyone of them but be stringent.Only invest in countries that have a good legal system for investors, provides accurate financial statements with strict and enforced accounting standards, reasonable treatment for foreign investors, with a reliable settlement system and with enough liquidity in terms of daily turnover.That will give you about 21 countries to invest in.0 comments0"
