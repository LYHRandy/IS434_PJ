The question that you should ask yourself is ""What is the purpose of buying your property?"".HDB Resale has always been a popular option as the first home for many. After all, it is public housing and many aspects are subsidized by the government, from the Proximityy hosuing grant, to recurring Service and Conservative charges, as well as U-Save vouchers. However, do note that as public housing, there are subjected to more criterias such as a Minimum Occupancy Period(MOP) before you can rent, or sell it.On the other hand, if you desire condo facilities, then you may wish to opt for a condo. However, since it is private housing, the vast majority of costs will have to be borne by you. There are more relaxed rules for renting out private properties.Some useful links for you to check out:https://thesmartlocal.com/read/buying-hdb-flat-resale/https://dollarsandsense.sg/hdb-ownership-debate-4-differences-owning-hdb-private-property/All the best for your housing journey!Zen0 comments1"
