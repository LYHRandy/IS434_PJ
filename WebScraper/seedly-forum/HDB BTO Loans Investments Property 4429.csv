Therefore, you should try to clear off your loan asap before beginning investing and only invest with money that you can afford to lose. 0 comments0"

Investments that are guaranteed pays like 2%-3% interest which i dun think is more that your student loan interest. Investments that have more interest than your student loan are not guaranteed. So my opinion is to finish paying the loan first and then start investing. Be frugal and pay finish debt as fast as you can so that it wont get more expensive. 0 comments0"
