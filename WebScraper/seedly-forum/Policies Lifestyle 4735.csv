I wrote about this recently and thought it might be good to share the key pointers here which I found.As with any organisation or Multinational Corporation (MNC), the Salary structure of Ministers are modelled closely.There is actually a 50 page white paper by the Public Service Division (PSD) detailing the full rationale of the compensation packages.A Singapore Minister’s salary is made up of a fixed component and a variable one.However, for the Prime Minister, he does not receive a Performance bonus because there is no one to assess his performance annually. Instead, the PM’s salary is tied to twice the MR4 minister’s salary = 1.1M x 2In fact, after some debates, there was a revision in salaries from 2010, which was also detailed here.0 comments1"
