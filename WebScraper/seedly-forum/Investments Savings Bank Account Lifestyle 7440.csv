1,"GLGhazali LokmanLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Do be mindful of 'Dishonest misappropriation of property'!403.  Whoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use movable property, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with both.Days of finders keepers are long gone with CCTV all around us. As I always say to my younger cousins, it's not worth it!Though how you found it does play a part, ie:(a)  A finds a dollar on the high road, not knowing to whom the dollar belongs. A picks up the dollar. Here A has not committed the offence defined in this section.(e)  A finds a purse with money, not knowing to whom it belongs; he afterwards discovers that it belongs to Z, and appropriates it to his own use. A is guilty of an offence under this section.https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PC1871?ProvIds=pr403-&ViewType=Advance&Phrase=theft&WiAl=11 comment3"

There was literally nobody around when I picked it up in terms of $50 x 4 notes.
