1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 23 Mar 2019Definitely. See if they are looking to expand into other business segments, and growing that revenue stream. If their main revenue segment (look at contribution by percentage) is the one that is losing market share, that would be a cause for concern. In addition, have a look at their profit margins. Declining profit margins year-on-year is also another signal that they are not able to command a price premium, and also that they are not able to compete as effectively against competitors. Also see if they are a B2B or B2C business. In the former, losing a few marquee clients would cause the impact. But for B2C, it might mean a general shift by consumers away from their products.0 comments1"
2,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Mar 2019Yes if the market share is in their main contributing business, no if they are actually trying to streamline their business and divesting away from non-profitable ones. Eg. Sony had alot of market share within the electronics industry back in the day, with laptops, phones, walkmans, TVS, gaming consoles - you name it, they probably have it. They commanded huge presence during the late 20th century, given that their products were extremely innovative and forward looking. However, with success sometimes comes complacency - their slow reaction to their competitors and market demand especially in the TV, laptop and phone industry basically reduced sony to a rather sorry state today relative to what they were previously - Giants that were unstoppable in the electronics market. For sony's case, their expansion into so many different markets was what led to their downfall. Their size was so large that it made it very difficult to approve and implement changes, unlike smaller, more specialized companies then like Apples with their phones or Sharp and their TVs for example. So, cutting their market share within these markets and divesting away from them is actually a good thing for Sony, since they are able to concentrate on what they are good at - their consoles and their image sensors! However, if you are Motorola, and all you have is a phone business, and you are losing market share in that, then i think it's a very worrying sign that you are being outpaced by your competition slowly but steadily.0 comments0"
