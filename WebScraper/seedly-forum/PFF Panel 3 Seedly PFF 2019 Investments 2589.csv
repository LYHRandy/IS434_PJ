How much would be a good amount would largely depend on yourself and how much cash that you have on hand that you are comfortable with putting into investing. Personally, I would put around $100-200 each month for investment in terms of a regular savings plan. Starting to invest as early as possible even though the sum may be small is a good start and much better than not investing at all! hope this helps.0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 01 Mar 2019After setting aside 6 months of your income as emergency expense, it's good to start with 20% of your income every month. Even as a student starting with just a hundred or two every month is already a good start.0 comments0"
