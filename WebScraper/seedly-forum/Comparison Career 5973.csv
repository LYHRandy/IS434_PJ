question,"Comparison Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 20 Sep 2018How much year-end bonus do one get in different industries, particularly data analytics? What else will I be missing out in terms of pay/benefits comparing freelance vs employed in MNCs?I am a fresh grad, and would like to calculate if I would earn more or less in freelancing vs corporate job. I can only think of missing out on the year-end bonus and CPF from employers. Also, I do not factor in the value of time flexibility so all of my calculations are monetary.8 answersAnswerBump0"

2,"Kok KoonLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 20 Sep 2018Adapted from another answer on savings​I graduated at 24. Worked for 14 months to pay off $11k student loan before going on my own at 26. Cos if bankrupt student loan still need to pay.​For your consideration, I benchmark my peers who are climbing the corporate ladder.​Just monetarily, my calculation was using the median income of my friends at $X,000.​I would need $X,000 x 12 months ( + 2 months bonus*) x 1.17 (additional 17% in CPF from employer) x 1.2 (20% Risk premium for selfemployment) to make sense for me to stay in business. Otherwise, I should go back to my corporate career.​*in your case, find out your industry's median and compute accordingly.​Edit: ​What you'd miss in MNCs:​Medical/Dental benefits, Learning and Development budgets (all-paid conferences, seminars, industry workshops and skills training), expensive database subscriptions for insituitions. Other subscriptions that will cost a lot more per utility as an individual.​===​Non-monetarity but still worth considering is the effective dollar per hour value of your time. If you make the same amount as your peers annually but you work 4 hours per day vs 8 hrs cos of efficiency, outsourcing and commute time saved, your pay is effectively x 2 of your peers.​You also spend lesser hours in meetings, buying office wear and wasting time in office gossips and politics. Convert these time into products and scale. You are in a super good niche. Can scale by your reputation. Treat your work as a business. You are good to go.0 comments3"
3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Sep 2018Amount of bonus you get depends on your performance, how you met your kpi for the year, and how much bonus pool is allocated to your country office for mncs. Some companies pay a 13th month on top of your variable, some incorporate it over the 12 months. Most mncs will also have some form of employee benefits, common ones will be group term, group hospitalisation, some sort of outpatient gp (either through flex or given a card). My current company and previous mnc I work for have flex benefits where you are given a certain amount to spend on vision care, dental, flights, gym membership, insurance premiums, etc. Some items are taxable and will be included in your income tax, some are not. Other fringe benefits may include annual company trips, movie outings, talks organised with external vendors to provide some awareness issue, etc. And of cos not forgetting CPF contributions. All these will not be available if you go for the freelance route. Pros and cons. Freelance wise, you are the boss and you decide on the projects you wanna embark on. If you are good at something but you are not sure whether it's sustainable, why don't you find a corporate role first, and freelance on the side? If your side income is sustainable and close to your day job's, consider going at it full steam. Hope this helps 0 comments1"
