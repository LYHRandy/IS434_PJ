MasterAnswered on 15 Oct 2018You're currently in quite a few efficient markets, so I'd suggest looking at  more inefficient markets like India and China for higher returns than what you're currently making. Somewhere in between there is Asia Ex-Japan as well. Ideally aiming for 8% and upwards. If you're more adventurous, consider more concentration into specific fields - like REITs, which you can do locally, and Tech Funds (ideally aiming for 11% and upwards).It still does depend on your profile, so consider talking to an FA like myself for guidance before making a decision. https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.54 I'd say that you're in a very good position to FIRE. 0 comments0"
2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Oct 2018Hmm what is your risk appetite like? If you are more adventurous beyond robo advisories, learn how to manage an options portfolio. I'd suggest that you attend a workshop on this to avoid the mistakes a newbie may make and also help you sleep well at night when trades turn against you. Find a mentor who teaches on repairing trades for this. Potential returns are upwards of 30% and more a year. 0 comments0"
