question,"Savings Bank Account Investments General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 06 Oct 2018Which other bank account(s) and alternatives with good returns would you recommend for me to ""park"" my excess money?I currently have UOB One account and DBS Multiplier account and I've maxed out the limit for good preferential interest rates. I also have some SSB on hand. Want to invest but not sure how to or what kind of stocks to buy :\Preference for options: not super long-term commitment (e.g. don't want to put in for 10 years), have some flexibility to withdraw after a certain period of time, able to beat inflation.3 answersAnswerBump0"

2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Oct 2018Can't say that current high yielding bank accounts apart from the ones you already have will beat inflation. Cimb's fast saver and citibank's maxi gain are often mentioned here and worth taking a look. For investments wise, perhaps you can look into buying into a basket of s-reits for a start, especially those with strong sponsors like mapletree. Or look to invest via robo advisory services.

MasterAnswered on 07 Oct 2018Hi, I would suggest either CIMB FastSaver which gives 1% and you can also consider their Fixed Deposit account which I feel, gives attractive returns. They are offering an additional 0.09% interest per annum for their FDs because of their 9th birthday last month and they have extended the promotion until the end of this month. Do check it out, 1.84% interest p.a for 12 months! Everything can be easily applied and online through 
their Clicks iBanking platform. httpsww.cimbbank.com.sg/en/personal/news-and-promotions/promotions/accounts/cimb-fast-fixed-deposit-promo.htmlI also opened a FD with them for 12 months last month to enjoy the 1.84% interest p.a 0 comments0"
