1,"Alvin TeoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 2d agoConsumer advise: avoid YouTube to seek answers because YouTubers’ phones are all about ram, space, usb type C (which I find it to be quite redundant, it’s like putting racing rims on a bread and butter car). If you all along using iPhone and have other Apple devices, the ecosystem is good and worth to stay. Myself using iPhone 6S and still got updated to iOS 13. And my phone still quite fast. Can’t say the same about android phones, in my previous line of work, I have an iPhone and an Android phone, 2 years old iPhone faster than 1 year old android. If you curious about android, can try Xiaomi A3, it came out this year, it’s running Android one which is as pure android as it can be with little to no bloatware. Best of all it costs $299.0 comments2"
