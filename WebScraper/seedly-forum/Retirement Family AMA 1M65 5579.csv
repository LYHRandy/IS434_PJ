MasterAnswered on 07 Nov 2018The best legacy you can leave to your descendants is the financial know-how to become rich and the ability for them to be independent and become rich themselves. I personally do not believe in giving my children too muchÂ which will only serve to spoil them and not to have the need and urgency to work hard and to be thrifty.0 comments1"
