1,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hello! You can look at;1) AlphaIt is the measure of an invesment's performace on a risk-adjusted basis. the higher the alpha the better.2) BetaIt is a measure of volatility of a security or portfolio compared to the market as a whole.  Conservative investors who wish to preserve capital should focus on securities and fund portfolios with low betas while investors willing to take on more risk in search of higher returns should look for high beta investments. 3) R-squaredIt is a statistical measure that represents the percentage of a fund portfolio.  Mutual fund investors should avoid actively managed funds with high R-squared ratios, which are generally criticized by analysts as being ""closet"" index funds.1 comment1"

God of WisdomAnswered on 08 Mar 2019You look at its risk ratios (Sharpe, sortino, beta, volatility). Top holdings (are they too concentrated on just a few stocks). Fund mandate (how much can the fund manager choose to move away from the fund's original intention). Assets under management (compare them against other competing funds and see if they're managing too little monies or are they a gigantic fund) Total holdings (are they diversified across only 30 stocks or 200 or 5000 - less doesn't always mean more risky however).Are they a large cap, mid cap, small cap equity fund, for bond funds what is the average credit rating of their bonds. Find out their worst performing month. How many total months of underperformance against positive months. Track record of the fund and fund manager. Still a few more to consider, but this is what I have at the top of my head for the time being.0 comments0"
