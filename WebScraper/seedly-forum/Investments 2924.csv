1,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Dec 2018ADR is a security that represents shares of a non-U.S. company that is held by a U.S. depositary bank outside the United States. If you wan to invest in Alibaba (a Chinese company) in NYSE, you will have to do it through ADR. There are different types (sponsored vs unsponsored), different levels (1-3) and different ratio (ADR to no. of shares). You have to be aware of the exchange rate risk and different tax laws in the different country you are investing in. It's best to do your own research before buying.0 comments0"
