1,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Feb 2019Good question - though this method does have some subscribers, it is quite difficult to execute effectively in real life.Before dividends are paid out - they have to be declared first. This declaration will also cut off the date of purchase of stock eligible for the said dividend payouts (which is known as an (which is known as an ex-dividend date), and usually these declaration dates are quite some time before the actual payment of dividend. As a result, before such ex-dividend dates usually new investors are willing to pay a premium for the stock, hence driving the price of the stock up. If you were to purchase the stock just before this date, the cost of trade + premium you pay for the stock will most likely make the gain from dividend non-existent.After the ex dividend date is declared, usually the stock price falls - because now investors are not willing to pay more for a stock that they are not eligible for the dividends of. Hence, if investor confidence and stock fundamentals are not strong in the first place, you are looking at potential capital losses on the trade.After all, there is no free lunch in the rather efficient stock market. i think it is more advisable purchase high paying dividend stocks that payout consistently because it aligns with your investment goal in the long term, such as REIT.0 comments2"

3,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Feb 2019Because the price of the stock drops in relation to the dividend. E.g Stock is priced at $1.00 By dividend payout, it goes up to $1.03. Dividend is $0.03. Stocks drops to $1.00 again.Also, most dividend announcement follows Financial Year reporting. Hence, it may also contribute some risk into just doing this.Even if you hold longer to wait for the price to recover, what if it doesn't?Case in point.
