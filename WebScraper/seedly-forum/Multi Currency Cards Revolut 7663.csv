1,"RLReb LiewLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated 3w agoFor recurring online transactions, there's no need to use a disposable/self-destructing virtual card - since its purpose is to prevent credit card theft/fraud for one-off transactions.Instead, you could just stick to using a virtual card - you're allowed to hold up to five in your wallet per month - and assign a recurring payment to each of them, e.g. Spotify on one card, HDB loans on another.Also, only Premium and Metal members enjoy unlimited virtual cards; Standard members get one free virtual card, and will have to foot another S$9 for each subsequent virtual card.Hope this helps!
