MasterAnswered on 22 Apr 2019Considering your current situation then it might be better to invest your money else where or even keep it in a fixed deposit. It would be locked in for a long time and you might need the cash.0 comments0"

WonderkidAnswered on 22 Apr 2019I think you have to decide whether you would like liquidity.If you are in good health and unlikely to have any circumstances where you would need large sum of money. That 30k would make around $200 or more difference monthly when you would like to start your CPF life payout.Assuming you start at 65, your top up would benefit some time when you are 80.0 comments0"

Even though cpf offers high interest rate you have to weigh the pros and cons of leaving the money and not being able to withdraw all of it.0 comments0"
