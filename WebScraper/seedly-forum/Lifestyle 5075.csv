question,"Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked on 13 Nov 2018I have a joint account with my mum (who is retired). Just today, I found out that has many transactions buying TOTO and 4D, and that she spends more than $500 every month on it. What should I do?Since it's her money, should I just let her continue? Or should I step in and talk to her about it?6 answersAnswerBump1"

Assure her that if the numbers she buys comes out, you will pay her the same amount Singapore Pools will pay. If the numbers do not come out, you can save the money for her and use the money to pay her if she ever win. The chances of her winning.....is low anyways2 comments6"

5,"EdLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 20 Nov 2018It is unlikely that your mum (who is retired) would spend more then $500 every month on lottery and furthermore use NETS to pay for it from the joint account she has with you instead of paying via cash or non-joint account knowing thay you would eventually be aware ?She could had strike big amount before so there is this enthusiastism or perhaps it could just be shared stakes with others. You could probably casually ask her to buy lottery for you and see how she replies ?
You have to ask her to minimise her stakes if she is indeed staking so much alone but i would suggest to forego asking her to stop buying totally as it would not work as most probably she will switch to pay cash instead because to a punter, money won is twice as sweet as money earned !  :)0 comments1"
6,Robin LimLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 13 Nov 2018Why she buy toto? Because itâ€™s a national sport.just kidding. find out why she buys Toto. Share with her other things she could do.she is probably too bored and the only thing she know is Toto?family and children too busy to earn money to keep her company?0 comments1
7,"Elsa GohLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 13 Nov 2018Depends on how much she has left right? If there's not much left or it will run out in a few years, then u better speak to her, see if she can slowly reduce instead of immediately cold turkey. If there's a lot left and it is not depleting at an unsustainable rate then just monitor and make sure she doesn't withdraw more and more per month bah.Best is dont spend on 4D or Toto at all la but is that her only entertainment? If u stop her will she be very unhappy? Maybe can set a lower quota.Actually your mother you know her better la. We can only suggest but u have to decide for yourself which is the best route.0 comments1"
