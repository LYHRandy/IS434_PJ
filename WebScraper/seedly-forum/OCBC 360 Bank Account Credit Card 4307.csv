MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Assuming salary credit $2000​For OCBC 360:Base interest: 0.05Credit salary:1.2Pay 3 bills online through GIRO with total amount of at least S$150: 0.3Spend min. $500 on OCBC credit cards: 0.3Total: 1.85%​For DBS Multiplier:Base interest: 0.05Credit salary: 1.55Total: 1.60%​However, if your salary credit is $5000 or more monthly, or have a 2nd salary credit (min. $2000), then DBS Multiplier is better. As it stands currently with the information given, OCBC 360 gives better interest.1 comment2"
