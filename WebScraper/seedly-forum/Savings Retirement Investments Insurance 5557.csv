1,"Leong Wen Fong, Community Lead at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 11 Dec 2018The same way you would reject him if he asked you to start smoking. Just say it's not something you are looking for, and that you are satisfied without it. But thank him for taking time out to show it to you, because unlike smoking, he is only recommending these because he wants to help.After which, go for some event together/do something, so that the memory of whatever you guys do together will over run the memory of ""rejection"". Thus making a much less awkward follow-up encounter.If he is insisting on it, then you have to think through why he is pushing something that you feel is not good for you, on you. If he wants to keep the friendship, I don't think he will do that though!0 comments3"
2,"Daniel LingLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019You seem to have already rejected him due to your beliefs.Have you given him a chance to explain why his still recommending?
If no, consider that. After which you can firmly reject without having to be polite.If you are plain not interested, just be firm.Friend is friend. Work is work.
He is advising you as a professional.
Rejections are part of being professional.2 comments3"

Can't spoil the relations too much cos all my policies done by him so far. Daniel Ling11 Dec 2018If you are worried about relations, then you have to find a new FA. Like right now."

Your friend must be very close to you but at the end of the day, you must know how to deal things personally and professionally. Rejecting something which doesn't suit your current status is absolutely fine. You friend should be able to understand you.0 comments2"

7,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Dec 2018Mm can consider rejecting on the basis of long term lock in periods and relative high cost of the plans as compared to DIY. On the side, I'll suggest that you learn how to invest on your own so that you can achieve better returns that what any wealth manage product can offer you. 0 comments1"
