I used to be very frugal and not from rich family and I only managed to save up around 12K+ during my uni days. Even if you get a 20% returns (highly unlikely), it is still only 2.4K a year, assuming you even have that money and will put every dollar in.The best investment is to invest in yourself, your studies, your career. To provide a perspective,depending on your grades and course of study, the difference in salary can be 1-2K that becomes 12-24K a year, much more than you can get out of investing currently. An advantage to investing now will be for financial literacy, so it is ok if you want to start early to familiarise yourself, but do spend more effort on your work. 0 comments0"

There are ways by which you can start with a small amount of money but first think about getting stronger in your core.There are penny stocks which are available at very cheap price and can be good to start with.1st investment in them and when you cross breakeven then move to small-cap, mid-cap stocksAlways go one step at time and small steps when you are beginner.0 comments0"

Can consider investing into Nikko AM STI ETF through POSB investsaver as an alternative. If you feel that you're still up for it, you can consider trading using Standard Charatered as it charges the lowest trading fees of $10 as compared to other banks/brokerages.
