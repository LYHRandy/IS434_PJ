God of WisdomAnswered on 29 Jan 2019After setting aside 6 months of your income as an emergency expense, I would recommend 2 methods to look at your asset allocation.1) Have your age as the % of your portfolio in bonds. So if you're 25, you should have a 75% Equity, 25% Bond Portfolio. You can easily set this up with an FA or a Robo advisory. Adjust every 5-10 years. Rebalance quarterly.2) Expected Rate Of Return. This method is for when you die die need the money to be used.Years to Requirement  รท 3 or 4 depending on your risk profile.E.g. If you need the money in 30 years for retirement for example. Your portfolio should be giving you 7.5%-10% in returns per annum. Thus, more equity heavy, try some alternative investments. But if you die die need the money in 10 years, then I would suggest only looking for 2.5-3.3% returns. Thus a bond heavy portfolio or endowment plans.0 comments0"

MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Keep emergency funds of at least 6 months' worth of salary:e.g 4,000 x 6 = 24,000Ensure you are sufficiently covered by insuranceInvest in equities:100 -  age = percentage in ETFs/roboadvisors (since you do not have sufficient time)Use multiplier accounts (OCBC360/DBS Mulitplier) or 'high' interest savings account (CIMB FastSaver). Remainder can be put into bonds such as SSB.2 comments0"
5,"Question Poster28 Jan 2019100 - age = percentage of the lump sum I assume? 

Also, DBS Multiplier accounts work better if you can hit all the category I assume? What if I am unable to hit all those category since I am still studying and not in the workforce yet.Lok Yang Teng28 Jan 2019For the ETF/roboadvisor, you can invest via monthly contribution so as to achieve dollar cost averaging. If you are still studying, you can consider POSB SAYE if you have not used it before."
