question,"Insurance Policies Asked by AnonymousAsked 1d agoDo insurance premiums cost more when the policy is bought through independent advisors?I am asking because the quotes I got seem to be higher than most people on forums (though I understand there may be factors, like my job, that affects the premium). Side note: I work in a clinic (relatively risk-free job). ANB 28, female, non-smoker.My IFA claims that his company doesn't charge for advice on insurance, he only earns when clients buy the policy. Does his commission come from the clients or from the insurer?Thanks in advance! :)2 answersAnswerBump0"

The quotation engines used to get a quote are standard regardless of who runs them (whether IFA or tied agent). Yes, there may be instances where the quote is higher due to job nature, but as you are working in a clinic, that should be pretty much a class 1 job (lowest risk) and your premiums would be standard. I do not know what quotes you received, but as an IFA myself if you need to have a set of quotes just to make sure of the numbers, you can let me know.Your IFA's claim is true. Comissions come from the insurer and are built into the policy already, along with other costs such as backend, support, staffing, etc.3 comments4"

Having said that, yes it is due to your job typing as a nurse, which is considered occupational class 3 (higher risk) for purposes of underwriting.Question Poster1d agoYeah, I was quoted even higher, albeit just slightly, for Aviva's IdealIncome. Haha. Thank you for the clarification! (:"

Be it from an IFA or a tied agent, assuming they are representing the same company, the premiums are the same. Of course, premiums also varies between the different insurance companies for a similar plan.With the information you have provided, your profile shouldnâ€™t attract higher premiums. That being said, again, it depends on what type of coverage and the amount of coverage you were looking for or proposed on. Commissions of advisers are paid from the insurer using the premiums paid by the clients.2 comments0"
