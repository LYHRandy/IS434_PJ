1,"Harvey TanLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 12 Aug 2019IShares MSCI World ETF (IWRD) cost about 0.5% p/a which is pretty expensive as compared to Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) which cost only 0.09% p/a. Appox. 5 times more expensive for IWRDHowever VT is domicilied and traded in the US hence you are subjected to 30% dividend witholding tax (DWT) as compared to 15% for IWRD, as IWRD is domicilied in Ireland and traded on LSE.
If I really have to pick one, I would go with IWRD since DWT is only 15% and you are looking for a dividend paying one. I would assume you would want to maximise your dividend payout.Note that both IWRD and VT has a pretty low exposure to China,which i believe is not a fair representation of a world ETF considering the influence that China has.
I would recommend you to supplement VT with a China ETF such as 2801.HK which is traded in Hong Kong. 2801.HK is priced very well. I believe it is around 20bps.
