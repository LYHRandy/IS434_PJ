“blessed are the stupid who can dream”Extremely smart but hopeless poor no matter what you do - that is an extremely depressing situation.0 comments2"

3,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 05 Apr 2019Filthy rich but stupid.I think while it is important to be smart, if there are no avenues/opportunities to utilise that intelligence, then that intellect is pretty much useless.On the other hand, like what Richard mentioned. the network that you get from being filthy rich may one way or another benefit you and compensate for your  lack of intelligence.0 comments0"
4,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Apr 2019Extremely smart but hopelessly poorIf you used your smartness the correct way such as by knowing how to work your way up to earn big bucks as well as managing your money well, i am sure you will eventually be able to be filthy rich as well. on the other hand, if you were to be filthy rich but utterly poor, it is likely that you will not know how to grow your money and control your spending and you may eventually end up being poor.0 comments0"
5,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Apr 2019Filthy Rich but stupid.I think if you're filthy rich, the amount of connections you will have in the world of the rich will benefit you more than being hopelessly poor but extremely smart. You wouldn't need look far for help if you have money and connections, but when you're poor, that would depend on other people's willingness to help you out that allows you to break through to the top.0 comments0"

Go to MINDS school or institute and see them. Even as grown ups they act like kids, play like kids without a WORRY in the world!!0 comments0"
7,"Billy Ko, President - Investment Club at Singapore Institute Of TechnologyLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Apr 2019If you're filthy rich but stupid, your riches will deplete (due to lack of knowledge in financial planning etc.) as opposed to someone who's extremely smart but hopelessly poor who might be really prudent and find ways to grow whatever limited wealth he/she has0 comments0"

The more stupid, the less worry. You would just enjoy life without a care in the world. So simple.If you're smart but so poor, you may not even have the chance to do anything with your intelligence. You'll be so frustrated all the time.0 comments0"
