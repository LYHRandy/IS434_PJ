1,"DeleteEditElijah Lee, Independent Financial Advisor at Phillip Securities (Jurong East Lite)Top Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered 2w agoHi anon, there are many options actually. If you have prepared your coverage and your emergency funds, you can start to look at the various asset classes to consider their pros and cons.Determine your own preference and risk appetite, and then decide what would suit you. A person adverse to risk might want to reduce or eliminate stocks completely, a person willing and able to take risk may skew the portfolio heavily in favour of stocks.What is important is to build a multi-asset portfolio with the flexibility to shift your allocation across the various asset classes in tandem with your evolving finances, age profile, risk appetites and lifestyle. Allocate your monies accordingly, add on regularly to your portfolio, and remember to monitor and rebalance. Prepare a warchest for market opportunities, and always stay focused. Grow your human capital as well so that you can have more funds to invest.As much as I would love to give a more detailed answer, your question is a little too general, but I hope the pointers will set you in the right direction.0 comments4"

God of WisdomAnswered 2w agoPay yourself first, and buy financial assets that provide you with a higher expected return than the current inflation rate.I suggest making sure you have 6 months of expenses set aside for emergencies, and then save a minimum of 20% of whatever you earn for retirement.Build a globally diversified portfolio with an asset mix that suits your risk profile, and invest regularly, rebalance yearly, and stay invested no matter what financial headlines may say.Investing is all about discipline, and asset allocation.2 comments1"
3,"Question Poster2w agoThanks for the advice, should this 20% then be placed in high interest bank acc / or be used as investment fund? Or there are other options?Hariz Arthur Maloy2w agoSave until your emergency fund is 'full' and then invest everything else after. But be sure to not invest any money you definitely require within 3 years."
4,"Vincent Tan Wen Bin, Assistant Vice President at Thinkers AllianceLevel 5. GeniusAnswered 2w agoGet yourself protected through insurance first. Hospital plan, Death and Early Critical Illness.Save at least 10% of your income to start building wealth. When you have at least 6-12 months worth of emergency funds start to channel the rest of the funds into investments with higher return If you are new, start with ETF, Funds or Robo.When you built up sufficient knowledge and find a great opportunity, invest it into stocks.
This is my opinion on how one should structure their basic retirement planning.0 comments0"
