2,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 16 May 2019I wouldn't. Personally I don't have that many items to sell, so if someone is looking for what I have to sell, they would find it via the search bar already.0 comments1"

It just like letting carousell draw a portion of your profit from the item that you sell.It also look no point to pay an amount to put your item in the front listing, if your item is popular that many people will search for it. To me it is just tactic for carousell to survive.0 comments1"
