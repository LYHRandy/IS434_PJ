3-5X Annual Income as Critical Illness CoverageDPS is a term to 60 death cover for $46,000. That's it.Also, you need to understand what you purchased from Prudential. Is it health insurance? This is called PruShield. This covers your hospitalization and surgical bills if you were to get warded.The only other insurance programs you can pay for with CPF, is your Home Protection Scheme, which is a mortgage reducing term plan once you purchased a HDB.Careshield Life when you turn 30. This is a long term care plan that pays you a monthly payout for life in the event of permanent disability not allowing you to perform 3 out of 6 Activities Of Daily Living. And lastly, CPF Life, which is a lifetime annuity that pays you a monthly sum from 65 for the rest of your life as long as you set aside a Retirement Sum. 0 comments2"
