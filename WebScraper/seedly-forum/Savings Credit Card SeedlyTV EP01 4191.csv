1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 18 May 2019I currently have my Citi Maxigain savings account topped up to 100k (because beyond 150k, you don't avail the step-up interest of 2%). Currently that gives me the best interest rates with no hassle of minimum spending etc.For the rest, I use Standard Chartered Bonus Savers account (but am not liking the minimum card spend etc BUT this gives you the bonus with salary creditting), and the rest I have in CIMB for all the rest of it.0 comments1"
