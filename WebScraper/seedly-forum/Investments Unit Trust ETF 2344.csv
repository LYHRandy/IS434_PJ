God of WisdomAnswered on 10 Mar 2019Just a little correction on Zann's answer:There are actively managed ETFs, and passively managed UTs as well. The main difference is that UTs are open ended (always open to new subscriptions) and ETFs are closed ended (bought and sold between holders of the ETF, and initial units were created during IPO).0 comments0"
2,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Mar 2019Hello!Unit trusts  are usually actively managed by professional fund managers , while ETFs  are passively managed and trade on a stock exchange.Unit trusts typically invests in a range of assets which means your risks are diversified. If one particular asset doesn't perform as well, the gains from other assets could offset any losses. While for ETFs, it tracks a stock index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets.
Hope this helps!0 comments0"
