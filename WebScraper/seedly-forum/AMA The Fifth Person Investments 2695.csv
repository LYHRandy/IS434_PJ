1,"Isaac ChanLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 20 Feb 2019Like the others have mentioned, PE ratio is a useful multiple commonly utilised by most investors. But I would suggest you look at the PEG multiple too.PEG stands for P/E divided by Earnings Per Share Growth over a period of time. The PEG ratio takes into account not just how much a share is worth relative to its earnings (definition of PE), but also its growth rate, since growth also affects a share's value. In essence, a firm's PE should be positively correlated to the EPS growth rate. The higher the EPS growth rate, the higher the PE multiple you will be paying. The PEG multiple can help us decide what shares are over or undervalued. If the PEG multiple is low, this means that a company's EPS is growing faster relative to its PE, which means that the market may be undervaluing this share (since higher EPS growth rate should lead to higher PE). The converse can also be true, where the company's EPS growth rate is low but the market still values the company's share highly which leads it to a higher PEG. Such shares are then considered overvalued.Like others have mentioned, you need to pay attention to whether EPS growth that the multiples are trading on are trailing (historical) or forward (prospective)0 comments1"
2,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 20 Feb 2019P/E ratio is one of the most commonly used ratios for assessing company's stock against its EPS- popularised due to its ease of calculation. Ultimately every investor wishes for his invested company to grow its earnings. Though a high P/E ratio might signal a stock is overvalued, it also shows investors are willing to pay a higher premium for the stock- meaning they expect growth in earnings in coming quarters/year. Therefore, growth stocks often trade at high P/E ratios and should be compared to similar growth companies in the same industry for best reference.Likewise, value stocks tend to trade at low P/E ratios, and while value investors see obvious discount- never forget the market might have reason to justify its low prices. Forecast of future earnings might be doubted or expected to drop(esp if its in a sunset industry).Traders nowadays also look at forward P/E and trailing P/E multiples especially for growth stocks to better determine whether its overvalued or a good time to buy in.0 comments1"

It can also be used to help to compare the company itself relative to its history.  It will help to see how much an investor should invest in order to receive a dollar od the company's earnings. It can also help to determine the market value of a stock compared to the earnings of the company. If the PE value is high, it means that the stock price is high relative to earnings and could mean that it is overvalued. 0 comments1"
