1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Oct 2018How big is your risk appetite, or how knowledgeable are you about investments? Of you are new to investing and don't want to manage anything on your own, consider Singapore savings bonds or even investing via robo advisories. You can select a portfolio based on your risk appetite for the latter. If you are willing to spend to learn an investing skill, consider paying to attend a workshop on learning how to manage an options portfolio. You can learn how to make money even when you are wrong about your selected stock. I'm personally using this instrument to fund my retirement in a few years. Hope this helps 0 comments0"
