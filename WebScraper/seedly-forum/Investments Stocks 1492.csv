1,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Apr 2019Singapore is honestly too small of a market for most technology firms to be concerned about. There are alot of apps/food/brands that caught on overseas and never in Singapore but are doing extremely well on the global stage as a whole.If we think from the company perspective that resources are limited, would the company channel more efforts in targeting our little island country or select a country with much higher population0 comments0"
