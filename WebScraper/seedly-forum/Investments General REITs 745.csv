1,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 10 Jul 2019There are a few scenarios for shareholders. But please do take action before 3 Oct 2019.
If you want, you can request for transfer of shares from CDP to the Hong Kong's share depository. Then you can continue trading the shares on Hong Kong Exchange.Else, you might want to consider selling before the last trading day in SG.If you DO NOT do anything, you will receive PAPER share certificates from Hong Kong. This is the worst situation you want to be in. Because then you will need to open a brokerage account in Hong Kong to deposit the paper certificates.1 comment1"
