3,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Sep 2018I invested in NIKKO AM POSB INVESTREADY back in december last year. It was my mistake for not checking the fund's holdings properly before. The price just went downhill since then. Later on, I transferred to NIKKO AM SINGAPORE STI ETF which was/is doing much better. There are many different options available, just have to do your research thoroughly before investing.Pros: you can invest with just $100 monthly and over time there will be dollar-cost averaging.Cons: You can't control the fund's holdings and portfolio.0 comments0"
