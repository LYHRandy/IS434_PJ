It's easier to get the 1.8% and up. You wouldn't need to change the account your salary is credited to either and only $1  needed from your credit spend monthly as long as you meet the monthly transaction requirements.This is just my opinion as someone using the multiplier account.0 comments0"

RookieAnswered on 13 Aug 2019OCBC 360 is good if you are able to fulfil their requirements for bonus interest, plus IMO their ibanking interface is the best, particularly because of their Savings Goals feature which helps you compartmentalize and automate your savings.I have no experience with Multiplier so I can't comment on that :)0 comments0"
