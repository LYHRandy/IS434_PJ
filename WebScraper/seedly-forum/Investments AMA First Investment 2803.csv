1,"Isaac ChanLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 12 Feb 2019Hi there! The answers given by the others are good and comprehensive But I would perhaps like to stress a point that the others might not have stressed yet, and that is, the learning of the fundamentals of any investment product. Yes, it is important to understand how REITs, bonds, and FX trading operates, but ultimately, it would be very helpful to understand what underlying factors affect the investment product you are looking at. Is it central bank interest rates? Is it a company’s earnings? Is it the trade war between US and China? Understanding how the investment products are affected by their fundamentals finally helps you to understand what kind of investment decisions to make, such as buying and selling, and how long to hold the products. Investment products, though are represented by numbers, are finally affected by real world events and happenings, and trying to understand what factors influence them is crucial. This also helps you to guard against panic buying and selling, and cautions you on being influenced by the herd mentality (“im going to buy this share because everyone seems to be buying it”)Such a learning task may seem daunting at first, but there are plenty of resources online, such as the website Investopedia, which offers some interesting insights into different asset classes. Perhaps focus on learning one asset class at a time, instead of rushing and feeling overwhelmed. Going head first and just buying and selling without much thinking is more akin to gambling than investing!0 comments1"

6,"Leong Wen Fong, Community Lead at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hello! Not an expert here, but from my time in the community, I do often hear a few things:Have you saved up enough to start investing?WHy I'm covering something so basic, is because many who want to start investing don't think of this step before jumping in. Not only does this help to ensure you have food on the table for the next few months at least, it also helps you with your investing mindset- imagine if you don't have money beyond your investment, the way you react to things will be much more emotionally driven.Many here recommend at least 6 months of your monthly expensesAre you investing for the short term or long term?Depending on what you are going for, it will determine what instruments you use (bonds, REITs, etc) and what method to do the investment (DCA, one-time)But the idea is to diversify and spread your risk throughout your portfolio.If you want to find out more, you can read the many articles on Seedly blog!1 comment0"

9,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I'd say understanding yourself and how you handle money is a good first step on the investment journey. Can you take a paper loss in your account, or are you the type who can see red without batting an eyelid. This will allow you to determine your risk profile type and the type of investment instruments that are suitable for you. For self help, you can read up on books like the intelligent investor, millionaire teacher or money: master the game. Or if you are inclined, pay to learn from a mentor via an investment workshop. This may potentially allow access to an established investment system which you can then use. In general, if you want to start small on your own 
, you can use platforms like posb's invest saver programme or maybank ke's monthly investment plan to start investing with $100 per month into the STI Etf or a bond fund or into a list of individual stocks. Robo advisories like smartly or stashaway will also allow small investments. Hope this helps 4 comments0"

But are there any significant differentiators? Ie the fees, the guidance..Jonathan Chia Guangrong12 Feb 2019Hi Shann. For robo advisories, basically you are buying into their respective investment philosophies and how they set up their portfolios for each risk profile. From what I understand of their fee structure, they will charge a certain percentage (e.g. Stashaway charges 0.8% of your account size for the first S$25,000, and it gets cheaper the larger your account is). Pros is that the portfolio will fit your risk profile based on the questions asked, and it's really a hands off way of investing, not to mention the relatively low cost compared to something else like unit trusts. Cons wis... (more)"
