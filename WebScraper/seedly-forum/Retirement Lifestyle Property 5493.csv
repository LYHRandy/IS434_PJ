2,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 08 May 2019This a really specific question. I would assume the two cats have a significant role in your life. Considering your options, ideally, you do not necessarily have to choose either or.If you are able to live comfortably whilst supporting the cats and housing loan, you can keep your status quo. However if you're intending to retire soon or unable to work or that you'll have difficulty paying back the loan in the future, you may have to forgo one of them.0 comments0"
