1,"Apple TayLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 14 Aug 2019I am a property investor, I will never invest in an asset with no title deeds at that kind of price. It may give you 8-10 percent return but letâ€™s say I ask you to give me 100k then pay you back slowly but what are you left with .... a tiny asset ? Can you resell it? Does it appreciate in calue like any property?0 comments0"
