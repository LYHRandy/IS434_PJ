question,"Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 19 Aug 2019Has anyone heard of Lecun (bitcon platform) before?I came across this bitcoin platform recently, and its promised returns of 0.5% daily with an investment of >10k USD. Sounds like a great rate of return and I can just come out quickly once the 60-day probation period ends. However, not sure what it's all about and how it works exactly, so if anyone can advise that'd be great!1 answerAnswerBump0"
