1,"Hao Yu, Advisory Specialist at MoneyOwlLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Dear anonymous, thank you for your suggestions. On your request to show percentage return of your portfolio instead of just showing the dollar amount gained or lost, we are pleased to let you know that we are currently working on it and you will soon be able to see it. On the projected estimate graph, you will remember that just before you open your account to invest your money, we showed a graph that gave the best, median and worst return that can be achieved by your portfolio 75% of the time over your investment period. However, on a short term basis, market sentiments may make your portfolio behave in a way that is different from the long term returns projection. This can sometimes cause panic or over exuberance and influence investor behaviour, something we at MoneyOwl discourage. This was why we hesitated showing this number. But we hear you and we will look at how best we can track your portfolio current performance versus its long-term projection. But If you have any concerns and wish to discuss your current portfolio, you know you can contact us at enquiries@moneyowl.com.sgThank you once again for your suggestions.2 comments11"
2,"Question Poster20 May 2019Thank you for the reply, Hao Yu! Very grateful and happy to know that  we will be able to see the gains/loss percentage soon. 

As for the projected estimate graph, it is fine if it is not implemented. At first, i only wanted to look at the graph daily to remind myself to ALWAYS invest using DCA method every month as a motivation regardless of price/news/fluctuations and also keep spare cash for when the market turn favorable (crash, buy more) but i know it ... (more)Hao Yu20 May 2019You are welcome! Glad to be able to answer your questions. To keep yourself discipline and DCA regularly, I would suggest that you set up a standing instruction on your online banking platform. This will make sure that you stick to your plan to DCA monthly.
