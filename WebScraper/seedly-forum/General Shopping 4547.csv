3,"Ham DominicLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 22 Sep 2018To shop at Taobao, the most important thing is to be able to find the things you need. If you want to be able to browse and find the items yourself, www.taobaotranslate.com can help you find items you want. There are also guides there that can help you set up Taobao account, shipping from Taobao etc0 comments3"
4,"Jolene TanLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 27 Jun 2019Some hacks that have helped me:Image search keyword search: Upload an image of what you're searching for (this article talks about it in detail). Taobao will churn out a bunch of similar items. Afterwhich, you can dissect the product names -- isolate key phrases and search them, so you'd be able to get a more accurate results for what you want! (imo this works much better than Google translate)Clothes sizing: If you still feel uncertain with regards to sizing, you can actually chat with the merchant and tell them your height & weight - they'll revert with the appropriate size for the specific item you're looking at.Sale seasons (11.11, 12.12, 6.18): A tip from locals is to only buy branded items during sale seasons - reason being that other stores would mark up their items before applying sales discounts. I'm not 100% sure about this but it wouldn't hurt to track the prices of items you're eyeing!0 comments1"
