2,"Jacob Chong, Executive Financial Advisor at PIASLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 30 Jan 2019Hmm.... Honestly I am very intrigue by their so call 0 downpayment and owning all the 34 properties without any cash down payment. I have been in the Banking industry long enough to know where they are going on with the scheme of theirs. Lets take things into prespective:Legally, if you are to own another property (investment) you will be subjected to ABSD of 12%, Legal Fee, and what have you, of about 15% in total... That's to the Government. Now after securing your so call investment property, you have mortgage to take note, Maintence fee, rental, Property Tax, insurance etc.... I have seen people doing de-coupling of properties so as to escape the ABSD, then what about the legal fee and the rest.... (In the end, its the lawyer, the bank and the Agent most of all the earns the most) not you. Think about it, when you have no financial means to pay the mortgages who is being sued? Bank takes back the property (no lost)Lawyer wash their hands off, because they are only doing the conveyance (money already collected)Agents earned their comm and now long gone (again money collected)You? Charged for bankrupcy because you should have known better about your finances. The funny thing about all these that I have mentioned there are still people in Singapore wanting to buy up property for retirement, for captial gain. When these ads comes up in FB or any social media many rushes in to see and roped into it.
A 1million property (which is very rare now) would cost you to lose 15% to the Government. Thats a Whooping 150k. How then can you make back this 15% initial Loss in a matter of 2 years, 3 years or even 5 years.... Foreigner you say? Foreginers will make up for that 15% lost you made. Statistically, you will know you are just trying to comfort yourself. Government has already limited the number of Foreigners into Singapore, and looking that the tax that they are paying i doubt so.What they are trying to make up is a Private investment scheme to properties under many co-owners pulling funds and resources together and since you have a miserable 5% share of the subject property you are considered as OWNED A PROPERTY. I don't know about you but i will Definetly GIVE this A BIG MISS. When Sh**s hits the Fence, you know those gurus that say they are just teaching Singaporean how to own 34 properties for free(trust me they get kick backs from lawyers, agents, developers there is no such thing as free) are already long gone and there isn't a think you could do to them because they are not regulated. 0 comments11"
3,"Kenneth FongLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 27 Jan 2019Hi anonymous, that's a great question and one which was talked about in a recent article here (if you'd like to read more).From a property investor's perspective, here are some key concerns:What're the consequences if fellow co-owners don’t pay up (especially if loans are involved)?How are you going to evaluate the competence of the manager(s) in chargeHow easy is it for you to sell your share?Is there such a thing as guaranteed rental rates? (Hint: there isn't)This kinda sounds like buying a REIT, but does it carry any 'unnecessary' level of risk?As Jimmy Lim stated, I highly doubt that this I Quadrant venture is MAS approved. And as is with all investment instruments (especially those that sound too good to be true), always do your due diligence!0 comments7"

Grand MasterUpdated on 10 Sep 2019Its definitely not MAS approved, not saying that is a scam, but MAS does not need to approve every single business.I would not say its a scam, but its definitely a lot less possible that what they made it up to be. Generally their proposal is closer to an informal REITS among the participants. So why not buy REITS instead of forming your own ""reits"" with other participants?Because that can NOT be packaged and sold in a $2997 course. =)Its more emotionally and prideful for participants to say ""I own 34 properties"" than to tell people, i have money in a few big REITS thats enough for me to retire with real passive income, no effort, tax-free income, no worries on big economic downturn or bank loan squeeze, and hassle-free investment thatI started in my youth with a couple of hundreds.Sidenote: I know of at least 2 experienced investors who went bankrupt during 1997. They too were living the dreams back then, leveraging on bank loans and buying condos, industrial properties. Good money.Once the economy started south, bank will squeeze the rates higher, or ask for top ups to maintain the loan ratio, then you can't sell or rent out because everyone are desperate and then boom!If you really like properties returns (I will say stock or ETF returns are better than properties) then go for a few REITS. You will be thankful when crisis hits.if you can't remember 1997 because you are too young, then thats what the course sellers want.2 comments6"

6,"Yeap Ming Feng, Head of Content & SEO at SeedlyLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019If you have been seeing a lot of such ads around which got you interested, there might be a few things you wish to take note of.A good article to shed some light on this heavily advertised property investing scheme can be found here: https://blog.seedly.sg/own-x-properties-in-2-years-with-no-money-down-is-it-a-scam/I will just do a quick summary on this:Technically, it is not a scam or anything. It is just an area where there are lesser rules and regulations with regards to this. Lots of legal grea area and MAS has yet to step in.You are looking at co-owning commercial properties, as there is no ABSD, and also, it can be rented out for higher yield. However, do note that, you do not technically own them, since you do not have the ""keys"" to these properties.There is little idea on what will happen to your investments should the company cease to exist. Unlike REITs that are traded on the exchange, whatever measures they have in place may lack the necessary foundation with regards to ""tanking"" investors' loss.I am not an expert in this subject matter. Definitely keen to hear different point of views!2 comments4"

8,"Lim Chun Long Jimmy, Distributor at Newbrand Organic Green TeaLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 27 Jan 2019It is never MAS regulated as MAS does not regulate real estate investments. The regulator that would concern this is the Council for Estate Agencies. You may try raising your concerns to them about the I Quadrant's Facebook advertisement.Given a choice, I would rather own and rent out 34 fine arts with money down, and I won't have loan repayments and stamp duties to worry about.0 comments3"

11,"OwhthinkngrowLevel 2. RookieAnswered 1d agoI find that their advertisement is creative and misleading to me. I mean that's good marketing but not good for viewers like me because they are very misleading. Why misleading? 
The first question i wanted to ask them is, who owned the 34 properties? Then followed by this question --> 100% ownership? Or shared among people? How much is little money? No money meaning just take loan? 20% pay by someone else?For me, if the course is teaching single person to fully own the property with little or no money down. Then I’m interested. But is it possible? Think about it.If u don't fully own the properties, and they are shared among a group of people, then the income is shared among the group of people. You are left with peanuts after distributing the money. I believe MAS has nothing to do with educators like themselves. Unless they start to sell investment related products.The risk is the course fee that you are going to pay, if you do attend the course.My personal insight on property investment, just some pointers for you to think about: 1) If you are interested in property investment, read up on properties related stuff, talk to property agents or attend a few free seminars related to properties. Usually they will share some information which you might not be aware of. 2) Singapore properties are mainly categorized under Residential, Industrial and commercial properties. Find out these 3 categories and their rules for buying/selling them. Then you will see some light as to what kind of properties you can invest in. 2) Singapore law on buying properties is kind of fixed. Trying to abuse the system? I don't think so. So I believe someone has to come out with the cash to pay for downpayment, someone has to take loan. You just cannot escape this part. So are you capable of paying the downpayment and taking the loan? If you can't, then what's the next possible solution? Group buy? Be creative.3) Property investment involves a lot more money than buying groceries, so calculation is definitely important. If you are not sure where or how to start your calculation, ask a few property agents, or google about it. Once you know your numbers, looking for properties will be much easier as you have your criterias. You can Google on property tools and related stuff that can help you to find properties easily. There are such tools online. 4) Gain more knowledge by reading more. The more you know, the lesser the investment risk. 5) Take action. Most of the information that you need is available to you for free. There are some information that would require some subscription fees. Before u pay for any courses out there, just make sure that they are going to teach what you want to learn. This is important, because most of time, what u receive in the course is not what u expect. If you do attend their course, I believe you are just paying them for their effort to gather the information and share it with you during the course. They are just more hardworking that most people.0 comments1"
12,"Angeline TeoLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 16 Sep 2019Yes, it is possible. Is it easy? absolutely not.There are a lot of legal ways to obtain bank loans and maximise your leverage. Properties can be in companies' names with proper backing and cashflow. You can split properties between couples. You can split between parents and kids.End of the day, its about leverage and finding. If you are determined, you can find it via your own way or an experienced property agent.However, do you really want that? Leverage means extra profits.... and extra risks. If there is some bad sentiment on properties, the damage to you would be leveraged too.All these skillsets are a doubled-edged sword. Even when you possess it, you ought to be careful. only use your leverage when your downside is limited and the upside is big.Property is a long term story!0 comments1"

21,"Danielle ArlingtonLevel 1. FreshieAnswered 6d agoThis couple is a total scam.
They did not lose 1.3 million. They STOLE 4 million from their former employer- a very famous IT solutions provider called Commgate: https://e27.co/commgate-working-spring-singapore-help-retailers-go-online-20170707/There is a police investigation right now, as they forged a bunch of ICV grants to claim money from the government.They then used this stolen money to buy their 34 properties.2 comments0"

I will know that Commgate have gotten a huge project from Spring Singapore because I was the lead and point of contact to help Commgate secure that partnership. Although it is also one of my greatest regret for wasting Spring's time since even after securing such a huge project, my ex-ceo actually still lead the company to its downfall after he had kicked me out of the company once the project was secured.

23,"Murdoch Gabriel Level 1. FreshieAnswered on 05 Sep 2019When it's too good to be true.  Think again...  But is it possible to have so many properties in 2 years?  Yes, u can... Its call flipping.   However, I do not suggest do it in SG as the market quite small.  You can consider developing countries like the Philippines or Vietnam or Cambodia.   However its all at ur own risk so please do ur due diligence.  I do have 10 units in the Philippines...   This is after months of background checks, research and I even made a trip down to see as well.   Wishing all the best.1 comment0"
