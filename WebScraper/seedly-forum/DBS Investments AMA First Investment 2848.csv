Basically your Srs account can be linked to any local broker platform that allows Srs to be used for payment. With regards to what you can invest with it, it'll depend on what you are looking for and your risk appetite. Depending on the stock counter, Srs funds may be used. Alternatively, stashaway now allows you to invest using your Srs account. You can create a portfolio on their platform based on your risk profile and go from there. Hope this helps 0 comments0"
