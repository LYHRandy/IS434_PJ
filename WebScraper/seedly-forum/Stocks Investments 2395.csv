1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Mar 2019I think many people are buying into stocks with exposure and businesses in China and riding with the momentum. This- I have no problem with, but I would caution against buying into an overly rosy economic outlook for China or even globally. Indeed from this recent article, we see the worst is not over for China's export and import markets in coming periods.Going back to the question. As a value investor, I would refrain from doing so, unless of course the valuation multiples or intrinsic value is still extremely attractive. I think it is also important to contrast between top line growth(revenue growth) and bottom line growth(net income), whether these overseas ventures can successfully translate into bottom line growth for the company in the coming quarters.0 comments0"
