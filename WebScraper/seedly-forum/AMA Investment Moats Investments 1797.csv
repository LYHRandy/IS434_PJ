1,"Ng Lip Hong Kyith, Computing at National University of SingaporeLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 21 Aug 2018Hi I think when it comes to evaluating REITs it's like how I would evaluate most business: the basis of good business, bad business, good Management decisions and poor management decisions, attractive and less than attractive value If I were to summarize:1) analyze the nature of the assets, the level of leverage, nature of the leverage
2) analyze the sub property markets going forward. Is it better or worse. This determines the growth rate of your reit
3) analyze the ability of the management. When prospecting a reit, read through all the announcement of acquisitions, divestments, refinancing of debts. Then see whether on hindsight, these turn out to be good or poor decisions. This let's you know the nature of the manager
4) valuation. This consolidate the work in #1 to #3 to determine what price would u pay for this business. Compare the dividend yield and growth versus the historical.if you go to read some analyst report, they will show for example the dividend yield of starhill global reit since ipo or the dividend yield minus 10 year government bond rate.I write more of this in this article http://investmentmoats.com/money-management/reit/reits-considerations-picking-reits-to-purchase-buy-and-hold-speculation/0 comments1"

RookieAnswered on 06 Apr 2019In summary, some of the key things to look at includes type of business (who are they leasing too and future tenants business prospects), weighted average lease expiry, net asset value, price to book, ebit to interest expense ratio and current dividend yield plus the sustainability of it. Oh and tenant concentration and pb ratio is important too.0 comments0"
