I can tell you immediately that in terms of working capital, a loan works better than a VC investment. Loan structures depend on what type of loan you are seeking, and the interest rate would likely be determined only aft the risk assessment has been done on your company.I cannot give you a definite answer on this, but if you want to know more, you can drop me a message, as I am currently handling all the e-commerce loans from my company. alternatively, if you want to check things out on your own, head over here!0 comments0"
