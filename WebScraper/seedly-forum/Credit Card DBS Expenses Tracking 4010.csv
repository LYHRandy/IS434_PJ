question,"Credit Card DBS Expenses Tracking Asked by AnonymousAsked on 07 Aug 2019What alternative to Seedly do you use to track your expenses/rewards for your DBS credit cards?Since they don't support DBS bank anymore, anyone got any alternatives to tracking your expenses and rewards from DBS? I'm open to manual systems too (e.g. tracking on Excel etc.)2 answersAnswerBump3"

1,"PatLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 27 Aug 2019Use Excel and the DBS Lifestyle app in tandem. What I like about the app is that it shows you how much you charged to each card on each date to which merchant (with a slight delay of 2-3 days). Also, there are promotions which you can join (e.g. grocery, dining) to earn rewards. If your card is eligible for DBS points ($5 = 1 point), the points are shown clearly once you log in and you can offset bills with that. Use your Excel to track total expenses (+breakdown) and maybe a short table on the miles/points/rebates which each card has so you can easily refer to it. Hope this helps!0 comments1"

WonderkidAnswered on 27 Aug 2019For me, I just manually enter everything into the Seedly app. It's more convenient for me to enter the cost on the spot so I don't forget.I got around the 2-3 day waiting time by changing the speed required for SMS notification to $1. You won't get the notification for recurrent payment though (eg insurance, bills) so you still need one of the DBS apps to confirm every week or so.0 comments0"
