WonderkidAnswered on 18 Mar 2019I paid my annual insurance premiums through two channels.Charges to my UOB ONE card via Cardup platform to meet the minimum spendings of S$500 under UOB ONE account. This would allow me to earn the UOB ONE Card cashback of S$50 per quarter (note 5 transactions per month required) and UOB ONE account monthly interest of S$130+. You will however need to incur an fee of 2.6% for each transaction made under Cardup (eg, S$13) but you still profits at the end of day.Charges to OCBC Cashflo Credit card via AXS to meet the S$500 minimum spendings under OCBC 360 Account. With S$3000 being split into 6 months instalment, this would earn me close to S$30 per month under the saving account. Note there is no rebates under credit card and no additional charges incur.0 comments4"
