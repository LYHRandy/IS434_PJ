Hope this will help.​It idepends on the tours that you've done.If you have been in the weapons community, the chances of finding a relevant job with min paycut is close to none. If you have been doing HQ work like strat plan, logistic planning, you can use it to prove that it's an transferable skill.If you've been doing HR work, then you can look into HR roles.​All in all, SAF Officers are much like Project Management, with the massive primary, secondary appointments that you all hold, you can describe it till that you can juggle many things at one go, good at multi taskings. That is also a valuable asset.​0 comments1"

WizardAnswered on 25 May 2018Depends on your skill set and since you got an engineering degree, there should be demand for it.​As an officer, you also have an advantage when applying for a managerial position or team lead position.​Aside from that, not much advice I can give except to look through career portals to find out if there are any positions suited to your skillset​https://www.jobstreet.com.sg/0 comments1"
5,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 30 Nov 2018Think carefully if you really want to leave the service. You may have to suffer a pay cut to enter a new industry, especially so if your skills set are not transferable. Just my humble opinion. 0 comments0"
