1,"Vikas JainLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 13 Jul 2018Thanks for your question! We’ve addressed it during the event, but sharing the details here to benefit the Seedly community members who may not have attended the event :slightly_smiling_face: When a company with debts declares bankrupt, the official assignee will prioritise the debt claims based on the seniority of the debt. Usually loans backed by collateral (secured loans) are considered senior to the unsecured debts (without any collateral). From an investor’s perspective secured debts like property backed loans are therefore lower in terms of returns compared to unsecured business term loans.0 comments1"
