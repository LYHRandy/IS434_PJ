MasterAnswered on 22 Sep 2018I would recommend the DBS multiplier. using a joint account would make it such that both of you get to earn more interest! you can check out how here: http://thefinance.sg/2018/04/16/dbs-multiplier-ssbs-joint-account-higher-interest/Upvote me if i helped! thanks!! :)0 comments0
2,"Amanda Ho, Financial Planner at AXALevel 2. RookieAnswered on 21 Sep 2018Hi there, would recommend getting a savings plan or an investment plan to growth your wealth. Savings plans are at (3% interest) and investment plans can have interest as high as 10% or higher. If you're interested you can PM me, i might be able to recommend you something you need and add value to you. Disclaimer, i'm not an insurance agent.  0 comments0"
3,"Steph YeoLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 08 Jun 2018 I'll answer your second qn-- there's no  strict yes/no answer when it comes to joint account. But its definitely convenient when you need to account for your ""couple"" type of transactions. If your partner is ok with a joint account to park  that 100k, then go ahead (:0 comments0"
4,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 24 May 2018Definitely the CIMB FastSaver which gives you the best flat rate interest at 1% p.a and it is also liquid (ie you can withdraw the amount any time)​You can read the real user reviews here to understand why also: https://seedly.sg/reviews/savings-accounts/cimb-fast-saver​A very simple to use savings account. Designed for the person who is just keen to save up and earn 1% up to the first $50k. Also, many people may not know but actually it is SDIC $50k insured and the CIMB Clicks Online interface is not too shabby as well! Online approval is quick.0 comments0"
