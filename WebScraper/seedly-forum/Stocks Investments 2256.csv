1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 13 Mar 2019I think it would be trying to read and understand as much of the company as possible. One of Warren Buffet's top tip is to read as much as you can, even reading up to 500 pages a day. He believes that reading is like compound interest, which builds up over time. Once you know much more about the company or industry, the assumptions you use for your valuation methodologies would be much easier to justify and ascertain. Valuation here is both art and a science.0 comments1"
