1,"Jonathan NgLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 16 May 2019Hello!TD Ameritrade is an online brokerage which you can use to trade stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, options, futures, forex, foreign ADRs & IPOs. This large investment selection also comes with free indepedent research, their high-quality trading platform thinkorswim, good customer support, as well as, no account minimum. However, in exchange, they charge a higher trade commission than other brokers at $6.95/stock trade & $7.70/contract for options. So you can weigh whether the brokerage platform and services they offer matches the high cost they charge!With that said, you are able to purchase the index and stocks you have mentioned with TD Ameritrade.Alternatively, you can also refer to this stock brokerage comparision that Seedly did:  https://blog.seedly.sg/the-ultimate-cheatsheet-cheapest-stock-brokerage-in-singapore/ Hope it helps!0 comments1"

Use it to trade options mainly and the occasional stock. Great platform, relatively easy to use and there's a great charting tool as well. I'm paying $5 minimum for stock and $1 per option contract as I have a group rate under my community.0 comments0"

Let me know if you need a referral code ;)0 comments0"
