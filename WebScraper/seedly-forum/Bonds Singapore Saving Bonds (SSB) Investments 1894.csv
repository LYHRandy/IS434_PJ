1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Low risk, low returns.There isn't another product in the market that gives a higher return for the same risk taken as the SSB. You should ask if you would like them in your overall portfolio instead of looking at them individually.Markets up or down, you'll still get your coupons and your capital at the end of 10 years.2 comments4"
2,"Linda Tan01 Apr 2019I see! thanks again for the answer Hariz. Do you know if there are other bonds that I can compare SSBs with?Hariz Arthur Maloy01 Apr 2019US Treasuries. But then you take on currency risk. You can also try investment grade quasi sovereign bonds, like Temasek."

WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019It’ll depend on what is your end goal to your investments, if you’re looking at hedgling against inflation, then SSBs is probably one of the best ways to hedge against inflation. However do note that bonds in general is like lending people money for a period of time  and you get compensated with regular interest rate. It’s is not something that will grow over time like businesses or REITS or ETFs. It’s like a coupon that allows you to claim your money back after a period of time.if you’re looking to grow your money, then setting aside a small portion of your money into bonds so that you have your back covered then you can proceed to grow your money with the other investment instruments out there.Wishing you a wonderful investing journey ahead!1 comment2"

ProdigyAnswered on 01 Apr 2019Hi Linda,I've this simple formula on the SSB which is a WAG formula.W - withdrawal: No lock in periodA - anyone : Anyone with the right accounts can buyG - guaranteed: Principal and interest guaranteed.If you understand it, you'd realise SSB is a unique solution for savings and getting interest without risk.  My full video on it is here.The T2023-S$ 5-year Temasek Bond and Astrea IV bond are closer comparison to the SSB. All other retail bonds listed on the market (like the SIA retail bond) may carry a better yield but are not principal guaranteed by the government.0 comments0"
