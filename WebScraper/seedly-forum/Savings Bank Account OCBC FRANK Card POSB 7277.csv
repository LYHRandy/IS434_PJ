Definitely get that savings account that gives you higher interest with salary crediting.Since you are just starting and have 0 savings, maybe not the best time to do the minimum spend game if you need to spend extra to spend that minimum spend to hit the higher interest tier. Now on to 3:Start looking up the various investment options - get educated and look to build up your emergency fund, then investment capital. Bank accounts can only get you so far, but yes, it's on the tail end of the risk-reward spectrum.Of course, another way to increase savings is to increase income. As you are just starting, learn as much as you can and grow as an individual.0 comments4"

WonderkidAnswered 4w agoWelcome to adulting, to answer your questions regarding your cards, I feel that if there is no use for it, its better you consolidate your savings account so that you won't have to manage so many accounts. 1 savings account to enjoy the interest when you credit your salary and another account for your expense is enough.Now start off with choosing a high savings account is definitely the easiest way to take the first step out towards managing your money. Subsequently, you can start thinking about paying off high interest debts like student loans or any other loans that will eat into your savings.Next, ensure you’re sufficiently covered in your insurance so that you can safeguard your savings from any unexpected events. Lastly, make your savings work harder for you by learning how to invest in the many assets class to start growing your money and you’re on your way.The analogy of comparing your bank account to a water tub is one of the easiest ways to understand how to manage your money. Start by opening the water tap, make sure to find a tub, plug out all the leaking holes and you’re well on your way.0 comments1"

Then open dbs multiplier and credit your salary over and spend money there. Use it as a spending account. Every month set up a recurring transfer of 10% of salary to your saving account.4 comments1

Do check which one you love (and suits your lifestyle)Standard Chartered JumpStart AccountCIMB FastSaver accountOCBC 360 accountDBS multiplier accountUOB One AccountYou will probably love DBS or OCBC for the salary crediting. If you want to research more, you can check out Maybank or CIMB saving accounts for a slightly higher interest rate.For spending, I think FRANK is good for internet purchases. Go for a general cash-back card while you figure out in the future what specific cashback card or Miles credit card you like.For a general credit card cashback, I will say OCBC 365 or Standard Chartered Cashback is good to use3 comments1"
