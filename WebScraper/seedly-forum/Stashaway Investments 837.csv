question,Stashaway Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 09 Jul 2019Will stashaway allow us to credit the dividends gain directly into our bank instead of reinvesting it?I understand that now they are reinvesting our dividends. Is there a possibility of recieving the dividends as cash when we choose to stop reinvesting it?1 answerAnswerBump3

1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 10 Jul 2019Hi anon! As far as I have been a Stashaway user myself and also hosting the shows with our panelists during the Robo advisor episodes, you will be unable to directly credit dividends into your bank account directly.
It will be reinvested directly which I think makes the most sense for long term investors because your investments will be able to compound that way. Cheers!
I'm quite satisfied my performance thus far (around 10% returns), so that's a pretty good sign, and I can choose to withdraw the total amount inclusive of capital and dividend gains with no withdrawal fees as well.1 comment1"
