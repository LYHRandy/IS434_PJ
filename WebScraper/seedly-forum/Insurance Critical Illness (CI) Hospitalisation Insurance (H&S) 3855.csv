question,"Insurance Critical Illness (CI) Hospitalisation Insurance (H&S) Asked by AnonymousAsked on 20 Apr 2019What are some insurance plans I can consider for someone with pre-existing conditions? I'm looking to help my parents get covered, but both have pre-existing conditions. One has heart disease and had a stroke before. The other has high blood pressure. Aside from that, they have family history of tendency towards cancer and diabetes. Looking to find a way to mitigate hospitalisation costs, should their conditions worsen1 answerAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 21 Apr 2019Stroke patients have possibly zero chance of getting coverage for either health or life insurance.For high blood pressure, you can try Raffles Health Shield for health insurance, and some of the newer CI plans like MyCoreCI from Aviva that would insure someone with that condition.0 comments0"
