God of WisdomAnswered on 01 May 2019The % of return required to help you hit your goals is a good investment return.Some people want double digit returns, some are fine just beating inflation.0 comments2"

MasterAnswered on 02 May 2019Many of times, returns are pegged to market i.e. STI Index / S&P 500 - that is a good gauge because if you can obtain a higher return that the market, you would be considered ""beating / winning the market"" Alternatively, if you'd like a bigger challenge, you can peg your returns to the 'big boys' i.e. Warren Buffett or even fund managers i.e. George Soros etc.0 comments1"
3,"Li Yu, Financial Services Consultant at Manulife Financial AdvisorsLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 01 May 2019I agree with Hariz. There's no definite answer. It mostly depends on your own satisfactory level.Adding on to that, risk ususally increases with potential investment return. We can't look at return alone and disregard the underlying risk. What you want in the end is an investment that gives you as close to your satisfactory return as possible at a risk level that you can tolerate.0 comments1"

5,"See all 4 comments Question Poster04 May 2019Wow that so high.. for myself anything above 6% I would consider gd.Jonathan Chia Guangrong04 May 2019Well, why settle for single digit when you can go for double digits? Of cos there are factors to consider like technical skills and risk appetite. Not for everyone. For me I want to catch up to my peers and eventually retire early"

As the saying goes, high risk high returns.As for myself personally, i aimed at just about 5% returns per year (usually from dividends payout).Regarding insurance products, you need to keep in mind that theres a 'lock-in' period (about 10 to 20 years) and if you prematurely cancel or terminate the product you may not even get back your cost. Furthermore, the 4% is usually the 'EXPECTED' returns and not 100% guaranteed. Of course, that being said, if you are getting this for insurance purposes instead of investment then its a different story.0 comments0"
