1,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Aug 2018Hi, you can consider using robo advisors (Stashaway/Autowealth/Smartly) or set up a RSP using POSB Invest Saver to start investing in STI ETF from as low as $100 monthly.0 comments0"
2,"Eric Chia, Senior Financial Consultant at PrudentialLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 16 Aug 2018How much time are you able to set aside for investment? If you have more than 6hours a week available, and like thrill of seeing the prices fluctuate, go manual and try out the stock exchange! You're young (assuming since you're an undergrad) so you have the time to learn and make things work. If you do not have that much spare time, or you prefer to go auto mode and have no risk appetite, setting up a savings plan or using roboadvisors can be a thing to go for. Whatever you do, use this money wisely to build the foundation for your wealth in future! 0 comments0"
