1,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Apr 2019Hi anon, I think we'll have to look at this issue in a different way in order to answer it properly. And that has to do with it's risk (volatility, Beta, Standard Div, etc.).certain types of investments will inherently be more risky than others. When you invest into bonds you generally _assume _that they are less risky vs a stock, but that entirely depends on alot of factors such as country it is located in (is it politically, economically stable?) , the health of the issuer (can they pay back?), currency (is SGD depreciating against the interest currency e.g USD?) - you get the jist. I would happily take a tech stock like Google or Facebook vs a CCC rated bond any day if you are just talking about predictability. That's because these stocks have a lower risk than having a CCC bond from a company about to go bankrupt, and almost defintely won't pay it's debt. This applies to government bonds as well!But for the sake of the argument, let's say we assume that the mutual fund is a stock mutual fund (actively managed) vs a government bond of investment grade: then yes, gov bonds are more predictable because of the whole idea of obligation to pay it's interest vs the management fee + no obligation to payout div for the constituent stocks for the idea of a actively managed stock mutual fund.But if we are looking at mutual funds passively managed, designed to track a investment grade bond index, vs an emerging market government bond that is given a below investment grade level (like Venezuela - their bonds are worth close to nothing, with a rating of C to N/A) then give me that mutual fund please!0 comments2"
