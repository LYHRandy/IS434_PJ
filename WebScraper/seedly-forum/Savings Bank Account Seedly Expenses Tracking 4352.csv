question,"Savings Bank Account Seedly Expenses Tracking Asked by Kee Hwa SinAsked 3d agoIs there a way to update POSB bank transactions extracted into the seedly app rather than to enter one transaction at a time?I really love it when we are able to get updates from all banks. With POSB/DBS disconnected due to security reasons, I was looking if the app is able to take the extract transactions report manually and the app can take this in so that kind of manual process but sure beats every single entry.1 answerAnswerBump1"
