9,"Shawn LeeLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 16 Jun 2019Mine would be ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die"" - by Warren Buffett. It's true, especially given the fact that most Singaporeans will work till they're 70 to have a decent retirement. If you can find your way to make money consistently 24/7 (aka passive income), the retirement age would be much younger.1 comment1"
