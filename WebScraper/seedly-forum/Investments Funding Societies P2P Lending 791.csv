1,"Kenny TanLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 14 Jul 2019What i am very sure is that funding societies is not 0% default rate. I have invested over 150 campaigns with them. currently I have 7 loans defaulted, and no regular update from funding societies on how they are recovering the funds. FYI, my portfolio is in red.0 comments2"

I also have 2 defaults, still a positive for me. Do not be too greedy and still do your due diligence even within the platforms.Pm me if you need advice0 comments1"
