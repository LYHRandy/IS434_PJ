2,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 31 Mar 2019You can also look at the ireland domiciled alternatives like VUSD and CSPX which will reduce the withholding tax from 30% to 15%. Standard chartered is ok and if u have more than USD 100,000, Interactive broker will be even better. You can buy a single share but might not be worth it due to minimum commission so u have to do ur own calculations.0 comments0"
3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 31 Mar 2019You don't need a cdp account to invest in the S&P500, since this is only required for sgx stocks. You can an ETF like SPY, but this will require access to the US market. Brokers like Td Ameritrade or interactive brokers or Stanchart's online trading platform can help you here. Do note that dividends will be subjected to 30% withholding tax, hence you may want to try the Irish domiciled S&P500 instead via the London stock exchange. There is no minimum sum if you are buying SPY as you can just buy one share but it won't really make sense. Not sure if there is a minimum for the Irish one. S&P500 is kinda high now. So may not make sense to invest in it now as part of a buy and hold strategy. Hope this helps0 comments0"
