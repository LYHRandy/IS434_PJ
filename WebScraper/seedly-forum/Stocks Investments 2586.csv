1,"Jackie TanLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 28 Feb 2019If the company's business nature is a cash intensive one, such as casino or bank, then holding a high cash balance make sense. Otherwise, under normal circumstances, having too much cash lying around isn't ideal. cash in the deposit isn't earning the ideal return a company desires. potential 10% from a project vs 0.1% deposit rate. if there is debt, why aren't they use part of the cash to redeem the debt? paying interest on debt can be more painful!poor management? couldn't decide how to deploy resources (cash)? red flag possible? Hence, a good management will justify why they are withholding a high cash balance (e.g. debt obligation to be fulfilled soon, opportunities coming soon and require a cash outlay, etc)0 comments1"

WonderkidAnswered on 01 Mar 2019There is nothing wrong with company holding too much cash.But in situations like, Reserve Take-over, a company will suddenly have a lot of cash. This is a special situation which I will likely to avoid due to future uncertainty.If the management do not have any idea how to use the cash, this is also a signal of company holding too much cash that is bad. For example, I saw many HK companies buying equities due to having too much cash and if I want to buy financial assets I will have do it on my own.0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 28 Feb 2019High levels of cash could signal that there is danger ahead. if there is so much excessive cash, investors would then start to question why is the money not being put to use.   cash could be there because management has run out of investment opportunities or is too short-sighted and doesn't know what to do with the cash. having too much cash also has an opportunity cost, which amounts   to the difference between the interest earned on holding cash and price paid for having the cash as measured by the company's cost of capital. companies with high cash balance may also run the risk of being careless. they may end up having inadequate control of spending and an unwillingness continually to prune growing expense.0 comments0"

WizardUpdated on 28 Feb 2019Interestingly, i read that some research actually showed that companies who have too much cash actually performed just as badly as companies which had too little cash.there was this study conducted by revelations investment research from 2001 to 2016 that showed that companies that held excess cash usually would have poorer performances in the following year. another study by the university of toronto also showed that companies with excessive cash performed worse during downturns.i think this could happen for a few reasons. investors could be losing confidence in how the business is growing and utilising its resources and may feel that management isn't incentivised enough to grow the business. it could also be due to companies performing share buybacks, which may be frowed upon by investors.but it would seem to also depend on what kind of industries that you are operating in. companies with high capital expenditure requirements generally would have lower cash balances with companies that are more technology based. it would also depend on the life cycle of the company or the industry. generall, i think that too much cash is not a good thing.also, holding too much cash would worsen metrics such as return on assets, since your overall return should be higher than that of the returns from holding cash. it also increases the cost of capital, which increases the risk of the business.0 comments0"
