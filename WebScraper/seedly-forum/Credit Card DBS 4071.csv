If you include your bonus and AWS, it will usually be enough to allow you to qualify. Even if including it does not bring you past the threshold, banks are usually able to issue the card if they do not deem you a credit risk. It also helps if you have a POSB/DBS bank account.Having said that, I assume you are talking about the entry level cards where the requriement is $30000 annual salary.0 comments5"
2,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Jul 2019Hi there!Short answer, yes! As long as your credit rating is good.Long answer, still yes! There are a lot of factors as to whether the bank will approve an application. But as long as you have a good credit rating, your application is likely to be approved, as technically speaking, you are less likely not to pay off your credit card bills.And as Elijah mentioned, having a DBS/POSB account helps. In fact, applying for a card through DBS/POSB iBanking is almost fuss-free and you will know the status of your application almost immediately.Most importantly is to take the first step and apply! At best, the bank approve your application. At worse, the bank reject you. In any case, you don't lose anything.0 comments0"
