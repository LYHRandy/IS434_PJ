A lump sum is definitely the better choice. Since capital is guaranteed and that DCA donâ€™t apply here.In fact you have to pay a fee every time you put into SSB. And rate changes every new launch. Doing a monthly investment will also expose you to re-investment risk.If the new rate is really that much better than your rate, just liquidate and re-invest as Hariz said.0 comments4"

And even if a new rate is launched, you can liquidate your current bond and buy the new one if you want. So just go for a lumpsum.0 comments2"
3,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 12 Jun 2019Depends on how much is your lump sum. It will save you the costs and trouble of applying every month.But if you are trying to create a bond ladder for DBS multiplier, you can buy for 6 months. This ensure you get 12 months consistent payouts that counts as investment category.The maximum for SSB is 200k per NRIC. So, you can put in a lump sum first, then do 1k a month till you hit the 200k. After that, you can start to optimize by withdrawing the lower interest rate ones and putting into higher interest rate SSB issues.0 comments1"

Since capital is guaranteed, there isn't a need to dollar cost average. However it will be a different story if we are talking about assets like stocks, funds, etfs etc. These are assets that will move in price and I will dollar cost average if I find that the prices are on the higher side.0 comments0"
