question,"Career Education Asked by AnonymousAsked on 24 Sep 2019Should I go for a better paying job or stick with one with strong company branding?I am a diploma holder in Music and I recently got an admin job in one of the BIG4 firms but they are paying me 1.8k. I got it through recruit exp, they mentioned that 1.8k is a standard admin rate.  I went along with it but my friends told me that 1.8k is very little... Another friend told me that it's a big firm and it would look good on my resume as I'm planning to study accounts degree. But the admin I am doing is HR-based so should I look for something better paying? Or stick with this?2 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 24 Sep 2019I would suggest you stick with it for now. Because you managed to get this job with your Music diploma, which is considered not relevant to your current job. This job will give u experience in admin which you can use for your next jump unless you intend to find a job following your area of study.Stay a few years and see if you can jump elsewhere. Of course, if you decide that higher pay is more important now, then you can try going elsewhere but take note if you are looking for job that is not your area of study, it will be harder to find.0 comments2"

Grand MasterAnswered on 24 Sep 2019Big 4 Firm pays well for accountants and auditors, doesn't mean they pay admin and other job positions better. (But I do hear that the bonus based on number of months are quite generous to the non-core positions too)If it's your first job, don't worry about the pay... or the brand of the company.Focus on what you can learn in the skills at that company.Focus on the long term, the money is very insignificant compared to the potential you can get in a lifetime from skills you acquire early.Think Long Term.2 comments0"
3,"Liew Jue Yi24 Sep 2019Hmm but I'm not very sure what kind of skills can a contract admin staff under immigration department learn other than paperwork in which people did argue that sooner or later technologies are going to take over the paperwork side of things especially in a hr sectorCedric Jamie Soh4w agoYou got a very good point, so think long term. if admin position can't get what that person wants in the long run, then that job is not ideal for him/her"
