1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Mar 2019REITs tend to take on debt to boost their returns and so they incur interest only expense. A higher interest rate will increase the interest expense and thus decrease the cash flow available to pay shareholders. A reduced dividends, decreases the dividend yield thus affecting the share price negatively. Additionally when interest rates rise, the interest yield on REITs rise, thus the value of REITs fall.0 comments0"
