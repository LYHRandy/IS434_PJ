ProdigyAnswered on 10 Sep 2018Hey, I am doing Computer Science at NTU! :)​Can't be sure, but people usually say that CS in NUS is more science-based while CS in NTU is more engineering based!Personally don't feel like there's a huge difference because the basic important concepts like Data Structure and Algorithms should be the same regardless of school.​But interacting with many people through events, what really put one above the rest is the extra effort they put beyond school curriculum, such as doing internships, having side projects and attending hackathons and courses!0 comments0"
