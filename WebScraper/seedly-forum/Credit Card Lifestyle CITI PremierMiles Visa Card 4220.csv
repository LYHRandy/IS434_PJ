WizardAnswered on 16 Feb 2019For KrisFlyer Basic, Elite Silver and Elite Gold members, KrisFlyer miles are valid until the end of the 36th month (3 years). Use your miles on the many flight and non-flight redemption options, including KrisShop purchases, Make-A-Wish donations, Scoot vouchers, and more, before they expire.If your miles are expiring for the first time, you can extend them for 6 months. Select miles expiring in the next six months and you can extend them at a service fee of 1,200 KrisFlyer miles or USD 12 for every 10,000 miles.If you've extended any of these miles before, you won't be able to extend them again.For Credit card points, they usually last around 2 years, before you convert them into miles.A common strategy adopted:1) Rack up credit card points (eg HSBC rewards points)  keep for 2 years (before they expire2) Convert at near the end of 2 year mark to Krisflyer miles3) Rack up Krisflyer miles that can last you up to 3 yearsHope this helps :) 0 comments0"
