At their age they should be enjoying retirement and living life as they please. So personally I don't think they should be getting other insurances.â€‹However, if they like to offset their medical bills further, accident plans in the market provide coverage for General Practitioners and TCM due to accidents (falls, sprains, etc.), food poisoning and etc. These plans cost less than $20/month.0 comments1"
