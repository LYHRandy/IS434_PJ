1,"Jim NgLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 10 Nov 2018It's always good to have at least 6 months worth of salary parked as a reserve because you never know what will happen next.You could be in between jobs, retrenched, etc.If you make do with just enough, you're living with a lot of uncertainty, don't you think?0 comments2"
2,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 14 Mar 2019For me it also depends on your personal obligations - for eg. A married individual with 2 or 3 kids and also parents on each side to support would need to not just think for himself/herself, but also for the family. Conversely, if you are single with absolutely no obligations, you would scale it accordingly.0 comments1"
3,"Anthony OngLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 15 Mar 2019I will disagree with most other people here, and say that ""just enough"" will be enough, because the money should be put to more productive uses and generate returns (particularly if you are putting this towards investment). From that perspective, the reserve fund is just to ensure that you are not forced to sell off your investments and/or make bad decisions just to keep yourself afloat.However, what is ""just enough"" then depends on your personal circumstances. 3 to 6 month household expenses, and not salary, is a useful rule of thumb because it allows for you (and your family) to survive in the event you do not have salary come in as monthly cashflow. To be conservative (and in case you have an extremely low cost of living), this amount should also be able to cover any co-payment or excess requirements under your available insurance policies.To further lower the ""just enough"" threshold, you can also consider including availability of outside sources of money you can rely on if required (e.g. parental help, although you really should try not to).0 comments0"
