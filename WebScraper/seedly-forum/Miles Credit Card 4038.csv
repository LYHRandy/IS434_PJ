1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 17 Aug 2019You shld bookmark local travel bloggers blogs and read as much as you can. 2 blogs I highly recommend:1) Milelion -  https://milelion.com/ 2) Mainly Miles -  https://mainlymiles.com/There is no similar platform to Mileslife but banks run frequent promotions to enhance earn rates, like the recent 4mpd on transport for DBS Altitude cards.There is a lot of tips we can share but you might want to let us know how new you are to the miles game.
