WizardUpdated on 25 Jul 2019I think I know what your friend is saying here.The difference here is that using OCBC BCIP, your shares are stored in custodian with the bank instead of CDP. Meaning the bank looks after the shares for you. It does not mean you do not own them. You are still the legal owner.Using a normal brokerage linked to CDP, your shares are stored in CDP under your name. CDP is just another custodian for shares.The main difference is that you can ""customize"" CDP, change dividend crediting accounts, add joint account owner. CDP also allows you to attend AGM, receive annual reports.2 comments0"
