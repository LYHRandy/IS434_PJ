1,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Nov 2018You can consider using Funding Societies (FS) as they have a pretty good track record of on time repayment and low default rate. You can check out their statistics and our community's experience with FS in the link below. As for regular investments with FS, you can make use of their Auto-Invest function which allows you to choose the type of loan and amount that you would like to invest. Then when a new loan is available and matches your criteria, funds will be allocated to that loan automatically. You can also choose to opt out of it.0 comments0"
