MasterAnswered on 21 Sep 2018Single PR are not allows to Buy BTO or Resale Flat even if they are 35yrs old unless they are going to marry a Sg citizen just in case she read this again 5yrs later.Buying a condo is a big commitment and if she married a SG citizen, she have to sell away her Condo if they even consider BTO, resale flat, or situation like inherited flat by her spouse.If no HDB involved, absd will Not be in effect if the spouse gets another Pty ppty under his own name.Saving up might be a better suggestion unless the she have a plan to benefit from the ppty she purchase.For such planning, a more details analysis will be required.Hope my reply helps.If you feel this reply have Quality, please upvote and check other Quality Reply.https://seedly.sg/profile/a-kenichi-xiThank you.0 comments1"

4,"Pascal SamsoonLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 12 May 2018I would suggest 15 years as a rule of thumb rather than 7 years in Singapore context...also, you need to account that rules might change...​A condominium's 1 bedroom will cost @ least $700,000 excluding ABSD and many other fees to purchase.​If we follow the 15 years rule: assuming the monthly rent is about $2000, the total rent paid over 15 years will be $360,000 (Verdict: Rent)assuming the monthly rent is about $3000, the total rent paid over 15 years will be $540,000 (Verdict: Rent)If you wish to stay in Singapore forever, then it would make sense to buy, but at what price? ​There are just so many factors, and thus it would mostly depend on your own situation. Perhaps, you might stay for another 20 years in Singapore but would want to retire elsewhere? Thus, buying could make sense as you could rent out the property...​​0 comments0"

It depends a lot on how long the lady plans to stay in Singapore for.For non-Singaporean: Renting might be better due to Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD). 
For foreigners, it is at 15%. 5% for Permanent Residents getting their first property.However, there is actually a study done in the US on when it makes sense to rent and when it makes sense to buy. The study determined that 7 years is the deciding factor of whether one should buy or rent. With that being a case study in the states, I believed that for Singapore, the number of years might be more due to the property price being higher, compared to our wage.Hence, should one be looking to stay in a particular country for less than 7 years, renting will be the better option. If it is for an even longer period of time, purchasing might be a better option.0 comments0"
