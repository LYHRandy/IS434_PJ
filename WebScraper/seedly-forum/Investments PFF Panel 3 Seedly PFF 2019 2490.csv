1,"Ivann Fok, Quantitative Researcher at Hedge FundLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 03 Mar 2019Let's take a look at the Singapore market (STI) over the last 8 years. It has been pretty much flat since the start of 2011. This means that if you bought the STI in 2011 and held the index all the way until today, you would have made very little. If we look at the S&P 500 on the other hand. Your money would have more than doubled if you bought the S&P 500 in 2011 and held it until today. (Technically you should convert this time series to Sing Dollars)In terms of risk management, the S&P 500 has 500 companies vs the 30 in the STI which makes it more diversified and lowers the chance of your portfolio taking a hit if one of the markets drops massively due to poor earnings. A lot of the companies in the S&P 500 also have overseas businesses which gives your portfolio that additional diversification across geographies. So if you ask me, my money would be on the S&P 500 index.0 comments3"
2,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 Mar 2019Hello! Personally I think that S&P 500 would be better since it is much more diversified as compared to STI. This is because for STI, it is heavily weighted on favour of financials, making up 59% of the index.  However, the distribution of the S&P 500 is more balanced, comprising 19% Information Technology, and 15% Financials. This diversification would help me to build my portfolio in the long term.Also, as seen from the graphs provided by Ivann, it can be seen that the S&P 500 is likely to have higher growth as compared to STI. Hope this helps!0 comments1"
3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 Mar 2019S&P500, definitely. As the others have mentioned, it has better returns and its more diversified. Look to the Irish domiciled S&P500 ETF to cut down on the amount of withholding tax. Do avoid the lion global infinity S&P500 mutual fund as the fees are rather high as compared to the Etf.0 comments0"
4,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Mar 2019S&P 500 is more diversified and STI ETF favor too much on the banking industry. The returns are better for S&P500 as well.0 comments0"
