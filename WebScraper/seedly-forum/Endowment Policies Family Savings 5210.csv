God of WisdomUpdated on 20 Aug 2019Do bear in mind that if you commit to a short term endowment plan, you absolutely cannot surrender it until the the policy matures, or you will lose money. 3 or 5 years, while not extremely long, is still a period whether you will have no access to this money, and hence you need to consider if you will have enough emergency funds to meet your needs during this period. I'd personally opt for the 3 year one to give myself more flexibility, unless I absolutely can live with not having access to the money for 5 years.2 comments6"
2,"Question Poster15 Aug 2019Thanks Elijah, but one interesting thing about this endowment is that they got this free withdrawal option, if i get married i can take out partially. Never see this kind of clauses before for 3-5 years endowment.

That is the attractive portion.Elijah Lee20 Aug 2019DeleteEditHi Question Poster, yes, you are right, I dug deeper into the wording and this clause is indeed a very unique feature. Still, I would have my emergency funds as the first layer to touch first if I need money, instead of having a partial withdrawal and losing some of the benefits. Still, there is no right or wrong, but only what you feel would suit you."

Do you see yourself needing the cash after 3 years? Going through policypal gives some policypal rebate to use for their other products or can exchange for some discount. You can see what is available in their app.1 comment1"
4,Question Poster15 Aug 2019Thanks so much Gabriel. .It's abit difficult to say whether i need the money.  Explored the PolicyPal app the rewards marketplace like not fantastic :(  But maybe can buy travel insurance when travelling.
