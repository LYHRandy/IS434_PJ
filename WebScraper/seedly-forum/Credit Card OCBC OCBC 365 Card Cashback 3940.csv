question,Credit Card OCBC OCBC 365 Card Cashback Asked by AnonymousAsked on 21 Jul 2019How do you actually calculate how much cashback you get from your credit card spend?I have been using OCBC 365 credit card even though OCBC has already categorized each percentage of the cashback. But I'm not too sure what is the maximum cashback I could get and which categories I have met the most so that I can judge whether the credit card is suitable for me. Anybody using the same card and have any methods to share?1 answerAnswerBump0

1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 01 Aug 2019I am using miles card but I guess the method behind is the same.I use excel. I copy every transaction from my statment and then apply formula.Most of the time, it tally with what the banks give me. If it don't, I will just call them up and most of the time, it is because the MCC is different. Otherwise, they will look into it and then gives you the points (or cashback) after their investigation.Hope this helps!2 comments1"
