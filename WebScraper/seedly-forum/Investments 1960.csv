1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 18 May 2019Hi there Anon, just chanced upon your question, it's an interesting one indeed!Apart from consulting your parents on this matter... :)If I were you, and I'm in my mid 20s. I would go for something which looks like this:Portfolio breakdown for $50k:20% - Cash (in a high yielding bank account between 1.5% to 2% p.a)40% - Local STI stocks (STI ETF, or 2-3 blue chip (large cap) or REIT stocks)40% - Global or US index fund (S&P Vanguard funds or Robo advisors)I would shy away from the bond type of investments because you are still relatively young and have a longer time horizon to let your money grow.I would also hold some cash (20%) in the event of either:Rainy day funds (6 months emergency expenses)Or big ticket expenses eg renovation, family etcOr in a crisis, you have some ammo you can still deploy for undervalued stocksHope this helps!If you are interested to find out more about the REITs segment, you can tune in to SeedlyTV EP05 to learn more!

2,"Cherie TanLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 21 May 2019Hello! :) You’ve got some great advice here. Let’s take a few steps back before diving in. Ask yourself the following questions:What investments and savings, assets and liabilities do you currently own or have? What are your upcoming short term financial goals (marriage, kids?)What are your long term financial goals? Only when you’re fairly clear with what you want to achieve in the next five years to a decade can you make better decisions with the $50,000 you’ve just inherited. As others have suggested, assuming you own nothing else but $50,000SGD, keep at least 6 months of your personal expenses. Perhaps you already have 6 months of emergency funds in your bank, and if so, you can choose to allocate the money from this $50k into other instruments that will grow your cash. If you’re still fairly young:Do you have outstanding education loans to repay? You may want to pay them down to avoid incurring the interest (which can add up really quickly without you realizing!) With regards to wealth growing instruments: Consider a mix of low risk (30%) and high risk (70%) investments. A typical low risk investment would include the STI ETF and NIKKO AM ETF. Higher risk investments and products are plentiful. Do keep in mind to research such investment products before making a hasty decision.Purchasing equity stocks and shares would be fantastic too if you are young, since you have a much longer time horizon to grow your money.If you’re looking to settle down:Save a fair bit of it for your wedding and upcoming expenses, such as your home downpayment. Be sure to have discussed the budget appropriate for the wedding and the home. Assuming you already have your 6 months of emergency funds + some wiggle room, leave the rest into higher risk investments to yield a higher return. You could consider REITS/Property Trusts/Stapled Securities. Again, ensure you have done your homework and research before giving these companies your money. If you’re approaching retirement:Keep a fair bit more into your emergency funds. As we age, we tend to incur higher medical bills. Leave the rest into income-generating assets such as bonds. Do note to also ensure that you’re properly insured and protected from uncertainties such as sudden (and large) medical expenses (you, your children/elderly parents, etc) which you may need to cover.

4,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 May 2019I'll look into putting it in high yielding cash accounts or cash equivalents (ssb, ABF bond fund etc) first. Improve your knowledge about investing before dipping your pinky into the pond. Else you may just find something nasty reaching out and you lose a chunk of your inheritance through error and tuition fees0 comments2"
5,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 29 Mar 2019Put the money into SSBs or any high interest savings account first. In the meantime, research and learn about investments, or go for courses to learn. Remember to check the reviews of courses on Seedly. Some courses may not be relevant/ideal for you.0 comments2"
6,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 29 Mar 2019You can put them into SSBs first. Then use the time while you are still in school to google and read books about investments. Dont rush into it if you dont have much knowledge about investment or personal finance.0 comments2"
