2,"Soh Sing Heng, Financial Blogger at SG Young InvestmentLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 09 Sep 2018I will make sure I invest this $1 Million in dividend stocks that generate passive income for me. The income generated from the savings will last a lifetime while still preserving the original $1M capital. Of course, there will be time to enjoy the fruits of labour too. I love travelling and probably will explore different countries. In fact, I am already doing that now but in a tighter budget only.. lol0 comments2"
