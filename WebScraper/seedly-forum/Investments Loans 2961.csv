1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hey Jeremy, all the best man, and don’t worry it’s only the start :) try starting without capital. True entrepreneurs can survive without much $$$ finding ways to hack “product market fit” and some initial traction to grow your startup.​then once you have some form of traction or paying customers then you should bring it to:​1) angels (network your way around, hang out around launchpad) there’s an Event every other night​2) Venture captial (seed stage)​3) Government grants (only if 1 and 2 cannot work)2 comments6"

MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019First of all you must understand what IT products you are focusing on that provides the main revenue for the company to survive.​I had an IT company with my poly friends and it didn't work out bcos we went Army and our clients default on us bcos we are young and naive.​We setup the websites and gave to the client before he pays any deposit bcos he came from the same Church as one of my partner and he used the product without paying us back.​When we were doing the website project, we gather at one of our partner place and wrote the module together and test it together.​We only have to use transport fee and food when we dun have any income to pay ourselves then.We use our own laptop.​If your family member are well to do and see tt ur business idea is highly successful, u can get them to help support you.​For outsider, unless you have secured a good project or you have an existing good apps or products then you will be able to securePartner investors who work with u and split money according to work load. OrAngel Investors who wants u to pay back even when u dun make moneyI will not recommend bank loan or licensed lenders unless the success of ur IT firm is for sure.​MaNy IT company had used the previous PIC Grants and ICV vouchers to induce Retail or Food Companies to get free online technology with out paying anything but pay IT firm first for the products and claims from IRAS later.​This can only be done without trouble if your IT products are legit and not fake or you will land into trouble.​Even for crowd funding, without a product or a brand you might not be able to get funding.​So all in all, start small, think big and do what you are good at.​If the capital is for hiring specialist to code for u, is better u learn how to code urself bcos long term wise u will Progress and not one left behind.​Hope my reply helps.​If you feel this reply have Quality, please upvote and check other Quality Reply.https://seedly.sg/profile/a-kenichi-xiThank you.2 comments2"

12,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019How sure are you that your venture will be profitable? Considered freelancing to get a sense of the market first before jumping with 2 feet in? That said, if you have a solid business plan, try to find angel investors to pitch to. Network around to find people who can invest in your business. Alternatively, try peer to peer lending platforms. Hope this helps and all the best. 2 comments1"
13,"Jeremy27 Sep 2018Thanks Jonathan. We are researching on this p2p lending platform at this moment. We are in some confusion between angel investors and venture capitalist, do these both types will ask for the shares of the company??Jonathan Chia Guangrong27 Sep 2018It is likely that angel investors and venture capitalists will ask for some form of equity in your company.
