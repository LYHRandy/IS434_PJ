There are no fees on the SRS account. The maximum contribution per year is 15.3k also. How is it possible that they'll charge $50 every year for 15 years?And it says it right here https://www.dbs.com.sg/iwov-resources/pdf/invest/supplementary-retirement-scheme/srs_schedule_of_charges.pdf""All other SRS charges are currently waived by the Bank until further notice""3 comments4"
