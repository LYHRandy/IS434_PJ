God of WisdomAnswered on 07 Oct 2018Withholding 20k will give you 3.5% interest p.a.​However, do calculate your monthly mortgage repayment. 20k @ 2.6% for 30 years is 80/mth less to pay and more relevant if you're paying with cash.​Investing would mean you'll need to constantly beat 3.5% net of fees to be worth it. ​In the long run, I'm quite confident it can. But it's up to your risk appetite.​So cashflow first. Then confidence in performance returns second.0 comments1"
2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Oct 2018If you are confident in being able to consistently achieve a yield above 3.5% every year, do go ahead with investing the funds. Perhaps consider investing into s-reits with strong sponsors and consistent dpu. I was invested in Lee Metal for a period of time before their delisting and they are very consistent with their 5% dividend distribution every year. I've since switched to reits offered by Mapletree and Frasers. 0 comments0"
