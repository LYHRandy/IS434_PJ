question,"Credit Card SCB Unlimited Cashback Card AMEX True Cashback Card Asked by AnonymousAsked on 19 Jun 2019Hello all, Looking for some recommendations on a suitable cashback Credit Card. I'm not really a big spender so I'm looking at one that doesn't require a minimum spend. ?Here are the options I've narrowed down:1) Amex True Cashback2) SCB Unlimited3) ICBC Global Travel4) ICBC ZodiacI'm leaning towards (4) due to its 1.6% cashback and 3-year annual fee waiver. I don't do much overseas transactions and don't drive as well. I'm planning to use this card for my wife's upcoming gynae consultation and pregnancy delivery fees (not sure if this is considered a lumpsum transaction).Appreciate any inputs!3 answersAnswerBump2"

1,"Dexter TiahLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 20 Jun 2019I think the best generic ones are stanchart unlimited card and amex true cashback card at 1.5% rebate on all spend, with no minimum.I personally have the stanchart unlimited card and will be getting the amex true cashback the moment i have a s$5k expense (because you get 3% for the first s$5k spent in the first few months.To maximize your rewards, to some general googling because these 2 cards have quite a big of sign-on bonus (i.e. pick your poison, either singsaver, friends referral, etc).If you want to see which merchants give you additional cashback (above and beyond these 2 great general spending cashback cards), check out www.whatcard.sg before your specific purchase, or as general research to which card to get that suits your specific consumption habits1 comment4"

3,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 20 Jun 2019Quite true for the 4 card between 1.5 to 1.6%, but pretty low these days with no string attached. For the Gynae and delivery fee, I recommend another. HSBC Advance cc. Above 2.8k spending get 2.5% + bonus cash back. Below 2.8k spending get 1.5%https://www.hsbc.com.sg/credit-cards/products/advance/Remember to apply via singsaver for more deals and do check out the T&C on the above links for more details and exclusion. I check that so far medical spending is ok. Cheers2 comments4"
4,"Question Poster20 Jun 2019Thank You! I'm gone ahead and applied for the SC Unlimited Card. Will take note of the HSBC one for the future!HC Tang20 Jun 2019You're welcome. Do apply thru those platform I've mentioned, they are legit and many people has gotten the extra free gift. This is because they get a cut from the bank and they share the cut as vouchers to applicants, so we apply thru them get this cut, bank welcome gifts :) Enjoy :) Also congratulations for being new parents :D yay :D"
5,"PatLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 20 Jun 2019Hmm overall recommend the first two! I've had issues with ICBC and their customer service is not something you want to put yourself through...About the fee waiver, every card has that as long as you make the effort to call in and ask for a waiver. If you use the card 1-3 times a year at least, the waiver will be approved.Btw best to apply online as mentioned by the rest! Singsaver has promotions and the banks themselves have promotions if you apply through Singpass I think. All the best!(PS: If you are working and have a multiplier acc with DBS, frankly the Live Fresh Card is pretty decent for cashbacks! If you spend $80 on transport a month via Simplygo, you get back $4. If you happen to make online purchases, you get cashback too. It's not so much about having 1 card only, but maximizing the benefits you can get from various cards. Doesn't mean I advice getting many cards but 2-3 is alright~ I'm not working in DBS but I found their card convenient!)2 comments2"
