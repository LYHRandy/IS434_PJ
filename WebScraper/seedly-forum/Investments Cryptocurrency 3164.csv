Similar to the dotcom bubble many are just mere 'shell company' like back in those days. There are some projects out there that might look promising, but it is a longshot gamble. It will take awhile before the real promising project surface.I myself is 'invested' in one project I see promising. But not much. If it goes to zero, it doesnt matter. But if it becomes a 10 or 100x bagger, it will be just like strike 4D bonus money. 0 comments0"
