1,"Clarence Chua, Financial Planning Specialist at Prudential Assurance SingaporeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterUpdated on 30 Apr 2019Inheritance and retirement planning are different. Inheritance planning is under legacy. So let’s not confuse them. ☺️Retirement planning at the core of it, for singles or married couples are the same. Things to consider in retirement planning1) Do you have a guaranteed source of income to supplement your retirement? This is a must have!
I recommend you to have 70% of your desired income in retirement to be guaranteed. You see, once you have a guaranteed source of income no matter what, you can get a lot of things out of the way. Imagine having 20k per month, be it if you are sick or healthy.2) Have you planned for the event in case of loss of independent existence?If you were to fall into a coma or something similar, how? Who is going to make decision for you? 
Hence it is important to set up a lasting power of attorney (LPA) and an Advanced Medical Directive (AMD). 3) What insurance do you still need and what you do not need. Most importantly keep the insurance that covers your bills. You won’t really need income replacement if you have guaranteed income.Some numbers you will need to know are
a) your projected monthly expenses and desired income
b) expected increase in expenses (if any) during sickness or long term care needs0 comments2"

WizardAnswered on 30 Apr 2019For single, I think the most important is income and medical expenses.Without family or kids to take care of you in old age, you will need a source of income.Without family to take care of you when you are very ill, disabled, bed ridden, you will need extra medical help, a nurse, maybe a stay home nurse even to care for you.These will incur heavy burden on finances and should be mitigated in some way by planning.As a single without family, you dont need to care about inheritance. Who will inherit your money? Probably strangers if you so wish or maybe dedicated to a charity.0 comments0"

1. No. of years from desired retirement age to life expectancy 
2. Amount of money you would like to spend per month (needs and wants)- I would estimate more due to inflation and different sets of needs at old age.
3. Type of housing at that age (possible downgrade to the smaller flat for excess cash on hand)
4. Possible Passive income (rental income, dividends etc)
5. A little extra for medical emergencies Better to have excess money at that age when you have limited or no income.0 comments0"
