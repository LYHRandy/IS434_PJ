Safest, without too many risks3) Singapore saving bonds? low returns but not much risk.4)   https://timelyenterprise.com.sg/better-returns-than-singapore-saving-bonds-similar-risks/  Slightly higher risks than FD, but higher returns. I placed some money with them a month ago. Small money to be used 1 year later for a property.5) Stick with those saving accounts with higher rates, such as iSavy with Maybank, OCBC 365 saving accounts, CIMB's high-interest saving account? but then, I think 2 would be a higher interest with the same risksI won't suggest any other ""safe"" methods that others may say in this time... such as buy gold, buy bitcoin, buy these recession-proof stocks, or income portfolio funds.... because u need the money in 2 yrs.I have the most money in stocks, a bit of alternative, a bit of bitcoins, a bit of bonds and bank fd.0 comments2"
