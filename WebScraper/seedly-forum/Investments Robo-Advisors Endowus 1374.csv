We started with a minimum of $100,000 and accredited investors only services, but we have broadened our service to retail clients as well with the lower minimum of $10,000. We understand that this is not a small sum, but we hope that investors will be investing through Endowus as a core part of their investment portfolio as we have built it as such. We feel that Endowus must focus on providing holistic financial and investment advice. This includes providing lifetime financial planning including retirement and goal based savings and investments, which is a core focus for us. We will be launching exciting new services in the coming months as we officially launch our services to the retail market. Currently, we are only receiving new clients through reverse enquiry.

In the meantim, please do check out our new landing page which will launch in the next week or so and learn more about what we are trying to do. Thank you! Sam3 comments4"

There is of course a business consideration and a certain cost threshold that we are comfortable with. What we have chosen to do is instead of lowering the minimum, w... (more)"
