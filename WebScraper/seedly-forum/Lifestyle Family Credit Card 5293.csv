There a few things that you will need to keep in mind for the wedding banquet payments (and maybe generally):Take advantage of credit card promos where possible! This may mean cancelling the cards you dont use now (such that in 2020 you and your spouse both qualify as a ""New cardholder"" which most promos are targeted at), or making early payments or splitting into smaller amounts to take advantage of periodic promos (e.g. Citi and ApplyPay last year)Hotels tend to have milestone payment plans - try to structure / ask for flexibility in these so you can take advantage of good promos as and when they pop upPlan your cashflow - if you manage to pay big lumpsums in your credit card in one go, make sure you have enough cash to pay the bills when they are due!As an example, my wedding was late last year and what we did was:pay the initial deposit through a general miles card (there were no good promotions available at that time)make early payment of the 2nd milestone with Citi because it had an ongoing single transaction bonus spend promotion availablesign up for the Krisflyer ascend with my wife and take advantage of the sign up offers they were running for the final portionNot related to them, but I scan the milelion once in awhile to keep track of ongoing promotions etc. Good luck! :)0 comments1"
