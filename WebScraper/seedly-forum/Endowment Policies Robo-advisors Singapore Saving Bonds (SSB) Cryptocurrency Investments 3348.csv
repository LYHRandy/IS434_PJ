MasterAnswered on 21 Sep 2018Certainty vs UncertaintyInstead of hoping to strike it rich with your $100k, you can focus on allowing your $100k to work for you and gives you an income.Just using $10k for an example, If your mobile bill is $50 per month and that is $600 per year.A 6% dividend yield vehicle with $10k, will generate $600 which covers ur mobile bill expense.You still got $90k left to work for you.At the same time, you get to save more and enjoy life a little bit better too.Hope my reply helps.If you feel this reply have Quality, please upvote and check other Quality Reply.https://seedly.sg/profile/a-kenichi-xiThank you.0 comments2"

WonderkidAnswered on 25 May 2018Hi there,​Firstly, you are in very good shape financially and I would like to applaud you on this!​Consider having your insurances in place as this would provide you leverage should any unexpected medical bills or conditions will wipe out your current assets. ​Set aside 6 months of emergency savings in your bank based on your estimated income when you graduate. ​Are there any short term financial obligations you can foresee? If there is, look to invest in safer options as you might need the money anytime soon. You do not wish to have a market downturn affecting your capability to meet your short term goals.​If you are in debt, see if you can pay them off fully as interest rates from loan might set you back for a while. ​Once the above has been sorted, you can see how you want to invest with the rest. However investments differ from individuals as different people have different risk appetities. Meanwhile, read up more on different investment strategies and determine which way suits you best. ​If you are uncomfortable to reveal more on a public platform and wish to discuss further privately, feel free to drop me an email at gabrielgrantt@aia.com.sg​0 comments1"

For crypto either you wait got it to sky rocket again or if fear it'll drop further, best to minimise lost when selling it. Also keep a emergency savings to rely on when needed. Have a warchest ready to pumped in more when the stock is low. 0 comments0"
