God of WisdomUpdated on 09 Jul 2019Assuming you are referring to Singapore Listed Stocks, settlement for your shares is on T+2 and you will receive the proceeds on T+3. Depending on how your trading account is set up, the money may be credited directed to your bank, or you may need to manually withdrawal it from your trading account.Other markets have different settlement dates so you will need to check for them individually.2 comments6"
