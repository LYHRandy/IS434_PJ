1,"Vincent Tan Wen Bin, Assistant Vice President at Thinkers AllianceLevel 5. GeniusAnswered 2w agoThis is my personal opinion. From what I am looking at, cryptocurrency is still not a ""need"" in this market. Valuation of crypto is still based on speculation and there is still no hard facts that it is something that will stand against recession. If you would like to go for traditional assets, I would say that USD or gold is something that would hold their value in recession. In fact, look at how far gold has gone up this year due to weak market sentiment.0 comments0"
2,"JJefremy Level 3. WonderkidUpdated 2w agoIMO, in the case of a recession, all investments will revert to cash. Crypto assets will bounce up hard as institutional investors look for diversification. Crypto's strength is its non-correlation but it is still a financial instrument. Therefore a dip would be expected. Be wary of your allocation into non-performing alt coins.1 comment0"
