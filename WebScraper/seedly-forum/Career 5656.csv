question,Career Asked by DAsked on 27 Aug 2019What's the standard amount of waiting time for a tech MNC to send an offer letter after closing interview?It's been almost a month since I went for the closing interview and I've been waiting for them to send me the offer letter. Got me wondering whether I'll actually get the offer at this point in time. Did anyone else wait very long for their offer letter to get to them?1 answerAnswerBump0

2,"D29 Aug 2019I've emailed the HR team last week, there's still no reply today. I guess all I can do is wait for either nothing or something at this point in time. Thanks for replying thoughGabriel Tham29 Aug 2019Yea, I guess keep your options open. Some will not reply to reject a candidate too. 

Usually I will go for multiple interviews to try and get multiple offers."
