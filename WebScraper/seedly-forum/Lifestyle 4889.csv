WizardAnswered on 04 Apr 2019Personally for someone who tends to save alot for around a decade now, I find that increasingly I don't find gratification in many physical items. For example, I don't buy shoes unless I need to replace them, and I actually wear the same set of clothes to CNY every year for the last 3 years now. I would probably indulge in a good meal with loved ones at times!0 comments1"

So if you eat out more, you got less budget for the rest of the month.For other items like shopping. I will include a budget for this if your monthly salary allows. Don't spend beyond this amount. If you are going for high cost item. Consider saving up this budget to pay for it. The advantage of saving up before you buy, is that it deters you from impulse buys.Alternatively, wait till end of the year or CNY for your bonus. Then set aside a portion of your bonus to be used for indulgences in the next year. The disadvantage is if you spent it all at one go, you don't get to indulge later.0 comments0"

Starbucks: Once or twice a week 
Shoes: When needed or during CNY 
Gaming console: During sales0 comments0"
