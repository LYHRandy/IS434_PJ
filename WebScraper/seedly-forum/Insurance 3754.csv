God of WisdomAnswered on 01 Jul 2019The first and most important insurance will always be your hospitalization plan for your child. After that, as children are more prone to accidents/diseases like HFMD, etc a personal accident that also cover infectious disease like your current AIA Star Protector Plus plan would actually be useful as well. Just ensure that your budget/cash flow is not affected when purchasing the plans.0 comments4"
2,"Eric Chia, Senior Financial Consultant at PrudentialLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 02 Jul 2019AIA Star Protection Plus (from the AIA website brochure) is a term life plan which contains components of personal accident coverage. It's suitable if you do not have budget to get a full whole life or term plan for your child (as the premiums are fairly cheap).In other words, it's only useful if you want to get a life plan for you baby but do not have the budget to do so.I think it doesn't coverage GP clinic bills for the 16 common illnesses. Can any AIA representative clarify this?0 comments0"
