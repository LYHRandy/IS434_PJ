God of WisdomAnswered on 22 Oct 2018Hey Anon, you could get a discretionary managed portfolio from an FA, similar to those created by robo advisories which you can fund using your CPF OA or SRS Funds.Fees are now capped at 1.5% sales charge and 0.7% wrap fee and will reduce to 0 and 0.4% respectively next year.You can decide on your asset allocation and change it when you grow older as well. It is fully liquid and there are no exit charges. 0 comments0"
