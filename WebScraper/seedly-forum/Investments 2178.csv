1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 13 Mar 2019For starters, it's always a good idea to read up on basics so that you know when someone is smoking you. But jokes aside, I do agree that it would be a good idea to fully understand the business fundamentals from a value investors perspective and then complementing it with a technical analysis perspective. There are people who are strong proponents of technical analysis (I once worked for a billionaire investor who was a huge advocate of charting, and believed that everything you need to know is in the price chart itself). Yet, we also did company analysis reports which delved into the business fundamentals ie. Business model, financial profitability, operating leverage and ability to enjoy economies of scale, cash conversion cycle etc.Likewise for guys who are more into Technical Analysis (TA), it doesn't hurt to learn more about the business you are planning to invest in.0 comments2"
2,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Mar 2019Hello!If you are a beginner i think that it would be better to start from the basics and understand about the fundamentals of the company instead of jumping into technical analysis. After familiarising yourself with it, then learning technical analysis would be good !0 comments1"
3,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I would say play to your strengths and see what works best for you. What might work for someone might not work for you.Maybe you can try both fundamental and techincal investing in the long term? If you want to try a new strategy you can use stock simulators and see if your analysis is right after all. This might be a much smoother way to transition.1 comment1"

5,"Shawn Chen TdrLevel 1. FreshieUpdated on 15 Mar 2019Learning TA for investing is very important. Personally speaking, it is an even more important than FA. Generally speaking, it is also less complex and easier to make a decent decision purely on TA alone. Price mostly leaves footprints via chart patterns, whereas FA can be 'subjective' at times. A good company can enter a lousy FA period, or an inherently flawed company can display strong FA numbers/data. Also, there are common traps such as creative accounting techniques and dishonest auditing to lure investors. TA is both time-sensitive and price-sensitive. It is also more flexible in the tailoring strategy for investing across different timeframes (3 months, 6 months, 1 year0 comments0"
6,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Mar 2019Totally agree with what Kah Hwee has mentioned... it is more important, as a beginner to understand the fundamentals of a company instead of learning technical analysis at the start. It is also very mentally tedious to learn both simultaneously and its better to have a good grasp of fundamentals before incorporating technical analysis to optimise your investing by timing market entries and exits.In my own experience though, I started with technical analysis because I'm someone who doesn't mind spending 10.30pm - 2.00am at night looking at the US stock market (10.30pm in SG is 9.30am in New York) and I find that to be more fun. In retrospect though, if there is anything that I would change is that perhaps I would devote more time into learning more about fundamentals so that I can have a more holistic and complete view of how the company is performing, instead of purely depending solely on technical analysis to make decisions.0 comments0"
