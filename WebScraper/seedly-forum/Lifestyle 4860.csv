WizardAnswered on 19 Apr 2019I think it can go 2 ways.Event organiser or online advertisingEvent Organiser: Since seedly is linked to so many in the wealth, finance, investment space, they can aggregate an event such as seedly personal finance festival where all the different bloggers, investment trainers etc can come together to give talks, educate, and interact.Online advertising: With high traffic volume coming in daily, very easy to monetize with display ads, video ads, maybe search ads, contextual and native ads.0 comments1"

Let me do my best to answer you below.I must say that Gabriel here, our super contributor (level 7) has given us a very good understanding of how we plan to monetize.Think TripAdvisor for Personal Finance. Without giving too much away, first in Singapore, SEA next.There are many online advertising models we could adopt, but for us now, it's to become Singapore's largest crowd-sourced knowledge center for all things personal finance realted, and I do think that we're on the way there.Happy for you to be on our platforms as well:Seedly QnA: https://seedly.sg/questionsSeedly Reviews: https://seedly.sg/reviewsYou can access our other tools and resource guides:Seedly Mobile App: https://get.seedly.sg/appSeedly Blog: https://blog.seedly.sg0 comments0"
