1,"David MorganLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 20 Aug 2019Thereâ€™s a lot of untold context here. How old are you? What job are you working at? Do you have commitments that require the salary from your job? Have you saved up emergency funds in case anything would happen to you or your family members during the 3 months period? Any particular reasons for 3 months of unpaid leave? Is the job you are at requires your presence such as F&B/Retail Sector? Are you in good terms with your work colleagues that they would cover your workload? But on the general side, what are you planning to do during the 3 months? Vacation break? Eat sleep repeat at home or? Your boss would be okay with this arrangement if
-You are a magnificent Asset to the Company
-You are second in command after your boss
-You have an understanding boss
-You have to work from wherever you are, be it UPL or VL through a laptop etc
-You have a very good legit reason for the unpaid leave. (My colleague had undergone surgery and got a 2 month MC and a few weeks of UPL to rest.My views may be wrong but I hope there are others to share their own views on your question :).0 comments1"

It would really depend on the reason that you are taking this unpaid leave, and why you are doing it! :) And of course depending on what industry you are in as well. (highly subjective on how the employers are forward-thinking or modern enough).As an employer ourselves, here would be some really good reasons:Learning a new skillLearning a new languageUpgrading your certificationExplore the world and broaden perspectives, currently burnt out (this is subjective and whether your company requires you to currently chiong)Taking care of sick family member (sad but happens alot)Recovering from some illness (also sad but heppens)Some bad reasons or things you should not consider:Because you want a break for the sake of itBecause you are looking to jump elsewhere to another placeAny other non personal or job related reason Hope this helps in one way or other!0 comments0"

WonderkidAnswered on 21 Aug 2019Unpaid leave would normally need management approval and some might even need to write a report to justify them having the headcount but does not work physically for three months. Regardless of how many years you have been in the company, most will not allow you to do so.Your colleagues might follow suit especially if they are travel enthusiastic or whatever and it won't be fair to your colleagues to cover your work whilst you are away.0 comments0"
