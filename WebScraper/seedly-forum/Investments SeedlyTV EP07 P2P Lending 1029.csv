3,"YY Yin YuLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I have just started Funding Society this month. So far, the ROI is about 13% p.a. After minus off the 18% commission given to FS, i get about 10% p.a. The whole application process is easy and systematic. The livechat response is very fast and information provided is clear. There is about 1-2 loans shared per day and factsheet about the loan is provided. I particularly like about the financial information given in there.So far, most of the loan has a maximum invested amount of $50 (some loan is higher, depends).When i don't invest my money for > 12%p.a., i will park the money there. Nonetheless, there is still risk for default payment, take responsibility of that. ​1 comment2"
