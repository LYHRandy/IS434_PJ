1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 12 May 2019I just used Youtrip on my Japan trip, and found rates to be comparable to what I could get from the Raffles Place money changers.Another big plus - when I was out of JPY for a transaction, it converted my SGD to JPY. Which also means, no small change that I need to change back to SGD when I get back! For me, that's a nice plus since I typically don't like to change it back to local currency.Other tips:Still keep some cash in your wallet. Some places would only accept cash, so it's not a good idea to just rely on using credit. Airport currency exchange counters do not give good rates, since they charge a premium for the convenience. Use local currency even if a store says they accept USD. Spend all your spare change before leaving the country. No money changer would change back a few coins for you.0 comments2"
