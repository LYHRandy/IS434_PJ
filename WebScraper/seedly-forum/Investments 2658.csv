1,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Feb 2019Short answer to your question is that ""HIGH"" is relative.Simply looking at D/E ratio doesnt tell much information about a company. It would be good if you can take a look at other financial ratios depending on the industry that you are looking at. For example, if you are looking at an FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods Company), besides D/E ratios, other ratios such as Inventory Turnover, Quick Ratio, P/E, P/B would be good to consider before investing in a company.Back to my answer on ""HIGH"" being relative, Identify the industry of the particular company that you are looking at. By doing a peer comparison, it is more meaningful to see if a particular company is high or low in terms of D/E ratio. Even if the D/E ratio is high, it may not necessarily be bad, it could also mean that this particular company is able to get better rates for loans and hence may make more sense by leveraging through debt. In this case, it is also good to look at the financing cost. When breaking down D/E ratio, one can also look at the type of liabilities the company has, whether the majority of its liabilities is long term or short term, and this may bring about different implications.0 comments2"
2,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Feb 2019Hello! As mentioned by the others, high would be rather relative as whether the ratio is high would depend on the industry that the company is in. It is important to look at the other financial aspects of the company to get a better gauge of the company's financial health. 0 comments1"
3,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 23 Feb 2019Just to give your some numbers, ""readyratios.com"" mentioned that ""Optimal debt-to-equity ratio is considered to be about 1. They also said that for most companies the maximum acceptable debt-to-equity ratio is 1.5-2 and less. For large public companies, it would be much more than 2/ US companies show the average debt-to-equity ratio at about 1.5 (it's typical for other countries too). (https://www.readyratios.com/reference/debt/debt_to_equity_ratio.html)But like Brandan said, looking at the numbers alone probably isn't enough.0 comments1"
4,"Terence Tan, Finance at Singapore Management UniversityLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 25 Feb 2019In my opinion, although debt to equity can be relative to the industry you are in, but it does not make sense to have high debt regardless of industry you are in.However, if you ask me, if you are looking at an Asian company (and not finance industry related), then I will normally like anything below 50% debt to equity. Nevertheless anything about 50% is may not be high.It is just that being a value investor, I am always on a lookout of a lower debt to equity ratio,On the other hand, in US market, I will say a less than 2x debt to equity will be reasonable. But i will have preferred to use Debt to free cash flow instead.These are just my thoughts. 0 comments0"
