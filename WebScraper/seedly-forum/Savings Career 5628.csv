question,"Savings Career Asked by Raimi JasmanAsked on 23 Sep 2019Is working 2 part-time the same as working 1 full-time job despite I'm happier in working 2 part-time jobs rather than dragging my emotions and feeling stress at a full-time job?My savings in my emergency funds are going down. From 18k to 10k and I feel like I have to do something lucky. Iâ€™m 26 yo and below, hence I opened a jumpstart account with Stan chart. However, should I find a full-time job? And if yes, I do need help to get one full-time job :) Thanks Seedly in advance!2 answersAnswerBump0"

WonderkidAnswered on 23 Sep 2019Practical things to consider between part-time and full-time jobs:you might not enjoy full-time employee perks like medical insurance, annual paid time-off (but by law, you should also enjoy PTO based on your tenure with the employer)you might have to file for your own CPF and taxesother than that, I think it's largely the same!If you can juggle two part-time jobs and enjoy both of them more so than your full-time job, I don't see why you shouldn't do that! :)0 comments1"

Grand MasterAnswered on 23 Sep 2019When I conduct interviews for new candidates into my company (My company is small and hence I prefer to be the one that selects all candidates), if I see a candidate with part-time jobs instead of ""full-time jobs"", I will have questions in mind.If the rest of the resume is good, I may take the chance and ask him/her for an interview.If the rest of the resume is so-so, I will take my chance and forgo even the interview (Please understand that each job advert gets tens and tens of emails and resume, so we tend to ignore 95% of them. This is especially when they make mistakes such as no subject, not bothering to write a proper email, and resumes that give us doubts)Part-time jobs, rightly or wrongly, give an impression that the person is unemployable, with no proper skills.. OR the person does not want to settle down and has no interest in staying long. These are not desirable to anyone except firms that hire contract workers... because they save on employee benefits.It's not that you are happier in 2 part-time jobs than 1 full-time job. It's THAT particular full-time job that is a poor fit for what you are looking for. You are not wrong to leave that full-time job, just look for another full-time job that brings you more happiness!0 comments1"
