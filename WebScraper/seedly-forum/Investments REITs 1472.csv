ProdigyUpdated on 30 Apr 2019Disadvantages of REITs include 1) High Leveraged Risk - REITs needs to take advantage of leveraging through loans to purchase more assets for expansion. However, leveraging could result in the risk of loan defaults in poor economic conditions and when interest rates rise.2) Lack of funds to reinvest -
Cannot take advantage of good acquisition opportunities, as they need to pay out 90% of income to unit holders to enjoy tax exemption. They might need to issue new units at discounted prices to get more funds and this will dilute existing unitholders' equity. So existing unitholders should set aside some cash to take up as much of this discounted new units it stand to have their existing shares diluted when more unitholders come on board to share the same pie. Otherwise, the REITs must increase it's funds to take advantage of good acquisition opportunities through more bank loans. will dilute current unitholders’ equity or by increasing its borrowings from banks.2) Slower growth due to lack of funds to reinvest3) Concentration risk as 75% must be in Assets. 
It's rental income and occupancy rate would be affected when there is a downturn in property market.0 comments1"
