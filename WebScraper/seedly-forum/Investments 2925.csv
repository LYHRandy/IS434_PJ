2,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 28 Dec 2018As long as the sums deposited into SRS, they are tax relief.Once you have a DBS vickers account, you need to link your brokerage account to the SRSThe fees and charges are the same regardless of investing in cash or SRS account. The lowest commission to pay out is if you invest $5,555.00 so if you have only $500, just throw into SSB. Wait for it to be higher before investing in stocks, unless you expect the stock to moon. 0 comments0"
