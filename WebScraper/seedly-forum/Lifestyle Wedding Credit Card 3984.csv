1,"Kenneth FongLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019A bit late to the game, but for anyone else looking for the best credit card when paying for a wedding banquet, you have a couple of options.First, ask if you can spread the credit card payment for your wedding expense over a few months. If you can, then:1) For cashback/ rebates - UOB One CardGives you up to 5% rebate on $2000 per month spent (min 5 purchases) but take note that you have to make payments for 3 months (based on qualifying quarters).If you need to make a lump sum payment eg. a huge deposit on your wedding banquet then:1) For cashback/rebates - AMEX True Cashback CardYou get 1.5% cashback on ALL purchases. Plus they usually have a welcome bonus of eg. 3% Cashback on up to a total of $5,000 spend in your first 6 months.2) For miles - Citi Premier Miles Visa CardA new signup usually gives something like 30,000 miles if you fulfil a minimum spend ($7,500) within 3 months from date of card approval. I personally used this to finance our tickets for our honeymoon.Here's a good comparison done by Seedly: Save Money On Your Wedding Banquet: Credit Cards You Should be Using!1 comment10"

3,"Albert MillardoLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 08 Jul 2018If you can spread the payments for a few months, then go for UOB One and pay $2k monthly. That will give you a 5% rebate. Do take note their rebate is quarterly (every 3 months) and if you miss one month then you will not get any rebate. To complement that card, go for SC Manhattan if you have the card. That will give you 3% rebate. There is a min spending to get that 3% but I cant remember. And the card is actually no longer offered the last time I call StandChart. Next best will be Amex True Cashback if you do not havr the card yet as they will have a 3% rebate promo cashback for 6months when you sign up. But maximum of $5k spending. Then after that will be HSBC Advance which will give 2.5% for min spending of $2k. But it has maximum cashback of $70 (so spending max $2.8k).0 comments2"

6,"Deanna LimLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 18 Jul 2018I think it's good to find out what's the miles and cashback cap. I used two credit cards for my wedding banquet - told the sales rep to split the bill (hahaa!)Am personally a miles person, but for such big ticket item - you can use Citi Premier Miles and AMEX True cashback card.​Here's a good comparison done by Moneysmart - https://www.moneysmart.sg/credit-cards/cash-back and https://www.moneysmart.sg/credit-cards/air-miles​0 comments0"
7,Brandan ChenLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Jul 2018Or if you are a fan of cashback. Sign up for SCB Cashback and Amex Cashback and leverage on the welcome bonus0 comments0
8,"Anthony OngLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 08 Jul 2018To add on the Albert's answer, if you want miles, you can also consider using the Krisflyer ascent (promo for new sign ups and above $10k spend), or the Citibank rewards , prestige (if the venue accepts apple pay, for 8mpd).0 comments0"
