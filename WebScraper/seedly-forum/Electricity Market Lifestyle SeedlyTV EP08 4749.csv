1,"Tee-Ming Chew, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 24 Jun 2019I think one way to reduce your electricity bill is to switch to energy efficient applicances (e.g changing to LED lights). I personally witness a 50% cut on our electricity bills just by switching to the energy efficient applicances.However, do note that your initial switching cost will be very high (energy efficient applicances don't come cheap)!1 comment6"

ProdigyUpdated on 24 Jun 2019go easy on the aircon.. it really drains powerswitch to energy efficient appliances / lightingmake it a habit to turn off lights / fans / water heater when not attended.most of the retailers have referral codes.. share them with friends and colleagues to get credit on your bills .. I did this and got more than $200 of free electricity :)1 comment3

Sometimes can use fan.If you are just watching movies or videos, you can turn off the room lights. You get better ambience also.If no one is at home during the day, you can turn off the router, wifi too.Don't leave electronics or devices on standby mode, always turn off the main power plug.Air dry clothes, don't always use the machine dryer. It is one of the biggest culprit of electricity use.0 comments0"
