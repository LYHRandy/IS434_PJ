question,"Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 30 Jul 2019Who should I contact for default on investment payouts?I made an investment with a company some time ago. The payment was confirmed and due 8 months ago, but they keep telling me the funds are being locked overseas and delaying on the payouts. I have suspicions that they do not plan to pay at all.
