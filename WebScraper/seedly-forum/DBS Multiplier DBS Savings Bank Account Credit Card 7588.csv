In addition, some stipends maybe credited at a semi-annual basis instead of monthly basis. :) as for credit card, it should be no issue if u can hit the min salary!0 comments0"

ProdigyAnswered on 04 Sep 2018 Don't think it is because:Your research scholarship stipend and top-ups / augmentations are not subjected to income tax.However, if you are also receiving income under the Part-time Teaching scheme, these payments will be subjected to income tax.http://www.nus.edu.sg/finance/students/research-scholar.html 0 comments0"
3,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 04 Sep 2018Depends on what the Salary crediting code is. It needs to be under 'SAL'. You can check with your Faculty HR (human resource) on this! ​The second part of your question, what I know is that for credit cards, you will need to have a min of $30k per year salary. So if your stipends amount to that, I think it should be no harm trying. You should just try to apply, at the most you get rejected with the reason.0 comments0"
