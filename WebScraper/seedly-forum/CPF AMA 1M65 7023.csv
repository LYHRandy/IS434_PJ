1,"Loo Cheng Chuan, Founder at 1M65 MovementLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Nov 2018The advice is essentially the same. Find a high interest and Low risk asset and use it to build up a financial safety net that on your retirement, you would have a sizable wealth waiting for you. Then sequentially build up your equity portfolio without the butterflies in your tummy affecting you when markets go on a roller coaster. Truth is, I canâ€™t find a financial safety net better than that of the CPF SA Account. The high return rate, the illiquidity (so that I can not touch it) and the stability cannot be rivalled by another other asset available in the market. 0 comments1"

There are many investment vehicles available, the key is whether one is disciple enough/able to to set aside the money.0 comments0"
