1,"Harvey TanLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 17 Sep 2019I have laid out a couple of reasons below:When 3140.HK is trading in the Asian hours, it will not be trading close to its NAV since the underlying securities are all US-listed stocks, ie when 3140.HK is trading, the US market for US stocks like Apple, Google is closed.Not being able to trade close to NAV means that there will premium/discount to the NAV. If there is a premium, it means that you have to pay more. This will increase your trading cost.Since it is not as popular, the trading volume will not be as high as the ones traded in the US. As a result, it will increase the bid-ask spread, which once again, increases your trading cost. 3140.HK cost more to invest than VOO (0.18% vs 0.03%). If you are cost-conscious which you should be for broad-market ETF, then going with VOO makes more sense. But then again, please note that US-domiciled ETF is subjected to a 30% dividend tax withholding. Look to Irish-domiciled ETF which has 15% dividend tax withholding.
Hope this helps.
