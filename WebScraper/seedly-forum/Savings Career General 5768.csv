1,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019My PSLE score was 206! :)​I still remember very distinctly when I was going up to take the PSLE result slip from my teacher in Rosyth school... my teacher had a strange smile. I got it, sighed and walked back to my seat.​My parents were peeping through the window but at the end of the day, they gave me a pat on my back and in my head, I thought I was going to be ruined for life. However, I knew I wanted to be a Comic Book artist cos I loved to draw. ​Lo and behold, I went to secondary school and started realising that studying was not actually so difficult, it was a system to reverse engineer (which makes me question our system sadly...) The results showed that:​- PSLE: 206- O Level: 7 A1s and 1 A2- A Level: 5As​At the end of the day, I did not become a Comic Book artist and instead went to university instead. I was an angry student and wondered why what better I could be spending my time on. ​After that, I went ahead to venture into the world of startups and never looked back. Best decision ever :) Now, I am happy to have co-founded Seedly and working with really amazing people on a meaningful mission of helping others make smarter financial decisions as a whole! Managed to raise over $500k of venture capital, launching products, failing along the way and growing a team. Let's see where this goes.​Very happy to be here with everyone sharing our experiences as a whole.​Oh yes, and really grateful about this campaign by the #lifebeyondgrades team. It really is so true, especially in today's fast changing world! 6 comments15"

MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019PSLE: 160N Levels: 7 points Polytechnic Foundation Programme: 3.6End of Year 3 (Poly): 3.95Didn't went through O Levels and took the Polytechnic Foundation Programme path. Graduated from Ngee Ann Polytechnic in May 2018 as the Gold Medalist and Diploma with Merit in Business Information Technology. Was also the Valediction for my graduation sessionCurrently serving National Service as a Signal Operator and will pursue a Degree in Computer Science at Nanyang Technological University after I ORD in 2020I strongly believe that grades do not define someone and their future. Took part in many community service activities with the main one being a Youth Expedition Project to Lombok, Indonesia for 2 weeks. Did a 6 months internship overseas in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam as a Customer Success Engineer as opposed to many others who stayed in Singapore.#lifebeyondgrades8 comments9"

7,"Tee-Ming Chew, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Sep 2018PSLE: 203​Went to polytechnic and eventually a local university.​Do grades matter? No.​I have seen many successful people who did not have good grades or went to good school to be successful. What matters is to find something you're passionated about and work extra hard on it.​I'm fortunate to find what I like to do early and happy to be working with some of the great people at Seedly now.​​#LifeBeyondGrades0 comments6"

10,"Steph Yeo, Auntie Uncle Whisperer at Agency for Integrated CareLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019262, quite up there but only because i was under house quarantine the few weeks leading up to PSLE. Thanks to influenza during the SARS period.But i was otherwise an average student after that. Loved all my CCAs more than actual studies. Found my way into grassroots work during uni and wanted to do something useful for the community. I guess that shown thru my class participation in uni, cuz when i graduated the first qn my prof asked was, ""so what community job are you going to do?""And now i help aunties and uncles live well and age gracefully(:2 comments6"

12,"Huang YixuanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Sep 2018253! Went to River Valley High School and I was below average cause I’m really bad at studying. Butttt managed to scrape through A levels with passable grades and went for Industrial Design in NUS. Best decision I’ve ever made cause here’s where I found my passion in design and for the first time in my life I enjoyed working hard! Although people say that PSLE grades don‘t matter, In my case it sort of does. Cause in RV the majority is hardworking and nerdy, so no matter how slack I am, I still did okay due to my environment. 0 comments5"
13,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019My PSLE score was 224.  It didn't actually improve for O levels, for Poly - I mostly stayed a B+ student. I never did outperform my older siblings or most of my peers in terms of academic study.  ​Eventually, I realized that I enjoyed teaching. I applied for NIE 4 times, and was rejected all 4 times over the course of 7 years. ​After over 500 hundred applications and 40 interviews later, my first job offer was for 2.6K/mth for 5 and a half days. I thought about all the money and time that my parents had spent on me, and the future that I wanted for myself - and decided that it was time for me to change. ​Currently I do multiple things - I work as a Associate Financial Consultant for a Financial Advisory (specializing in Early Critical Illness and Investments), I run a business management consultancy practice and I invest aggressively in the market, making around 3 times or more what I would have made if I hadn't decided to take big risks and get my act together.​I think that social mobility, or greater success from what you thought you were - starts from the mind, and often it starts with a motivation that isn't you. Once I stopped thinking about me and starting looking at the big picture - a future marriage, my aging parents and the crap my friends and siblings had to put up with, you'll find ways to improve. From there its a strong support system, a bit of luck and tons of hard work. ​My PSLE score didn't define me, but it came very close to - and success was all about one aspect. ​Honestly - if you focus on the people who love you - even if you're not earning a lot of money or as academically inclined as you were in primary school - I think you'll still be a big success. ​​​3 comments5"

20,"Adrian Tan, Computer Engineering at National University of SingaporeLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 20 Sep 2018PSLE: 236O's results were actually damn good but I chose poly route because Infosec is fun, and #techforlife​Switched to computer engineering now in uni because hardware sounds cool too, and also it's my last chance to have fun and fail with no repercussions before actual adulting starts.​Passion and hard work in what one does is actually way more important than grades. (Might sound ironic coming from me but it's what I have always believed in)​Hopefully I can think of a fun and awesome way to benefit the community at large using tech and engineering after graduation!0 comments3"
21,Leona GohLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019My PSLE score was 176.Today i'm a 22 year old degree holder working my first proper job at Seedly as an intern and I honestly never thought I'd be doing what i'm doing given my PSLE score.I was a an NA kid and sadly attended a school that to me felt extremely discouraging.My N level score was 19 points.However I am extremely blessed to have parents who sent me overseas for my high school and university education.I now hold a B.A from the University Of Melbourne and doubled majored in Media & Communications and Screen & Cultural Studies. My grades when I was younger definitely affected my but i'm glad to say that they did not define me :-)Excited to see where this journey of adulting takes me!1 comment2

23,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 10 Apr 2019272 - and I definitely do not believe that grades are a benchmark of success later on in life, especially PSLE scores. Based on my own career path and also my observation of those around me, success in career (not talking but other forms of success) is all about grit, resourcefulness and determination #lifebeyondgradesAs a kid, I think my wildly volatile grades were very scary for any parent - as I would literally go from being placed in a 'special needs' class to scoring the top grade, then going back to failing several papers and then subsequently graduating top again. In fact, if I had a kid, I would probably tell him/her to focus on gaining skills more than getting good results.0 comments2"

25,"Heng Kai Le, Mondomover at School Of LifeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 07 Jun 2019I once wrote a looooong FB post about this. I paste here in all its glory.I work as a primary school teacher and am teaching ex-students how to cope with the sting of failure arising from interviews, haha. (Can't sleep. Argh. So maybe I should write something.)My PSLE score is 250. 3As and an A in Science.
Which probably meant very little to my Chinese teacher, Mrs Luo. I still remember vividly how she asked me in surprise, ""How come you didn't get an A in Chinese?"" (Geez, how do I answer this question when I don't expect to get an A* for Chinese in the first place?)Part of the reason why I didn't get an A* in Chinese was that my parents, upon realising that I had gotten a B in Science for my prelim, went into high alert mode, FORBADE me from studying any more Chinese and asked me to focus on Science.It was many years later when my mum told me that my dad had pored over my Science notes for two weeks before endeavoring to explain concepts to me that I realised how he had taken on something that was out of his comfort zone. Especially so when he himself was an arts graduate, having majored in Geography and History at Nantah.The irony is, I actually exceeded my parents' expectations. You see, they placed Ang Mo Kio Secondary School as first choice, never mind the slight fact that the premier school in my town - Anderson Secondary School - was literally just across the field from my primary school. In fact, my form teacher had strongly urged me to change my first choice to Anderson. But my mum didn't think I would get in, didn't want to put so much pressure on me, and refused to budge. Bless her wilful nature, hahaMy PSLE score may have nothing to do with my life now, but it, nonetheless, left an indelible impact:a passion for Chinese because I was flattered that my primary school Chinese teacher thought so highly of my ability. A passion that lasted throughout my schooling years and promoted me to apply to be a Chinese teacher the first time I submitted my application to MOEconfidence to follow my heart and tread my own path, never mind if others disapprove of my decisions. This involved disappointing my mum when I informed her that I had quit Singapore Polytechnic in order to teach in Japan, haha.an understanding that big moves must be made if I want to game the system. I will like to think how this helped me during my first (and final) venture as a GP tutor for graduating J2sMonumental life lessons from a seemingly insignificant exam in the grand scheme of things. All this wouldn't have been possible without my parents.0 comments1"
26,"Jasmine Chye Fong YeeLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 21 Sep 2018PSLE: 218
I was more upset then about not getting into the secondary school downstairs than my score. Went to a brand new secondary school and was in the top class but made so many friends and so many nice memories that I don't regret. :)Went to Poly because I wanted to learn how to create websites - graduated in the top 10% cohort for my diploma and went to NUS. Graduated and now working in an MNC.I personally know what I want to do and what I want in my career. Work life balance is very important to me so I am happy where I am as my work allows me to be comfortable in funding my hobbies after work :) being happy in life is important. 0 comments1"
