question,"Family Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 06 Sep 2018Being the sandwich generation, how do we determine which level of IP for hospital plan is sufficient for the elderly parents but not damaging to our wallet?Would you purchase the highest hospital coverage (up till private hospital) for your elderly parents or you would consider premium which is affordable yet able to cover the parents till at least Class A under public hospital?Assuming they have no pre existing illnesses.5 answersAnswerBump1"

1,"Cherie Julianne Tan, Content Strategist at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Gonna give you a thumbs up for this question. I hope you came here after reading the article I wrote on how we can provide for our parents.  (Just hoping, it's okay if you didn't. You can still check it out haha)​I would ask my parents which ward would they be comfortable with and go with it. If you are able to afford private level of IP for your parents for the coming years, why not? If you are wondering what are the benefits of holding onto a private ISP instead of downgrading, I actually went through it here. ​For my case, if I have to pick either private or Class A public ISP, I would go for the latter - class A public ISP.Most importantly, we would like to reduce the expenses so I feel adding on an ISP Rider would be essential.1 comment2"
2,"WAWena Ang08 Sep 2018Hi Cherie, i have read the article before posting. Hence needed more opinions or advises on my questions. My parents have no opinions and are clueless hence they actually followed suit whichever ISP the insurance agent suggested them to buy. Currently my parents are covered 100% till private but the premium costs abt 3k p.a (each parent) which is quite heavy for my wallet given my situation."

This plan is the exact same plan provided by all the insurers in Singapore.It still has limits and does not have a ""As Charged"" Benefit and coverage up to B1 Ward.For Private or Govt A Ward, just do the same comparisons between the insurers to see which suits you best. All of them have differing premiums and slightly different benefits and USPs between them. 0 comments2"
4,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 06 Sep 2018Having the rest stating their answers. I give you food for thoughts instead.1) Scenario 1: covered under Standard Plan. Most hospital bills hover between $15,000 - $35,000 depending on severity of sickness and days in bed, less ICU. This is covered together with the standard plan.2) Scenario 2: B1 ISP. Pre and post hospital treatments are covered with a limited degree. Can enjoy outpatient and community hospital etc, almost 99.99% certainty, that subsidised hospital bill is covered in many cases.3) Scenario 3: A ward government. Has better choices in government hospital. However, means testing has failed. If the treatment continues for illing disease, or if you are not eligible for subsidies (high income earner), you will need this Plan.4) Scenario 4: Private Hospital. You need the best treatment and without any delay. No worry for cost. But premiums very high.Go through the scenarios and think about it for what type of treatment you want.0 comments1"
