1,"Harvey TanLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 28 Aug 2019If you want a hands-off approach towards investing, VBAL/XBAL are both pretty decent choices. They are cheap and they get the job done. Asset allocation is at 60% equity and 40% fixed income. Note that the country allocation as of 31 July in VBAL seems to be skewed towards Canada (29.6%), and China (2.4%) seems to be underweighted for some reason. Considering the influence of China and its growing economic prowess, underweighting China does not seem like a brilliant idea.If you are looking for a “truly” global diversified portfolio, VBAL seems to be lacking enough exposure to China. You might want to add 2801.HK in your portfolio. Alternatively, you can construct your own globally diversified portfolio consisting of ETFs. For example, see below;55% IWDA iShares Core MSCI World UCITS “World” equity market ~ approx. 60% US market25% 2801.HK iShares Core MSCI China Index ETF China equity market20% AGGG iShares Core Global Aggregate Bond UCITS ETF World Bond marketAsset allocation is at 80% equity and 20% fixed income. Feel free to make adjustments to the underlying allocation that is in accordance with your risk tolerance. In general, the lower your risk tolerance, the higher the bond allocation.If constructing your own portfolio is too cumbersome for you, you can always go for VBAL.As always, do your own due diligence.On a side note, I am starting a financial blog.

2,"SSriram28 Aug 2019Hi Harvey,  thanks for your answer.  But you have lost money in the Chinese index if you invested back in 2007-2008. You see their index it's primarily stimulus-driven IMO and you see peaks after the stimulus followed by a continuous plateau. 

Also, the VGRO or XGRO rebalances for us and its currency hedged to Canadian dollars.  Chinese currency is easily manipulated and I personally don't want to have such a high exposure to China in a 3ETF portfolio. 

Looking forward to hearing your opinion.Harvey Tan28 Aug 2019Hi Sriram 

You would have lost in the US market (same goes for most of the other markets) during the same said period. The S&P 500 Index generated return approx. -39% and 5% in 2008 and 2007 respectively and yet the US market has rallied more than 200% since then. Furthermore, singling out a country because of the return from one period without taking into account of its fundamental, does not seems like a prudent approach towards investing.
