1,"Ng Wei En, Bsc(Information Systems) at Singapore Management University Level 4. ProdigyAnswered 2w agoUsing your most bang for miles/cashback credit card to top-up your Grabpay, then using  Grabpay Mastercard to top-up your Revolut or YouTrip card would be the most rewarding approach. If the merchant accepts Grabpay/Favepay, proceed to pay using these payment methods. Otherwise, if the merchant accepts cashless payment(Paypass/Paywave), use YouTrip or Revolut.0 comments0"
