1,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Oct 2018You don't need courses when you have Seedly articles to read!Alternatively, do consider Dr Wealth courses. Can't say they are all good because I've only been to the REITs foundation course, but the REITs course is pretty good; very well paced with sufficient knowledge to get you started!0 comments0"
