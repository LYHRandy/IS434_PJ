1,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 06 Apr 2019The number 1 question.Are you able to self insure when accident strike like now?If yes, would you want to take a hit on your wealth then?If no, then would you want to risk the chance to be unable to even afford treatment etc?For me personally, I go by whether it's easy to recover the risk. (etc paying 0.1% of 1 million to insure 1 million on a low probability is good, because I can use my dividends to pay for it and protect that 1 million.)If it cost 10%, then I am more incline to just invest instead because by year 10, I would have self insured once.0 comments0"
2,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered on 03 Apr 2019Because you can die and fall sick tomorrow. Or anytime.Only once you feel, even if you die, your family will be able to survive and life will go on without you there, and they still live comfortably, would you not require any more insurance.And when you are at that stage, you'll still realise that you can trade 2-3% to cover 100% of all your assets, you'll still take the insurance.The super rich buy more insurance than anyone else btw.0 comments0"
3,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Apr 2019Because theres no guaranteed returns in investment. If you were to fall sick before you have enough money to afford the accidents cost or before your investments are successful, insurance will be able to pay for it. If you have barely enough returns for your accidents, you have to also take into consideration the time u take to feel good enough for you to even think about investing.0 comments0"

If say you got a serious illness which lands you in a long hospital stay plus specialised surgery, maybe few hundred K, 100-200 K, are you able to cough out the cash to pay when you discharge?Also, dont forget if you get a serious illness, you lose the ability to work for a period of time and may extend even longer. Unless you got some hugely massive passive income coming in, then you can cover else insurance is the way to go.There are so many scenarios that do not favor not having insurance. Perhaps if you are a billionaire, and can afford the best healthcare and treatment without insurance claims....0 comments0"
