question,"Expenses Tracking Savings Investments General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 19 Sep 2018Is NS allowance enough?I’ve always get disappointed about our NS allowance. It is so little and unfair. But after reading Rich dad Poor dad, I realised that at end of the day, the heart of serving is not for money but for somethings else. In this case, for the country. Low income made the poor complain. However, it also made certain individuals become even more Creative in making money work for them. I don’t know about you but, NS is giving me a more valuable lesson: Don’t work for money, make money work for you.6 answersAnswerBump1"

For the start I felt like NS was really burdensome. So much stupid things to do just for that $560. For others they graduated and then got enlisted. Suddenly every month have money. Will they feel it's a lot since its their first time getting an salary? 0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 19 Sep 2018Well it's not exactly a lot but if your unit requires you to stay in, it will help a lot in saving up as you'll have lesser expenses such as transport & food. I set up a POSB SAYE account which forces me to save a part of my salary every month and in turn, earn 2% interest on those savings after I ORD0 comments0"

5,Jay Liu20 Sep 2018You might not have guard duty to do if you're not a combatant/non combatant vocation. You may be combat fit but not a combatant. Haha. Side note: I'm a airforce driver and combat fit. No guard duties. Nicholes Wong20 Sep 2018Yea but i got a feeling i will get combat vocation. Because when i graduated from ITE and was waiting to go Poly. They send me letter asked me to go Hendon camp for the vocational assessment and i said no. Then after awhile they send me letter tell me go Guards...... But i managed to get into NYP and deferred.
