question,Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 22 Aug 2018What type of insurance should I get?Hi there. I’ve been working full-time for the past 2 years and drawing an annual income of about 35k. I have yet to have any insurance for myself and have been wanting to get myself insured. I’m getting married next year and I can only afford getting insurance after. What type of insurance do you guys recommend to securely insure myself? I would appreciate the suggestions.2 answersAnswerBump0

1,"Eric Chia, Senior Financial Consultant at PrudentialLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 23 Aug 2018If you have yet to get any insurance, please at least get yourself a hospitalisation plan! It's the first plan to get to cover hospital expenses, and the cash rider is very affordable - less than $2/day if you're below 40yo.​If you're asking in the context of getting yourself insured because you're getting married, then things become complicated. You should have an idea:is it going to be single income or dual income family?are there family planning (kids, house, renovation) involved?would you be required to commit to yours or your spouse's family financially after getting married?​If you like to securely insure yourself, then you should get (in order of importance, and concidentally in order of increasing premiums)hospitalisation planaccident plan (especially if you're planning single income family)term or whole life plan covering death to early stage critical illnesseswellness plans such as PruLady and PruMan that offers free biennial medical check ups​Not sure why you can only afford insurance after getting married, because the amount of these premiums cost pales in comparison to your wedding costs. If you can afford to spend on wedding, there's no reason why you should delay getting insured. #justsaying0 comments2"

MasterAnswered on 22 Aug 2018Hi,​Here's a useful link to get you started. https://blog.seedly.sg/working-adults-what-are-the-key-insurance-policies-you-should-get-in-singapore/​I'd priortize your hospitalization plan Integrated shield Plan and your Critical Illness plan because these two plans specifically address YOU and your needs. Life insurance is more of a byproduct, unless you have dependents. Of course, more information would be good I've made some exception for people who are the breadwinners of their parents already...their untimely death would be a much bigger kick in the face for them than most people. ​I'd love to help you with a comprehensive review of where to best allocate your budget to first, based on your very personal needs and preferences - but alas, I'm on vacation till September! Still, if you don't mind waiting, you can always drop me a message here.  https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments2"
