3,"Hoh Shi ChaoLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Dinner was provided! The event was quite informative however the session is really short. There are still a lot of things more that can be shared. I think more info would be better but then that would take a longer time. I wish they would share the slides though, because I was engrossed in the talk and did not have time to take down notes or photos or think of questions. They explain things quite clearly. I would attend future sessions (102 perhaps?). Either way it is a good start/intro to your own money management.Edit: would be great to explain more about selling away our policies! Rather than giving it up totally and get the basic refund I would rather get a higher amount. Also, would be great to say more about the savings account thing about the 1% interest4 comments6"
4,"See all 4 comments Loh Tat Tian06 Dec 2018Many bond investor would want to takeover your policies since their Potential return is higher. And also, the risk is on the third party. For yourself, you just get the money and the policy is not your concern anymore.

You may look for Reps Holding and Purvis Capital to understand more :)Lim Chun Long Jimmy09 Dec 2018DeleteEdithttps://www.fidentiax.com/

11,Xiang Jing OoiLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I felt that Kenneth was a very engaging and lively speaker and he was able to break down the financial terms into something very simple and easy to understand. however I feel That maybe the link between the title of this event ‚Äùwhat your agents won‚Äôt tell u‚Äù can be made clearer during the session. 1 comment5
12,"Loh Tat Tian05 Dec 2018Apologise about the difficulty to highlight. I wish to point out something (which I didn't really). 1) Aviva Mindef is one of the cheapest terms plans, and it can be extended to your spouse and kids. 2) Agents frequently like to exclude ""exclusions"" 3) Agents will never go through the internal rate of return with you. 4) They are not as candid as me :p"
