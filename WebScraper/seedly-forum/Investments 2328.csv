1,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Depends on what your goal is - if you are trying to just get modest but consistent returns, you can just go ahead to invest in a ETF that tracks a market index of your choice (preferably S&P 500) by yourself, and not having to pay the relatively higher fees of an active manager. Of course, this is if you are quite comfortable with just having market returns, and having generally lower risk. But if you are seeking for much higher returns, in the double digits, you definitely should stand a better chance if you pass your money to a active fund manager ofreputable status. I must say, however, that a manager who did well for 3 years may not necessarily do well for the next 10, 5, even 3 years. There is alot of academic research that shows that manager performances don't consistently beat the market in the long run. But active managers are able to do customizable investment to your risk appetite that can gain much better returns than the market index, you just need to also be able to take the risk of losing as well. After all, active trading carries specific risks that  having a diversified index portfolio like a ETF don't carry.4 comments1"

My experience personally is that most funds return in either single positive or negative digits a year. Perhaps an outlier year of double digit returns but not consistently. The only ones I know that may return in double digits are perhaps hedge funds. Cheers"
