question,Loans CPF Savings Asked by AnonymousAsked on 25 Nov 2018What should I do? Pay off CPF loan first or continue to save and invest?I am in Uni Year 1 and have $6k in my bank now but I owe CPF $4k for my Poly school fees. Should I pay now in one lump sum/monthly or just wait until I graduate? My parents are reluctant to help me pay CPF first as they are using cash for my Uni school fees. Is it better to save 6 months worth of emergency fund before I continue to invest in RSP every month as I am currently doing so?4 answersAnswerBump0

Bank interest is low and the amount pay back to CPF will be given the prevailing CPF interest rates.To your next question, always make sure you have the min 6 months emergency funds before you start investing.  0 comments0"

I think it's better to pay off your loan first to prevent paying more for interest over the next 6 months. Market isn't that good recently, and you wouldn't to make significant gains through RSP over the next 6 months (possibly lose your capital).0 comments0"
