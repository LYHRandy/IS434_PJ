1,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 May 2019There's no ""better"". It depends on your risk appetite. Stocks are likely to be more volatile than bonds (in most cases). It depends on whether you can stomach the volatility and sleep well at night.A balanced portfolio would consist of both stocks and bonds. You'll need to think about how to allocate your funds.0 comments0"

They're both good and have a place in everyone's portfolio.You don't want to have 100% exposure to stocks when you're 60, and you may not want 100% exposure to bonds when you're 25.All asset classes have their pros and cons, and together they make a balanced portfolio.0 comments0"
