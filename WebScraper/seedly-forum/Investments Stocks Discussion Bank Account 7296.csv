question,"Investments Stocks Discussion Bank Account Asked by AnonymousAsked on 14 Sep 2019How should I diversify and grow my investments effectively?I am currently in my mid/late 20s, with savings of 20k. I'm currently investing 5k using AutoWealth and StashAway (planning to increase both to 10k and invest 500 SGD per month). Going forward, I also plan to put 10k into DBS digiPortfolio's Asia portfolio when it is released (also thinking if I should invest in DBS digiPortfolio's Global Portfolio).Does this investment strategy make sense and how I can better optimise it? Thanks!2 answersAnswerBump0"

You don't actually need to diversify even more with different Robo-advisors. Just find 1 or 2 Robo-advisors that you suit the most and that is good enough.0 comments0"

Your money is well diversified in AutoWealth and StashAway.Why not just continue into these 2 Robo-advisors, and see if you can get more cost savings from them in terms of lower fees (for larger amounts).In the long run, you save time monitoring 2 Robo-advisors instead of 3 or 4.... time is useful for other purposes.I think you are doing great investing dollar cost averaging monthly. keep up the good work!!  :D0 comments0"
