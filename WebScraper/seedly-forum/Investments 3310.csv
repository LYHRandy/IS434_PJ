MasterAnswered on 29 Sep 2018Hi, FA here. ​I've had quite a high degree of success in the Indian market, where I made the majority of my money last year for an overall of 32.7%. The contributing funds that I invested in India did abour 40%+ in 2017.​The volatility of the market is certainly one of the highest according to geographical sectors, but annualized returns are typically at least double digits across time net of fees, which is why I'm so heavily invested into them. ​You should expect a 10 - 15 year time horizon in order to safely sell high. ​India funds are also one of the few exceptions where active funds/unit trusts outperform the market, often by large margins. ​Domestic performance in India tends to surpass US fund management even further, since the majority of US fund managers who invest overseas tend to take a top down approach instead of a bottom up one. Most of these guys tend to have returns closer to 20% or more, while the prior mentioned is 10%+. ​If you're interested in investing in India, you can always reach me here.​https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.54​​
