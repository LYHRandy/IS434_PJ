1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 24 Sep 2019I did (I shall not mention the name of the clinic here), and suffered from the aftermath of Recurrent Corneal Erosion (RCE). RCE, in short, is a chronic relapsing condition caused by a breakdown of the corneal epithelium. So basically what happened was that during the operation itself, I realized something was wrong when the surgeon kept swiping my eyeball for a longer time than I thought was required. It was only when I saw the nurses' nervous face when I asked, 'is something wrong?' The surgeon then replied to say 'after cutting the flap, it does not seem to be attaching back properly'.
Keep in mind that with any LASIK procedure, you will have to sign the indemnification form.
The way he dealt with it is that he had to put an ultra-big contact lens (its called a  hydrophilic-bandage contact lens ) into my eye (one that can only be put in at the clinic) to prevent my cornea from shearing off.
So when he took it off, I thought that that was the last time I had that problem.
But for the next two years, I suffered from frequent corneal tears, that left me unable to open my eye on one side without painful tearing. How this happens is:The eye, if not lubricated by a thick vaseline material which costs $12 for a tiny tube that you use in a few days, would dry out when you sleep. If it's dry, the top layer could then attach to your eyelid.When you open your eyes in the morning, the eyelid with the cornea attached to it lifts right off, resulting in a very painful corneal tear which basically affects your ability to open your eye without intense/painful tearing. While I would recommend that you do your research before choosing a good clinic, I would also say that I did my own research and chose one of the best-reviewed clinics on the market, and even paying a premium.
When I went to the Singapore National Eye Centre for a second opinion, it was quite clear to me that they were reluctant to give a medical opinion without first asking me who did the procedure.0 comments1"

Once a person reaches 40 years old and above, you return to wearing spectacles again. ""Old flower eye"" or long sightedness, which lasik cannot do anything about.0 comments0"

Grand MasterAnswered on 23 Sep 2019I have done my LASIK more than 15 years ago at Singapore National Eye Center SNEC.Ironically, it's a bit more expensive than private clinics, but I chose this ""public"" clinic for my Lasik back then for some reasons. (Btw, they are not really public in the sense that Lasik is more of a profit-generator for SNEC, you step in, you will realise the furnishing and customer service is more luxurious than usual)Back then I heard that private clinic tend to pack the schedule tightly for more profit and efficiency. Nothing wrong with that actually, its capitalism for efficiency.Just that I wasn't comfortable with it.2ndly, I heard that the latest technology and machine is usually at SNEC because they have the budget for the latest machines.Probably not true today... but back then, I can understand why the latest technology is always a lot more expensive for Lasik.Lasik is a life-changing experience. have fun waking up and searching for your glasses and realising you actually don't need it anymore... (you will take weeks to remember this)0 comments0"
