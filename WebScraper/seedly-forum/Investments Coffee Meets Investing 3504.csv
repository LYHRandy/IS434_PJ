1,"Marcus GohLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 21 Jul 2018You can use your age as a base to allocate your assets. A lot of people use this metric of (100 - Age) = % in equities.​E.g You are 25 years old. Based on the formula, you can park 75% in equities and the rest of the 25% split further into different assets class like high yielding savings account, Singapore Savings Bonds (SSB), Peer-to-Peer Lending and even Cryptocurrencies (if you truly believe in the price appreciation).0 comments1"
