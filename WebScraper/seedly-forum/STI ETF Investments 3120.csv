For $100 per month, you can look at different types of ETFs (commodities, equities, reits...) in foreign markets or use robo-advisors which can help you customise a diversified portfolio. SSB provides relatively well returns with it being guaranteed, although cannot compare to that of stocks. 0 comments0"
