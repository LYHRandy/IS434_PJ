1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 27 Mar 2019Yes it did.  Just after the announcments. Shares down 1.21%. Meanwhile, Roku up 4.68% and Netflix up 1.45%.Apple basically went listing the services they plan to go into, validating the streaming market- which benefitted Netflix in general. No surprise there. Roku went up with as it was made known AAPL's streaming service would be available on their TV devices. Update: The gains have evaporated in the subsequent trading day. Again the buy in was probably just headline traders adding short term volume. Apple Cards were a surprise however, building up on Apple Pay platform, although with the saturation of e-payments, Apple Pay has never been too attractive in the eyes of investors. No announcements concerning its traditional product line were announced.  Anything on Macbooks/new Final Cut Pros would have been loved by the the public. Magazines on iPad really??? Such a pity with all the hype for this.0 comments1"
