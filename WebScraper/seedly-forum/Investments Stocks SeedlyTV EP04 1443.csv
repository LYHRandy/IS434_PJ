question,"Investments Stocks SeedlyTV EP04 Asked by AnonymousAsked on 30 Apr 2019Where can I go to find out the main events affecting the singapore stock market today? I am curious to know what is causing the general market movements in the STI. With US stocks and some asian stock markets in japan or in hong kong, the main news sources usually provide some level of commentary or some pieces of news as to why it is moving the way it is. However, i rarely see such information for STI. How do you guys figure out what is causing the movements in the STI today.1 answerAnswerBump0"
