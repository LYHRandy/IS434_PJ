2,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Which online website were you shopping for the sport shoes? Online sites like Zalora & ASOS should be authentic, but others like Qoo10 or Lazada might not be. Did you do a ""background check"" on the seller - Checking out reviews of all the seller's product listings (Any bad comments, reading other people's Q&A Irresponsive, no after-sales service if there are defects/need to exchange size). As for the shoes sold at Queenstown, it should be authentic since it is illegal to sell counterfeits/replicas of trademarked goods in Singapore, pursuant to Section 49 of the Trade Marks Act.As a rule of thumb, if the price seems too good to be true, then it probably is. Meaning to say, if it claims to be authentic at a much cheaper price, then it probably is fake.2 comments1"
3,"Question Poster28 Oct 2018I often use Shopee. I also got a reply from a Carousell seller: Its factory overruns so basically they are straight from the factory and the quality is similar to factory outlet kinds just that there's minor differences and they aren't officially sanctioned by the shoe brand. What does it actually mean? Are they rejected goods?Gabriel Lee28 Oct 2018For Shopee, it's best to purchase from sellers under Shopee Mall to ensure it's authenticity. Check it out here - https://help.shopee.sg/hc/en-us/articles/115010119687-What-is-Shopee-Mall-  . As for the reply from the Carouseller, personally I would interpret it as an OEM/AAA (Overrun) product which is basically a nicer way of saying it's fake. I feel that so long as the product didn't come out from the official factory, it's fake. It's actually pretty surprising that nowadays, the fake/replica products look almost or exactly the same as the original ones. "

MasterUpdated on 28 Oct 2018Going by econs reasoning: Entire of Queenstown mall sells sports related goods including sports shoes, so in a sense there's many substitutes available (PED1). Sellers will want to lower price to attract buyers since an increase in price will lead to a more than proportionate decrease in quantity demanded.0 comments0"
