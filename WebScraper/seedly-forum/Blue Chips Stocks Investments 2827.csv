1,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 Feb 2019Sembcorp marine currently is trending at 1.58 to 1.63. This is due to uncertainty of the oil price and furthermore on the contracts to be awarded to them.Their free cashflow may be used to pay off debts and hence may not even have final dividend. Though we expect oil price to increase steadily towards $60USD which will bring back some profits next year. Its going to be a long term (2 years) if you Continue to be vested.Hopefully the rumour about acquisition is near and may help you to realise less losses (if there is a merger and acquisition). 0 comments1"

What was the idea ?Is your investment idea still valid? E.g if u invest for dividend, is the dividend there or is it cut or lowered?0 comments1"
