2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Aug 2019Look at the net gain or loss versus the amount you contributed. In this case, there is a gain of $345.61 over the contributed amount of $7,800. Returns is about 4.43% since October 2018. Not exactly fantastic since unit trusts do have a lot of fees involved... Do take note that fees are payable regardless of fund performance0 comments0"
