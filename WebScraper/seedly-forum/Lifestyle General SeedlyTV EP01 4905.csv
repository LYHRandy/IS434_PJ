1,"KKhrizLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 27 Mar 2019A want usually doesn't have an urgent timeline and you will regret it after purchase. So instead of using savings or investment funds to pay for a want, start a ""piggybank"" and save up specifically for it instead, eg to spend $5000 on a watch, you should save, say, $500 every month and only buy it after 10 months.Chances are, our interest in luxury items or ""wants"" will diminish over time, you cannot keep up with putting $500 aside every month, find it not worthwhile and abandon the idea altogether. In short just drag it out. But if after 10 months you managed to save up the $5000 and REALLY still want to buy, then go for it, because you earned it!0 comments3"
