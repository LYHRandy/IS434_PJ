1,Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 May 2019Value investing is a type of investment just like growth investing. Value investing prioritises on the value of the firm and invest when the price is reasonable or less than the book price. Each of us is different and may prefer different forms of investments. You should try some and decide which suits you best.0 comments0
