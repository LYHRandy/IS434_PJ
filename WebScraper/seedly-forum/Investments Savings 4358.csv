God of WisdomAnswered 1w agoHi anon,As you are still young, I would advise you to take time to gain knowledge first. There's no need to rush in at this point. Understand your options before you invest. Make sure your safety net is in place.Also, when you say 'global us markets', are you referring to US, or global? US market is about 50% global market cap, so if you invest in a global fund, there will be a significant proportion in US already. If you are referring to US strictly, you will have concentration risk.As your statement says, 'know more about investments', so please spend some time to pick up knowledge first before waiting. Time is still on your side.1 comment4"
2,"Question Poster1w agoHi, I am the one who asked this question an hour ago, do you know where to gain knowledge in the US, China, other global markets etc? I am not really interested in the SGX markets as Singapore market is too small for its returns which is obviously a ""no-brainer."" ðŸ˜…  Many thanks!"

You can consider buying ETFs that is Ireland domiciled. You can still get yourself exposed to US markets through buying Ireland domiciled ETF like VUSA for example.0 comments1
