1,"Dawn FionaLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 03 Mar 2019A market index like S&P500 or STI ETF could be a good place to look at and consider if it fits your investment objectives. These comprise of a basket of (mostly) blue-chip stocks which track the market returns and usually offer dividends. So that gives you lower risk than if you had invested in smaller or less known companies, and the passive income still comes to you in the form of dividend yield.0 comments0"

CPF is also another option but they are passive income only when you reach 65 years old.0 comments0"
