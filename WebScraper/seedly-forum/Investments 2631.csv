1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 26 Feb 2019Hello! Maybe I can just share some simple tips that I picked up here. The All Weather Portfolio is basically buying a portfolio of index funds with a specific percentage in stocks (30%), long-term bonds (40%), intermediate bonds (15%), commodities (8%) and gold (8%). ProsManaging Risks in different economic environmentsThe portfolio allocation is meant to help to hedge against different economic environments by having asset classes that react differently in the various economic conditions. When growth is rising and during inflationary periods, stocks and commodities will perform better while gold and bonds will not. When growth is dropping, bonds and gold will perform better while stocks won't do well. This benefit of helps the portfolio to pull through different economic cycles. Low correlation between asset classesThe assets are less correlated with each other. The make-up of the portfolio tries to spread the risk out across different asset classes such that risks that are unqiue to certain asset classes or industries are still spread out. Not letting your emotions get the better of youSince losses should tend to be limited and your volatility should be mitigated as well, this may prevent investors from getting too emotional or panicky when the market tanks. This could be conversely true when the market performs exceptionally well also. This may discourage investors from being too panicky or euphoric. ConsHistorically Lower Returns than the S&P 500The annual return from 1984 to 2013 was for S&P 500 was higher than the All Weather Porfolio. Annual returns for All Weather was 9.7%, while that for the S&P was 11.1%. However, it is also noteworthy that during the 2008 crisis, All Weather lost 3.93% compared to a loss of 37% of the S&P. Too much weight on bondsWith over 55% of the portfolio leaning on bonds, this could be too much, considering that the fed's interest rates have risen over the past few year. Such a phenomenon typically drives the prices of bonds down. 0 comments1"
