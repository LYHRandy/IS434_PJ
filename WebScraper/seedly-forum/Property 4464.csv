question,"Property Asked by AnonymousAsked on 05 Nov 2018First time HDB buyer, am considering resale instead of BTO due to location wise. Is it wise to go for resale flat as first time buyer?Considering that we will only get 10k grant for BTO with combined income. Seems like will get higher grant for resale flat with proximity and CPF grant. Budget for resale flat about 380,000 to 450,000.1 answerAnswerBump0"
