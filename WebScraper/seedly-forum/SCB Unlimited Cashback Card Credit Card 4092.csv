1,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 09 May 2018Depends on your spending needs.​Spree card has better cashback benefits for online and foreign transactions. It also has cashback cap but no minimum spend required.​Unlimited cashback is a flat cashback % for all spends but has no cashback cap and no minimum spend required too. ​So, if you spend alot online maybe consisder spree card. If you spend alot offline, maybe get the unlimited.​https://www.sc.com/sg/credit-cards/spree-credit-card/​https://www.sc.com/sg/credit-cards/unlimited-cashback-credit-card/0 comments1"
2,"Gigco WorkLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 01 Jul 2019It depends on your total spending AND how you pay for things.For me, I spend around $700/month.
Spree is good if:you pay using applepay or other mobile contactless (which will earn you 2%)you spend less than $3000/month because that's when you'll hit the $60 cashback cap.Unlimited is good if:you spend more than $4000/month because the unlimited rebate on all spending
Both cards have no minimum spending, which I love.0 comments0"
3,Stephanie NgLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 13 Jun 2018Personally I use Spree cos it's a higher cashback. For big purchases I will use Manhattan. So the unlimited cashback to me is like not here or there haha0 comments0
4,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 09 May 2018I think really based on your spending needs! As shared by Gabriel... It's between an unlimited 1.5% or the higher capped value.​However, for the higher capped value spree card,  it pales in comparison with other banks card eg DBS Live Fresh or the BOC Family card which offer up to 5-10% online spend and F&B spend. Do check them out :) ​We consolidated a few of them in an unbiased report here: ​https://blog.seedly.sg/the-ultimate-cheatsheet-best-cashback-credit-cards-for-working-adults-2018/0 comments0"
