question,"Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked on 29 Jan 2019What is your skincare routine?This feels more like a personal care than a personal finance qn. However, facial products are part of our expenses so I was just curious haha. What are the essentials to taking good care of your skin? How much do you spend on each product, and do you have any recommendations/tips?My daily routine includes washing my face with water (sometimes facewash), and occasionally putting face masks. I'm trying to find a 3-in-1 sunblock/sunscreen/moisturiser too (lazy to establish a multistep routine).1 answerAnswerBump1"
