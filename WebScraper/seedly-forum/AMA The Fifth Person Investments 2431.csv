3,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Always remember. In life, you are presented with tools. How you use them dictates the good and bad. Give a man a fish Instead of teaching them, you create dependency. Or you could give them 1 fish and ask them to create value from it (resell and repackage, make a cooked fish etc). Or even teach him to fish, if fishing is his intention.So for leverage, it's a tool that the wealthy commonly use. It's how the grow their wealth. However, its a difficult tool to use, because it magnifies whatever result that you get. E.g if you are a chef, you use the correct knife to cut the correct stuff. If you didn't take precaution, you cut your fingers (sometimes by accident). But with proper training and knowledge, the risk is reduced (having finger protection). So proper risk management (the skillset and knowledge) can help you to leverage (knife). 3 comments2"

5,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 Mar 2019Hi there!Leveraging isn't always bad - especially in stocks trading. Basically, what it does is that it magnifies your returns on your profitable trades, (and yes you've guessed it) as well as your losses on your non-profitable trades.Another function of leveraging is that on certain trading platforms such as Saxo Capital Markets, an investor will need to use leveraging to purchase derivatives such as Options & Futures. Moreover, one would need to use leverage in order to ""short sell"" a stock. However, as the others have mentioned and I would like to reiterate - leveraging is highly risky and one should never do speculative leveraging. Proper risk management can help to mitigate (but not entirely eliminate) these risks. For example: Adding a stop-loss order to your stocks that you purchased on leverage can prevent you from losing too much money in the event that the price of the stock does not go according to plan.0 comments1"

7,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Feb 2019Leverage is a double edged sword. Can be good if used wisely in investing. Personal examples for both sides of the edge. I took a loan from my insurance policies last year to channel towards my offshore account. 6% loan rate, but I'm creating a rate of return at 60% or more.Bad example would be back when I didn't know much about investing and took a balance transfer loan from my credit cards when I was offered the money by the bank. Invested in a reit which unfortunately didn't work out and I had to pay more at the end of the loan period. Southern province of China story: know when to leverage and when not to. If your investment can yield more than the cost of leveraging, go ahead. But don't bite off more than what you can chew. 0 comments1"

Smart leveraging is important. Without leveraging, we wouldn't have an economy.Leveraging on guaranteed assets creating arbitrage is good. Leveraging for speculation where you're risking more than your capital can be very bad.0 comments1"
