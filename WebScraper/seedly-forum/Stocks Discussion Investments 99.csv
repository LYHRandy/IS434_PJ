1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 15 Aug 2019Far East Orchard is a famous property developer in Singapore. Notable properties of the company include Novena Health Centre and Novena Specialist Centre. I had been to these 2 centres lately, and was quite impressed by the work of the firm. Here, I do a brief F-Piotroski analysis on the stock.
InputsThese numbers were taken from SGX and the annual report.
OutputBased on the F Score, it can be seen that Far East Orchard's financials have neutral financial health. This is because the firm's performance has slowed down lately, despite high profitability margins.
Personally, I would prefer to look at a stock with improving financial health, and cheap valuation. Although Far East Orchard's valuation is cheap, certain aspects of their financial performance is left to be desired.0 comments0"
