question,Bank Account General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 17 Aug 2018Anyone signed up for citi bank maxigain?I’m thinking of parking 30k-40k at Citi bank maxi gain and treat it as a high interest saving account aka just put and not touch it.  But I can’t find many reviews on it. After a year the annual interest is quite attractive compared to the CIMB 1%. Anyone is with Citi maxi gain? Can share your experiences? Can share if have any cons in signing up for it also? Thanks!2 answersAnswerBump0

1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 25 Aug 2019With Citi Maxigain for a year now and it's my favourite no-frills account! I parked a low six-figure there and have been enjoying the step-up interest that has been coming in. Have not touched it at all but I do see the statements coming in monthly.The main change that has come in last December is that the minimum daily ending balance of $70,000 is required, compared to the previous $15,000. So I would recommend putting in more.2 comments2"

3,"Isabella JoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 19 Aug 2018My favorite account which doesn't require salary crediting or credit card spend. Not sure why there's no product review for that in seedly.With the current sibor rate of 1.51175 (https://abs.org.sg/rates-sibor), even with counter 0 you are earning 1.2% (0.8*sibor). Monthly it will increase by 0.1% and after a year, u are looking at 2.4% interest. Go for it and open the account, and enjoy while the party lasts.There are rumors that there will be change in tnc, but so far nothing is confirmed. Also the other cons is if you withdraw more than previous month amount, your counter will drop. So treat this like a fixed deposit account. 0 comments2"
