1,"Gibson JunxunLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 02 Apr 2019I would think starting in Singapore would be the safer option given the close proximity you have with your investment, its very important at the start to know what youâ€™re putting your money into and starting in our local market can give you the experience needed to venture into other overseas market in the future.Even though our market may be small, we still have our fair share of investments instruments that you can venture into such as equities to REITS to ETFs and bonds.Wishing you a wonderful investing journey ahead!0 comments1"
2,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 02 Apr 2019Hello!I think that it would be good to do a mixture of investing in both overseas as well as in Singapore as this will mean that your portfolio will be more diversified.If you do not know much about investment when starting out, I would suggest investing in Singapore such as SSB since it carries rather low risks as it is fully backed by the government. You may also consider investing in ETFs thorugh regular savings plan that banks in Singapore offer. After being more familiar with investments, investing in S&P 500 maybe a better choice since it has been shown to give higher returns historically.Should you decide to invest overseas, loooking at the US markets would be a good choice since they are known for its safe-haven investments, like Treasury bonds and blue chip companies. Other overseas markets include BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) since these countries are known for their growth opportunities.Hope this helps!0 comments1"

SG equities don't give me hope for much long-term prospects.0 comments0"
