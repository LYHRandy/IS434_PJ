1,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 Mar 2019Recently I've gone to the Singapore Asset Management Conference in 2019, and the insights given by the J.P Morgan leaders there regarding the JPM coin is that it's more to tap on their blockchain opportunity to reduce the cost of their transactions fees etc. , perhaps not so much of creating a cryptocurrency. In fact, most of the crypto community don't even consider it a crypto currency at all, and it's not really available for retail investors like us anyway, at least at this stage.It shouldn't have a effect on your decision to buy Bitcoin or not. Bitcoin is a totally different thing altogether from JPM coin, fundamentally speaking their purpose is quite far apart. Right now, Bitcoin is relatively bottoming out around 3.7k USD, but it may continue like this for quite some time, since there isn't much big news surrounding it at thispoint in time. But to reach it's previous highs, I really think it's a stretch.0 comments0"
