1,"Vicky FaithLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019When I was 10 years old, I told myself not to take my dad (only breadwinner) money and be independent.I started with buying and selling some pens and tooth brush through door to door sales to earn 50 cents for each item I sell, then I worked in Action City at about 13 years old to give gift wrapping service for 3.5 bucks or 4 bucks per hour, then i work in a f and b restaurant (my part time job that last me till I grad from uni) for 4.5 bucks per hour. While holding my f and b job, I took up 2nd and 3rd job to make full use of my time. I work in a coffee place that pays about 8 bucks per hour and able to work overnight shift. I work on a puzzle retail place and earn 6.5 per hour. I work which ever place that has available slot for me. But while I do all these, I forgotten one thing. I forgotten to communicate with my dad. I forgotten to ask him how he heart ache seeing me working day and night for school fees when he had left a sum of money for me to complete my studies. I forgotten to have proper meals with him. As someone working part time, I earned near to 14k per year but I saved none. Because I have no idea how to save money and splurge on whatever I felt that I want it.  Also, I missed out what most people would experience as a primary school, a secondary school, a polytechnic and a uni student because my mind was all about earning money to prove my independence to someone who dont need me to prove it If you want to work, theres many places which you can work at, especially the service industry, like what many mentioned. But before that, speak to your parent and ask what he/she thinks first. If he/she is agreeable for you to try part time job, find out how you can schedule and balance things out so you will never lose out the moments for you to spend with your parent. I'm fortunate that my dad is still around and I'm able to make up the lost time with him since I'm working adult now. But I definitely regretted focusing too much on earning money when I was young and missed out so much things. Not discouraging you because I believe working part time will allow you to gain experience you dont get to learn in school or at home. But its important to balance the priorities:) good luck! :) 6 comments21"

If you have just graduated, you can look for part time job on sites like GumTree, Indeed, Jobstreet and more. Do watch out whether the post is by a recruitment company, there'll help you secure a job but at the cost of a fraction of your salary (from the employer). Alternatively, you can write in to companies/businesses for part time work opportunity.If you are still studying, I would advise not getting distracted. While studying seems boring and tedious, it's opens up many options for you in the future. Let's not be too blinded by short term rewards and forget about long term plans.0 comments5"

WonderkidAnswered on 03 Dec 2018You're the min legal age, so apart from tutoring, you can find part-time jobs in the retail, sales, F&B industries etc. Do try apps for informal /casual work like GrabJobs, or even Carousell. Do be aware of jobs promising easy money at a high pay, you don't want to unwittingly become a money mule or do illegal or immoral stuff.Some may not pay high, but contributing to CPF will allow you to start accumulating a decent rate of compound interest early and nurture interest in learning about investing, and money management.You also get to hone other important skills like sales, teamwork and communications.Pick something you enjoy or would like to try, whether it is tutoring, sales, florist help, or even flyer distribution/banqueting to exercise.But when full-time studies resume, remember go focus on studies again! Check out your community centre for CCC-CDC bursaries, and your school which might be able to offer assistance as well.Studies ultimately come first at this time, get your degree and you'll have a higher salary and more earning potential in the long run. It is easy to get attracted by short term gains so yoi gotta stay focused!Hope this helps0 comments4"

If you have a particular skill, flower arrangement or cooking or coding etc or interest, try to pursue that to earn an income. Make sure you know your rights and don't be taken for a ride. All the best0 comments3"
9,"ZeeeeeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 04 Dec 2018I feel that you should focus on your studies as much as you can to ease the burden on your mum by getting a full uni scholarship so she won't have to fund your further studies:) but if you're able to cope with studies, go ahead and look for a part time job as well0 comments1"
