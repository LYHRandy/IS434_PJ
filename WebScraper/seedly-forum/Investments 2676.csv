1,Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Feb 2019It really depends on how long the trend will be staying for. Will it be a passing trend? Also depends on how the company/companies involved plan to sustain consumer's interests in their products and how they plan to differentiate themselves from competitors!0 comments1
2,"Isaac ChanLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 23 Feb 2019Lol did anyone hear of Mala listcos before other than HDL? Would be quite interesting to see how such a stock can actually perform on the exchange.Personally, I think it would be quite tough for a company specializing in Mala to grow and become listed like HDL. It would probably need to differentiate itself in other ways like HDL did in the hotpot space, with the excellant service and lots of complimentary services also. Its also quite common to find Mala now in SG with some outlets that are quite good. Tough market to compete in. 0 comments1"
