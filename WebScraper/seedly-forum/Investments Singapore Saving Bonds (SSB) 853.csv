You can also leave your money in the SSB till maturity (10years)To invest in SSB, you will need a CDP account and link your bank account. You can then apply for SSB through your bank account Every month the SSB is open for application for you to invest. (For example you apply for the SSB this month, issue date will be aug 2019 and first interest payment will be credited to your bank account on Feb 2020)
Interest is given subsequently every 6 months. You can refer to the interest table as interest varies with every issuance.Do note that there is $2 for application fee and $2 charges for early withdrawal.0 comments1"
