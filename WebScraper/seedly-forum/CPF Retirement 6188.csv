1,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 May 2019Actually no need to worry about hitting Retirement Sum. You also should take into consideration potential income increase and your annual bonuses if any.On top of which, pledging your property as a collateral is a viable option too. You can also consider topping up your SA account0 comments0"
2,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered on 03 May 2019Yes most probably. You can expect FRS to grow by about 5-6k every year or so.So that'll be 276-296k in 20 years.And don't worry, you'll still be able to do a property pledge if you don't hit FRS.0 comments0"
