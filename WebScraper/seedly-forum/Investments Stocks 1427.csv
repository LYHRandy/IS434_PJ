1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 May 2019Personally I use Td Ameritrade. Great platform, not too difficult to use for both desktop and mobile app versions. No custodian fees, no inactivity fees and no data feed fees. Great charting system built in as well. I use it mainly for options and a bit of stock on the side if I need to.0 comments1"
