1,"Daniel Lee, Independent Retirement Planner at Promiseland Independent Pte LtdLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 14 Jun 2019In my opinion, a university is a good platform to expose yourself to things that you didn't know previously. But it really isn't the best place to learn certain things such as marketing or entrepreneurship.A lot of concepts such as copywriting and sales are often not taught to students (or at the very least not to my awareness) and for topics like marketing, alot of the concepts are slowly being outdated. You will be better off trying to pick up the skills necessary by reading books and self-learning.
The only problem is that you don't know what you don't know so unless you are already out there doing it and facing a problem, you will never know what you will need to provide you with the solution.0 comments1"
2,MujimoroLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 14 Jun 2019Got a few colleagues at my company who are PhDs and are absolute trash when it comes to work. We’ve had interns - undergrad interns! - who were much more productive. It’s attitude that counts. Teach your kids to work hard. A degree doesn’t count for much otherwise.0 comments1
3,"Jennifer GohLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 14 Jun 2019A degree is a gateway to enter the world of sucess but it doesn't guarantee success. Success in life requires a lot more things like skills, experience and grit.Just my two cents :)
