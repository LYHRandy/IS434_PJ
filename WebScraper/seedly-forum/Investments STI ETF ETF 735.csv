The best time is now.No one will know exactly when the market will go down. So the best is to stay invested and stick to your investment strategy and rebalance your portfolio accordingly. You may also want to keep a “war chest” to put in more monies when you think the opportunity has arrive. Also good to seek professional advice when you are unsure too0 comments3"
