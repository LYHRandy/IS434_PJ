1,"Dhruv Arora, Founder & Chief Executive Officer at SyfeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 5. GeniusUpdated on 02 Sep 2019Hi Nicholas, thanks for your interest in Syfe! Allow me to add on to what David has shared. Syfe’s key strength lies in our proprietary Automated Risk-managed Investments (ARI) methodology. ARI combines two of the world’s leading investment approaches and is built by a team of academics, technologists and former bankers.ARI creates your portfolio by allocating assets which have shown the best return for your risk profile. But more importantly, it continually monitors your portfolio. During periods where higher market volatility has been forecasted, ARI will adjust your portfolio allocation and reduce your exposure to higher-risk asset classes. This ensures your portfolio risk stays aligned to your desired risk level. Conversely, during periods of market calm, ARI will adjust your portfolio allocation to include more higher-risk assets so your overall portfolio risk is kept in line with your desired risk exposure but you get to capture the market upside as well. The result is that ARI helps you achieve benchmark-beating returns by maintaining your desired risk level, no matter what market conditions may be - just as a real wealth manager should do for you, round the clock. If you would like to know more about Syfe, do feel free to drop by our weekly investing workshops. I’d be happy to chat with you regarding your investing goals so you can make a more informed decision.0 comments6"
2,"David MorganLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 01 Sep 2019Hello! Yup, I’ve heard of it and used it as well. Syfe is a similar Robo-advisor like Stashaway and Autowealth. It’s good for newBies and veteRans as well. As usual, when you are starting off like some platforms, you will need to go through their Risk Profiler and then their ARI ( Automated- Risk smth smth) will then allocate investments based on your risk profile. Their Automated will monitor your profile/portfolio. In case of any Low/High Volatile market news that has happened such as speculations of “recession”,  bearish/bullish News and etc, they will adjust your portfolio and tune it to the market frequency. This allows your portfolio risk to stay afloat and not crash and burn. But before you put both feet into the water, make sure to put one of your feet in to test the water as you can never control how the investment returns are and to control the cost that will eat into your returns. And before you put that one foot into the water, please do some thorough research and acquire some knowledge first and be truly understand what you are venturing into. If one finds it’s too much trouble to know the value of something, then investing might not be suitable for one. Best of luck!0 comments6"
