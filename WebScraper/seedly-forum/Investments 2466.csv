1,"Leong Wen Fong, Community Lead at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hmm, don’t really agree with some parts of Enk Loui’s answer.Much of what I learnt on the Q&A is that it’s not really about how much you have before you start investing, but more like how well you are covered. Generally the advice is that you should at least have 6-12 months worth of expenses saved as emergency savings.If you are beginning to invest, I do feel that even if you have $100 spare a month, or $500 now, you can still invest using RSPs (Regular Savings Plan) or SSB. Granted, they may not have the best returns, but I assume from this question that you are just beginning to invest, and this is a good start.In fact, I recommend that you start sooner, and with a smaller amount. Let it kick start the habit of investing, rather than waiting for a big amount - it will be harder mentally then.1 comment3"

3,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 Mar 2019Hello there,From my personal experience as a budding retail investor, I think there are a few perspectives you can approach this from:Generally as a rule of thumb, I personally think that 5,000 to 10,000 is a good gauge. I'm sure many would have differing opinions so feel free to chime in!1) Monthly Contribution to Blue Chip StocksIn this case, there is no ""good amount"" per se but its good that to have a steady cash flow such as income, to invest a certain amount of money into buying blue chip stocks; such as through the RSS plans, which allow investors to start investing in the Singapore Exchange (SGX) from as little as $100 a month, which is highly beneficial for those who have limited knowledge/confidence.2) Personal Savings of ~5,000 to 10,000 and you want to invest in growth stocks/bonds without much tradingIn this case, an investment of around 5,000 to 10,000 would give you a good exposure to stocks that have profitable business models and solid financial health (after conducting your own research to ascertain if that is the case), and to diversify your portfolio. Currently, this is what I'm doing and of course, 5,000 to 10,000 is an arbitrary amount and may differ from person A to person B. It is an amount that I feel that I'm comfortable with; especially to ensure that I have enough liquidity in my bank account for other things.3) Personal Savings ~3,000 to 5,000 and you want to invest in derivatives such as CFDs Using the typical leverage ratio of 1:5, where 3,000 to 5,000 in investments could give you up to 15,000 to 25,000 in exposure, this would be a good amount (i feel) for investors to start, if you are looking at investing in CFDs and have solid knowledge as well as risk management. (HOWEVER THIS IS NOT ADVISABLE FOR COMPLETE BEGINNERS). Hope that helps!0 comments2"

MasterAnswered on 05 Mar 2019Hello!I think that a good amount to start investing in will depend on your current situation such as your salary and the amount of savings that you have. Since it is different for everyone, there is unlikely to be an answer to this. I would personally start investing with smaller amounts such as $100 each month in ETFs as i build up more knowledge on investing then proceed to increase my risk appetite as well as the amount of money im investing in.0 comments0"
5,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 05 Mar 2019If you intend to start with Regular savings plans or Roboadvisors, then a small commitment of $100 a month is good for starters.If you intend to pick your own stocks, I would say about $3-5k for your first stock purchase. This is so that the transaction cost will not be such a huge % of your purchase. Try to be cost efficient.I would not recommend any leverage or margin products for starters.0 comments0"
