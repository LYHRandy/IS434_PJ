question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked 3w agoIs there insurance to cover car rental users?Partner got into a minor accident while driving a rented car. Slight bang to the car (Grab) in front; minor dent to Grab's bumper. No other scratches, no visible damage to the rented car.  Took photos, exchanged details, made reports.Rented car demanded $6K due to 'in excess insurance clause' & to sign off all liabilities from 3rd party.  We checked with other sources (workshop, police, other rental co) - all said you pay what you sign for.  Expensive lesson learnt.1 answerAnswerBump0"

Grand MasterAnswered 3w agoYeah, there is insurance that you can pay for when you rent a car.The car rental agency is usually happy for you to sign the insurancecovers the usage of rental car with EXCESS (or deductible) payable by the rentercovers everything, including excess.2 is obviously a more expensive premium as it covers the entire bill... Most car rental agencies can't offer 2 because not many Singaporean will opt for this. They think this is a way for car rental and insurance firms to earn more (they do earn more...)Excess of $6000 for the car bill is not uncommon. Though I strongly suspect the bill is marked up a lot by the car workshop since its ""paid by insurance and excess"" and the car rental firm probably can't care (not their money)I am not sure what you can do though, its a big, long problem in car workshop and insurance.3 comments0"

SG wise its difficult. Agree with you that its a big hassle at car workshop :(Rai Hanah M2w agoThank You!"
