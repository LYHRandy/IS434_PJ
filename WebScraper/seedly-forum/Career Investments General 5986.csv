question,"Career Investments General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 04 Sep 2018I’m in my 20s, still studying, are there any value-adding part-time jobs in the banking sector? I've already started investing on STI ETF, and I'm looking into robo-advisors next. Should I enter in lump-sum or DCA? How should I take my next step?I’m in my 20s, still studying. Particularly Economics and Finance from a private university. Already started on STI ETF through RSP, looking into robo advisory next. However, should one enter robo advisory in lump sum or DCA? Also, where are some good places to look for value-added part-time jobs such as in the banking sector? I have school on every Monday and Tuesday, will I be able to find one? Or even where to find internships during my holidays? Lastly, i hope there’s someone who could mentor me or someone who are interested in investment that can impart some knowledge.4 answersAnswerBump1"

MasterAnswered on 19 Sep 2018Hello.​Generally for any kind of investments, replicated studies have shown lump sum to yield higher than DCA 2/3rds of the time, which is consistent with the fact that the market is genenrally a lot more in upswing than downswing.​For someone your age, I'd honestly encourage you to invest a lot more aggressively than the STI ETF and Robos. I actually wrote a detailed article on it here, seeing as your last question implies that you still consider yourself inexperienced in this area. https://www.moneymaverickofficial.com/​There are good places to intern at Insurance Companies, quite frankly speaking. No one will force you to commit and you can understand the many aspects of being autonomous and running your own business - the hours it takes, branding, sales techniques, business management, budgeting, etc.​Investing is my specialty. I made 32.7% overall last year, which is double digits more than both the STI and the SNP500. India performed particularly well for me, at 49.6%. If you would like to consider diversifying your portfolio, as well as someone to learn investment skills from, you can always drop me a PM.​https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments2"

Determine the holdings % of each and see whether is it worth investing at that them. You'll need to select the risk profile and you'll be able to see from that risk profile what they are investing in. side note only used smartly before. Other robo-advisors no. 0 comments1"
3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Mm what sort of part time role are you looking to get in the banking industry? Such roles may be limited to menial roles like administrative ones which may not add much value. You can try looking out for available roles via banking websites' career pages, or headhunting sites like jobstreet. ​Internships wise, your school should be able to link you up with good internships that you can work on during your holidays. Youor school should be able to provide some form of advice in terms of choosing one as well.​Investments wise, what is your goal / objective when it comes to investing? There must be one in mind, like investing for retirement, or to achieve a milestone so that it can be used to pay off a big ticket item in future (wedding, house, etc). ​If you can afford to, try attending investment workshops that are available out there. This can form your main portfolio and you won't need to look anywhere else. I went for one 2 years ago on selling options and never looked back. Benchmark for this is 30% p.a. compounded every year. ​Hope this helps4 comments1"
