Infact, it all started from Mr. Bezos who fell in relationship with other woman and so has to face this today. I guess these things are very common in the US. Mackenzie is a very lucky lady. Not everyone is so lucky. Yes, she made such huge fortunes without any struggle but it was all legal in the end. Even Mr. Bezos has no complaints from the settlement deal. He was quite happy as can be seen in this tweet - 0 comments2"

WizardAnswered on 05 Apr 2019It's their marriage and hardwork together while building Amazon, taking care of family / household etc. So if the marriage didn't sustain or work out, she also deserve her fairshare of monetary rewards for her hardwork. Either way, losing marriage and just have split wealth(instead of join wealth), I do not see it as a gain but rather a lost.0 comments0"
3,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 05 Apr 2019I kind of diasgree with your statement on how it puts to shame the hard work of other women. I believe that attaining a good amount of wealth requires hard work, but a lot of luck as well. Even Warren Buffet agrees that he was quite lucky, in that he was born in the right era and his skills were valuable to the economy and society.Personally, I really think that a lot of where we end up in life is circumstantial, and some people are just luckier than others. Divorcing from her husband might have landed her a windfall, but some people are also born into wealthy families, born with exceptional talents or just born in the right era with the right skills. To spin the argument around, some hardworking people may not develop wealth or success too, but I don't think that discounts the value of hardwork either.Having that amount of wealth may not be that great either for Mackenzie, since she is now under a lot of public scrutiny and criticism for leaving her husband just for his wealth. So she wins some but loses too.0 comments0"
