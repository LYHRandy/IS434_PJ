1,"Billy Ko, President - Investment Club at Singapore Institute Of TechnologyLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi David!Thank you for your question. And similarly as what others have mentioned, applicable means differently to different people. Depending on your risk appetite, your own beliefs and views on which industries are set to grow and evolve. There are many factors that would affect the suitability of different stocks to different individuals.Also, I noticed you are someone really inquisitive with the many questions posed to the forum members here. I really do appreciate your questions and am sure that Seedly and the other forum members feel the same way too :) But just a spark of curiosity, have you started investing and if not, what is holding you back? Once again, thank you for your activeness in this forum, I'm certain many others have indeed learnt from your questions as well!2 comments1"

God of WisdomAnswered on 02 Apr 2019What does applicable mean to you?I think beginners shouldn't pick stocks especially when index replication and diversification is so easily available through index funds and ETFs.0 comments1"
