1,"Lim Chun Long Jimmy, Distributor at Newbrand Organic Green TeaLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 15 Sep 2018Not applying risk management.​E.g. If each trade's risk is 1% of your capital, you need to lose 277 consecutive trades to blow up your trading account balance. Combining this risk management with a profitable trading strategy, you should not blow up your trading account balance.0 comments0"

3,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 15 Sep 2018I am not exactly a day trader but I did trade previously.​Biggest mistake was always trading on impulse emotionally. When you see extremely fast and volatile movement, you think ""shit I better not miss this profit"". Entered the trade. Next day, saw stop loss triggered.​Another mistake is to close trades prematurely. See the price coming very close to your stop loss. Then you say ""aiya close earlier, make lesser loss"". Next day you see the price chiong liao...profit if you had not closed.0 comments0"
