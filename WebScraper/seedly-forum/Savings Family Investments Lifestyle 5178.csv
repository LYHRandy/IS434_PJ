question,"Savings Family Investments Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked on 31 Jul 2019Would it be better to convert to a gold certificate, if at all that's possible?I'm an Indian & inherited gold jewellery during my marriage. I don't think I would wear most of it. These jewellery have ""making charges"", meaning they don't get its worth in value if converted to cash. I don't have any urgent need for money, but am looking for alternatives. Is keeping it like that going to help or should I convert it into a gold certificate/gold bars/something else? Gold substantially increases in value is what everyone says, but I would like to know the truth behind that.1 answerAnswerBump0"
