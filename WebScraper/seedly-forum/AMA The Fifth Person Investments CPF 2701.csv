1,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 15 Feb 2019It is very hard to say. We have been in a super low interest rate environment globally, with more money printing than ever. However, I do think that for Singapore's growth it has already peaked and will not be able to sustain the same level of economic growth as past generations. This means that the ability of our state investment funds to grow is very limited. There must be a sustainable rate of growth to give out guaranteed CPF interests and in the current state, even a guaranteed 4% is extremely extremely rare.0 comments1"

3,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 16 Feb 2019The OA will not decrease. 2.5% is the legislated minimum rate. The rate will be the legislated min or the 3-month local bank interest rate whichever is higher. I do not see the local bank rates will ever exceed 2.5% barring extreme situation. Take note the rate is based on interets rate local bank pay depositers, not the interbank rate. Blood sucker banks will not raise deposit rates to so high unless the interbank rate is much much higher.The SMA will also be unlikely to decrease. 4% is the current floor. But there is chance for the rates to increase, as it is based on the higher of the floor rate or 10yr sgs + 1%. Current 10year sgs is 2.3+%. That makes it about 3.3+%. In a higher inflationary environment, the 10yr has a good chance to reach 3%. In the 90s, 10yrs were in the 4% plus, but since the turn of millenium, they went under 3% since. Only briefly hitting above 3% in the early 2000.It will be political suicide to reduce the rates I do not forsee that happening. There also isnt a need to reduce (if political power is prime consideration). If it were to really be lowered, there would likely be very strong reasons to do that. And that will take a brave politician to do that in the interest of the nation.0 comments0"

It'll never increase.The guarantees provided by our government are expensive and getting harder to fulfill.For CPF to remain sustainable, there'll be more limits to how much OA can be used for housing and a higher Full Retirement Sum plus delayed payout for CPF Life.0 comments0"
