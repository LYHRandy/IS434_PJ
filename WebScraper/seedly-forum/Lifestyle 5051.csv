MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi Yixuan!I can't say for sure what your expectations are, so I'm going to suggest 2 that I'm familiar with:Wah Lok Restaurant at Carlton.They have great service (better have) but is pretty expensiveNote: If you go there, you have to get their Bo Luo Bun. It's AMAZING.Soup RestaurantThis one is more common, and cheaper. However, it's still a decent place and their service is pretty good as well. Note: if you go there, you MUST ABSOLUTELY order their samsui chicken. Their ginger sauce is (unhealthy) to die for.Both restaurants servce chinese type of food, and considering that your grandma might not want to travel around so much, or might not want  you to spend a bomb, I would definitely recommend Soup Restaurant!2 comments1"
