Personally I have not known anyone doing this. Both the banks and the insurance company must approve you holding a position both companies.
There must also be no conflict of interests, etc. You may want to check with the bank you are currently working for first.0 comments4"

WizardAnswered on 30 May 2019I really think it's best that you check with the bank that you have the full time employment with - banks in particular deal with alot of private information, and it's important to see that there are no conflicts of interest.0 comments2"

If you do, you need to declare to your full-time company (will you even want to do that?) And after the declaration, what do you think will be the response of your boss? (will he allow you to part-time somewhere else?) And if the answer from him is ""no"", have you practically ruin your chance to stay in the bank for long (will your boss start looking for a replacement and fire you once he gets one)?Lastly, you will need to be licenced to represent the insurance company, and the licence requirement is that you only represent one principal (the insurance company in this case).  So, you now work full-time at the bank, while you fully represents the insurance company.
So yes, your finding it puzzling is correct, the recruiter is just trying all means to get you in for strange reasons.0 comments0"
