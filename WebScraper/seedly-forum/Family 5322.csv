1,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019measure it while she is sleeping? use a string. Just to get an approximate. Or if she has any of her own rings? U can take measurements/photos(on a measuring tape) of that. With an approximate the jewelsmith will usually size it just slightly bigger. So try to find the best approximate u can. As Yang Teng mentioned, u can get it resized afterwards.1 comment1"
