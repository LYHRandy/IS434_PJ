1,"Dylan TeoLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 12 Jul 2018There are a few commonly used ones, but I strongly recommend Tradably!​Tradably's mission is to bring transparency and accountability to the investments space. This is done by tracking all ideas provided on the platform and tying them to actual market-values in real-time. Also, ideas shared on the platform are normally accompanied by TP, SL, timeframe, allocation and analysis.​The result is that you get ideas that are very actionable, that also come from trusted investors with a track record you can see for yourself. Talk about transparency!0 comments3"
