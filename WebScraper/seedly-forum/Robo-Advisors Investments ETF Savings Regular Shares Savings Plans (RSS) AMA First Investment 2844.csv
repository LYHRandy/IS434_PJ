1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 29 Jan 2019If you are looking to increase your net worth by about 100k over 4 years at an ideal rate of 8% roi pa, you are looking at a principal amount of $72~k to invest with. If your emergency savings is enough to cover about 6 months' worth of expenses, you can look to plough all available free cash flow into investments. If you are not investment savvy, consider using robo advisories though returns may not meet your desired roi. Book wise, consider the intelligent investor for a start. Learn to Earn or money: master the game may be good alternatives. As an alternative consideration, consider going through an investment workshop to learn more about investing and pick up a life long skill. You can then diy and potentially reach better returns on your portfolio. Hope this helps 0 comments1"
