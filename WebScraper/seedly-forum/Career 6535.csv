This is your ideal situation. If you're here, why are you considering to leave?2. Bad Boss, Bad Company: Move on as soon as you can, as amicably as you are able to. It will always be best to have another job lined up before you leave.3. Good Boss, Bad Company: You can learn a lot from you boss despite the bleak future of your company. Focus on building your network and strong, perservering work relationships with colleagues and leverage on it to find a more fulfilling job before quitting.4. Bad boss, Good Company: You still do have room to grow. Similarly, here, build your skills and focus on becoming a more desirable, employable employee, while you make new connections and expand your network with finding a new job in mind.Feel free to meet up with me to discuss further :) Contact me here: https://cherietan.typeform.com/to/wdlOfu0 comments2"

The two times I quit without having the next job lined up, I was able to find another job within 1-3 months. But it took me six months last year  before I got the current job.

WonderkidAnswered on 10 Jan 2019hahha, it's always easy to throw the letter, find a job first before tendering.that said, if in your industry you find you keep getting rejected after citing your two months' notice period, you should consider quitting without any offer but at least have some interviews lined up.0 comments0"
