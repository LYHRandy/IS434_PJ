1,"CYClare YeoLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 03 Sep 2019As far as I know, OCBC N90 card does not charge conversion fee when you convert your points to mileage but Citi does. The downside for OCBC is you can only convert to Krisflyer miles while Citi has a lot more airline partners. However, if you only intend to convert to Krisflyer miles, then the OCBC card makes more sense since there is no conversion fee.0 comments2"

3,"EEvelynLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Sep 2019Out of curiosity... are you in time to get a credit card for spending next weekend even? Anyway,
I personally use Citibank PM card, for these following reasonsmore airlines partner (like Cathay and Qatar). You must consider if you can even find the ideal award flights in SQ and also the points needed. For example, Qatar requires more miles than Cathay for the flights/routes I’ve redeemed so far! 2x priority pass lounges per year! OCBC N90 doesn’t offer that but I believe you can pay a discounted rate for itand if you ever decide on using Citibank PM, I will recommend you to pay the annual fees to get the 10k miles! It’s definitely worth it!2 comments1"

Haha my Citibank PM was a few years back. I did it at the branch itself but am quite sure I got it by post that’s why! Thanks for your info too!
