1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Sep 2019Decent yield in a US context. But don't forget that as residents here we are subject to a 30% withholding tax on dividends received. So it's not really favourable to us. Better yield can be had with S-REITs. I may relook at this once I'm retired and if this fund can consistently increase its dividend for 25 years or more. On a side note that the article's headline is rather misleading... Seems to imply that you can retire using 100k invested in this fund and get a payout of 2.7k per month... This payout rate can be achieved and I'm aiming to do so with an options portfolio with 100k but NOT with just 100k invested in RQI...0 comments0"
