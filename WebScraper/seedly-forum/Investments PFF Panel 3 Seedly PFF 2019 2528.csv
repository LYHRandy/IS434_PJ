1,"Dawn FionaLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 03 Mar 2019Read about the different types of strategies.Evaluate to see which one fits into your lifestyle and preference best.Learn more about that style (through books or courses) and apply it.Many people start with income investing because it is earlier to pick up, but may move to value or growth investing later on as they develop and refine their own investment processes. It really is up to you.0 comments0"
