We actually saw this Acorns model before and also considered creating something like this for the Singapore/SEA market.
However, what we found was that the numbers were not that meaningful as the spare change idea may work in the west but not here.I think the closest thing we have to this in this part of the world are robo-advisors.Which right now there are close to 5 or 6 in the market, where you start with at least $100. (which is a really low requirement to begin with)
The backbone of Acorns and Robo advisors in this space are the same thing, if i am not wrong, market traded ETFs which track indexes around the world.You can find all the Robo Advisors and read their reviews here: https://seedly.sg/reviews/robo-advisorsIn Singapore, here is the process for signing up to invest with a Robo Advisor:First, the robo advisor will collect information from the investor to understand the risk appetite, investment time horizon, future goals and financial situation that the investor is in.Once the above is done, investor will be assigned one of the robo advisor's portfolio that best suits the investor.The investor can then fund the account. This can be done either through a lump sum or monthly option.The robo advisor will then monitor the market, rebalance the portfolio if need be.As most of these are done with the help of algorithm, investors cannot actively choose to allocate their investment different from the fixed portfolio provided.Currently there are a few major Robo-advisors in Singapore.They are mainly:StashAwayAutoWealthSmartlyPhillip SMART PortfolioFSMOne MapsMoneyOwlSyfe0 comments0"
