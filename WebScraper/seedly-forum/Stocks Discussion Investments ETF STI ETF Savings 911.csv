1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 28 Jun 2019ETF/Funds are just tools. Look to build a global portfolio as a strategy instead.
This means exposure to every developed market as well as emerging markets.You can do this by buying a simple All Country World Fund or choose individual funds that invests in a single country or continent.
So figure out your strategy before going into the tools to help you pull off that strategy. Some want concentration in only US market, some want an all weather portfolio (almost always make money even if markets are bad kind of portfolio), some want a Deep Value portfolio only made up of small cap stocks from developed markets.All these are strategies and portfolio considerations. Do this first.1 comment3"

3,"Harvey TanLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 28 Jun 2019Since you are new, I would advise you to read some investment books first before diving into any investment. Google for ben graham and john bogle.I will not comment on performance since past future performance is hardly an indicator of future performance. Some suggestions for you for you to start somewhere.Total US market -- Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF VTI - TER of 3bpTotal World market -- Vanguard Total World ETF VT - TER of 9bpTotal China market -- iShares Core MSCI China Index ETF 2801.HK - TER of 39bp The funds that i have listed above, track the market and hence you gain the market return. In layman terms, if the general economy do well, the fund will do well.FYI. VTI and VT are listed on NYSE and 2801.HK is listed on Hong Kong Stock Exchange.0 comments0"
