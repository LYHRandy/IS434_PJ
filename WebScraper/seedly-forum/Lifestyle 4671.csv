1,Jessica Ann LeeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 29 Aug 2019Not worth it. SPH news is outdated usually by the time it appears in print. The online version is only a little faster but still slower than international news agencies.Most of the information is free on the internet OR available in premium international branded subscriptions which can be actually cheaper.0 comments2

News is like a commodity today and there are a ton of various free sources online for you to consume information, be it in print, audio, image or video.You should just subscribe to some news sources on facebook and like their pages etc. What I would pay for are:AudiobooksReportsIn depth analysisOf which, many you can also find ways to make it free (eg Podcasts!) I love listening to a variety of podcasts on apple podcasts or spotify.And even the NLB app allows you to download audiobooks for free nowadays as well.0 comments0"
