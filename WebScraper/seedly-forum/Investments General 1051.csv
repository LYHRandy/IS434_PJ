1,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 Jun 2019The decision seems more political than practical; with Mahatir's support for the gold backed currency during the '95 Asian Financial Crisis and the recent support for Huawei against the US. More recently, Malaysia was placed on US watchlist of currency manipulation.Currently, the US dollar is used as a comparison since many countries have trading partnership with them. The change is supposed to increase investor's confidence since the currency is not susceptible to manipulation (e.g artificially inflate away debts). Another jab at the US. However there are limitations with a gold standard. The size and health of the economy is entirely dependent on the gold supply (Malaysia is not known for it's gold mining). Monetary policy (increase/reduce money supply) to change interest rate will no longer work. Malaysia, with a sizeable portion of its GDP under consumption, will have more issues since implementing fiscal stimulus when consumer sentiment is lacklustre is rather improbable.0 comments0"
