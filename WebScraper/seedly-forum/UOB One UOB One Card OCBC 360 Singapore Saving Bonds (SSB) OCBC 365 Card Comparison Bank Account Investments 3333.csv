Then the rest you can put into SSB. If you can hit the conditions for High(e.g. 3%) interest, you can consider just putting in the savings account itself. 0 comments1"

If yes, then putting it in a high interest savings account is better. If you can leave the money untouched for years, then I'd suggest getting the SSBs :)0 comments0"
