1,"Jessica Ann LeeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 05 Sep 2019Anytime Fitness is great because you don't have to pay monthly, you can pay as you go.If you need a trainer, I suggest googling for those freelancer personal trainers in Singapore.They are usually lower fees and they can be more flexible (because they are not tied to a specific gym).I had one in the past and he wasn't counting time and strict about overtime etc. And his advice goes beyond the gym, giving me food advice and lifestyle changes. Hope that helps!0 comments1"
