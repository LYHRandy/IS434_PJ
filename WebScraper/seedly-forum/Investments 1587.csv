1,"Tammie TeoLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 17 Apr 2019Start to put a small sum (even if it’s $100 a month) aside to either start investing in low risk passive assets like bonds or ETFS with roboadvisors. Even though you may not have a huge income yet, investments and the compounding effect of it are what will matter 30 years down the road, so it’s never too early to start!0 comments0"
