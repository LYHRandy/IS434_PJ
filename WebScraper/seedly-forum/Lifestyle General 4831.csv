question,Lifestyle General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 24 May 2019What is the best broadband service provider if I only want to sign a 1-1.5y contract?I’m planning to do rental for 1-1.5y and would like to subscribe for internet broadband for the rental place before moving to my actual place. I’m open to the idea of signing for 2y internet broadband contract if the moving/change location fee is nil or low.1 answerAnswerBump3

1,"Sarah Chan, Business Administration at NUSLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 30 May 2019Hey there anon! I recently faced this dilemma when I was moving from my rented place too. Here is my two cents based on a little research as well as the help of this detailed Seedly article on the best fibre broadband plan available in Singapore!All of my analysis and deductions would be based off 1 Gbps of broadband services. I assume that 1 Gbps would be sufficient for you and your household because it is for me!TL;DR: Which Is The Best Broadband Service For A Rental Home Of 1 to 1.5 Years?First, determine what your household’s WiFi usage is like on a monthly basis (500 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 2 Gbps, other features for gamers, etc)If 1 Gbps is sufficient for you, then based on my analysis, MyRepublic is the most inexpensive when it comes to monthly subscription and relocation fees. M1 is a close 2nd.If you’re looking into getting additional services (e.g. TV, Google Home .etc), perhaps you should compare the add-ons and bundles catered by each service provider before settling on the most inexpensive one. Some of these service providers’ price tags are more pocket-friendly when you factor in the additional services.What About My Personal Choice? I would choose Singtel.My household has been using Singtel for ages and we’re pretty satisfied with their services (#notsponsored, just some honest thoughts).It’s more worth it as well because we’re using Singtel’s Mobile and TV plan too. Have a look at their bundle plan to see if it’s more worth it based on your household’s needs!Their monthly subscription and relocation fees might be on the steeper end, but one aspect of their service that we really enjoy is the free access to Singtel WiFi hotspot around Singapore. The free WiFi is a true lifesaver when you desperately need WiFi while you’re out and your 4G data usage is about to ‘bao’ (bao means explode in Chinese and it’s often used to describe the scenario when we exceed our monthly 4G usage).I would like to add that Singtel’s customer service is pretty efficient too.Whenever we face WiFi connection issues, the assistance rendered by their customer service centre is rather prompt and clear - I guess the steeper price we pay is well spent at the end of the day!Other Things To NoteOther one-time charges may be applicable if you require any additional work to be done by the service provider. These costs will be advised at the point of your application or during your relocation appointment.If you’d like, you can also read user reviews on Seedly Reviews to learn more about what real users have to say about the different broadband service providers:SingtelStarhubM1ViewqwestMyRepublicWhizcommsI hope this info is helpful to you! :-)0 comments8"
