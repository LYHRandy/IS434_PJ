question,"AIA Life Protection Investment Linked Policies (ILP) Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 03 Aug 2019Why am I not getting a full refund from surrendering my AIA ILP?I have decided to cancel my ILP after 1 year. I called AIA customer service the day I received the payment notice of $3k (on 12 Jul) to cancel it because they automatically charged it to my credit card. They told me that I need to cancel it before 12 Aug to get the refund from AIA, so I can use the money to pay for my credit card. I met up with my agent to submit the withdrawal forms. However, instead of receiving the full $3k, I only got $800 from it? Why is this so even though I cancelled it?1 answerAnswerBump0"

When I received the charge to my credit card, I immediately called AIA customer service and told them I want to cancel and not pay for the 2nd year premiums. The guy over the phone told me that I need to do it before 12 Aug. But now AIA has only refunded me partially because it is considered surrendering the plan instead of lapsing/cancelling it.Loh Tat Tian04 Aug 2019There are two parts of the plan

1) The current surrender value of the 1st year. You should have received maybe only 25% of the premiums paid for the first year (because of the surrender charge etc). So this is a ""partial refund"".

2) For the 2nd year premiums, likely you need to dispute with them in totality. Do yo... (more)"
