1,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Nov 2018Since you'll need the money for your University tuition fees, I'd suggest playing safe by only putting your money in it Singapore Savings Bond, a high interest Fixed Deposit account (e.g. CIMB's 12 months 1.90%) or a high interest savings account (e.g. CIMB FastSaver). If you have spare funds after setting aside money for your tuition fees and emergency funds, then you can try investing. Rule of thumb is to only invest with money that you can afford to lose. 0 comments0"
2,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Nov 2018Depending on how long till your uni. If it's 1-2 years maybe not touch it. If say like 5 years you can try bonds. Any longer can try stocks. While investing aims to provide you with returns, some investments may not provide such within a short time span.0 comments0"
