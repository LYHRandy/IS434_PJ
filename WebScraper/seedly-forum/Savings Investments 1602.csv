1,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Apr 20191) You wouldnt require the S$65,000 straightaway. I would suggest to combine your money with your spouse to set up a joint account for Citibank Maxigain and keep S$70,000 there for emergency funds. (This is for the money that you and your spouse will not need to touch unless an uneventful situation crops up) As for the money that you intend to draw down, you can consider SSBs or CIMB fastsaver which has no spending nor salary crediting requirements.2) Even if you decide to stop work temporarily to care for your child, you still need to retire eventually. Being a low to middle risk taker, some suggestions would be to place the money into fixed income funds, Balanced Equity Funds, Endowment Plans. Unless you are sure that you do not need the cash at all, you may consider topping up your CPF SA which gives a guaranteed 4% return.3) As suggested in point 2, you may consider the options that were suggested given your risk profile.You may also reach out to me via  https://www.facebook.com/brandan.chen  should you like a deeper discussion.0 comments0"

There are also high interest savings account like UOB one with no salary crediting but $500 credit card spending. You can also look at CIMB fastsaver with no requirement and gives 1%.0 comments0"
