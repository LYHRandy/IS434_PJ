Only default will be if government defaulted. ETFs will be riskier, following market conditions. There will be dividends(if applicable) and capital gains. 0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 25 Sep 2018If you are young with no or little responsibility and willing to take some risk, go for 80%ETFs and put like 20% in SSB. If you scared, then put SSB. You can even put 100% in ETF if you dare since its your money. You have to google and do some research to see which suits you.0 comments1"
