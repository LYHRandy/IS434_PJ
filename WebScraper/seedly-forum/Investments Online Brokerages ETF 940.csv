1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 26 Jun 2019The common brokers brandished here are Td Ameritrade and interactive brokers. Both will allow you to access the US market. I'm using TD Ameritrade personally and I find it very user friendly, with a great charting tool. There are no inactivity, custodian or data feed fees as well.2 comments0"
