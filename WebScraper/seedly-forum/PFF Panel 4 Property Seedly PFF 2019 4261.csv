1,"Jefremy Juari, Financial Writer at Medina BooksLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 12 Jul 2019With 50k you can buy many assets. Did you know in 2017, Singapore's medical inflation rate was 10%. It means your money is worth 10% less today compared to last year. 2.5%? Any good asset with cash flow could beat that even with no capital appreciation. Don't burn your money so easily.0 comments0"

WonderkidAnswered on 12 Jul 2019Unless you have an investment that earns you more then 2.5%, do a CPF cash refund!Basically you are putting the cash into your OA, which will earn 2.5%. So you if you somehow decided to just use the money to pay HDB loan, then just leave the money in OA and continue paying off the HDB loan.But if you somehow want to spend on an investment, you can do an CPFIS. In the future CPFIS will be 0% fees!0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 02 Mar 2019If you are confident in getting more than 2.5% returns, by all mean do what you feel is the best for you. However, a lot times investments returns are not guaranteed but loan/debts interest are guaranteed.0 comments0"
