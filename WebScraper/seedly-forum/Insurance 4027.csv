1,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Nov 2018At your age, a Term Plan to Age 65 will be very cheap (premiums less than $700 yearly) for a $1million coverage policy. You benefit from1) Large Sum assured insurance discount (of 10-15%)2) Low age of entry for Term Insurance. (cheaper again)3) For CI, it will be more prudent to get about $100,000 tagged to a whole life plan. But due to budget constraints, you may just wish to tag to the term policy.4) Future HPS (if you bought BTO) can be pledged with this term insurance5) TPD coverage is significant enough.6) Reducing sum assured later is easier and cheaper.0 comments0"

3,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Oct 2018Get a Term plan that gives you an option to purchase more in the future without medical underwriting. That's likely the best advice I can give based on the limited information thats being provided. That way, you ensure your insurability in the future while it gives you  the flexibility to change Term plans, up your coverage or convert to a Whole Life plan later. I typically recommend between $60,000 to $120,000 in coverage because someone unemployed or who hasn't locked down their working future prospects shouldn't be spending more than $1000/mth for 5 years, unless they happen to have different circumstances such as part time degree and full time work, part time work, large amounts of savings, parents willing to pay for the first few years, etc. There are many individual cases.You can always drop me a PM if you'd like to know more. https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
