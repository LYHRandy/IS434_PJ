1,"Sim Min XuanLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 22 Jun 2019My teacher has talked to us about this before, so iâ€™ll just dump whatever he had told us here. if youâ€™re interested more in it, you can google to learn more about it. my information might be incorrect in some form or another so read with an open mind!In Singapore, there are no flats that have reached 99 years yet. However, a lot of flats have already surpassed the 40 years mark. The state will be issued back the land after 99 years are up, where they will renovate or demolish the entire building before putting it up on sale again.As for the owners, they have to leave their property with no compensation when their lease have expired with no way of renewing or extending it.3 comments2"
