1,"Terence Tan, Finance at Singapore Management UniversityLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 21 Mar 2019Smaller free float - if suddenly high demand, price will rise significantly. On the other side of the coin, if nothing happens, you get stuck.Bigger free float - the opposite happens.Rather than look at free float, it is better to look at the fundamentals behind the companies.Nevertheless, ceteris paribus, I will choose a company with 50% till 70% insider holding company.0 comments0"
