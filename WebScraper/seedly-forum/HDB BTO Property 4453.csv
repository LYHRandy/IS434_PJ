3,Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Tengah looks good but bear in mind that the Jurong Region Line Stage 1 will only start operating in 2026. JE MRT station is also very crowded during peak hours. How do people deal with the morning crowd at JE anyway!1 comment2
4,Tee-Ming Chew14 Nov 2018Woah valid point... JE MRT will be crowded during peak hours...

6,"See all 4 comments Billy Ong01 Nov 2018But one of my many reasons is that both my partner and I are currently staying in the west. It will be ideal for us to apply for somewhere in the west. Next, being a new town, we would expect the price to be more than reasonable. Sure, amenities may not be there. But we are near to Jurong East and Bukit batok so that shouldn't be an issue Question Poster01 Nov 2018Thank you for getting back! :)"

8,Kenneth Lou11 Oct 2018Haha bro already long time no more :( I was also planning to get there. But when I applied in the last batch (Feb 2018 iirc) it was 4 couples fighting for 1 unit. LOL.

WizardAnswered on 11 Oct 2018As someone who tried 7 times (in mature estate) before getting on my 8th try, I highly recommend to 'Mai Tu Liao' if you see something you really like, and 80% confident that it's a liveable neighbourhood, I would say just try. It's only $10 to get a ballot chance and fill up some forms which will take you guys maybe 1hour? :) Go for it!0 comments0"
