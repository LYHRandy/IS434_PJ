1,"Tai Zhi, Chief Investment Officer at AutowealthLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 07 May 2019I have explained this during the live session earlier.Superior ReturnsOur market-returns investment approach achieve higher returns than mutual funds (unit trusts). You may wish to read more at the following url  https://www.autowealth.sg/strategy.php Btw, this outperformance is not just because of lower fees, but also because we deliver higher performance from an investment strategy perspective. Lower FeesRoboadvisors charge way lower fees, so you get to keep almost all of the investment returns.Hassle-free and Higher ControlYou get to track your investments 24/7. The process to start an investment account is also easier.Stronger Safeguards Unlike buying into a mutual fund or investing through other robo-advisors, your portfolio assets and monies are held in a personal and segregated custody account at our partnering MAS-licensed custodian. This personal and segregated custody is held in your legal name for your legal benefit only. This means that portfolio assets and monies legally belong to you and are fully segregated from AutoWealth or Saxo Capital Marketâ€™s own assets and monies. It is also not commingled with other client's assets. No sharing of ETF units, no sharing of custody accounts. This is your hard-earned savings and wealth. :)0 comments0"
