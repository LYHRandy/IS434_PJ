2,"Question Poster17 Apr 2019Thank you for your reply. The prices between VUSD & CSPX are so great. Why is this so?Nicholes Wong17 Apr 2019Im not too sure as that are the prices that the ETF company sets based on their NAV and other than cheaper ETFs you can buy more, there shouldnt be any important difference. The performance and cost are the more important factors."
