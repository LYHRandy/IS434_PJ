1,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 01 May 2019Nikko AM STI ETF already contains Singapore Exchange Limited. Your OCBC blue chip investment kinda overlaps in this sense. Not sure what unit trusts those are but if the historical 10 yr+ performance was decent, perhaps hold on to it.Funding societies is fine but be aware of the risks of defaulting loans. Stashaway so far so good.Holding physical gold, this one there are alot of differing views. Some prefer physical because of apocalyptic events. But take note gold does not generate value, no dividends. You just wait for someone else willing to pay higher than your buy.0 comments0"
2,"TWTay WenHaoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 01 May 2019In my personal opinion:You can consider to change the $100/mth in ABF to Nikko AM (total of $200), OR in OCBC BCIP (total of $200 in SGX). Cus i feel that for ABF its too stable in the sense that the returns are only from dividend yield (2~3%) and there's no value appreciation (aka increase in the paper value)As mentioned above you can consider to increase OCBC BCIP to $200 because the sales charge is flat $5 (or 0.30%). It means that regardless you put $100 or $200 per month the charges are the same. As for SGX stock i think its fine because the dividends has been stable at about ~4% so far (better than ABF bond).I think loss of about 3% is fine (common). Do some research and see if its worth it to continue buying (DCA/value averaging to average down your cost). If you are unsure, my recommendation is to just stop buying and use the 'wait and see' approach. Or you can also sell some to reduce loss if you think it will continue dropping.As for point 6. I feel that physical gold and necklaces value wont appreciate as fast as stocks and also doesnt payout 'dividends' so not really worth it unless you are wearing it.0 comments0"
