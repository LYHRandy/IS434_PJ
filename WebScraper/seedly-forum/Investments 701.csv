God of WisdomAnswered on 10 Aug 2019Usually at most you should hold 6 months of income as cash and money you die die need in less than 3 years. Everything else should be invested in a globally diversified portfolio.You're young and can take more risk and invest in a majority equity portfolio.0 comments2"
2,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 10 Aug 2019By waiting for a bear market, you are already timing the market. When is the next bear market? If it took another 10 years, you would miss out the dividends and potential growth. Gurus have thrown up studies about a crash every 7 years. It's now 10 years since the last crash. Could this be a continuation of the bull or a new bear? We never know. Invest soon. Invest consistently. Stay the course.0 comments1"
