Grand MasterAnswered 2w agoYou can use a broker that has a presence in Singapore (local SG bank account) then you can transfer SGD to the broker to change into USAI actually transfer money to my Bank of America's account in this way.Transfer SGD to Interactive Broker's SGD accountGet the SGD converted to USD (bonus the FX rate is good!)After a few days, transfer the USD from my IB to my Bank Of America banking accountNo fees and excellent FX. Just that I need a few days to wait, as the broker doesn't allow new fresh funds to be transferred out so fast.0 comments0"
