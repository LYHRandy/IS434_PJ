question,"Credit Card Savings Bank Account DBS Multiplier POSB Everyday Card Expenses Salary Asked by AnonymousAsked on 06 Aug 2019Do I really need a credit card?I am looking into ways to maximize my income. I have opened up a DBS Multiplier account and set my salary to be credited into that account instead of my POSBkids account. Currently, I am looking at getting a credit card (POSB Everyday) to earn some cashback when being used to pay for bills and purchases. However, I'm intimidated by the annual and primary fee. I do not spend much on myself but most of the money goes to paying for insurance/savings polices (about $900). Any advice?1 answerAnswerBump0"

If in the case where the bank don't waive the annual fee, you can cancel and apply for another card. Till now, I do not have a problem waiving the annual fees for DBS/ POSB credit cards.As for the insurance/ endowment plans portion, you can find other cards that will give you cashback for insurance premiums (Do read the Terms & conditions for the exclusion part) 
Also, take note that some insurer companies do not accept giro payment of the premiums via credit card.0 comments0"
