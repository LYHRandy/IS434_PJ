1,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Did you do the entire OA transfer to SA in January 2018 for the first contribution or is it done in mid of the year?OA interest is calculated based on the lowest balance of the month. Hence if you transfer all your CPF contribution from OA to SA, there should not be any interest. Unless CPF has changed their interest calculations. 1 comment1"
