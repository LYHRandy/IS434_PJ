WizardAnswered on 21 Sep 2018Instead of the above, I suggest you go with this hack contributed by Seedly community members, get more cash back of couple hundreds a year. See the links below: ​https://blog.seedly.sg/cashback-hack-interest-posb-bonus-cashback-cimb-fastsaver-dbs-multiplier/​Summary: Ops for POSB Cash back bonus saver  + CIMB fast saver 1% p.a 1) Use POSB cash back bonus saver by:   (a) credit your salary ini  (b) spend at least $1 on any POSB / DBS credit card (c) Buy investment such as POSB Invest savers using Nikkoa AM STI ETC etc. ​2) Put your savings into CIMB fast saver 1% p.a  and earn easy interest​​Next, my personal though is that: 3) With your spending of $300-600 on groceries, food, entertainment, EZ-Link and M1 bills) If you can spend another $100 on something to make it $700, then apply BOC family visa card and get cash back on all the category: ​ => By spending on BOC family visa, you can get cash back of another $20 to $50 every month! More $$$ back for your bang!! ​  The BOC Family card cash back details and T&C: http://pic.bankofchina.com/bocappd/singapore/201803/P020180327710875490784.pdf0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 21 Sep 2018are you a miles chaser ? ​I think the DBS attitude Card is good for the no min spend + miles doesn’t expire. ​If miles are are not your thing then go with the posb Everyday Card spend 1 dollar on it.​Go for other Credit cards such as the UOB one or BOC that give you better cash rebates. 0 comments0"

6,Chen Yong NgLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 16 Jun 2018POSB Everyday card as you have to hit minimum spend of 600 dollars for the cashback from DBS Live Fresh. 0 comments0
7,Hannah FooLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 15 Jun 2018I would recommend the POSB Everyday card. It allows you to offset the rebates earned against your monthly bill. I have both cards but use the POSB Everyday card as my default card0 comments0
