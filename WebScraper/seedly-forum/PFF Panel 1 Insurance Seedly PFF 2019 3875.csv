1,"Allan LeeLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 09 Apr 2019An advice to you here is to check how much premium have been paid, what is the current value of the policy and what are the cost of insurance for all the plans (This can be costly when the age of the life assured is higher than 50.)0 comments0"

So someone has been teaching you wrong things.You can consult someone to see if you should surrender them or not. While what you're saying doesn't sound favorable at the moment, we won't know till we get a close look at them.  https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
