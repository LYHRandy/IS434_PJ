1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 14 Sep 2019Breaking things down from now till the end of the year:
1. Savings - $1k to cover 4 months. More information is required here, do you still take allowance from family? If not, $250 a month to cover all your expenses might not be feasible.
2. No time to work: If this is non-negotiable, then income till the end of the year = $0.3. Bursary not given out yet: Cashflow issue, but I think it's good practice to inculcate good saving and investing habits from a young age.4. Laptop - is a new one really required, and how will you finance it?: Is the need to change the laptop really a need, or more of a want? I agree with Gabriel that it does not make sense to get a loan if you are not able to pay it back. Additionally, as an undergrad, I believe you will have access to computer labs etc.0 comments4"

Grand MasterAnswered on 12 Sep 2019Your question is how to start saving money...and you ended the question on a credit card loan.I am not sure why no time to work, perhaps you can try to find work that helps you in flexi hours? Tuition for kids, small part-time creative work you can freelance at upwork or fiverr. Give yourself some motivation, work well for 3 mths and you can have a good laptop, no interests. And then extra money to keep and save.If you really have to have a laptop, go to carousell and look for 2nd hand refurbished. Extremely cheap and value for money, especially those bought and refurbished by sim lim square shops.0 comments1"

Try not to sign a credit card loan if you have no means to pay back in the subsequent months. The interest rate will snowball out of control. If there are 0% instalment plans, you have to take note of extra fees and charges as well as any hidden increase in the price of the laptop.0 comments1"
