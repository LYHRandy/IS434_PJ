1,"Soh Sing Heng, Financial Blogger at SG Young InvestmentLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 09 Sep 2018I first got interested through a book titled rich dad poor dad. This book inspired me to save up and buy assets (which is investing) that puts money in my pocket. Thereafter, I begin reading more books to learn. A big part of my investing journey is through failures where I learnt what works and what does not work for me. â€‹I have some books which I recommend on my blog. These are the books which I personally felt helped me in learning about investing and personal financial planning as well.
