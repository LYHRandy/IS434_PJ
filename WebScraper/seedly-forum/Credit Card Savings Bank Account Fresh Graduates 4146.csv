1,"Yinghua LiuLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Depends on a lot of factors. Let’s say you are earning salary of 2800 (after cpf deduction), spend $500 a month and current saving balance of 10k.DBS Multiplier -1.85%Salary credited to any posb/dbs account under your nameNo min spend on DBS credit card (any amount will do)
Eligible transaction per month 3300, thus giving you 1.85%UOB One -1.85%first 15k - 1.5% min spend of $500 on credit or debit card (MUST)first 15k - 1.85% if meet credit card spend and giro 3 bills/credit salaryOCBC 360 - 1.5%first 35k - 1.2% if salary creditedfirst 35k - 0.3% if min spend of $500 on ocbc credit cardBased on the above assumption, either DBS Multiplier or UOB One is good. 
If you spend less than $500 a month on credit cards, you can go for DBS Multiplier.
If you have 3 bills to giro, you can open both DBS Multiplier and UOB one as UOB one doesn’t require salary crediting as mandatory component compared to DBS, OCBC.You can also refer to the link on comparison by Seedly.

2,"Yvonne Isabelle01 May 2019Thanks for the information! It's really helpfulThu Nguyen21h ago2 common misconceptions here: 1) the 360 account doesn’t make crediting your salary compulsory 2) the 360 account has an often overlooked 0.3% interest if your account balance increases by $500/ month which makes it on par with Multiplier and UOB One. 

At the end of the day, as it is a relationship account think carefully where likely you’ll pick up a credit card of choice and invest with."
3,"Vinc TayLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 02 May 2019If you’re not yet earning a salary, pretty much none of the multiplier accounts would be useful to you. Nevertheless, the rule of thumb is that it usually depends on your salary amount, your monthly expenditure via debit card / credit card, and GIRO payment for bills.0 comments0"
