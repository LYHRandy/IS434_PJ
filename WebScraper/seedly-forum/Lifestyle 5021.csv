MasterAnswered on 15 Dec 2018Perhaps do a list of the games that both you and your gf can enjoy together, to see if it's worth splurging on one set and the games. Then start setting aside funds over a period of time to go towards the console. Discounts will always be there, just be prepared for the opportunity when it comes. Gaming is fun, but can be costly over time due to the games and consoles available. 0 comments0"

3,Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Dec 2018I think it's alright to get it to pamper yourself & your gf especially when it's on sale and you've been eyeing on it! Most importantly is that you'll use/play with it in the long run instead of just playing it for a few days/weeks then leave it to collect dust. 0 comments0
4,"Daniel Lee, Growth Marketing Lead at SeedlyLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 13 Dec 2018It depends on whether your emergency fund is safe and still growing, and you can afford to dip into your savings to get it. It's alright to splurge a little once in awhile, and it makes it easier since there are sales going on. Alternatively, have a chat with you gf about it and discuss about sharing the cost of the switch. I actually have that arrangement and we now both jointly own the console. 0 comments0"
