question,"Savings Lifestyle Career Asked by Lucas NeoAsked on 10 Aug 2019Working towards generating more income despite NS obligations. ?I guess it is safe to say that most soon-to-be NSF or current NSF who frequent Seedly are looking to/saving their NS Allowance diligently for their future plans after NS. This then leads me to my next point, regarding working towards generating more income to gain an even further headstart in your personal finance compared to your peers. Either taking your free time to hone your skillsets in a certain area or even moonlighting. What are everyone's thoughts about this?1 answerAnswerBump1"

1,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 18 Aug 2019Hi there! NSF here too. I would strongly discourage you to moonlight during your 2-year service. Just last year, a staff sergeant was fined $2000 for using GrabHitch ride app to give rides (he only earned about $1.2k from the 140 rides). It is a tremendous waste if you are caught. On the other hand, you can take on projects to upgrade your skillsets or learn new hobbies, but not for monetary gain. If you desperately need the money, talk to your commander. Only your CO can give permission (if required).If you just enlisted, I would urge you to strive hard and maybe even attend command school. It is free on the ground leadership training; a practical skill which many companies spend tens of thousands to recruit leadership mentors to teach their employees. After all, which other organisation in the world gives 19-year-olds the responsibility of at least the lives of 6 others?If you have enlisted for already a period, fret not. When you ORD, you will be given a testimonial equivalent to a performance review. Putting in the best effort in your daily tasks and building a good rapport with your teammates will definitely make your certificate stand out compared to your peers. This paper can also be used for interviews especially if you received a significant award.All the best!2 comments2"
2,"LNLucas Neo18 Aug 2019Thanks for your response Yang Teng! Personally Iâ€™m looking at the direction of honing personal skillsets for the betterment of self and for future career developments. What are your thoughts and experiences in these areas?Lok Yang Teng18 Aug 2019Hi Lucas, there are endless ways for you to learn these skills. You can watch tutorials on YouTube at your own learning pace. You can approach people working in the relevant field for their mentorship. You can sign up for 1-2 day courses during the weekends. While SkillsFuture may not be applicable for your current age, the e-PREP Scheme becomes available (+/- 1 year of ORD date) where MINDEF will subsidise up to 90% of the course fee from selected courses."
