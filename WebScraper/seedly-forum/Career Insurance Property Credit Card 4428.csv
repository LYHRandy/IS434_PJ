1,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Dec 2018If you are broke, I'd suggest not getting a credit card.However, if you must, I would suggest checking out the cards' eligibility on the cards' websites. Usually you'd have to have an income of $30k annually. 0 comments1"
2,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 09 Dec 2018Hi, you can apply for a credit card so long as you meet the card's requirement(s) which is usually having a minimum annual income of $30k. However for your case, I'd suggest not to get a credit card if you feel that you won't be able to pay the credit card bill on time as it'll incur late payment charges and interest fees which is pretty high. You should consider getting a debit card instead0 comments1"

4,"Elsa GohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 11 Dec 2018Is there any particular reason you need a credit card? Are there alternative modes of payment, eg topping up with cash, or payment by GIRO? If not, a credit card isn't that great honestly. U still have to pay the bill at the end of the month. Whenever i see the bill i feel very sad.0 comments0"

ProdigyAnswered on 11 Dec 2018If you need to Ask this questions, it would be best to re phrase.Instead Ask, should I get a credit card?Getting a CC is like the easiest thing now. Walk to any booth, almost every shopping mall will have at least one on a weekend.Unless you are asking how when you cannot through normal means.
Then you have asked at the wrong place.0 comments0"
