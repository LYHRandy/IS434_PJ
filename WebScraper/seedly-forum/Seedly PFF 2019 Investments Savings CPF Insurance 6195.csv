4,"Serene TohLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Actually CPF seems to be a big discussion point. It would be interesting to have an educated debate on the Pros & Cons of CPF as an Investment & Retirement Strategy.P/s: For the less financially educated masses, I would highly recommend CPF to them, but it might not be the best product for the more financially savvy.3 comments4"
5,"See all 3 comments Serene Toh26 Apr 2019That comment was more of a question than a statement. I do support the use of CPF. But I realised that the forum is too Pro CPF, so kinda want the discussion to balance it out a bit. So that the issues for the doubtful people can be properly address, and we can't do that unless we look at the cons. You can't really convince people unless you make them feel that you heard them. Problem is, this is such a sensitive issue,that if not handled delicately, might blow up in our faces.Loh Tat Tian15 May 2019CPF risk are always there.
