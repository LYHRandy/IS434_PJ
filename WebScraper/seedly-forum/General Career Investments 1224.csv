1,"Guo Hao Teo, Self-Taught Enthusiast at Personal FinanceLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 09 Jun 2019You can try using Carousell? Start from there.Itâ€™s possible to actually find a ton of home bakers there selling their home made cakes and produce. Do check it out!I think until it becomes bigger, then you should consider getting the relevant licenses and filing with ARCA.Because administration can be a hassle.2 comments2"
