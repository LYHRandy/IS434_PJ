1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Apr 2019Basically in essence, VIX is the expectations on volatility on the S&P500. In its derivation, I believe VIX is calculated over a 30 day range of put vs calls in SPX (S&P Index). I recommend you search up more online if you are curious.Here's a technical analysis chart on VIX I saw. Not sure exactly how credible this analysis is though(what specific indicators he based it off)TLDR: Wouldn't recommend longing or shorting VIX. You are essentially investing in the   expectated volatility increasing/decreasing which is essentially market timing.0 comments1"
