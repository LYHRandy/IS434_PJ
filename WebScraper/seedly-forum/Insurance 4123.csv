question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 14 Aug 2018Is early critical illness insurance coverage a must for kids?I’m planning to buy a whole life plan for my 4 year old kid as premiums will be low and his insurability is high now, and I chanced upon the option to add in Early CI as a rider, I personally feel that CI coverage is a must, but am unsure about the need for early CI, especially for a young kid. Would love some inputs about this to see if the extra $5 per month is worth it anot for the lowest amount. Oh and of course he is covered under hospitalisation and PA already.3 answersAnswerBump0"

The purpose of CI coverage is mainly to cover loss of income and some outpatient treatment, as most inpatient treatment is already covered by a good hospitalisation policy. In the event of a person being diagnose for early CI, it is less likely that the person will suffer from long term disability. More likely, a short inpatient treatment will be able to fully fixed the problem, follow with short rest at home. The person is not likely to be out of action for too long. So if you still want early CI, just buy a bit, most of the CI should still be advance stage CI. As a rule of thumb, up to 25% of your coverage maybe early CI, the other 75% still advance CI. Early CI is more than twice the cost of advance stage CI.0 comments2"

Great question.​Actually Early CI has more benefits for juveniles as there is extra cover for 8 to 11 Juvenile specific conditions. ​Now on to how much should you cover for?​In a dual income household, if the child falls ill, one parent may stop working to take care of your child. There's a loss of income here. I'd opt to get 3 years of one parent's Annual Income as cover.​For a single income household, you may need to now employ a domestic helper to help your spouse with the daily chores on top of her taking care of your child. There's extra cost here. So I'd opt to get about 3 years of this extra expense as cover.0 comments0"
