question,Family Lifestyle Asked by Charmaine NgAsked on 14 Jun 2019Overheard in the lift today. Woman purposefully brought her kids to China so they are forced to speak Mandarin. Now question; how far would you go to buy an experience for your children? If you do not have kids now - imagine if you have one.Assumption that financially - buying the experience is not an issue. Just that would you buy the experience since this is unlike tuition; with a sysetmatic way.. with a syllabus etc. And can either turn out very well like the kids who had to use Mandarin because they had no choice.. or for the more resourceful ones; to use a one mini translator on the go.3 answersAnswerBump3

Looking for jobs, can also see that some require mandarin speaking to liase with China partners.My madarin sucks because my parents also don't know mandarin (last time can choose malay or mandarin) . Speaking basic is ok but reading and writing really kosong. And it is quite a pity because as I grew up, I also start to appreciate more chinese culture like the traditional chinese music orchestra, those gu qin musics, chinese history and famous stories (translated in english).And it is not easy to pick up mandarin during adult life because the chance to practise it is greatly reduced. Even LKY mentioned in his books, it was very tough for him to pick up mandarin in his later years.12 comments4"

3,"MujimoroLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 16 Jun 2019My train of thought is that as a father, my job is to expose my daughter to as many stimuli / environments & experiences as I can and really understand her interests and natural talents. That way I can hone in to further develop those interests and nurture them so that she reaches her max potential.In the context of the woman you mentioned, I would see if the child had a natural knack for picking up languages. I wouldn’t force it on them..What are your thoughts?3 comments2"
4,"See all 3 comments Charmaine Ng16 Jun 2019I agree!  I don't have a kid yet but I do have a nephew and I like to expose him to different situations and stimuli too to see how he reacts; how he learn best etc. However for my own part I do not believe spending money for an experience is the only way because imparting money value is important too. So what happen is when my nephew ask if my mother knows we are a ""English speaking family"" which obviously we are not; I refuse to speak to him until he speaks Mandarin with us.Charmaine Ng16 Jun 2019It works and now he would ask me for translation if he doesn't know what is the correct word and his Mandarin is much better. Perhaps if it was a trip to say Cambodia to witness first hand how bad others situation are and how they make the best out of it or to voluntary work overseas I would be more inclined to spend the $."

RookieAnswered on 14 Jun 2019Given how china’s economy has been on a uptrend and there is a big market for business, it’s definitely practical to have my kids have an experience of speaking in their mother tongue. Plus, it’s a way to connect to their great grandparents, be it in pictures or the language used!0 comments1"
