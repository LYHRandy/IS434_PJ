It's great (to the extent of available info), and I use its reporting to track and monitor when and how much dividends I get. And shared portfolios allow me to benchmark against other folks.But I guess your question isnt just about how to track and monitor the returns. One other useful feature is it sets an ES3 benchmark which I believe it assumes if you had processed your transactions using ES3 which is one of the Straits Times Index funds. So you can see if you are doing better or worse than if you had just bought the index fund? I think so, better ask Evan lol.There have been times I did worse than the index (in my srs investments). I bought qaf and accordia golf reading blogs, and I think that cost me a lot of tuition fees (ie 3k realized losses).I tried for quite a while to figure why I wasn't doing so well, and in jul 2018, I awakened / 领悟 the real way of investing and I have been doing at least better than the index since then.I am not sure if that's what you want to know though. I have put some of my investing logic in posts here and there. And it may not be the best, but I think it works for me.0 comments1"

WizardAnswered on 26 Jun 2019I use stocks.cafe to track and manage my portfolio.Good platform to see your performance, returns and dividends.I try to keep each stock at a certain % of my portfolio so as not to overweight any stock. If I have 10 stocks, keeping them at 10% allocation, then I know which one to add which to sell.0 comments1"
