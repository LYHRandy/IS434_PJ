1,"SYSamuel YipLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 27 Jun 2019They could have already reached their maximum exposure. That is, they have already maxed out what the banks are willing to lend.They could also have really weak financials and have little to offer as collaterals. If SMES are relatively new, financial performance would be hard to project for loan calculations. Hope this helps.0 comments1"
