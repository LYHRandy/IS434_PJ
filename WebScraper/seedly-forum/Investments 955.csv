1,"Darren ChewLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 23 Jun 2019Based on your question, you seen to be keen to invest for dividend using unit trust.
This fund is also available at POEMS and the name as Eastspring Investments - Asian Equity Income Fund. It paid dividend monthly and the annual dividend is around 4.75%you can get invest in this fund yourself is you have a POEMS account with Phillip Securities.There are no sales charges, switching fee and platform fee on POEMSBy doing that you immediately save a lot of cost on your investment and your dividend payout will sure be higher.However, do take note that this fund invest 100% in Asia Equity which means that the volatility is not low.  You may suffer double digit loss in capital when there is a market downturn despite you still getting the dividend.if you plan to invest 100k for dividend income in unit trust, i would suggest you created a diversified unit trust portfolio, spread across 5 to 8 funds to bring down the portfolio volatility and at the same time achieved a dividend yield of 4% to 5% per year.A typical dividend UT portfolio can comprise  of1) Asian Equity fund - for capital appreciation and dividend2) Asian Balanced fund - for dividend3) Asian High Yield bond fund - for dividend4) Global balanced or bond fund - for dividend5) Short Duration bond fund - for tactical allocation when there is opportunitiesThis allocation would easily bring down your volatility of your portfolio by half and getting about the same amount of dividend when compare to just putting 100k into an equity income fundHope that help.0 comments6"
2,"DeleteEditElijah LeeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 24 Jun 2019Hi, the underlying fund is the Eastspring Investments - Asian Equity Income Fund. You can actually buy this fund directly on brokerage platforms like POEMS where your full investment amount will be deployed. (I.e. no bid offer spread). Hence you won't have to pay the Initial Investment Charge of 5%. The payout to you will still be the same.If you are looking for income, I recommend diversifying your money across a few funds (if you are looking at funds only). If not, do consider deploying over various asset classes that are both guaranteed and variable.2 comments6"
3,"Question Poster22 Jun 2019Can you elaborate on what funds are good? There are so many on market. Also what are the various asset classes that are both guaranteed and variable.Elijah Lee24 Jun 2019DeleteEditYes. There are many other funds on the market that give dividend payout. Hence to see if a fund is good is dependent on several factors like their volatility, sharpe ratio, etc. The important thing is to have a good diversification of your funds so that your risk-adjusted returns are acceptable to you.

For asset classes that are guaranteed, you can consider bonds or annuities that can give a lifetime of income in perpetuity.  Variable asset classes can include shares and ETFs."
4,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusUpdated on 22 Jun 2019The transaction cost for ssb is $2, highly redeemable, and 10 yr average yield is slightly above 2%.In the case you cited, pay 100k of premiums to get 2+k payout, return is also 2+% (but this is likely excluding transaction cost).So it would seem that the SSB should be the better choice (considering lower transaction costs)? After factoring transaction costs, ssb would probably be better. 
Why are you looking at the fund again?0 comments0"
5,"Richard Chai, Financial Services Consultant at Trillion Financial PlannersLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 22 Jun 2019Would you consider investing that 100K into an Asian Fund that gives $600/mth of Dividend instead? No upfront charge, gives upfront bonus and yearly charge average of 2%3 comments0"
6,"See all 3 comments Richard Chai22 Jun 2019The fund invests in asian bonds, that gives an average of 7% +/-dividends, paid out monthly, you can treat it as a monthly passive income investment.

The platform gives upfront bonus depending on your investment size and time horizon to hold the investment and yearly charge of around 2% -2.5%(charged monthly) 

I help people to create their portfolio based on dividends as I think dividend investment is a highly predictable way of investing. We do have other funds that provides 8-9% dividends.Richard Chai22 Jun 2019Depending on your risk profile, investing in mainly treasury notes and some other combination of corporate bonds can also produce a 5% dividend payout. You may hit me up if you would like to understand more, ultimately it is how you utilize and piece together a portfolio that suits your style"
