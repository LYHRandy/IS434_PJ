2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Nov 2018No. Underwriting for smoker status is based upon application. Though on a side note, it's not a healthy habit, both physically and financially. Try to quit yeah 0 comments0"
3,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 19 Nov 2018No, it is not needed to update the insurer. It is not required in any part of the terms. Even if it is a life or critical illness policy, u also do not need to update the insurer. Underwriting is at the point of application. As long u have been truthful at the point of application. Once u have been accepted at the standard terms, changes in your habits or health condition afterwards are irelevant. You are covered by the policy. They cannot deny or reject any claims on this basis.There are only certain policies that requires update. Such as those associated with accident (change of occupation class) or if u leave Singapore (or change of citizenship status) etc.0 comments0"
