1,"Lim ChoonGuanLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 07 Aug 2019I am using it to send money back to Malaysia for last two years and so far do not have any issue. Its will take 2 to 3 days to deposit into my account in Malaysia. The fee was based on the amount you want to tranfer. So after certain amount, other platforms that charging fixed transfer fee per trasaction will be more cheaper.0 comments0"

Hence, I would recommend those that have a strong record and have been in the remittance business for a long time.InstaReM is a local company that has been in the market for about 5 years now. It is backed by Vertex Ventures, a subsidiary of Temasek Holdings. So I think it should be quite safe as the government should have enought safeguards in placed.Based on past transactions, it normally gets send within the day and the fees are exactly what you see on the website. So no hidden fees.You can check out a review done by Seedly here:https://blog.seedly.sg/international-money-transfer-platform-comparison/Hope this helps!0 comments0"
