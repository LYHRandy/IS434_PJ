I'd say keep at it!Me too doesn't like the long travel time and will always find ways to reduce them:1/ Rent a room near the workplace - the taxi rides (assuming cannot claim), the mrt rides, and time lost on commute will usually justify the cost of renting one bedroom2a/ Carpooling - I'm sure you have colleagues who stay near you, and even better, one of them could be driving to work every day. Agree on a fixed time to meet and a sum to pay (check using GrabHitch app maybe?), then go to work together!2b/ GrabHitch to find your Carpooling buddies - so if you really don't have anyone you know who stays near you and drive to work, try using GrabHitch a few times, then you will eventually find a driver who does the same route as you every day. Arrange a long-term solution from there.0 comments1"

When your time is cheap and you need the job more than the job needs you, you basically have no choice, and no money to buy car lol. But if you know how to improve your market value gradually you will realise that you have more choices to choose 1 hr travel time then 45 min then 30 min or 15 min. Usually if you can reach that point, the job needs you more than you need the job.0 comments1"

WizardUpdated on 24 Oct 2018Yes, location is a big consideration for me as I've lived lives like yours, 3 hrs to/from but I don't have Grab / Taxi, still bus / mrt /walk. So i know the time wasting / pain.  Not only does it waste time and $, it also waste a lot of energy if is just bus / mrt / walk. What i can do as much as possible if I get a seat and able to stand peacefully without needing to constantly shift, I will just read and make the time useful! So after a period of 3.5hrs daily travelling to / fro, I realize that I can make the $ back but I cannot earn back the time lost! Thus I decided to find jobs where i can reach as short as possible within an hour travelling at most.
For your case, I believer as you OT so you can claim grab or taxi ? :)Morning 1.5hrs to work and night 1.5hrs return.If your passion is in Aviation, it will always be the extreme east or Seletar area since that's where the aviation company located.Central workplace is usually Finance related or recently more FinTech related jobs, some a/c some admins. If you can switch and accept a lower pay, then might be possible but does not seems to be a wise financial decision.As your studies and passion is in Aviation, I would recommend either:1) Relocate overseas for better prospect , higher income and trainingor2) Sell your house / move to rent somewhere near work. This will helps to save time, $ and whole lot of energy.0 comments1"
4,"Rave Ong Ci DeLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 24 Oct 2018Here is what I feel. Location is important, but not the all deciding factor. It becomes a deciding factors when the travel hours are significant, ie more than 2 hours imo. 3 hours is a lot of time to be spent travelling. If you read a book very trip, I’m sure you can finish at least half a book every trip. If not, what would you be doing if you are on the trip? A few things I would also ask. Do you already own a house, planning to buy one? If planning to buy, maybe you can consider getting one nearer to your workplace? Central work places usually is finance related, e.g. Banks, insurance, and food related. Shopping centres, while present, isn’t really at full capacity at any time, except when there are freebies. I worked in Raffles Place for 2 years, so those are the more prominent jobs. If you do intend to switch industry, would you be able to go back in the event that you don’t like the new industry? If so, would there be any reduction in pay? 0 comments1"

7,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Oct 2018Just last week, my lecturer also talked about location for jobs because my classmate complained about his intern at somewhere quite far away from home. For me, its not the biggest factor but it is still a pretty important factor to consider. 3hrs of travelling is a lot of time.0 comments0"
8,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Oct 2018Location is a big factor when it comes to determining your income. You can see that aside from costing you money through Grab, it costs you time that you might be able to use more efficiently. You can see what I mean in the article below. I do advice you to look through it before deciding a career switch. If you need an advisor on this, you can also drop me a PM anytime.

9,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 24 Oct 2018Yes to me location is super important because travelling time to me I feel is often very wasted! Also whether there are good places around to eat lunch or dinner (food is an important factor personally) haha.Also, what I can learn from my colleagues (outside of work) are they just workaholics or do they also have a life which would be interesting to me that I can reference and learn from also! (for example, at work, we have a person who sews her own clothes on weekends, a part time DJ, semi-professional dancers and photographic enthusiasts.) to name a few. So it's not so boring at work!But differs heavily from individual to individual. :) Interested to hear what other people think as well.0 comments0"
