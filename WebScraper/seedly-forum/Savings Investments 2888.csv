1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Jan 2019For that sort of horizon, look to create an all weather portfolio, mix of global and local equity ETFs plus a bond fund or Etf. This idea is explored by Andrew Hallam (millionaire teacher) and Tony Robbins (money master the game). Both are good reads that you can borrow from the library or browse at kinokuniya. 0 comments0"
2,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered on 08 Jan 2019For such a long horizon and for the means of general wealth accumulation without risk or volatility, you may be interested in looking at a perpetual endowment plan with flexbility of withdrawals. One that comes to mind would be Manulife's ReadyBuilder plan. However, I would like to add that you do have the luxury to take on some risk because of your really long horizon, I would also suggest a globally diversified portfolio provided by an FA or a robo advisory. Maybe start with a dividend paying portfolio or a balanced one?0 comments1"
